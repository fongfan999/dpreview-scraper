[{"name":"Casio QV-R62","amazon_reviews":["Not so good.","I've had this camera for awhile.  Came with a little tabletop tripod, which I haven't used yet.  I still haven't figured out how to set up the red eye reduction (no I'm not a novice) or switching between the different scenes.  It gives me great pictures of nighttime or sunset skies, people, etc.  However it does have a feature called \"coupling\" where you take a picture of a person, then you stand where they stood and they take your picture and it's supposed to come out as one picture.  Again I can't figure it out.  The manual leaves much to be desired.  Both my Nikon and Canon had dials on top that you could just switch to whatever you wanted.  They also had sound for the movies, this camera doesn't.  That doesn't bother me since I don't take movies but it's a nice feature to have just in case.  Another feature it doesn't have is \"museum\" where you can shoot a picture without having to disable the flash.  If you just want to use it for pictures outdoor go for it but I'd say look around.  There are better cameras that offer more for the money.","I brought this camera some time back and I have not regretted it. I was Just looking for a digital camera only, no voice, no movie, just something to take pictures and this camera at the price and resolution was pretty good. The pictures and resolution are great and the camera sturdy I also brought a 1 gig card for it and together they make a unstoppable pair almost 400 pics at high resolution, WOW! excellent! I think fo a shutter bug like my self. It will also print directly to printer or I can copy the images directly from it on my computer with out any additional software.","This camera has probably the best and more solid metallic case I've ever seen. The quality of the materials used is incredible for a medium range camera. The 2\" screen (huge) on the back is a little bit grainy, but it's very fast and with an high refresh rate. The software on the camera is pretty good, highly customizable, but as another user already pointed out, there is no way to change the shutter time. You MUST use a tripod if taking pictures during the night (if you're using bestshot and without the flash), and they're a little bit grainy too, but pictures taken during the day are just awesome (real 6MP); there is also the choice for taking \"widescreen\" pictures (3:2) and I love that!<br /><br />Besides the night pictures, this is a great camera and for its price, built quality, and overall features, I'd definitely raccomend it to everyone!","This is a compact camera with solid metal construction.  Startup times and shutter lag are extremely fast for a digital camera.  Daytime and flash pictures are excellent.  Macro pictures of flowers are pretty sharp.  I'm also happy that the camera runs on AA batteries. Low light focusing is very good.  Nightime pictures illuminated by street lights are okay when the camera automatically chooses a shutter speed of 1/8 sec and ISO of 250.  However, anything darker than that requires the use of the nighttime scene best shot mode.  Under nighttime scene best shot mode, the camera chooses a shutter speed greater than 1/8 sec.  Often it may chose between 2-4 seconds, which means that one absolutely needs a tripod to avoid image blur caused by camera shake.  It would have been nice if the camera offered manual control of the shutter and aperature settings because I can take reasonably shake-free photos up to a shutter speed of 1/2 sec and sometimes I don't want the camera to automatically chose a shutter speed longer than I think is necessary.  Another annoyance is that the noise reduction system takes on average about ten seconds to process long exposure pictures. I suppose this frustration made me to return the camera and get a Canon A85 camera with manual controls instead even though the Canon A85 operates slower than the Casio QV-R62.","Not so good.","I've had this camera for awhile.

I have taken some wonderful pictures of my children with it.  But any time that I have tryed to take a in door video clip it is so dark you can hardly make it out.  If it the video's were clear and not so dark the camera would be perfect and I would give it 5 stars.","So far I feel this is a wonderful camera.  I have never used a digital before and the ease of using the camera and quality of printed pictures is excellent; as are the ones downloaded to your computer.<br /><br />One problem is that there is not a 'booklet' on how to work your way thru learning how to use the camera completely.  You can read it on line but the script is not visually clear.  You can order one, which I did, for $10.00.  I'm also, after many attempts, not able to send an email from the Olympus photo center with picture attached.  If any one can help me in that area, I would love to hear from you.","I love this little digital camera. The Stylus 500 has everything I was looking for: small size, 5 mega-pixel resolution, ease of use, 3X zoom, and a LCD viewing screen that I can actually see. The beauty of this camera is what it offers beyond the basics. The body is waterproof (though not for underwater pictures), so getting caught in a downpour is not cause for panic; it also keeps sand out, making it great for beach use. The lens cover is built in, and it automatically covers the lens when the power is shut off, uncovers it when you turn the camera on. The rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery keeps its charge for a surprisingly large number of uses. Although you can start taking snapshots without reading the manual and navigating the menu, the camera offers a selection of scene options such as color enhancement for still life, shoot and select for moving objects, landscape and portrait shots for crispness in both foreground and background, a sport setting to capture action without blurring, beach and snow setting for to minimize glare, a selection for taking pictures of objects behind glass, and many other options. These scene features work well, and they deliver exactly what they are supposed to. This palm-size camera also records digital home movies, with audio, that you can play back either on your television screen or through your PC software such as iMovies.<br /><br />The camera comes with a high-speed USB cable to transfer photos directly to the computer without intermediate hardware, an audio/video cables to hook up for film clip viewing, a semi-rigid black case, CD-ROMs for the software and user manual, and a 32 MB picture card. The photo transfer works on both Macs and PCs. The included software, Olympus Master, is adequate for photo management, although I prefer iPhoto. Adobe Photoshop would be even better for those who like to manipulate photos, though this kind of high-tech software is hardly necessary. You can also print directly off the camera if you choose to bypass your PC. The 32 MB XD picture card that comes with the camera is woefully inadequate for even average use, so plan on buying a 256 card at the same time. Those planning to take a large number of pictures or movies within a short period of time should consider getting a spare battery as well; because the battery charges outside of the camera, you can pocket a fully charged spare to take with you, or you can be charging one battery while the other is in use.<br /><br />Especially for those buying their first digital camera, shooting photos with this camera can be slightly disconcerting at first since the user must depress the shutter button halfway to lock in to focus, then the rest of the way to shoot. The impulse is to press down harder to take the photo, which can result in a blurry picture. Taking pictures with a digital camera simply is not as instantaneous as with a 35 mm camera. Once the transition is made, however, the quality is superb. Red-eye is a huge problem with the flash, so users should remind themselves to switch to that mode when taking photos of people inside.<br /><br />The Olympus Stylus 500 is a compact, versatile camera designed for people who shoot primarily snapshots. Its size and weather-proof case make it perfect for vacations as well as for everyday use.","This is my first digital camera, and it is so easy to use.  There are only a few buttons to figure out, and it takes great pictures - they are clear and the color is great.  The large screen allows you to get a good idea of the photo, so you can delete it right away if it's not a keeper.  Great camera for any skill level.","After trying the Fuji FinePix, which was a nightmare, I am loving this camera.  I owned an Olympus before (35mm) and it lasted almost 20 years.  I hope to see the same return on this camera.  Good battery life and large display screen are the biggest pluses for me and my needs.  I basically take pictures of my kids.  The only complaint I have is that the manual that comes with the camers is very basic and to get the more detailed manual, you have to download and print it.  I wish it came with the camera.","The old point-and-shoot camera I'd had for years finally stopped working (got some sand in it at the beach), and I took the plunge into digital with this Olympus camera. I bought it specifically to take on a cycling trip through Tuscany, and I was not disappointed. The camera is small enough to tuck in the back of a biking jersey, takes GREAT pictures, is very easy to use, and is durable as anything. I took it cycling, to the beach, used it in the mountains, and it has given me nothing but terrific photos, and no user problems whatsoever.<br /><br />The one suggestion I would make if you buy this camera, to forego the suggested leather case accessory. I bought a padded nylon camera case at my local Ritz camera (about $12) which worked much better, as it had pockets for extra memory and a spare battery as well as a sturdy shoulder strap. (I agree with the previous reviewer that, even though the battery life is exceptional, an extra battery is a good idea to have if you don't want any \"down time\" with your camera at all.)","I got this camera mainly because of the megapixels, screen size, the fact that you can see the screen from many angles other than just looking at it straight on, and the post-editing features on the camera itself. At first I was \"iffy\" because I had the Stylus Verve for a short time when it first came out and the pictures came out terrible. I was told by an Olympus customer service rep that the Stylus line is mainly for use outdoors, hence the weather-proof design. But I believed that this one would be better given that it was newer so I decided to give it a shot. I was pretty happy with the results at first but the more I used it the more I realized the things I didn't like about it, but let me say that most of my use with the camera has been indoors. The way the lighting appears on the screen isn't always the way the picture will turn out. Like many other digital cameras like this one, it doesn't do well in low-light settings. Many times it looks like there's enough light on the screen to take a good picture but then it comes out really dark. There are times it will come out okay. Large group pictures do not come out clear at all. Even though the camera is able to focus when taking the picture, faces will turn out quite blurry. Other than that, however, pictures in a good range & lighting come out fine. Another thing, I owned a Minolta Dimage G400 (4mp) before I got my Olympus. It was very fast in all aspects and it took great pictures, even when it wasn't able to focus in low-light. The Olympus has a pretty good start-up time but doesn't compare to my previous camera. The recharging of the flash takes too long in my opinion. I went to a graduation and took one picture of my fiance at one end of the stage and the flash wasn't ready until he had already crossed to the other end, so I missed so many important and great pictures! I always have issues with the time it takes for the flash to recharge when I'm trying to take multiple in-the-moment pictures. I'd have to say that's my biggest complaint about this camera. It really does make me mad at times. The Olympus isn't a bad camera but maybe it just doesn't suit what I've been using it for. The outdoor pictures I have taken with it have turned out fine. I just think that for what I paid for it ($350), it should still be a good camera indoors as well as outdoors. I wish I never got rid of my Minolta. By far it was a better camera. I really had no complaints about it as far as performance and picture quality.","This camera was purchased for my wife as a simple point'n'shoot.  That's what she did.  300 pictures in two days.  It took a little experimenting to figure out what the \"scenes\" do, but any \"mistakes\" are quickly erased.  Quick and easy review are two of the highlights...the screen is huge and very bright (comparing to my G6), so one can really review the results and make decisions.<br /><br />There are only a few manual settings, e.g. white balance, and those are all that's needed for a camera like this.  Auto settings and \"scenes\" work fine for almost everything. The \"weather resistant\" aspect is also a big plus.  No fear of getting caught in the rain and more importantly, missing those great reflection shots when it's still drizzling.<br /><br />I've given it a 4/5 only because the quality of the pictures could be just a little sharper.  I'm used to the results of higher end Canon cameras, so I might be biased.  By the same token, I'm using this more than my Canon simply because I can slip it into a pocket no matter where we go.  Great little camera!","I've used this camera for over a month now. In general, I like it and recommend it. It's all-weather, so you don't have to worry about taking shots in the rain. It has a handy, built-in lens cover that pops open lightning fast when you turn the camera on;  start-up time is very short compared to every other camera I've used, so you miss fewer shots when you suddenly need to take a picture. The camera is also smaller than it looks in the online photos I saw of it (I bought it sight-unseen from Amazon), yet comfortable to hold. The large LCD is also nice, though I would prefer a viewfinder alternative. It doesn't have full manual settings, but I am fine with that. I've never used the full manual settings on any camera.<br /><br />My complaints are few: it doesn't to well in low-light-level situations, such as museums, or in the evening. People look very yellow and orangish compared to a larger-aperture digital camera such as the Olympus C740 (which I also own and love). It also has the drawback that you need to remove the battery and put it in the charger instead of using the camera as a charger. The battery does last a long time, however, and the charger accepts worldwide power 100-240V, 50-60 cycles (though you need a small adaptor plug wherever you go, just not a voltage converter).<br /><br />----------<br />Here I edit my original review to remove my complaint that the camera never remembers any settings. That issue can be overcome by changing the \"All Reset\" setting to Off in the camera's mode settings menu. Thanks to the Amazon customer who sent me that message!<br />----------<br /><br />My wife and I have taken some great photos with it, and I recommend the camera, but be aware of the above flaws before you decide.<br /><br />It comes with a 32MB xD card, but you will need a larger one. Expect close to 1MB per photo. Therefore, a 512MB xD card will hold about 500 photos.","Great digital camera, I bought it for it size. I already owned an Olympus C700 Ultra Zoom and wanted a compact camera for travel, this one is perfect. Great size and the weather proof is a nice touch. Also uses the same XD  memory card as other Olympus cameras. You may want to buy an extra battery because it does not use regular AA, only a rechargeable.","I love this little digital camera.

Although you can start taking snapshots without reading the manual and navigating the menu, the camera offers a selection of scene options such as color enhancement for still life, shoot and select for moving objects, landscape and portrait shots for crispness in both foreground and background, a sport setting to capture action without blurring, beach and snow setting for to minimize glare, a selection for taking pictures of objects behind glass, and many other options.  These scene features work well, and they deliver exactly what they are supposed to.  This palm-size camera also records digital home movies, with audio, that you can play back either on your television screen or through your PC software such as iMovies.<br /><br />The camera comes with a high-speed USB cable to transfer photos directly to the computer without intermediate hardware, an audio/video cables to hook up for film clip viewing, a semi-rigid black case, CD-ROMs for the software and user manual, and a 32 MB picture card.  The photo transfer works on both Macs and PCs.  The included software, Olympus Master, is adequate for photo management, although I prefer iPhoto.  Adobe Photoshop would be even better for those who like to manipulate photos, though this kind of high-tech software is hardly necessary.  You can also print directly off the camera if you choose to bypass your PC.  The 32 MB XD picture card that comes with the camera is woefully inadequate for even average use, so plan on buying a 256 card at the same time.  Those planning to take a large number of pictures or movies within a short period of time should consider getting a spare battery as well; because the battery charges outside of the camera, you can pocket a fully charged spare to take with you, or you can be charging one battery while the other is in use.<br /><br />Especially for those buying their first digital camera, shooting photos with this camera can be slightly disconcerting at first since the user must depress the shutter button halfway to lock in to focus, then the rest of the way to shoot.  The impulse is to press down harder to take the photo, which can result in a blurry picture.  Taking pictures with a digital camera simply is not as instantaneous as with a 35 mm camera.  Once the transition is made, however, the quality is superb.  Red-eye is a huge problem with the flash, so users should remind themselves to switch to that mode when taking photos of people inside.<br /><br />The Olympus Stylus 500 is a compact, versatile camera designed for people who shoot primarily snapshots.  Its size and weather-proof case make it perfect for vacations as well as for everyday use.","I love this camera so much.  Two months after buying it I bought one for my mom.  I never take out my video camera anymore!  I keep the camera with me in my diaper bag and snap pictures and video all the time.<br /><br />LOVE the large screen!<br /><br />LOVE the ease of use!<br /><br />LOVE the rechargeable battery- I take hundreds of pictures and only charge the battery about once a month or less.<br /><br />I DEFINITELY recommend this camera!","I researched a long time, was set to buy another camera, then went in to test it out and found out the shutter speed was excruciatingly slow.  This camera, however, is great.  I bought it mostly because of the shutter speed (and the 3x X 4x zoom), but everything about it is great.  The menus take a little bit of getting used to--I keep hitting the \"menu\" button to select options, which isn't necessary--but it's hardly a complaint to say the options are more streamlined than usual.<br /><br />The only real problem I've had is that the hinged cover for the battery and memory card is right where my thumb usually is, so more than once I've accidentally opened it (it opens quite easily).  But this isn't really a big enough problem to be a big purchase decision breaker.<br /><br />I've only had the camera two weeks, so I haven't made any prints yet, but the color is great and the pictures look wonderful online.  I highly, highly recommend this camera.","This is my first Olympus digital and I absolutely love it. My aunt has it and she is very picky about her cameras so I knew I could trust her recomendation. I figured everything out very quickly and every shot has been perfect. We have a 512mb card and it will allow you to take up to 25 minutes of video. We did a short 20 second clip  and emailed it using the Olympus software. It was so easy and easily viewed by family on the other end. And the screen is awesome. Its nice not to not look so close at the screen anymore. I love being able to hit the quick view button to flip and delete through pictures while keeping it in photo mode and then hitting it again to resume taking pictures. So much easier then turning the dial everytime (although that is still an option).  The only thing that I have learned my lesson on with this camera, is when when you have the USB cable connecting it to your computer, Disconnect it as soon as your transfer is done. I did my transfer and then left it connected all afternoon. When I went to turn it on the battery was dead. Even though the screen was not on it still drained. So as long as you don't leave it hooked up to your computer then everything is great. You won't regret this camera.<br /><br />P.S. the cuisine mode is awesome","I've had good experiences with Olympus in the past, so I picked up this camera when I wanted to get into the 5 MP range.  This is an outstanding value.  The LCD screen is like none other I have ever seen.  It is huge.  I loved it when I first saw it, and I didn't realize until after I got the camera home that it doesn't have a normal viewfinder at all.  The only way to take a picture is with the LCD screen on.  That alarmed me because I worred about battery life, but the battery life has turned out to be very long.  I've used the camera on many occasions without having the charge the battery.  It's long lasting and reliable.<br /><br />I like that I can charge the battery outside the camera, so I bought an extra battery and always keep my spare one charged up.  Some other camera have to be charged with the battery inside, which makes keeping a spare harder.<br /><br />This is super-light and small.  It can be tucked into my purse and it takes up hardly any space at all.  I adore the size.<br /><br />One good test of a camera is how easily people unfamiliar with it can take pictures.  I know that I never read the manual.  It was immediately obvious how to take pictures or movies or review the old pictures, and other people have picked up on the use of this camera instantly, too.  The on screen menus are informative and easy to follow without a manual.  There are no obscure codes or symbols to decipher.<br /><br />In the higher-end camera segment, this 5 MP with a sleek design is an exceptional buy.  Highly recommended.","I did a lot of research before purchasing this camera.  I was looking for a 5MP, compact size, with a large LCD screen, and lots of built in settings.  This camera checked off on all with flying colors.  The 20 preset modes are easy to navigate thru and give good descriptions of what each one is used for.  As with many digital cameras, the indoor shooting can be a bit tricky to get just right.  The flash on the auto setting is a bit strong (still not sure if I can adjust that yet). Outdoor shots are incredible! My favorite feature is the 2.5 LCD screen.  There is no view finder, but the screen is more than adequate even in bright sunlight.  The Stylus 500 is also weather proof which puts your mind at ease if there is a light drizzle coming down or you want to take it with you skiing (which I have done).  If you are like me and love all the bells and whistles, this camera has plenty to offer. If you need an easy point and shoot, it can do that too. Overall this camera is fantastic. I hightly recommend it.","This 5.0 MP digital camera is so advanced, it's simple.  That's usually a contradiction in the camera market, but Olympus has come up with a definite winner with this offering.  Read the reviews and you'll come up with the conclusion that this camera offers a lot for the money, even though you'll probably not use 80 percent of the features.  No problem, because the user friendliness of this camera makes it difficult to take bad photos/moving pictures in the \"auto\" modes.  I purchased this camera to replace my Olympus C-5050 (internal battery died and memory feature lost).  Because I had several xD cards already invested, my choice was basically limited to Fuji and Olympus.  I was also looking for a smaller/lighter camera that is easier to use and has minimal shutter lag (this camera is super quick in all that it does, including shutter lag).<br /><br />I'm very satisfied with this camera and although I have not used the Canon's, Sony's, Fuji's, HP's, etc., comparative reviews have stated that the picture quality (accuracy and natural tone/colors) of this specific Olympus digital camera is very good.  Study for yourself via the internet and you should not be too disappointed with the findings and its value for the money (or your purchase).","I first bought the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T1 and was very unhappy with it.  The pictures were dark and the red eye was terrible.  I exchanged it for the Stylus 500 and after using it for a couple of weeks I am thrilled with this camera.  It takes great pictures, it's pretty quick and is very easy to use.  Also, compared to the Sony the 2.5 LCD is MUCH clearer. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants high quality images and an easy to use camera."]},{"name":"Epson PhotoPC L-500V","amazon_reviews":["I've never left a review for anything I've bought before, but I feel compelled to do so for this camera.

This is a great, albeit outdated camera. The price was great and it came with a full array of accessories. The door for the film card didn't work but was quickly fixed with a bit of velcro and some superglue. I have taken hundreds of pictures with this camera since it arrived. I am very happy with it.","I was disappointed that the camera does not takes clear, crisp photos everytime. I like the camera, but the unprectibility is frustrating. Will return and try another series of Olympus.","Great!","Why am I now bothering to write a review of a camera that's 5 or 6 years old?  Because it's a true classic (like the Oly E-10) and worthy of the effort.  I love cameras.  I have a fair number.  I started out as a kid and have always loved photography.  Loved 35mm, had my own darkroom (b/w and later color) for many years.  Moved in to digital when they first appeard and never looked back.  So I have a fair amount of experience with photo gear.  Over the years, some gear stands out.  The E-10 was one such camera (I ran the E10pro.com web site for many years I loved the E-10 so much).  The E-300 is another.  (In general, I am a big Olympus fan.  I love their designs, lenses (some of the best ever made), and the value for the price.  Canon and Nikon are great, but if you don't mind walking a different path, Oly gear is a fabulous value proposition.)<br /><br />There are already many fine reviews posted here.  I won't repeat all the details.  I'll just add that the E-300 is a real classic design.  Very different in style from the standard SLR's everyone else made/makes.  The E-300 is unusual and many E-300 owners are captivated by that difference.  It's a delight to use the E-300 if you appreciate the functional form and what it gives you.  Some don't like it, of course, but many of us love it.  It's a pleasure to use a camera this well engineered and with a cool, offbeat design.  And, of course, it takes great pictures!<br /><br />Even today, it will hold its own.  Many of the newer models have better specs and may even be, arguably, better cameras.  But there's something special about the E-300.  Enough so that I bought a couple of extra E-300 bodies last year when I found them cheap, just in case.  ;)<br /><br />The sensor used is a gem, the colors are a treat, and 8 megapixels is more than enough for most anything.  The E-300 can use the great Oly lenses, of course, and is a great match for the Oly legacy film (OM)lenses as well (with an adapter, straight manual focus, so much fun!).  It's big and bulky to some, but I love it.  It fits my hands well.  It's truly built like a tank and mine will probably outlast me.  Go to dpreview.com and read the threads on the E-300 and you will get a good idea of what a superb camera this really is.<br /><br />If you look at what you might pay for an E-300 body today, and compare what you get with what else you might buy, for the same price, you will soon realize what a treasure this could be.  So if you have stumbled upon this camera, somehow, and are wondering about it.  Then you now know why I took the time to post this review. ;)","Fantastic camera. I've been able to take some great shots with this baby and have had no problems. I'm using PNY Optima Pro 2GB CompactFlash 133X (20MB/Sec Read/Wrte Speed) Flash Memory Card P-CF2GB-133W-DVDC for memory (About 950 pics on HQ) and my time between shots is less than a sec. I don't even notice anytime between shots really.

Battery last really long I've been taking between 300-600 shots a day on the one battery and still had tons of juice left. [...] Ease of use is great with only a small learning curve. I highly recommend looking at Olympus when it come time to buy a DSLR and the E-300 is def a fav of mine.","I was very exctied to receive this item, as it was a valentines day gift for my wife, until she tried to use it, so far its been in twice for repair for the same problem, the lenses will not focus.

In the last year and a half it has served me very well. I have taken 7500 pictures and the camera is going strong!

I shoot mostly wildlife and landscape photograpy and both my Zuiko 14-45mm and 40-150mm lenses see plenty of action.  The 14-45 is a great all purpose lense that doubles both as a semi-wide angle and a short Telescopic lens.  The 40-150 is a short tele that performs as it is supposed to.<br /><br />Picture quality is the best I have had yet out of a camera.  This is my third olympus camera for this reason alone because in the long run this is what matters most.<br /><br />I compared this to the equivalent Canon, Nikon and Minolta Cameras and am glad i make this choice.  The lens kit is superior, the battery life is nearly eternal (I have taken approx 3000 shots and recharged the battery only 3 times), and the camera is very durable.<br /><br />Olympus also upgraded its software package that has been greatly improved from their previous software.<br /><br />All in all, this is a steal for the price, especially since the E330 is now on the market.","I love this camera, it photographs great, it has great lenses. Now the great thing about this camera is that you can pick the types of photographic scenes you'll be taking in automatic setup or you can customize scene exposures and other photography features like in the oldschool 35mm cameras did such as so you can get streak in lights and other effects that the old film cameras were able to do. The pictures come out superbly.<br /><br />The only negetive I have to say is, the manual could use a little improvement and their is a sound when you photograph that's it. If you can live with those two faults, then its an awesome camera to get.<br /><br />Merry x-mas","I'm a photographer, i have this camera and a Rebel XT by Canon, Before switching to digital from film i did my research, i've always used PC World Magazine as my bible for purchasing any type of computer euipment, cameras or software. when i read their review of the Olumpus E300 i was impressed. so i purchased one. Again they have not let me down. Its easy to use, The photos are crisp and clear and the feel of the camera makes you aware that your holding a camera not a toy. theres one review here that bothers me, its almost as if someone from Olumpus's competetion. Neverthe less for the price this camera stands up to any of the competetion. i've compared it to my canon and my best friends Nikon d70..if your looking for an inexpensive but great quality camera..check this one out..","Being my first SLR, this camera is one heck of a good investment! Now I know why so many people talks about the difference, that robust-feeling of holding a well-made SLR compared to even the most expensive point-and-shoot cameras.<br /><br />With all the reviews here a lot has been said already about this camera. I'd add to those by pointing out one of my favorite feature of this camera: 8 Mpixels!<br /><br />A lot of people say that 8 MP is not a biggie compared to the 6 MP of the other more famous (pricier) SLR's, but it really helps me to hone my composition skills.  How? I just took the pictures and later I  study which part of the picture is better so I can learn to compose better for my future shots.  If you have only 6 MP to play with, you don't have many leeways in cropping, but with 8 MP, you can do a lot of what-if crops.<br /><br />Of course, I also have to affirm most of the reviews here that Olympus  is as good as and in cases, superior to those big-names SLR's in the only term that matters to me: image quality.<br /><br />Oh, for reference, I shoot natural landscapes, flowers, and of course, my toddler :)","There are fine reviews already written about this product. All of them are true from my experience. This is simply a great product and a great price.<br /><br />A strong body, amazing picture quality, very less delay in transferring images to the storage. The leses come with the camera is good enough for most of the cases.<br /><br />There is a lot to learn, which is same in most of the SLR cameras. But this camera gives several pre programmed options which is good for starters.<br /><br />I had difficulty taking portraints indoor. That may be the only thing which worries me. But I found this is common in many cameras. It requires appropritae lighting.<br /><br />Also do not buy this camers to take indoor (birthday, parties etc..) photography. Use point and shoot cameras for that.... But outdoor, this one is truly a great camera.","What I liked about this camera is that it is fairly easy to use and has several good options, such as candle lighting, which can make for some nice low-light photos with warmer tones. If you are not a fan of the washed-out flourescent or flash bulb lighting, you might like this feature. Outdoor photos were crisp and rendered fairly accurate colors. What I did not like about the camera, though, is that the autofocus on the zoom lens is horribly slow, making it almost impossible to use in rooms that are not well lit. The regular lens is not great with this either. In low-light there is a significant amount noise, and the flash is not very powerful, so I would recommend buying a seperate one. Also, in the white areas of several photos the camera placed white dots on the brightest spots, such as the whites of eyes and teeth. This was very annoying and time- consuming to correct in photoshop. The last feature I did not like is the bulky design and weight of the camera. This is definitely not a camera to travel with.","This is a fantastic camera, especially for the money.  I've just been getting into photography recently, and I don't regret shelling out the money that I have.  It is the best priced 8mp digital slr you can find.","This is a great camera for someone who is getting used to a dSLR.  It has a ton of features and excellent image quality without having to spend lots of money.  I have bought several accessories and have been very happy with the quality of Olympus.  I have taken many great pictures and got rid of my old canon after this.","Before buying the Evolt 300, I read numerous reviews on it and  D-SLR cameras from Nikon, Canon, Sigma and Fujifilm with similar features.<br /><br />Bottom line consensus:  The Evolt 300 is a technically sound and accomplished D-SLR which delivers quality photographs comparable to the Nikon D70 and superior to the Canon Digital Rebel XT.<br /><br />So far, so good.<br /><br />I then visited various dealers--from dedicated photoshops to Best Buy and Circut City--so that I could see and handle each of the cameras in my price / feature range: ~$800 to ~$1400, 6+ megapixels, decent selection of lenses.  (I purchased the camera @ Adorama Camera via Amazon).<br /><br />Unlike the similarly priced Nikon D50 and the Canon XT, the Evolt 300 does not feel or handle like a cheap plastic toy.  Score 1.  if I'm spending a considerable amount of money on a D-SLR, I want a certain degree of ruggedness.  This is a well-made camera.<br /><br />I narrowed my choices down to the Nikon D70, the Evolt 300 and the Canon EOS 20D.  If money were no object, I'd say buy the Canon EOS 20D.<br /><br />Likewise, the Nikon D70 makes good sense if you have compatible Nikon lenses.  But otherwise it simply doesn't outperform the Evolt 300 to justify the cost difference.<br /><br />I went with the Evolt 300 with the dual Zuiko lenses. (The package listed above).  Even with the  FL-36 Flash and extra battery, I still kept the entire package price under $1000.<br /><br />I've been using the camera consistently for the past two months since relocating to Senegal.  No problems.<br /><br />If I can take the word of others, the photos --not in terms of art but image quality-- are outstanding.<br /><br />I generally shot in RAW and can go through 4+ gigs before worrying about the battery.  To date, I've used most of the programmable features--including autobracketing for exposure and white balance.  All work as advertised.  Likewise, the different scence modes also very good.  (One exception noted below).<br /><br />Three compliants, the last minor.<br /><br />1.  Although this camera does allow both manual focus and auto focus with manual fine-tuning, the Zuiko lenses simply don't respond well to manual focus.  For certain  macro shots (those with tricky backgrounds), you have play around a good bit just to get the subject in focus.  Dialing to manual and handtuning -- which should solve the problem-- almost a waste of time.<br /><br />2.  Olympus has it's own version of RAW-- .orf.  ORF requires a plugin for Photoshop 7 and lower (I don't know about Photoshp CS).  Although RAW offers great editing options, the ORF version is a pain to work with, loads much slower, and can't be previewed except by using Olympus Master software.  Given the amount of photos I shot, ORF has added hours of processing time over what the standard RAW files would.  This I'm less than thrilled with.<br /><br />3.  You'll either love or hate the sunset mode.  I really don't care for the way it turns the horizon Martian orange.  I want the deep blues, reds and purples that I see -- and not bad postcard melodrama.  When I now shoot sunsets or oceanscapes at dusk, I do so NOT using the sunset mode.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />No regrets whatsoever about this purchase.  I am very happy with my Evolt 300 which has already seen a great deal of use under less than ideal conditions.  The camera is technically solid, easy-to-use, and comes with many strong basic and advanced features.  Just excellent value for price.  So far, great fun too.","New to the digital SLR world, even a novice like me has figured out what all the little buttons & doo-dads are for.  I have uploaded our pictures from our vacation & was amazed at the quality and how beautiful they came out. The little screen on the camera has great quality & detail for the size.  Can't wait to become a pro with this little pint-sized powerhouse!","The E-300 is so intuitive and easy to use.  Physically it feels so much better than the Rebel or the comparative Nikon.  The rubber-coated aluminum chasis and smooth-working controls make it hard to put down.  I recommend buying several 1Gig cards for it though.  This weekend I took some autumn portraits of my cousin and his wife at the park.  Using .tif and no compression, I only got 34 pics!  I had to field delete some.  I love it.  I am planning the next session already.","This is a solid camera. Feels great in the hands and takes pretty pictures. The viewfinder is a little dim and focusing can be tricky at times with the included lenses. The menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are layed out very well. It is a good camera for novice and pros alike.","i did lots of researching, internet and stores, on most of the novice friendly slrs's out there. i really wanted the canon rebel xt because it's the lightest one out there and pretty sharp looking. when i was unwilling to pay the price i took a serious look at the olympus e300. it's not as pretty as the rebel but there are still many reasons to love this camera! i actually like that it looks like the cameras of yester-year! kind of clunky but has all the great new digital features we're all yearning for now. i love that it can be completely manual, totally automatic and anywhere in between. i love the fact that you can buy just the body, the body with one lens or the body with 2 lenses. it's always been a pain even with the 35mm's that you have to get each component like the filters and flash but we should all be used to that by now! i've only owned the camera for a couple of weeks so i haven't yet explored all the possiblities but just tinkering with it i have taken some pretty good shots. it's a pretty cool camera.<br /><br />ps - batteries, flashes, oem cases can all be checked out at e-bay. i got some pretty good deals on the accessories.","Just purchased an Olympus E300 Evolt camra.  I was a faithful customer of the Plympus for many yers.  Own large professional digital camera produced by Olympus in cooperation with Optronix, owned E-10 and E-20, besides working professionally on Olympus microscopes.  I was always very happy and satisfied with quality and reliability of Olympus products, that's why I am still in schock that E-300 Evolt was such a disappointment.  In fact, it was more like a slap on the face when I opened a bag, pulled out a camera and read a reasonably large tag \"Made in China\".  Sorry, Olympus, but you just lost a very faithful customer.  I am not going to rely on Chinese-manufactured camera in the remote parts of the world and extreme conditions, where I took most of many thousands of my photos.  Yes, it is a fast camera and the quality is adequate when you use ISO 100 to 400.  When it comes up to 800 or 1600 it is virtually unusable.  The noise pixels become annoyingly obvious and ruin the image.  I hope, OLympus that you will come up with better product in Evolt E500, but, PLEASE, make and assemble it in Japan......","Excellent camera. Easy to learn and operate. Excellent picture quality. Purchased the Olympus name because of previous experience with Olympus cameras (OM10 SLR)and was not disappointed.","It has been about 2 weeks that I have received my camera. I am a novice, this camera takes great pictures,very easy to use, it is built very tough and feels great holding it. I will highly recommend it.","I had a C-3000Z Oly, good pictures and durability, but slow and you can find only 128M Smart Media Card in the market, no more, then I decided to change: Canon?, Nikon?, Konica? mmmm Olympus!<br />This is my first Digital SLR Camera,so I`m studying this product and benefits, in the future, I`ll have a concrete opinion about this, but is there a small, thin and lite SLR Digital Camera like the SP-350 and SP-500 UZ Oly ??<br />If you want to know about E300 Oly \"in lab and test\" visit:<br />[...]","As a long time Olympus I'm very pleased with the company's digital SLR. I own OM1, OM2 and OM4T film SLRs, but the E300 is going to cause all of these cameras to gather dust. The feel of the camera is solid, the turn on time is almost instantaneous and the focusing is lightning fast. The photos I've taken so far have been excelent in detaila nd color accuracy. I've blown one shot up to poster size with no problems.<br /><br />The downloading software is nothing special, but get a card reader and don't even be bothered with the software driven downloads.<br /><br />I recomend the E300 to anyone that is serious about their equipment and wants accurate and highly detailed photos. It's a steal at the current price.","They were sending out the OM system adapter (so you can use your existing OM lenses with this camera) since the release of the digital system, upon request (for free). After waiting a week for mine they called and left a message that said this adapter isn't available and will not be made any more. They said I would have to find a (non-existant as far as I know) 3rd party adapter to do the job. So I am just out of luck.<br /><br />The customer service is extremely disappointing. I choose this camera because of this OM compatibility, since I have cameras, lenses, and accessories that I acquired over the past 30 years for that system. If I wanted to start over I would probably go with the Canon, since they have a longer track record on AF and digital cameras, plenty of available used equipment, and more 3rd party support.<br /><br />The camera itself is nice if you don't care about the lens compatibility. I have not compared it to Canon or Nikon so I can't say which is better... but the design of the Olympus is very good. You can easily control exposure and the like without using menus at all.<br /><br />I would give the camera itself 5 stars and the company 0 stars for boneheaded decisions that are not in their best interest.","While I wouldn't consider the E-300 a direct competitor to the EOS20 (much more expensive)its performance is a little behind the REBELXT in some aspects (burst capacity & images@ISO800+) IT IS ALSO HUNDRED$ LESS.<br /><br />For most uses, this camera provides essentially the same performance as its pricier competitors!<br /><br />I recently upgraded to the E-300 from the C-8080WZ (an incredible/versatile workhorse)and have been quite impressed with the nicer features present in the E-300.<br /><br />Major noticeable differences between the C-8080 and E-300: Zoom control(mechanical ring)!!, Shutter Release speed, speedier autofocus,  CF write speed!!!, speed in working with RAW files, 10+ excellent preset scene shooting modes (Sunset, Night, Fireworks, Beach/snow,...) to help even a beginner produce great looking images.<br /><br />In short, this is a great camera for the money (~$800) but if you are really picky or you want lots of high ISO shots you'd be happier spending $200 more for a bit nicer camera.","This is the latest in my journey through Olympus Digital Cameras<br /><br />(D340R, 460,560,2020z, 5060 -- some of which I have reviewed on Amazon). The choice of the E-300, used for some commerical work I do, was not so easy because I have a bag full of Pentax K lenses and was mightily tempted by the Pentax digitals. But, having batteries, familiarity with the menu system, and really very good experience with Olympus products and service over the years, I took the plunge and got the E-300 and its kit lens. Then got a K mount adapter for my Pentax lenses and set to work.<br /><br />Ok, there are some quirks and I will get them out of the way:<br /><br />- a slight magenta cast to some greens, easily fixed in post-processing or fiddling with WB, and the noise reduction system can just slightly dull grass in photos, also easily fixed<br /><br />- now and then a bright spot will fool exposure slightly when using the full screen sensor (I've learned to use the center-weighted and spot meters to take care of this)<br /><br />- I am not overly impressed by the lcd, which doesn't seem to have the brilliance of the one on my 5060.<br /><br />- I wish Oly had added an xD slot for those of us with a collection of these cards, purchased for use with older models<br /><br />Now to some good stuff:<br /><br />- don't worry about some reviews claiming the camera is noisey and doesn't like 800/1600 ISO. I get fine results, which are easily fine tuned in Photoshop Elements, Neat Image or other programs, and which can be helped mightily by using a wide aperture prime lens at 400.<br /><br />- colors are brilliant and resolution sharp<br /><br />- the Oly jpg algorithms are very good, meaning that for most 'normal' shooting one can be perfectly happy using the best HQ mode -- lots of testing on my part discerns very little visible difference with SHQ. This is good to know when traveling or when you want to keep some disc space; triage carefully when you see that once in a lifetime shot coming and then use the highest modes<br /><br />- Raw is very good but by all means avoid the Olympus Master converter, which is terribly unintuitive, in favor of Adobe's.<br /><br />- battery life is excellent with the BLM1 battery (and yes, you can get good backups on that auction site for less than ten dollars each; and they work just fine); I've only run one battery down all the way and that was with multiple in camera editing and a download of 150 shots via USB.<br /><br />- flash is fine (though watch lens hood shadowing at highest aperture); I've supplemented with the FL-36 and FL-20, both of which work flawlessly, even for the brain dead like me. Like many cameras this one will occasionally underexpose so I generally program the flash for a little extra oomph.<br /><br />- the camera feels rugged and well made; a little tank that feels good in one's hand and thanks to lack of prism on top slides easily into a small bag.<br /><br />- the kit lens is really quite fine<br /><br />- K lenses, including a Tokina ATX telephoto zoom work easily and brilliantly, as does an OM lens with adapter.<br /><br />-even for the 'advanced' among us, it is good to have the range of scene modes on this camera. They work.<br /><br />-vastly improved instruction manual.<br /><br />-burns very quickly, even to standard CF cards.<br /><br />-finally, this thing really keeps dust off the sensor. I'm constantly fiddling between lenses in very different environmental situations and have yet to see a spec. Yes, some appear on the outer mirror, but that is easily and harmlessly cured.<br /><br />Olympus does not have the cache or marketing power of Nikon and Canon. And the sensor on this 4/3d's camera is smaller than those on its main competitors. Yet, I find it to be a solid and<br /><br />unflashly product in line with most Oly cameras I have owned. This company is good at miniaturization, glass, and compression algorithms. If you need it Oly service is excellent (quick and friendly as I found out when I screwed up something in my 5060, also a superb camera).<br /><br />I'm sure that there are fine photos to be had with any of the major dslr's on the market and not having a lot of comparative experience with other brands probably don't know what I am missing. But if you want an elegant workhorse with high resolution and brilliant photos give this one a careful look.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />I just thought I would provide an update for anyone who runs across one of these now ancient cameras. The bottom line is that though I have two other Oly dslr's (E-510m, and E-330) I continue to have serious attachment to this camera, which is now my 'car camera' sitting in a bag through heat and cold, with a set of 'backup' lenses. With some tweaking of the camera's color settings --slight increases in contrast and saturation -- the colors are amazing, the best I think of any of my cameras. There's just something about the sensor. My favorite combo is the camera and the very small and light Oly 14-42. It focuses quickly and accurately, and just feels great in the hand. Of course, some caveats. No image stabilization. Don't get too serious above ISO 400. But sometimes we get too, too spoiled by the latest and greatest. This isn't one of those cameras, but it keeps one thinking seriously about photography, reminds me that for generations pros used cameras much more simple than this to create great images.","I'll make this very short.  I really like this camera and everyone here posts many positive features so I am only going to feature the few drawbacks.  I think that it should come with a faster lens, at least f/2.5, I mean come on how are you going to use the 1/4000 sec. with this lens.  Coming out of sleep mode is not instant!  I expected it to be and I missed a shot because of it.  Whatever happened to the hour long shutter speeds?  I get a max. of 8 minutes on BULB - meaning I have to hold the button down, 30 sec. by itself.  Plugging the camera in through the USB corrupted images on my disk - maybe a problem with my camera only. Also the whole 800 1600 ISO thing, but who cares...<br /><br />Pros-<br /><br />No need for a Macro lens, with 8MP you can get as close as you want.  Excellent program mode.  As a matter of fact, all pre-programmed exposures are excellent.  Battery life 550+ pics with around 60% flash use.  Auto-white balance is of superior quality.  2.5 fps seems slow at first when compared to the 8 fps of other cameras, but in the field, it's plenty.<br /><br />Additional batteries are cheap - buy from a British dealer on eBay for around 9 GBP or $16 including shipping.  I got my camera on eBay for $645 brand new in box with warranty cards.  Also purchased a hotshoe to PC-sync adapter for around 15 AUD or $11 including shipping.  Also a step up ring adapter to use my 67mm filters on this camera with 58mm lenses.<br /><br />These few drawbacks are not enough to keep you from saving $800-900 off of the Canon 20D for the same image quality!","Well, where does one start?  Ok, I am for the record not a professional.  I have been shooting photos for some 45 years however.  I have in the past had a Kodak Retina ( still do with every attachment ever made for the camera in mint condition), a Nikon F1, Cannon AE1, Olympus OM1.  I  always enjoyed existing light and time exposures, and have even won some small awards and have been published in the past ( nothing really all that noteworthy).  When I shot tons of 35 mm film I enjoyed special effects using various filters, slow shutter for motion ( pan motorcycles, race cars, action sport sceens etc).  A few years ago I stopped shooting 35mm as my first choice and entered the digital age.  Mainly for the simplicity.  I bought a hot ( for the time ) Nikon 990.  Problem was, battery life and while the photos were ok it was just a point and shoot camera, all creativity was gone.<br /><br /> Now comes the Olympus Evotl E-300!  I looked at the Cannon 20D, and the Nikon D70, and even the Sony DSC F828, (I did not like looking through a small TV screen on the F828).  The Olympus won me over with  some neat features on the E-300 that I really liked.  First the size, and feel.  It is  compact while at the same time has the look and feel of a \"real\" camera. It's so easy to use that I bought it one day, and that night went down town to see what it would do in my old love that I had missed - existing light.  Wow, is all I can say.  I got shots I would have had problems with a high grade 35 mm.  I used the \"scenes\" function and found it to be right on the money with each shot.  Before sunset I got a chance to use the \"portrait\" scene function and got fantastic results.  The back ground was in fact slightly out of focus just as I would have wanted by using the depth of field on my old 35 mm cameras.  I switched the camera to fully manual and took a number of night shots,  all came out fine.  I found that I could hold the camera for some very long exposires by hand ( 1 sec or more).  I think this may be due to the fit and feel of the camera. She just fits in your hand and holding steady is not a problem.  Also all the controls are right there and easy to figure out.  Please note that I bought the camera, and that night was using the darn thing in near total darkness. I did not have time to read and study the manual.  It's simply that easy to use.  The format of the information is simple and well placed on the camera for easy use.<br /><br /> The second day ( I still have not charged the battery) I took a trip around Guam. (Here for business.)  There are some really gorgeous scenes on Guam if you know where to look.  Beach scenes, palm trees, large green rolling hills and a multitude of other neat items like old WWII relics in the jungle came out crisp and clear.  I use the B/W function and at the same time upped the saturation and contrast for some very interesting back lit dramatic subjects.  I left the contrast and saturation on high for some very blue skies and some very white clouds., the prints  came out looking like post cards! The shore line shots came out well with this combination as well.  Then at sunset I had to try the \"sunset\" function.  I got some very amazing sunset shots with palm trees shadowed in the foreground.  I only wish Olympus would have also put a \"sunrise\" option on the camera, as I think it would also do well there. ( ok, guys... I'm kidding. And little humor here).<br /><br /> I've been running each program on the camera, using the A, S, and Program settings.  I've stopped down and up for highlight and back lit subjects,  used the close up function, action shot function, etc.  In the old days we may shoot some 36-50 shots and have 4-5 that came out the way we wanted.  In using my E-300 I have just put some 55 shots on a CD and I'd estimate at least 75% -80%  of them are even better than anticipated.  I'm sure this is due to the fact that during the day one can simply delete and shoot again for a better photo.  I should also mention that I am shooting on a lower than highest quality due to my need to email the photos.  Even with the lower setting of some 3.6 - 4.3 megs the photos are sharp, clear and detailed of likes I have never seen from a digital camera.<br /><br /> I've printed some of the photos out on photo paper at 8x10 inches and posted them on my office wall.  More than one person has commented on the great photos... they really look great, such detail and again I am not even on the highest setting!<br /><br /> In short I am more than impressed with the camera.  I would not dream of sending it back.  She is a very high quality camera, and in the 48 hrs of its use I have come to love it!  It's simply in a word........fantastic!<br /><br /> Some concerns ( compaints is simply to harsh a word for this camera).<br /><br />I'd like to see all DSLR makers give you at least one small recording  card with the camera for taking photos.  For near $1000.00 we can't even be able to save one photo?  Come on.<br /><br />I do not like that fact that there is no way to take a time exposure with some sort of cable or electrical control.  I suppose the remote takes care of this?  Don't know, but I intend to get the remote and see if in fact the camera can take time exposures on a tripod for times of 2-4-8 etc seconds.<br /><br /> While the other cameras I looked at are also high quality cameras, and I'm sure they all take great photos.  I cannot recommend the E-300 enough.  It is one of the few times in life I have parted with a moderate sum $1000.00 ( +/-) and after the fact pleased by the transaction.  Not unlike a fine car, or a very expensive dinner out on the town... as long as the quality is there you don't mind parting with the green at the end of the day.  My purchase of this camera is a high point in my love of photo taking.  Buy one, and I doubt you will  be disappointed!","Hey guess who!? The sinister minister with yet another Digicam review!Well the E300 brings my camera count up to 5 and it may very well decrease it. I have by nature been very weary of the digital SLR's even though I sell tons of them every week, I have used the Canon XT and 20D, and the Nikon D70, consistantly. I have demonstrated them untill I can set one up in my sleep, and as fast and advanced as they may seem I just couldn't get past thier hefty price tags.But then here comes the E300, the first thing you notice about this camera is it looks like no other SLR on the market, it almost like a stealth camera! Size wise it compares pretty evenly with its counterparts, however it is somewhat lighter. Unlike the Rebel XT however this camera is built like a tank, with a good solid hand grip, and a textured metal body. That aside the main thing that attracted me to this camera was the fact that it uses Digital Zuiko lenses, each lens has its own processor! How cool is that! Not to mention the benefits you get when reading light or getting in focus. And to top that off they are sanely priced!! Now the most important feature of any camera my friends is what you buy it for, and that is pictures! The E-300 takes amazing pictures! It takes them fast, clear, and in just about any light situation you can think of. Oh and by the way? thats before you even start to mess around with the settings! Lets talk about a few: ISO: Neat feature the E300 has is a thing called \"ISO Boost\" you can switch the 2 highest ISO settings on or off (800 & 1600)! Noise in this department was pretty darn good until you shoot at 1600 then it gets a bit spooky, there aren't many cameras that don't (believe me) even the 20D you fantasize about takes a crappy shot with the ISO cranked up! Shutter speeds are about even with most other SLRs, and it even has an 8 minute \"Bulb\" mode (Hooray) but you have to hold the shutter button down (BOO).Menues: This camera has the coolest, and easiest to use damn menu system I have ever seen! I love it I was running thru things like I had owned the camera for years after just a few minutes, Nothing like the Canons (some things on those I still can't find!!) 8MP: my favorite resolution! I own 4 8MP cameras and I love every one of them! I well tell you now what I tell all my customers at Bestbuy anything over 8MP is a waste of money and time, I think even 8MP is more than most people need.5MP is average 6 is just stupid, 7MP is a good point and shoot. But SLRs need to be at least 8MP (hello Nikon?) The lens ranges work so well with that resolution anything less is really an injustice (I think).Scene Modes: Yes the E-300 has a ton of them (see spec's above) including the \"Sunset Mode\" (I love Nikon's)This is almost as good although a little too red at times. I haven't had the camera long so I haven't had the chance to run thru them all, but the ones I have used have all been right on the money. Speed: well okay this one has to go to the 20D, speed wise the E-300 is about par, but it's not gonna win any races about 4 frames at 2.5 sec for as long as the shutter is pressed.White balance features are excellent in this camera ranging from auto to 3000k all the way up to 7500k in addition to 4 spaces for custom settings (nice job Olympus).Full AF or manual focus modes as well as several combinations of the two! Flash: the E-300 probably has the best on board flash of any camera I have ever used, and without a doubt the most versitile as far as being able to control intensity, speed, etc. I actually like using it (Normally I hate flash photography). Huge selection of Image formats: this camera will save your pictures in at least 20 different files types and resolutions, not to mention you can completely edit Raw image files directly within the camera! Exsposure, contrast, sharpness the whole deal right on board. Battery life is excellent being as good as my F-828 at 230-220 minutes.Micro-drive capable, and I absolutely love the Zuiko lenses.I have to admit I never thought I would own an Olympus let alone one of thier SLRs, Olympus has a tendency to cut on quality when it comes to thier lower end models the people that own em love em. However I have always heard that Olympus high end cameras are among the best. After using the E-300 I would agree WOW!.This camera has so many other benifits and features that I can't go into here, so check your online review sources and make up your own mind. As I said I am a professional photographer and I sell cameras and aside from some bells and whistles, speed you'll never use, the E-300 is everybit as good a digital SLR camera as its Canon and Nikon counterparts (more so in some ways)The biggest being price!<br /><br />I added another lens to mine and a Microdrive (4gb) and a Canon would have still cost me more, and I'd still be lost in those menus!Want my advice? Put the E-300 on your short list and decide based on picture and price, not speed. Weather its film or digital, photography has always been about the pictures, SLR's by nature take amazing photographs, is it really worth it to have to take on a second job just to pay for it!? I hope this helps somewhat, after I have used the camera a while I may offer an update, until then Happy shooting!","The E-300 is one outstanding digital camera.  I have been doing 35mm for many years, and it was nice to find a digital camera that has the look and feel of a high end 35mm.  It even has the sound of the shutter clicking and the film winding sound also.  A very easy to use camera, once I figured out the menus.  Pictures are outstanding even at the middle of the resolution range.  Good job, Olympus!  But... I could mention two complaints, neither of which will make me return the camera.  One, the camera does have a bit of a problem taking flash pictures in low light conditions.  And the other problem, an obvious money-grubbing device (Bad Olympus!), the AC adapter that sells for $130 or so could be replaced by any $10 wall wart, except for that little proprietary connector on the camera.  Come on, Olympus, what's up with that?","When I decided to go fully digital I read every review I could find.  Not having $6-7000 to spend I kept it under $2500.<br /><br />This is the best camera out there in this price range.  It is sharper than any of the others.  There are minor complaints about color acuracy, but that is a lot easier to fix than lack of sharpness.<br /><br />Very powerful flash.  Amazing for its size.<br /><br />Nice weight and balance.<br /><br />If you want a DSLR this is really the best you can get for under<br /><br />$1000 and that is with 2 lenses.","Before, I bought the E-300,I looked at the other SLR camera's and was impressed by some of them. But, not as impressed by the E-300. The E-300 caught my eye by it's looks and it's functions. Also, all things it can do! Plus it was easy to use! When I first started using the camera I was \"VERY\" impressed by how well the pictures were coming out. I am pretty impressed with the E-300! I am \"GLAD\" I choose this camera and I would not trade it in for anythings else.","Nice pictures, good price, bring me total different feeling comparing with my other digi cameras.","I received the Olympus E-300 (EVOLT) for Christmas and I am extremely happy with the camera's performance.  The look, the feel, handling, image quality and the many, many features are just what I was looking for in a DSLR.  The focal plane dust removal system is unmatched by Canon and Nikon.  The imager chip used is the Kodak KAF8300CE, a high performance CCD.  Since one of my intended applications is astrophotography, I am interested in the ultimate in performance from my DSLR.  I would recommend this DSLR to anyone interested in having the best!<br /><br />The purchase was from Adorama by way of Amazon.","I compare the Evolt to the E20, which I owned for several years. In comparison, the Evolt looks like this:<br /><br />1) Very lightweight.<br /><br />2) Much higher dynamic range (in RAW), contrast, sharpness, shot to shot speed. No Photoshop sharpening required.<br /><br />3) The nice E20 Manual/Auto Zoom switch is missing, but can be programed on the OK button.<br /><br />4) Viewfinder shutter switch missing. Instead a tiny piece of plastic has to be slid manually over the viewfinder.<br /><br />Really superslow is the solution for viewfinder shutter, which was a switch on the E20. That was excellent if you use it every few second for tripod shots with wired remote. Taking 100 shots in one hour you can just use the switch 100 times to look through the viewfinder. The Evolt on the other hand requires to peel of the rubber ring from the viewfinder and slide on a tiny plastic cover, which also could drop and disappear in the sand in a millisecond. This procedure is not suitable for being done every few seconds over and over again. That limits my usuall way of shooting with a tripod and a wired remote, checking the viewfinder for every shot. This is not possible with this camera the way it comes. But I will make my own viewfinder cover which should be removable in a fraction of a second, and put on again also as quickly, without removing the rubber-eyepiece.<br /><br />The lens, when fully zoomed out, can be wiggled around for about 1mm in each direction up/down/sideways on the lens hood. This is also different from the E20, where nothing would extend when zooming. Everything happend completly inside and enclosed. I did not see any picture quality issues or dust-proof problems on the Evolt related to this yet.<br /><br />Olympus reduced the price compared to the E1 to half, in order to enter the amateur market. Therefore they had to reduce production cost and leave out some convenience features, like viewfinder shutter switch, manual/auto-zoom switch, basic information LCD on top of the camera.  But they still have dead pixel mapping in the camera menue, which is really good.<br /><br />RAW to 16bit TIFF conversion is at this point of time in December 2004 only available in the Olympus Studio Software.<br /><br />Rolf Bertram<br /><br />[...]","It's got a lot going for it, but no one has seen pictures from a production model yet.

I bought a SDHC (High Capacity) memory card and got a \"memory card error.\"  I then installed a 2GB SD which worked fine.  I bought a generic battery charged which worked well.  I used / tested the camera on two beach trips.  The color reproduction was brilliant and exceeded my expectations.  Autofocus worked well but of course was not up to today's (2012) standards.  Shots using the zoom of tennis players from a distance of 50 feet was disappointing upon medium enlargement (considerably inferior to my ancient Konica Minolta Dimage Z10).  All in all an excellent purchase for the money (total investment $95).  4 stars.","I bought this camera almost 10 years ago.  It's still going strong.  Picture quality is good.  I paid $160 for it back then and will buy it again in a heartbeat.","I bought my SD200 Elph in Summer 2005, took it to Europe for two weeks, and have carried it on every vacation since. It works great, no cracked screen or other issues. Just ordered a backup battery and more memory cards for it. Very happy with 3.2 megapixel quality.","Great image quality due to a fantastic image processor. Tiny screen, 3.2 MP, but who really cares: the pictures are great quality on a machine or printed to 5x7. No image stabilization, smile finder, or other special features, but a very fine macro setting. It's a great camera to travel with and does fine work. All stainless steel body is very rugged and quite tiny, but heavy. Very satisfying to own and use.","Even tho this camera is an older model, the features found on one of these older higher priced models are really good.  A very good buy with almost all of the orginal acessories.","I carried this camera in my purse for three years. Great pictures and easy to keep with me. If my cell phone was not equiped with a camera it would still be in my purse. LOVE it!","It came with nothing I order a charger and got canon to send me the software so basically i'm happy it works and takes decent pictures.","Was a great camera for a few yrs. It ultimatly turned on in a bag and since the lense comes out its gears that operate the lense focus got messed up. It took great pics when it worked. I will by another canon powershot soon. 3.2 megapixels was barely enough for photos. Plenty for web only but not for print. I dont think you can even buy any new cameras with much under 5 megapixels now anyway. Bottom line Canon makes great cameras buy one you wont be disappointed.","I bought it for my sister. She carries it everywhere she goes. Takes good quality pictures. Recommend it.","I love this camera! It is small enough to carry in your purse! It takes fantastic pictures and is so simple to use. I love the battery it uses! No more charging and buying batteries!","this was a great camera for my kids...had one problem with an \"E18\" error so we sent it in for repairs and its been great....","I wanted a small camera which took good pictures and good video. the size on this camera is great which allows for me to take it anywhere.<br /><br />The picture and color quality are very good, not great, but very good. For the size, I can't complain.<br /><br />The video quality was pretty good at the time I bought it (17 months ago) and the camera has taken a few knocks over the time I have owned it. Be sure to have a large SD card for the videos.<br /><br />For the price and all around qualities, I am really happy with this purchase.","I honestly don't know much about cameras, but I love this one.  This camera has literally been all over the world with me and perfectly captures every moment.  I've had it for about 2 1/2 years and it hasn't failed me yet.  The pictures are phenomenal and unbelievably clear.  The video sound is a little soft though.  Unfortunately I've broken the screen twice.  The first time Canon fixed it for free.  I'm just ready for an upgrade and am awaiting the arival of my SD800.","I'm just gonna say that , \"that is the camera\"!!!<br /><br />I have never seen anything near like it.<br /><br />I had a Sony before and was a total garbage, most of the pictures were fuzzy ! I tought it was my camera that was defective, after seen some friend's sony cameras and after reading a lot of reviews, \" I \" (myself) think sony's cameras are really garbage, even the 2007 new ones.( just search for reveiews). And will never buy a sony again.<br /><br />With this canon over 100 to 200 pictures I take during some parties, I get 1 or 2 fuzzy, while with the sony it was usually 80%. I caouldnt believe.<br /><br />I have droped this camera thousand times on the floor AAAAAANNNNDDDD the most impossible I was pushed into a swimming pool with this camera in my pocket, and after opeing and drying it, still works perfect after more than one year. it's like a rock!<br /><br />I have token more than 12000 pics during last 2 years, and I have just one thing to say... \"I 'm glad having bought this Canon! \"<br /><br />I just love it! Now I am searching for a new camera to my sister, and, it will be a Canon! Don';t know witch one yet, but I already know the brand!!!<br /><br />Hope everyone have a great experience with their cameras like I had!","Yes it is a great camera. I use it mostly to sell on line with, from little rings to furniture and the photos are great. On the plus side, this was a great camera to take on vaction. My daughter took over 300 photos one day at the lake. I did buy a bigger memory card which seems to never get full when the daughter takes it out for the day. The size is great, fits in most pockets esp. jeans. I love the fact that when with family at big gatherings, my camera lasts out the others as far as keeping power. I use it daily and only have to charge it about once a week, depending on how often I use it. Downloading photos to computer is very simple. If you want an easy pick and shoot camera with out having to think, this is it. I would love to get a second or third one for my daughter and boyfriend so they quit grabbing mine...","I love this camera. It is small, has all of the features I want, and has worked flawlessly. I liked it so much, I got it for my sister as a gift and she loves it as well. Hers has received A LOT more use and the switch that goes between playback/video/camera mode is getting a bit of wear (sometimes, the camera is confused what mode it is in), but that's the only issue -- and she sort of abuses her camera (no case, etc.), so I think that kind of result might be expected. Otherwise, this camera is great. If this camera died today, I'd buy it again but unfortunately I can't because they don't make 3.2mp models anymore :(","Great camera, takes wonderful shots of your memories without requiring a great detail of experience.","This product is great. I've compared it with much expensiver cameras, and the desing, material and pictures are really good, besides the price is very afordable.<br /><br />I trully recomend it.","Since the top reviewers on this product covered the camera fairly well I'll only add some points they didnt mention that I think should be addressed.<br /><br />For almost two years now I have had my photos listed in the Customer Image section above to give people an idea of the quality of the pics.<br /><br />The issues that I have had with the top reviewer are listed in the comment section nder his review.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Macro feature is pretty good for this type of camera. Snapshots of flowers provide exceptionally well detail.<br /><br />- Vivid feature enables the colors to come out much more richer. This is great for taking some floral pics or especially when taking sunset shots.<br /><br />- Night mode enables you to take some really cool pictures of a variety of things; fireworks, Las Vegas night life. Make sure to have a tripod and modify the shutter speed for some photos.<br /><br />- Manual mode can allow you to control the shutter speed, color (b/w, vivid, sepia) and more.<br /><br />- Video mode really comes in handy when you either left the video camera at home or decided to just use this as your video camera. It has built in sound as well. Different quality and sizes of video are available depending on the space on your SD card and if you plan to email the videos.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Red eye as a result of the bright flash is terrible. Almost every indoor flash picture comes out with too much red eye. The red eye feature simply doesnt work well enough. This is the main reason why I reduced the rating by two stars. My wife is so annoyed with the red eye results that she wants to get a new camera. So this is something to reall consider.<br /><br />- No battery meter. You wont know that the camera is running low on battery until its about to die. You would have to remember to charge it after a lot of usage or bring a spare charged battery in case.","This review was written only to tell everyone that the screen is very fragile.<br /><br />I am an extremely careful person and have gone to great lengths to protect the camera. Unfortunately just last week, I became another one of the many disappointed customers to find a broken LCD screen on their SD200.<br /><br />Be careful when buying.","I've had several small digital cameras in the past, but none compare to the Canon Powershot series in picture quality. This camera is perfect to carry in your pocket all the time.","I had previous experience with canon digital cameras and after my old powershot S50's screen cracked, I thought, no big deal just buy another canon. Anyway, bought this camera (actually bought 2 - the other one I gave as a gift to my sister)and over past 6 months use here are my impressions:<br /><br />Pros:<br />>great portable shooter for first timers<br />>intuitive controls, including easy video function<br />>great basic camera for getting 4x6 pics<br /><br />Cons:<br />>LCD screen again cracked without explanation<br /><br />The screen cracking again on this camera together with what happened to my SD50 leads me to believe that the LCD's on Canons are very fragile and you probably have to buy a hard case to enclose this camera to protect from possible damage. Given that cracked lcd's on digitals render them almost useless, a future improvement from Canon should include reinforcement of these screens or possibly use a sliding cover to protect them when not in use.","it is a great camera for<br /><br />1. it's size<br /><br />2. performace<br /><br />3. price<br /><br />It takes crisp pictures. I took lots of shots so far both in out door as well as indoor, it never disappointed me. Camera size never compromised with quality of pictures. Pictures always turned great. Thanks to canon Digic processor. This camera is very compact, in fact all this series of cameras, you can carry anywhere just like a cell phone. It fits in your shirt pocket as well. It comes with rechargeble battery, so saved little money for batteries. If one does not want long zooms, this would be the best buy.","I bought this camera for my girlfriend, and she's had it for about 4 months now. We had an issue with the actual button you press to take a picture falling off. We sent it back to Cannon and they repaired it for free under warantee. Since then the camera has been fine, until....a couple of days ago. Now the lens will not extend and makes a grinding sound when turned on. Needless to say the camera will be going back and hopefully repaired under warantee but this is just plain getting annoying. When the camera works its PERFECT - but all these little issues are really starting to make me wish I bought one of the higher end SD's like the 450.","I have owned SD200 for six months now and I am very happy with it. It is great value for money. It has all the features I wanted - small size, cheap, low pixelage (yes low pixelage!). The camera is very sleek and fits into any pocket (even a tight jeans pocket). That's a major plus point about it. It is 3.2 MP which is all I needed as I never take prints larger than postcard size. High MP cameras are recommended only if you plan to print large posters, if you are not going to do that, don't waste your money on 6+ MP cameras. It's photo quality is excellent for its price. Soon I am going to buy a digital SLR but that's not because I am not happy with this one. I am 100% satisfied with this camera. Small point and shoot cameras and bulky DSLRs have their own utilities and one can't be subsituted for the other.<br /><br />One thing I like is that I can switch of the LCD screen and take photos using viewfinder, that saves a lot of battery! You can take a lot more photos with LCD switched off. Don't go for a camera that doesn't have a viewfinder or doesn't allow you to switch off LCD. Battery life is average, but when on trips I generally switch off LCD while taking dayshots. Then battery can last for the whole 3-4 day trip with 400+ photos without recharging the battery.<br /><br />Pros -<br /><br />-Very sleek<br /><br />-Excellent picture quality for it's price<br /><br />-Very low flash charging time<br /><br />-Unlimited video shooting at decent resolution<br /><br />-Cheap<br /><br />Cons-<br /><br />-Does not have bulb setting so you can't keep the shutter open for unlimited time for night shots.<br /><br />-Doesn't use AA or AAA batteries (but that's not a biggie as long as you remember to charge it before heading on to your trip and take the charger with you).","The Canon SD200 goes everywhere in my wife's purse.<br /><br />It takes great pictures, indoors and out.  The only setting my wife messes with is flash.  This camera is perfect for her.<br /><br />The viewfinder is a plus as it enables her to steady the camera by holder her camera hand against her face.  Using the viewfinder, rather than the LCD, extends battery life.<br /><br />This camera is great for short videos of our granddaughter.  With a little care, it is suitable for natural-light photos.  It focuses in low light.  Shutter response is good.  Digital \"Noise\" is a bit better than what one should expect.<br /><br />This is our 4th digital camera, and our favorite for casual use.  It just works.","One of my best gifts for myself last Christmas!<br /><br />A perfectly sized camera that goes everywhere, captures great images, and is priced well enough that you will take into all situations.<br /><br />Only downside is the tradeoff of size versus handling.  The smaller camera does require more dexterity to hold...a small price to pay to take anywhere.<br /><br />View screen has not been a issue, as others have noted.  I have dropped once while in Canon case.  No adverse impact.","I hate to sound glowing and non-objective in a review, but I absolutely love this camera. I was hesitant to buy a Canon after my last Elph showed poor battery life and mediocre picture quality. Nonetheless, it was good ENOUGH to keep me in the family. This camera, however, is everything I could ever want in a camera. It is gorgeous, tiny, tough (I've dropped it a couple times accidentally), was easy to set up, and has all the features I could imagine wanting. I am a student, and I take pictures of charts and graphs in text books that look amazingly sharp (make sure to push the \"close-up\" button, it makes all the difference). The manual features are great for getting just the right look anywhere (another tip: I highly suggest taking many photos with the ISO set to 400 without a flash). The Photostitch software is really fun to play with if you enjoy photography at all (lets you piece pictures together to make a panarama). I can't comment on the main software program, because I plug my memory card straight into my computer without the camera, and I use Picassa software from Google (free, good program).<br /><br />This camera is one of the best purchases I've ever made. I can't imagine needing another camera for a long, long time.","This was the first digital camera I ever owned- my dad bought it for my 21st birthday last year.<br /><br />This camera was perfect for me, someone who just wanted a camera to take pictures of my friends and events in college. Unfortunately, the camera was dropped and the screen was cracked. The camera, however, continued to operate although I couldn't change any features. I used it right up until it got stolen recently.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I love this camera and I am definitely planning on buying another one as soon as funds provide. But for those who just want a camera to take decent pictures and who want features that are easy to use and understand, this is the one to get!","This camera was purchased as a gift for my son last November.  He had an error message that displayed when the camera lens would not close.  I provided him with the purchase information and warranty card (which he left at home when he headed back to college)and he contacted Canon for service.  By the time I spoke to him again, he had already shipped off the camera for service and received it back in 'good as new' condition.  Total cost to him was less than $7 shipping.<br /><br />I'm thinking that I might need to purchase the 2 year service plan Amazon offers with these.  :-)","Love this little camera but the LCD cracked after less then 6 months of use as well.  I thought one of my friends dropped it but it looks like a pretty common occurence.  Maybe I'll get it serviced.<br /><br />Either way, the quality of the pics is excellent and honestly, who needs 8 Megapixels anyway.","I am really enjoying the camera.  It's easy to use and I like that it is small but has a large viewing screen.  Great camera for the price.","Bought two of these for my daughters. Pros: Takes excellent pictures; convenient size; easy to use; many feautures for the money; excellent value.<br /><br />Cons: LCD cracked, not from dropping or abuse. A little research shows this is not uncommon for the SD200 or SD300.  Sounds like defect to me.  Will try to get it repaired because we like the camera, but I'm a bit wary now.","Wow. Where do I start?<br /><br />Well first off, I got this as a X mas present. I popped in the included 16 mb card to start shooting. That small of a card goes into the \"why even bother\" department. It holds about eight high resolution jpeg images.<br /><br />I got a kingston 512mb card as another present.<br /><br />Have no doubts about buying this camera. Dont let the small megapixel count fool you into thinking its low grade.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />1. Unless you are totally new to cameras, shoot in manual mode. It gives you a lot more options.<br /><br />2. Use a custom white balance. The auto white balance is okay, but not always correct.<br /><br />3. Press the shutter halfway. The focusing will be done. Then push the button the rest of the way, and it will be faster. Better pictures!<br /><br />4. DONT USE DIGITAL ZOOM! It may sound good, but it makes your pictures extremely fuzzy and awful.<br /><br />5.For movies, shoot in Fast Frame Rate. 60 frames per second! The quality is unbelievable.<br /><br />6. If you turn off the flash you may find that your pictures get fuzzy. Try turning up the ISO. If its still fuzzy get a tripod.<br /><br />All in all this is the best compact digital I've used.","I have been using this camera for over a year now and have taken it with me on many travels to other countries.  I have been very happy with the picture quality and really like this camera.  The battery life is excellent and this is an easy camera to travel with (I had no problems with international adaptors, etc).  There is some difficulty shooting in bright light settings and the red eye function doesn't work well (although easily correctable with the software).  I would definitely recommend this as I great point and shoot camera.","I've had the camera for 11 months taken hundreds of wonderful pictures. Then one day the camera was in my daughters purse and the LCD suddently appeard broken (no physical sign of abuse) but it had turned white with purple feathering on the screen (internal damage of some sort).  I read about others having difficulties with service of LCD's from Canon so I thought I share mine recent experience.<br /><br />First I want to say that Canon was EXCELLENT about handling the return/repair. I called their service center and they told me where to send it, never was a cost mentioned. Sent camera w/store receipt and warranty card; 7 days later had letter from Canon stating camera had been received and their diagnosis was a cracked LCD (caused by pressure). The very next day I had camera delivered at my door by Fed-Ex, only 8 days after I'd sent it to them. I could not be happier with their service. Maybe they've heard and recognize a screen problem and that are now dealing with it in the professional manner the should have originally.<br /><br />In any case, have my wonderful little camera back, good as new.  Happy with Canon and their service/support.  Now wanting the sweet SD550.","I love this camera.  I've owned several point and shoot digital cameras, and this is the best of the bunch.  Everything about it is top notch except for it's red eye reduction.  Red eye is almost always present.  It's not that big of a deal for me as I can remove that with software fairly easily, but it's worth mentioning because it is a major problem.  Other than that, this camera out performs every other mini digital camera I've owned.","Very small and easy to use snapshot camera.<br /><br />I like the LCD screen and lots of manual functions, too.<br /><br />The automatic controls are a bit off when taking pictures in the dark and also in moving vehicles, but once you switch it to manual, then you can take nice pictures in all conditions.<br /><br />For some reason, it does eat up battery.  I find myself using up a battery with one days picture taking.  Maybe turning it on and off drains power because I didn't even come close to the number of pictures taken for a full battery.  More like half.<br /><br />I brought it on my Peru trip and went backpacking with it.  It was awesome!","Excellent camera from the price.  Highly recommended for a bargain priced camera, but it has all the features of its more expensive brethen.","If you are looking for your first digital camera, the SD 200 is the one to go for.<br /><br />I got mine for $175 in November 2005. At that price its a steal.<br /><br />The main advantage is the small form factor, which means you can carry the camera easily in your jeans or shirt pocket rather than buy a special camera pouch or bag.","Takes clear photos even in low light situations. I like the compact size. Works great for my use.","I bought this compact guy about 3 months back. the photo is sharp and the resolution ability is powerful. the only con is that this is not so cool as the sample picture.","I brought this camera for my presonal use and now after using it for a month now I think its worth investment I have made. The photos come out really very good, even when the light is low (ofcourse i had enabled auto flash). Outdoor snaps turned out to be excelllent.<br /><br />The best part is its so handy that it can be carried anywhere anytime.","this is the best value out there.  the canon sd200 takes great pictures, and for 169 dollars it was the best snapshot camera ive purchased yet!  lightweight, compact, and rechargeable (very important).","I was at first hesitant to buy the canon sd200 because of apparent problems with the lcd screen.  Then i heard about the da oly protector from daproducts.com.  It fit perfectly on the camera and keeps the lcd free from scratches or cracks.  If you buy this camera you should definitely consider purchasing the protector.  Without it I wouldn't have peace of mind about putting the slim camera in my pocket for easy storage.  Overall Great Picture quality and extremely long battery life.","I have a Rebel XT but have always been in the need of a decent small camera to carry around because of the ease of doing it. I bought this for my wife and it was the best purchase of Christmas.<br /><br />It is rugged, the pics are high quality, and perfect, especially for a woman's small hands. The card it comes with is small so buy at last a 256mb card and you can take about 200 High qual pics or 1000 standard. The flash is also much brighter than I thought and the quality of the built in video is great as well.","I wanted a small digital camera to take travel pictures.  This is a great small camera - the automatic settings are easy to use.  I especially like the one-touch download feature and the automatic settings for night pictures.  A friend liked the pictures from my camera so much he bought one on vacation.","After reading many complaints about the \"fragile\" LCD screen and worrying (needlessly) about purchasing this camera, I went ahead and bought it. This camera is a bargain! Lots of great features! Long lasting battery, perfect crisp macro pictures, continuous shooting mode, b&w or sepia pictures or movies.<br /><br />As for the LCD screen, if you read the instruction manual, it does say to prevent damage to the screen from condensation, to keep the camera in a resealable plastic bag when going from hot to cold or cold to hot temps and letting it come to room temperature before using!<br /><br />The movies from this camera are the BOMB! No need for a camcorder if you have a 1G SD card!<br /><br />I also love the girly features such as colors for the clock screen, wallpaper, sounds (dog barking, wolf howling, bird chirping), etc.<br /><br />Anyone interested in the Canon hard case for this should go to Best Buy-they have a similar generic, genuine leather, hard case for only $7 and carry it in black, brown, red, or croc embossed!<br /><br />I'm having a blast with this camera and find it well worth the price!","my mom has a s400 elph. she convinced me to get this at about 200 with a memory card. i jus got it today. i have been playing with da features like slo motion video. its quite fun to take pics. there are alot of options to use. its also so light compared to a s400, it is also very small with a nice bright screen for viewing crisp pics. a must have if u want something cheap. i reccomend a lexar memory card.","After reading several reviews of different digital cameras on the Web, I chose the SD200 for its price/value point, and I am not disappointed.<br /><br />This camera is definitely worth it.","I just got this camera today and it's great!  I needed a smaller one just to take around college.  My other camera was too big to just slip in my pocket and I found myself just never taking pictures.  But now I can just take the sd200 anywhere.  The camera is also loaded with options and takes awesome pictures.<br /><br />So you know how big it is, the camera is about the size of an altoids box.  It also is very, very light.<br /><br />All around great camera!","This is a great little camera.  I've carried it for the last 6 months in my sleeve cargo pocket while in Iraq--without a case, and haven't had any problems w/ the screen.  It's handy, lightening fast, and takes crystal clear photos.  Everyone who's seen it or taken pictures with it wants one.  And the ability to recharge on 110/220 V is great for traveling.  The battery will usually last at least a week or more while taking a few snap shots a day.  I highly recommend it as an alternative to a big--slow--expensive camera.  Get a 512 SD card and you'll be set for anything.  3.2 mega does the trick for most users.  For under $200 nothing else compares, buy it!  Or if you insist on spending more, buy the newer SD400.","For me, this is almost the perfect camera.  It takes great pictures, and has a pretty good optical zoom.  Any better than 3x might be unusable for such a small camera, because the lens would shake too much without a tripod.  I think the small size and light weight makes it more vulnerable to camera shake.  But that's OK, because I love the small size; it makes it possible/practical to take the camera wherever I go.<br /><br />This camera has a great continuous shooting mode, which I almost always use to take pictures of my daughter (who's 3 and always moving, so it takes a lot of tries to get a perfect shot).  The continous mode is fast enough, although not as fast as some more expensive (and larger) cameras I've tried.  I wish the continuous mode would stay on my default, so I don't have to turn it on manually every time I turn on the camera.  I bought the SD200 instead of the 300 because the I don't need the 300's extra pixels, and the 200 has a faster continuous mode.<br /><br />It also has video mode which has made my video camera nearly obsolete.  It takes DV-quality movies of unlimited length (until your SD card is full).  I wish it had stereo sound though.  And, you can't zoom or change focus while taking a movie.  Once in a while I get a video that is out of focus.  But this is still not a good enough reason to lug my video camera around.  There are some great videos of my daughter which I only got because the camera happened to be in my pocket.<br /><br />I do have problems with redeye when using the flash, but I rarely use the flash.","You really can't go wrong if you're thinking about buying this great camera-the Canon Powershot SD200 3.2MP Digital Elph Camera with 3v Optical Zoom. With so many brands on the market and so many choices, where does one begin to find the right camera for their personal needs? Where does one begin to isolate the camera that they want to buy for themselves or as a gift?<br /><br />I hope that this personal and honest review will help you to narrow your search and help you develop more faith in what you're buying. So if you're looking for an outstanding digital camera, you've found it with this great one from Canon. This is a VERY dependable camera, probably in the top of the review listings and don't let its smaller size fool you at all! It's a camera that will always take color-rich and great photos for you-even if you make a slight mistake or move your hands just a tiny bit when photographing. It actually has a great deal of technology that is built-in and designed to compensate for anyone who might be in a poor lighting situation or someone who forgets to focus well before shooting the picture.<br /><br />Canon Powershot Digital Cameras are hard to compare with others in the this arena. I've had a Powershot for a long time and I've taken over five thousand photos with it-it stands up against me dropping it or taking photographs in the rain. Aside for requiring powerful alkaline batteries that use a good amount of power, there is no downside to this incredible digital camera from a great digital camera maker. Canon was in the camera business decades before digital cameras were even on the market.<br /><br />If you're looking for a gift for someone, you've found it in the Powershot SD200. If you are an avid photographer, like myself, and wish to have a camera for digital shots-this is the baby you'll want to buy or one you'll want as backup.<br /><br />There is a great deal of information that you can read about this camera  on the Canon website and other review sites online. You can compare the camera with others in the same category. You might find some slightly better deals with other brands that might offer increased amounts of Megapixels. That is NOT what you should be looking for. You will never need a 7 Megapixel camera unless you plan on blowing up your photos into poster-sized photos, so don't think that your Canon is less-than or not up to the standards of cameras with much higher Megapixels. Often the number of Megapixels is only possible with the use of special software to inerpolate the photographs. You don't want to have to worry about all of that. You are set with the Canon!<br /><br />Canon puts together an entire Kit or Package when you buy the Digital Elph. I wanted to also let you know that the software that's included with the camera package is fantastic and is literally worth the price of the camera in itself. However, you're getting a super package with this deal and a camera that can depend on for as long as you want to own the camera. I've  exposed it mine to rain about 10 different times, and I've not EVER had any even a small incidental problem. It's like the Energizer Bunny of Digital Cameras-It just keeps on Going and Going and Going and never stops!<br /><br />I hope that this honest review was of some help to you as it was a pleasure to write it for you.<br /><br />Pete Cannice<br /><br />Scottsdale, Arizona","When this camera first came and I opened the box it was smaller than I expected it to be.<br />The basic reason I wanted a camera was to click prictures when I am out partying which means that the camera is not handled with care. But this camera was so sturdy that during Halloween the button to click the pictures fell off but it was easily reattached.<br />Another reason I had heard was that higher mega pixel cameras require a lot of stabilty in your hands which is not usually the case during partying or just chilling when you actually need the pictures to be clicked to preserve the moment. This camera clicks pictures which are very good. I mean you dont need detailed functions which take time to understand and use as special moments do not last for ever.<br />This fits in easily anywhere and the battery lasts for ever. Its definitely worth the price you pay for it.","I've had this camera for over a year now and couldn't be happier with it.  Obviously it's very small, which works out great for those that travel a lot or generally like taking a camera wherever they go.<br /><br />Picture quality isn't amazing, but very good.  And at 3.2MP, there's enough resolution to print out an 8x10 photo...why would you need anything bigger?<br /><br />I purchased the underwater camera case accesory.  It's a bit pricey (around $100), but well worth it for the money if you know you're going to use it a lot.  I took it to Florida during vacation and took hundreds of photos that turned out brilliant.  I HIGHLY recommend using the \"underwater\" setting available.  I took a few without it just to see the difference.  They were very blue-saturated.  The \"underwater\" setting eliminated all of that, leaving a clear image.  With the attached strap, it wasn't a hassle to carry around either, even underwater.  We did lots of snorkling (sp?) and diving with no problems.<br /><br />On the con side:<br /><br />- There's no battery life indicator!  The only time you know the state of the battery is when it's very low.<br /><br />- The lcd scratches easily, but that's to be expected.  I haven't had any problems with the case itself scratching.<br /><br />- The included SD card won't hold that many photos.  Just spend the extra money and get more memory.  They're fairly cheap these days.  I bought the 256mb, and it holds plenty (hundreds).<br /><br />Overall, great camera for the price, size, and ease of use.  I did a lot of research on compact cameras before I bought, and this one has met all my expectations.","This camera is great and really easy to use and understand.  The amount of pictures you can take is awesome and the quality is excellent.  And its great because you can snap an image as much as you want and then erase what doesn't work to find that special picture.  All my friends have the elf as well.","This camera is perfect for anyone who is looking for a user-friendly device.  It gives enough options (speed adjustment, light adjustment, video) for everyday use.  The rechargable battery alone makes it a great buy.  You save tons of money on batteries and the charger is easy to use and quick.","Zero complaints about this camera for what I paid.  Yes, you can get a better camera in terms of resolution or functions, but you probably won't need more than you get with the SD200.  I've had mine for just over a year now.  It consistantly takes sharp, well balanced photos, the shutter lag is negligible, the battery life is reasonable and the included charger is slim and charges the battery quickly.<br /><br />I bought this camera after extensively researching the options in this price range.  You will not be disappointed for the price.","I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a point and shoot type camera.  Very easy to use and adjust settings.  This camera takes outstanding photos!  I am highly impressed very satisfied with the overall quality of this camera!","I love this camera. It's my first digital camera and it's great. The monitor is clear and it's relatively easy to use. It's lightweight and captures great pictures.","i like this camera really much. it is so tiny and light. but the pictures are really good. i take it always with me.<br /><br />the could be more options. but the things it has are awesome.<br /><br />i woluld buy it again.","My daughter absolutely loves this camera.  It is much smaller than my wifes canon we bought a few years ago.  (She likes the new one better).  It is intuitive and takes great pics!","Great camera for a 3 pixel and the price.  Very easy to those not tech friendly.","I own a Digital Rebel and absolutely adore the photos I get from it. I've invested in a range of lenses, a decent external flash, remote control, etc. but the camera is so damn bulky I will only take it on my \"photo excursions\" into the real world.<br /><br />I've found I increasingly miss great shots and parties where carting a huge Digital SLR just isn't practical. To this end, I purchased an SD 200 prior to going down to Disneyland with my family. I didn't want to go on all the rides worrying about my camera and accompanying backpack.<br /><br />Pros: The SD200 is a tiny, tiny camera. It has the feel of a \"spy\" camera, the one I dreamed about when I was 10 years old. The shots in regular daylight are pretty accurate in color, sharp in detail and generally up to par with what you'd expect from a film point-and-shoot camera. In other words, I got exactly what I expected from the camera in its shots. On top of that, there is a fairly decent camcorder function. I'll be getting a larger 1 Gig SD card to take advantage of it, but the feature is so flexible and the video so good, it's worth leaving my Canon Elura at home (hardly a giant camcorder, but not pocket-sized either). The video is rendered as large as 30 fps and 640x480. I wish it was 720x480 but oh well.<br /><br />Cons: Almost a pro, this camera makes me appreciate just how gorgeous the Digital Rebel's photos are. There's no comparison in color, saturation, sharpness and above all, depth. The SD200 feels and shoots like a toy compared to the Rebel. But for my purposes, that's just what it is. I'll be carrying it with me everywhere now and getting all those shots I'd otherwise miss.<br /><br />Final con and this one is the largest - the flash on the SD200 is way too powerful. It literally blinds people and generates red eye EVERY time, even with red eye reduction deployed. The ironic thing is, when I take off the flash, the low-light pictures often come out well. My only real complaint is that I wish Canon allowed you to control the amount of flash generated. Maybe there's a firmware update. I'm looking now.","I purchased this Camera for work. I use it to document damage or lack of damage to rental equipment. For my application this unit performs great. I have several people that use this camera and have not had any of them asking how to use it.","I consider myself somewhat of a semi-professional photographer.  I used to work for Kodak in Professional Digital Photography department for a couple of years, so I do know a bit about photography in general, and digital photography in particular.  I do think, however, that my review will not only be useful to those who already know what digital photography is, and just looking for a new camera to replace/upgrade the old one, but also those who are completely new to the world of digital photography as well.  I'll go straight to pros and cons, since I think that's what most of people want to see in reviews, especially electronics' reviews.  So, here it goes...<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Compact - this is probably my favorite feature, if you can really call it a feature.  It's small.  It's very small, and thus portable.  You can put it in the pocket of your pants and/or shirt, although I wouldn't recommend doing it as it still has some weight to it.<br /><br />Aluminum case - another nice feature.  Most of the cameras on the market are made of plastic.  What happens to cameras when they get dropped on the floor?  They brake.  They brake easily.  Aluminum case on this camera does not, of course, make it indestructible, but it does add that extra layer of protection that most of us need.<br /><br />Decent picture quality - for a small camera, with only 3.2 MP, the picture quality is quite good.  I suggest you look for a different camera though if you are too \"picky\", because it's not perfect.<br /><br />Movie mode - I've been quite happy with it.  Shoots nice little video clips, which you can watch right away on your TV, by hooking the camera up using provided cables.<br /><br />Overall Ease of Use - another thing I like about this camera is that you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how to use it.  Yes, it comes with a nice little manual, but you can start using it right from the box.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Price - for this range of cameras it's quite expensive comparing to other brands.  You might want to consider a Nikon, Olympus, or maybe even a Kodak if you want to save yourself a \"few\" bucks.<br /><br />Battery life - in one word - horrible!  The battery lasts maybe an hour.  I strongly recommend you have a backup.  A couple of tips also: LCD takes up a lot of battery life, so minimize the use of it to a minimum.  Movies also tend to take more \"juice\" out of a battery.<br /><br />Virtually non-existent red-eye reduction - why do they have a red-eye reduction mode on this camera is beyond me.  The pictures of people and animals come out having red-eyes no matter which mode you are shooting in.  I use digital editing software to fix it.<br /><br />Flash - the flash is not very \"powerful\", if you know what I mean.  I guess, for this particular camera, since it's so compact, it's not bad, but for someone who's shooting a lot in the night mode, this could be a problem.<br /><br />Digital zoom is practically useless - just what it says - if you use it, you \"loose\" it.  If you use a digital zoom while making a picture, it will come out blurry.<br /><br />Shooting of moving/night objects - if you shoot a lot of moving objects and/or night objects, I suggest you look some place else.  This camera doesn't do a good job in either case.  It takes a lot of time tweaking between different modes/parameters for a picture of a moving car for example to come out right when using this camera.<br /><br />Not good enough of picture quality for Canon - I know I said that the picture quality of this camera is not bad, but... Canon is the world's leading manufacturer of digital photography equipment.  I think they can do better, especially considering the price.<br /><br />Summary:  This is not a bad camera by all means.  It's a good \"starting\" camera.  It's a Canon.  That means reliability.  If that's what you're looking for, go for it.  But if you don't care which brand it is, want to save yourself some money and still have a decent picture quality after all, I suggest you look some place else and read some more reviews on Amazon.","Totally impressed with this camera!  As a \"starter\" for me, I couldn't have asked for more: print quality and ease of operation.  Big criteria for me was that my \"non-techie\" wife be able to operate it successfully most of the time...She did!!!  Great value for the money.  Only thing that would've made it better (but probably more expensive) would've been to be able to rotate the viewer when aiming at something, while holding the camera in an awkward position.  If you're new to digital cameras this is a good one to start with!","I have been reviewing and comparing all the ultra-compacts and \"finally\" decided on the Canon SD series.....(it had the best reviews in the video mode as well as continuous shooting, great macro and 1-15 slow shutter speed.)  I was then torn between getting the older SD200 or going for the SD 400 with 5MP of resolution. Well, I called Canon asking multiple specific questions and found that the SD200 and the SD400 have the very same features and technology in almost everything...including the same video exactly. I found the 3.2 resolution produced terrific shots and were better than I had expected. The digital macro zoom was amazing. And don't miss the continuous shooting mode....it's impressive. If you don't need the \"color swap\" mode, the increased resolution or USB2 upload (SD200 has USB1)....then save a lot of money and get the same little camera for a LOT LESS MONEY! Do buy a 1GB memory card and a sturdy case. I also bought a screen protector...after reading all the problems w/LCD's. I occasionally had some red eye...but not too much. Photos taken in low lighting conditions w/o a flash turned out great. The SD200 comes with Arcsoft software that (most reviewers) feel is better than the software coming with the newer SD models.<br /><br />Negative...might be the flimsy plastic door hinges.<br />Positives....the metal tripod attachment on base..NO silly docking stations. A \"real\" viewfinder .... easy & small battery charger that plugs right to your wall outlet...continuous shooting...great video clips....easy to navigate interfacing.<br /><br />After extensively searching for tiny cases.....I was VERY happy with a HARD case I found at Ritz Camera...the Quantaray Hard Shell Camera bag (AMAZON search it) in Navy or blk @ $14.95......it is an ultra compact case that has NO BULK, lightwieght and great protection (if you're like me and bought a small camera & want to keep things small..This is wonderful)....It opens along the top and sides by zipper, it then folds open accordion style (I'll upload a photo)..so it is soooo easy to put your camera in and out. It also has a detachable, adjustable neck strap and a belt slip on the back and an internal webbed pocket that fits my extra battery very comfortably. It should fit all the SD models.<br /><br />This is my perfect case....I don't attach the neck strap....so it fits seamlessly in my purse. Do check it out...I really think you'll like it.<br /><br />IN FOLLOW-UP: 6 months later..I STILL LOVE MY CAMERA..although the prices have come down on this model considerably...at least $50...I actually saw this going for $170 on amazon! (I Paid $230) so with that in mind you can either save more on this great little camera...or splurge up to the SD400 model...of which prices have also come down a bit! Either way....you will have a super little camera. I do a lot of macro closeups...and I'm very happy with what I get for the price!","This little camera has every thing you need, from the high quality pictures to great video ability.","I purchased the Canon SD200 back in June and have taken hundreds of photos with it. With a 1GB memory card, the camera will hold over 600 shots taken in the highest resolution! Images are generally good to outstanding! And the movie mode is a great feature... you'll never miss that special moment with this little camera because you'll probably have it with you all the time (my wife keeps it in her purse!)<br /><br />If you want excellent quality digital snapshots, then this camera is for you. Don't waste your money on higher pixel models since 3.2 megapixels is more than enough for printing 4 x 6 snaphots (and more than adequate for web sharing.) You'll only need higher resolution if you're planning to crop/enlarge the photos or make big prints.<br /><br />I read lots of reports here on Amazon about cracked LCD screens. I'm not sure what's up with that, but my camera has gone from a cold (airconditioned) house to a hot beach many times, has been in my wife's purse (in the optional leather carrying case), and in my pocket many times. I've cleaned the LCD numerous times (gently, of course), and have had no problems. Go figure!<br /><br />I give this camera a big \"thumbs up\" for quality and workmanship... and for size! My only word of caution is this: Make SURE that you use the wrist strap!! This camera is so small that it's easy to drop! And, I highly recommend the optional leather carrying case with magnetic clasp available from Canon.","Bought this from another retailer in another color.  It's biggest obvious drawback is the lack of digital zoom.  Other than that, for an amateur, the pictures can be taken at very high quality.  I replaced the 32 mb SD card with a 256 mb card and have an amazing amount of picture storage inherent in the camera.  The battery charger is also nearly as compact as the camera itself.  The cameria comes with a neat carrying case that can protect it as it jostles about in your purse.<br /><br />It's features are very easy to use, and it is quick to turn on and off.  It's size makes it a little difficult for those of us with shakey hands, so you need to pay attention to how you are holding it in order to keep your pictures from being blurred.  However, the size can be advantage as pulling it out, turning the flash off, and taking a few quick pictures without being noticed.  Had a few problems with others unfamiliar with it trying to quickly push the picture button rather than press and hold it and therefore some pictures did not got taken, but it is very nice as a small, compact, and fairly high quality camera even for those amateurs exploring the world of more serious photography.","I just needed a camera that was small, easy to use, and took good pictures.  This camera fit the bill perfectly.  I have had my camera now for 8 months and cannot find anything that I don't like about it.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera to anyone!!","I have this camera for 6 month now. It has been working great. I now leave my Olympus \"almost full size\" 4 MP Digital camera (forgot the model name) at home and use this little one. The Olympus does have better picture quality (my opinion), but the SD200 is not too far from that. The reason I bought the SD200 is the size and acceptable picture quality. You can find a few detail reviews on the Internet.<br /><br />The movie capture function is great. If you are going to use this feature a lot, I suggest using a 1GB memory card.<br /><br />I did find that I was not able to put date/time stamp on the picture, but realized that this feature is only available when the resolution is set to \"postcard\" (1600x1200). Another inconvenient thing is that I was not able to force the \"flash\" in auto-mode, but switching between auto and manual mode is easy, so I will live with that.","I have bought this camera for my girlfriend. I am very satisfied with its function and slick design, the picture quality is good, the menu are also easy to operate........There is only one problem: it BREAKS EASILY. I fell it on the ground carelessly (only from 1 foot high) and I got a dent near the arrow button area. All arrow buttons screwed up after that: RIGHT key lost its fuction sometimes, DOWN becomes LEFT, while LEFT becomes DOWN sometimes (totally unpredictable), DELETE key also become irresponsive, although it's far from the dent. I admit I am a dropper, but I have never seen an electronic device screwed up so easily....Now I can only use it in a weird way, no picture review, no deletion, other functions related to LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT are also hard to use or totally lost....","For a ultra-compact camera the SD200 takes very clear pictures, and is targeted for low end users who take mostly point-and-shoot images to be printed in 4x6 or 5x7.<br /><br />While in Auto-mode, the camera will take care of everything, evaluating light, contrast and focus in 9 zones. It will decide the best possible settings and take the picture.<br /><br />It is a fast camera. It turns on and is ready to take pictures in only 1.4 seconds and takes about 0.5 seconds to focus and shoot. It can also take 2.8 pictures per second if you use the correct SD memory (Sandisk Ultra II will do).<br /><br />Talking about speed, this little camera can shoot 60fps video. So, when you reproduce it at 30fps you can see a smooth low-motion video (limited to 1 minute). If you shoot video at 30 fps (normal rate) the camera will record until the memory is full, which is about 10 minutes of video with a 1GB memory in 640x480 and 20 minutes in 320x200. Not many cameras can do any of that. The negative point is that you cannot change the zoom while recording video.<br /><br />Even when the flash is powerful for a ultra-compact camera, it will generate dark corners for shoots at 2 or 3 meters.<br /><br />Due to its high density lenses the camera will generate little blur in the corners as well, but you can hardly see that at first view. You need to zoom in the image with the computer to see the effect, so it's not big deal.<br /><br />The camera also has a manual mode, that allows you to change several settings, like ISO speed, white balance, exposure and a few picture effects. It allows you to change the shooter speed to large values (from 1 second up to 15 seconds) great for night shots with tripod; however, it will not allow you to change the shooter for high speed values (too bad). Most you can do is to use the \"pets and kids\" mode to go up to 1/1500 for fast action shoots, but you cannot adjust it in other modes.<br /><br />Tha camera also has a \"digital macro\" mode. Which is basically the \"macro focus\" that you could use in Auto-mode but it turns on the digital zoom as well (even if it is disabled). I don't think I'll ever use this mode since I hate digital zooms, they just make the pictures look bad.<br /><br />The low-battery indicator only appears when you are really out of battery. Perhaps 10 shoots before it dies. There is no way to know if you have, let's say, 50% of battery power.<br /><br />It has some hard to reach features like Focus-Lock, Exposure-Lock and Flash-Lock that need two button combination to enable them, but I guess not that many people uses them anyway.<br /><br />The stitch-assist mode will help you to take panoramic views. It will set a reference with the end of the previous picture so you can know where was your last shot. Once you download the pictures to the computer, the camera's software will take care of the combination.<br /><br />And finally, the battery and memory cover is made of plastic. It looks cheap to me and seems that you need to be careful with it, otherwise you'll break it.<br /><br />So, as I said at the beginning, this is a camera for the casual point-and-shoot user who does not need (or want) manual settings. Pictures are clear and sharp. It weights little and it very easy to carry on, specially if you buy it with the PSC-90 leather case that fits like a glove.","I have watched many people such as friends, family, and others purchase and use different digital cameras.  One day I was at my best friends house in Tacoma, WA, and her daughter stopped by.  She wanted everyone to see her digital camera pictures she had taken while fighting fires in Idaho.  It just so happened that she had a Canon Powershot SD200 Elph.  She seemed to know her way around the camera quite well and she began to show us all the pictures and video clips that she was so proud of.  I have to say that I was absolutly amazed with the steller quality of the pictures and videos taken with the Canon Powershot SD200 Elph.  The colors were perfect as well as the overall picture quality.  However, what really captured my attention was the quality of the videos/movies the camera had taken.  She plugged the camera into a 27 inch television and the quality was close to that of a DVD.  Heck, I was sold already.  Coupled with the excellent sound quality I said to myself that I was going to get that exact camera some day.  Well, I just purchased the camera and it is everything I expected and more. I am having a blast  taking pictures for once in my life. I am absolutely certain that the Canon Elph Powershot Digital Camera is the finest on the market today.  I say this because I have seen many other digital cameras perform, and none that I have seen come close to the performance, qaulity, workmanship, and dependability of the Canon SD Elph series.  One other remark if you don't mind.  I have an older Canon AE1 35mm camera.  I thought that it provided me with extreamly good pictures and dependability over the years always using the automatic setting, but the Canon Elph SD200 actually takes better quality pictures than the Canon AE1.  Now that is saying something.  If I was you, I would not hesitate to purchase a digital camera because they are so easy to use in our computer driven society.  Get a Canon Powershot SD Elph and you won't be sorry in any way, shape, or form.  I can say with 99% certainty that the purchase will be one of the best investments you will ever make. Hey, it's a very cool camera!<br /><br />-M.Kane","I like this camera so much I bought a second one after my first one got stolen. I have other SLR/pro cameras, but take the most shots on this as it's TINY and with me always. It takes great macro shots and has terrific color. The 'night' setting has been fun too. Am surprised to read about others' problems with the LCD -- my cam is always getting thrown around in bags and pockets and never gets a scratch. The only con would be this camera has a few more red-eye issues than others around this size.","I have 2 kids and wanted a camera that I could carry with me that wouldn't be bulky, eat up batteries and had a fast shutter speed. I have had mine a week and have been playing around with it and am so far pleased with my purchase. The camera is small, easy to use, and the larger LCD screen is really nice. I want to mention that I did not purchase this camera with the intent to print my own pictures, I just upload them to my computer and make CD albums and/or sometimes I e-mail them to friends. I did notice one thing that I am not thrilled about - unless there is a lot of lighting the pics are sometimes blurry. For example: OUTDOOR pics when the sun is out turn out GREAT, no blurs or anything and that is with my kids running, but if it's not really sunny you might need to use the flash. INDOOR pics turn out good if there is a LOT of light otherwise you have to use the flash, I took a piture of my ceiling fan on high and w/out the flash it was a tan blur, with the flash on there was absolutely no blur at all - you could see each individual fan blade prefectly. So the flash makes a big difference! I have been leaving it on auto so the camera will use it when it feels it needs to and that seems to be working. Overall it is a good camera for the average user, and for the money its a good deal!!","I bought this camera when the SD300 4.0 MP came out. I was debating between the two and found more reasons to buy this one over the other.<br /><br />1.)Larger LCD screen (trust me, it's MUCH better to be able to see your pictures more clearly without squinting)<br /><br />2.)It was much slimmer and lighter<br /><br />3.)It costed $100 less<br /><br />So why settle for something more when all you want is to take nice, decent pictures? If you're going professional you should look at the S series. But if you want a camera you could carry around (in your shirt pocket!)just to hang out with friends or go on a vacation without having to lugg all this equipment with you, this is the perfect camera. I've had it for about 6 months now (I even dropped it once =I) and it's working perfectly.<br /><br />The only drawback is the little flash circles it makes whenever I take a picture while others are flashing. I don't know if that should be a problem.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's the darnest thing!","Let me begin by saying that Canon makes exceptional digital cameras; the best in the market right now. This is because they have always used high quality components since they began manufacturing digital cameras. This one is no exception.<br /><br />Now that I've sold you on a Canon, which one should you choose?<br /><br />First off, let's see if you really need an SDxxx camera, or would be better suited with a cheaper non ultraportable camera.<br /><br />The SDxxx Series offers several key advantages over less portable models:<br /><br />-Beautiful, sleek design and metallic body will wow anyone who sees it.<br /><br />-Gorgeous 2 inch LCD screens<br /><br />-The excellent Dig!c 2 processor (other Canons only have dig!c 1)<br /><br />-Much better movie mode than previous Canons<br /><br />-Small light, easy pocketability<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some significant drawbacks due to the components Canon had to use to get the camera so small:<br /><br />-Few manual controls.<br /><br />-Pictures are not as sharp as those of similar non ultraportable cameras.<br /><br />-The flash is very close to the lens (lots of redeye problems)<br /><br />-More purple fringing issues than other Canons<br /><br />-Proprietary batteries that are expensive to replace<br /><br />-The LCD is very fragile. Read the SD200 and SD300 reviews to see lots of unhappy people whose LCDs broke. Canon's warranty does NOT cover this either. My suggestion? Buy using a credit card that offers a warranty in addition to the manufacturer's. If your lcd breaks, many CC companies will replace the camera no questions asked!<br /><br />If you don't need the ultra portability and flashy looks of the SD cameras, a slightly larger camera with more features might be right for you. I would highly suggest Canon's A510 or A520 if you don't need an SD model.<br /><br />If you still want an SD model, which one should you choose? The SD200 with 3.2mp, the SD300 with 4mp, the SD400 with 5mp, or the SD500 at a whopping 7.1mp?<br /><br />Your first instinct may be that more megapixels is better. Today, however megapixel ratings are similar to Ghz ratings in the computer world: They used to mean a lot, but they don't mean as much anymore. More megapixels do NOT mean a better image. They mean a larger printable image. Unless you have to have huge prints, you simply do not more megapixels. In fact, the 3.2mp of the SD200 is enough for anyone who doesn't plan on printing pictures larger than a standard 8.5x11 sheet of paper.<br /><br />That having been said, there are some differences between each SDxxx model. In order to get the larger 7.1mp sensor in the SD500, Canon had to make the camera larger. Thus, it is around a quarter inch thicker and 30% heavier than the other 3 models. The larger size did enable Canon to pack more features into it, however:<br /><br />Features unique to the SD500:<br /><br />-1/4 inch thicker<br /><br />-30% heavier<br /><br />-50% longer flash range<br /><br />-14% more battery life<br /><br />The SD400 and SD500 also share these benefits over the SD200/SD300:<br /><br />-New \"Night Display\" feature which brightens the LCD in low light<br /><br />-My Colors feature lets you highlight or swap colors right on the camera<br /><br />-USB 2.0 High Speed support<br /><br />The following are shared by all the SDxxx Cameras:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Beautiful, eye catching design<br /><br />-Great image quality, though not as good as non ultraportable models<br /><br />-New Dig!c 2 image processor<br /><br />-Excellent Movie Mode<br /><br />-3x optical zoom is adequate for most people<br /><br />-Excellent, intuitive manual controls<br /><br />-Huge 2.0 inch lcd that looks great under various lighting conditions<br /><br />-Uses widely available and cheap SD cards<br /><br />Cons (most of these are minor quirks):<br /><br />-Some purple fringing problems<br /><br />-Proprietary batteries are expensive to replace and inconvenient at times<br /><br />-Lots of issues with fragile LCDs<br /><br />-No RAW support<br /><br />-Few manual controls<br /><br />If you do choose this product, the first thing you should buy is a larger SD memory card. The camera comes with a 16mb card (32 in the SD500), which is pretty much useless.<br /><br />You should also immediately purchase a case and some screen protectors to protect the LCD.","I had it for less than 2 months and the screen was cracked. I've owned an S200 for years without any problems and I switched to SD200 for the movie mode. Many people have the same experience with the LCD screen and it seems to have something to do with the cold weather. I was told that Canon refused to repair them, so I don't know if a class action lawsuit is on the way. I loved this camera when it lasted. Movie mode was fantastic.","I bought this camera just over a week ago, and am dually impressed. I apologize in advance- it's my first digital camera I've owned or dealt with so I can't compare to any others out there.<br /><br />That said, here's a break down of the pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros: small, pocket size. Lithium battery is fully recharged in 90 minutes. Lasts for a couple hours on full battery charge which I think is a lot. It has a 2 inch LCD display which is great if you don't have the best vision in the world (I don't). It also is fairly simple to figure out how to use - just pick up the camera and after fiddling for 5 minutes, you've pretty much got a thorough understanding on how to work it. It also has a nice zoom feature and comes with great software. Oh, and it's ability to pick up small detail is amazing!<br /><br />Cons: Doesn't come with a camera bag. The camera itself is made out of metal but there is a cheap plastic cover where the usb cable goes and also where the auxillary cables plug into that I am fairly sure if I am not super careful might  break in time. The pictures also have a lot of red eye but it's my understanding that is common with digital cameras so maybe that's not such a big deal.<br /><br />Overall: highly recommend this snazzy little camera! It's great for a beginner such as myself!","I've had the Canon SD-200 for 3 weeks so far and I love it!  Especially the 640x480 movie mode at 30 frames per second.  It's movie mode is the best out there.  The quality is very good, especially in good light.  In good light, it's almost as good as an inexpensive DV camcorder.<br /><br />In the past, I've missed taking so many pictures and movies because one gets tired of dragging along a big digital camera and/or a big camcorder.  But now, since the SD-200 is SO SMALL I am much more likely to have it with me and therefore have pictures and movies I would never have.  I already have some priceless videos.<br /><br />For those who have never seen digital camera's movies, it's just as easy as the pictures.  You connect your camera to the computer and the movies are transfered over just like the pictures are.  Then you double click on the movie thumbnail and watch the movie.  You can't get any easier than that.<br /><br />The nice thing about the canon cameras is their movie mode is AVI (as opposed to MPEG-4 or MPEG) and my movie software, Pinnacle Studio has no trouble importing it, editing it, and then making DVDs with it.<br /><br />The downside to having the best quality movie mode is that the movies are huge.  Around 115 meg a minute.  I got a 1 gig card on sale for $70 yet it holds only 8.5 minutes.  BUT, for me, I'm very glad Canon choose this way because I would MUCH rather have this great quality with it's large file size than the other choice of poorer quality movies.  I'm also discovering a side benefit to having only 8.5 minutes, I'm shooting shorter video segments.  Which means I'm more likely to watch them.<br /><br />The big difference between a camcorder and the vast majority of digital cameras (including the SD-200) is that you can NOT zoom while shooting a movie.  You can zoom before you start the movie, but NOT during shotting the movie.  Again, this is a trade off I can live with, since I'll at least have the movie, as opposed to not having the movie because I didn't take my camcorder because it's too big.<br /><br />Canon told me I only need to get the ordinary SD cards, I don't need the more expensive high speed ones and my normal speed SD memory card is working fine.<br /><br />I got the cheapest SD model, the SD-200, because I believe there will continue to be rapid improvements in the movie mode and therefore will probably get a new one in 2 years.  Also, I THINK the movie quality is the same between all of the SD models.","What encouraged me to write about this camera was my own camera messing up.  I've owned it for a mere 2 months and there's already an internal error (E18, something with the shutter, so Canon tells me..because the lens will not retract back into the camera anymore) that I have to have Canon fix, after I pay money to have it sent in, of course.  I read this happening in a review for the camera when I was doing research on the camera, but only one customer complained about it.  So I kind of assumed it rarely happened.  I have yet to send in the camera, but they better fix it when I send it in, and it better never happen again.<br /><br />But on another note. Prior to this malfunction, the camera was fairly decent.<br /><br />1) I love the movie mode.  The sound is great when I play a movie on my computer.  It's necessary to buy a high speed memory card if you're going to record movies at the camera's maximum potential.  I have a regular speed memory card, and it only let's me record ~20 seconds of the top quality video before it automatically stops.  So that sucks, but something CAN be done about it.  You don't REALLY need that top quality anyway, I feel that the next one down, I think it's 15 fps, works just fine.  If I'd do it again, I'd buy a high speed card just so you have that option.<br /><br />2) Night snapshot.  I don't think it works too well.  The lighting usually ends up being blurred, like I moved the camera mid-take - although that is definitely not the case.<br /><br />3)Red eye.  It's inevitable and regardless of whether you have the red eye reduction setting on or not, it doesn't work.  If anything, it just takes longer to take the picture with red eye.<br /><br />4)I don't like the way you take a picture.  I feel like it takes so much longer to take the actual picture.  First you have to let the camera focus (pressing it halfway down) and THEN it will take the picture.  It seems like I have to hold the button down for a few seconds.  I have some people take pics for me, and sometimes they think the camera took the picture, but it was merely the beep of the focusing.  It's not the best for taking spur of the moment pics.  If my friends happen to be doing something funny, sometimes I miss it because the whole focus, then shoot.  I usually find myself holding it halfway down all the time, just so it'll actually take the pic the second I want to take a pic.<br /><br />5) It is a short time between taking the actual pictures though, so that's a plus.  As soon as you take one, the camera is ready to take another.  Definitely a change from my older Fuji FinePix2650, that took at least a few seconds to get ready again.<br /><br />6) It fits well in a jean pocket.  FABULOUS!<br /><br />7) The picture quality is pretty good.  I'm not a professional or anything, so I don't notice purple fringe and stuff. (Heck, I don't even know what that looks like, hah)  The only issues I have about image quality is what I've said in 2, 8 and 13.<br /><br />8) This is kind of a universal thing with cameras, but I don't like the fact that the pictures are usually blurry if you don't use the flash.  I guess it's because the shutter speed or the fact that you have to watch how much you shake when the picture takes.  But I'm sorry, it's hard to NOT move the camera when you have to push down a button.<br /><br />9) Someone mentioned having an issue with not having a place to put their thumb while taking pictures.  I, a 19 yr old female, don't seem to have that problem.<br /><br />10) The LCD does seem to be semi-fragile.  I think I'm noticing a small scratch on mine. :(<br /><br />11) The battery life is decent.  The only thing I wish that the camera had was a battery meter.  Just so I knew when I was halfway through, etc.  Instead, a low battery symbol flashes about 5-10 pics before it's dead.  A second battery pack is prob a good idea.<br /><br />12) I think they should use a different form of power.  The battery supposedly only will recharge for so many times.  Then you have to buy a new one, which will set you back about 40 bucks.  Not my idea of fun time.  My first digicam, the Fuji FinePix2650 was good at that.  It used 2 AA's (I used rechargeable) and lasted a good while.<br /><br />13) Distant pictures seem to be semi-blurry.  I just read the other day about an Infinity setting that supposedly is for stuff like that, but because my camera is messed up, I haven't been able to test that out yet.<br /><br />14) I love that it comes with cords to connect to your TV.  I think that's so cool that you can run a slideshow of the pics on your tv.<br /><br />15) The AF-assist beam is a great thing.  I can take pics in the dark because it shines a light at the center of the pic, so I can quickly aim in the right direction.<br /><br />SOrry about this review being so long.  I was just trying to evenly get the positives and negatives, and I know that if I were you, I would want to know everything and anything about something I'm about to put a good amount of money towards.","This is my first digital camera, and I did ALOT of research before buying. I knew exactly what I wanted: 3x optical zoom, unlimited continous recording WITH SOUND (you wouldn't believe how dificult it is to find this feature) all in a sleek compact body. And I wanted all this with a brand I could trust. The camera was smaller than I expected, but once I became familiar with it, I was completely comfortable handling it. The software was easy to install and the directions were easy to follow. All in all I LOVE THIS CAMERA. I love this video clips I've taken, the sound is incredible. The pictures are wonderful! The battery life is good (but I wouldn't know what to compare it to), but I would say it lasted me about a 1.5-2 days of shooting pics throught the day (I'm not sure what it should last, but 1.5-2 days batt life is pretty good to me). Last but not least, the most wonderful feature is the LCD screen 2\"!!!!! Wow! I love it. I'm spoiled (I can't tolerate the small 1.5 LCD screens on my friends' cameras.)<br /><br />I'm not an expert, but the pics and videos are wonderful, the sound is incredible, the batt life is good, and its an easy to manage camera. And for those who need more, it has many shooting modes and functions (I'm still getting to know them myself and I've had the camera for 3 mos now). If you just want a really good quality camera, with exceptional features in a sleek compact body, I say, invest in this one. I'm more than happy with it.","I am very happy with this camera due to it's small size and several different shooting modes. However I noticed that in low light conditions if you do not use the flash the pictures are somewhat blurry, even if you change the settings around. It appears that the camera needs the flash to focus properly. Red-eye is a major problem with this camera even with the red-eye reduction shooting mode. So be prepared to fix a lot of red-eyes out of your pictures.<br /><br />Also my LCD cracked for no apparent reason. I took the camera out of it's case to take a picture and the LCD was white with a purple blob in the center. I was unable to view anything on the LCD or even change the settings. I mailed the camera back to Canon for repairs, which takes about 3 weeks and as you can imagine it is not covered under warranty. The cost for the repair is close to $200. I did some research on the internet and found that this is a common problem. I really like the SD300 but am rather unhappy with the LCD repair costs and problems.","I have had this camera for over 2 weeks and I am very happy with it.<br /><br />Aside from disposables, this is the first camera I have purchased.  I also bought the SD200 Accessory Kit--Which contains the the PSC-90 Deluxe Leather Case and the NB-4L Lithium-ion battery pack--and a 512mb Sandisk Ultra II card.<br /><br />Before buying this camera I was worried about its \"fragile\" two-inch screen.  So I went to Best Buy to test its durability myself.  After a couple of hard wacks with my finger and other random tests I was satisfied.  (I ended up purchasing this camera online very cheaply from a company listed on pricegrabber.)<br /><br />I carry this camera in my pants pocket everyday and haven't had a problem.  The key factor is keeping it in the PSC-90 case since its stiff back is designed to protect the LCD screen.  I suspect if you use a softcase from another company (i.e. Case Logic) then there's the potential of damaging the screen.  Aside from rattling in my pocket with my cell phone this camera has been  leaned on while reaching over a counter and hit it against with a bag I was carrying.  The screen is still in perfect condition.<br /><br />I take pictures for business purposes: store prices, the inside of a car I was interested in purchasing, and eBay.  Its speed also makes it a good social camera.  The DIGIC II processor matched with a Sandisk Ultra II is unbelievably fast and well worth the extra dollars.<br /><br />Battery life is exceptional.  In one day I took over 150 pics w/flash and the battery is still running.  A good trick to prolong its life is to change the Power Saving setting so that the LCD display turns off after 10 or 20 seconds after not being in use.  When you are ready to take another picture press the shutter button half way down.  The LCD will pop back on with your subject in focus.  I also turn the brightness level to the minimum--which is still bright--to save power.<br /><br />The last thing I would like to impress upon is its intuitive button layout. Everything can be managed with one hand unlike older Canon cameras where many of the function buttons reside under the LCD screen.  Here, all the buttons are on the right side making it a breeze to navigate.<br /><br />I can go on raving about photo quality, the easy user interface, and its compactness, but I'll leave that to other reviewers.  Coming from someone who was using disposables this camera is the ultimate point and shoot.  Other cameras I considered were the Sony W1 and V1, Fuji FinePix, Casio Elixim, and Canon A95, S500, SD110, S410.  The SD200 does what is advertised at a great cost.  I am very satisfied with this product.","I love this camera.  It is tiny, fantastic, takes great photos, movies with sound, etc.  I am very satisfied with this elph.","Canon seems to be light years ahead of their competition when it comes to important things like the look and feel of their products. The SD200 is no different. This is your basic slip-it-in-your-pocket (or purse) point and shoot camera. Perfect for making 4X6 prints or for e-mailing pictures to your buds. The 3.2 MP chip seems small these days but Canon installed the new DIGIC II chip and to my eyes, the new hardware and software deliver crisp, clear prints and on-monitor images. Despite the small size of the camera, the screen is big and clear. (That's what first caught my attention).  The 3X zoom is another surprise in such a compact package. (That's what sold me on this camera.) I have big hands but I found the camera simple to operate. In fact, since I am very familiar with Canon products, I did not have to crack the manual to get started making pictures.  I wasn't happy that none of my Compact Flash cards and other Canon batteries work in this smaller camera. I guess that's the price of progress.<br />I have not experienced any purple color fringe effects but a friend with another Canon showed me examples so I know it can happen. Since I'm not making Ansel Adams images with this small camera, I'm not worried. That may not be true for you so make sure wherever you buy, you can return it if you are not pleased with the results. For me, mine is a keeper - it's been a reliable and fun addition to the camera collection.","I'm loving this camera. Some great reviews listed here. Though, someone said you could fit it inside of an Altoids tin. I have tried, but it just won't fit. Even after some modifications to the tin with some needle-nose plyers. I could possibly force it in, but not sure if I'd ever get it out and would most probably scratch the thing up in the process. So, no go. This is kind of a bummer because it really looks like it should fit, and would be really great if it did. Durable, incognito, cheap. A great and easy case for your SD200. If somebody knows how to get this to work, please share.","Canon has made a handy camera. It's small, compact and most of all, it's easy to use. Another good thing is the view screen. It's big compared to other camera. It's easy to upload the pictures and it's easy to shoot. A great camera for the casual photo taker.","This camera takes nice pictures and has a lot of features.  For the price its much better than the Sony.  The 2inch display in the back looks awesome and is very useful for adjusting the light meter and some of the more subtle imaging options.","I lugged a Kodak DC4800 around for several years and decided it was time to upgrade.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Picture quality is great.<br />+ indoor/flash pictures are MUCH better than my old DC4800.<br />+ with fast SD card, you can take pictures over and over and over and over... without stopping (at a little more than 2 pictures a second.)<br />+ ditto for movie mode.  you can take as long a movie as you have SD card space (@ 15, 30 fps)  this is the big strike against the S410/S500 for me.  i can get ~4.25 minutes on 512MB card @ 30 fps, 640x480.  (get bigger SD cards!!!)<br />+ tri-pod mount is centered on the lens, not the camera body.  (though it does look ridiculous putting such a small camera on a tripod :-)<br />+ you can view 9 pictures at once in review mode<br />+ you can't beat the ELPH's styling.  :-)  very solid construction.<br /><br />Bleh:<br />+/- you can argue over the resolution if you print 8x10s.  i think 2MP is fine for viewing on computer screens and printing 4x6 photos.  so 3MP should be fine for most folks.<br />+/- Camera will rotate pictures 90 degrees automatically.  HOWEVER, you have to use Canon software to preserve the rotation.  When I transfer via PTP in Windows, I lose the rotation.<br />+/- you can use the zoom to take videos.  however, you can't change the zoom while you are recording video.  for example, if you use 3x zoom to take a video, the whole clip stays @ 3x.<br />+/- you can edit the video on the camera, but i haven't completely figured out the interface yet...<br /><br />Negative:<br />- Manual controls limited.  Can't choose aperture, or short exposure time.  You can select long exposure times (1-15 seconds)<br />- Noticeable lag between hitting the shoot button to when the camera actually takes the picture.  Not recommended for \"action\" shots.<br />- Video mode does not rotate 90 degrees.  If you rotate your camera while taking videos, be prepared to rotate your head when viewing it on your monitor!<br />- gotta get another canon battery for those long backpacking trips.<br /><br />--- update<br /><br />For $170, this is a great camera for the money.","I recently bought the Canon SD200 and boy is it SMALL!!! Take an Altoids box and this camera will fit right in it. It is ultra light and compact and absolutely handsome because of its steel body (mind you though that all metal bodied cameras get scratched easily...so I recommend buying a small pouch for it..samsonite has a really neat one with a hook and belt strap that fits this camera perfectly for around 4$). This camera will fit in your pant pockets and you will not feel its presence at all (kind of bad because you tend to forget you have a camera at your disposal for those picture perfect moments).<br /><br />The performance of the camera kind of took a second priority in my selection of the camera. However after saying that, the Canon SD200 is the best in its class when it comes to pictures. It won't be as good as the bigger bulkier cameras with wider apertures. I kind of figured that I am no photography connoisseur and after researching a lot I concluded that for amateurs like me this camera is superior by all picture standards in its class. After using this camera I feel that it does a great job and that my research sources prior to buying the camera were accurate in that.<br /><br />Before I go into details something I must mention is the 2\" LCD screen. It is absolutely gorgeous and has around 200,000 pixels giving you one of the best LCD pictures you will see on any digital camera. As for the features you can read up all the other reviews and also look online. My favorite feature though is the movie mode. It records video with sound until your memory card fills up. That means that unlike all the Canon predecessors this one has no video clip time limit. That is a good move by Canon and it pays off especially when you can take fast frame rate movies (60 frames per second) for fast moving action like from a moving car or a pet moving fast. No other ultra-compact camera and maybe even most of the compact cameras come even close to the quality of the video taken by this camera. So get yourself a 512Mb SD card and you can take approximately 6 minutes and 11 seconds of great video. Ofcourse, you can go to the 30fps mode and take double the amount of video time though quality is good but not something to rave about.<br /><br />This camera does a good job for night shots and also against glares, for example where there is a window behind the subject to be photographed and it is sunny outside. The camera has many features that you can manually control. Of course experts would like more control of the camera than the ones offered but hey if you want a manual camera get a film SLR. Those are much cheaper and much better than modern day digital cameras. Good luck to those experts hanging them around their necks while people like me stroll with the small digital ones in our pockets. It is a trade-off and this review is not ment for experts because they obviously know much more than what information this review can provide. This review is meant for people like me who until a month back was completely overwhelmed by the choices around and did not know which one is the best to suit my needs.<br /><br />So here are the kinds of people I think should buy this camera:<br /><br />1. People who care about mobility<br /><br />2. People who don't care that their pictures are perfect (by perfect I mean something that will make photography experts rewrite their will to the camera, had it been a person)<br /><br />3. People who want a bang for their buck (most of us fall in this category), and lastly<br /><br />4. People who have a good 250$ to invest in a great camera<br /><br />The only con of this camera is the rechargeable battery which is around 45$ when the one provided runs out. The good thing though is that the battery lasts 300 recharges and 140 pictures with flash for each charge as per Canon. That being said this camera is the best in its class when it comes to the picture quality taken for its size and weight.<br /><br />A couple of things to be aware of though before buying this camera.<br /><br />1. This camera has a very flimsy battery/SD card cover. Be careful while using it.<br /><br />2. This camera has a tripod mount screw hole right besides the battery/SD card cover so you cannot open the cover with the camera mounted on a tripod.<br /><br />3. This camera will get scratched easily like all metal case cameras do.<br /><br />4. This camera has its flash positioned at a place where it is easy to block it with one of your fingers.<br /><br />5. This camera is so light that it is easy to forget it in your pocket.<br /><br />6. The battery in this camera is meant for 300 recharges. So if you recharge it when it is partly empty then you loose one of your 300 recharges. So only recharge when the low battery light comes on.<br /><br />The 6 points above in my mind are all very minor and can be worked around very easily with a little caution and planning. So I would definitely recommend this camera to any \"novice\" but also advise users about the few things that they have to look out for after buying it.","After doing considerable research, I bought one of these for my 77 year old Dad for Christmas, loved it so much I had to have one of my own.<br /><br />Here are some of the thoughts I would like to add to those that have already been covered:<br /><br />1)  EASE OF USE!  I teach classes on digital photography and using the internet at a local library, which attract a lot of seniors, and even though this baby is small I think it is VERY user-friendly for non-techies to use.  The screen is large and very crisp, the control buttons are intuitive and not teensy, and MUCH easier to use than those on my bigger Canon S30.<br /><br />2)  I don't care if you are a real digi photo nut, and absolutely have to have some feature laden 12x optical zoom camera with digital image stabilization (I currently am swooning over the Panasonic DMC-FZ20K) - you still need a small camera that goes with you EVERYWHERE.  Guys have it real easy, the case fits beautifully on a belt, it also doesn't weigh down the purse I'm cursed to lug around.  I have solved the big powerful, smaller capable camera debate:  you need both.<br /><br />3)  This camera simply takes BETTER PICTURES than my S30 (which cost $500 two years ago).  People's faces just plain look better.  The contrasts aren't so drastic, which caused me no end of problems before.  Before my Mexican son-in-law looked so incorrectly dark, I'd have to lighten him to where my daughter looked like a ghost - but not with this camera.  Skin tones are more realistic and flattering.  My S30 seemed to bring out every flaw on faces like a laser, and I had to spend hours photo editing folks to make them not want to wince when they saw their pictures.<br /><br />4) The camera is FAST - a speed demon compared to my S30.  Fast turning on, fast switching between pictures, fast everything - and that is with a 1 gigabyte ATP high-speed memory card I got so I could take plenty of movies (only cost $92).  I have two fast moving grandsons - in the past the shot would be lost by the time my S30 got cranked up and ready to go.  You turn this one on, and it's ready to shoot instantly.  Grandsons don't stand around waiting for my taken pics to display (\"can I see it, can I see it??\")<br /><br />5) This SD200 matches and even exceeds the incredible performance in low lighting of my S30.  You will NOT find another camera in this size or price range that does better.  A week before buying the SD200, I tried out a $200 Samsung camera - god it was sad.  A picture in my family room with even outside midday light coming in through a doorwall turned out to be nothing but a dark ugly mish-mash.  The Samsung was returned in a jiffy.  You can take this camera into a pitch black room, punch the button, and have a picture that looks like it was taken in FULL room light.  This is what messes up most amateurs' snapshots, dark gloomy pictures.  The autofocus beam kicks, and the flash is very powerful.<br /><br />6) The movie feature makes the camera even more incredibly wonderful.  My S30 had an imposed limit of like 2 minutes - boom, right before the end of my grandson's song, it stopped.  This one can go as long as you have memory - spend the extra for a big fast memory card (I got the ATP 1 gig) because you're gonna want to take lots of movies.  No more dragging a video camera and camera around.  Just beware - you are gonna need a lot more light for videos.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think this is one hot camera that will meet most people's needs wonderfully.  Can't wait to show it off to my classes (too bad I can't earn commission on them!)  Remember on a bigger camera, you will still have to carry it in a camera case, you will still not take it with you unless you plan ahead to drag it along, and then have to worry about who the heck is going to carry it.  Hence, I missed a lot of pictures.  And at a mere $269, you can have a cadillac for a small chunk of bucks.","Ok, a little backstory. In January 2004 I purchased a Canon SD100, it was a fantastic Camera. One night I was using that Camera, and I dropped it on a wine bottle and cracked the LCD(bad luck). It was still under warranty, so I called Canon and I was going to send it in for repair. My father offered to make a copy of the receipt for me, but he lost the original receipt(even worse luck). So the camera was beyond repair, and pretty much unusable...<br /><br />...The point of all this is that I was willing to fork over the amount of Dough this Christmas to buy yet another Elph. I am not the least bit dissapointed in the SD200, it is very similar to my SD100, and superior in many ways as well. Here is a list of the SD200's best assets...<br /><br />1)The 2\" LCD is quite large and it has a very crisp resolution, perfect for veiwing images.<br /><br />2)Unlike most cameras, the SD200 comes with a Li-ion batt, which provides hours of use, most cameras eat AAs like Krispie Kremes.<br /><br />3)The camera is capable of doing 640x480 resolution movies w/ sound, and can do 30 or 60 fps on different resolutions.<br /><br />4) A 3x optical zoom is decent, enough for my needs.<br /><br />5)3.2 Megapixels is enough for up to 8x10's at 35mm quality.<br /><br />Basically you should go buy this Camera. I used my previous Elph all the time, and I have the same intentions for this one. Its small enough it can go anywhere youd take a cell phone or a wallet. Its very capable for its size. Buy it. Stop reading and go.","This is the third digital camera I have bought. The first was a Sony, then a Nikon. The Nikon Coolpix 3200 failed to live upto the Nikon quality. Its main failing is the battery. AA batteries, whatever the type and make, does not cut it when it comes to digital cameras. The Canon SD200 has a rechargable Lithium battery. The camera's night time photography features are excellent. So are the other modes. Another thing I like is the larger display. It is also brighter. Auto focusing is great. The little squares come out to help quickly in the view. The MPEG feature is also very good. Overall, I love this camera. I was planning on buying the Sony L1 but it never came out on time. Now I do not regret buying the Canon. I liked this camera so much that I bought a Canon Digital Camcorder too. The Optura 40. I had a Sony 8mm that has stopped working. I was going to buy the HC85.<br /><br />I recommend Canon cameras to all.","SD200 is the latest Elph from Canon. It is slimmer and loaded with more features than ever before.<br /><br />Pro's,<br /><br />1. Good picture quality for a super-compact camera.<br /><br />2. Priced right.<br /><br />3. Excellent feature set.<br /><br />4. Large LCD screen.<br /><br />5. Cool metallic body.<br /><br />6. Excellent package including a smart world charger.<br /><br />7. Uses industry standard SD cards, not propreitary memory sticks or xD.<br /><br />8. 3MP and 3x zoom is the right combination for most people. Any more MP would a waste of money.<br /><br />9. Intuitive interface and solid build quality.<br /><br />Con's,<br /><br />1. No manual controls yet on Elph.<br /><br />2. Awkward to hold compared to older Elph's (No place put your right thumb when taking pics).<br /><br />3. Battery life is below average.<br /><br />4. Another costly & propreitary battery from Canon.<br /><br />Its hard to get very exicted about the latest Elph if you already own one, there isn't much new. However if you are looking for your first, the SD200 is an excellent choice.","I had an older digital elph I bought in 2000. Its been a good camera (and still is) but didn't have the ability to take videos, something I really wanted now we have a kid.<br /><br />I like photography, so I was initially looking for something that had manual controls, plus took vidoes. I was looking at the Canon G6 and the Sony DSCV3. Both great cameras, but what changed my mind was the portability factor. The SD200 will slip in your shirt pocket, the other two won't.<br /><br />Sure, I've not got full manual control, but the portability factor won me over. Also the SD200 has a far better movie mode than the G6. (It used Canon's new DIGIC2 processor, only seen so far on its really expensive cameras)<br /><br />Image quality is *great* as is the battery life. Quality may not be like the G6, but you won't notice if your only printing 6x4 or looking at them on your screen<br /><br />Don't let the 3.2 megapixel worry you, its fine for 6x4. If your looking at this or the more expensive sd300, get this one. the slightly higher res is not worth $120., for the extra $120, buy a *really* big memory card and a extra battery.<br /><br />Can't seem to get your kids smiling ?, with this camera, just set it in continious mode and hold the button down. over 2 shots per second! until you fill the memory card ! Your bound to get at least one with your kids smiling.<br /><br />Thinking about the Sony T1 ? Its great too, but this is far cheaper, just as small and the memory cards are cheaper also, and remember 3.2 megapixels are ample for 6x4 prints.","Everything that a non-professional can ask for has been packed into this little miracle.<br /><br />I ve been on the hunt for a digital camera for the past 4 months and have been researching the SD200 for the past 2 months. I considered a lot of factors, such as price, electronics, optics, digital noise, video capabilities and size.<br /><br />This camera has satisfied all the items on my checklist.<br /><br />There are many shooting modes and also functions that allow you to modify light, shutter speed , etc... Hence you end up with many combinations that is sure to give you the quality of shooting  most likely any situation demands.<br /><br />Canon has been able to bring together the optics and electronics in digital cams very well. SD 200 is a result of this progress.<br /><br />One major improvement is that this thing can record AVI movies as long as memory remains. There are 3 video shooting modes and unlike other cams where there is a time limit, one of the video modes (the standart one) has no time limit.<br /><br />The body feels solid, and dont worry about carrying it in your side pocket. As long as there are no other items in the same pocket, dont worry about the 2\" screen being damaged either.<br /><br />Battery life is good. It lasts for all-day-long trips. For longer periods a second battery would help. It takes 2 hours to charge.<br /><br />Things I did not like :<br /><br />The switch for shifting between movie , pic and review modes is plastic and is not \"flush\" with the body of the camera. It protrudes and it becomes a bit shaky, which is not the kind of thing you want to see on a camera of this quality.<br /><br />The software is cumbersome. I'd rather have a direct plug and play version, where i can transfer my images like from any other storage device. Having to go through a software is not appreciated.<br /><br />SD200 vs. SD300 , i'd say go for SD200 .<br /><br />There is about $120 price difference. So spent that money on things that matter such a larger memory card (definite need) and an extra battery.","Canon's newer, higher end SD models (SD200/SD300) are fantastic little cameras for point-n-shooters like myself.<br /><br />What's new compared to SD110/S410/S500:<br /><br />-2.0\" LCD as opposed to 1.5\" on other canon models<br /><br />-Low-light focus system dramatically improved over previous canon ultracompacts<br /><br />-Built in scene modes, making it much easier for those illiterate in manual functions (white balance?  huh?) to get better looking pictures.<br /><br />Pros (aside from new features mentioned above):<br /><br />-Canon's image sensor is consistently one of the (if not THE) best when it comes to ultracompact digital cameras.  Compare pictures taken by a Canon ultracompact to any other brand of ultracompact at the same resolution and the difference is remarkable.<br /><br />-All metal body feels sturdy.<br /><br />-Controls are mapped very efficiently (zoom and shutter operatable with one hand).  Menus can be navigated easily.<br /><br />-Numerous shooting options are enough to satisfy amateur photographers as well as snapshooters.  Auto-mode is efficient and usually does a good job.<br /><br />-About 2/3 the thickness of the S-series of Canon cameras, which are already about the size of a pack of cigarettes.<br /><br />-3.2 Megapixel sensor is exactly enough for snapshooters, which ultimately makes this camera cost far less.<br /><br />-Automatic lens cover prevents dust, etc., from marring lens.<br /><br />-Canon switched from Compact Flash memory to SD memory, which reads and writes much faster.<br /><br />-Fast start-up time (although not as fast as Casio's Exilim line).<br /><br />-Sleek design makes the camera a fashion statement.  You can and WILL get \"oooh\"s and \"ahhh\"s from people when you pull this thing out.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Canon switched from Compact Flash memory to SD memory, which costs more.<br /><br />-3.2 megapixel resolution, while enough to print 5x7s, usually isn't enough to print 8x10 images with anything resembling decent resolution.  Luckily, 90% of home users will never need more.<br /><br />-This camera is clearly not for anyone other than casual snapshooters: lacking in the manual functions more experienced photographers demand.<br /><br />-No RAW file mode for experienced digital photographers.<br /><br />-Basically, experienced photographers will hate this camera.  But thankfully, it's not geared toward them, but rather at home-users.  If you are an experienced photographer, don't look at ultra compact snapshooter cameras.  Go for digital SLR cameras, like Canon's EOS or Digital Rebel series'."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot SD300 (Digital IXUS 40 / IXY Digital 50)","amazon_reviews":["I've had this thing for over ten years.

However, and this is entirely my fault, over the years, I haven't always used the best protection that I could have for my camera, thus resulting in some obvious LCD scratches. But I put that blame on myself, not the product itself.<br /><br />This camera has definitely taken some sharp, vivid, and beautiful pictures over the years. Even my professional photography family members acclaim some of my pictures. And here you thought it was JUST a snapshot camera...<br /><br />The compact size is great, and I always continue to find amusing places where this camera can fit: jean pockets, cell phone cases, my polo shirt's little itsy bitsy pocket, ...<br /><br />The thing that bugs the heck out of me is that, right after I had bought this, like a month or two later, newer and supposedly better models of the PowerShot line started coming out. I bought this baby for $400 dollars, so you imagine my dismay. Regardless, I'm not feeling regretful all too much because this is quite the well-made product.<br /><br />The one con (of the very few) that I can think of about this product is that, over time, my camera (when the lens would retract itself) a noise that I'm sure didn't appear before now does. I don't know if it's the product, or if it was just those times that I brought this baby to the beach only to have sand kick at it, but yeah, just an observation.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I also find myself charging the battery for this camera MUCH more often now. I don't know if age, wear and tear, or whatever has to do with anything, but charging this camera before some event is a MUST for me. Always.<br /><br />But, in conclusion, it's a great camera and I'm truly surprised to see this older model of Canon PowerShot have such great (overrall) ratings considering the newer, edgier, and cooler models now and days.<br /><br />I think I'll be sticking with this camera for awhile, maybe wait for Canon to come up with something new(er) in their PowerShot line or whatever.","I got this camera about 2 years ago because my sd 200 broke. It is soooo easy to use and takes great pictures. Its also very sleek and small.","I bought this last year ago after my wife raved about hers. It has lived up to the Canon name and takes excellent pictures. I haven't taken the time yet to figure it all out but even the movie option is great. I love the camera and the low price I paid.","I have been a digital camera owner since the 640x480 days when digi cams were the size of bricks, and now i have one that's small as a deck of cards...the sd300.  i've had it for almost a year now, and it keeps on kicking.  I read all of the reviews about the cracked LCD screens and all, but i took my chances anyways...and quite frankly, the screen itself has taken a beating from me, it's all scratched up from being in my pocket, banging around with my keys and coins, etc.  i applied a thin screen protector and it fixes the cosmetic blemishes (and added scratch glare from sunlight) due to the scratches.  picture quality is awesome, i've made large prints at costco and they look immaculate.  I use a 512MB SD card which is able to hold around 200 pictures in \"superfine\" 4.0 megapixel mode (there are 3 modes for each of the 4 available resolutions; coarse, fine, and superfine).<br /><br />it is durable too, i've dropped it numerous times, and it still works beautifully.  the metal casing doesn't only look good, it truly serves its purpose in protecting the camera's vital internal components.<br /><br />I don't see myself buying another camera for a long time as i usually make 4x6 to 8x10 prints, which come out great from the images taken with this camera.  the size adds even more incentive for one to buy this camera or any from the powershot SD series, it allows one to easily slip it into their pocket or purse.  one can then whip it out, power it up, and be ready to snap a photo in under 9 seconds...seriously.  the power-up and load time is extremely fast, even faster if you buy an SD card with a faster write capability.<br /><br />Also, i was able to purchase extra nb-4l batteries for this camera from pricegrabber.com for only $4.99 a piece, can't beat that.<br /><br />i'd give this camera a 6 star rating if i could =)","ditto....lcd cracked for no apparent reason<br /><br />sent it to canon in illinois<br /><br />awaiting outcome on repair<br /><br />good overall camera, but no low battery signal","I had this camera for one whole year. It was great. This camera take beautiful pictures and is so easy to operate. Its size makes it so easy to carry around.<br /><br />However, while looking for cameras last year i came upon this one. Many reviews talked about cracking LCD screens. I ignored these reviews thinking it wouldnt happen to me. I was wrong. I was taking pictures one day of my car. Not even 15 m inutes later i took it back out of the case to put my pictures on the computer, and the screen was cracked. As far as i know, nothing happened that would make it crack. Its such a dissapointment, and i dont think i will be able to get it fixed through my insurance. A big disappointment. However, it was a GREAT camera while it lasted.","i've had my camera for almost 2 years now. it's great. i haven't had any problems with it, no lcd cracking or the purple stuff. i have dropped my camera before, from i would say about 4ft+ onto the cement and it barely left a dent, and it still works as good as new. the picture quality is awesome and also the video feature is really good. i love it. but the ONE con is that there is no battery indicator thing, it only blinks low battery when it's about to die, but the pros about this camera definitely weighs out that one con.<br /><br />ALSO, from a few of the reviews i have read, some people said that you'd have to take extremely good care of this camera because it's really sensitive. but honestly, i haven't been taking care of my camera. i don't carry it in a case and i always either have it in the back pocket of my pants or in my purse or i'll just hold it in my hand and actually it's been banged around a couple of times, but i hardly have any scratches on it except the tiny dent from that one time i dropped it.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />durable<br /><br />small<br /><br />lcd screen is huge<br /><br />it doesn't lag<br /><br />it's cute<br /><br />excellent picture/video quality<br /><br />long battery life<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />no battery indicator<br /><br />i DEFINITELY reccomend this camera to everyone :).","My wife and I bought this camera about 6 months ago as an upgrade to an aging kodak 2mb. I am pretty much a \"automatic settings\" guy whereas my wife loves to use manual settings, change ISO, shutter speed etc. This camera is perfect for both of us and the picture quality is amazing.<br /><br />I was somewhat sceptical on reading other reviews on the display cracking but, fingers crossed, have not had any problems. The movie feature is very very impressive, and on the highest quality is good enough for transfer to DVD. Would advise you to get a 1gb ultra fast card to really benefit from the cameras features.<br /><br />Only complaints are that the software that comes with the camera for image editing is terribly outdated and looks like something to be used on windows 3.1 and the transfer via the cable is quite fiddly leaving you to wonder if the door to the usb cable socket on the camera would break over use. We bought a universal SD card reader and take the card out itself and then transfer to the pc.<br /><br />There is no battery indicator which is ridiculous. Suddenly the camera says \"low battery\" and then shuts off. Get yourself another battery as a spare. Whoever left this feature of the camera at Canon should be fired.<br /><br />Download the free picasa image software. Much better than adobe photo album and the canon software included in the box.","Ironically enough, my camera was also stolen like the previous reviewer. It devastated me to lose my SD300 because it's by far the best camera I've ever used. Macro pics come out very clear and it's very hard to get blurry shots with this camera. The size is perfect. It will fit in my back pocket. My little cousins loved using it because it's so easy to take pictures. Lag time is practically non-existant. Battery life is incredible! I'm buying another one. I've researched other brands just for researching sake, and nothing compares to this camera. It's close to perfect.","I loved this camera (past tense because mine was recently stolen). I will only buy canon cameras after owning this. Takes great pictures, super small, and plenty of features.<br /><br />I am now looking into buying the new sd450 that is replacing it.","One of my best buys ever. This camera is so sleek and easy to use yet is small in size. Atleast 5 friends bought this camera after seeing mine.","Pretty good digital camera for basic point-and-shoot and family/party photographs. It is small and cute, but equally fragile  .<br /><br />Expect a large drop in picture quality when the flash is removed.","Bought this camera to downsize from out Olympus 3000. We do a lot of outdoor activities and wanted a smaller camera to take with us. Wow what a great choice. Takes excellent outdoor pictures. Took moving pictures of my girls first mountain bike ride. We were surprised at the clarity. Camera is simple to use. We use mostly the point and shoot functions. Downloading pictures is a snap through the supplied USB cable. The supplied 16mb card is too small so we upgraded to a 256mb card. When we saw how good the movies were we went 1gb. We recommend.","Absolutely love this camera.  Even takes good pictures at night when you use a tripod with it.  It's small enough to take with you everywhere.  Pictures inside are a bit fuzzy on the auto mode.  Other than that I have no gripes.","This is an awesome camera, i bought it for graduation and loved it. Little did i know i was going to get into photography so much using the camera, so i just recently sold it to get the SD 550. I say get this camera if your just beginning in photography or if you just like to take pictures, this to me is the best 4.0 mega pixel camera out.","I just wanted to say that I've had this camera for over 6 months now and it is great. I love it. I wasn't really looking for a camera THIS small but im so glad i got it because i take it everywhere and it has come in SOOO handy to have it be so small. I got pictures at events i normally wouldn't have brought a camera to if it was any bigger (like being out in the woods all day, i could just clip it to my belt loop)<br /><br />I have had NO problem with the LCD screen and if it is a concern for you (as it was for me before i bought it) buy it from a place that offers a good warrenty (Ritz camera covers everything except fire damage, you can drop it right in front of them and they'll fix or replace it- $60 / year)<br /><br />Only real complaint is a) red eye, but i knew i was going to ahve to live with that. Not as bad if i use the zoom which brings the lense farther away from the flash b) bad focusing in low light, the camera will really hunt for a focus and that shot that you wanted to take might have passed by at that point- or it will be blury. but again, thats the same for most compact cameras and c)no battery indicator (buy an extra battery!)<br /><br />if you have any questions about this camera feel free to email me Ruffian829@aim.com","Before the LCD screen gave way, this was a very nice camera. The screen breaking my have been my fault, because i take every ware with me, like snowboarding in CO. and to the beach in bermuda. it had nice features and was extremly small and compact. When snowboarding i kept it in my jacket pocket and you couldnt even fell it.  It seems that im not the only one with an LCD problem if you just google SD300 LCD you will see some other complaints.","I seem to be among the many unlucky ones who encountered a problem with a cracked LCD. I bought my camera less than 3 weeks ago and was extremely happy with it. It is light-weight, beautifully designed and takes great pictures. Then the other day, my LCD mysteriously cracked! It was always in my purse and I have it safely tucked in a thick camera case so I dont know how that could have happened. I never dropped, banged or abused it in any way. There was not a single scratch on the exterior of the camera so I dont know how the LCd could have been damaged. (The Canon representative I talked to said it may have been exposed to extreme heat or cold which causes damage to the LCD. But I never kept it in any place over a normal room temperature.) I just turned it on and a white screen with purple jagged lines appeared on the LCD. And all this happened 2 days before I was suppose to leave for my vacation to Hong Kong, which was the main reason I bought the camera in the first place. Very disappointing!! Fortunately, the online store I bought it from is willing to exhange the camera for a brand new one. I decided to get the same model however because many of my friends have had the Canon cameras (the SD200, SD300 AND SD400) for years and they havent had any problems with it. I figured this one I got was a defective item and i'll have better luck on the next one.","This camera is incredibly small (it can fit inside an Altoids tin).  The pictures are just as good, and the flash is good enough for darker scenes.  The video mode is convenient, but not very feature filled.  I am not a serious photographer, but everything I want to capture, I can.  In some cases, there were two compacts, this one, and a Sony Cybershot, and the Canon had superior low light pictures.","I bought this camera looking for something compact, and something high quality though. That is exactly what I got. I love it because it is so small, it fits nice in the pocket, and if you buy a carry case it is still small enough to wear on your belt without discomfort. I really enjoy this product, it takes great pictures, and it was a great price too, i saw it in stores for $100 more at some places.","i previously had 2 cameras a Kodak CX6200 2 Megapixel camera and a sony DSC-P78 and found that with the sony any photo i took tht wasnt in perfect daylight was blurry and basically not worth keeping (as a result i have tarnished memories of an epic trip to the snow) so out the door went the sony. i purchased this canon after reading many reviews for many different camaeras and i have to say i absolutely love it.<br /><br />its so small it fits perfectly in my pocket and i carry it alomost every time i go out and as a result have some awesome memories of some great times.<br /><br />i thoroughly recommend this camera to anyone looking at purchasing it. its fantastic.<br /><br />as for the screen cracking fault that people seem to be having, hasnt happened too me (touchwood). i noticed most people got this problem a few months after purchase. something to think about<br /><br />anyway, happy hunting","given the diminutive dimensions of said big time.  Seriously, I'm not much of a gizmo guru, but the camera takes good pictures.  I'm just afraid I'll swallow it in my morning eggs.","I orderded the Canon SD300 camera on Saturday 10/8/2005.  I received my camera the afternoon of Tuesday 10/13/2005.  I was absolutely astonished at the speedy delivery of my merchandise.  I will definately order more items in the future from OneCall.  Thank you for the prompt delivery service.<br /><br />Scotty Ferguson","I'm a digital point-and-shoot camera kind of guy. I've previously owned two Sony Cybershots, a Fuji Finepix 6 mp, and a Canon S400. Going into this new purchase, I decided to look into Canon as it's always impressed me with nice looks (in the Elph line) and great colors. They've been doing it for so long, and although other brands have been competing with Canon in features and size, nobody can surpass Canon's beautiful palette of crystal-clear colors.<br /><br />I wanted a camera that is small, yet still has a big screen (been a hot commodity lately). Canon delivers with this model on both fronts, the size is beautifully and intelligently compacted, taking features from past Elph models and fusing them into the most attractive and sensible package.<br /><br />So:<br /><br />- Small camera<br /><br />- Large LCD screen<br /><br />- Canon-quality photography<br /><br />- Added 'manual mode' features<br /><br />- Fixed problems, like Canon's past model's long lags between flash shots<br /><br />- New everything: new battery type (larger, flatter), new memory card format (sd rather than CompactFlash = much smaller chip)<br /><br />Canon has really been brainstorming and working on always bettering their products, and it is beautifully shown in this camera. Kind of like how Apple has been constantly at work adding features to their iPod line, so too has Canon been always improving. And I applaud that.","It's all I always wanted. Good shots in night, small and light... and i think a good price.","I used to have a Canon S200 and this is superior in so many ways. Superquick from power on to being ready for picture, terrific pictures (colors are awesome), tiny camera (pocket size), fast scrolling through pics on camera, good red-eye reduction software, great video. In total, I am completely satisfied with this camera. I bought the 300 instead of the 400 as I read that the pictures with the 400 are not as good due to compressing more resolution on the same size CCD. Don't know if this is the case, but the 4 megapixels is plenty for just about everything.","I've had this for about half a year now, and I have to say that is really a perfect camera, pros:<br /><br />- very good image quality<br /><br />- takes unlimited length movie (well, limited by the size of the memory available)<br /><br />- LCD is not only large, but the display is much sharper than the Nikon and Casio cameras.<br /><br />- compact.<br /><br />- durable.  i dropped it once from 4 ft. high (slipped out of my hands) onto some stone steps while on vacation, but it functions no different from before.  The only things left to remind me of the incident are that the metal casing is a bit bent and that there's a tiny dent on one corner.<br /><br />Con:<br /><br />- the only thing i can think of is that in order to change the shooting mode to manual, you need to press buttons and change from menu, instead of turning the knob like in my old canon S45.","I've had some experience with digital cameras.  Have handled most if not all of the most popular brands, and I must say that I have found that Canon cameras seem to take the best pictures.  I've used 7 megapixel cameras from Sony and compared it with similar shots from a 3.2mp Canon, and the picture quality is far superior.  The flash is also wonderful, I've taken pictures in pitch black and they come out clear.  The SD300 is a wonderful unit in the Canon line, I've had it for some time now and I can't find anything to complain about other than because of its size it may be easily misplaced.  It usually amazes people to see the pictures produced by this pint sized camera, and the camera is extremely sleek and beautiful.  It uses SD cards which for me is great as it is compatible with my laptop and other devices.  The battery life is also great, even better when you take pictures in the daylight and conserve on flash.  The video quality and supported special effects is pretty good too.  I would highly recommend the SD300 for anyone seeking a camera that you can easily fit in your pocket, has great battery life, takes beautiful pictures and video.","I am very impressed with this camera.  The only thing is that once you get it, you'll need to go out and buy a larger memory card.  The one that comes with the camera is only 16MB, therefore you can't really use the video feature without using it all up after 5 seconds.  Other than that, it's a great buy.  I shopped around forever for the best deal on this particular model.  The best deal I found was on Amazon with tax included and free shipping.  It was definitely worth it to shop around and I am completely satisfied.","Super easy to use camera. Fits in a pocket, yet gives excellent quality pictures. Couldn't be happier about my purchase.","I bought this camera to take on vacation and it arrived the day we left. It was easy to learn to use and takes great pictures. I was surprize that  the video feature took such clear audio and video. I took pictures from a moving car and action shots of the surf which came out very clear. I'm still finding all the features of this great, small, light weight camera.","great camera - takes quick photos and good video and i can put it in my front jeans pocket.","This camera is awesome & well worth the fortune I paid for it. Since I have not used all the features yet, and I have not found anything about the camera that I don't like I'll list the features I have used.<br /><br />1. SIZE - this camera is the perfect size for both front jeans pockets and back pockets.  The small size could be a drawback for those with large hands or arthritis, but as I have standard size female hands the small size does not affect my use of the camera (my brother also owns this camera and does not have any problems with size).<br /><br />2. QUALITY OF PICTURES - the overall quality of my pictures has been really good.  The camera has a flashing orange light which flashes after the shutter is pressed and before it closes if the camera was not held relatively steady while the shutter was pressed. While using the action mode, all my pictures have been clear.  I have not experienced any of the weird purple shadows that other reviews mention.<br /><br />3. USE - this camera is very easy to use.  Basically point and shoot. Changing between modes is easy once you figure it out (reading the manual is a good idea).<br /><br />4. DOWNLOADING - once pictures are on the camera, it is very easy to download them to the computer (install the software first)  just plug-in and follow the steps.<br /><br />5. BATTERY - I have not used this camera for extended periods of time, but for just plain old regular use the battery works great.<br /><br />I really love my SD300.  I researched cameras for weeks before deciding on it, and it was the obvious choice (except for the price, but it is well worth it).  I highly recommend this camera to anyone wanting a good point-and-shoot digital camera that is easily portable and simple to use.","After reading the negative reviews and warnings here (and via Google searches), I went ahead and bought this camera.  As near as I can tell, it offers the best quality pictures and features for the money.  Of course, this will be irrelevant if I encounter the manufacturing defects that are so often described.  As for now, I'm extremely satisfied with this camera!","I have had other small digital cameras. This one is the greatest! It is fast, takes great pictures and is small enough to carry with you at all times.","Canon are good quality cameras. i had the previous snapshot and i love it. My only complaint was that it is thick in width. Now i bought this one for my sister and it is even better. She loves the camera. Very easy to set up, play with and learn the many options that it provides. I recommend it to any person looking to buy a digital camera for a semi-decent price.","Love the camera, much faster all around than my old Fugi 2400Z.<br /><br />What you may have read is true about purple fringing, only noticable in bright high contrast situations. The only other downfall is no on demand battery meter, it only lets you know a little before it goes dead. The camera takes great pictures, easy on the eyes menu system and plenty fast w/o superfast memory. If you want better than this in the Canon line skip the SD400(it dosen't take better pictures) and go right to the SD500.","First, I am not a professional photographer.  I *am*, however, an enthusiatic amateur, who has taken pictures for 25 years, with a variety of cameras, including SLRs.  I am the proud owner of a Canon S230, Canon G1 and Canon G2.  We got the Canon S230 because it was very small and took VGA quality movies (ie, 640 x 320 movies), which look good on a TV screen.  We lost the S230 and needed a replacment, therefore we got the SD300.  What a difference!!!  This camera, the SD300, surpasses them All!  I have used this camera extensively for a month now.  Like the commericals for the old TV show, the 'Six Milliion Dollar Man', this camera does it 'faster, better, longer'!  I chose this over the SD400 as my favorite camera website, [...], thought the SD400 had 'soft' images.  I also looked at the SD500, but thought that the smaller size of SD300 camera was better for me (and cheaper to boot!)<br /><br />What I liked:<br />0.  Great, well exposed pictures that make great prints.<br />1.  Excellent macro -- 3cm!  This is better than the SD400 or SD500<br />2.  DIGIC II processor really works well to quickly and  accurately get well focused images....way better than the previous DIGIC 1 processor.<br />3.  Movie mode is excellent.  The length of the movie (with sound) is only limited by the SD care size<br /><br />What I did not like:<br />1.  Poor flash.  Now, this is not a dig against the SD300 only, rather a comment on the fact that ultracompacts do not function very well for indoor flash photography...although an external flash the HFDC1, is available.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This camera is well worth the cost.  I got mine from Amazon for 300 bucks and it has performed flawlessly.  I would say that it is a good idea to READ THE MANUAL as it will dramatically improve one's pictures.  I would also get a high speed SD card so that movies can be easily recorded.<br />For what it's worth, I know that others have had problems with the screen cracking.  I have taken this camera on hikes, etc. without any case, just in my pocket, with no problems.<br />Buy this camera, you won't regret it.","I've taken it out with me just about everywhere.  It works great.  The pictures are good.  The only problems I've had are with red eye inside and some blurriness on a few occasions.  I think I was shaking a little on those.  The red eye just might be because I didn't have the red eye reduction turned on.  I've also had some weird blue eye effects from time to time.  I would recommend purchasing an extra battery.  I bought a generic brand on a popular auction website for ~$10 shipped.  Using the video feature eats up the battery and so does a lot of LCD use.  But I've taken 100 pictures in a night with average LCD use and a few video clips before the battery gave a low indication.  It's rediculously small and light weight.  Anybody who has complained about the pictuers not being good enough or the zoom not being good enough is being too picky.  It's not designed to be a professional photographer's camera.  If you just want to take snaps for fun or for posterity then this is an excellent camera because it takes good pictures and you can take it anywhere.","The last camera I ever wanted was a digital....too difficult, too expensive....and then, who wants to be one of those tourists holding their cameras high above their heads and snapping away with wild abandon?<br /><br />  When I retired, my school gave me a check with which I wanted to purchase something memorable....so I caved for the camera.  After a little research, I chose the Canon Elph and cleared it with my hi-tech son. The Amazon price (around 300.00) was very competitive.<br /><br />  Why I waited so long to plunge into digital land I now wonder.  This is fun...and user friendly...and so easy to carry around.  It is also pretty amazing since one can make a short movie; but the best part is the ability to download pictures to the laptop and flood relatives and friends with photos of vacations, babies and cats.","Great camera for the price, compact size is a huge plus, battery life is above average, and with a larger memory card (512mg) I rarely need to think of charging the camera or emptying the stick.  The video quality is surprisingly good, and the photos are everything I would expect and more from a pocket digital camera. Overall, I am thrilled with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a point and shoot digital camera.","Great battery life, huge screen with great resolution, easy to use but plentiful shooting modes, small size can be carried in almost any pocket -- even a shirt pocket.  Only problem is screen is easily scratched.","This camera is great! It takes exceptional pictures and is very easy to maneuver.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who needs a digital camera. :-)","This camera is good but there are a few problems. If your a big clutz like me then small camera is prolly not a good idea. There is also an orb problem with this camera. It is not just mine, I know people with this camera and orbs frequently show up in dark pictures and sometimes in other pictures. This was cool for about a day. Other than that I like it, I mean I didn't return it and that says something.","The first SD300 that was shipped to me was defective.  I was concerned that maybe the camera was a bad product overall, but I know many others that own Canon Powershots who love them.  I decided to give the camera another shot.  I exchanged the defective one for a new SD300 and I LOVE the camera.  The flash does not have a long range, so indoor shots are very dark, but I love the LCD screen and for the purpose that I use the camera, it is perfect for what I need.  It is tiny, and that was an important feature for me.  It is sleek looking and the zoom is decent.  For basic memorabilia, this camera is perfect.  For anyone looking for a nice camera that can fit in your purse and keep track of all the important events in your life, I highly recommend this one!  For anyone looking to start their career in photography, there are far better cameras out there to suit your needs.","I purchased this camera to replace a Pentax Optio 330 which got wet and died.<br /><br />This is a nice little camera, much smaller than the small Pentax that it replaced. It takes very nice pictures. The LCD screen is nice and bright, but beware - it scratches easily. The pictures don't seem as vivid as they did with the Pentax, but they could be considered more realistic with the Canon. The time difference between pushing the shutter button and the picture being taken is much shorter on the Canon.<br /><br />My only beef that I have is that the 'auto' mode doesn't let me change two settings that I like to tweak.<br /><br />The first one is the auto-focus selection. The camera focuses on what it 'thinks' you want to focus on (of multiple focus points). It does provide an indication of what it selected. But, you have no way of overriding that in auto mode. You must switch to one of the other modes for that override capability.<br /><br />The other is the ability to force the flash to turn on, which I use often outdoors for fill-flash. You cannot force the flash on in 'auto' mode. Yet again, you must get out of auto mode to change this setting. You can force the flash to stay off in auto mode, but not force it to go on.<br /><br />This is a nice camera to take along when you don't want to carry your larger SLR. Just be careful not to scratch that LCD screen.","This was my first foray into a digital camera that came with much dismay about whether to finally take the plunge.  Having been a long time Canon 35mm owner, I looked at this and many other options.<br /><br />This camera has been a great find.  It has a large screen, easy to use controls for point and shoot fun.  I used this camera on a recent week long trip to China after having owned it for only one week.  I hauled along the 35mm just in case... needless to say that roll of film is still in the camera weeks later.  The joy of taking a picture and checking the quality are worth the jump to digital.  Colors and clarity were excellent with this camera.  Shooting in the mid-quality mode let me get 300 pictures and some short video clips onto the 512 MB card with room to spare.  Another added bonus was the size and ease of portability.  Movie mode is great, but will eat up your memory card.  Go for the 1G card if you want to take a lot of footage.  Size and weight were a major concern for me and this does not disappoint.  It will fit in the palm of your hand, yet is light and offers the benefits a large screen.<br /><br />A couple of small downsides include getting used to the focus with this camera, particularly for long distance shots and figuring out which mode will accomplish this task best.  Sometimes having too many modes is almost a hassle.  It also would be great if this camera had a slightly better way to review the most recent picture, but eventually you'll get it.  The other twist is the lack of a battery monitor.  Keep an extra battery on hand because once the indicator comes up you have about five pics left.<br /><br />I also picked up the accessory pack with an extra battery.  I managed to use the two batteries to take mearly 300 pictures and didn't have to charge over a 9 day vacation.  The camera is tough to get out of the holder when on a belt unless there's a strap on the camera.<br /><br />Quality of prints seems to be excellet.  Included software is ok.<br /><br />Have not experienced any of the cracked screens or error messages other users have reported, but did experience a bit of the condensation problem when going from cold to warm climates.  Don't lose your battery charger... made this mistake and a replcement (Canon proprietary) cost $60.<br /><br />This camera and its prints have made heads turn, particularly from other people who were on the same trip.","This is my fourth digital camera in the last twelve months. I am constantly buying new ones in the $300-500 price range and selling them on eBay once they've revealed their flaws to me. Without a doubt, this is the best one I've had and I think it'll stick around for a while. What's good about it:<br /><br />1. size and style are great; there is nothing that can be improved upon here;<br /><br />2. the LCD is a nice size without sacrificing the viewfinder;<br /><br />3. the controls are very easy to access and understand. Though I prefer the point-and-shoot method, I find myself dabbling with the controls a lot and I take better pictures because of it;<br /><br />4. the time it takes between opening the camera and taking a photo is almost instantaneous. There's no warmup period. Likewise, taking several pictures rapidly is a breeze, no lag time at all;<br /><br />5. in general, the camera is simple to use. Someone with no experience could pick this up and use immediately; and<br /><br />6. I wish more cameras would use plain ole AA batteries, but since that's probably never going to happen, Canon's li-on battery is adequate. It lasts a decent amount of time and charges very quickly. The charger is improved in this line from the S410, which was somewhat bigger and more awkward.<br /><br />And what I don't like:<br /><br />1. pictures indoors or after dusk just don't turn out that well, regardless of using the nighttime/indoor settings on the camera. I think that the flash is adequate but after all my digital camera trading, have found this to be a universal weakness. It's annoying;<br /><br />2. no meter for the battery. You get about five pictures once the indicator tells you the battery is on the way out. It's something a lot of people have complained about and doesn't seem like a tough thing for Canon to fix; and<br /><br />3. the software that comes with the camera is junk. I hate it. I recommend downloading Picasa, which is fabulous, and free.<br /><br />As for the LCD cracking, that really sucks and I hope it doesn't happen to me. The obvious answer is to pick up a case and cart it around in that. I haven't had any experience with redeye-no more than expected, anyway-or purple fringing. For the price and portability factors, the SD300 can't be beat.","I am giving this five stars because I cant give 4.5. I had the camera for about a month and the screen became bluishly hued. I guess the Lcd might have cracked. I sent it to Canon and got it repaired for free. For a very compact camera,, it takes really good pictures. The manual mode with a good adjustment is adequate. The pictures are a little on the soft side. Night pictures are decent, but the camera really shines on cloudy days. The flash is okay for the most part. 4MP suprisingly takes really good pictures, I was skeptic gettig this camera because of the resolution, but it does look amazing. I love the macro mode a lot. The camera itself is sexy, on par with my ipod. It's light in the pocket but feels substantial when held. You wont appreciate the size until you hold it. It fits you pockets easily. If you want the best in ultracompact/best picture quality, you cant go wrong with the Canon SD series","I recently purchased the SD300 and have not been overly pleased with it. I am a confessed shutter bug so my quality standards are somewhat higher than most. Here are the things I like about the camera:<br /><br />1) Nice look and feel - metal outside and nice weight<br /><br />2) Compact size - one of the smallest with zoom and the feature set<br /><br />3) Separate battery charger is very small and easy to take with you.<br /><br />4) Uses standard USB cable to transfer directly from camera to computer<br /><br />Things I don't like:<br /><br />1) Pictures are definitely on the soft side<br /><br />2) Very hard to get a decent picture in moderately low light without the flash. I suppose it is using a very slow shuttle speed.<br /><br />3) I would like a battery meter instead of indication your battery is almost dead<br /><br />and last but not least and the reason I returned it<br /><br />4) the LCD is basically unprotected and since it is very large, I felt I would break it like many other reviewer's have. I frankly do not believe the LCD breaks by itself, but since there is no protection on it, simply grabbing it a little hard seems like it could damage the display.<br /><br />I want to thank all the previous reviewers that made me aware of this issue. There are many other cameras that have unprotected LCD's too, not just Cannon's. However, there are also many that protect them with a plastic or glass cover.<br /><br />I'm trading the SD300 in for the Casio Z55 which is the same size, lighter in weight, 5 Megapixels and equivalent functionality. The jury is still out the picture quality of the Z55.","I am pleasantly surprised by how small it is. It is about the size of a deck of cards. But the best of all is that it does everything I want and more.<br /><br />Great<br /><br />- Very Sharp and rich pictures as well as video<br /><br />- Great real time video in a small package - I don't bring my camcorder anymore!<br /><br />- Fast focusing - no delay<br /><br />- Fast processing and saving to memory<br /><br />Not so great<br /><br />- Metal body is slippery - use wrist strap at all times<br /><br />- Software menu to adjust manual setting<br /><br />- Battery life is short (about 100 shots) especailly when using flash and shooting video<br /><br />This camera is for my wife and she loves it. I can't wait for a prosumer version for myself!","i upgraded my sd110 to this camera...im happy with my choice..<br /><br />i chose this camera for its better optical zoom and more MPs..and when i received it i was happy to see that it was a thinner and smaller camera than the sd110..which i thought to be small enough<br /><br />the sd300 also offers a 2\" viewing screen which makes it very cool.<br /><br />its a well built and designed camera in my opinion...it was a bit pricey...but all in all..worth it i guess...it was more of a buy than splurging on the sd400 in my opinion...which didnt offer enough to make me spend that extra money..","Let me begin by saying that Canon makes exceptional digital cameras; the best in the market right now. This is because they have always used high quality components since they began manufacturing digital cameras. This one is no exception.<br /><br />Now that I've sold you on a Canon, which one should you choose?<br /><br />First off, let's see if you really need an SDxxx camera, or would be better suited with a cheaper non ultraportable camera.<br /><br />The SDxxx Series offers several key advantages over less portable models:<br /><br />-Beautiful, sleek design and metallic body will wow anyone who sees it.<br /><br />-Gorgeous 2 inch LCD screens<br /><br />-The excellent Dig!c 2 processor (other Canons only have dig!c 1)<br /><br />-Much better movie mode than previous Canons<br /><br />-Small light, easy pocketability<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some significant drawbacks due to the components Canon had to use to get the camera so small:<br /><br />-Few manual controls.<br /><br />-Pictures are not as sharp as those of similar non ultraportable cameras.<br /><br />-The flash is very close to the lens (lots of redeye problems)<br /><br />-More purple fringing issues than other Canons<br /><br />-Proprietary batteries that are expensive to replace<br /><br />-The LCD is very fragile. Read the SD200 and SD300 reviews to see lots of unhappy people whose LCDs broke. Canon's warranty does NOT cover this either. My suggestion? Buy using a credit card that offers a warranty in addition to the manufacturer's. If your lcd breaks, many CC companies will replace the camera no questions asked!<br /><br />If you don't need the ultra portability and flashy looks of the SD cameras, a slightly larger camera with more features might be right for you. I would highly suggest Canon's A510 or A520 if you don't need an SD model.<br /><br />If you still want an SD model, which one should you choose? The SD200 with 3.2mp, the SD300 with 4mp, the SD400 with 5mp, or the SD500 at a whopping 7.1mp?<br /><br />Your first instinct may be that more megapixels is better. Today, however megapixel ratings are similar to Ghz ratings in the computer world: They used to mean a lot, but they don't mean as much anymore. More megapixels do NOT mean a better image. They mean a larger printable image. Unless you have to have huge prints, you simply do not more megapixels. In fact, the 3.2mp of the SD200 is enough for anyone who doesn't plan on printing pictures larger than a standard 8.5x11 sheet of paper.<br /><br />That having been said, there are some differences between each SDxxx model. In order to get the larger 7.1mp sensor in the SD500, Canon had to make the camera larger. Thus, it is around a quarter inch thicker and 30% heavier than the other 3 models. The larger size did enable Canon to pack more features into it, however:<br /><br />Features unique to the SD500:<br /><br />-1/4 inch thicker<br /><br />-30% heavier<br /><br />-50% longer flash range<br /><br />-14% more battery life<br /><br />The SD400 and SD500 also share these benefits over the SD200/SD300:<br /><br />-New \"Night Display\" feature which brightens the LCD in low light<br /><br />-My Colors feature lets you highlight or swap colors right on the camera<br /><br />-USB 2.0 High Speed support<br /><br />The following are shared by all the SDxxx Cameras:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Beautiful, eye catching design<br /><br />-Great image quality, though not as good as non ultraportable models<br /><br />-New Dig!c 2 image processor<br /><br />-Excellent Movie Mode<br /><br />-3x optical zoom is adequate for most people<br /><br />-Excellent, intuitive manual controls<br /><br />-Huge 2.0 inch lcd that looks great under various lighting conditions<br /><br />-Uses widely available and cheap SD cards<br /><br />Cons (most of these are minor quirks):<br /><br />-Some purple fringing problems<br /><br />-Proprietary batteries are expensive to replace and inconvenient at times<br /><br />-Lots of issues with fragile LCDs<br /><br />-No RAW support<br /><br />-Few manual controls<br /><br />If you do choose this product, the first thing you should buy is a larger SD memory card. The camera comes with a 16mb card (32 in the SD500), which is pretty much useless.<br /><br />You should also immediately purchase a case and some screen protectors to protect the LCD.","I love this camera. The big LCD screen is great to work with. As long as you have a reasonably fast SD card you can record video up to the full length of the card (although as with all still cameras recording video, the image is a bit jumpy & shaky, and you can't change focus while recording). It writes pictures extremely quickly -- little or no delay (especially compared to my previous, 5-year-old digital camera). And it's absolutely tiny!<br /><br />Be warned, though. The flash is very weak. And it's easy to get your finger in the way of the flash. This means a fairly high percentage of my indoor shots are a little disappointing. My SD300 also seems to have more trouble with contrast than my old Kodak DC280. It seems to get that \"washed out\" white more often.<br /><br />You'll be making some tradeoffs with the SD300, but I love it and strongly recommend it.","This camera is great for packing in your bag/pocket and always having it when you need it.  I was always kicking myself for missing great shots when we were out somewhere, and I was getting annoyed at carrying our bulky Olympus whenever we were on vacation.  This camera is the perfect size to tuck in the diaper bag or in my pocket, and I've been able to get some great shots because of that.  The camera is easy to operate-- my friend's mom was impressed because she is intimidated by digital cameras, but had no problem with this one.<br /><br />Like several of the reviewers have said, this isn't SLR quality.  It's on par with digital cameras in this range, and I have gotten great pictures for our website and when printed in 4x6\" size got great quality.  We printed a few pictures in 8x10\" and did have some graininess.  The camera is great for what I bought it for-- getting good, spontaneous photos.<br /><br />If you buy this camera, I would recommend buying a bigger memory card-- the one that comes with it is too small.  Also, buy an extra battery-- otherwise, you will have to wait several hours while yours charges.  I always have a spare charged battery in my bag, and that way I won't have to miss any shots.","I wanted a small camera, and boy, is this small.  I am no camera geek so I am happy with the functionality of this thing.  I read the negative reviews on this site and was a bit skeptical but went ahead with it anyway because it has everything I wanted.  Let me share my experience with the things people have complained about:<br /><br />1) Pictures are clear, not blurry<br /><br />2) No fringing or purple outlines on the picture<br /><br />3) No soft edges<br /><br />4) LCD is fine.  I dont see how it will break by itself.  I think people tend to sit down while this is in their back pocket<br /><br />5) Battery life is decent.  Love the fact that I do not need to buy batteries for this<br /><br />6) size is great if you want to use this all the time","I really love my Canon sd300, I love the big lcd, the fast response and the great photos it produce, I always carry it with me in my bag, never a day it's not in my bag, except if my kids wants to borrow it. This is my 5th digital cam and this is my favorite because of its small size.<br /><br />I really recommend this, in fact my friend got one because of me and she brings it with her all the time.  We usually get confused which one is hers and which one is mine :)  So far I've been using it since November 2004 and no cracked lcd whatsoever.","This is my first digital camera and I love it so far!  I have only taken pictures and downloaded them onto my computer, but they look good.  The zoomed pictures have been fuzzy, but I think it's because I didn't use the digital zoom.  The camera was also really easy to figure out by reading the manual.  I've heard Sony's are more complicated.  The only downside is that the battery runs low fast. Don't leave it in the camera when not in use.  OVerall, it's awesome and small :-)","After doing endless research I settled on this great purchase. I had read numerous reviews discussing picture quality, easy of use and sleek compact styling. I am happy to report that I have found everything to be true! So far it's perfect!","Purchased this camera two weeks ago and am delighted.  Great quality pictures and video.  It is true that you really do need to read the instructions, but even playing with the knobs and dials on this little wonder is educational and it is not difficult to figure out most things.  In addition, the camera comes with a zillion cheat sheets and instruction books in multiple languages.  I bought a Sandisk Extreme III SD card so as not to have to worry about memory capacity, and the accessory pack including the leather case.  I keep it on my belt and I have been taking pictures of the kids, etc. easily where I would never have done so before.  And the movie mode--just fantastic. Wish the viewfinder were off center a little but it is not that big a deal.  Other than that, if you are a professional photographer this might not be your ideal camera, but I have already used it much more than I was using my old Kodak DC290 and I would buy it again in a minute.","I am very happy with this camera due to it's small size and several different shooting modes. However I noticed that in low light conditions if you do not use the flash the pictures are somewhat blurry, even if you change the settings around. It appears that the camera needs the flash to focus properly. Red-eye is a major problem with this camera even with the red-eye reduction shooting mode. So be prepared to fix a lot of red-eyes out of your pictures.<br /><br />Also my LCD cracked for no apparent reason. I took the camera out of it's case to take a picture and the LCD was white with a purple blob in the center. I was unable to view anything on the LCD or even change the settings. I mailed the camera back to Canon for repairs, which takes about 3 weeks and as you can imagine it is not covered under warranty. The cost for the repair is close to $200. I did some research on the internet and found that this is a common problem. I really like the SD300 but am rather unhappy with the LCD repair costs and problems.","I have owned and tried out 5 digicams within 5 years ranging from :<br /><br />1. Nikon Coolpix 800 - First camera, good pix but simply too big, sold on ebay<br /><br />2. Canon S200 - Small, 2megpixels only but good backup camera<br /><br />3. Canon S45 - not small at all but good features, sold on ebay<br /><br />4. Nikon Coolpix 5400 - returned within 1days from Costco because of too complex manual and old technology (introduced 2 years ago)<br /><br />5. Canon SD300 - Smallish and good image and excellent video<br /><br />Whoever want to be professional, please go get digital SLR.  Any so called prosumer digital camera ($400+) is not going to solve your problem.  Please ask yourself if you are taking pictures in auto or semi-auto mode 90% of the time or not.  If so, any so called features is a joke.<br /><br />This one offers simply but enough features to satisfy you needs.  Good picture and excellent video.  However, please do not abuse the use of video mode unless you have multi-GB SD card.  The video is good but the file size is way tooooooo big.","OK...<br /><br />I was a little nervous based on some of the reviews here - so here goes ( I Have had this for a couple days now)<br /><br />Size:<br /><br />Absolutely tiny - unbelievable how small these things have gotten.  I am convinced that the role of SLRs and regular film cameras are dead.  I did not use my SLR because it was big and bulky - this thing will sit in your pocket and not even be noticed.  Still functional easy to press buttons and use the camera.  Very happy.<br /><br />Camera Usability:<br /><br />I came from a previous Canon S45 - so I was familar the interface which really hasnt changed much in the last three years.  It has a 2 inch lcd which is very bright and nice to look at.  If you know canon - no need to read the book.  If you are new to canon - it is pretty intuitive - so again Very Happy.<br /><br />Camera Picture Quality:<br /><br />It is a 4MP camera and appears to take pictures every bit as good as my old canon s45.  Zoom is 3x and it comes with all the standard manual settings - including an underwater setting - which is pretty exciting - since I will be taking my camera to Hawaii in a couple of days and am interested to see how that works (apparently takes some of the blue out of the water to show the real colors of the aquatic life) - and yes I ordered the optional waterproof case. (Pretty expensive - but makes this very functional for beach, pool, snorkling and raining - NOT for scuba.) - Very happy<br /><br />Camera Speed:<br /><br />Shutter is pretty darn quick - easily as fast as my old Canon EOS Elan II - especially with the flash off - wow - very fast - and I am using standard Sandisk memory (Not the ULTRA stuff - which may even make it faster) - Unbelievably happy<br /><br />Video Quality<br /><br />OK - This is what sold me on this guy - you can now take 640 x 480 resolution video on this little guy - pretty hard to believe. AND you can take unlimited up to the size of the memory card (so for a 1GB card that is about 9 minutes at the highest resolution).  This was one of my biggest wants on the s45 - you were limited to about 3 minutes and half the quality.  I have personally maxed out a 1GB standard Sandisk card with no problems  - pretty cool!  Unlike another reviewer I was able to not only play the video on my computer - I could do it from my hard drive or the card sitting in my card reader.  Video looked pretty good for something this small.  The other cool option was a 60 frame / second video option.  If you wanted to record sporting events (swing of the bat) this is pretty cool - you get 60 individual frames for each second of action - you capture everything. - Happy - and very cool.<br /><br />Battery / Charging<br /><br />Not much to say here - have yet to put the camera through its paces - but the battery seems to do pretty well - and the charger is tiny to match the camera - nice for traveling.<br /><br />Overall - very cool - very fun and excited to have it!  My wife loves it - and she hates technology - she called it cute - and something she could shove in her purse - so it was a winner for her as well.  Only downsides might be their is no compression for video - so it burns through memory extremely quick -<br /><br />I will be back in a week after a hard week of taking pictures of water and waves and can update how she did when I get back!!<br /><br />*************UPDATE*****************<br />OK - little slow to write my update - but have to say this thing is a champ.<br /><br />I took two SD cards on my trip - 1 1GB and 1 512MB.  I filled them both with pictures and video.  The battery was great - every time I used the camera - the battery lasted all day no problems.  Quality of the pictures was as expected.  Underwater case - worked great.  Underwater pictures were outstanding using the \"underwater\" mode on the camera (Takes out some of the blue).<br /><br />The video was great - I used all three modes (high quality, regular quality and internet quality).  We ended up using this more than our camcorder - (because it is so convenient).<br /><br />Have to say - after a month now - love this thing - and use it all the time because of the size!","Moving up from my Minolta Dimage x20, I wanted a smaller camera with greater megapixels and better video.  The SD 300 gives you that and more.  My challenge is what I took for granted.  You can not zoom while taking video with the Canon as you can with the x20.  The was a big downer.  Also you can only date stamp a photo in the postcard mode (1600 x1200). Again I could date stamp all photos at any quality level with the X20.  Since I store and view all of my pictures on computer, visible dates are important.<br /><br />The SD300 is good little camera.  Just know what you like and make sure you get it when looking to upgrade.","No matter how good a camera is, it won't take a good picture if it is sitting in a desk somewhere, which is where my high end SLR sat occasion after occasion due to its size. The SD300 takes incredibly good pictures for its size.  If you are going to the Grand Canyon or an indoor wedding where you need a powerful flash, take your SLR.  Take the SD300 with you for nearly everthing else.","I have had the camera 3 days...taking great pics and video at least what I can fit on the ridiculously small 16mb SD card that it comes with. I am no professional photographer but to me it's great. Tiny not much bigger than a deck of cards, well placed controls, easy to use. Lots of options/functionality! Big LCD very sharp disply. Works great in the auto mode! As for the review of the burry pics, purple fringing, red eye...it is non exsistant for me.","I bought this camera and Iam very happy<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Excellent Pictures and Video Same miniDV quality<br /><br />very small and stylish<br /><br />Great Flash better than s500 & sony p150<br /><br />sharp 2\" lcd screen<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The little purple and little soft edges<br /><br />I highly recommended this camera for advanced and novice users","I simply don't think you can find a better camera when you compare the size, construction quality, capability and price. It is so small, I have difficulty holding it. I guess that's why Panasonic came out with a ultra-compact camera with image stabilization. The image quality is good but definitely not great. The lens is only so big so the image can only be so good. The best part is that you can buy a weather-proof case from Canon designed specifically for the SD300 and SD200. Even with the case, the camera is still smaller than my Leica Digilux. Both camera and water proof case were made in Japan. I noticed that a number of Pentax Optios are now made in China. Nothing wrong with that but I think the Japanese made product still maintains a slight edge over its Chinese made equivalent. All in all, if you are looking for a super small camera to throw in a purse or pocket, I would highly recommend the SD300.","The reason I obtained this camera was as replacement to the S410.<br /><br />At first glance I was ecstatic because of the size, but playing with it, I soon came to realize I mised the easy functionality of the S410.  The abilty to change different modes from a click of the button.<br /><br />A mode that I had to hae with the new camera was photo stich.  I thought that the SD300 didn't provide this, but after toying a bit I found it, and now I must say I am completely in love with the camera! It's wonderful for these reasons.<br /><br />1) The quickness of ho everything works.  I.e. - menus, shooting, uploading.<br /><br />2) The easy menu access.  I like it that there are no buttons to push other than the func. and/or menu.  (A problem that I had with the S410 was if I put it in my pocket, a different mode came out each time)...so to continue<br /><br />3) Size/portability.  The camera is just about the size of my cell phone.  I can carry it in my pocket anywhere I go.<br /><br />4)  The quality of the photos.  Pristine.<br /><br />This is truely a wonderful portable camera for anyone who is a point and shoot fanatic!<br /><br />The macro mode is a great new addition to give those wonderful close up shots.<br /><br />If you love to shoot, you will love the SD300.","This camera is everything I was looking for in a camera.  It is SMALL, easy to use (I never even had to read the user's manual to figure the bad boy out), the pictures and video are beautiful!<br /><br />The screen is a great size too.  Everyone I know is jealous.","Great size, great features, fantastic movie mode.  The image quality is okay - not great, and the red eye function doesn't work.  If the red eye function worked, then I would rate it a 5 star.","I actually waited for Canon SD300 to come out for about 3 months. I got it as soon as it was out. The feature set is great. I like taking pictures in the manual mode. That way I have control over ISO settings, exposure, white balance etc.<br /><br />The picture quality is fine. Not over the edge but decent. The biggest complaint I have with this camera is the red eye problem. The problem persists even when you turn on the red eye reduction. If your subject is looking right into the camera, you will get those devil eyes almost every time. I've had other digital cameras where I never had to turn on red eye. And with this camera even when red eye reduction is on. The results are terrible. I am truely disappointed at this. Canon!! You're better than this...you could've done a better job!!","I've owned several digital cameras in the past, including Olympus, Canon, and Pentax. I took a chance on buying the Pentax this year, becuase I didn't know much about the quality of the photos of this brand. The Pentax S4i is fantastic for it's size, weight, and large LCD screen. BUT, for picture quality Pentax S4i is only good when you take pictures outside or have a lot of light in the room. If there is even the slightest lack of light, the grain is easily apparent. It's like looking at a picture with sand on it.<br /><br />With Canon, it doesn't grain as easily as Pentax. When it does have grain, it's smoother - less noticable (not sandy like Pentax).  The picture quality is better than before. The flash is noticably more powerful. And no more long lag times in snapping a photo, which was a problem from previous Elphs. Previous Elphs every now and then took it's sweet time trying to focus in-and-out before it feels ready to take the picture.<br /><br />The size is slightly smaller than the Pentax S4i, which is amazing to me. It's not as light as Pentax, but I don't mind it a bit (whatever makes the photo better). Lastly another significant change is that Canon finally uses the SD Memory Card instead of the Compact Flash (which processes faster than the usual Compact Flash).<br /><br />Overall, it is the best point-and-shoot digital camera I found that's out there.  If you want to protect this camera, buy a very padded case (you'll be glad you did). When I had the Pentax at first, I was lucky to find this light blue/gray Samsonite case that I found at Target that fits the camera perfectly and is very padded (without being huge). I don't know if they sell it anymore, but I've accidently dropped my Pentax down the stairs before and it was perfectly fine.","SD300 is the latest Elph from Canon. It is slimmer and loaded with more features than ever before.<br /><br />Pro's,<br /><br />1. Good picture quality for a super-compact camera.<br /><br />2. Priced right.<br /><br />3. Excellent feature set.<br /><br />4. Large LCD screen.<br /><br />5. Cool metallic body.<br /><br />6. Excellent package including a smart world charger.<br /><br />7. Uses industry standard SD cards, not propreitary memory sticks or xD.<br /><br />8. 3x is the right zoom for most people.<br /><br />9. Intuitive interface and solid build quality.<br /><br />Con's,<br /><br />1. No manual controls yet on Elph.<br /><br />2. Awkward to hold compared to older Elph's (No place put your right thumb when taking pics).<br /><br />3. Battery life is below average.<br /><br />4. Another costly & propreitary battery from Canon.<br /><br />5. 4MP is a waste of money for most people, 3MP is the right number.<br /><br />Its hard to get very exicted about the latest Elph if you already own one, there isn't much new. However if you are looking for your first, the SD200/SD300 are an excellent choice.","I had this camera for a few weeks now. Absolutely love it. The sleekest thing about this camera is the size. I can put it in my pocket and bring it anywhere I want. It's a great point-and-shoot camera. Quality of pictures are as good as my S30. The high resolution movie is also amazing. If you are planning to get this camera, I would recommend 2 accessories:<br />1. Canon Digital Elph Accessories kit for SD300 and SD200. This kit includes a spare battery, a sturdy case (just fits the camera, has a belt clip and handstrap, plus a steel neck strap).<br />2. Sandisk 1GB SD card. Even though this is not the Ultra II highspeed card, I can still use it to shoot videos with the camera.","This camera is simply amazing. I suggest you buy this over any other camera on the ultracompact market.<br /><br />I really did my research to find this camera. I looked in about every place on the net that sells cameras, and I chose this one.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />-ULTRACOMPACT<br /><br />-Huge LCD<br /><br />-Spectacular \"set-up\" photos, like portraits and closeups.<br /><br />-Great spontaneous photos, like quickies<br /><br />-Read/Write time (with the included sd) is AMAZING<br /><br />-Startup time is under 1 second (excellent)<br /><br />-Canon's photo manual is very helpful and nice<br /><br />-Included software is pretty darn good. (I'm sure you could find better, but I use it because of it's simplicity.)<br /><br />-Manual settings is very good for an ultracompact<br /><br />-Battery life is good, and it charges in 90 minutes<br /><br />-Switching from Photo to Review (and vice versa) is VERY fast<br /><br />-Excellent video mode for a camera of this caliber<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-No battery life meter (that I can tell)<br /><br />-Sort of flimsy av-out flap<br /><br />The Pro's heavily outweigh the cons, no doubt.<br /><br />Overall, I would seriously recommend this camera to anyone who wants:<br /><br />1. A small, lightweight camera they can take everywhere<br /><br />2. Nice, big prints from an ultracompact<br /><br />3. Enough funtions to get the job done.<br /><br />Buy this.","My priorities when shopping for a camera were:<br />Small size, large screen, movie mode with sound, at least 3X optical zoom, good image quality.<br /><br />The SD 300 delivered on all counts.  It is really small- I know that Casio makes a thinner camera, but I have found the SD300 to be a great size when you don't want to lug something big around.<br /><br />The screen is large, (2\") for its size and has good resolution.<br /><br />I have recorded a couple of movie clips, and at low res I could conceivably record for almost an hour on the 512 meg SD card I got at Costco for $54.  The included 16 meg card really doesn't hold enough shots to be useful.<br /><br />The optical zoom is the standard 3X.  Like most people I shut off the digital zoom because I like my pictures to look good, not like garbage.  Don't digitally zoom, just optically zoom and crop the picture with photo editing software.<br /><br />I have loved the pics I've taken with this camera.  The colors and resolution looked great.  I find I often shoot using the \"children and pets\" mode for the high speed shutter, and turn off the flash.  Not that the flash is too much, except way up close when ANY camera would give blown out pics- I just prefer using natural light when I can, and the good low-light capabilities of the camera allow for it.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, a battery charge indicator to give advance notice the battery is going to poop out would be nice.  A camera this small can't have a large battery, so you have to be conservative.  I turn off the imaging beam, and that seems to make a big difference in extending battery life.  Another feature that I miss compared to my Olympus is a button that takes you directly to viewing mode.  I find that I blast back and forth between shooting mode and play mode to make sure I got the shot I wanted, and that slide switch isn't going to last forever.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this camera to anyone who wants a lot of features and quality in a small package.","This is my fourth camera from the Canon Powershot line, I use the high end SLR Canons professionally but carry a small camera with me for that once-in-a-life time shot that might appear; typically I use one of the Canon Powershot line as the software is familiar to me and they're rugged.  I used the S40 for a year, the S50 for a month or so, and then the Powershot Pro1, all excellent cameras for their intentions.<br /><br />However, the SD300 will run rings around all of them, pointedly it has the instant on and instant auto-focus and immediate shooting that pros demand, but get only with the high-end SLR cameras, features that are sorely missing from the Powershot line.  The digital lag problem, typical in low end cameras, culminated in the Powershot Pro1 wherein the camera is un-useable for motion shots or in poor light (it's still-life capabilities are excellent though).  Now Canon has stuck their high end DIGIC processor and software in this cellphone-tiny Elph, since it has the same processor as the 20D, it feels closer to it in performance than it does to the rest of the Powershot line; indeed this is the first Powershot to have such a processor:  It shoots sport-photo fast, ie 5 frames at full resolution every two seconds with enough of a buffer to get a dozen or so shots before it slows down, each shot appears immediately on its large screen, another first.  It has an onscreen 9 point focusing (with green squares) that is user modifiable for the person-in-the-corner shot.  The flash is so good it should be an attachment:  shoots six different ways depending upon light conditions. My large hands had no trouble at all with the buttons, biggest problem I anticipate is forgetting its in my pocket and sending it through the laundry, its that thin!<br /><br />Now for the feature that none of the high end Canons have, including the multi-thousand dollar digital SLR line, and the other Powershots can only approximate:  a 60 fps movie mode, Holy Cow!  Shooting good quality slow motion movies with this credit-card-with-a-lens, what a hoot, it also shoots normal speed 30 fps for a 640x480 movies of surprising liquid-like evenness, there is no jerking even with rapidly moving objects.  So not only is it a stand by still camera, if you are a film maker who needs a light weight movie camera around for that once-in-a-lifetime scene stick this one in your wallet.  Home run for Canon.","So the reviews usually hype up things that end up not being that important afterall, but I just got this camera and it really does do all those things they said it would.<br /><br />The movie mode is amazing. I got a 1GB card and this doubles as my videocam.<br /><br />It can take really close up photos, which makes it very useful for work.<br /><br />Photo quality and color is great, as with all Canons I've used in the past.<br /><br />The burst mode really does work. I can take 10 photos in a few seconds while moving. I tested in this in the shop and got clear photos of the entire showroom.<br /><br />My other top choices were the CasioZ55 (gorgeous, but movie mode not as good), and the Pentax Option S5 (strange coloring, didn't like the last optio I bought for fathers day). In the end this Canon was the best choice by a slight margin and I got it for an amazing price.","If you are looking for a 4 megapixel camera that can do it all and also be super portable, the Canon SD300 is it.  My comments go double if you are considering the SD300 because of its very compact size.  When looking at its competitors, be sure to take into account the overall travel package including the battery charger, much like you would when deciding on portability of a laptop computer. For example, the Pentax Optio 4si and 5si cameras are about the same size and a touch lighter in weight, but they only come with bulky charging cradles that also need a bulky A/C cord. The SD300's charger, by contrast, is very compact; no bigger than the camera itself, and its plug swings out so you don't need any cord. The overall travel package of camera and charger is like carrying two tins of Altoids mints.  In fact, they will probably fit inside the tins.  Very portable.  The camera's performance is great. I considered, besides the Pentaxes, the Lumix FX7, the Sony T1 and Casio Z55, but I bought the Canon and am very satisfied with it, even though other cameras come in 5 mpxls whereas this one is 4 mpxls. Do I wish it had 5? Of course. But I find 4 mpxls is more than adequate for my needs and rarely if ever do I wish I had more.  You can easily go to 8x10 prints with 4 megapixels.","First of all, for anyone looking for a camera this tiny, you'd better understand that there will be compromises. Battery life, image quality, etc. This camera does not take pictures nearly as nice as my Powershot G5. I never expected it to.<br /><br />But for a super compact camera, it's absolutely amazing. Things that I really love:<br /><br />1) This camera is FAST. It starts up, and is ready to shoot, in about 1 second. My G5 takes about 3. In between pictures, you hardly have to wait at all. The new Digic 2 operating system is very snappy.<br /><br />2) The image quality, especially outside, is wonderful. There is some purple fringing that is common to a small lens, but you'll only see it where a bright edge meets a dark edge. And most of the time, it'll never appear.<br /><br />3) The movie mode ROCKS. Imagine, shooting 640x480 at 30fps with NO TIME LIMIT! I bought a 1 gig 66x SD card, and can shoot until the card is full. At full res, 1 gig will hold 8.5 minutes, which is actually pretty amazing considering this is a tiny compact camera. You can also shoot 60fps, for slow motion FX, but that is limited to 360x240.<br /><br />4) it's SMALL. Finally a camera that I can carry with me. It's about 30% thinner I think than the S400 S500 series cameras.<br /><br />5) Simplicity. Few buttons, and a very well laid out menu system. I never even cracked open the manual, no need. It's so easy to use.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased with this camera, and would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a super-small camera that takes great pictures.<br /><br />Don't expect it to get great battery life, especially if you're shooting with the LCD and Flash all the time.<br /><br />This thing is SOOO cool.","Handling:  The interface is similar to that in other Canon digital compacts, which helps your learning curve.  The case is in metal, except the USB and the battery cover.  They are both made of plastic and feel very fragile.  The metal tripod mount is located closely below the lens.  The LCD screen is reasonably viewable under daylight conditions.<br /><br />Canon celebrated that SD300 is the first compact that uses the DIGIC II processing, and with my experience so far, the camera does respond faster when compared with DIGIC based ones.  It however appears to be on par with recent Sony and Olympics models.  I did not measured the various response times scientifically however.<br /><br />Picture quality: Contrary to other comments, I was not \"blown away\" by quality of the pictures.  The lens produces not serious, but significant purple edges in bright sunlight, and shows problems with dark corners like other compacts.  Color production is rich with high contrast, a big plus.  Sadly I find the pictures appear noisy when taking under low light conditions.  I suspect either I have a faulty unit, or there are some design issues?<br /><br />Complaints:<br />* can't review picture histogram easily (two to three steps)<br />* noisy operations<br />* no battery level indicator<br /><br />So far I find the SD300 a good and decent pocket camera.  However in the same market (similar specs and price) there are many other choices, and the SD300 does not excel specifically in any area.<br /><br />-- UPDATE --<br />I used this camera frequently between October 2004 and January 2005, taking more than a thousand pictures for my trips around.  I report more experiences I have with this fun camera:<br /><br />* The lithium battery is surprisingly resilient in cold conditions.  I bought a spare battery for my ski trips, thinking that batteries die early in cold weather.  It was negative teens and I had no trouble taking more than 50 pictures during the day with one battery.  Very good indeed.  The auto white balance worked fairly well - some blue casts.  Make sure you increase the exposure compensation when taking pictures with snow backgrounds.  (I use +2/3 to +1)<br /><br />* The purple fringe symptom has been widely reported and I guess users have to live with it.  Else the camera proved to be good at determining exposure and delivering pictures with good color contrast.<br /><br />* As a compact camera it served my purpose well: taking pictures of interesting things I see everyday in my life.  Small and quick.  I find it difficult however to use SD300 with my gloves.  This is no criticism as small cameras all have small buttons, but I still remember how painful my hands were when I needed to take off my gloves to shoot pictures in the mountains.","This seems to be the perfect point and shoot from a feature standpoint (finally.. good movies too!).  However, early pictures from sites like dcresource.com show noticable blurring at the edge of pictures.<br /><br />Hopefully Canon will come out with an S-series equivalent that has a better lens.","Thank you Canon for finally making the camera I've been waiting for.  I have the Powershot S300 and anyone who owns a Canon camera knows the great quality of pictures their cameras take.  Even with just 2.1 mexapixels, I was able to take some really incredible photos.  My only complaints were that the screen size was too small,  you could only record for like 10 secs. of video at high quality no matter how big your CF card was,  and I was in the need for a camera with some more megapixels cause I want to get the new Canon i9900 printer that can make up to 13X19 borderless prints.  I was thinking about maybe getting the Sony Cybershot DSCW1 cause it has the features I was looking for but I read some bad reviews about the fuzzy and dark pictures that it takes,  and I really didn't want to stray from Canon cause of how happy I've been with their products.  So now they came up with the Powershot SD300.  It has 4.0 megapixels,  a huge 2\" LCD screen, and high quality video that can record at 640X480 at 30fps or 320X240 at 60fps for up to 3min. which is plenty of time for me.  And amazingly, this camera is even more compact than my S300.  So you can be sure that this camera will be on my Xmas list for myself this year and I would recommend to anyone looking to buy a point and shoot digital camera to wait for this bad boy to come out."]},{"name":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II","amazon_reviews":["The camera was in better condition than described in the listing, I couldn't be happier.","love it","Good camera.

I am having a lot of fun with the camera so far","I use the Canon EOS 1Ds Mark II to shoot everything from portraits, landscapes, and events. I am impressed with the camera's build and design.<br /><br />Pros:  Canon EOS 1Ds Mark II feels solid. There's no comparison with consumer-level digital SLR cameras. The camera has to be used to be appreciated.<br /><br />Cons:  Price will keep it out of the reach of everyone except professionals and a small number of amateur photographers.","I have been shooting with this camera for some time now, and I feel as though I have developed a good relationship with it. I am a wedding photographer, and while looking for a full frame camera I stumbled across the 1Ds MkII. For the sake of brevity, I have kept my review mainly to bullet points, as I find them easier to process!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Incredible build quality, weather-proofed, solid<br />- Ergonomic and comfortable design, even for long hours shooting<br />- Fantastic image quality, just outstanding all around<br />- Full frame sensor (is there any other choice?)<br />- 17MP resolution is more than you will ever need (most likely)<br />- Autofocus is incredibly fast and accurate<br />- Deals with Dynamic Range better than most other digital camera<br />- Built-in grip makes portraiture more than easy<br />- Very good battery life (14+hrs non-stop wedding)<br />- Non-electronic shutter sound (I hate the rebel's sound)<br />- Comes with DC Coupler for studio work<br />- Digital noise is decent up to 800ISO<br /><br />NEUTRAL<br />- 4fps for 11 RAW images<br />- Quite heavy, especially with L glass. Could be pro or con depending on how you shoot.<br /><br />CONS<br />- Small LCD (by today's standards at least)<br /><br />You need to know that the megapixel war going on between camera manufacturers is absolute marketing hype. It's true. Packing more pixels into the same size sensor DOES NOT GREATLY IMPROVE IMAGE QUALITY, in fact several of the latest professional DLSRs are being criticized for high digital noise, a byproduct of cramming megapixels in. 16MP is more than enough to print out large, movie poster sized images. I have printed LARGE canvas wraps for wedding clients and they look absolutely beautiful. This camera is not lacking in high-tech features, and even now in 2012 I find it more than enough.<br /><br />Overall if you have the cash to spare and you're not interested in video capabilities, skip the 5D Mkii and go with this camera. The autofocus is fantastic, the image quality beautiful, and all in all it is a joy to shoot with. This wedding photographer won't be using anything else until the newer 1D series drop in price!","Finding a 1Ds Mark II for $1800 was great!  I was prepared to send it back for the least defect, but I have found none so far.  The number of actuations was approximately 20,000, so for the non-pro that I am, I should get several years of use out of this camera.","the most outstanding camera i ever owned,or used.produces incredible image quality photographs.a world class camera that challenges any competitor brand in any situation.built to last for years.","I can't tell you much more than what other members have described.<br />But one look and read of the 1DsMkII reviews by hundreds of members currently running to get theirs vs a new 5D2 is simply amazing.<br /><br />There are now over 121 pages of how many people love this machine, and<br />I probably should not be showing this[...]<br /><br />Every positive word you read is true about this marvel.<br />I just did a wedding with over 1800 shots, and the battery never<br />showed signs of needing a charge. Plus it did all the action practice the day before.","I started out in 2005 with a 20D, at about the same time the 1ds MK II was released.<br /><br />Because this was a hobby of mine at the time, the 1ds mk II was way out of reach, both in terms of price, and due to the demand for good glass to go with it.<br /><br />I am used to the 20D's AA filter, for me it is a normal part of the work flow to apply default sharpening at the end of the job in PS.<br />For the dissapointed Kodak guy, I have to ask and point out two things;<br /><br />- What glass did you use? The 1ds MK II (and the MK III even more so) demand expensive, excellent glass. The large sensor and the resolution will put even the most expensive lenses to the test.<br /><br />- Did you apply default sharpening after post processing? Canon state that a unsharp mask / smart sharpen of about 300% 0.3px (tweak when needed) is necessary to combat the AA filter. If you do that, detail will jump out at you and make your jaw drop, seriously.<br /><br />For me the 1ds MK II experience has been a real treat. I bought mine summer 2007, well aware that the MK III was due to be announced.<br /><br />For me, the small percentages in resolution didn't matter (though the MKIII, as a total package, is a step up from the MK II). The MK II creates wonderful photos. I have used mine for landscape, macro, studio, product and animals so far and I love every pixel i get. Prints looks great, my 70-200 f 2.8 finally saw use as a portrait lens again and my 17-40 really goes super wide for landscape.<br /><br />The menu system's \"idiot proofing\" can be somewhat confusing at first and I miss my 20D control stick for the focus point selection, how ever; When you have used it for a while, the handling become second nature.<br /><br />I don't need a \"live view 42\" flat screen TV\" on the back of my camera as the new DSLR's have these days, draining the battery, so I am perfectly happy with the smallish one on the MK II. I use my screen for quick reviews/controls and to check the RGB histogram for exposure, the rest is done on the computer.<br /><br />I don't complain about size or weight and I don't see why one should when one is buying a camera one may use in a desert war -or to club down a potential mugger and take his photo afterwards. :)<br /><br />Seriously though; If you don't want a heavy full frame camera, go for the 5D (or the coming 5D mk II). I use my 1ds mk II with the 70-200 F2.8L, the 135 f2 L, 24-105 F4 L and the 400 5.6L and even though I get tired some times, I know that these various combos will produce pictures that will \"aw\" my clients.<br />- Besides, a little work out is good for everyone in a time when people are getting more obese by the minute.<br /><br />I give it 4 out of 5 stars (would give 4.5 if possible), deducting some of the points for the over complicated menu-control system as well as the missing control stick for the focus points. (The 20D had it, and was released at the same time, so IMO the 1ds MK II should have had it).<br /><br />At the time I am writing this review, a used 1ds MK II can be had for about 50% of it's introduction price.<br />If you are planning to step up from the 1D, 5D or the xxD/xxxD series, I would recommend this camera with no hesitation.<br />- Prepare to spend the money, saved on buying a used camera, on glass :)","I traded up from a nikon d100 and its been great.  a little trouble at first.  a very expensive long lens i bought was out of adjustment and vinnetting.  it took me a little while to figure out and i sent it back.  they broke it down and re-installed the elements and its been fine ever since.  news photography - aerial photography - artwork.  no problems with extreme cold (15F soaked) , moisture, heat or heavy use.  with a 1.4 lens its almost like night vision.  stuff that i can barely see well enough to focus  comes out well lit and not blurred while handheld. BTW i don't recommend a nikon.","I purchased this when it first became available a few years ago and loved it. I sold it a few months ago because I had convinced myself that it was more then I needed. After trying a 30D and a 5D, I sold them both and purchased another 1DS MARK II. When you own the best, you just can't settle for anything else. The absolute only feature I wish this had is the sensor shake to remove dust like the new models have. Other then that, this is the perfect digital camera. Do yourself a favor and use a high quality lens with it. The best deserves the best.","I have one, and I'm very happy while using it. I gave 4 stars ,cause of the price. I waited so long to get it.<br /><br />Mehmet Fatih KÜÇÜK<br /><br />turkey","As a photo gear junkie, I seem to go through cameras quickly. I buy - use - sell - upgrade... over and over and over. I have used the original digital rebel, the 20D, the 1DMarkIIN, and now the 1dsMKII.<br /><br />I was originally hesitant to drop the significant chunk of change required to own this product. Especially in the middle of a period of rumors circulating that the next evolution of the 1ds was coming soon. However - it was well worth the money.<br /><br />I shoot model based images primarly... so I need something that is portable, rugged, and wont die on me - on location.<br /><br />The battery lasts 8+ hours per charge - and charges incredibly quickly. I bought a spare... but I have only used it on travel weekends when I am away from a power supply for 2-3 days.<br /><br />Its rugged. There is nothing like the pro-series bodied by Canon. I have taken this camera out in the cold and snow - and in pretty heavy rain - and because of its weather sealing - it worked like a charm.<br /><br />Noise... this camera can shoot at H - which is the equivalent of ISO 3200. If you need to get the shot - and are in almost pitch black conditions - this baby can handle it. It will be grainy - but its a lot better than almost all of the other cameras out there. (I hear rumors that the 5D is better with LESS grain than this camera)... but then again - this is 16.7 megapixels.<br /><br />The amount of megapixels is phenominal... 16.7 - allows you to shoot a person and see all of their nosehair. While that may not sound flattering (and its not) - it means that with good glass this baby can capture even the subtlest of details.<br /><br />Last cool point... the dynamic range.<br /><br />You figure more digital cameras have a dynamic range of 5-7 stops. Film - 7-9 stops... This has got to have closer to 9 stops and is the BEST I have seen in a digital camera. I just recently got a medium format digital back - and that has 13 stops of dynamic range... but the 1dsmkii comes a heck of a lot closer to that without having to shell out 30k.","It seems unfair to compare this camera to a 10D (or 20D or 30D), either favorably or unfavorably. These instruments are good in their own right, but hardly  are in the same league as the 1DS Mark II. I have used all three of the xxD's, and an original 1ds body as well. It occurs to me that the folks who are interested in shelling out over 5 grand for a camera already have an idea about what they want, and that some of them are asking if they should trade in their 1ds body for a mark ii. It is to them that I am adressing this review. The remarks, I think will help those who have less experience with the line. Bear with me for the technical jargon and the emphais on Mark I vs II comparison. I want to help the buyer to decide if there really is a reason to spend this kind of money.<br /><br />First, regarding resolution: you probably won't be able to tell the difference between Mark I and Mark II unless you are doing studio work. An 8x10 image is virtually indistinguishable. Most of us shoot in .jpg mode, and we don't mess with RAW. If you are doing a 17x20 wedding portrait and are working with uncompressed files, the Mark II is superior. I do outdoor work, so 11.6 megapixels is plenty. Finallyl, the quality of the glass makes a big difference (much more than the sensor resolution), so if you are a little strapped for cash, buy a 5D and spend the difference on \"L\" series lenses, or a used 1DS (Mark I).<br /><br />Second: Ergonomics. I like the histogram on the Mark II better than the older camera, and appreciate the improved burst performance, and storage times. Small but significant differences. The battery life is way better, and I like that. I can get 700 frames out of a charge in the Mark II and only 200 from the Mark II. Thank you, Canon. Maybe in the next iteration they will do something with the black brick of a charger. I can only hope.<br /><br />Third: Sensor noise. Most ofthe high-end cameras are CMOS now, and each time we look at a new generation of pictures we are wowed by the decrease in sensor noise at high ISO's. I remember that the we praised the Mark I for the low noise up to ASA 400. For the uninitiated, sensor noise is the random firing of a sensor due to quantum effects, and manifests as sparkle or random changes in pixel color. It is more prominent in low light and high ASA. The Mark I is great up to ASA 400, good up to 800 and needs some digital filtering at 1200. The Mark II is really good up to ASA 1600, and with a Photoshop filter is good to 3200. If you shoot in low light, the Mark II is for you.<br /><br />Fourth: Color balance. I always loved the warm, saturated pictures that the Mark I gives, so don't get me wrong - better color rendition is not a reason to sell it for a new model. The Mark II, though, improves on it and gives beautiful color saturation with some improvement in the range of highligts. Digital photo buffs will know what I mean: if you take a picture with broad highlights, like a sky, the foreground objecst will be underexposed. and the highlights clear. Set the exposrue to the foreground, and the sky will be a burnt-out white. The Mark II has improved this much, but it still needs some work by Canon. For now, it helps to have taken a large number of pictures to get an idea as to how to set the exposure.<br /><br />Fifth: Accuracy of the exposure. The Mark I had an annoying tendancy to overexpose by about a stop. I got used to turning down the exposure 1-2 stops, exposing on the highlights, and using Photoshop to correct the exposure. The Mark II is more accurate, and the Manual exposure is close to the metered exposure.<br /><br />Sixth: The FF/1.6 business. I really don't see any reason that a 30D is a better camera because a 50mm lens gives an image analagous an 85mm lens in a full frame camera. Be advised, though, that lens evaluations depend on this distinction. Edge performance and flair may be more obvious on a full frame instrument. Both the 1DS and the 1DS Mark II tend to challenge lenses more because they work the full range of the lens from side to side and through the apertures. My 35-135 IS Canon lens gave great pictures on the 10D, but looks washed out on both of the 1Ds's. Before giving the 1DS Mark II a bum rap for less than perfect pictures, ask what lens was used.<br /><br />Seventh: Price. Presently, a non-grey-market 1DS Mark II sells for around $6899 from reputable dealers. A used Mark I is around half that. I would take a half star away from Canon for the pounding my pocketbook is taking, but I understand that a Mark I was just about the same price when it was released. The price gradient presently would be tolerable for those shooting in low light, or for RAW studio work. Personally, I would buy a Mark I over a 5D for the improved construction.<br /><br />Finally, some general remarks. I would have liked to compare this fine camera to the comparable Nikon. Unfortunately, I cannot, because all my glass is Canon, and I have no money left for a mult-thousand buck purchase of a Nikon. Maybe someone else would write a review.<br /><br />My only beefs with Canon have to do with sensor dust, that seems to appear by spontaneous generation, and the steep learning curve that I had with my first use. (Plan on a night or two reading the manual) I guess I can forgive them for not putting a flash in it. Add a couple of hundred to the price for the purchase of a 580EX. Canon service has been terrific. If you have the bucks, quit complaining about the price and get one if you are a serious photographer. Look at the images in dpreview.com (and the long, thoughtful review there), and at fredmiranda.com - they will leave you breathless. This is a serious instrument for serious photographers and far be it from me to give it less than 5 stars for my petty complaints.","Ive gotten used to the disposable kodaks i got from the checkout isle at walmart. The problem with those, though, is that they run out of pictures pretty quick. The last straw was when we ran out of film at the family reunion just as cousin billy was about to show us how to catch a lizard with a rubber band and a twinky. At that point I knew I needed an upgrade.<br /><br />I ordered the Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II the next day, for [...] The feature that first caught my attention was the powerful zoom. Now when I take a family picture, I like to step back about a mile or two, then zoom in and snap that high-resolution masterpeice. My wife always complains that i zoom too close into the big pores on her nose, to which i respond by suggesting she use clean and clear pore cleansing strips (watch for her upcoming review of those soon).<br /><br />Another useful feature of this camera is the continuous shooting mode. This is where the camera automatically takes pictures in rapid succession, about 5 per second. The other day I set the camera on the dresser, turned on the macarena, and got wild. I then took the individual pictures and strung them together into an animated flipbook. Now watching myself do the macarena is a mere flip of the book away. Man i can dance.<br /><br />To summarize, you will have a lot of fun with this cam like i did. Definitely worth the [...] ! But remember, there is a [...] that comes with it; so make sure you fill in the item number clearly on the [...] card, and make sure you stay within the space alloted on the form otherwise the [...] wont go through.","First, the Canon 1Ds Mark II is an awesome professional camera.<br /><br />This review is about the completely misleading Amazon offer of 42% off.  This is the biggest joke imaginable.  The Amazon website shows the list price as $11,999.99.  When Canon launched this camera the MSRP wasn't that high.  It was $7,999.  Methinks someone with a calculator got carried away.<br /><br />Anyway, after adding it to my cart to see the unbelievable low price it turns out its within about $100 of what every other reputable online shop is selling it for.<br /><br />I expected more from Amazon.  This behavior is reprehensible.","The Canon 1Ds Mark II does not list for $11,999. Body only it lists for around $7,500.","i think this is the BEST buy anyone can do, is superfast, flexible (50-3200 asa) interchangeble lenses, long last battery, all excellent, the only bad thing is the high price but it worth it, its like having a ferrari, almost you want to keep it at home in case that something bad happens like being stolen or damaged even do that some people say that the big size is an inconvinencie i personally would not like a tiny camera as a professional photographer it woud look ridicoulous, so the size is a good thing also, when people that even dont know the camera are impressed by the stuff it has.","This camera has the potential for pictures with amazing clarity and colors but not straight out of the camera.<br /><br />I too was disappointed after converting the RAW files with C1 Pro and ACR. Was it possible that my D-Rebel would be better than this monster that gives me neck pains and has made my right arm to start looking like Swartzenegger's arm? Even with L glass the results were dissapointing.<br /><br />The problem is not with the camera but with the workflow. After using it for 2 months I am getting used to a workflow that will give me the results I am looking for. I had to realize that this camera does not perform any processing enhancements in camera because the pros need to do it themselves. Once I got over the fact that I would have to sharpen and saturate colors a lot more than before I was content and have never touched the D-Rebel ever since.<br /><br />PS Beware of the severe neck pains when attaching any L zoom lens. Buy the hand strap or a better neck strap.<br /><br />Some photo samples can be found here:<br /><br />[...]","I have been shooting digital for four years now mostly with the Kodak DCS cameras(660 through DCSPro). Being a life long Nikon guy it was a big decision to make the switch to Canon and the 1DS MK2. This camera is light years ahead of any Kodak digital slr. I use this camera for studio product, models, location, low light, you name it. The Canon has never produced anything but astounding images for me. All image parameters including sharpness are far superior to any of the old images I have from my Kodak days. Yes it is pricey but if you are working with this camera you will pay for easily long before it's useful days are over.","I purchased this camera online one month ago from amazon here<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />And I have taken pictures from Alaska to Florida and in Washington I love how the Mark II captures images IMHO more clearly than any film SLR could ever take.<br /><br />Best Camera I have every used","I had read every review of this camera and was sure it was the one for me.  I had been using a Kodak DCS Pro 14n and thought the higher res of the Canon would be an improvement.  Immediately after shooting some studio shots, I only shoot products, I was disappointed with the softness of the images.  I compared them with the crisp sharp photos of my Kodak and became very dissatisfied.  I thought the Canon must be defective, or maybe some kind of setting was wrong tried every sharpening technique, using Canon's software and Photoshop.  These helped but still the images had an overall soft looked which were unusable to me.  I returned the camera.  I went back and reread the reviews.  To my own surprise each reviewer had mentioned this soft look and I had not realized what they meant.  This seems to be a choice Canon made, something to do with the IR filter and moire effects.  I went back to my Kodak and am much happier.  At low ISO settings the Kodak outperforms the Canon for studio product work.  I think the softness of the Canon's images would better suit a portrait artist then my type of work.  I did not test the Canon at high ISO settings but I do know that the Kodak adds to much noise so the Canon may be a better choice for those needing faster ISO numbers.<br />Digital Photographer Magazine (\"Kodak vs. Kodak Which 13.5MP DSLR Takes The Sharpest Prints?\") did a good review of the new Kodak DCS SLR's and called them the \"sharpest\" of all digital SLR's, sharper then this new Canon, and these new models have less noise as well.  I am sure if you do not have the images side by side you would not realize the difference but I had the luxury of comparing.  It was painfully obvious that the Kodak was sharper.","I am a Pro Photographer who formerly used Medium Format. I wanted to get a digital SLR with better than film quality. The EOS 1Ds MK II is it!<br /><br />It is weather/dust resistant (to a point) when combined with Canon's \"L\" series lenses, and if you own this body, those lenses are a must-have. The controls are easier to master than I first thought. It is fast, no shutter lag and fast write to card. The colors and details in shadow/highlights are amazing! Truly a joy to hold!<br /><br />If you want the best, this is it.","I bought this camera after using the Canon EOS 10D for commercial photography, and I'm really impressed by its performance. If I were to list the top things I like about it, I would say:<br /><br />- Resolution. The camera (almost) produces A3 @ 300dpi images. That satisfies most advertising needs.<br /><br />- Wide Dynamic Range. The color tones and wide color gamut help produce amazing images in all color spaces.<br /><br />- Speed. (1)Startup speed is wonderful, I set the energy saver to shutdown the camera after 1 min of inactivity and it starts up immediately after a lightly touching the shutter release button. (2)The other thing is the 4 fps; I thought it would be too slow for sports, but it's not. (3)Last but not least, AF speed, it's almost instantaneous.<br /><br />- Built like a tank. The camera's weather seals are also very important to me. I live in a desert environment, so it gets very dusty especially when doing outdoors photography. Of course changing lenses outdoors for me is risky since it's a chance for dust to get into the chamber and then onto the sensor, So be careful.<br /><br />- Full Frame. The experience of the lenses brings you back to film cameras. The 10D had a x1.6 crop factor (17mm is actually 27.2mm), but with the 1Ds Mark II 17mm is 17mm and that made me utilize the lenses I had better.<br /><br />I hope I was able to convey some of the joy I'm having with it.. The only bad thing I find in this camera is its price.. But with all things considered, I think it has the value for it.","I recieved my 1DsMkII on 21 Nov 04. My previous digital SLR was a Canon 10D and I have a film based Hassleblad, which I don't use much any more.<br /><br />So far I can find no camera imposed limitations to my photographs (except I can never have enough resolution). I have full use of my wide angle lenses again. I love this camera.<br /><br />Some notes: unlike my 10D, the speed of compact flash cards make a huge difference with the 1DsMkII, I recommend at least a 40X or faster, don't use a standard CF card with this camera there is a noticeable speed difference (can you say turtle). My Lexar 40x card seems to do a decent job keeping up with the camera given my normal shooting style, but is still not fast enough to truly keep up with the camera in full continuous mode.<br /><br />This is not a light camera and the controls take some getting used to coming from the D60/10D realm, but they seem better laid out for my use. Although the manual and autofocus on the camera is noticeably better then my older camera, I upgraded the focus screen (to Ec-b) because my eyes tend to adjust to the lens and I can now manually focus. Upgrading the focus screen was not something I could do with my D60 or 10D and I had problems with manual focus because of this.<br /><br />This camera takes fantastic pictures. It is near-IR sensitive (although not as much as my 10D), so some near-infrared pictures are possible. For a multi-purpose camera this is THE 35mm camera for all but some sports and photojournalist photographers. In the studio, I am of the opinion, it can replace many medium format film systems as well. Although a bit pricey, it is well worth the money. I highly recommend this camera for the serious photographer.","I have just given the camera back to my cousin who works for Canon head office. He brought the new 1Ds Mark II home for the long weekend. First of all the camera is not light. I tried it with the 70-200 2.8L IS lens..great pictures in low light, obviously helps if the lens is fantastic also ! Startup time is very fast. No real distracting noise on shutter, easy to hold. Good recovery time shot to shot, menu system set out logically. Many shooting options, my favorite one being the x-ray option. Not sure if this will still be offered when camera goes on sale but it's totally cool option. If you can get your subject to drink liquid dye the pics that come out are like from a science fiction movie !! Overall impression was that it is a must have camera."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 4800","amazon_reviews":["Nikon quality in a camera w/ a built-in viewfinder","I love it but you can only use up to 2 gig sd","The best camera I have owned, bar none.

Great picture with true colors. A truly outstanding product.  Nikon does not make these kind of camera's any more at a low price point.","AAA+++ Would buy from this supplier without hesitation!!!","Still love this camera in 2011! I lost my battery charger (still on my original battery from 2004 or 2005 - whenever it was I bought this camera). I just ordered a new battery charger from a seller on Amazon. I hope it will work because I'd hate to have to replace this camera.","This is my second one of this camera (my first one was stolen). I was so happy with the quality of the pictures that the camera takes that I wanted no other. The lens is really extraordinary. All my pictures are crystal clear and have vibrant  colors. Plus, having a view finder really helps in bright sunlight.","I got this camera 6 years ago, and have taken literally thousands of photos with it. With very few exceptions, I've been extremely happy with its design and performance. Yes, it's a bit bulky by current standards, but one of the reasons I bought it is that it's shaped like a camera, not like a cell phone (I often take photos one-handed). I have used almost every mode, but I use the macro (close-up) the most. I have received many compliments on some incredible close-ups I've taken. Regular AA batteries would be nice, I'll admit. Battery life has been excellent, but is finally starting to wane- to be expected after 6 years, but it still gets me through a normal day of sightseeing. Movie quality isn't great, but it's ok. One of the best features is the viewfinder (almost impossible to find anymore on all but full size SLRs). It even has a diopter adjustment, allowing me to take off my glasses and still see clearly through it. In conditions that wash out screens, I can take great photos while those around me are just hoping for the best. Using the viewfinder, I can also take photos without having a bright screen shining in my face and attracting attention. It has the option of displaying the same information as the screen. I can't believe that viewfinders are no longer available. I once dropped this camera on a hiking trail (a pretty hard, tumbling landing), with no functional damage, just some scratches. Overall, this camera has been a bomb-proof workhorse, and I get positive comments on the camera and photos even to this day.","I was looking for a camera specifically to take fishing.  I'm a fly fisherman and the camera I have been using is just too heavy, too bulky, and too expensive to carry on the river.  This camera offered me a view finder, which I prefer; adequate resolution, a great lens with a very healthy optical zoom.  Although somewhat dated technologically, it gives me everything I want and I'm not afraid of drowning it if I take a fall.","This is a great camera with many options and settings to take wonderful pictures, indoors or out.  It has more optical zoom than other cameras in this price range, adding greater resolution to enlargements.","The picture quality is superb.  The features are easy to use.  Our first set of pics looked studio quality.","I've played with this camera a few weeks now and the zoom is great.  It has various scenes to choose from to help you take pictures in different settings, lighting, scenery, etc. and it works very nicely.  I haven't installed the software, but loading pictures to my computer is very easy.  The battery seems a little high maintenance, but its just a matter of not storing it inside the camera.  Overall, its a nice, easy to use camera for snapshots for novices, and the extra zoom makes it all the better.","I do a lot of hiking and was looking for something lighter weight than an SLR that would still allow me to take telephoto and macro shots.  This camera is the smallest and lightest one I found that has a 8X or higher zoom.  I have taken very sharp telephoto photos of wildlife and macro shots of flowers that people thought were taken with a high-end camera.  This camera does well with conventional landscapes and indoor flash snapshots.  The menu controls are very easy to use and there are enough presets for special situations to compensate for lack of manual controls.  However, if you mostly take snapshots that do not require 8X zoom, I would look to other models.  While, this is small for a long zoom camera, it is still too big to easily fit in a pocket or purse.<br /><br />The primary flaws of this camera:  It is only 4 megapixels.  The battery charger failed and had to be replaced about 18 months after purchase (This was particularly a problem since the camera takes a propietary battery rather than AAs).  The delay in taking pictures is longer than many competitors.  Occasionally the lens cap does not open completely (easily fixed if you notice it before snapping your picture).","I had a HP that took okay pictures but close-ups were blurry. I tried the Kodak Easy Share. The pictures were \"okay\" but it took a very long time to transfer them. Close ups were a little blurry.<br /><br /> Deceiding that Kodak was not a wise choice.It was then I recalled the best photos I have ever taken were with a Nikon Pictures that looked as good and some even better than<br /><br />postcards. Seriously! I ventured out one more time to buy a digital camera I would try one more. Thankfully, Nikon stopped my camera blues. This camera has alot of great features. It works great on small items like jewelry. I am very happy with<br /><br />the quality. Although it is a little bigger than the other two<br /><br />digitals I bought, I do not mind. If you are not concerned with quality and want a camera that will fit in your pocket then buy HP or Kodak. Do you want Sharp vibrant pictures? If, yes.<br /><br />Here is your answer.","This camera works like a charm. You can change the pictures to black & white, sepia, and cyanotype (which makes the picture blue) This camera is just a lot of fun to use, and I've actually got some pro-quality images with am amateur camera! But even though it's 'amateur' and some of you wat to go more of the 'pro-way' I would suggest this camera first. I personally prefer SLR cameras, but this one was just too good. There are so many things you can do on this camera on all the modes, and everyone I know wants to get a camera like mine. My brother even got one! I highly suggest this camera to anyone wanting to get some good shots. THe only problem with it is that it's a bit slow. Sometimes it flashes numerous times, then finally takes a picture. However, there are a couple modes that allow you take take very quick picture, like within a second.<br /><br />This is the camera that you should get. You may not be quite as happy as I am with any other camera!","I just bought this camera so this review might be changing in the near future.<br /><br />What I love:<br /><br />-8.3x optical zoom. Enough Said.<br /><br />-Menu systems. They are pretty self explanitory, though reading the manual is helpful, especially if your not electronics saavy.<br /><br />-Lightweight. It's lighter than my smaller Kodak digital camera.<br /><br />-Macro Mode. My favorite feature. The macro mode is absolutely amazing. I love being able to photograph jewelry with much sucess along with insects and flowers. A great feature and that alone is well worth the money.<br /><br />-The Price. I got a great deal on my camera at just 214.00 at a major retail store. I wanted something that I could take to sporting events without dragging around my heavy, professional SLR. I think I've found it.<br /><br />-I like the way it feels. This might sound a little weird, but the camera fits well in my hands. It's comfortable to use.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br />-Size. OKay, I'm not really that conserned with the size, mostly because I drag a Pro SLR almost everywhere I go, but it's a big downfall for this camera. Bigger and bulkier than most of the camera's in it's class. Not easily able to fit in pockets or purses.<br /><br />-Software. I'm really not to fond of the picture project that came with the camera. I'm a big fan of the EasyShare (Kodak) software that came with my second digital camera. The layout for picture project just doesn't appeal to me.<br /><br />-Slow transfer. It took forever it seemed like to transfer my pictures. I have a top of the line computer, so I know it's not my computer. Right before I transfered my Nikon pictures, I had transfered my Kodak pictures and they transfered much quicker.<br /><br />-Rechargable Battery Pack and 2CR5 batteries. I don't really have  any trouble with the battery life (I'm actually amazed at how GOOD it is) but I'm just not in to the rechargable packs. I like the AA battery type. They are easy to find both regular and rechargable. My real gripe is that this camera does take a throwaway battery: the 2CR5. They are expensive. They are hard to find. They don't last very long.","I bought this Nikon 4800 last month(NOV)for my trip to Disney. It took great outdoor pictures, inside some pictures turned out blurry. The battery life is very good. The in camera redeye reduction worked pretty well. The menu is very easy to navigate. My main reason for buying was the 8.3x zoom, it worked great. Overall I'm very pleased so far with the Nikon 4800.","I bought Nikon Coolpix 4800 digital camera about two weeks ago.<br /><br />The most important feature I looked forward to was the 8.3x optical zoom. The picture quality has been great and the menu is easy to use. The camera body is very handy and user-friendly. The battery charges quickly and lasts long. The user manual is simple and easy to understand. Excellent video quality is an added bonus!<br /><br />One improvement I would like to suggest to Nikon is making the lens cover more robust or providing an additional cap.<br /><br />For users, using a tripod for full zoom is recommended.<br /><br />All in all a great camera!","I just received my camera 2 days ago and immediately I began to test it.<br /><br />It is very nice and it feels very nice to hold.<br /><br />I like that the zoom stops when it reaches the maximum of the optical zoom (if you keep pressed for 1 second it will go to the digital zoom).<br /><br />The battery last for more than 200 shots which is not bad at all. It charges in less than 2 hours.<br /><br />The quality of the pics is excellent.<br /><br />Please read the manual so you can obtain professional photos.","I previously owned the Olympus c2100 - loved the macro and image stabilization. I could have purchased a camera with more mega pixels for less money, but the optical zoom was really important to me and Nikon is known for good optics. I purchased this digital camera because of the 4MP, automatic settings, and 8.3 optical zoom. I have been using it for the past couple of weeks and find it to be very versatile. The auto settings do a good job and the ability to over ride the auto works well. I purchased one of the faster 1GB SD cards as well as 2 extra rechargeable batteries. Even using the zoom and electronic through the lens viewfinder, the batteries have a much better life than the AA's in my previous camera. The two drawbacks are the lack of image stabilization and the lack of ability to view pictures already taken through the Electronic Viewfinder - viewing is only available via the LCD monitor which I find difficult for assessing picture quality in bright sunlight. Overall, if you are interested in a compact camera with better than average optical zoom with multiple extra features, I would recommend this as a good buy.","I really like this camera. Amazon did everything they said they would. It was a great experience.","I absolutely love this camera. I would recommend a good case if you plan on using this as a daily \"in your purse\" type camera and the lense doesnt have very good protection (just some plastic shutters). This camera takes great pictures and does video as well. It is very user friendly and I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a new digital camera!!!!","If you're looking for a great digital camera, you found it.  This Nikon takes amazing pictures.  It's a 4 mega pixel,which takes great pictures by itself,  but the HUGE selling point is the 8.3 optical zoom.  You can get in super close and see every detail.  I can't tell you enough what sharp, clear, pictures this camera takes.  You don't have to be a pro.  You can set it on automatic and let it do all the work for you.  I also bought the camera bag with extra battery, something else i highly recommend.  Read the manual, because there's so much this camera does, you'd be cheating yourself out of some great features if you didn't.","I bought this camera before leaving the country. Now that I'm back and am looking at the pictures I took, I am amazed. The quality of the pictures  is great, and the zoom works very well. There are almost no blurry images no matter how much zoom I used as long as I used the right setting, which was always easy to get to.<br /><br />The only problems were that it is a little larger than most other cameras, and the battery life was less than expected. I made sure to buy a second battery, which was essential, and I also had the car charger. Whether at home or in the car, I could charge one battery while using the other. I found that if I left the battery in the camera, the battery would be dead in a few hours. We made sure to remove the battery when we were not about to take a picture and put it in the case, which had enough room for the battery and camera in the main compartment and a spare battery and spare memory card in the front compartment.<br /><br />All in all, I am very pleased with the camera. I did not find the battery issue to be too bad, and I think the camera itself is worth the price. Hopefully someday digital cameras will be able to hold their charge for a longer time. Until then, I recommend this camera to anyone looking for a powerful zoom at a good price.","I bought this camera for four reasons:<br /><br />1. I wanted a back-up camera for my Coolpix 8700.<br /><br />2. I wanted the 8X optical zoom lens (like my 8700).<br /><br />3. I wanted a Nikon for similarity of operating systems.<br /><br />4. My wife wanted an easy-to-use camera she could carry in her purse.<br /><br />After having taken a number of photographs with this camera, I am very pleased.  It does everything I wanted it to do and more.  The quality of the photographs is excellent (4MP), and it uses the same EN-EL1 battery as my 8700 (I have 5 of them).<br /><br />My step-son took the camera out without any instructions a few evenings ago and came back with some great sunset photographs.<br /><br />While the camera is not as small as the 3X optical zoom cameras, the camera is a good size and will fit in her purse.  I prefer the larger size, because it's easier to hold steady while shooting.<br /><br />In addition, the fully automatic mode is great for my wife, who is a digital photography novice, but wants to come with me and share my photographic excursions.<br /><br />Having a common operating system with my 8700 (minus some advanced features) makes answering her questions easy, and makes changing settings for her both quick and effortless.<br /><br />I would buy this camera again.","I'm a big Nikon SLR fan, and knew I eventually had to move into the \"digital age.\" With this camera, I'm not sorry I did!<br /><br />I knew I wanted something that had some features like an SLR without the price. The zoom on this camera is terrific - even better, in my opinion, than the Canon Rebel, which is a lot more money and considered a true digital SLR. The Nikon is relatively lightweight without being too compact, and I find its size perfect enough to feel more like a \"real\" camera than some of the smaller models. It also has a nice-sized viewing screen. You can either use the screen to take pictures or switch to the viewfinder, which is a nice option for when you want to take close-ups.<br /><br />I also like how you can switch the ISO ratings from 50 to 400, much like an SLR. I picked this one because some of the others I looked at didn't go above 200 and this one does. In 4 mgp mode the camera also produces beautiful quality prints, in my opinion. I was stunned at how good they looked, just like film-quality.<br /><br />I don't find the battery life a problem. Maybe if you're using the flash alot and/or have the pixels at their highest setting. Battery usually charges in about two hours, which isn't bad. I keep a backup point and shoot in my bag and have only had the battery die once, simply because I was in a hurry and refused to heed the warnings the display readout gives you. The camera shot pictures up until the bitter end and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Possible cons:<br /><br />The movie mode is adequate, not the greatest - but then this camera is more about taking pictures than movies. I use it a lot for taking short clips of my son and then burning them to DVD.<br /><br />Internal memory is a bit on the skimpy side but nothing a bigger memory card can't fix.<br /><br />All in all, a great camera for the money.","If you are looking for a easy to use, point and shoot camera with good optical zoom(8.3), this is the rigth camera for you. I bought last week and took some awesome picture just clicking it on auto mode without any adjustments. You can see my pictures at amazon.com. I used Nikon3200 ealier but this is better than that. I highly recommend this camera.","I just love my Coolpix 4800. It is everything I'd hoped it would be. The 8.3X zoom and 1/2\" close-up capability features are not ones that I use everyday, but it's nice to know they are there and I have used them many times in the 4 months I've owned it.<br /><br />The coolpix 4800 takes great pictures. It is easy to use for a point and click person like my wife and has more special modes than I'll ever use. The size and weight are just right. Not so small and light that you might drop it and not so heavy that you get tired using it.<br /><br />As an amateur genealogist, I appreciate the special \"Copy\" or document mode for taking pictures of book pages and documents in genealogical histories and libraries where flash is prohibited. I researched many digital cameras in the 3-4 mpix range before buying and know I got the right one.<br /><br />If it has a negative, for me, it would be the proprietary EN-EL1 battery pack instead of AA's. However, I get very good life from the battery pack and I keep a spare standard 2CR5 Lithium battery handy which I pop in for a few shots whenever I need to recharge the EN-EL1.","I bought it mostly for the optical zoom, I can't complain about this, it is very good optical zoom, good macro, EXCELLENT pics without flash, very sensitive ccd, even without tripod. Easy to use. I used it for 3 consecutive days with LCD ON all time without charching battery. Great to have internal memory in case you can't afford an additional memory. Only problem is that doesn't work as a webcam or as a live camera connected to a pc, for video capturing, :(. NIkon review this please.","This is my third Nikon Coolpix camera, with my others being the 775 and 995.  I am quite disappointed with this camera.  The autofocus has so far given poor results.  I frequently take photographs outdoors, and even scenic photos are not crisp when using the automatic or various scene or mode settings.<br /><br />There are several annoying design flaws. The telephoto zoom rocker button is very sensitive.  It is far too easy to go over the line into the digital zoom from the optical zoom.  The button is too close to the top of the camera, and it's also easy to hit when you are pushing the shutter release. The knob used to focus the built-in viewfinder is tiny and hard to adjust; it is simply not possible to adjust it when your eye is actually up to the viewfinder.  I miss the old split-body design that allowed you to adjust the angle of the screen.  The screen on this camera is not sharp and viewing suffers from not being able to tilt it.<br /><br />Menus, which I thought were pretty good and fairly easy to use in previous Coolpix cameras, are just as good on this model, perhaps a bit improved.  Overall, though, I'm just not impressed with this model.","First off, let me point out that John A. Wincek in an earlier review gave a misleading account of dpreview.com's review of the Coolpix 4800.  Yes, the 4800's noise level at ISO 400 was higher than the Canon camera dpreview used for comparison, but not to the level of total trash as Wincek seemed to be implying.  And dpreview points out that the 4800 uses less noise reduction than the competition (all digital cameras employ some kind of in-camera noise reduction algorithm to \"filter out\" noise.)<br /><br />Ok, what really surpised me about the 4800 was how big it was.  I mean, it still qualifies as a small point-and-shoot, but given how it looks like the Coolpix 3200 and 4200, I thought it was going to be sub-compact, but I was wrong.  It's big enough that it won't fit in a pocket.  The lens compartment protrudes.  Together with the grip, the camera is quite deep at over 2 inches.  This does give a good grip and you can use it in one hand -- it weighs about 11 oz. with the LiIon battery.<br /><br />The 8.3x optical zoom is awesome.  Its 35mm equivalent is 36-300.  Because the 4800 doesn't have an image stabilizer -- a controversial feature among photo enthusiasts -- you MUST use a tripod or place the camera on a steady surface if you are to use the tele end of the zoom.  At anything over 6x zoom, your handshakes will magnify many times and result in blurry photos, no matter how well lit the scene is.  One problem with the 4800 is when you are beyond 6-7x zoom, focus feels slow and keeps flipping, which is very frustrating.<br /><br />The all-plastic camera feels solid but the decision to use proprietary LiIon rather than AA disappointed me, as I have a good collection of AA NiMH batteries and older Coolpix models used such batteries.  Battery life is respectable; I got over 100 shots mostly with flash and I zoomed in and out a lot.  (I hate to say this, but \"Camera buff\" was probably lying about recharging every six pictures, unless he/she got a defective unit or didn't know what he/she was doing.)<br /><br />The upshot is, if you want a power zoom in a small package, the 4800 is worth a look.  On the other hand, its relative bulky size, so-so picture quality and the lack of a optical viewfinder (an electronic one doesn't cut it for me) make it less attractive to someone seeking a sleek, compact point-and-shoot.  Its lack of controls over picture-taking makes it unsuitable for serious photographers.","First off, let me point out that John A.

It takes excellent pictures in all the conditions I've used it for.  This camera is a great combination of small size, yet powerful zoom.  I haven't had a problem with pictures blurring when zoomed in all the way, which is a big plus!  I'd highly recommend it.  The cost is a deal, when you consider all the features!","I have been wanting to upgrade my Coolpix 2100 for awhile but just didn't see anything from Nikon that made me want to spend my money... The Coolpix 5200 seemed a good choice, but I found a couple of reviews on line that said it was good but not great... And I wanted great... I liked the Coolpix scene selections and menu options, I had grown used to them, almost second nature, and that kept me from looking at other brands... I like Nikon... Then I found the Coolpix 4800... It's like the next generation Coolpix... For a really good review of the Coolpix 4800 Check out:<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />I read Steve's Review and went right out to Cir. City in Hollywood to buy my own Coolpix 4800... It's everything I wanted in my next digital camera and more, plus it's a Nikon... The only thing I added to the purchase was a 512 memory card... I'm a happy camper."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 8400","amazon_reviews":["I collect older Cameras , in this case a Nikon Coolpix 8400 ! 24-85mm , 8MP and in LN- Condition from KEH !

But -- it was being discontinued at that time and all of the remaining Nikon stock was bought by Ritz and put on sale for less than half of list. So I am skeptical that it is still being sold new and am surprised at the price. As far as some comments on the shutter lag -- if the previous shot has finished saving and if you have pressed the shutter half way down to track and focus on your subject and allow the flash to pop open, when the moment is right and you press the shutter fully the lag is negligible. Otherwise if you depress the shutter in one go there will be an additional 1/2 to 1 second lag for auto focusing which can take longer in dim light plus the time for the flash to automatically pop open.  If the previous picture hasn't finished saving then it will take seconds before your next picture especially if you have a very large memory card. This is true with nearly all digital cameras.  The very best feature is the swiveling LCD screen.  It swivels closed for protection and swivels out for viewing and can be rotated up and down and even all the way around to the front.  This means you can hold the camera above your head or down to the ground or even facing you and still see the screen.","Awsome wide angle camera that is serving my purposes just fine.

I agree fully with other positive reviews.<br /><br />The Amazon site lists the Hitachi microdrive (a high-capacity substitute for a compact-flash card) as an 8400 accessory, however, it proved incompatable, producing a \"This card cannot be used\" error message on the 8400.  So, skip the mircrodrive, and just get an extra 512k or larger compact-flash card.","I switched to digital a few years ago, and my little Olympus was fine for outdoor shots, but I missed my old Pentax Spotmatic, especially indoors without a flash.  I got this camera because of the recent lowered price.  I am very pleased that with the Nikon it's like having my old camara back, but with digital. It does everything extremely well, and learning the operation was simple.  I especilly like the P mode. I was worried that the steep discount in price meant something was wrong with the camera, but this doesn't seem to be the case.  Comparing it to similarly priced digitals, this is a great buy!<br /><br />People seem to be going for the big telephotos, but the wide angle lens is very handy. And I always wanted a Nikon...","I bought this camera to replace a high MP Sony pocket camera, and I am thrilled with it.  The picture quality is absolutely gorgeous in any lighting.  The red eye reduction really works, and gets rid of the red-eye before it ever gets to the memory card.  It has a compact flash card memory system, which is great because big compact flash cards are much more afforadable than the other types of cards.  This camera is better than my brother's Canon SLR in terms of picture quality, but not nearly as bulky and cumbersome.  The battery life is fantastic.  One other nice feature is the screen at the top of the camera which lets you see how many pictures you have, and the batter life, mode, etc without opening the screen.  The only drawbacks to this camera are (1) not the biggest zoom lens, but plenty enough for the typical photographer, (2) the screen could be bigger, but still acceptable, and (3) when you have the screen open, you can't use the viewfinder, which is a little annoying, but not a big deal.  I have owned 4 other high-end digital cameras and this is by far the best one I have ever used.","The wide angle lens is great for taking closeups and fitting everything in the shot. The auto mode is good for outdoor shots, not so good for indoor. I am learning how to control the camera manually for taking indoor shots with low lighting situations. There are too many setup choices on this camera for the beginner. The 8400 definitely has a learning curve to the controls. It would have been a big plus to include a custom case with this camera. I hope to master the controls and user setups on the Coolpix, I feel it has a lot of potential.","I own both the Nikon 8800 and 8400. These cameras are a perfect pair with the 8800 telephoto capabilities and the 8400 wide angle. If I had to choose between the two, I'd go with the 8400. It is smaller, lighter and can be dropped in a coat pocket. Both cameras can go between full manual to completely auto. There are a good number of scene modes as well. In essence they are identical other than the zoom and image stabalization on the 8800 (necessary with the 10x zoom).","And after having a Nikon 950 for a number years, it was time to just move up.  The one thing that I did buy with my N950 was a fisheye lense, which I really enjoyed.  But after a while those fisheye picture really got kinda boring, but what I really enjoyed the most out of it was the Wide Angle'ness of the lense.<br /><br />Most camera only give you 28mm worth of lense, but the one thing that sold me on this camera was that it did go down to 24mm and I wanted my next camera to have that movie mode.  A trival feature for some folks, but as Compact Flash cards get cheaper by the day.  Having a digital camera with a 60 sec (30fps movie is alot of fun, which is the TV standard),  There is also a 15fps mode which is idea for sending over the internet via e-mail (cable modem best required as we're talking about a 30 second flick weighing in at about 3MB in length)...But, I don't have any problems using my local dial up... but it's just takes longers to upload and download.<br /><br />But, the 24mm and 8 Megapixel, which in most regard captured photos in the ISO rating of 50.  Which if you know photography this is superb for capturing colors and definition.  If your looking for a camera shooting far away shots, this probably isn't it.<br /><br />I prefer to shoot people and large machines with in a 50 feet distance...  However, this is a real dandy for photographic the wide open great outdoors mountain top/city scapes skylight photos.  Every photographer is different in what they shoot.<br /><br />I also like to zoom in on a macro mode and photograph ants and little bugs.  They just make for interesting photographs.  This lense is tight and I love how they (Nikon) has listen to the photographers over the year in pointing out what would make a camera easy to operate and very functional.  Once you master this electronical beast, which is pretty straight forward easy.  Well then, you'll see how fast you'll get hook on using it.<br /><br />Alot of photographers on several of the digital camera review online sites have some really great reviews online.  But take them all with a grain of salt.  Will you really be worried about a 1/8 second lag in your shutter.  I won't.<br /><br />I was seriously considering getting a Nikon D-70, and having the flexibility of a variety of lense.  But, in all reality, I found by the time you had to tote around all your gear and worry about getting it ripped off.  Photography, by and whole wasn't worth the time of day.  However, if you can buy something with a great lense attached to it and a functional device... Well, then you'd have the perfect set up.  The D70 is a sweet camera to hold in your hand but, if you looking for something way more function without the big price tag, take a look at the 8400 or the 5400.<br /><br />Granted, this camera doesn't look cool like a DSLR, but I perfer to choose the easy of use and fuction over a big bulky DSLR and also, if your a world traveler, all theives know SLR are worth a lot more than these boring looking cameras,,,which pack alot of punch.<br /><br />Also..one more thing I like about this camera is the LCD panel that can adjusted to your line of sight.  The DSLR LCD window are built into the body of the camera...  Thus, when shooting over a crowd of people you can visually see what your aiming at and equally so, when you set the camera on the ground - you don't have to lay on your belly to see what the camera is focused on.  So, if you say a ship mechanic and need to take a picture in a small space, this camera allow you the flexibility to focuse on the hard to reach subject.<br /><br />Also the D70 doesn't have a movie mode.<br /><br />Now go check out those other reviews!!"]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 8800","amazon_reviews":["Great camera","Terrific product indeed","Excellent Camera received in excellent condition!","I finally found the solution to the problems created by pocket-size cameras I can't use because they look the same on the front, back, top and bottom.

I would use this company again for future purchases.","My Nikon 8800 has traveled from the Amazon basin to the North Slope of Alaska and has taken over 100,000 photos.  It has spent about a month in the hot, humid Amazon basin, a place which claimed the life of one of my past cameras.  I've used it so much, I actually wore out one battery pack and had to replace it.  Still, three years later the camera is functioning perfectly, just the way it did in the summer of 2004 when I bought it.  This camera has been very reliable.<br /><br />The image stabilization is extremely helpful in taking butterfly photos, the project I'm working on with this camera.  I also use it to record interesting birds, so I can look them up in a field guide at home.  With the image stabilization, I truely don't need to bring binoculars.<br /><br />It is far lighter and easier to transport than SLR type cameras.  I find this very helpful.<br /><br />To improve this already excellent camera, I suppose that it would benefit from a bigger LCD monitor, stronger external battery pack, and screws for a cable release.<br /><br />Also, in a perfect world, it would become a bit more light sensative and function better in darker conditions, or allow faster shutter speeds/greater depth of field.  Maybe that science fiction type function will become possible some day, but whatever the case, I just love this camera as it is right now.  It makes possible butterfly photography at resolutions and distances that were completely impossible just a few years ago.","I recently faced the \"System 2 Error\" many other users.  Luckily, I have a three year warranty and it was fully covered and came back within 3wks of mailing (I sent it just before Christmas so it took longer).<br /><br />The Pros:<br /><br />Excellent features<br /><br />Lightweight (I have small hands and cannot hold much weight)<br /><br />Came with a Remote control<br /><br />Large LCD<br /><br />etc...<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />Expensive (I paid $700 plus $135 3yr warrantly)<br /><br />Slow shutter speed<br /><br />Slow writing to flash<br /><br />Has a tendency to over/undercompensate EV (so you need to play with the function quite a bit)<br /><br />Dreaded LENS ERROR!!!!<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with my camera.  I never owned and SLR and this camera is a great stepping stone for someone like me who wants something like an SLR but can't afford/doesn't know how to use one.<br /><br />After owning the camera two years, I will definitely keep it as my, \"throw in the handbag and go\" camera but if you can afford an SLR, definitely buy one.","My Coolpix 8800 with the image stabilization and zoom is a real pleasure to use. I just wish somebody had pointed one thing out to me.  When I finally got my computer upgraded to handle large files, and tried some camera raw files, the Nikon PictureProject reported the raw (.nef) file was un supported.<br /><br />When I went to the Nikon web site which listed an update to process raw files, it asked for my camera serial number. It then rejected the number with a message that I might have a camera that wasn't a Nikon US camera, and cancelled the download.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this could be avoided, but recommend that any purchaser of a Nikon camera register it immediately while they can send it back for a refund if it doesn't meet Nikon US requirements. I still like the Nikon cameras and lenses, but I will point out this problem to anyone asking how I like my camera.","Again, I too will try not to duplicate the efforts of other reviews.<br /><br />I am not a pro, but I am a pretty advanced user, and this at least my 6th digital camera (I used to work in the industry so it was easy to get them; I didn't have a whole bunch break on me).  I bought it because I wanted a great camera for hobby shooting but didn't want to have to deal with separate lenses.  This is not a \"first-digital-camera\"; it's better suited for people who are pretty familiar with digital cameras and are looking for a camera that can be grown into.<br /><br />You can choose the \"point-and-shoot\" option or any of several manual options.  If you wish to employ the manual controls, the camera DOES take practice.  There are a lot of bells and whistles, as someone else mentioned, and I would highly recommend reading the instruction manual and experimenting with it before you take it on a big vacation (and bring the manual too).<br /><br />The image quality is fantastic, even when you are maxing out the zoom.  I take my pictures at 8MP and \"fine\" quality; anything larger is just overkill unless you're printing 20\"x30\" prints.  The Nikon has the in-camera option of creating a compressed copy of any picture you take (for e-mailing, etc.).<br /><br />I use the Macro feature a lot, and I took a picture of a caterpillar on a plant and even at a 4x6 print size, I could see the hair folicles on its feet.<br /><br />I also appreciate the Vibration Reduction feature (which you can turn off) and the flip-out LCD screen.  Before I purchased it, I looked at the Canon 6MP Digital Rebel (which felt too big in my hands) and the Sony 8MP (which, like most Sony items, is of good quality but pricey).  I ultimately decided on the Nikon because it felt comfortable in my hands, had a good reputation, and had high resolution and a flip-out screen.<br /><br />There is lag time, as there is with any digital camera.  I don't notice that it's any better or worse than other digital cameras I've used.  If you want no-lag, you need to look at the D-70 or another digital SLR.<br /><br />The battery life is really very good, as far as digital cameras go, and the battery doesn't add much weight to the camera.  If you are going on vacation or spend a while getting your pictures \"just right\" before you take them, buy an extra battery--you won't regret it.<br /><br />I started using the SanDisk Ultra II 1GB CF card and since have not run out of memory during an outting.<br /><br />If you decide you want to go with the 8800, here are some accessories you may want to consider:<br /><br />Spare battery (EN-EL7)<br />Lens Hood (HN-CP14)<br />Nikon Lens Pen (removes dust from body and lens)<br />1.0GB CF card<br />Lowepro Rezo 140 AW camera bag which holds EVERYTHING mentioned here with room to spare<br /><br />I have had my Nikon for over a year now, and I have not experienced any lens error problems (or otherwise) so far.  I'm sorry that people have had trouble with it because it's really an excellent camera and I haven't once regretted purchasing mine.  In a heartbeat, I would buy this camera again.","I won't repeat all the stuff in the other reviews.  Let me just say that I bought this camera to replace the D100, a fine Nikon DSLR.  I was tired of the \"lens fever\" that is never ending.  Also, the bulk and weight of all the equipment was tiring.<br /><br />The 8800 has some lag, just like all non-slr cameras.  But, I've learned to live with it. I just pace myself.  The continuous shooting modes give you ample opportunity to shoot action sports.<br /><br />The quality of the pictures is awesome.  The zoom lens gives me all that I had with my 5 pound lens.<br /><br />Speed isn't everything and maybe this camera isn't for everyone, but it's meeting my needs.  I'm not going back to my DSLR.","I bought this camera few months after it came out.  I like the features that it has.  The Remote, the stabilization, the zoom.<br /><br />Why, you ask I give this camera a 3 star?<br /><br />well, first of all, I took many pictures with normal light.  The results aren't as great as Nikon advertised.  During my first use, I had pictures that for some odd reason gave ppl black lips.  No, I know for sure that they weren't wearing any lipstick.<br /><br />I asked Nikon support for this anomaly, they still haven't gotten back to me.  I just updated the firmware today.  Hopefully this makes a difference in normal picture taking situations.  The lip color for some pictures is a mystery.  I haven't seen this problem much lately.  Maybe I don't take in door pictures as much.<br /><br />The Remote, it doesn't work well either.  It seems to work when it wants to work.<br /><br />I do like Nikon's softwares that accompanies this camera.","I've owned the 5700, then the 8700, and now the 8800. I've also owned a half-dozen high-level 35 mm film cameras over the years, beginning with the Nikon S2 in the 1950s ^|^. The 8800 is a fine upgrade and the 10X zoom and VR is FABULOUS! I do a lot of macro work, and tripods are not really always necessary these new days.<br /><br />Best of all is the image quality: vibrant, plenty of \"snap,\" and when recorded at 8Fine Jpeg, easily enlargeable/croppable to really big prints, with resolution to spare. AF works well, controls are more logically placed than its predecessors, still with far more bells and whistles than I'll ever use but they're not in the way. One TERRIFIC digicam. Complaints: ALL accessories are unique and available only at great price from Nikon. Bah!","I have owned this camera since March of '05, so I've had time to use it under a variety of conditions.  As of today, I have shot just under 4,000 shots with favorably mixed results.<br /><br />The best photos are great, with good color saturation, sharpness and overall quality.<br /><br />I shoot at low compression JPEG, \"Extra Image Quality,\" 8MB file-size, which translates to a usually selected ASA equivalent of 50.  Even with \"Vibration Reduction,\" I use support most of the time.  Normally, I either shoot in Program mode, varying exposure compensation and bracketing a lot or Aperture Mode to control depth of field, also bracketing.  After some experimentation, I found that most of the other bells and whistles are of limited use, at best.<br /><br />I almost never use the built-in flash unit, which, as with all built-in flash units, destroys image quality.  As an experiment, I also purchased an SB600, which works well mounted on camera, but drains the camera batteries after a few shots with the recommended remote cord.  I can compensate by triggering it on-camera, in Aperture Mode, set to way underexpose and using my SB-26 flashes as slaves at the correct exposure.  This leads to some major experimentation and some frustration.<br /><br />The L-Ion battery included with the camera is too weak for anything other than backup.  I had to purchase an MB-CP1 battery base so I could use easily replaceable NIMH batteries.  The base also adds balance and vertical shooting and zooming capabilities, similar to the units my Nikon film cameras use.  However, it is not very surdy by other MB standards.  Both jeweler's screws which held the tripod mount broke, and I had to super glue it back in the field.<br /><br />I have a website: (see my personal info) which is devoted to fine nature and wildlife photography and I always try to make my work the best possible.  This camera has been a useful, but a very flawed addition to my equipment.<br /><br />It was intended to replace a heavy field-pack at times, and it does, to some extent, under good conditions.<br /><br />My hope was that high-quality imagery in a purely digital mode would compensate for scratched film, high processing costs, and time consumptive scanning with film cameras.  This is the only catagory where I would give it five stars.  Productivity is really up.<br /><br />The camera has too many bogus \"program modes,\" a completely bogus built-in flash, semi-bogus LCD-viewing, although the multi-position screen has come in as a useful appendage at times.<br /><br />The autofocus is often frustrating.  The Normal, Distant and Near-focus switch, which is useful, is positioned in a really bad place where it often gets changed from pressure of the left hand, which can destroy photos without your realizing that it has changed. I lost a whole series of shots of a snowshoe hare in a snow storm because the LCD viewfinder wasn't detailed enough to show me the focus had shifted to near-only.<br /><br />If I carry my whole kit, including the camera, battery base, lens hood HN-CP14, SB600, extra batteries, compact flash cards and filters, my field pack is only 10 lbs or less heavier.  Of course, there is always a very sturdy tripod.<br /><br />Since I wrote this review I have begun to ready a large one artist show and in printing some 13X19\" pieces I have noticed some sharpness fall-off toward the edges and corners.  This is not acceptable.  I had planned to include a few 30X40\" prints, but I may have to use pieces shot with medium format film cameras instead of this ever-increasingly disappointing camera.<br /><br />In general, this is a camera which is capable of taking some awesome photos under the right conditions.  It has some really decent features, but many superfluous, unneeded, time-wasting and generally silly features.<br /><br />It will become the \"grab-camera\" that I keep in my trunk very soon.  I will be replacing it with a true DSLR that works with my normal lenses, although my field pack will get heavier again.","I've had the CoolPix 8800 for about 2 months. It is a remarkable alternative to more expensive digital SLR cameras. My first priority was to buy a camera that had RAW (Nikon NEF) file format capabilities. The 8800's 8-megapixel RAW images are 12 MB files. Even with a 50X CompactFlash memory card, individual files can take as long as 10 seconds to write/save. And while the file is saving, you can't adjust settings such as shutter speed or exposure. It can be a very frustrating wait.<br /><br /> I'll keep trying various high-speed cards, hoping I can get better results, and update this review if I find \"the perfect card.\" (NOTE: Write times are much faster using the multiple JPG or TIFF formats. But if you're not going to use RAW, there are less expensive alternative cameras to consider.)<br /><br />I would still buy this camera over anything else available when I purchased it. The 10X zoom with VR image stabilization is unbeatable!","I own both the 8800 and 8400. The cameras are identical except for the zoom and the image stabalization on the 8800. If you shoot mostly landscapes, get the 8400, the wide angle on it is the best around.<br />THIS IS NOT A POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA.<br />Don't expect to zoom to 10x and take a good picture in anything less than bright light. You will need some support, ideally a tripod. This isn't a problem with the camera, it is basic physics. No other camera is this category will do any better. The image stabalization helps, but will not fix everything. Make sure your expectations are reasonable and this camera will exceed those expectations. You will be unhappy if you think you can use this or any 8x, 10x+ camera handheld in any light or zoom length.<br />You'll get great images with either the Extra or Fine mode (jpg).<br />Stay away from the Hi (Tif format), there is no benefit and it takes forever to save. The resulting file is huge.<br />RAW is excellent, but slow to save. You can put it in burst mode and take several images while it is saving.<br />There is no CF card included with the camera. Get at least a 12x or better CF card. The Sandisk Ultra or equivelant work very well. You'll want a 512 or better if shooting at the largest images size and quality. A 512 will hold about 67 images at 2592 x 1944 in Extra, 45 at RAW and 124 at Fine. I'd recommend two 512 cards rather than one 1GB. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Use a card reader, don't plug the camera into the computer, it is an accident waiting to happen if you catch the cord on something.<br />That being said, you'll be amazed at the quality of the images this camera can take as well as the flexibility. You'd have to have a handful of lenses to achieve what this camera can do.<br />It is not pocket sized (unless you have large pockets).<br />You can buy Nikon filters or get an adapter and put any filter on it.<br />The batteries last forever on a charge, but get an extra one for a full day of shooting.<br />A lens hood is a useful accessory.<br />Both the 8400 and 8800 are IR capable with a Hoya R27 filter.<br />Check the Nikon Talk forum at (...) or the Nikon 8mp forum on Yahoo for more information on these cameras.","The best non DSLR camera I have seen. I have taken 1000's of pictures with this magnificient camera and everything has come out very nicely. A great outdoor/indoor camera. 10X optical zoom delivers razor sharp images with the highest detail even at the full zoom. VR works well to compensate camera movements. Produces life like images in any shooting condition. LCD and viewfinder are good too. Almost full manual control over everything. Menus are easy to follow and works well. In camera editing is a good tool to adjust contrast and sharpness. Eliminates red eye also. Smaller copies of pictures can be created within the camera and this is very useful if you are planning to e- mail your pictures because you dont need to resize the images once you have downloaded the images to your computer. Battery is powerful but better to have an extra one. Needs high speed CF cards like Sandisk Ultra II or Extreme 3. TIFF and RAW images are out of this world but takes up lot of writing time and space. Startup time is around 3 seconds but camera has power saving stand by mode which is very effective. This camera is made out of high quality materials meant to last. The look and the feel of this camera is awesome. Another great camera from Nikon for serious photographers.","This is a fabulous camera!  I love the point and shoot mode plus all the many, many other functions for when I want to use them.  The only problem is the lag-time from taking the picture to getting it on the memory card.  However, the good folks at Nikonusa tell me an 80X digital memory card will help this. Also there are adjustments on the camera that allow for fast shots.  I have only touched the surface of all these.","IF YOU ARE READY TO STEP UP TO A SEMI PRO TYPE CAMERA, AND YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH THE USUAL 3-5 MEGAPIXEL TYPE MICKEY MOUSE CAMERAS......AND YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY A TOP SHELF CAMERA THAT WILL LAST YOU A NUMBER OF YEARS..THIS IS THE CAMERA FOR YOU......<br /><br />THE PHOTOS THIS CAMERA TAKES ARE NOTHING SHORT OF BREATHTAKING<br /><br />THE 10X ZOOM AND THE NON SHAKE FEATURE , THE NIKON OPTICS, ARE THE FINEST ON THE MARKET, NIKON MAKES THERE OWN GLASS FOR ONE.......AND THATS SOMETHING THE OTHER WANT TO BE\"S DO NOT.........<br /><br />BUY THIS HIGH QUALITY CAMERA, READ THE MANUAL, AND THEN REREAD IT AGAIN.FIMULURISE YOURSELF WITH ALL THE FEATURES AND BENIFITS OF THIS FINE PIECE, AND BE PREPARED TO BE OVERWELMED","Hi there SinMin Here again! I'm going to assume you've just come over from the 8700 page, if you haven't you may want to check it out and compare my reviews on the 8700 & 8800. Okay. Now as I've said before when it comes to digital cameras the absolute love of my life has been the Sony F-828, I say has been because I now have a mistress called the 8800! So for the sake of argument I'm going to compare the 8800 to the 8700 and the 828. Lens: while quality goes to the Sony zoom and function go to the 8800 hands down, the 8700 has nice range but the 8800 is plain fantastic. VF mode: the process by wich the camera compensates for hand movement at slower shutter speeds resulting in great ambient light photography (I tend to hate flashes!) POW!! 828 and the 8700 blown right out of the water here!Not to mention the 8800 has retained all of the great Nikon scene modes (Including that Panorama thing), My beloved \"Bulb\" Function, Time lapse function(also available on the 8700), and the ability to correct your exposure after you take your shot right in the camera! Again ouch goes Sony! Controls: Sanity at last!! Nikon took the hint and gave the 8800 a familiar control interface which makes this camera 110% more user friendly than the 8700. ISO noise: Its no secret that high ISO numbers and digital cameras equal noise but I noticed a slight improvement with this on the 8800 over 8700, much more so than on the 828.And as I said before maybe it's me but the Nikon images seem to clean up better than my Sony shots tend to.Nikon also corrected my pet peeve about the 8700 by putting AF sensor OUTSIDE of the flash housing(thank You). Other pros: I(at least) noticed quite a bit of image improvement over the 8700 And I thought the 8700 shots were great, the 8800 was a bit better (Probably due to the VR feature) Another means the 8800 surpasses its little brother and the sony is the variation in image formats it can capture. Besides RAW and Tiff, the 8800 can capture 4 degrees of JPG files, (Basic, Normal, Fine and Extra which captures images at 1-2 compression) Get out yer gig card boys! Over all picture quality just barely goes to the 828 (that CCD is hard to beat)Dual memory capability, and overall design are all pro's in the 828's favor. But on virtually every other front the 8800 either matches or beats the Sony.And while the 8800 is a difinitive replacement for the 8700 they remain cameras with two different personalities (thats why I own and love both!)Other improvements over 8700: aside from the much needed improvements in design as well as zoom capability, it seems as though the 8800 shutter to apature function is a little tighter than the 8700, in other words my settings seemed to work better on the 8800. Now for the drawbacks, first off know one thing... this is a freaking HUGE!! camera!!! Only the 828 is longer and heavier (for me this is not a bad thing, but for some of you it will be) Speed as with the 8700, the 8800 just does not have speed (this is another area where the 828 wins out) either in start up or general picture function, this is strange considering the speed demon Nikon makes that goes by the name D-70! Noisy lens: I was told that the unusually loud noise the lens makes when you pull back focus or shut down the camera is normal by Nikon's customer service department, but I think it was excessive and should be something for correction on the next model (just a thought). These things aside, when you factor in all the goodies packed into this monster I can say this- \"I now have 2 right hand cameras.\" As I mentioned using the 8700 I shot a series of sunset photos using the \"sunset\" scene mode, I did the same with 8800 (same shoot in fact) and if you can believe it the shots were even better (I love that zoom with VR!) And as far as low light photography (long exposure) I have used few better.With my low light work even at a realatively high ISO, the shots were crisp and sharp.The biggest plus is that unlike the 8700 and in some ways the 828 the 8800 is easy to navigate and use most photographers will be able to get a great shot right out of the box, and that definitely will not happen with the 8700 or 828! Battery life: again this one goes to Sony, the first time I used my 8800 I killed the battery (doing long exposures) so I need to buy yet another AC adapter - the one for 8700 won't work! (what is it with Nikon and included accessories anyway?) Heres a pet peeve for you the 8700 & 8800 use completely different USB cables, AC Adapters (sold seperately), Batteries and chargers. as well as the most confusing array of exstension lenses and adapter tubes imaginable! Whats up with that? And yes I bought the lens hood for the 8800, and unlike the 8700 this one looks nice and normal (A flower hood to be exact) Conclusion: If your ready to step up (and I mean Up) to a pro quality camera, If you want to own and shoot with a piece of digital history this is your camera. For the novice looking to move on up, the 8800 is currently your only and best option, while I love the 828 as well as the 8700 they are fussy complicated cameras, the 8800 is not. even tho it is as powerful as the other 2 (more so in some cases)! This is the only camera I have found to date that I would reccomend as highly as the F-828. How should you decide? that depends on the type of photographer you are.(read my reviews and decide) The 8800 is by no means a toy, believe me it is very much a advanced photographic tool, just a little more user friendly. Bravo to Nikon! Sorry to Sony! I guess I just have to learn to shoot with two cameras...two very BIG cameras..WHEW! Well I hope this has helped, until next time Happy Shooting!","I own three 8 mp digicams--the Nikon 8800, the Minolta A2, and the Olympus 8080.  My Minolta sees use mainly in sports situations where its manual lens and fast focus are great assets, and I'm less concerned about sharpness.  The 8080, in good light, takes the sharpest and cleanest pictures.  The 8800, however, is the camera I carry with me most days, because of its versatility and the great images it is capable of producing.  For me, the 8800's greatest two \"flaws\" are slow speed and high noise in dim light.  It is relatively slow to focus, especially at long zoom lengths, if you do not pre-focus.  It is slow to record, especially if you shoot a series of images.  Noise becomes clearly present in low light images shot at ISO 200, and the noise at ISO 400 is, to me, intolerable.  Noise can be discernable at ISO 100 if the light isn't good.  The lens is slow at long zoom.  In good conditions, however, the 8800 takes beautiful pictures that can be blown up to 8-1/2 X 11 and larger with breathtaking detail.  I've been amazed at the clarity of pictures the camera will produce at maximum zoom.  In more challenging light situations, the camera generally does at least as well as the other digicams I've used.  Colors are usually accurate and vibrant, and the 8800 can capture up to five images in a quick series.  If I don't know what I will be shooting and want to cover a lot of possibilities, the 8800 is my carry choice.  It's compact and durable.  It offers huge zoom length, great resolution, and good macro capability.  It's easy to use, once you get familiar with it.  It's image stabilization works, allowing for many great shots without a tripod.  From the four months that I've used my 8800, there are dozens of shots that I've magnified to huge size on my laptop and just had to say, \"Wow, that's a great camera!\"  In the right conditions, this camera can really deliver.","An excellent camera... much better than the (very good) Nikon 995 which I previously owned primarily because of the VR.  The VR makes it ideal for both macro and telephoto hand held abailable light shots.  I recommend at least a one gig card and an extra battery.  With 10x optical plus 4x digital great distance shots are possible.  The camera is slow to focus in some cases, but I didnt find this a serious problem.","I own a D70 and bought the 8800 for my wife.  Initially she was very resistant to use the camera because it can be somewhat intimidating what with all that extra text in the viewfinder and the buttons and modes.<br /><br />With time, she warmed up to the camera and now loves it.  The VR stabilized zoom is a critical plus feature with the VR making a noticable difference.<br /><br />The camera takes great pictures in Auto in a variety of situations and it does a pretty amazing job of figuring out what the exposure should be for some pretty hairy conditions.  (Ironically this seems to be even better than my D70, but this is only an impression, not a calibrated fact).  We have not tried to use some of the more advanced features of this camera, but \"Movie Mode\" works well.  I don't know why 640X480 60FPS mode has a 60 second limit though.  (It must have something to do with write buffering, because when you finish a 60 second clip, the camera goes busy for QUITE some time.)  The bottom line is that you can get a lot of great pictures with this camera just leaving it on \"auto\".<br /><br />There are two caveats about this camera that cause me to only give this four stars.  The first is that the camera is slow, particularly to focus.  In fact, this slowness is the real reason it took so long for my wife to get used to it.  By the time you have framed the shot of the kids and the camera goes through the full range of focus, the moment is gone.  By comparison with my D70 in rapid fire mode, I have turned the camera on, zoomed to size and taken a half dozen shots.  (One of those 6 pictures \"worked\" vs. zero with the 8800.)  Once you learn to manage the \"half depression\" for the take button, you can somewhat compensate, but it is not intuitive operation.<br /><br />The second caveat is not so much of an issue as it is something to be aware of.  For some evil reason only known to the cruel marketing folks at Nikon, they made an incompatible (with the D70 that is...) battery pack for this camera.  There is no \"real\" reason Nikon cannot use a common battery pack across several camera models, they just do not.  This is important because this unit goes through a charge at BREATHTAKING speed.  It is entirely possible to be outdoors in a nature environment and need to change the battery over the course of a single day.  If you buy this camera, be *sure* to also buy an additional battery (maybe even two) and if you go on vacation, be sure to remember to bring the charger and charge the battery(ies) fresh each night.  (A simple international plug adapter works fine as this is a broad range international charger.) Contrast this with my D70 which only required a recharge once a week (*and* I took three times more pictures...).  Whereas I wasted my money buying an extra battery for the D70 (a simple charge each day works fine), for the 8800 this extra battery is essential and if you do not buy one or forget to bring it along, I *guarantee* that you will run out of power.<br /><br />Other than these two caveats, it is a great unit.<br /><br />****<br /><br />Well, a third caveat which would cause me to drop the number of stars to two but I cannot as amazon won't let me.  We too have been victims of the Coolpix 8800 \"lens error\".  We sent it in for warranty repair, and they fixed it but sent it back with the page of the manual highlighted about how you are supposed to keep the lens barrel clean.<br /><br />Gee whiz, thanks for the tip, Nikon.<br /><br />P.S. Nikon: the lens barrel *was* clean...<br /><br />We went on vacation after the warranty service and yet again got the maddening lens error.  I discovered, by an act of sheer frustration and desperation, that to work around this you need to mechanically disturb the lens.  One reviewer mentioned that they grabbed the lens.  This strikes me as being a bad idea and you are likely to break something.  What worked for me was to turn the power on, and while the lens was extending, immediately activate the telephoto followed by wide angle, and cycle it back and forth.  This seemed to \"clean\" the already clean lens barrel.<br /><br />Based on the number of comments about this and based on the fact that when we encountered the problem any reasonable person would have concluded that the lens barrel *was* clean, I have to conclude that Nikon's expectation is that this camera was designed to be operated in a \"class 1 clean room\".<br /><br />However in the real world where you carefully protect it from the elements, it might miss-behave.<br /><br />Buyer, beware.","I got this camera primarily for shooting outside and it's been exactly what I expected. I've owned 35 mm Nikons and two previous Coolpix. I love the foldable screen, image stabilization and long optical zoom. I recently took some photos inside our capitol rotunda in open shade. I was across the rotunda from the speaker [probably 40 - 50 yards or more] and on the 3rd floor, holding the camera against the balcony rail. I could still see the texture in cloth in the raw images.<br /><br />Camera is built like a tank. There's a lot of glass in the lens so one has to be aware of where the sun is -- but one should always do that anyway. Buy one, buy two!","By now you've read everyone else's reviews.  I agree with<br /><br />them except that I do have some issues that people might<br /><br />run into with this camera.<br /><br />1> My main problem with this<br /><br />camera is it's low light focusing - in low light conditions,<br /><br />I would swear that it does its focus sweep, seems to get<br /><br />the focus close, then picks something completely off.<br /><br />I have an old Coolpix 990 and it does a better, faster job of<br /><br />focusing in low light.  It \"smells like a firmware issue\" to<br /><br />me.<br /><br />2> There needs to be a way of disabling, in all modes, the<br /><br />focus assist light.  Nothing freaks out wildlife faster<br /><br />than beaming a bright orange LED in their eyes.<br /><br />3> There should be a focus mode that acts like \"continuous\"<br /><br />mode - but only when the shutter button is partially pressed.<br /><br />This could help with the overall focus speed issue.","I bought the 8800 as a second camera to use when I didn't want to cart the DSLR and it's bag of lenses around. After using it for about two weeks, it's been returned.<br /><br />On the surface, it seems to have a lot of features, but I'd have to characterize the 8800 as a \"fair-weather\" camera. In sufficient light (e.g. daylight) it takes great pictures.<br /><br />Let the light get dim, however, or use it at it's extended zoom range, or indoors, and it just hunts, trying to find focus. Not being able to use the extended zoom in anything but the best lighting conditions make having one a bit pointless. The EVF is coarse, making it difficult to judge subject focus, and the camera's high ISO range (400) isn't really usable.<br /><br />For those trying to make the purchase decision, be aware, the camera has some major drawbacks. You'll definitely need to determine if it fits your needs and shooting style.","I started out with a Nikon Coolpix 950 5 years ago, and we still have it! Last year I received the Nikon Coolpix 3100, and still own it as well (great little camera). I wanted something that had more capabilities, as I am becoming very involved in photography again. I did a lot of research between the 8800 and the Nikon D-70 SLR. In the end, I opted for the 8800, and thus far am very pleased with it.<br /><br />This camera is NOT for novice Digital Camera users. There are so many buttons, options, and gadgets that a novice would be very confused, even though it comes out of the box ready for just basic point-and-shoot photgraphy. However, this camera would be a high expense for someone who does not intend to use all it's bells and whistles. If you want a point-and-shoot only camera, without much to-do, go with the younger Nikon versions, such as the simple 3100 or a 5000 series. If you are looking for a more professional picture taking camera, and want to be able to add lenses, filters, hoods and flashes, then it's a sure bet. SHUTTER LAG TIME is very minimal here. It's still a tad slower than the D-70, but pretty fast for a digi camera. I have't had it long enough to know how it will hold up over the years, but thus far I'm very pleased with it. DOWNSIDE; requires those Lithium-Ion rechargable batteries that are pretty costly; you're supposed to take the battery out even when camera is \"off\", as it still draws a minute ammt. of battery power. Much heavier and bulky than a compact point and shoot (but a very different camera, also)<br /><br />A NOTE ON THE LEATHER CASE... this is a good choice for traveling, such as vacation and such. However, if you are a \"true\" photographer, you will need a large aluminum case to store all the lenses and accessories, plus the camera, in. The leather case barely holds the camera and a few major necessities, but does not really have room to carry the battery charger along, so you will need to purchase 1-2 spare batteries for a vacation trip.","the VR feature is good. i always want a camera with a telephoto lens that has VR that is affordable. It greatly reduces blurred shots for telephoto shots.<br /><br />when the camera writes the buffer memory to card even on single shot mode. the whole camera is useless. it simply locks up. very very irritating as it prevents the second shot till a couple of seconds later. Lesser cameras do not do that and it causes a lot missed shots. nikon needs to fix that . the buffer is big enough what wrong with the software or hardware in that part of the camera.","The 8800 is one of the best 8mp cameras out on the market today.  As a photographer, in my early days, I was after sharp pictures.  The 8800 delivers in this area and has one of the best zoom lens of any digital camera.  I've compared them all.  If you love macro photograph you will love the 8800 with VR.  VR technology allows and adjusts for camera shake.  It will not work miracles but it does work and will give you sharp pictures when other cameras will give you a blurred pic.  The 8800 is built like a tank with an all magnesium body.  The buttons and dials are all first class and have a high quality feel to them. The camera feels good in my hands and is very ergonomic.  One of the greatest joys of this camera is that it is an easy to learn and use.  The camera has many features that are easy to get to without toggling through an lcd screen. The 8800 uses a dial on the top of the camera where the \"most used\" features are quickly available.  The 8800 has many positives.  Fast AF in normal lightning, incredible sharp pictures, a macro lens to die for (snapped a few sharp macro shots without a tripod that were razor sharp), a bright LCD screen that swivels any way you want, a great viewfinder that is accurate, infinity mode, several shooting modes (aperture priority, shutter priority, true manual, programmed mode), and excellent battery life all in a compact package.  Some of the negatives:  Dim lightening situations are not the Nikon's friend.  I'm taking about a dimly lit room or no light at all. I simply turn on a light and I'm ready to go.  If you do lots of birthday parties and are trying to capture the action in total darkness this camera is not for you.  Although, there are work arounds.  Focus with the lights on and then take your shots with the lights off.  Another negative are the write times. The camera has minimal lag.  When you press the button the camera takes the pic without any noticeable lag.  However, in the highest JPG mode the camera takes a few seconds to write to the CF card.  Unless you're doing action photography this shouldn't be a problem.  And the 8800 has burst modes that allow you to take multiple shots blazing fast when you press the shutter.  You will not be able to refocus or compost the pic.  The viewfinders go black too.  I don't see myself using these modes.  There has also been concern about manual focus on this camera.  It is useless but so is the manual focus on every other digital camera I tried including the FZ20.  Honestly the camera can do a better job then your eye anyway, IMHO.  If you want manual focus you'll have to pony up for a DSLR which has interchangeable lenses:  You'll pay a lot more for a Nikon lenses with VR then you will for the 8800.  All in all the Nikon is a great camera and I'm glad I bought the camera and I would buy it again.","I have owned every coolpix from the 900 to this one. Every time they come out with a new model, I sell the old, and buy the new. There are always some new feature I'd like to have, items on my wish list that have been answered. (Some of my best shots were taken with the 900 1MP model.) I certainly miss the smaller twist models (last:4500).<br /><br />The good: I'm comparing mostly with the more recent coolpix models, not similar cameras from other manufacturers. I could go into why I've stuck with Nikon, but that's another story. Nikon has wisely taken their most often used controls away from an inconvient buried menu and put in on a dial right net to the shutter release. The have threaded the front lens mount for easier use of lens add-ons. (the 5700 and 8700 require slide on adaptors). the Vibration Reduction was a big upgrading feature for me. Past owned coolpixes: you're taking a shot of people outdoors in shade. The coolpix wants to use the flash. You disable the flash and find that your resultant shots are blurry. Agggrhhh!!! The VR helps in this respect. I've pushed the use of this feature, and its certainly not a miracle worker, but an improvement. The 10X zoom lens is a real winner- keeps away the temptation to use an add-on tele conversion lens. The short movie feature is better in quality than past cameras and very handy. There is a new battery model- needed for the more power hungry 8800. If your coming from a smaller MP camera, the 8MP's value is in allowing you to crop in software and still get a sharp print. Also for making very large enlargments. For regular snapshots and email/web photos it is gross overkill. There is a remote control which is nice for taking slow shutter speed shots and the times when the photographer wants to get in the picture without having to run like the devil before the self timer releases. For those not familiar with the coolpix line, the build is excellent, the camera is comfortable, the close ups breathtaking, the photos are very sharp, the features are numerous. The monitor swivel is very handy- i'd say indespensible. This is a choice if you want the top without getting into interchangable lenses and the expense and inconvenience of same.<br /><br />The bad: The 8800 is a tad larger than the 8700, but just enough to make it feel bulky. The 8700 felt perfect. The shutter delay is still annoying. The low light functionality is still inferior. The manual mode is still relatively useless. (It would be great to be able to focus and zoom the lens by turning the lens barrel like you could in prehistoric times. The monitor is a tad small for a camera of this size. And the auto exposure has a tendancy for too much, forcing you to manually under compensate (easy to do, but annoying to have to do) in many lighting conditions.<br /><br />Necessary add-ons: Nikon makes a great $25(?) leather case. An additional battery (the after market ones for other Coolpix cameras were good enough, but not available yet for the 8800). A filter lens cover (so you are cleaning that and not the lens). And a Birt Sirkin CheatSheet. And you might consider buying (eventually) one of those real small (e.g. Casio) cameras as a pocket model when your photo needs are light.<br /><br />General complaint about digital cameras: Low light sensitivity. What's this 'noise' BS. This is (almost) 2005. We should be shooting at ISO 1200 with no noise.","I was wondering if the upgrade from my Olympus C-2100Z 2.1mp to this 8mp camera was worth while because my old camera also had an X10 stabilized lens.  The answer is YES it was.  The extra mp makes a very big difference and the overall improvements over the past three years have been dramatic.  Rather than giving an amateur's review of this camera let me steer you to professional reviewer sites.  The nice thing about these sites is that if you decide this camera is not for you then they have reviews on cameras that you just might like.<br />[...]<br /><br />I didn't find the supplied software exceptional but it does give you a place to collect your photos.  Also these days I do not usually print my photos.  I save them to CD's or DVD's and play them back on the TV set, I find this a much nicer way to keep photos and then to view them.<br /><br />The camera does have some shortcomings but I think overall it is excellent.  If you take photos in near dark then it will not focus.  I take photos inside and outside where there is usually existing light so this is no problem for me.<br /><br />Not a shortcoming is the little remote control that I just love.  You set the camera on a tripod, get it set up for taking a picture, hit the timer, go get yourself in the picture then push the remote control and you have your picture, NICE!  Then it's very convenient not having to carry a tripod for the telephoto shots, the Vibration Reduction feature sees to that.<br /><br />Years ago going on vacation meant a big bag of lenses, bodies, etc but with the 8800 that's no longer necessary.  [...]<br />Art Rideout","I bought this splendid camera when it was released last november in Hong Kong. Previously I had a Canon A 80, but there is no way to compare both. This Nikon is the pinacle of easy to use digital camera, but offers features only availlable to professional cameras. Starting buy the brand, the best camera maker, going tru the 10x zoom and VR steady system,'you will have a powerfull camera with a bat pack that stands decently (even tough I bought a second battery pack EN-EL7). The pictures quality is gorgeous. I hope it last enought to worth is price, HK$7280.00= some US$936.00. But it's much much cheaper the bauying in Brazil, where I live and I'm from (R$8000,00)= some US$2,900.00.<br /><br />I do recommend this camera if you can afford it.","The Nikon Coolpix 8800 is an excellent upgrade from the 8700.  The image resolution, vibration reduction, zoom range, lens quality and build quality alone make this camera worth five stars. Sure, it is not perfect, but no camera is. People who whine that this camera doesn't have good manual focusing, should be aware that no prosumer cameras have good manual focusing.  I know because I have tried nearly all of them at Camera World in Portland, Oregon, when deciding to buy the 8800.<br /><br />I own a Canon DSLR for my bread and butter camera, but could not find a better backpacking/mountain biking camera than the 8800.  It is light, strong and I can make gorgeous reproductions up to 16x20, even larger with some careful interpolation.<br /><br />This is the prosumer camera to beat, an excellent second camera, with much better battery life than previous Nikon Coolpix.","I own a Canon \"Elf\" camera that uses APS film. It takes very nice pictures, but I wanted to upgrade to a camera that would have better zoom capabilities and would make it easier to exchange pictures with family. After looking at a bunch of digital cameras, I chose this one as the best trade-off of zoom, ease of use, picture quality, other features, and price.<br /><br />The point-and-shoot mode takes really terrific pictures if the lighting conditions are perfect. However, I find that if the lighting conditions are even a bit less than optimal, I get much nicer pictures with my APS-film camera (although it only has a 3x zoom). Shots with the Nikon are very often out of focus or too dark. You can go to manual control, and there are also about 20 pre-set picture modes (portrait, night-time, etc). But (1) you need to invest a lot of time to really master all of these controls, and (2) you need considerable expertise to use them \"on the fly\" to take great pictures. Adequate pictures, sure; but I find that for most regular use, my film camera takes better pictures, on average. If you are thinking of buying this, consider carefully your skill level with a camera. If you are a point-and-shoot person, this is probably not the best choice. If you are already very good with manually controlling digital cameras, you will be able to coax some fantastic pictures out of this thing.<br /><br />Also, beware; if you have a rebate, it will take many, many months for it to be processed. We finally called them and got kind of a snotty \"well, we're just too busy and you'll just have to wait\" response from the person we talked to.","I have owned the Nikon 8800 for two months now and I do love this camera--sharp photos, accurate color, and good ergonomics. Very well-built.  This is a very feature-rich camera and I am still trying various features.  Mostly I have been taking photos (about 1800 already) in both Program mode and Aperture Priority mode and getting to know the camera.<br /><br />I don't really have much problem with the auto focusing. I owned the 5700 before this and several other Nikon digitals.  While the Nikon uses a contrast-based focusing system, this particular camera has a very effective focus assist light that allows good low light focusing, even in a completely dark room.  Focusing in general is very quick, though the camera hunts just a little at full tele. Shutter lag is minimal but this camera is a little slow in writing to card.  The use of Quick Response, though, allows you to take immediate shots if you do not need to refocus (though you can recompose) and there are a variety of continuous modes so this is a minimal problem for me in the type of photography I do, even when taking photos of my husband riding his bicycle (Panning with him in focus and background blurred).  I take most of my indoor photos near wide angle and I choose to turn off the 9-point area focus system. If this is on, the camera has a smaller area to try to focus in.  I tend to use an exposure of a minus 1/3 outdoors and a plus 1/3 indoors.<br /><br />Outdoors the 10X stabilized lens is fun and the VR stabilization technology works very well.<br /><br />Photo quality is very high and there is very low noise at ISO 50.  I do not usually need to use an antinoise program on my photos unless I use the higher ISOs.<br /><br />TTL focusing is possible with the SB600 or SB800 external flashes.  You can use all the features except the focus assist of these flashes, but you already have a good focus assist light on the camera.<br /><br />Negatives?  I find the placement of the function button awkward, but all the other buttons and dials are very well placed.  Also, Nikon is slow in getting accessories available for us.  While the Nikon filters are an odd size, most of us have chosen to use a filter adaptor from nextphoto.com which allows the use of generic filters.  I find the zooming mechanism a little jerky.  And there is a little barrel distortion at wide angle, not a problem in my photos.  CA including PF have really not been a problem for me.<br /><br />I rate this camera very highly!","I've had the Nikon 8800 for a few weeks and I thought I'd post some comments on the camera. Years ago I worked as a still photographer (large format) and have had many years of experience with film cameras. My previous digital cameras were: Olympus 360, Canon G2, Minolta Z1, Sony U30. The Nikon 8800 represents my first serious jump into a more capable digital camera.<br /><br />I give the camera a thumbs up, but Nikon made some mistakes that might give pause to some shooters.<br /><br />1) The autofocus system is good, but falls short of other cameras I've used. It is easily fooled with less than ideal situations. Even choosing AF area can leave you with soft shots from time to time. Overall you can achieve a high success rate, but my tiny Pentax Optio S5I has a superior AF system WITHOUT the AF assist light. In side by side tests, the Minolta Z1 and Pentax could both grab focus (in CERTAIN situations) when the 8800 couldn't. This is not to say that the AF system on the 8800 is poor. It's just not as good as it should be for a camera on this level. I've already read of other complaints regarding low-light focus issues in other forums and you'll see plenty more if you search around.<br /><br />2) Luckily, Nikon knew this would be a camera for the more serious shooter and added a manual focus. Amazingly it is all but totally useless. A unmarked bar indicates focus position and it's quite vague. With it's electronic finder, you have many soft shots using the manual focus. The Nikon manual mentions sharp outlines when in focus, but like other users I can't see this. Not adding a distance scale is a crime and a actual focus ring would have made this camera a killer! To make matters more insulting Nikon didn't even add a focus area enlargement in EVF found on sub 300 dollar cameras. My Optio S5I has a usable manual focus, but the 8800 doesn't???<br /><br />3) The SB600 and 800 flash will work with the 8800!!! Yay! I knew that the flash units had a better AF assist light that would aid the focus situation and, of course, make for better indoor shots. WRONG. The AF assist feature set on the 600/800 WON'T WORK with the 8800. This was confirmed by Nikon tech support. So I must pay full price for 75% of a flash?<br /><br />4) Nikon chose to at least delay your chances of buying aftermarket lens add ons with it's unique filter thread. Bzzzzzz! Nikon wasn't too bright and brought accessories to market late. Go to the Nextphoto sight and save money and expand your choices.<br /><br />5) A two inch LCD would have been nice, though the 1.8 is \"enough.\"<br /><br />6) The 8800 optics will NOT match the D70 for ultimate sharpness and detail. No way, no how. It's the price you pay for the long zoom. But we all knew that!<br /><br />7) I really wanted the battery grip...but 169.00 for a plastic shell??? It feels cheap, especially the buttons. Shockingly so. Even the guy at B&H Photo laughed at it! Buy the flash instead as that will actually expand the camera's capability.<br /><br /> The AF Assist light on the 8800 is not in the best place and can be easily obscured by a finger.<br /><br />9) This is no lightweight camera of course. I bought the tiny Optio S5I for those times when I might not want to lug the 8800 around. My friend with an 8800 felt the same way and bought the slightly larger Sony L1. (Off Topic, The L1 and Optio are fine little snapshot cameras!)<br /><br />NOW, reading all of this you might think that I hate the 8800. Not so. It's a great camera and I have taken shots of my new baby with it that are jaw dropping. I suppose that the flaws are more glaring in light of how much of the camera is done right. It is a ultra capable prosumer unit with excellent feel and tremendous ability. This is a great camera to own while waiting for the DSLR field to improve and become more affordable.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful to some of you. I'd like to hear other detailed user comments, especially regarding low light focus issues.<br /><br />Happy shooting!<br /><br />Capt RB","I purchased this camera after several weeks of researching the varioius 8MP cameras on the market today.  I've had it for about two weeks now and this is what I can tell you:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Great zoom! 10x zoom is great for getting close to your subject.<br />2. Macro works really well.<br />3. VR (Vibration Reduction) works extremely well.  I have done several hand-held shots down to 1/4 second shutter speed that have no noticeable camera shake. Very cool!<br />4. Good autofocus speed. Even in low light w/ AF assist lamp, providing you're at the widest angle (35mm). See con 1 below. Good autofocus speed even at 350mm providing there is ample light (daylight).<br />5. Feature rich camera that produces exceptional images.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Poor autofocus in low light, even w/ AF assist, while using zoom.  When taking pictures when using any zoom in our family room the camera will OFTEN miss focus or not focus at all, even when the AF assist lamp is activated.<br />2. SLOW 2.8-5.2 lens. This lens really hampers focus ability in low light.  I found that the zoom really only works outdoors w/ ample light. I did not think the slow lens would be a real issue, but I am surprised at how often it gets in the way.<br />3. Manual focus.  If you need this feature, keep looking.  The manner in which Nikon implemented autofocus on this camera is useless (really, it is).  This is a real problem only if AF cannot get a lock (see #1).<br />4. Nikon specific filters and lens attachments.  Nikon chose to make the filter ring on this camera a non-standard 53mm thread.  If you plan to use filters, you will be purchasing the Nikon filters made specifically for this camera.  If you have an assortment of filters you would like to use w/ the 8800, there is an adapter ring (not Nikon) available, but some results have vignetting.<br />4. Noise at high ISOs.  Similarly to other 8MP cameras this one too suffers from a lot of noise at ISO higher than 100.<br />5. Does not include lens hood. Most other cameras in this lineup include the lenshood.  Not a major issue, just another 35.00 expense if you actually need it.<br /><br />A word about CA/PF.. Like all other 2/3\" CCD 8MP cameras this one is not immune to PF.  At this time I have not noticed a _serious_ amount of CA/PF in high contrast areas.  I can tell you that it does indeed exist. I have seen it as green, red, blue and purple fringing. So far it has not been a huge drawback and I don't consider it a major issue.<br /><br />Overall I am impressed with this camera and its many features (including advanced features).  I can't say enough about the zoom and VR capabilities, these two features set this camera apart from many of the others.  I can live with the deficiencies as the quality of the images and build of the camera more than make up for where the camera fails.<br /><br />-R","I consider myself a typical prosumer photographer (if such a thing exists) -- I have had several digital cameras over the past 3 or 4 years from 1MP, 2MP 3.2MP, 5.1MP and now this 8MP wonder. It produces quality shots with a \"virtual\" SLR viewfinder; unless your stubbornly dogmatic about needing a \"real\" dSLR, this camera is equal to, if not better than, most dSLRs that cost 2-3 times as much. The only place where a dSLR might prove more advantageous would be for the photographer who is looking to take alot of VERY FAST moving action, such as war correspondents and sports journalists. Considering the vast majority of professional photographers do everything else - from wedding/portrait photography, macro photography, wildlife, etc. - this camera equals and exceeds its pricier kin manyfold. I would also remind everyone that the megapixel value is higher on this than on most dSLRs, and the noise is almost non-existent except in severely bad (I mean SEVERELY bad) lighting conditions. Tip: use lumatix and autobracketing, coupled with Photo Ninja on your pics and you will rarely ever have a bad photo (technically, not compositionally) as it pertains to exposure and grain/luminance noise. Final verdict: this one beats out all the other 8MP models and fulfils 90%+ of the professional photographer's needs as well or better than the pricier (and lower MP) 4-6MP dSLR's do (except for very-fast-moving photo work, which is only an issue if your a photojournalist in all likelyhood.)","Our first digital camera...& what a great choice we made.  This megapixel technology is phenomenal...enlargements are so clear..I can't underscore the quality enough.  I am certainly not a technical/electronic person...& prefer simpler gadgets to those that are over infused with a gazillion bells & whistles..but this I can use. It's not fussy & annoying to work with.  I thought it would be heavy..but it's not...it sits very comfortably in my hand.  On the other hand...this camera has it's faults!<br />When taking pictures in dim or lighting darker than daylight...this camera really struggles ...& is quite sluggish.  The built in flash takes so long to go off...the camera takes so long to focus...that by the time the camera is ready...quite frankly you've lost the shot.  Also the camera is slow in getting from one shot to another...the delay in between is exasperating!  Overall I don't recommend this camera unless you plan to primarily shoot in daylight which it works great in....or you plan to purchase an additional flash for evening shots...which is what I'm going to have to do."]},{"name":"Nikon D2X","amazon_reviews":["Fast Camera although it did have some ware and tare but I can always take it to Shinjuku to have the rubber parts replaced.

I did download the manual on line and brought it up for reference just in case.<br />It feels familiar, so no culture shock, the controls are where my fingers think they should be without having to look for them.<br />Weight to me is a plus; I found I have more stability hand held with a longer lens if the camera is heavier.<br />It balances well with the big super zooms like the Sigma 170-500.<br />With Nikon's firmware version 2, Hi-2 on the iso setting allows up to 3200 plenty fast enough for my needs.<br />Cons:  Uses a more expensive compact flash card instead of an HDSC card.<br />DX format so I have go to a shorter lens to get the same coverage as a 35mm on the F4, but a 300mm now has a 400mm + magnification so it's a trade off.<br />When using older non-CPU lenses you need to set the minimum focal length and max aperture in the menu before they will be able to auto focus.<br />Weight to some would be a con but take a hint from bass players get a wide comfortable strap, and sling it like a bandoleer, it lessens the strain on the neck, keeps the camera out of the way but close enough for easy access<br />Overall I'm happy with my decision.<br />I feel if I can't get a decent photo with 12mp, 16mp or more isn't going to help.<br />The body I purchased from Adorama was rated E- meaning Moderate wear, maybe scratches.<br />Yup they are there, about 3 or 4 wear spots that you have to look very close to find.<br />It came packed well enough to survive a lunar landing.<br /><br />Update 3 July 2013<br /><br />Brief update.<br />The more I use it the better I like it, after around 200 shots I'm beginning to get the hang of it and its idiosyncrasies.<br />I found one older 28-70mm f2.8 lens that is always super sharp on my F4, has soft focus in AF mode on the D2x, it is sharp in manual though. This is the only lens I have that has this trouble so may be an anomaly in my particular lens.<br />Not a big deal because I purchased a new 17-70MM f2.8 which is quieter, focuses faster and is sharp at all focal lengths. So problem solved.<br />Note: I have yet to find a zoom in any focal length as sharp as a dedicated single focal length lens.<br />With longer lenses I found AF mode to be very important. Either single area or group dynamic works best to eliminate \"hunt\" in low light or for subjects in \"busy\" areas such as birds in leafy trees.<br />In dynamic area with things like slightly moving leaves it will try to correct focus on everything, not a good combination.","I had three D1X before D2X... battery life of the D1Xs was terrible, although I loved the results coming out of them, I couldn't trust for my sessions trusting the batteries... which. I also purchased brand new.<br /><br />My purchase from Amazon was as always, very easy and quick. Camera I received was much better than I ever thought for the price... very well maintained, and only 25K original shutter count. For this camera, which is around 300K shutter life expected, 25K is basically brand new.<br /><br />There are no bad things about the camera, a pro full body, large megapixs enough to print posters... very clean and sharp images... easy to use menu system... and extremely long battery life vs D1X's batteries.<br /><br />I think I will be buying same camera as my backup soon.","Needed a backup SLR and I had some old Nikkor lenses, so I decided to try out this refurb D2X.  It seemed like a good deal for a one-time flagship.  I was surprised to see what good condition it was in for a camera this old.  Everything works like new as far as I'm concerned.  I just wish it full-frame.  But I don't want to spend that kind of money yet.  Overall, very happy with this purchase.","This camera is GREAT! I had a Nikon d2h and the d2x out perform its predecessor with amazing results! The photos are clear and clean and it is very user-friendly. If you are looking for a true professional DSLR with 12.4 mega-pixels but you don't want to spend a arm or a leg, this is the camera for you! Eventually I will upgrade to a d3x or d4 but for the time being my d2x is good enough for me! Remember, this camera when it first came out(2005) it cost $5000 but now it is affordable! Only things I can say is get it, trust me you won't regret it!!","The D2x is a very fast and flexible camera and well worth the price I paid for it used.  I like the quality of the pictures I get with it and the fact that it extends the focal length of my lenses so that I can put off putchasing longer lenses for a while. One thing I read while researching the D2x was the noise at ISO higher than 800 and it is true. I try not to push my camera beyond ISO 640-800 as I find that the shadow noise is unacceptable, even with noiseware software. I have a D700 for high ISO shots. Overall I am very impressed with the picture quality and build quality of the D2x.","Since the D2x was introduced I've dreamed of owning this camera and after waiting seven long years I was finally able to afford a refurbished model from Nikon and it does not disappoint!<br /><br />I've read reviews and opinions and none of them give this camera enough credit. My opinions are, this camera fits perfectly in my hand, it is solid and with a super zoom lens its heavy but I love it!<br /><br />The learning curve was not hard in fact within just a few hours I was enjoying the features and making some awesome photographs.<br /><br />I know it sounds cheesy but I am super impressed. If you know Nikon cameras and have knowledge of the basics of photography on an intermediate or higher level this camera will produce for you.<br /><br />I read so many reviews putting this camera down for the learning curve but I didn't have any difficulties learning and utilizing the features on the D2X within just a few short hours.<br /><br />I would say if you have done your homework and know the basics of photography and love Nikon then you will not go wrong on the D2X!","This camera arrived quickly and in great shape.  It was very difficult to tell that it was used at all.  It is a camera I could never have afforded at full price.","The Nikon D2X might be considered \"old\" technology by current (2012) digital camera standards, but it's still as capable today of capturing great images as it was when it was new back in 2005. The single biggest complaint against this old workhorse is that it lacks the clean high ISO performance of current generation DSLRs.<br /><br />That being said, if you don't regularly need ISO 1600 or higher then the D2X is an AMAZING tool. For starters, the magnesium alloy body is built like a tank and can survive abuse that would destroy a typical consumer-grade camera like the Nikon D3100 or D3200. Unlike the budget DSLRs in Nikon's product line, the D2X isn't artificially \"crippled\" by the lack of important features like high speed sync with Nikon speedlights. The D2X can shoot at 5 frames per second (fps) in normal 12 megapixel DX (1.5X crop) shooting mode or it can use a 2X crop mode (roughly 7 megapixels) to increase the burst mode to 8fps.<br /><br />There are also a ton of other customization options with this camera as well as the wonderful ability to record audio files with any image; this is great if you're a photojournalist and need to make a note about who or what you just photographed. Just take the photo and then press the microphone button on the back of the camera and you can record a note like \"This is a photo if John Doe and Jane Doe outside the courthouse.\" The audio file is tagged with the name of the image so you can identify which audio clip goes with which image.<br /><br />Overall, if you're wanting a \"professional grade\" DX-format (1.5X crop) DSLR then Nikon D2X is every bit as good as the D300 or D300S cameras ... at a lower price on the used market.","Adorama(via Amazon)exported this item to Australia in a very nicely prepared package with an MH-22 charger and a brand new wide strap.<br />The camera is in excellent condition with only 18k shutter actuations.<br />I didn't buy this product as my only DSLR but more as a collectors piece, OK as modern DSLR's go it's fairly \"old hat\" but it has fine build quality and still captures excellent images.<br />Probably the price, a fraction of it's original cost when new....prompted me to purchase. I immediately upgraded the firmware to the latest version and put in an EN-EL4A battery from another camera and off it went. I don't think it will take long to up the shutter count a bit!<br />Great buy, good service from Adorama and Amazon and a fine ex flagship product...well chuffed!!","I am a professional photographer. I have been in the industry since 1996 and have gleefully watched the transition from film to digital and been able to play with many cameras along the way. 3 years ago the studios I was managing began using these cameras.<br /><br />Previous, in studio and in personal use I was a die-hard Cannon girl. After using this camera and the D300 (yes, this one is BETTER than the D300; and dozens of other professionals I know say the same), I have converted to being a Nikon girl!!<br /><br />I personally use this camera for up to 100 clients per week. If we had more need for higher mega pixels that would be my biggest complaint (I wish it was 15++). My only other concern is that when dropped (even from a very short height) or was knocked over (which, after 3 years, has happened a couple times) the lens doesn't seem to hold up as well as my Cannon lenses do. That being said, the body itself has been perfect.<br /><br />Overall, I love it. It's responsive, easy to use, and produces good results. We regularly print 20x30s for our clients and they think the quality is great too!","This was Nikon's high res camera, and in actual use it really did just put the Canon 1Ds Mkii to shame.  Much better files at any ISO.  Much more color accurate.  More dynamic range, especially at base iso.  And, because of the crop sensor, it was always sharper into the corners.  Especially with wide angles (I always felt that canon's wide, superwide, and ultrawides were soft in the corners to start with--the high res 1Ds series just exposed the flaw).<br /><br />I doesn't hold it's own against today's offerings in terms of image quality (especially at high ISOs), but it is very capable of producing great images.  (Or at least as capable as the person wielding it).  I used it at 3200 and my work flow was just adapted for it.<br /><br />I sold my battle scarred beasty to a student and I now shoot a d700.  ....but a part of me misses that camera.<br /><br />I would definitely take this over anything under a d90 today.  And I'd take this over a d90 if I were going to be shooting in inclement weather or dusty environments.<br /><br />Unlike the d1/d1x/d2h, this camera will still be in use years from now.  It's just that durable and that good.  Even the batteries are durable (Canon had only begun using lithium ion batteries in their pro cameras three years after this camera was released--the 1Ds mkii uses NIMH batts that you can't even buy new anymore).<br /><br />Nikon did everything right when they made this one.  Definitely a robust beast.","The camera was sold as written: Like New condition: very clean, clear, xlnt quality, well packaged, sent and received. Good price for this camera. I'm professional photographer, i steel use DX format Nikon's brend for my work: wedding photography, studio, people, nature, travel.","I got the D2X last August, knowing full well that a replacement for the D100 (which turned out to be the Nikon D200) was eminent.  I had a job to do in October that paid for the cost of the D2X twice over, and I'm still glad I got this camera when I did.  I now have a D200 as a backup, and am surprised at how many ways it equals the D2X, but if you want one of the two absolute best digital cameras on the market, this is one of them.  (The Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II is the other.)<br /><br />The D2X and 1DS-II have virtually the same image quality (although Canon gets the edge in terms of high-ISO noise), but the D2X is the only choice for those who have a large investment in excellent Nikon lenses.  I personally have no need for a full frame camera, so Nikon's 1.5X sensor crop factor doesn't bother me.<br /><br />The D2X is rugged, versatile, and amazingly fast in operation.  I've used it to shoot football games in light drizzles, lugged it through Europe, and worked with it for critical macro photography.<br /><br />Now that the price of the original D2X has been reduced significantly, and the new D2Xs is more affordable, too, this camera is even more of a bargain compared to its chief rival.  Nikon is providing many of the enhancements of the new model as a BIOS download, so I expect my D2X will remain my favorite camera for at least several more years.  About the only thing it doesn't do well is infrared.","After seeing some examples of photos from this gem of camera paired with a substantial [...] and getting a good price on selling my D100, did I finally make the plunge to a professional level digital camera. I am a serious amateur and I have owned this camera for about three months and shot off nearly 2000 photos under a variety of conditions. The camera is used with an ED glass zoom Nikkor lens G 28-200 mm and a Nikon SB600 flash. And I could not be happier with my new toy, um . . . tool. The image quality is superb with its 12 MP CMOS sensor. The build of the camera is a very durable magnesium body with well placed and well made controls. You can change ISO, image size, autofocus settings, shift from autofocus to manual and a number of other setting right from the camera body. Potentially if I became familiar enough with these controls I could make the changes without ever taking my eye from the camera. Furthermore, the camera is environmentally sealed and meant to be used under a variety of demanding conditions though I do not recommend taking it or any other electronic device into the rain without adequate protection. The grip both horizontal and vertical felt secure in my hands. There is a vertical shutter button with dials on the body to alter shutter and aperture settings. There are locks to prevent inadvertant firing of the vertical shutter button and shifting of the auto sensor for focus and metering. Below the depth of field preview button there is an additional button to which you can aside a variety of functions. I have it set to spot metering. The camera body unlike other Nikons does not come with a pop up flash though it does have a hotshoe. There is an additional sensor for white balance over the pentaprism. For those taking sports the camera has a high speed crop mode which shoots off much faster pictures but at a reduced resolution of 8 MP. There are three selections of metering: spot, center and the new 3D Color Matrix Metering II all of which may be changed from the right side of the pentaprism. I've found the Matrix Metering to be strikingly accurate with just a few times where the metering is fooled but this has been primarily where there have been extremes in lighting such as a night scene with a bright street light in the view. The auto white balance though not perfect has certainly been an improvement over that of the D100. You can also select your own white balance either from a grey card, a white card or even from ambient light. I have primarily use the autowhite balance. When I've had to use autofocus mainly for my cute rocket powered niece, it has been quite fast and accurate. The camera uses an electric cable release. You need to remove a small screw top from the front portion of the camera on side opposite of the shutter. At the time of this review the Nikon brand release MC-30 are not in stock anywhere though I've seen the fancier MC-36 available several places. A third party release such as one from Adorama is less expensive and seems to do the job. The camera performs very well at most of its ISO settings. The lowest is 100 and the highest which is the equivalent of 3200 called \"HI-2.\" The noise up to HI-1 (1600) is actually not bad since it is more like film grain than true digital noise which is neither entirely random nor nearly as pleasing. For those adverse to noise, the camera has an excellent noise reduction system which eliminates nearly all noise up to about 400 to 800 ISO. I have not noted any banding my JPEG images. There are actually a ton of other features which I am not going to detail here. There are a few downsides to this camera. It is quite heavy and large. I'd recommend that you go to your local camera store and hold the camera. Those with neck and back problems may find it too heavy and those with small to medium small sized hands may find it difficult to operate. Also due to its size you are going to attract attention so you'll need to be more vigilent. Because of the high resolution of the camera you need to have excellent technique mainly in holding the camera. The Matrix Metering is so usually right on that you will notice more of your photos will be far better exposed. Though \"correct\" exposure is a matter of artistic intent. You also need excellent glass on the camera. If know you will be using the cable release I would remove the small screw top from the camera body and leave it at home. It is screaming to get lost. Lastly, this camera is expensive and is not for the casual photographer as you will be paying for many features which you will never use. For a comprehensive listing for features I refer you to Thom Hogan, dpreview or Nikonians. For those ready to step up to a pro level camera then the versatile D2X will make be an excellent fit for all many types of photography.","I've owned 35mm film Nikons (F2, F3HP) since the mid 1970s, and have added D70, D200 and D2X digitals to the fleet. With the D2X, it's doubtful the film cameras are in for much work.<br /><br />There is nothing I don't like about the D2X!<br /><br />Battery life is phenomenal! I've shot over 10Gb and chimped most of them, and the battery level doesn't drop on the indicator. The camera has a high speed crop feature that allows me to shoot 8 frames per second if necessary, and which imparts an additional magnification effect to any lens being used.<br /><br />In addition to the full range of modern Nikon lenses the D2X accepts and meters with all my old AI manual Nikkor lenses as well. Autofocus with it and various Nikon AF lenses has always been quick and sure - I've never missed a shot I wanted due to autofocus lag.<br /><br />Others have spoken of the quality of the images, and I can only say that I can't tell a properly printed 8.5 x 11 D2X image from a film print.<br /><br />The D2X is large - you won't drop it in a fanny pack for a walk around the zoo - but I like the feel and balance. The camera is well-built and sturdy. It's an expensive piece of equipment, and worth every penny.............","I have been using manual film cameras for years. I wanted to get something a bit smaller, faster, more convenient. For someone used to the electronic 35mm cameras this would be the way to go. Photo quality and convenience is excellent.<br /><br />  The problem I found with it is that in the controlled environment of the studio I would always have it on full manual controls. I was using it the same way that I would use the old fashoined film camera with no batteries. While the Nikon takes excellent quality photos, my banged up old RB67 with a set of KL lenses just blows it away. It cannot even come close to the photo quality of the 4x5 camera. Add in the amazing capabilites of the 4x5 view camera and that is still the studio workhorse.<br /><br />  Of course when it comes to working with models, a view camera is not the ideal choice. I was hoping for a replacement for the 6x7 for working with models. The sets almost always tricked the exposure meter and I was back to using the light meter with the camera on manual settings. No advantage to using a computer camera there. You are still working at manual speed. While the photo quality of the Nikon is excellent, it still does not compare to 6x7 with good lenses for enlargements.<br /><br />  For location shoots with models the computerized automatic everything Nikon comes into its own. It is definitely an improvement over the RB67 in speed and ease of use. But the photo quality cannot match the RB67. The auto exposure and focus is definitely much easier on the models. Is it worth the sacrifice on photo quality? I am still undecided about that.<br /><br />  When it comes to landscape photography the Nikon stayed at home. The 4x5 view camera is the only choice for that.<br /><br />  The Nikon D2X is an excelent camera. But I think that it is not for me. I primarily use medium and large format equipment. Medium format is slow. Large format is very, very slow! And expensive. $2 to $3 per exposure for large format film plus processing. Digital is fast and cheap. For landscape and studio work I will stay with film. Medium and large format film is the way to go there. That is most of my work. For on location work with models, the Nikon gives medium format some competition.<br /><br />  The Nikon D2X is an excellent camera. My problem is mostly with the format and no tthe quality of the camera. If you are doing product photography for a big catalog, the Nikon is the way to go. If you are photographing wedding the Nikon is the camera for you. If you are doing portraits for clients the instant gratification for the client is quite useful. I think that the Nikon D2X would be the ideal choice for sports and wildlife photography where long fast lenses come into play. For the artsy stuff, big formats and film are still the way to go.<br /><br />  I have sold the camera and replaced it with one of those tiny $500 point and shoot cameras. The cheap camera fits in my pocket and does a suitable job for the family photos and such. The cheap camera works great for vacations. I will stay with the film for the professional work.<br /><br />  The Nikon D2X cannot beat a larger format film camera when it comes to studio or landscape work. It may be the choice for working with models on location. Economics makes it the choice for product, wedding photography. Coupled with the big fast lenses it is definity the camera of choice for sports and wildlife photography. The Nikon D2X is an excellent camera. But it is not the camera of choice for the work that I do.","I swore I would never leave film.I was willing to absorb the film costs to keep myself involved in serious image making.I owned classic Nikons from the past,Hasselblads,Linhofs......I was unimpressed with all the digital \"toy\"cameras that were rolling out.And was unimpressed with collegues gushing about their new DSLRs,especially when I saw their prints(kinda sorta like film?No!).......<br /><br />Then I started reading reviews of this camera...and went to a local dealer and got my hands on one.BEST made Nikon I ever saw!The images are superb!<br /><br />Sold all my film equipment.Gone.Not missed.Happy and shooting far more images(and keeping more)than I ever have in my 30 year career!","All of the great things you see in the other reviews are true.  This is a fabulous camera with outstanding capabilities.  It is also a very demanding camera.  It is demanding of your shooting techniques.  It is demanding of the lens you use with it.  It is demanding of computer capabilities.<br /><br />This camera captures such incredible detail that it demands proper handholding techniques.  This is complicated by the heft of the camera.  I upgraded from a D70 and thought I had pretty good technique, but it actually took several weeks of effort to improve and really get tack sharp images.  I thought there was a problem with the focus on the camera until I realized images taken on a tripod were perfect.<br /><br />The true capabilities of the camera only come through when used with professional-level glass.  I had used both a Tamron 28-300 zoom, a very good lens, and a Nikon 70-200mm VR lens on the D70 and, obviously, the Nikon VR lens was better.  But, the difference between the same two lenses on the D2X is unbelievable.<br /><br />This camera will also place demands on the computer equipment and accessories.  Be ready to upgrade to 4gb memory cards.  Also, be sure your computer has the RAM to handle manipulating 70mb files.  If you use Photoshop and create many layers, be ready for the file size several times that size.  In addition to memory, you will need to have LOTS of hard drive space for all of the images you will be creating.<br /><br />I can recommend this camera to anyone wanting a professional-level DSLR.  Just be aware of the demands of the camera and have the supporting equipment necessary so that your experience is satisfying, not frustrating.","I am going to keep this review short and sweet, rather than go on about every wonderful aspect of the camera. You can tell a lot about the camera simply by reading the specs, but they do not tell the whole story.<br /><br />PROS;<br /><br />-12MP have a lot of room to crop, I can crop down to 1/3 of the picture and there is still enough info for a decent 13x19 print.<br /><br />- Images are clean and smooth. I only shoot at ISO 100-200 and the images are noise free for all normal purposes.<br /><br />-GREAT COLORS. I am upgrading from a D70 and the colors are much improved. The D70 had a tendencey to wash greens, while the D2x has wonderful colors.<br /><br />(This is the part that really never makes it to the specs)<br /><br />- Responsiveness/ Handling. Nikon has always had the edge in ergonometrics, but the D2x/H take this to a new level. I have average sized hands and everything is right where it should be. The best thing is how everything happens INSTANTLY. You press \"AF-ON\" the picture is in focus. The viewfinder is beautiful and bright. The mirror blackout is so short you never see it go black in Single frame mode.<br /><br />-Two cameras in one. You can comapre this camera to the Canon 1Ds Mk II for high res landscapes and all that...AND you can compare it to the 1D Mk II for 8FPS sports action in HSC mode.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-It's big. This is not a small camera, in fact it's pretty huge and heavy.<br /><br />-It's expensive. (I think it is worth every penny....Well most anyway)<br /><br />-It demands good lenses to perform best. The D2x can resolve more than many consumer lenses, so wait until you have good enough glass to justify the D2x.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Great camera for just about anything, if you have five grand go for it, you will never look back!","I've been using the Nikon N70 for 7 years and although I've wanted to get into the digital world - I didn't want to spend a lot of money to get a digital SLR.  The thing is, I got so used to the features with my film SLR that when I bought my first 'point and shoot' digital camera (last year) the performance was so disappointing that I promptly returned it one week after purchasing it.<br /><br />Since I've 'grown' up in the Nikon world - I used my dad's Nikon before I got the N70 - I started to research which digital Nikon SLR I wanted to buy.  I spent months researching - almost bought the D2H during the firestorm sale earlier this year but finally settled on the D2X.<br /><br />After going through months of whether I should buy a D70(s) or D2X I finally read a post in which the author said he made the purchase because he wanted a digital camera that will last him for the next ten years.  I don't know if my D2X will last me 10 years - but one thing that I do know is that I'm extremely fussy and I demand perfection from my camera - of course assuming that I take the perfect picture too :).<br /><br />I didn't want to be worried about the resolution and the speed, i.e. the D70.  The D2H(s) was the next logical step for me but with the lower resolution and the high cost it just didn't make sense.  The speed was a critical thing for me and although I'm not a sports journalist I wanted my camera to be very fast.<br /><br />My advice to anyone looking to buy a digital SLR - if you don't have the money or don't want to take out a loan - buy the D70.  If you like to play with the latest in technology or want the ability to take the best pictures and have complete control over your picture taking - buy the D2X.<br /><br />Beware though - it takes a lot of learning and a lot of practice to master this beast.  I've had it for a couple months and every time I use the camera I'm always learning something more about it, but I love my camera and I love what it does for me.","This camera, if used the way its manufacturer demands is excellent. There is a problem. Suppose you have a need to mount it on a telescope or a microscope or a T mount, or on a bellows. Then you are out of luck, saddled with a technical miracle but intended to limit your photography and imagination to what Nikon wants you to have. If you want your camera to serve you in however you need to use it, you are better off with a light meter and a much cheaper rig.","I've been waiting for a long time to finally switch to digital.  For the last four years, I've shot 35mm transparencies and scanned them with a film scanner.  For me, switching to a digital SLR (and justifying the expense of these cameras) meant getting all the functionality and performance I came to expect with my F5 and images that I could easily print at 13x19 without any (or much) interpolation.<br /><br />The D2X does all of this, and continues to blow me away each time I use it.  Here's my general highlights of what I find important;<br /><br />1) Build quality and ergonomics are outstanding.  The viewfinder image is bright and I can manually focus my lenses in most situations if I want to.  I don't have huge hands, so some of the controls require a little stretch, but nothing that is too difficult to manage.<br /><br />2) The 3D Matrix II meter is AWESOME.  I get great exposures, even better than my F5.  In addition, the Auto whitebalance is excellent.  It is possible to fool it, but it gets the situation right 95% of the time, especially outdoors.<br /><br />3) Autofocus is incredible.  The 11-point AF system gives me MUCH better frame coverage than I had with the F5.  It's also more sensitive and faster to aquire focus, even in low-light situations.  Although there are reports out there about focusing issues with the D2X, my camera does not have any problems.  What I HAVE discovered, however, is that it's REALLY EASY for the camera to lock-on to an object that is slightly offset from where the focus indicator is.  This is partly due to operator error-- you have to be really careful with your technique, and the fact that the actual AF sensors are MUCH larger than the little reticles in the viewfinder.  At least I can check my image on the LCD to see if I need to redo it.<br /><br />4) The LCD and camera menus are great.  More custom settings than anyone could imagine, but they are easily navigated and you can group them in banks.  The camera also has the nice ability to recall the last several functions you modified, so it's easy to get back to where you were if you change something.<br /><br />5) Battery life is excellent.  The Li-ion battery is small and light, and I routinely get about 700-900 images in one charge.  WAY better than my F5!<br /><br />6) Image quality.  Nothing short of outstanding.  This camera can out-resolve some of my lesser lenses.  I REALLY can see the difference between hand-held and tripod-mounted shots if I'm not careful.  I have as much resolution as I could possibly need.  NOISE:  I don't have any problems using the D2X all the way up to ISO 800.  In fact, compared to ISO 400 slide film, there is less noise with the D2X at HI-1 (ISO 1600) than film grain at comparable ISOs.  At ISO 640 or less, there really isn't any noise issues at all.  Anyone who says otherwise is either reading too many test results or pixel-peeping.  Images viewed at a normal distance look FANTASTIC.<br /><br />In summary, the D2X is a total replacement IMO for slide film.  It may even compete with medium-format in terms of resolution.  This camera is a tool for professionals, and it will DEFINITELY expose any flaws in your technique or lenses.  That being said, I gotta go work on my technique some more!","This is the first real digital camera that I purchased.  Imagine dropping 5K for a camera sight unseen!  It is worth it!  I am an serious underwater photographer, and have shot nothing but film for years. This was the first Nikon camera that I felt was suitable for replacing a film camera.  I was not disapointed.  It is a wonderful camera, and has very very sharp accurate colors.  If you are considering a real digital SLR and are willing to spend the money this is a good camera to consider.<br /><br />If all you want to do is take snapshots, look at a D-70 or Cannon Digital Rebel<br /><br />Jim Christensen<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />For an incredible review which covers every aspect of this camera an more, check out [...]"]},{"name":"Olympus D-535 Zoom (C-370 Zoom)","amazon_reviews":["What a camera.

I have only had the camera for a short period of time and have gone through six (6) batteries already.  I have taken very few pictures which bothers me.","I was looking for a low cost camera that took decent quality pictures.  I found this camera is so easy to carry around and is so easy to use.  It tells you what each setting is supposed to be used for.  I use this camera for quick illustrations for work.  I love how easy it is to download my pictures to my computer.  It is a good fit for me and takes surprisingly good pictures for the cost.","I bought this camera for my teenage son mainly so he would leave my camera alone.  It is robust and a little bigger than mine which suits his larger hands but small enough to stick in your pocket.  He likes the fact that downloading to his computer is simple.  The quality is good enough for his tastes and he got a digital camera without breaking the bank.  This is our third Olympus digital camera and my husband still has our first one, a 1.3 MP which still works fine.","Wanting something user friendly and simple, I couldn't have found something better for the price!  Picture quality is great, easy to use and download to PC.  If you are a little intimidated at the world of digital cameras, definitely a good place to start!","The pictures are amazing.  The software is very easy to use and produces wonderful pictures that are by far better quality than drug store developing with my 35mm camera.  I researched cameras before I purchased this one and even though it is a lower end camera as far as pricing, I am more than satisfied with the performance.","When I received this camera, I didn't expect it to give me full quality shots with premium quality. I expected it to be a camera for simple small photographs that could fit in my pocket. It does a lot more. Olympus' D535 Zoom has a 3.2 MP interface that includes powerful 3x optical zoom and 4x digital zoom. Though the digital zoom isn't really a necessity, it can be useful at times. Another great feature with this camera is it's 7 modes: Automatic (for regular shooting), Portrait Mode (taking photos of people), Self Portrait Mode (for self-portraits), Landscape Mode (outdoor pictures), Nightlife Mode (for nighttime photos), Macro Mode (for close-up pics), and Super Macro Mode (for super close pictures). These features are very overwhelming. Therefore, a lot of button space is needed. The LCD screen is a mere 1.5\". Luckily, anything in this price range won't really get you more unless you search through thousands of websites looking for cheap prices.<br /><br />Many people with big hands will not like this camera. I reccomend Olympus' larger D540 camera for those with big hands. People with smaller hands will enjoy this camera. This camera lacks internal memory with a mere 16 MB worth of pictures. Therefore, an XD card is a MUST for D535 owners. I bought an XD card worth 512 MB at Office Depot the other day for $59.99. That is almost half the price of the camera. Rediculous, yes, but a must. Because it is so small, I reccomend warranties. Other features with this camera includes a self-timer feature that will last for 12 seconds before taking the photo. But, the self-timer feature is nothing without a tripod (sold separately). For those 'beginner' camera buyers, they'll want to try out a starter kit, which I have. It includes a digital camera case, mini tripod, cleaning kit, and a rechargeable battery kit, which is a very useful system.<br /><br />The picture quality is okay. You need a very sunny, very lighted room to get a good picture. That is where this camera falls down. You'll want to invest money in Photoshop Elements 3.0 or a different image editing program if you want to experience total 'photo quality'. But, if you are capable of getting into a well-lit area, you'll be lucky to hear that this camera will take splendid pictures.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />-Great Picture Capability<br /><br />-Great Optical Zoom for its Price<br /><br />-Great Brand Name that Adds Dozens to the Price<br /><br />-Cheap for A lot of Features<br /><br />-Modes<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-Small LCD Screen<br /><br />-Bad Pictures For Dark Areas<br /><br />-Small Size for Big Hands","I bought this for my mom who has a basic tech familiarity but isn't the kind of person who is going to want to hit 1000 buttons to take one picture. She took it on her trip and loved it! It can take short (soundless) movies and the photo quality was excellent.<br /><br />I would suggest buying rechargeable batteries though, since it can go through the batteries pretty quickly. But for a basic camera that is easy to use and takes great high quality pictures, get it! It is worth it. If you need giant photos or whatever for pro use, get a 5+ megapixel camera. For most people this is an easy and good camera for the money!","i love this camera!  so easy to understand, so easy to use... but most of all... so much fun!!","good quality all around camera... good quality photos... affordable... portable... convenient... handy... very happy with it!=) =) =)","The camera works great... definatley worth it! I use it like there is no tomorrow, and I have had no problems with it whatsoever!","An excellent out of the box camera that provides clear sharp pictures at a very affordable price. The software included wasn't used since I prefer to use San Disk readers rather than the included factory software.<br /><br />Almost impossible to beat the quality to value pricing for this camera with features you'd see in cameras costing $100 or more than the base price of this one.<br /><br />The only drawbacks I found were the delay in the shutter time which makes it very hard to keep steady long enough to allow the camera time for the auto focus mode to kick in. To resolve this I had to get a tripod.<br /><br />The next drawback is the size and shape of the camera. While it can and will easily fit into any size camera bag it is a little difficult to hold even for small hands and the shape of it is a little bulky in the front to back measurements making it awkward without a fixed base as your holding platform.<br /><br />Other than that though, it truly is one incredible camera that will deliver sharp crystal clear pictures in almost any type of setting or light.","I opened the box put in the batteries and went outside. Its very easy to operate. I took some great up close pics right away and d/l them onto my pc easily. The software for the pc was easy to install and i had no problem figuring out how to save or edit the pictures. I am excited !","The weak point of this camera is that it doesn't have an optical viewfinder (which is why the camera got 3 stars instead of 4 or 5).  While we've all seen people in bright sun holding their digitals out at arm's length framing photos in the LCD screen, the best way by far for normal shooting is to use a viewfinder you put up to your eye.  It'a more stable, easier to see in bright sun or if you wear reading glasses and don't have them with you.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a nice pocket size point and shoot camera.  As far as not being of \"professional\" quality, of course it's not; it's not priced or intended for that...it's a pocket camera that is easy to use and takes good photos if you want to point the camera and take the photo with minimal fuss.  All cameras of this type have a slight delay while they focus; if you're used to a film or \"focus-free\" camera (which means they don't focus at all), the right way to take a photo is by slightly pressing the shutter, then finishing the press when it focuses; this is normal.<br /><br />Take a look at the Oly D540, which is a similar camera with a viewfinder...you'll never regret having the choice of a viewfinder OR LCD screen, instead of being stuck with no choice.","What I liked about this camera:<br /><br />* Very small size. I was looking for a small size camera, this camera is even slightly smaller than the Nikon Coolpixs. It only requires 2 AA batteries, which gives you a very good battery life without significantly increasing the weight of the camera.<br /><br />* Priced right. There were not many good 3.2MP cameras with 3x optical zoom under $130 when I bought this camera.<br /><br />* Fancy features. I was very impressed with the quality of the video you can take with this camera. I was also not a very big fan of using the digital zoom, but you can take decent close ups using its 12x digital zoom if you need to.<br /><br />What I didn't like about it:<br /><br />* No viewfinder. You'll have to rely on the digital screen for taking all your pictures.<br /><br />* Requires XD memory. I don't believe the world needed yet another flash memory format, though I did like its small size. I recommend getting at least the 128 MB card, which will allow you to store about 180 pictures at a 1200 x 1600 pixels (at this resolution each picture requires about 600KB).<br /><br />* Not the best for \"semi-professional\" pictures. Although this camera takes very good quality pictures, if you're willing to spend an extra $50 for a better camera with similar specs, I recommend the Canon Powershot A510.","This is a good beginner camera.  I would put it in a class with the old Kodak Instamatic film camera - more than a toy but certainly not professional.<br /><br />Pros:  The camera is small enough to slip in a coat pocket, easy to use, takes decent to good pictures.<br /><br />Cons:  Batteries - Yes, it eats through batteries fast (and by this I mean the batteries must be replaced somewhere between 12-24 pictures depending on whether flash is used).  I did notice, however, that when the camera no longer likes the batteries, it doesn't mean they are truly dead.  So don't just throw them out - try them in a flashlight first.  In fact, if you let the camera rest awhile (off for a few hours or overnight) you may find that the battery indicator now seems ok.<br /><br />Dark Pictures - indoor pictures do tend to look dark, even with flash, but you can fix that with the brightness/contrast edit in the software that comes with the camera.  The downer is that you can't just print them as is right away without fixing the picture first.<br /><br />Picture Delay - There is a delay between when you push the button to take the picture and when it actually snaps the picture.  So, what this means is that you think you've snapped the shot but then you move the camera and find out that the real time it takes the picture is not when you press the button but a few seconds afterward. The result is blurred pictures, pictures of the floor or your feet or something else you didn't really want.  So, you have to be very careful when taking a picture and hold the camera very steady in position a little while after pushing the button to make sure that you get the picture.  Overall:  I don't regret buying this camera.  It is useful and handy since it's small.  But I wish I would have purchased something a little better.","It may be small but I have no problem with it. It takes great pictures for the price.. I purchased rechargeable batteries and they last quite a while. I don't use it every day. This is my first camera and I got this because the reviews were favorable especially for the picture quallity. I had some pictures printed from an online source and they were very nice, about as good as my 35 MM camera.<br /><br />Very satisfied and would buy it again.<br /><br />PS. It would be nice if they included a small case for it though.","This is my second Olympus Camedia.  The first one I bought 4 or 5 years ago.  I wanted one that took better close-ups for online auction pictures and this one is great!  I see some complaints about batteries, but this one is a lot better than the older model.  I am very pleased with the quality and the price of this camera.  My first one still works perfectly, just does not take good close-ups and really \"eats\" batteries.  I also purchased the AC adapter for this camera and use it indoors to save batteries.  I went through several Polaroid digital cameras before getting an Olympus.  The only complaint that I have with this camera is that when taking pictures on Easter, the auto focus knob on the back accidentally got turned and the pictures were fuzzy.  It is a little difficult for me to tell if the pictures are clear on the screen when shot.  I have to upload them to my computer to verify their sharpness.  Of course, my eyes aren't what they used to be.  Overall, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.","This is the fifth or sixth or seventh digital camera I've bought, so I'm starting to consider myself something of a minor authority.  While I adore my Fuji Finepix 2800Zoom, I wanted something smaller, stowable, and more \"rough and ready\" for a 3-week trip to Europe this year.<br /><br />Olympus cameras are excellent quality and excellent durability; this 4.6 ounce beauty is a marvel!  It goes in a purse or a pocket.  While some may say it is \"too small,\" my hands are small and I can hold the camera and take photos easily with one hand!  The photo quality is excellent outdoors and in good light.  The 3X optical zoom retracts and has an eyelid lens cover.  I took over 100 photos the first day with and without flash, reviewing the photos, erasing some of them, all using the LCD screen, and the batteries held up very well.  Note: this camera has no viewfinder.  All photos must be taken with the LCD screen.<br /><br />HOWEVER: I echo what the other reviewers said about the flash, it is very weak.  Not \"sorta okay,\" not \"borderline,\" but unless the batteries are fresh, the camera has had adequate time to charge the flash, and your subject is close, the indoor photos are \"poor\".  The reason for this is the same reason the camera is so little and light: only two AA batteries.<br /><br />I still love the camera, I gave it 4 stars ****!  It will be a wonderful travel camera. But I will have to work around it's limitations.","I just got this camera 3 days ago but I have already mastered its features. It is extremely easy to use and there are no confusing buttons or gadgets. The instruction manual is well written and easy to understand. I love the software it comes with. I have already uploaded pics onto my computer, edited pictures, e-mailed them, and created my own photo albums online to share with friends and family members. Overall a great camera.","We've had this camera for 3 months now and we find it very easy to use and not too hard on the batteries. I find that the displays on the back of the camera are quite easy to manipulate. In fact, I played with one at a store before I bought it here at Amazon.com (saved $15!) and I picked this one because it is so easy to operate that I haven't even been forced to consult the manual!<br /><br />There is a problem, though. The flash is seriously underpowered. If you plan on doing a lot of interior photography in dark environments, you will be disappointed.","I just recently purchased this camera and I really enjoy it. Its small for a girl and it has really clear pictures except for when you are trying to take a motion picture. Most digital cameras that I have used before has an mode strictly for pictures in motion but this camera does not. When trying to take a picture of moving objects everything including the object appears in a blur of colors. The camera has night vision, self portrait and landmark mode.. all of which makes the camera good but not great because of the lack of the ability to shoot in motion. I would recommend this camera, just not for concerts!","If your going to buy a camera, the Olympus Camedia is the camera for you! It has great close-ups on it, and enough onboard memory. I was deciding which i should get, an Olympus Camedia, a piece of junk Hewlett-Packard, or a Sony. I went with the Olympus Camedia right away. It almost used up all my money, but it was worth it, totally! Also, if your gonna buy one of these, you might want to buy some rechargable batteries and a charger, it just uses the batteries right up! I already took a load of pictures, and it takes the pictures so nice and clear, it makes all the other digital cameras look bad! This is a great little device, it does not record sound, but on the program it comes with a special thing, so you can add sound to your movies, you took, with the microphone on your computer. Pete","The D535 is my first digital camera and I think it is a great camera for the price.  The pictures are very sharp.  The software is easy to load and use.  The camera is easy to use.  I have been taking close-ups for ebay auctions and other shots inside and outside.  No complaints and nothing but priase for this little dude.  Yes.  It does suck up batteries but so does every other camera in this price range (I haven't looked at the more expensive ones).  The flash is weak, but I looked at the reviews of about 20 others cameras priced $100-$200 and they all had that problem.<br /><br />Yhe cover for the USB plug in looks a little mickey mouse but it is functional.  For $140, it exceeded my expectations!<br /><br />I often see wildly varying opinion on digital camera.  I tend to think that some people expected too much for their money.","This camera is extremely easy to use! It has everything most people need to take good pictures--zoom, landscape mode, portrait mode, close up mode, super close up mode, self timer, tripod mount(I had a Sony that didn't even have a tripod mount). Anyway, so far it has taken great pictures, but if you're going to buy this camera, be sure to also buy some rechargeable batteries. I just put in the batteries that came with it last night, and they were dead by this morning! Rechargeables will probably save a lot of money. This camera is also the perfect size. It's small and light. The only thing that it doesn't have is a viewfinder eyepiece, but that's no big deal to me because it has the viewfinder screen that is clear and sharp. It also doesn't record sound in movie mode, but it's still has everything else and it's a great camera!","I bought this for unknown reasons. I guess on a whim. But this is a dummy proof camera, it has a dial that you turn for all kinds of backrounds. I also have the Olympus 410 stylus. The photos are equal in quality only I feel this one to me is more durable. Takes 2 batteries and I put in a spare 32 memory card. I take the card out and use the HP Photosmart 375 and it prints fantastic photos! I notice there was another review downing the camera but for $140.00 I think it is a great deal. We just retired our first Olympus which I purchased years ago for $700. And it still takes great photos! I guess I will give it to my 8 year old. I am very pleased with this item, highly recommended. It's a basic camera and just a closing note there is no viewfinder you shoot through the monitor so you get what you see. I gave it to my 21 year old who is returning to new zealand in a month.","Be aware that this camera is not the 'Stylus' model that it is claimed to be. It is a 'Camedia'. If I had known this, I would have purchased it in person because the person I am giving it to specifically asked for a 'Stylus'.","I went to the store to buy the highly rated Nikon 2200, but then saw how good a value this camera was, and ended up by buying both. I later returned the Nikon.<br /><br />The camera takes very good photos and the quality of LCD is excellent. I compared the photos with those taken by the similarly priced Nikon 2200, and photos from this camera had better color, more detail etc.<br /><br />But one thing I am not impressed about is the flash. A lot of time, the flash leaves the image too dark. Sometimes though the image is perfect, so I am not sure if it is something I am doing.<br /><br />The camera is light, but a little difficult to hold on to. Next shot delay is almost non-existent for non-flash photos. For flash photos, the dealy is about 5 seconds mainly due to the flash charging. But compared to the Nikon 2200, flash charging was faster.<br /><br />The camera starts up quickly, and the zoom works well.The camera is small enough to carry in your pocket.<br /><br />In all, a very good value for the money.","This camera is a great travel camera, but it's too small for taking close-ups or telephoto shots. I prefer the Olympus cameras with 4 AA batteries (rechargable). They're much easier to hold steady when photographing a flower or distant object.<br /><br />There's such a thing as too small and this camera has surpassed my limit. If not yours, pick it up. Olympus cameras are the best."]},{"name":"Olympus C-7000 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["The camera is replacing one which had a shutter problem.

I must say, I couldn't be happier with a camera.  It's proven to be exactly what I was looking for.  The thing can take a beating and has never faltered in its ability to produce beautiful pictures.  It has some SLR type features (the ability to set shutter speed/aperature) that I didn't think I'd ever use, but ended up coming in quite handy.  It gives my Nikon D70 a run for its money.

The Nikon could handle a disappointing 8x10 before looking grainy and pixelated.

It's been a stalwart companion for nearly all family outings for the past 5 years (about).  I purchased a 1GB SD card after a year or two which greatly increased the storage capacity, but it kind of slowed down the responsiveness of the shooting (I think). There are many more adjustments on the camera than I have ever taken advantage of, the most useful I've found is the ability to adjust the flash intensity -- if I knew more about the technical details I might not have to take so many over/under exposed to get that setting ideal however.<br /><br />THe digital zoom is great. I've used the camera on more than one occasion as a sort of telescope.  If I can't tell what something is far away (or small) with the naked eye, I zoom in using the digital zoom and snap a picture.  The quality (given good lighting) is amazing on maximum zoom, and I'm usually able to see what the tiny little thing is at my leisure.<br /><br />I've not had any complaints about battery stamina.  The rechargable-ness of the camera is a key benefit -- and it's easy to pop the battery pack out, charge it up, and pop it back in.  I have used it on a number of times to take videos -- which is sometimes an option when the photograph doesn't come out.  If the camera is held still, and set on the \"indoor\" or \"night\" setting, it will take pretty good videos of kids at band concerts, etc.<br /><br />I do have to agree in some respects with the auto-focus comments of others.  For a while I never had a complaint, but sometime along the way I modified a setting and it seems to have gotten a little out of whack.  If you just depress the trigger button slightly, it will refocus pretty well, but by that time the 'kodak moment' may have passed.<br /><br />Our camera has been dropped, banged around, stayed in the car in the summer and winter without any ill effect.

I have worked as a professional filmmaker for over 28 years and have shot extensively with my full manual 35mm Pentax MX but this is my first foray into the digital still camera world. This camera makes me glad I made the move.<br /><br />Some other online reviews I read during my search made me apprehensive about the speed of the autofocus and the lag time in browsing through photos stored in-camera but, as I suspected, I think the other reviewers were being ultra-picky. What little effect I noticed, I found to be minor issues particularly when weighed against the many, many excellent qualities of the camera.<br /><br />The camera is responsive, intuitive and just plain takes great pictures with outstanding resolution and tremendous detail. The basic point and shoot setup is easy to use and very accurate but the camera also has the flexibility to satisfy my pro desires to tinker with the settings for variations in the end result.<br /><br />Some additional features I really like:<br /><br />1. The macro (closeup)capabilities are excellent and easy to use.<br /><br />2. The flash is always off unless you manually pop it up, then it can be adjusted from there. I dislike having a flash pop off whenever it feels like it and it's a pain to go through a menu to shut the flash off every time you power up.<br /><br />3. The viewing screen is big, bright and clear but the manual viewfinder is very helpful in composing a shot under sunny conditions.<br /><br />4. Most of the fequently used controls, including viewing and deleting photos, have dedicated buttons on the back of the camera which means you don't have to hunt through lots of menus to do the repetitive work.<br /><br />5. The camera feels well balanced in my hands and the controls are thoughtfully laid out.<br /><br />The only downsides I've noticed so far are:<br /><br />1. A relatively short battery life which I solved by simply buying another battery for about $35. I also purchased a 1GB chip which gives me lots of room to work with.<br /><br />2. I would like to have a little wider zoom on the short end (maybe a 28mm equiv. instead of the 38mm equiv. provided) and a little faster lens on both the short and telephoto ends but cameras that included these features seemed to cost quite a bit more money so I can live comfortably with this camera for the price.<br /><br />I am not an expert (yet) in digital photography but I highly recommend the Olympus C-7000 as a solid, well-made, easy to use camera. It is exactly what I was looking for.","bought this camera to replace a DX series Kodak.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br /><br />- I was excited, at first, by the manual controls, but disappointed by the difficulty of using the pre-set modes when in a hurry (who wants manual all the time?). The option for pre-setting 4 \"my mode\" settings is great, though.<br /><br />-  The color results are not impressive, I frequently find myself changing saturation and reshooting.<br /><br />- Battery life is not great and the battery is very expensive. You will need at least one extra at $35 a shot.  Also inconventient for international travel.<br /><br />- Finally, On two trips I have lost pictures when the camera has malfunctioned. Refuses to turn on and/or erases the XD card.<br /><br />- Did I mention the good picture quality? When the camera works and the saturation is controlled, the pictures are great.<br /><br />I have had the camera for 2 months now and it is on its way back to the store.  Good thing membership warehouses have generous return policies.","This camera has most of the features of my two well equipped Nikon FE's. It is a supplement and learning tool. Pluses: light; one unit not twenty; mostly complete; macro to tele; good price. Minuses: too small for my XXX hands (made a handle); No print manual; media & battery propritery. Has lived up to its promise and grows as I learn. Has usual CCD low contrast but I compensate easily. Would like to use filters but that's for the replacement camera.","Thsi is a correction to Mitchell Small's review and his comment about the Olympus Master software and TIF files where he states \"You can save the image as a JPG or TIF, but there is quality loss involved.\"<br />While he is correct about images saved in JPEG format losing quality, TIFF is a lossless format. TIFF files are larger than JPEG of course but files converted from the RAW format to TIFF retain the full quality of the image. The TIFF compression scheme is lossless, meaning no information is lost and preserving the full quality of the original RAW image.<br />You can read up on the TIFF file type at [...]","This camera packs a lot of features into a small little camera.  However, the focus issue is HUGE for me.  I have little ones that I'm always photographing, and the auto focus issue doesn't cut it for us.  Family photo taking?  This camera isn't for you.  Even using auto focus mode (battery draining indeed), and using a flash indoors, you will take several pictures before achieving a sharp picture. In the meantime, your subjects will be temporarily blinded by the \"red light\".  (A big complaint from our family).  Not too great for those impromptu moments of catching your children's smiles and \"firsts\" on camera.<br /><br />After reading the other reviews, I think this one is not a keeper for us.  On a positive note, it does allow the experienced photographer to venture out of the \"box\", more so than most digitals.","I concur with the other reviewer in that when the camera manages to focus correctly, the pictures look great.  But be prepared to through out 30% of your pictures due to focus/blurring problems.  I to have tried numerous camera settings and have yet to find the magic formula.<br /><br />The 7Mb image size is great and the 30 times zoom are very nice.  Also, the camera powers up and is ready to snap pictures very quickly (much faster than any digital camera I have owned).  I am going to stay with the camera, but I am a bit unhappy with the focus problems that I have to deal with, especially in lower light conditions.","This camera is a fast little camera with lots of nice features. It is a battery-hog however, so be sure to buy an extra battery or two for it. It takes around 2 hours to charge the lithium-ion battery pack to full capacity.<br /><br />The camera takes sharp pictures, but has a small amount of vigneting and slight barrel distortion at all focal lengths. These irregularities will not be noticed in most instances however. The onlt times they really become noticeable is when shooting bright plain subject like a light-colored wall or the sky, where the vignetting is seen, or when shooting architecture where the barrel distortion can be seen by a discerning eye.<br /><br />The contrast-based auto-focus is quick and precise in bright light, but tends to stumble and hunt in low light or low contrast situations.<br /><br />On the up-side, the camera offers true-colors and accurate white balance. The ability to put the camera in complete manual exposure mode is big plus for those who want to break-away from the novice auto-program scene modes. This little camera also offers a manual focus option, but with no real distance scale to go by, it is very limited for practical uses.<br /><br />The size of the camera is small and will fit in most any shirt-pocket without a problem. Easy to stow away and a great alternative to luggging a heavy and bulky SLR around when doing so would be inconvenient.<br /><br />The optical viewfinder is very small and dim, with no information displayed except for the focusing-brackets. The LCD screen makes up for it though, with a bright, sharp, easy to read display.<br /><br />The menu system is fairly simple and easy to navigate, making it a snap to change settings quickly. The advanced manual covers all the settings and how to change them, but is only on a disc in adobe .pdf format. A paper manual would have been much more convenient.<br /><br />Compared to the few other 7MP p&s cameras available, the Olympus Camedia C-7000z is a feature-packed little camera for a decent price.","Having purchased an Olympus D-580 a few months back, and not having been thrilled with its auto-focusing ability for indoor photos, I decided to splurge and purchase the C-7000 after considering the Canon G6 and Sony DSCV3. The C-7000 has an AF Illuminator that the D-580 doesnt have; I figured this would solve the auto-focus issues I had experienced with my D-580 while taking indoor photos. Wrong. Under indoor, lamp-lit conditions, the C-7000 often takes several seconds to focus and then, when the green \"focus indicator\" light finally comes on, a quick glance at the monitor reveals that the camera is obviously NOT focused. (And, your subjects will probably be wondering how much longer they're going to have that red AF Illuminator shining in their eyes.) Having said all that, I will admit that after using and practicing with the C-7000 for awhile, you sort of \"get the hang of\" (for lack of a better term) the auto-focus and can achieve acceptable results. I also found it helpful to adjust the camera to \"always auto-focus,\" which is an added drain on the battery, but seems to improve focusing performance. But, all things considered, I'd prefer to just be able to point the camera at my subject and shoot rather than wrestle with an inferior auto-focus. For a $500-$600 camera, I think Olympus can do better.<br /><br />On the good side, this 7.1 megapixel camera does take very good, very high resolution photos (see my samples) and is solidly constructed (aluminum and plastic). All sorts of settings, ranging from full auto to full manual, including aperture priority, shutter priority etc... I basically leave it on auto, but I did go in and increase the color saturation and the contrast a bit. This compact, easy to carry camera also has a nice selection of features as well (I couldn't get the red-eye reduction feature to work, but oh well: I can fix those better on the computer, anyway.) The C-7000 also allows you to take black-and-white or sepia photos, but you have to switch into either mode BEFORE you take the pictures, whereas the D-580 allows you to make B&W or sepia versions of photos you've already taken. Battery life is decent; it takes just under 2 hours to give the battery a full charge, so buy a spare. The C-7000 uses a proprietary battery so you can't just swing into a convenience store and buy some Duracells to throw into it...<br /><br />The big question: If I had it to do over again, would I still go with the C-7000? No. I'd choose between the Canon G6 or Sony DSCV3. But, I'll stick with the C-7000 for now. Over time and settings adjustments, I suspect I'll learn to like this camera.<br /><br />2/19/05 - Update<br />After using this camera for a month and a half, reading other user's reviews and forum postings, I realize that the C-7000 does have critical auto-focusing issues. I called Olympus tech support and spoke with a gentleman who suggested putting the camera in \"night\" mode when taking pictures around the house. He then suggested I use \"sports\" mode when taking pictures of the kids, because \"they're always running around.\" Why the camera won't focus when my kid is sitting perfectly still in a chair smiling patiently at me while the auto-focus grinds away remained unexplained. At any rate, I decided to email Olympus through their website - hoping the question would reach someone who understands the difference between auto-focus and exposure settings -  and ask about the C-7000's auto-focus issue. To date, I've received no response. My advice? Steer clear.","As an owner of 2 canon cameras I was not expecting to buy an Olympus. I decided I wanted a digital camera(my first) for Christmas/Birthday (my husband loves it when he knows exactly what to get) and after MUCH research and thought I concluded I wanted the C-7000.<br /><br />I received it from Amazon.com 7 days ago and have had not one moment of regret. Within minutes of opening I had the xd picture card and battery loaded and had taken a couple of pictures. Then I charged it for two hours as instructed.<br /><br />What I noticed immediately is how easy it is to use. It is easy to hold, feels very sturdy and has a rubber grip on the front right side. The compact digitals always felt too small to hold comfortably. Trashing unworthy images is painless and navigating the menus is straightforward.  I have not read the ins and outs in the manual (product of having a 16 month old) but I have the basics down.<br /><br />I must admit to being behind the times, my computer has win 98 and the software \"bundle\" is not compatible. This has not created a problem as I do have a mult-function printer (hp 2400) which has a xd slot. Pop it in, it downloads quickly and without any input. From one screen you can then edit, email, print and save. I can't imagine it being easier with another program.<br /><br />I had considered buying a backup battery immediately but have decided to wait and see if needed. I have used this camera quite alot in 7 days and the battery shows full powere after only that initial 2 hr charge.<br /><br />BUY A OLYMPUS 512 MB XD PICTURECARD<br /><br />i got mine a couple of days before the camera arrived and boy am I glad. Yesterday I went to a party, a house full of one year olds and their mothers. I then discovered it is hard to take a bad picture with this camera. I came home with 78 pictures and those did not include obvious trash (ie blurry or child half out of picture) It loads quickly, focuses quickly, flash cycles instantaneously which are all important as one year olds do not hold still for anyone especially mama. I forgot to use the flash (one button pop-up) and it compensated very well for low light.  better than my 35mm would have when subject is backlit.<br /><br />I am looking forward to using and exploring the more complex options of this high powered toy. I still have about 240 pictures I can take on this card without deleting any.<br /><br />Closing thoughts: I think this camera is competitive with the SLR models selling for a couple to several hundred more dollars and is more convenient. You don't immediately need a backup battery but I would get a 512 mb olympus xd card (only olympus cards allow you to use panoramic function)","I'd like to split this review into different sections: The Camera, Implementation and Bundled Software.<br /><br />I'll begin with the negative impressions first.<br /><br />Implementation<br />One of the driving forces behind my new digital camera purchase was that I'd outgrown my old camera's capabilities. My skills had reached the point where having a camera that saves images in a RAW format was highly desirable. When screening my choices, the C-7000 came in at a reasonable price while offering this feature.<br /><br />I must digress for a moment here. It seems that RAW format is not a universal standard. My present imaging software, PhotoShop CS, lists RAW formats from a variety of vendors. Apparently all are unique. While the C-7000 was not specifically mentioned, the C-8080 and C-5060 were mentioned, as were several other Olympus models. Additionally, Adobe has proposed an open standard for RAW formats, dubbed DNG for Digital Negative, and the same list of cameras appears on the list of supported formats that may be converted to the DNG format. Once converted, a DNG image may be read by any program utilizing that format.<br /><br />At least that's the theory. Olympus seems to have changed their specs for RAW from the other cameras in their line up as neither the DNG converter nor PhotoShop, with the latest RAW reader plug-ins, is able to read an Olympus Raw Format (*.ORF) image from the C-7000. Major disappointment! Other than ORF images, I had no trouble reading any other images.<br /><br />Bundled Software<br />The inability of my software to read an ORF image lead to the installation of the included Olympus Master software. Installation is painless: insert the disk and an auto-install wizard takes over. Once installed, the software is ready to go.<br /><br />Personally, I felt the software was aimed at a first time camera user. The interface was so simple I found it almost insulting. I mean, come on, do you really need a wizard to help you e-mail a photo or print a picture? You also don't need the software to transfer images to your PC (see The Camera, below). I found nothing in the software, or advertised features, to warrant the expense of upgrading to the \"full version\" at a cost of almost US$20.<br /><br />While the software is capable, especially if you have no other image enhancement software, there are some serious shortcomings. I hate to keep harping on the RAW format, but it's a problem here too. You are free to manipulate the image, but you can't save it to another RAW format usable by any other product. You can save the image as a JPG or TIF, but there is quality loss involved. That's what the RAW format is supposed to avoid. Olympus, PLEASE sign on to the DNG standard or at least offer the ability to convert these RAW images to the same format as your other cameras that are supported by third party imaging software.<br /><br />The Camera<br />Now we're getting to the good stuff! Ten minutes after unpacking the camera, I was off and taking pictures. It's that easy. The controls were different from my old D-460, yet intuitive enough there were no major problems. Even if this was your first digital camera, I estimate you could be taking your first digital photos in less than half an hour. The setup folder is easy to follow. I used the battery without charging it and got about fifteen exposures before I ran it down. Fully charged, I'd expect about a hundred exposures before recharging.<br /><br />Now that I had some test shots, I wanted to see them. Without reading the manual, I simply plugged the supplied USB cable into the camera and then plugged the cable to my PC via a hub. Windows 2000 showed a notice that new device was detected and in a couple of minutes I received a notice my removable drive was ready to use. No additional disks to insert for drivers, no Internet searches for drivers or anything more complicated than finding an open USB port. Windows Explorer showed the new drive and I was able to navigate to the photos, drag `n' drop to a temporary folder and I was able to view them with my graphics viewer of choice (JPG images only). I'd expect the same to be true for Windows XP or Mac users.<br /><br />The only customization I'd done to this point was selecting an image size of 640 x 480 to maximize the number of images stored on the supplied 32 Mb XD flash memory. During use I was impressed with the speed it wrote to the memory. On viewing the images, I was impressed with the evenness of the exposure, accuracy of focus and quality of the flash. Using a tabletop to hold the camera steady, I did some available light work with exposures of one to two seconds length. The resolution is impressive as is the contrast of the images. I don't have any objective data to back my results, but I'd match this camera against any other fixed lens digital camera on the market. Superb optics!<br /><br />Another major surprise was the camera body finish. The brochure describes it as Titanium. I don't know if Olympus is describing the color or the actual material, but it certainly isn't plastic! The shell has a nice solid feel in your hands and, while I wouldn't deliberately drop it, it gives the impression of ruggedness. Holding it you feel your money was well spent.<br /><br />Conclusions<br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this camera. I bought it because I wanted something compact and rugged, yet easy to use. I bought it for the quality of the camera and the picture taking ability of the camera, not the software. In time, I'm sure my problem with the ORF images will be solved and the image format in no way interferes with the camera's abilities. I would suggest two accessories to purchasers of this camera, both of which are based on common sense, not any shortcoming of the camera.<br />1) Get an extra battery and always keep a charged spare with you.<br />2) Buy the highest capacity XD card you can find. You'll use it!<br /><br />To Olympus I'd suggest offering some conversion of this new ORF format to DNG and perhaps marketing another package that is priced to include the camera and XD memory without the proprietary software. While the software may be useful to some users, it is an unneeded duplication for others.<br /><br />12/23/2004<br />Adobe has solved the problem of reading the RAW format. There is a new plug-in for PhotoShop, RAW 2.4 Beta, that allows me to read the ORF this camera generates. I still stand by my 4 star rating based on the quality, or lack there of, of the bundled software. The camera by itself earns a full 5 stars, it's the total package that suffers.","I had done a lot of research prior to buying this camera. I previously had owned an Olympus Camedia C-2020 (2.1 megapixels) with which I had not had any problems, but I was ready for the next generation of digital cameras. I needed a smaller size, but more capabilities, especially more zoom. I had narrowed by choices to the Canon S1 IS, the Olympus c-765 or C-770 or the Fuji S-5000.<br /><br />A local photo shop hosted a manufacturers rep day and I went and had some great conversation. When I first saw this camera I was amazed at all it could do, despite it's small size. 5x optical zoom, 20x total zoom, 7.1 megalpixels and a size that allows it to be carried in your pocket. You can read all the fancy specs at a lot of good review sites, checkout [...] but before you buy a camera in the $400-$550 range, check out the Olympus S-7000.","My perfect camera has to do two things very well.  First, it has to deliver superior results.  Second, it has to be portable.  I think this Olympus C-7000 comes the closest to perfect and this is the one that I bought.<br /><br />For superior results I thought I wanted a dSLR, but after handling one I realized I wouldn't often want to take something that large and vulnerable with me.<br /><br />The Canon G6 and S70 are the only other cameras that I took any serious interest in.  The G6 was tempting but still a little thick (especially the grip bump).  The S70 was tempting too, but still longer than the C-7000.<br /><br />Neither Canons offer as much zoom as the C-7000 (5x optical), though they both offer a wider angle.<br /><br />I gave only four stars because I still wonder how it compares to the G6 in light gathering ability.  Maybe I'll upgrade it to five stars once I settle that issue.<br /><br />I was determined to buy a Canon or a Nikon.  I had no thought toward buying an Olympus.  This camera impressed me enough that now Olympus has a new customer.  Nice job Olympus."]},{"name":"Konica Minolta DiMAGE A200","amazon_reviews":["This camera was rated good and it was in excellent shape.

Better to shoot at 2560X1920 (battery will afford several hundred shots vs less than 50 with 3264X2448) If used correctly it is possible to take portrait shots with a background bokeh effect similar to what you would find with a DSLR 50mm portrait lens. Put the zoom on manual & pull it out to 200mm on your subject/head/body framed... This gives you a cropping factor of about 4x which equals about 50mm with full frame DSLR.

Now bearing in mind that the A200 is my first digital camera, I do have to say that I was, and still am very happy with it.  The auto focus is dreadfully slow on the default setting in low light situations.  However, I took the advice of the Jan 3rd 2007 review, and have eliminated that problem.  The pics are noisy ISO 400, however I think I've used that setting 2 times in the year that I've owned it, not a problem for me.  One more pro and one more con.  First, this camera has a EVF or electrical view finder. This is opposed to a optical view finder that DSLRS have, or better yet, like all of the film cameras have / had. This can make composing pictures with movement a bit difficult. You're not viewing the scene in real time, so there is a bit of a lag in time between any movement in the scene and what you see through the view finder.  Not anyhting that would make me not use the camera, just a little tricky in certain situations.  Another pro about this camera is the fact that is has a ISO setting of 50.  Most camers do not include a ISO this \"slow,\" the slowest end ISO's on most cameras range somewhere bewtween ISO 100 and ISO 150. This isn't a feature I use constantly, however I do use it, and I like knowing that the option is there when I do want to use it.  I have taken some really nice pics with this camera, now, they don't (and digital pics never will) compare to a beautiful color slide or contrasty B&W print. Still, this camera delivers,I have had some excellent prints result from using it. You really just have to read the owner manual and learn how to fine tune it. To this day (like the auto focus fix as an example) I am still learning how to improve on using it.  It might not techinically be considered a \"Professional camera,\" but you can definitely get \"Professional\" quality results from it.","Pros<br /><br />Wide Angle Lens is best in class.  Natural colors. Manual zoom. Threaded lens barrel.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />A bit slow, but do often you need fast shot to shot speeds?<br /><br />The Bottom Line<br /><br />Consider this trade off for a wider than usual wide angle, but less than usual zoom. You'll get more use out the wide end of the lens.<br /><br />Full Review<br /><br />KonicaMinolta was bought by Sony, who discontinued making Minoltas, but says they will honor the warranties. This means this camera is falling quickly in price. You can get it for almost half its original price.<br /><br />It has been knocked by reviewers for two reasons...poor autofocus and noise problems. The noise doesn't seem to be an issue, unless you need ISO 400 . Unless its almost dark, or the subject is moving quickly in low light, the anti-shake system means you can take almost any shot with ISO200 or even lower. You do get some noise with ISO400, but its still good for 4x6 prints. ISO800 is really noisy, but lets you photograph in near darkness without a flash, and the pictures look brightly lit. In short, I don't find the noise to be any more of problem than other digicams, and if you compare professional reviews, neither do most reviewers.<br /><br />As for the focus issue, the camera's default mode is the wide area focus. For some reason, the camera will often focus on the closest object in the scene, which may not be what you want. This is especially common indoors. I don't know what the advantage of this wide area focus is, but it certainly causes problems with low light focusing. You need to get into the camera's menu and change it to Spot Auto Focus mode. This mode will let you select one of eleven spots for it to focus on. Select the spot in the middle. The camera will now behave like any other autofocus camera, and will not have any focus problems.<br /><br />Once the focus problem is solved, there is plenty to make this camera my favorite. The best feature is the 28mm equivalent wide end of the 7x zoom. Most digicams have a 35mm wide end. The difference is noticable in landscape shots, and in indoor shots. You will really appreciate this wide lens. Sure, other zoom cameras have 10x/12x zooms, but much of your photography will be done with the wide end of the zoom. My old camera had a 10x zoom, and I found I hardly ever used the high end, but often wished for a wider wide angle. With 8 MPs, you can zoom and crop on the PC if you need better telephoto.<br /><br />The anti-shake feature really works. This camera replaced an Olympus C2100UZ with image stablization, which for its time was top of the line in big zoom digicams. I can say I'll never buy a camera without an image stablizer/anti-shake feature. It lets you take handheld pics in low light with low ISO. It also lets you take pics from a moving platform, like a car or boat. Its not perfect, but it works most of the time.<br /><br />The custom white balance works just a bit better than the camera's auto white balance does, and you can save two custom settings and easily switch between them. This is good if you are moving around between different types of lighting. Speaking of saving settings, you can save all your resolution/white balance/exposure/color settings into one of 5 memory spaces. This lets you set the camera up for five different situations, which are quickly accessed. This is much easier than changing many settings settings as you move indoors/outdoors and through different lighting situations.<br /><br />The controls are arranged nicely, and there's even a nice rubber thumb pad that helps you grip the camera. The manual zoom ring works better than an electric zoom lever found on most cameras. The manual focus ring is useless, because the monitors are not high enough resolution to judge focus. Luckily, if you make the above change in the autofucus, you won't need the manual focus, except in extremely low light. The manual focus can then be used to set the focus for the approximate distant to the subject.<br /><br />The A200 has a threaded lens barrel, which lets you leave a UV or polarized filter on it, without the cumbersome adapter tubes that most cameras use. The lens cap is high quality, and won't fall off, unlike many cameras. It also has a flash hot shoe.<br /><br />The picture quality is very good, especially after you learn to use the menu settings for exposure and white balance. Color is natural, instead of overblown. Canon is the biggest offender at overblown colors. Notice how much red is in a Canon photo. The A200 pictures will have accurate color, especially if you use the right white balance setting. Of course, if you like the overblown color look, there's a menu setting to turn it on. The camera's auto white balance is ok in a pinch, but if you have time, the colors look a little better with the custom white balance. If you like to play with Photoshop, the A200 can shoot in Raw, which lets you adjust white balance and other settings on your PC.<br /><br />There simply isn't a better combination of resolution, lens, automatic settings and manual controls out there, unless you go to a digital SLR. An SLR with enough lens to duplicate the A200's would cost much more than the A200. For most folks, the A200 will be more than enough camera, yet it's still simple enough for a novice to use. A novice could start taking pics right away with this thing, and then develop his craft by experimentation with all the manual settings available.","In English<br /><br />she is my favorite... . it enchants to me. it is small cofashion, practices. the screen is helpful since I am very short. and I can raise camara or to remove... or to remove photos from the floor with no need from tirarme.. to do it... I have removed photos at night with triprunes and without. they very leave or those that remove in very slow slow speed. or in bulb. they enchanted to me... very recommendable. but I have found out that konicaminolta this letting do them... is a true pain. because it is by much very good... for my anything that to envy to other used marks but. excellent. I recommend it.","I've been using Minolta equipment of some sort for over 20 years now.  Had a 7Hi which is a good camera but this a200 is even better.  8 Mega pixels is way better than 5.1 -- the movie options are better (800x600) -- the anti-shake feature is a lot better than the 7Hi.  Limitations however are as others describe--battery is difficult to find, if you use the RAW format (which why would you NOT use the maximum capacity of the camera) it becomes a storage hog.  I routinely convert the RAW file to TIFF to use with iPhoto and suddenly a 11 MB file jumps to over 45!  Ouch!<br /><br />I am currently in the middle of switching computers and I hope that using Apeture will create a lot of hard drive space that was otherwise soaked up by this supersize TIFF's.<br /><br />Durability--the 7Hi is a durable day to day camera--dropped it a lot--finally had to buy a new camera because the power switch broke internally.  The a200 is a tempermental camera--I'm on my second because my first one got dropped gently onto pavement from a car seat--no big deal I thought until I turned it on and it was clearly out of whack -- couldn't focus properly and there was a slight vignette on one side.  Sent it off to be repaired--this was March--months later (July?) Sony says they won't fix it (no parts etc--)  I insist they do have parts and to send them.  Meanwhile I bought a new one for less than I spent on the first one and it's been dropped twice and it doesn't seem to mind.  Sony has agreed to reinburse my cost of the first camera but I can't get either the repair place or Sony to write me a letter.  Sony is very bad in my book these days.  Camera wise anyway.<br /><br />I use my a200 as a day to day haul along in the car to take pictures of whatever as I see fit.  It is great for this sort of thing--flowers, fall leaves, people, cars, whatever.  It is a good all rounder without spending thousands of dollars.  I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for my bad experiences with Sony trying to get them to honor the warrenty.  Bad Sony!  =(<br /><br />Things I have that I'd get more of--more than one spare battery, a spare charger, at least 1 GB flash card -- haven't tried a faster type of card to see if that improves things but it does get slow with the RAW setting--but the movie option makes up for that.<br /><br />I'd get a high end camera like a Canon but they don't offer a movie feature--nor do they have a swivel view finder (really do use that feature regularly).<br /><br />For $500 or so--it's a good deal--especially if your'e like me and just don't want to invest big bucks in something that is too easily damaged, lost, or out right stolen.","I have travelled to Europe twice and counted on this camera to bring back great shots, and I haven't been disappointed. Added the wide angle lens and it has been outstanding.<br /><br />The only thing negative I would say is that the batteries are hard to find if you are in a foreign city.","I reviewed my a200 last summer, I thought it would be interesting to note how I feel about the camera now.<br /><br />For the majority of people wanting a \"pro\" looking camera without having to buy all the accessories it'll do, but I've run up into several limitations.<br /><br />A lot of people haven't heard that Konica-Minolta has left the camera business, and in particular this camera seems like an orphan stepchild.  There's no battery grip or underwater housings available, nor any extended batteries save the very expensive and hard to find EBP-100.<br /><br />Last fall I bought a Nikon D50, and the difference couldn't be bigger.  The Minolta has an incredibly slow autofocus, an ISO sensitvity of only up to 800, lots of noise in the pictures, and the RAW format files are something like 11 megs per picture.  It has little infrared sensitivity and good luck getting anything other than a Minolta flash for it.<br /><br />The higher sensivity of the D50 pretty much negates the advantages of the Minolta's \"anti-shake,\" I just turn up the sensitivty or use a wider apeture, and the pictures look fine.<br /><br />The average person will likely say, \"yeah, but I don't care about all that,\" in which case the a200 would be a good choice for them.  I quickly found myself hitting it's limits, and grudgingly keep it as a backup camera/camcorder.  The movies it takes are actually pretty good, but even then there's some workararounds.  Quicktime isn't supported very well by free movie editors, and the included verion of Ulead only makes Video CD's.<br /><br />I pinched for a copy of Sony Vegas as I can use it for other things, but it's gotten to the point I no longer care for this camera and wish I hadn't spent so much money on it.  Bottom line, if you're serious about doing real photography, get a digital SLR.","I have had a Minolta film camera for many years and was very pleased with it so when I decided to shop for a digital camera I already new about Minolta's quality.  I knew I wanted a digital camera with @ least 7 MP, and this one has 8!  Took me a little bit of time to figure out all of the features and get used to shooting with a digital camera, but I am so pleased that I bought this one.  Even without the close up lens, (which I plan to buy when it is available) I have taken shots with this camera, uploaded them to a photo gallery online and had them enlarged up to a 20x30 and the quality IS AMAZING!  I would also suggest the Tiffen filters that not only protect your lens but also give you some amazing effects!","I spent hours researching the many digital cameras on the market and their reviews.  I decided upon the Minolta A200 because I previously owned some Minolta film cameras and liked the image quality.  I'm unsure what my expectations were with the A200.  For the first week I had it, I despised it.  I had even called Minolta Customer Service but it was a Saturday and they weren't available.  I read and re-read the manual.  I searched on the internet and learned additional information about aperture settings, ISO, and shutter lag.  By week two, it wasn't the broken camera I thought it was.  By week four, I had taken some really nice photos and learned a lot about its many features.  I have a long way to go, but I've had this camera for five weeks now and am really quite attached to it.  It has some shutter lag between the RAW shots and in low light, but with a little patience and some creativity with the controls, the photos are quite good.  After having talked with friends about auto focus and low light, it appears that it exists with most digital cameras.  Still, I've taken photos with the A200 in extremely low light situations with minimum movement, of course, and the photos were very good.  I recently took pictures at a birthday party for a two-year old.  I didn't use a flash at all and the party was indoors due to rainy weather.  95% of the photos were without any blur.  I have often found that flash pictures, at least when I take them, leave the subject bright and washed out so I try to avoid flash pictures whenever possible.  I also used the A200's video capabilities recently.  I forgot to change the video setting back to the picture setting when taking a family photo so I ended up with a video of everyone saying \"Cheese.\"  Some mistakes are blessings in disguise.  The video auto-focus at the smaller setting makes a clicking noise, but at 800 x 600 I haven't noticed any noise at all.  The zoom can also be used while taking video though it takes just a couple of seconds to refocus on the subject(s).  The color pictures (natural setting) are true-to-life, the black and white setting is really fun, and the macro is adequate.  I rarely use the \"Vivid\" setting.  I did purchase the close-up lens, but have learned that the wide angle macro is fine and crops nicely. From my findings, it appears that the close-up lens must be used at a determined length to be in focus and the center of the subject is in fine focus but the outer area can be fuzzy.  I will probably not use it enough to have justified its purchase.  I did purchase the Konica Minolta step-up ring (49mm-62mm), the Konica Minolta Circular Polarizer (62mm recommended by KM to prevent vignetting which it does) and a 62mm metal screw-on lens cap for the filter to protect it.  These were NOT inexensive filters but in my opinion a worthwhile purchase. There is very little grain at ISO400 so I am pleased about that.  I'm still learning about photographing action shots.  My success has been minimal in that area but it probably means learning more about its many settings.  My only wish for this camera is that it had a 300mm zoom.  Still, with 8MP, cropping works just fine.  I have become very attached to this camera.  It has been and continues to be such a rich learning experience.  It is NOT a camera for someone who is expecting a point and shoot.  It will certainly disappoint. It will not have the shutter speed of a dSLR.  It requires some patience in low-light, but the results are really nice.  I am quite happy about this camera and what it can do.","I am a graphic artist, and I am thrilled with the pixel quality of this camera. I see no color mis-alignment as in other cameras. I am especially thrilled with the anti-shake technology; I have been able to shoot indoor pictures at night under ambient light with no tripod! More than half of my shots are not blurry!","You can read about all the cool features (and trust me, there are a lot of them) from konica minolta's website, but what I really want to attest to that you can't always necessarily trust from the manufacturer's website is QUALITY.  If you want really high-quality pictures (and are willing to take some time to learn how to use the settings properly), then this camera will not disappoint you.  I'm hoping to start selling my photos in the near future, so image quality is extremely important to me.  I wanted to get a dSLR, but simply couldn't afford to get high-quality one with a decent assortment of lenses comparable to the 28mm-200mm lens (22mm - 300mm with accessories) that the Dimage A200 has.  Eventually, I still plan to get a dSLR so that I can have such luxeries as a 600mm telephoto lens, but for now, the A200 is performing better than I could have hoped for and has all the same settings that most dSLRs have (except for interchangeable lenses of course).  Maybe some other people got lemons (or aren't using their cameras properly), but the autofocus on my camera is working perfectly.  I must admit that it's slower in low light situations, but it almost always gets there eventually (and in the rare instances when it doesn't, you can use the direct manual focus to fine-tune it...not the easiest thing in the world, but it does work). The battery doesn't last as long as I would like, so I recommend getting at least one back-up.  I got a generic one for about $15 after tax and shipping and it works great.  Also, I want to clarify that the camera DOES NOT lose its settings when the battery is changed (this could be because I have a spare battery and can replace it immediately instead of waiting for it to charge, or other people got lemons or aren't using the cameras properly). The camera's built-in macro capabilities aren't fantastic (i.e., you can't get very close to your subject), but getting the close-up lens (CL49-200) solves that problem.  Now I have crystal clear pictures of things I otherwise never would have seen (e.g., a butterfly's tongue).  Also, if a 200mm lens isn't enough for you, you can get the ACT-100 telephoto converter to extend your lens to a supposed 300mm (however, my personal experience shows it to be something more like 290mm).  And that's my only real complaint about this camera (which I was fully aware of before purchasing it)--I just wish it had a longer lens.  My old camera had a 380mm lens and I really miss having that much range.  Then again, if the A200 had a 380mm lens, it probably would have bumped up the price to something I couldn't afford anyway.  All-in-all, this camera is fantastic and anyone who takes the time to learn how to use it properly should not be disappointed.","The quality of the this camera and lens is good but the auto focus operation is quite poor. Low light auto focus is next to impossible and even in good light the auto focus performance is quite slow. The EVF performance in low light is not very good. I was hoping this camera would be my answer to an \"almost SLR\" but it underperformed. Picture quality was good and flash performance was quite good as well.","I have had mine for several months now & like it overall. It doesn't have everything I want, & more than I need. It's just under a DLSR & much better than a point & shoot. The features are easy to use, once you remember to set them. Change the battery, lose your settings. There isn't an internal battery, so you have to reset everything.<br /><br />One BIG problem with this camera that I didn't notice till I needed it. Shooting in the darkness of night! Man what a pain!! It doesn't like night shots, even with the night portrait feature! If you want to take a shot of the moon, you MUST use a tripod. Even than it's not exact. Any movement & the shots is blurred. The camera takes forever to focus enough to take a shot at night, & you can't hold it that long.<br /><br />I've heard people talk about indoor shots. Yes, they suck! Especially if the lighting is with halogen lamps! Even shooting in RAW mode, the pix come out harsh. You can manipulate the shots when in raw, which is great! So don't be discouraged.<br /><br />Unless Minolta/Konica updates the firmware so it can shoot better, I'd look at other cameras if you're going to take any pix at night (moon, fireworks, Chritmas decorations etcc).<br /><br />The bright side. You really don't need the additional lenses. On full back (normal position), the shots are quite wide, & zooming out is great too! I have the monster wide angle, it offers more, but only for vast landscapes, bigger than a house.<br /><br />Macro or close up shots, WOW! I bought a fake flower to practice on, & you can see the thread lines. I have their macro lens & am buying additional lenses for close ups.<br /><br />When shooting people, be careful. This camera doesn't miss anything (except where to focus). Every blemish shows up, it's an 8MP that's what it does.<br /><br />High speed shots, this thing is wild. It's like an old movie clickety clickety. Keep in mind though, the shots are quite small on the fastest setting. You can catch a bird flying, but movie mode will too (at a better resolution).<br /><br />All in all, I love this camera. I have some accessories & a few bags for it. It's light (plastics help), turns right on & goes to town. Keep in mind though. Battery life is small. I have two batteries & keep an auto converter handy for the charger. Also, Ultra or Highest speed CF cards are the way to go. Especially on RAW+JPG. RAW is 11.5 megs plus the jpg shot. You can get an update from Minolta for using 4gig plus cards, when you want to shoot more. That's about it. I'd suggest buying it, even with the flaws. It's fantastic, quick to use & light. You can carry all of the pieces on a hike & not be greatly concerned. One more thing! The buttons are sensative! When it's on, you'll change things quickly when you pick it up & touch a button.","I bought my Dimage A200 about 6 months ago based on extensive research for a prosumer point-and-shoot camera.  I own a Nikon D70, and was looking for an alternative to lugging around my D70 and all of my accessories.  At the time, I was torn between the Dimage A200, Canon Pro1, and the Nikon 8800.  In the end I found an incredible deal at my local store and got the Dimage A200.  Since then I have found so many features on this camera that the only accessories that I find necessary to bring with me is a Circular polarizer (49mm.), extra battery, and the supplied Lens Hood and remote control.  If you already own this great camera, the Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 is the PERFECT camera bag for the minimalist photographer.<br /><br />The features that I discovered include the ability to control Filter Level on camera at a range of +-5. Although not perfect, this allows me to leave all of my warming and cooling filters out of the bag. In addition, when switched to Black and White image capturing, you can select from 10 different color filters and levels that include red, blue, green, purple but no yellow (oh well).<br /><br />One of the reasons I chose this camera was because I can have the ability to have near total manual controls.  When I set my A200 on manual, I set the viewfinder to \"Exposure Priority\" and with the use of the Live Histogram, I can look for the exact effect before I release the shutter.  This puts the guesswork out, but I also have the ability to use the Exposure and Filter Bracketing function when necessary.<br /><br />With the different combinations in options a photographer has with the A200, it would be irresponsible for me not to mention the \"Memory Recall\" mode.  In any mode, i.e. manual, shutter priority, aperture priority etc. I can save all of my current settings via the \"menu\" into any one of 5 slots.  As a reminder for myself I make a note on a standard Post-it note that fits perfectly in the LCD cut out. This feature is such a lifesaver especially when shooting in that little window of time during the dawn and dusk hours of the day.  Not only are all of your setting saved in the Memory Recall mode, but any setting that you leave in the \"creative\" modes, will be recalled upon selecting that mode even after you power off and change batteries.<br /><br />The \"White Balance\" set to auto and the preset white balance selections are decent, but the ability to save 2 custom white balance settings gives a notch above the competition especially useful when moving between two different lighting situations.  Just have to remember to bring a white index card in you bag.<br /><br />\"Color saturation\" and \"Contrast controls\" give yet another creative options to your pictures.  Most cameras that I've run into only give you a High Medium Low settings for color and contrast.  The A200 instead gives +-5 degree levels.<br /><br />\"Second Curtain\" flash sync is a selectable feature that controls when the flash fires being at the beginning or the end of a long exposure shot.<br /><br />The flip monitor as mentioned in other reviews is such a big seller for me, being a previous owner of the Canon A80 and now the Canon A620.  An unmentioned ability of this variable angle monitor is to shoot \"around the corner\" having the camera 90 degrees left or right not just above or below as mentioned in other reviews.<br /><br />I know I haven't mentioned all the features of this camera, but I figure you could get that from reading other reviews.  By no means am I comparing the A200 to my Nikon D70, I am merely suggesting that the A200 is my Compact and especially Lightweight alternative (19.5 oz with battery).  I gave the Dimage A200 a 5 star because of the loaded features and the ability to have complete manual control over your shots.  All of the features I've mentioned can also be accessible in Program mode (virtually AUTO mode) for those that just want to point and shoot.<br /><br />UPDATE: Another year later.<br /><br />Now that a year has passed since I wrote this review on the A200 I feel the need to update this thread.  Unfortunately Konica Minolta has left the digital camera market and has sold to Sony.  The Sony Alpha that has been released in recent months is in essence KM's 5D with some improvements.<br />My A200 is still serving me well but the new cameras being released are starting to outdate my camera.  Startup time, time to first shot, refresh rate and low light of the new cameras on the market has significantly been reduced.  Anti-shake and anti-blur are finally starting to show up in new cameras, where not even a year ago, the A200 was one of only a few that possessed this function.<br />The movie function on the A200 is still right up there having the ability to shoot at 640 X 480 @ 30fps and even goes as far as 800 X 600 @ 15fps.<br />With all the improvements in digital camera technology, I am disappointed in the fact that manual zoom barrel did not catch on.  Shooting in full manual mode (that includes exposure and focusing) is still pleasure with this camera.  After shooting over 22GB worth of photos from this camera, all of the buttons, screens, and all the moving parts are still in great shape.  The only sign of wear to me is the rubber grip for the thumb is starting to loose its stick to the camera.<br />I noticed that a number of users have mentioned a concern regarding the difficult to find battery replacement.  With little research one would notice that the Nikon EN-EL1 is the identical battery, and is very common.  I have been using 2 additional EN-EL1 batteries that I bought off of ebay since I bought this camera 2 years ago and they have served me well.<br />It's almost time for me to move on from this camera.  When I do make the plunge, I may go to a DSLR, if not, then I would seriously consider the Panasonic DMC-FZ50.","I did a bunch of reseach before buying this camera. I wanted something that was more then a point and shoot but less then a dSLR which costs a bit more then I can afford these days. I knew going into it that the AF wasn't the best for the camera, but the Antishake and the ease of adjusting the ISO, Apeture, and Shutter Speed made it a worthwile purchase.<br /><br />This thing shoots really really sharp low noise shots in even the darkest corners of rooms. Write times aren't that bad, only a bit long if your shooting RAW.<br /><br />This Camera also has a really cool mode called Ultra-High Speed that shoots like 40 frames a second. Its great for capture really high speed moments in time.<br /><br />I also really like the manual zoom. It really gives you the feeling of control over the camera.<br /><br />The only drawback is the AF, but you can overcome that with the Direct Manual Focus feature, which lets you override the AF by turning the focus ring.<br /><br />If you can afford it, buy it, it won't let you down.","I have shot Minolta cameras for 40+ years and they are as good as it gets.  This camera will do just about anything you want it to. If you are an advanced amateur, as I am, you will love this camera.  Very versatile, and though it is mostly plastic, it is Minolta quality throughout.  I highly recommend it.","I purchased this camera a couple of weeks ago. I just love this camera.  It is so easy to use even in manual mode. I just have to turn a mode knob  to apature or shuttle and turn a little wheel by the snap buttom to what I want.  On my olympus 740 this was in a hidden menu and ended up loosing the perfect picture by the time I got there.  The 7x manual zoom is more then enough. A lot quicker turning something myself then hitting a button and waiting. A $10 set-up ring allowed me to use my extra lenses and filters that I had with my other camera.<br /><br />My two complaints<br /><br />1. The on/off button is inline with the snap button.  The first couple of times I turned off the camera instead of taking a picture.<br /><br />2.  I havn't figured out how to turn off the sound.  It plays  music when you turn it on.  It also make the sound of a manual camera when taking a picture. This is nice but not when you are trying to take pictures of animals in the wild.<br /><br />This camera would be great for beginners and even an amatures that don't want to spend the price on a digital slr.<br /><br />Just be carefull about who you buy it from.  I had a scammer on Amazon that tried to get me to western union him over seas. Never pay for anything on Amazon unless you use Amazon payment system.","Although I've had the camera a short time, I've found the quality similiar to my Minolta 35mm SLRs.  At first I thought the learning curve was going to be a daunting task but if you take it one step at a time its not so bad; its just remembering all the features that K-M has given you in one small package.  I do wish that the camera had a longer telephoto like the Z-5, however, the lens range is what I use the most often anyway.  With the card adapter that I purchase, I can use both Compact Flash and SD cards.  People mention size and compared to my 35mm SLR they are similiar and the A200 is a good secure fit for the hand.  I also appreciate the range of the adjustable LCD viewer, it certainly makes it easier to handle some of those shots you want without having to get in awkward positions.  I probably could have given it 5-stars but I need more time with it.","As a owner of 2 other 35mm SLR cameras and a digital camera I didn't expect this camera to take photo's as good as my film cameras. I was supprised with the detail and sharpness in the photo's this camera took. I took photo's using macro mode of flowers on a bright summer day and the color came out perfect. This camera has everything except the ability to change the lens. The 28 - 200mm lens works great. In short I would recomemnd this camera to anyone who wants more than a point & shoot and expects great photo's. A great camera.","I have been interested in photography for years, but this is the first good quality camera I have ever owned.  I found this camera very easy to use right out of the box.  After just a few minutes I got up the courage to take the camera of auto and see what else it could do.  I found the menus easy to navigate and was able to produce great results with just two days of practice.  The macro setting is amazing and the anti shake feature lives up to its promise.  I haven't even needed to use a tripod.  I am extremely happy with my purchase and look forward to getting many years of use out of this camera.","I was really undecided on whether or not to get this.  I have a HP Photosmart 945 which is a decent but not great camera, and had recently gotten a DXG flash \"camcorder\" for shooting home movies and whatever.  Some of my indecision was all the higher end cameras like this one use compact flash memory and proprietary batteries, while the \"consumer\" models get by on SD cards and AA's, rechargeable or otherwise.  SD cards are darn cheap, and AA's are everywhere.<br /><br />However, I really felt the limitations of the 945, the worst for me being very slow writing to the memory no matter how fast a card I used.  It eventually came down to this or a Rebel XT.  From the sample pictures I've seen the Rebel is a better camera, but it's much more expensive and to really take advantage of it you need to buy extra lenses.  Plus, I had to admit to myself I'm not a professional photographer.<br /><br />The selling points to me on the A200 were the anti-shake mechanism and an advertised movie mode of 30fps.  I was a little skeptical of the movie mode, as the 945's \"movie\" was something like 233X200 at about 15-20 fps and poor quality, and I didn't expect much better.<br /><br />So I ordered one and UPS delivered it a few days later.  At first feel I thought I'd made a mistake, the A200 is plastic and feels like it.  It's real little, much smaller than I expected.  The manual zoom is just a sliding cylinder...I thought I'd bought a very expensive plastic toy.  That is until I took the lens cap off, and thought, \"That's a nice piece of glass.\"<br /><br />To shorten my next few days the A200 is capable of great shots, but you can still take lousy ones if you're not careful.  The focus and detail in the pictures are fantastic, as well as the color.  But it does take time to learn to adjust the settings.  While it does have an auto setting it's not a generic point and click, and you're wasting your money if that's how you take pictures.  While the manual zoom felt cheap at first, now I positively love it over the push-a-button zoom most cameras have.<br /><br />I was initially disappointed with the anti-shake, and wondered if it was even working.  It will enable better quality pictures in dim light down to about three shutter speed settings below what you could otherwise.  Setting my shutter speed on manual I got down to about 1/15 of a second.  Telephoto shots in daylight is where it really shines, just remember to use the spot focus in the center of the image (normally it's predictive) and they'll come out sharp.<br /><br />The movie mode, however, blew me away.  I got the little DXG mostly because I could take movie clips of any length, and was willing to live with mediocre quality at 320X240.  It has a very limited light range where it gets good results.  The A200, however, is like going from grainy first generation videotape to HDTV, it's that much better.  The movie length may \"only\" be about 10-15 minutes per clip, but unless you're putting your camera on a tripod and filiming an entire event, do you really need to take clips that long?  The A200 lets you edit clips in-camera, and comes with movie editing software, plus for Mac users it saves to quicktime format.  One caveat is to turn off the autofocus, otherwise the little typewriter noises will drive you nuts.<br /><br />The only real weaknesses I've seen in this camera is the indoor white balance for natural light photos has to be manually set to tungsten, otherwise the pictures have a marked yellow cast.  This  to me is a minor problem as it takes two seconds to adjust it.  What is very annoying to me is how small many of the buttons and controls are.  In particular the main function ring, which has a control button in the center, makes it hard for me to press that button without activating something else instead.  However, this seems to be the trend in cameras as they're all getting very-very small.<br /><br />Overall for people wanting more than the average camera, but not wanting to go to all the expense of a DSLR, or wanting to combine a camera with a decent camcorder, this is a great buy.","Overall, this is a very nice camera. I bought it because a few weeks ago I used a friends Canon EOS Digital Rebel to shoot some pictures of his son's baptism. I really realized how much I missed a zoom ring and an a manual focus ring on a camera. I did some research and decided the DiMAGE A200 was the most modern camera in its class, had the best feature set of any SLR-like camera at the best price and had a manual zoom ring on the lens.<br /><br />These reviews probably tend to be overly positive since the author just invested a bunch of money in the product and would be unlikely to trash it. But I am genuinely very pleased with this camera. I am by no means an advanced photographer. But I am simply not attracted to the small one-dimensional point-and-shoot cameras. I guess I am the absolute intended target of the A200. My initial impressions, based on one day of playing, is that this is a very advanced camera. The feel of the camera is excellent. The weight and size are just enough to give a solid feel while still compact. Controls are very intuitive and reading the manual for a few minutes lets you jump right in to some very advance, but easily programmable features. Basic guidance in terms of navigation etc. are supplied at the bottom of each screen. Particularly nice are the 5 sets of programmable image settings. These then are available on each startup on the `MR' setting. Very easy and excellent feature that I have not seen mentioned too much in the more formal reviews. Consistent with comments in some of the more detailed reviews on the web, colors were a bit muted on the `native' color setting, and the AF was a tad slow indoors or at high zoom. Color can be either enhanced by selecting the `vivid' setting or offline in the supplied software. Oddly enough, color seemed better on the tele-macro setting than on the regular setting. The DiMAGE viewer software is simple and straight forward. What I really like is that it does not look like a product of the Disney company. It is clean and professional looking and is clearly intended for a pro-sumer audience. Anyway, back to the camera. In general this is a really nice camera and I am certain that as I become more familiar with it I will take better photos. However, I would mention that one immediate point that struck me, and that I have not yet seen in online reviews, is the quality of the auto white-balance indoors. It consistently gave very yellow images. This was very easily remedied with a few buttons to set the white balance to either the pre-set `tungsten' setting or by measuring it and saving in one of two memory settings. However, I was surprised that this was necessary. Outdoors, automatic white balance was fine. This may prompt me to stick with my Olympus 3040Zoom for indoor shooting and use the DiMAGE primarily for outdoor shooting where it really shines. A few minor odd-bits: I can't seem to understand what the reason for the `control wheel is' in that every function it serves is redundant to other control options on the camera. For some reason the designers felt it necessary to build in artificial shutter sound effects when you take a picture. I suppose it is a good thing to have sound verification that the exposure has taken place, but is a little juvenile. Luckily, all system sounds are easily changed, turned down or off.<br /><br />Pros: Excellent fit, finish, feel and dimensions. Excellent documentation. System firmware is simple to navigate and full-featured. A welcome return to a manual zoom ring. Easy to use features and intuitive navigation. Very useful preset image settings. Practical and functional software package with an adult user interface.<br /><br />Cons: Disappointing auto white balance indoors. Lens cover has no attachment strap and will likely be lost within a year. EVF is a little grainy, I would never use it for manual focus. The LCD is much higher resolution and more suitable for manual focus.","The GREAT:<br /><br /> This camera has absolutely AWESOME image quality. I and my wife have used the macro feature on flowers, spiders, lady bugs, kids toes.... anything. The level of detail this camera can get with macro controlled AF + 10x optical zoom is just great.<br /><br /> The exposure controls are easy to get to with a quick-menu button that gets to only white balance, exposure, ISO, and whatnot. Other buttons are laid out intuitively when you get your hands on it. Program mode allows you to adjust f/ after AF-half press with a simple wheel behind the shutter release. Great preset modes. Quick preview button is a cool feature if you don't want the images to pop up every time you snap one off, but want to see the last one easily when you please.<br /><br /> The anti-shake really does help taking pictures with the 10x zoom. (please, for the love of all things holy, DO NOT use digital zoom! You can crop later and get the same image!!) Actually, i turned on the AS as soon as I took it out of the box and never looked back (feature also has a button to easily turn on/off to save battery)<br /><br /> The camera also comes with the Full version of Quicktime for video editing, and a basic photo viewer/editor. The DiMage viewer is O.K., but not as feature rich as a Photoshop nerd like me would like, and not user-friendly enough for a beginner. I would rather Konica struck a deal with Paintshop/PS-Pro from Corel than pay software developers to make mediocre software.<br /><br /> The could-use-work:<br /><br /> The cycle time with the flash on is not great, 3-5 seconds maybe (didn't get a stopwatch out), cycle time with RAW is atrocious, but I think would be better if I had a pro CF type II high speed card instead. The internal RAM gets past the write time on smaller files, but can't keep a full 12mb RAW image and<br /><br /> The really annoying:<br /><br /> This is not an action camera. This is not a low natural light without a flash camera. This is not a low light AF camera. HOWEVER: When I can get it to focus in lower light/indoor levels, the Anti-Shake made better pictures without a flash than my Canon A75 ever thought of.<br /><br /> Also: The only camera in this class I've heard of having great low-light AF is the Sony DSC-V3 because it uses a laser to find the subject. AND: If you want precision-fast AF, get a Digital SLR. Overall though, I feel the AF on this camera is sub-par even with my little caveats no matter what light level. Konica-Minolta really should work on this in their next camera in the A series.<br /><br /> Conclusion: (...) I still have some reservations that I should have gone with the Sony DSC-V3, or the Panasonic DMC-FZ20k. But I'm in love with the zoom/macro/features/megapixels/image quality/buttons-buttons-buttons of this camera. I think I would have been more at ease if I had had a chance to get my hands on these models, which you usually can't find in a store. If you're a photo-buff on a budget, get this camera. If you're looking for a party/family camera with great resolution but only 4x zoom, I'd go with the Sony. The Panasonic is similar to the A200, has better reviewed AF, a Leica 12x lens, but the features/buttons aren't as cool and useable (i've read). There are other cameras from Kodak and Such, check out as many as you can to find YOUR camera. Make it fit what you're taking pictures of. BTW- if you're not planning to print over 8x10 size photos and stick with 4x6 and 5x7 prints from wally-world, get a 4-5 megapixel camera. You don't need 8 megapixels for that.<br /><br />(ps - if you want a 1300 mAh battery for this, Sterlingtek.com has one. Haven't ordered one yet. but pricegrabber has good reviews of them.)","This is soooo different for me.  I have a Canon Powershot G2 that I absolutely love.  I wanted to try a camera with an optical zoom and didn't feel like spending $1,000 for a Rebel that I didn't have any extra lenses for.  I also wanted to be able to use Compact Flash.  This camera takes some getting used to, but I can already see the potential for great shots.  My best advice is READ THE MANUAL.  It is very well written and easy to understand. With 8 megapixels to work with, it is easier to fix shots that leave something to be desired.","Let me be honest. I don't like digital cameras! I have a Canon F1 for 25 years that I have used to take pictures in Canada when it was -35c. When I want better quality, I have a Fuji 645zi. It will be many years before digital catches up.<br /><br />However, I have realised for a while that I am missing many shots in my day to day life because I don't think they are worthy of committing to film. So at the end of 2004 I started reading the magazines to look for a digital camera. And what a lot of nonsense I had to read!<br /><br />ANYHOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY HARD WORK - JUST BUY THIS CAMERA!!<br /><br />What is great about it is it works on auto straight out the box and its sharp 28-200 image stabalised lens gives great results on default settings. After a few hours, I changed the default colour setting to Vivid and moved over to shutter priority and got even better results.<br /><br />But this camera has over-rides for everything, including the ability to power the flash down to 1/8th power and use it to fire slave studio flash.<br /><br />It has 8mp and can shoot in RAW, RAW+JPeg or JPEG. it uses compact flash cards and I have been using a Lexar 1GB card with fast processing between shots.<br /><br />It also comes with a neat remote control unit, which allows self portraits etc.<br /><br />This is a go-everywhere camera. Very light and compact. Will become my camera for business trips. And with 8mp, if I take a shot I want to enlarge beyond 8x10, it can be easily done.<br /><br />Check this beauty out-you won't be disappointed","I have had a Nikon Coolpix 4300 for about two and a half years and in that time have taken over 2500 pictures.  One thing I definately wanted was a camera with a longer zoom. I travel by bicycle and like to carry my camera everywhere (that is why so many pictures!) so I did not want to go to the size and expense of a digital SLR. As I seached for cameras with longer zooms,  there were two I liked the range of- both the Canon Pro1 and the Dimage A200 which was not released yet. The 28- 200mm (35mm equivelent) zoom gives me a great range from wide angle to telephoto. A very useful range making many different pictures possible. I also was attracted by the anti-shake feature. A camera with a long zoom (some go to 300mm on digital prosumer cameras) is not useful if you cannot hold it steady enough to get a clear picture. Despite the length of the zoom, the camera is surprisingly compact at about 4 1/2\" by 4 1/2\" and easily fits into my fanny pack which is exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />  Another great feature is the adjustable LCD monitor which is sharper than the one on my Nikon. This allows you to aim over your head or at a low angle and still see what you are shooting at. You can fold it in facing the camera body to protect it and also to shoot using the EVF viewfinder which means you are using less battery power.  It will turn completely forward so you can do a self portrait using the remote control to trip the shutter.  The remote can also be useful for long exposures on a tripod like night shots. For night shots, it even has noise cancelation where it will take a second picture with the shutter closed to record any \"hot spots\" from pixels and subtract them from the final picture so it is clearer and doesn't have white dots on it.  I tried this and it takes great night shots- the best I have gotten with any camera I have owned.  I used a tripod of course.  This slows the time between pictures a little, but if you are taking this type of picture you are used to waiting.<br /><br />  The time between shots it pretty quick. Faster than my Nikon certainly. It has manual or auto focus (I used manual with it at infinity for my night shots since this like many auto focus cameras can have trouble focusing in low light situations).  The macro can be used at either the wide angle or telephoto ends of the zoom.  I have not really tried that yet.  Nor have I tried the movie format which is said to be very good. There are two resolutions you can use for that. That is not what I bought this camera for anyways.<br /><br />  I thought my little Nikon 4mp camera took nice pictures,but the Dimage A200 blows that away.  It is simple enough for a novice to use it on \"Auto\" but has enough features to please most professionals too.  I have mostly used \"Auto\" so far and as I become more familiar with the camera, I will be able to take advantage of more of its features.  I already have taken pictures with it that when I look at them I am amazed that I took them. They are very sharp- from the wide angle through telephoto. This camera fit my needs and then some- with the options available as I become more experienced with them. If you are serious about photography and yet want to keep it simple, this is a great camera! I don't need or want to carry all that other gear.<br /><br />  Notice I have not talked about the eight megapixels?  That is because it was not a consideration for my purchase and enjoyment fo this camera. Four is a lot for most uses especially since most users will not be making prints larger than 8x 10. But this camera gives you that possiblity.  I guess that sums up this camera the best- all the possibilities it gives you.  All in one small package. I love this camera!  Yes, the photo is what the eye sees, but this will definately help you to capture what you see. I very highly recommend it!"]},{"name":"Konica Minolta Maxxum 7D (Dynax 7D / Alpha-7 Digital)","amazon_reviews":["The average stars should be 4.7!

This baby reflects every aspect of my personality and helps me bring out my crazy photo ideas.<br /><br /> I hesitated and was patiently waiting till i could get it all together with the 28-75mm 2.8 lens, my second best was Nikon's D200, but i decided to follow my dream and i've been happy ever after. Sweet!!! 6MP is just fine with me, printing posters the size of a wall isn't my hobby, so why splash out so much to keep up with the Joneses?! MP count has nothing to do with the quality and a good lens like the one mentioned proves it. The camera is so well designed i barely use the LCD screen, it's on only to review the shot and get some initial settings done, buttons and dials are so intuitively laid out, one doesn't have to take his eye off to make an allignment!!! It's become my arms extention and i now see as if having a viewfinder always on me and the moment i spot something extraordinary i know i can take the challenge - i'm all set for it! Excellent job by KM!<br /><br /> I tried Canon 30D in a store before and after the purchase, surely the results are sweet, but it feels like a toy or like an aoutomatic transmission car compared to a well built solid stick shift! You drive it, not the opposite, that what makes your shots so differnet!","The Konica Minolta Maxxum 7D is a pioneer in the crowded field of digital SLR cameras. It was the first DSLR camera to incorporate AS (anti-shake) into the camera body instead of the camera lens. It seems like such an obvious no-brainer it's a wonder why nobody thought of it earlier. With the 7D, any lens you attach to the camera magically becomes AS enabled!<br /><br />That means every lens from a cheap $50 plastic kit lens to a $1,500 pro level telephoto lens. The other big camera brands (Canon and Nikon) put their anti-shake technology (Canon calls it IS, Nikon calls it VR) into their lens. And not all of their lenses have IS/VR. That means if you want anti-shake with Canon and Nikon you need to buy their special IS/VR lenses, and believe me you WILL pay extra for it. Another problem is that Canon and Nikon don't make wide lenses or fast standard primes with IS/VR. With the Maxxum 7D, any lens your heart desires will be AS enabled once you connect it to your camera. Simply awesome! Once you try photography with anti-shake technology, there is no going back!","I finally converted to digital this month and immediately took it on a two week trip to Italy.  Although the camera has plenty of options and adjustments available, the settings are easy to figure out and the small manual is understandable and is organized in a way to makes it easy to find the explanations needed.  The photo quality is excellent and the anti shake technology really works, even with my  18-200 mm lens.  I carried a spare charged battery since I seemed to use one up before I was finished taking photos.","This is a real bargain right now and soon you won't be able to get one.  Don't listen to a handful of the negative reviews. KM still exists, but now will be making cameras for Sony. It is supported by Sony and new lenses will be available soon.

I was afraid that this camera will be heavy as heck since on paper Canon touts that their cameras are lighter and more suitable for traveling and such.  I have not carried it on a long trip yet but initial impression on this camera is that while it may be heavier than other cameras, it's still a manageable weight for a 160-pound guy like myself.  This is my first digital SLR camera.  I have shot great photos with a Canon S400 but I feel it's time that I upgrade.  I had wavered between a Canon rebel XT, Canon 20D, and this baby.  Since I have a couple of Minolta lenses already, and supposedly this camera is in the same class as the 20D, this would be a more cost-effective solution without too much sacrifice on image quality.  The stock lens is horrible and feels like a piece of plastic toy.  Don't pay more than $20 for it.  I have a Sigma 28-300mm lens and it works great.  No incompatibility issues.  Great image quality.  Still need more time to read the manual to figure out what all the buttons do but it would be fun.  2.5\" LCD is very clear.","I've had this camera for several months, just returned from a trip to Europe where I shot 700 photos, also shot a wedding in the summer which was around 300 photos. I'm very happy with it overall. I've been a photographer for around 40 years, and I'm not too happy with the modern digital SLR cameras with their layers of menus for what I consider vital functions, not to mention the too-small controls. I looked at the Nikon 70s and the Canon 20d, I just didn't connect with them. As soon as I picked up the Minolta, it felt just right. This is a photographer's camera. I love having knobs that I can easily access without resorting to hard-to-read menus. I love the large LCD. The anti-shake works brilliantly, I've taken low light shots that I would not have gotten otherwise. Image noise is quite low unless you go to 1600 ISO or above, and I've had great luck with the noise filters in Photoshp CS.<br /><br />Niggles: the autofocus is not happy in many low light situations, and the meter gets fooled sometimes. These are not unique problems with the Minolta, just wishes for an ideal world. The body is a bit heavy, but personally I like a large camera with some heft to it.<br /><br />Overall, a well thought out camera that was certainly designed by photographers for photographers. I would not recommend this camera for beginners, as it lacks the auto modes that are typically found in entry level cameras, but experienced photographers (particularly old film camera hounds like me) should have a look. It takes wonderful images, which is what photography is about. Don't get sucked into the \"more pixels\" arguement, most of the specs quoted by marketing people are meaningless in the real world.","It's really a no-brainer if you already have some Minolta AF lenses, but even if you don't have an SLR kit this camera should give you something to consider.  The Canon 20D is a fine choice, too, but although it has a higher resolution sensor I'd rather have the 7D if I were just beginning to put a system together.<br /><br />Why?  The Minolta is a shooter's camera.  The ergonomics are absolutely brilliant.  Near perfect, even.  Plus, the viewfinder is a whole lot better than Canon's or any other body in its range that I know of.  That may not sound like a big deal, but it's very, very nice to have, especially if you do any macro work or need to focus manually for whatever reason.  Everybody needs to see what they're shooting!  I don't know why the other manufacturers don't realize this.  Another great feature of the 7D is the large LCD that automatically orientates itself when you shoot vertically.<br /><br />Then there's Minolta's anti-shake thing.  It really does work as well as advertised, so if you know how to hold the camera you can really bend the rules with low-light shooting.  The flexibility is awesome.  Now, it won't work miracles.  Don't expect it to give you a sharp photo if your subject's moving and you're shooting at 1/4\".  And you'll still want to use a tripod with that 300mm unless it's really bright out.  But, say you have Minolta's great 50mm f1.4 mounted on the camera.  You really can get away with handholding at 1/4\" in a lot of situations (provided, of course, that you have good technique).  That's what AS is for.<br /><br />The 7D isn't quite perfect, though.  Hopefully they've addressed this issue, but a lot of the early 7Ds (mine included) had to be sent back to KM to repair a backfocus problem.  In some cases they had to be sent back more than once (mine included again).  To their credit, KM has great customer service.  They're fast, attentive, and will pay for your shipping if you're unhappy.  They've also been known to give away batteries and such to people who've had trouble with their new 7D.  And it should be said that Minolta isn't the only company who has had problems like this.  Canon had it on their 10D (and may have had it with the 20D for all I know).<br /><br />Other than that, it's hard to find complaints.  When I got mine, it cost a little more than its competition and that kind of hurt when I bought it.  Now that I've had the camera for eight months, though, I can say it was definitely worth it.  I'm very happy with my choice and I wasn't even compelled to go with Minolta because I had a bunch of their glass.  If I had Canon or Nikon glass I probably would've stuck with them...I'm not sure that it's worth several thousand dollars to switch over (unless you have money to throw around).<br /><br />But do keep in mind that this is a long term decision.  I've alluded to the fact that lenses are the real investments in photography, not bodies.  In the long run you'll want to go with a brand that makes the glass you'll want to use.  If you're going to be a pro photographer, it may be best to stick with Canon or Nikon because they offer up a little broader selection of lenses than Minolta.<br /><br />But there's still another way of looking at it.  How often are you going to need something strange like a tilt-shift lens?  They're so expensive and so rarely used it doesn't even make sense for most people to buy one.  You can rent them if you need to, though, and you can also rent the body to go with it.  So I don't know if I'd be too afraid to go with a 7D if that's what I wanted.<br /><br />Anyway, if that review kind of rambled you have my apologies.","A good solid camera! I have the maxxum 7 film camera that the 7d is based on so the transition was very easy. I like the controls being out in the open instead of settings being buried in menus. It may look like you have to have an engineering degree when you count the buttons and dials (around 25, depending on what you include), but the controls are easy to learn as everything is clearly and logically marked. The anti-shake has been impressive. I have gotten acceptable sharpness from shots taken with a 300mm f4 wide open at 1/30th. Any panning or dragging the shutter seems to have better results with the AS turned off. With a fast memory card (sandisk extreme III) I get around 20 shots continuous before the camera slows to write to the card with a full buffer. A good camera that is even better now that the price has come down.","First of all, Minolta has a [...]. Go to their website [...].<br /><br />Minolta did have some problems at first. Backfocusing and download speed from the camera to the memory card. Both issues were taken care of free of charge by Minolta.Latest software version is 1.10.<br /><br />Now in regard to the flash overexposure. Yes some do dial in -1 flash exposure compensation while others say they have no problems. Not sure just how wide spread this problem really is.Again you can send it in for warranty check out, if you want.<br /><br />This is a great camera and with the \"Anti-Shake\" feature there's no need to buy special lenses. [...] :o)<br /><br />Happy trails,<br />Bill B.  (USA)<br />-------------------<br /><br />[...]","This camera is the best technology has to offer. I bought my Maxxum 7D at a camera shop along with a 1GB fast read/write card. The lens I purchased with is a Tamron 18-200mm lens, which is excellent by the way. I suggest getting a protective filter with multi-coated UV protection, it's a small investment of $14-$25 for a couple-hundred dollar lens. The camera is excellent, the anti-shake is absolutely incredible. The manual controls give you the feel of a professional photographer. You are not able to use the LCD screen as a viewfinder, it's only for reviewing photos and checking the camera settings. I don't suggest this camera for beginners because of the complexity and price tag on it. Start off with something smaller, maybe a Sony Cybershot or a Fujifilm Finepix S5100. It's definitely a break-through in camera technology.","I have been shooting a Minolta 35mm (Maxxum 7000) for over 15 years, the last three years as a professional portrait photographer.  About 18 months ago I decided to experiment with the world of digital and purchased a Canon Rebel, along with much additional equipment required in the digital darkroom.  After close to $2500 in equipment and supplies and $3000 in wasted lab bills that brought me nothing but \"plastic\" looking prints, I packed it all in a box and sold it to the first person who would take it...vowing never to touch digital again.<br /><br />But recently I kept reading reviews about Minolta's first digital SLR.  With the benefit of being able to use all my existing lens and equipment, I slowing got the bug to try it.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to say that after a brief review of \"where are the buttons\", I shot a few test frames around  the house.  And then added it to my next few portrait sessions (shooting both film and digital).  With some minor light adjustments in studio,<br /><br />my next two shoots went digital...<br /><br />  I may never buy film again.<br /><br />My biggest problem now is ... quit shooting so many frames just because I can!","I am no novice to photography and have used the Canon EOS 20D, 1DS Mark 2, the Nikon D70s, and D2Hs. So I do have some incredible cameras to compare my Maxxum 7D to. Even though the Maxxum 7D is not in the same league as the Canon 1DS ll or the Nikon D2Hs it does have a lot of features that come very close to these DSLR's at no where near the cost.<br /><br />My introduction to photography began with a Minolta XE-7 back in 1981 and I have been a loyal Minolta user ever since. They continue to quietly push technology. Minolta was the first camera to take pictures on a manned space flight, They were the first to indroduce TTL metering, They were the first to put color corrective coating on lenses, the first to create a body integrated auto-focus system, the first to put Aperature and Shutter Priority modes on a camera, and the list goes on. Now they can add the first Body Integrated Anti-Shake System with the Maxxum 7D.<br /><br />During the past year my Maxxum 7D has held up to shooting dog sled races, and sub-zero backcountry adventures, pounding rain, scorching sun, sand storms, weddings and family snapshots. Yes, there have been a few misfires but not different than any other camera on the market. It's electronic and all electronics hiccup every now and again no matter what company made them. The Nikon I used had to be sent back three times for repair and the Canon 20D had to be sent back twice. I also had to send the Maxxum 7D in once but the repair was the fastest I had seen from a camera manufacturer at 7 days. The reason for sending the Maxxum 7D in was because the auto focus motor would not disengage fully so I could manual focus. The problem was resolved and has worked awesome ever since.<br /><br />I love the nobs. I don't like haveing to run through a LCD menu to change settings like you have to do with Canon and Nikon so the Maxxum 7D suits me perfectly, but this is a personal choice and not of any relevence. I like how logical all the settings are. It can be as simple as you like or as confusing as you want to make it.<br /><br />Is this camera for everyone? Definitly not. I don't believe there is one camera that is capable of producing 100% of creative impulses that flash across my mind. Sometimes only film will work, some shots require medium format, other times just a simple pinhole camera is all I need. One thing I do know for sure is that the Maxxum 7D is one incredible camera with endless capabilities and at a fraction of the cost of $3000+ DSLR's. In fact the Maxxum 7D has bailed me out of many situations when the Nikon D2Hs, Canon 20D and 1DS Mark ll have failed to work properly. At not time has the Minolta ever failed to produce the results I expected. For this reason I give it a five star.<br /><br />Now that the Maxxum 5D has arrived I eagerly await the Maxxum 9D.","If you are looking for a semi-pro digital SLR that can take pictures of the family at Disney or in your professional studio, this is it. It won't break your budget, and you will be the \"Apple\" user of the DSLR prosumer market. (i.e., secretly envied by Canon and Nikon users, but most won't admit it!).<br /><br />This camera has some real positives over other manufacturer's cameras in the same class. First and foremost, it has 'anti-shake' built into the camera body. For those that don't know, this is similar to the \"steadycam\" technology used on consumer camcorders to help stabilize your shots. There is one big difference between Konica-Minolta's implementation and everyone else's on the market: you get anti-shake built into the body of the Maxxum 7D! What does this mean? It means virtually EVERY lense you buy is now anti-shake! Every other manufacturer makes you buy special lenses that have a similar feature built into the LENSE, not the BODY.<br /><br />YES, it really works to. A convenient little indicator inside the viewfinder tells you just how much anti-shake each shot is needing.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be great to quickly change almost any option on your DSLR camera and get back to shooting pictures without delay? Ever tried to change some feature, only to have to wade through two or three levels of menus on some small LCD? This is not only frustrating, but embarrasing! Imagine your wedding party not having to wait for you to make adjustments or you are at some sports event and the opportunity to take the picture is a one shot deal. No more! The Maxxum 7D has no top LCD. That's right...this is a positive- NO top LCD. Instead, almost every major function can be changed with a knob or button on the top or side of the camera. Yes, this presents a little bit of a learning curve. Yes, I was a little nervous about Konica-Minolta's choice to go this way in the design. I can tell you now, after less than a week of ownership, I love it!<br /><br />In addition, there are hundreds of lenses and accessories available for this camera, the body itself feels solid and comfortable, the 2\" LCD screen on the back is enormous compared to the competition, the camera can save in RAW and JPEG format AT THE SAME TIME, and for a DSLR, it is just plain fun to shoot with.<br /><br />The ONLY drawback I have found is that Konica-Minolta chose 6 megapixels for this model, while some of the competing models are at 8 megapixels. Honestly, if you know photography, the difference between 6 and 8 megapixels is really non-existent to 99% of those who would view your photos. If you are trying to decide between the Canon D20 and the Maxxum 7D for example, the anti-shake feature FAR outweighs any small benefit you could get from the additional megapixels on other models. (This camera's features really should be compared with camera's like the Canon D20, and not the entry level Canon Rebel XT line).<br /><br />One other feature no one seems to have mentioned is the built in Depth of Field Preview button. This is a really convenient feature that allows you to check and see your depth of field before taking the shot. (Depth of field is simply how much of the background is your picture is in focus. For example, a close up portrait might have the background out of focus while a shot of the mountains will have everything in focus).<br /><br />Overall, this camera will meet almost any level photographer's needs. Although the controls have a small learning curve, within less than an hour of shooting you will love them. Whether you have a lot of photography experience, or almost none at all, this is one digital SLR you should really consider.","Every day since I purchased this camera three weeks ago I have been outside or somewhere else getting shots of EVERYTHING.  The body design is FLAWLESS; every setting is virutally at your fingertips without having to sort through menus.  Even the menus that are in the camera are a breeze to sort through--they are all full screened, independent menus, you won't have to select a menu category and scroll up and down to find the option you're looking for.  Every essence of design in this camera is done in the name of ease.<br /><br />I purchased a Canon G6 back in January because of the features it offered: 7.1MP and a manually controlable, bright F/2.0 lens.  I had been shooting with a Minolta Maxxum 5 SLR for several years, but being in college, it was difficult to have the money and time to develop pictures, so I turned solely to digital--I was hoping the G6 would be the medium between the two at a moderate, one-time price.  I missed the features of an SLR, but the G6 was more like a point-and-shoot, not the SLR I was seeking.  Then came the 7D, and it has satiated every craving I have had to stifle for the benefits of an SLR.<br /><br />The pictures I have gotten out of this camera are AMAZING.  Friends have asked me where I bought the pictures on my wall, and when I tell them I took them and printed them myself, they are nothing short of amazed.  This is also a fantastic camera to learn SLR photography on.  You don't need to wait to get pictures back from the lab to realize what you were doing wrong--you can see everything clear as day on the 2.5\" LCD.  The autofocus system is out of this world, focusing quickly in even the darkest locations.<br /><br />My only gripe with the camera is the provided software does a lousy job maintaining detail in converting and handling the RAW images.  Use Photoshop's Camera RAW utility, it's much better.  And at times, the images you get out of the camera appear slightly soft, but I like that the camera isn't pushy like some other brands with in-camera sharpening.  If I want a sharper picture, I usually just boost the sharpening effect +1.  Overall, a DEFINITE GOOD BUY.","The ease of using the interface of this camera is beyond any other competitors. Almost all settings can be done with the dials, meaning to say that you don't have to sieve through tons of menus on the LCD to change a setting. The LCD is a big bonus as well. It really makes me wonder why Nikon and Canon can't do the same, it's not technically challenging nor does it increase cost by much. Trust me, you'll love the 7D once you compare it's LCD to the puny ones that others offer. Battery life is adequate as well. Obviously the Anti-shake is an advantage, especially if you have shakey hands to begin with. But take note that it's not a miracle cure, it REDUCES shake, but doesn't ALWAYS eliminate it. So at the end of the day, you still require rather steady hands.<br /><br />A few gripes. Firstly, there's not much lens selection. You can't beat the likes of canon's vast collection. But Minolta is rectifying that, so its not much of a problem. Second, focusing speed is not up to par with the canon 20D nor the nikon D70. If you're the kind who feels strongly about focusing speed, u might just get frustrated with this one.<br /><br />At the end of the day, minolta has designed one splendid camera, with a few shortcomings. But hey, nothing's perfect.","I'm a longstanding fan of Minolta and this model does not disappoint.  It is, however, immensly complicated so be prepared.<br /><br />A WARNING: Minolta always in past models included a memory card all be it a small one.  It is NOT included in this package and you must buy one (a 1 GB runs a bit less than $100 additional).  What a let down to unpack and set up the camera and not be able to use it until the next day after a trip to a local camera store.","I cannot express it better.  WOW, what a camera. I have moved up from the 7000i to the 7D. I bought the camera in mid Jan and to date have taken over 2000 pictures with it. Probaly 300+, just learning what things did what.<br /><br />I take pictures in 3(primarily) modes. The ability to set the camera in those 3 modes, and switch from one to the other is a tremendous plus to me. Most of my work is at night. Some times with flash, sometimes ambient light. Being able to rotate one dial to change the camera settings makes it easy and fool proof. As long as I remember to do it.<br /><br />Using continous, daylight, I can get a play back that is close to full motion video. From a still camera. I was getting 16-18 shots a second. Thanks to the large buffer.<br /><br />Down side? Well, compared to the 7000i I shot for 10 years or more, this camera is heavy, and though I was able to use my existing lens, thanks to the body mount stabilization, the 5600 flash is very expensive, and necessary for digital photography.<br /><br />Overall, I can't say enough good things about this camera. 8 mega pixel chip? I would need a wall mount TV, as a monitor for my computer.","I have just had my camera for a week so this review is very preliminary. First of all let me say me that I am a diehard dyed in the wool Minolta believer. So, this review won't be so much about what is right but more about things I found that perplexed me or need improvement. I am doing it that way because it has been my experience that most people that already have a top end camera are not looking to switch systems and that KM users reading reviews want to know where the weaknesses exist. I already own a Max9 and HtsiPlus so I was elated to see that the controls were left alone and are much the same as on the Max 9&7. The camera, as with the 9 & 7 is a very intuitive camera. Many people have complained about the weight but after using the 9 for so long the 7D feels like a feather. The big screen is really nice especially for me since I am over 50 and suffer the over 40 eye disease :-). The big screen makes scrolling through options an almost unannoying experience and is certainly easy to find what you want easily. Some of the symbols used in the menu are not very intuitive to me and I find myself hunting for which one to use for what I want to change. But I do appreciate how easy it is to read the screen. At first glance at the viewfinder it appears the camera has eyestart but it does not. Apparently the sensors are there to detect when to turn the screen off if you have it in always on mode. I never really used eystart anyway. The onboard flash seems to be too harsh for subjects within 7 to 10 feet range which is typically the range that a flash works best. I tried using the onboard flash in ADI (without and ADI lens, more on this later), pre-flash ttl, and manual mode. It didn't matter what mode I used, if I didn't dial in flash compensation the flash would be too harsh and if I dialed in compensation there wouldn't be enough flash. I guess the ttl doesn't work. Now for The ADI issue. I don't understand why there is an ADI option in the flash menu? Shouldn't ADI just work intuitively if the lens is ADI? Why do I have to turn it on or off? In fact, I would have loved to see a flash button put on the camera so I don't have to go to the menu to put the flash in manual or pre-flash ttl mode. Instead I'd just push the button then use the control wheel to set the flash mode.<br />Finally, if you purchase the VC-7D grip be warned that the holding strap (HS-1) does not come with the grip like it does with VC-9 grip. You have purchase it as a seperate item at about $21. Speaking of the grip, why doesn't the VC-7D hold two different kinds of batteries at the same time like the VC-9?<br /><br />After I take some pictures I'll be back to tell you what I think.<br /><br />10/22/06 Ok I am back. I have thoroughly enjoyed using this camera. Except for a trip I took to Sanibel Island Florida Ding Darling Refuge in April 06 I have used the Maxxum 7D exclusively. I have found that flash problem I spoke of earlier is caused by the hyperfocal distance of the lens. If you are shooting within 10 feet and not using an ADI capable lens you must have the flash set to TTL. Also, using the 5600hs(D) external flash with a lens 40mm or less you must dial down the flash to -1 or even -2. Battery life is excellent. I have filled up 3 1GB cards without having to change batteries. The anti-shake mechanism works but works much better with lenses of 200mm or better. I still haven't learned the menu system well enough to go straight to the function I wish change without having to think about it quite a bit. There is a neat custom function which allows you to select the center contoller button as the AF instead of using the shutter release button. this allows you to prefocus leaving the shutter release for setting exposure so that you can reframe and shoot without waiting for the lens to refocus.","I am a professional photographer and have shot Minolta since the advent of the first auto focus, the Model 7000. As the years went by, Cannon and Nikon seemed to kill them with lens selection and features. I still hung in there. I had about $11,000 in lenses alone and was more than a little pleased with the new Maxxum 9 when it came out. What a great camera! However, digital was rapidly becoming king.<br /><br />About the time I decided to chuck it all for a new Cannon digital system, I heard rumors of a Minolta digital. This was previously stated to NEVER happen. Minolta would not build a digital body. Thank God for Konica! Shortly after the purchase of Minolta by Konica, the probability of a digital was rumored. I decided to hold out and am glad I did.<br /><br />The camera is packed with an enormous array of features that can pretty much be found on most upper end Digital's. However, three main things have made me absolutely ecstatic with this camera:<br /><br />1. The image viewing screen is absolutely huge compared to others. I can actually do legitimate critical proofing with this thing. I don't think you could even fit a bigger screen on it without making the camera larger.<br /><br />2. The anti shake body is impressive...very impressive This is not new technology for Minolta. They have had this incorporated into their fixed lens digital for a while now. Bottom line is that it works! I sat it on the hood of a running car with the stabilizer on and then off (300mm 2.8 lens). The two photos were unbelievably different. One was blurred, one wasn't. That simple.<br /><br />3. It shoots the same way my Maxxum 9 does. When I turn it on, it is ready to shoot. No waiting. The buffer size allows me to shoot continuously without missing important photos while waiting for the camera to catch up to me. This is extremely nice and not what I am used to.<br /><br />When I heard of the possibility of this camera being introduced (more than a year before it actually finally hit the market) I purchased an Olympus E20 to get me by for the time. I have been very happy with the Olympus in the studio. However, the screen was too small to proof with and I was always waiting on the camera. It is now my back up. I LOVE this new Minolta and can't wait until they put their 8 meg chip in another model. Perhaps a 9D?<br /><br />Hmm I hope so.<br /><br />At any rate, I am impresed. I will now be purchasing another as my back up.<br /><br />Thank you very much, Konica/Minolta...Finally","If you have had minolta cameras before you will feel right at home with this new maxxum 7D (Dynax in europe). I have been a long time minolta user and was very glad to see this camera finally hitting the market. Just last week I finally got the chance to handle one at a local store. I am sharing my initial impression of the camera.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) Feels great in hand. I was very comfortable with its ergonomic design.<br /><br />2) The AS (Anti Shake) feature is truly useful. I have been reading posts from canon users as well as minolta 7d users and looks like the AS is coming really handy in low light situation. Canon and Nikon both have similar technology for reducing shake at low light or with high level zoom. However, those technologis are built into the lense. Because of that those lenses are more expensive than the regular lense. BUT Minolta has the AS built into the body. That's why any regular Minolta/maxxum AF lenses can be used and benefit from AS technology. That is the key difference and creates this initial price difference.<br /><br />3) Color is great right out of the camera. No retouching is necessary.<br /><br />4) Large buffer for continuous shooting<br /><br />5) Takse variety of preexisting minolta lenses<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) PRICE ! I think the price will scare away several would be amature photographers. Especially since a digital rebel (not as feature rich) can be found less than 1000$.<br /><br />Bottom line. If you already own minolta  lenses this maybe the right camera for you to leap into digital photography. Or else you may want to take a look at digital rebel and see if that fits your bills.","The Konica Minolta Maxxum 7D is a digital SLR (DSLR) which is built on Minolta's Maxxum 7 body in terms of buttons, knobs, and layout. In terms of build quality, it is more like the Maxxum 9 professional 35mm film body. It has an APS-size CCD as its image sensor which crops an image by 1.5X in comparison with its 35mm film counterpart. The 7D has a large, high-resolution LCD, matched by only two other DSLRs, as of this writing: the Nikon D2H and D2X, both of which are twice the price of this camera. It has a maximum ISO of 3200, matched by few other cameras. Even the Canon 1Ds has a maximum ISO of only 1250 and the Canon 1D Mark II of only 1600. The 7D has a resolution of 6 mega pixels, which some might find disappointing, given the plethora of new digital cameras which have come out over the past year having a resolution of 8 mega pixels. The big news, of course, is the built-in image stabilization, introduced in the Minolta A-1 prosumer camera. While Canon users, and, more recently and to a lesser degree, Nikon users, have had to choose a lens here and a lens there on which to spend their hard earned cash if they wanted image stabilization, owners of the 7D will pay a fair price for it once and will then gain the benefits of it with every lens in their arsenal; wide, long, macro, or special effect (e.g., soft focus). This is something that was impossible with film. It really is a brilliant idea.<br /><br />Although there are some caveats, this is an excellent digital SLR with great features, handling, and performance.

But here it goes...<br /><br />  The Optio MX was a camera that was ahead of it's time! We've had this camera for over 2 years now. Wanting a more compact camera with the current modern features such as image stableization and longer battery life, we bought a few other camera's since, Sony, Fuji, Canon, but we always went back to the Optio MX. The picture quality of the Optio MX is superior to all the other camera's that we purchased. The video with the Optio MX is also superior. One of the big problems with video is the low-light performance, but the Optio MX excells in this area, and makes video's that are excellent even in low-light. The unbelievable amount of features and manual controls make this camera a diamond in the rough.<br /><br />  It's too bad that Pentax abandoned this great camera. A few refinements would have made this camera perfect. The Optio MX is a few years old now - and that means it's almost an antique in the world of technology, but if you can find one of these beauties BUY IT! There is STILL nothing better out there than the Optio MX.","I've had my Pentax Optio MX4 for two years and I can't think of a single thing that I'd change.  I've used other digital cameras - HP and Sony - and this is by far the best point and shoot I've ever used. I take hundreds of shots every month and the picture quality is exception.","Have been using MX4 for 3 months now. I have a couple other digital cameras (Kodak and Canon) . The MX4 has the most features.  Several thing I especially like:  10x optical zoom, 0mm close-up, manual aperture/shutter support, movable LCD screen.<br /><br />Cons:  MPEG4 video is not smooth and the autofocus is slow.  The video format is Quicktime.  I wish it uses Divx format, so I can play the videos on Divx DVD players (e.g. Philips 642).  In program mode, the photo is a little dark.  With the flash, the photos are too bright and some times over-exposed.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with my purchase.  It's the best digital camera you can get for under $300.","I bought this recently because of the good reviews on here so far and I must say I'm not disappointed. It looked quite big when I viewed the picture but trust me this baby is so tiny and looks really cute. It's very easy to use and much better if you buy a lets say 1GB SD card since you can record longer, obviously and take more pics but like the previous reviewer said, you can by a multimedia storage and store them in it if you're on holiday.<br /><br />The quality of the images are very good and the video cam isn't too bad either. You can play around with the quality and obviously the lesser quality the more you can store in the SD.<br /><br />Only thing I have to say is that if you are looking for a cam corder more than a digital than this isn't your best option and vice versa for Digital cam as there are so many now and some better in quality but this baby is great and has both in one package so it's like best of both worlds.","I bought this camera a month ago and it really serve its purpose. with a camera like this, what more can u ask for? it has a 10x optical zoom and a 10x digital zoom which u can adjust and a digital camera & video camra in one! this is my first digital camera and i think i really made a good deal buying this.","I bought one, a few days ago. I'm loved.","I HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT CAMERAS INCLUDING THE SANYO-FISHER CAMERACORDER FVD-C1 WHICH COSTS $750 BUT THIS MX4 TAKES VIDEO JUST AS GOOD @ 640X480 WITH 30 FPS AND EVEN BETTER PICS @ 4MP COMPARED TO 3.2 ON THE FISHER! AND I PAID LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE! THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST VALUE DIGITAL STILL/VIDEO CAMERA ON THE MARKET, THE VIDEO LOOKS ALMOST AS GOOD AS MINI DV AND THE STILLS ARE ALMOST AS GOOD AS MY MINOLTA DIMAGE 7i, ALL I CAN SAY IS YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS CAMERA FOR UNDER $300 !","Very happy with this item .... small and light weight easy to carry around .....Thank You","Great","Very pleased with the quality, value, and service. I received a quality<br />product with extras, cheaper, and faster shipping then previously experienced on ebay. I'm sold on Amazon.com for its quality of sellers, and will definately purchase from this seller again without hesitation.

I don't know of another digital camera with all the features it has such as 4mp,10x optical (100x digital),640x480 MPEG-4 Movie at 30 fps with sound that plays directly on TV from the camera ,1.8\" swiveling LCD,ergonomic rotating grip,PictBridge etc. It take just a few minutes to load the MP4 video on the computer and view it with Quicktime then burn it on CD's or DVD's to share it with family and friends. It has 10 picture modes along with program,shutter-priority,aperture-priority,metered manual,voice recording and eight digital filters. I use a tripod with fluid head when using the zoom lens at 10x for rock steady images or videos. When on vacation you can combine the still images with videos on the same SD memory card. I just ordered the Epson P-2000 multimedia storage and viewing device that has a 40GB HD and 3.8\" LCD to download the SD cards so you can shoot all the photo and video you want on vacation without having to worry about running out of storage. And the best thing about the Pentax MX4 is the price that is less than half what I paid for my 3mp Epson 3100Z in 2001."]},{"name":"Pentax Optio SV","amazon_reviews":["Good item","Great camera at a really great price. Can't figure why Pentax stopped making it. It's one of, if not the only, really small pocket cameras with a 5X zoom and 5 mega pixels is plenty for the average photos.","Bought it for my daughter - she's very happy!","This camera takes amazing pictures. It has a ton of functionality, which I have not figued out yet. It will take some time, but it will be worth it.","This little 5MP camera takes beautiful pictures, has advanced features and is reasonably priced.","I bought this camera to replace an original Optio-S (which has really been great), hoping to use the extra zoom to get better shots of a graduation ceremony.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the box I was a bit disappointed by the relative heft. It is about twice the bulk of the earlier model and certainly no longer able to fit comfortably in a pants pocket much less in a mint tin. Anyway, I guess it's understandable as the extra zoom length has to create some size disadvantage.<br /><br />However, the real zinger here is the shutter lag. It takes as long as 3 seconds to get a shot off after pressing the shutter release, and this with fresh batteries and a high speed (Ultra II) memory card. Not only does that render the camera unreliable, but its primary asset, namely the 5X zoom, becomes a liability as it accentuates any hand movement that might occur during the lag and therefore makes for a lot of blurry images.<br /><br />I wound up leaving the SV at home and buying a new Canon SD400 which did great service and is now my favorite digital.","The new Optio SV differentiates itself from other slim-profile digital cameras by offering a whopping 5x optical zoom!  This is just amazing achievement on the part of Pentax, being able to outgun all competition in this important area.  The SV is comparable in width and height to the popular Canon SD300 and SD400 models, but is about 1/3 thicker.  It takes good-quality pictures.  Not quite as great as the Canon models or even the Casio EX-Z55/Z57, but still very acceptable both for screen display and for print.<br /><br />But the SV suffers from two problems that may limit its appeal.  Let me first say that these are not \"fatal\" problems.  For *your* needs, you may find the pros of this super-zoom camera more than offset the two problems, so by all means if this fits your needs, go for it.  I really, really like the 5x zoom, period.<br /><br />The two problems are:<br /><br />1) Shutter lag.  All digital cameras have shutter lag (the time between you press the shutter button and when the picture is actually taken), but this one is a bit longer than its competition.  It also takes longer time than many competitors (Canon, Casio, Nikon, Sony) to write an exposed image to memory.  This results in a shot-to-shot time that was normal two years ago but is considered on the long side this day and age.<br /><br />2) Battery life.  This is where I've got a serious beef, as the rechargeable battery packs enough power for only 80 or so pictures.  The Canon SD300, in comparison, can do about 200 pictures per charge and the Casio EX-Z55/57 can do 350 or more.  With the Pentax Optio SV, you have to either buy 2 spare batteries or pack the charger with you wherever you go.<br /><br />If Pentax could improve battery life and shutter lag, this would be the ultracompact digicam of my choice.","I've had SLRs for years and know enough to want and use the manual aspects of such cameras for the unique pictures you can capture once in a while.  I wanted the same capabilities in my first digital camera. But I also wanted convenience, compact size, and a reasonable telephoto lens. Quite simply, this camera has it all. Its fully automated, night-time, and sunset modes take the most stunning pictures with a simple push of the button (get a mini tripod for the night and sunset pics). The panorama and movie mode (with sound) makes my SLR obsolete. I bought an extra battery but with charging each night, I never needed it on vacation. I bought a 1gig memory card and after 9 days on vacation, 181 pictures at full resolution, and 2 minutes of movie, it still had room for over 600 more pictures (i.e., 1 gig was not neccessary). The only disappointment is that there is a delay while taking and after taking a picture. The 5x optical zoom adds more calculation time to the auto focus and there is another small delay while it writes each picture to memory (SLR users will find this delay frustrating but I got used to it quickly). I believe this is still the smallest 5x optical zoom on the market. It's a bit pricey, but if you can afford it, you get it all in one compact camera.","Good item","Great camera at a really great price. Can't figure why Pentax stopped making it.

I have heard good results with that split center microprism focusing screen as it allows you to manually focus better like the good old SLR days.<br /><br />The autofocus motor is a little slower than the competition, but it is highly accurate and offers eleven focus points to chose from. For most general purposes it is fast enough. The thing about Pentax is that it is not the best with one particular feature (except lense quality) but it can do everything very well. This makes it overal VERY good.<br /><br />The optical quality of Pentax lenses is as good if not better than the competition and at a lower price, perhaps from the lower demand from consumers. Nonetheless, even the kit lense blows away the competition.<br /><br />Noise level is not a factor, and in my opinion is controlled better than Canons and Nikons giving more of a resemblance to real film grain. Although, it is still much more usable at ISO 3200 than film cameras are.<br /><br />If you love to take pictures then get into Pentax. If you would rather have the most advanced technology and have the camera take the pictures for you, then look elsewhere but consider that Pentax will be soon coming out with possibly image stabilization integrated in a new 10 megapixel pro spec body, and an 18 megapixel medium format sensor camera at the end of 2006.<br /><br />The only downside at this point is that desirable Pentax lenses can be difficult to find, but they are coming out with some new models soon also.","I am a long time Pentax user since the days of the Asahi body with screw mount lens and no light meter.  I've been buying Pentax cameras almost every 10 years including Pentax-made HP point-and-shoot digital cameras .  Been waiting a while for Pentax to come through with an affordable dSLR in my price range and with the right features.  The time has finally come with the *istDS since Pentax is phasing them out and replacing it with *ist DS2 and *ist DL.<br /><br />When I compared the DS with DS2 and DL, I just could not see my self spending more money on DS2 for very little feature changes.  By the same token, I wasn't too crazy on the reduction of features on the DL especially the replacement of Pentaprism with mirrors. So the DS is the best choice for the money at this time.<br /><br />After using my *ist DS for a few weeks, I really fell in love with the camera as it rekindle my joy for photography. But there are a couple of things I wanted to mention to potential buyers who are considering this camera.<br /><br />1. The Pentax DA 18-55mm lens is almost useless for general situations.  It goes from wide to normal view only.  I would have preferred something like the Tamron 18-200 mm XR Di II lens that allows me to go from wide to normal to zoom.<br /><br />2. The built-in flash is weak and the pictures look cold and blue.  My point and shoot digital camera took better flash pictures then the *ist-DS.  Using my old Pentax TTL flash on the camera was a real improvement esp. with bounce flash.<br /><br />3. For the guys who want to use old Pentax lens and flash with this camera, that will only last for a short time until you consider how much lighter and smaller the new Auto-Focus lens that are available for the dSLRs.  Also, the newer P-TTL flashes works in conjuction with zoom level of your lens and can control slave flashes wirelessly.<br /><br />4. The Pentax *ist-DS camera case (O-CC28) is the perfect complement to the camera since it contains a pocket for the IR remote and lens cap.  However, you can not find them anywhere in the U.S..  The *ist-D case (O-CC10) does not fit the *ist-DS body.<br /><br />5. I was able to use the IR remote from my Pentax-made HP point and shoot.  This leads me to believe that any Pentax IR remote should be compatible with the *ist-DS camera.  There's a bunch of them out there on Ebay.  Pentax should include this with the camera as a freebie like all the point-and-shoot cameras.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars because some of the idiosynchrocies I mentioned above.","Pentax - name associated with quality photography. This lightweight, easy to use - great quaility build DSLR is a fantastic choice for anyone that is thinking about upgrading from 35mm or just starting out in digital photography- easy menu functions and backward compatable interchangeable lenses.. I reccommend a 1gig Ultra II SD card - for maximum storage and I highly advise rechargeable batteries.","Owning a Pentax SFX SLR with multiple zoom lens, fixed lens, Super Flash, filters and various additional attachments, going to the *ist was a no brainer. Now I can travel with the best of both worlds and use much of the fine equipment collected over the years. I can say the 'old' film camera lens and flash works with the 'new' digital camera with nary a hitch. I can carry a single battery source for both cameras. Photos come out as expected. Pentax steady preditable quality continues.","Being a Pentax fan from the SF-10 film days, I was delighted to see the Pentax *ist DS body at an affordable price.  Being into recycling from the early 70's, I was thrilled to be able to use  my Pentax 28-80 and 70-210 lenses, as well as my flash attachments and remote control.  Going from film to digital, the old lenses actually convert to about 45-100 and about 125-310.  Only sacrifice is a smaller wide angle, but makes up in the closeups!<br /><br />Easy to use both in automatic and manual modes, good color and depth of field.  For both the newbie and advanced phototgrapher, this camera offers it all.  Only 1 disadvantage would be the size if you are used to a small pocket digital camera - peronally, I love the size and balance.<br /><br />First photo (uploaded on this site) is of a hummingbird and a honeybee making a beeline for the hummer!  Amazed the camera caught the split second action!<br /><br />Other reviews go into detail on the specs - I just simply love this camera!","I am by no means a professional photographer but based on the several reviews I read on the web I purchased this camera.  Pentax is a great company with a long history in the camera business and continue to release great products.  I found this camera to be very user friendly and I am still learning what it is capable of doing.","This is a very very good camera for anyone considering a digital SLR.  Especially considering the price.  If you already own Pentax lenses, this should be an easy decision.<br /><br />This is my first digital SLR.  I've had Pentax and Sony digital point-and-shoot type cameras and Nikon Coolpix 8700.  Also, I've been using Pentax SLRs for past 20 years.<br /><br />Others have already detailed many reasons to buy this camera and dpreview has done a good job comparing the image qualities, but I should highlight the following advantages of ist DS:<br /><br />1.  Flexible power source.  ist DS can use AA batteries.  I use NiMH rechargeable AA batteries ... about $10 for 4 of them compared to $50 for proprietary batteries for Canon or Nikon SLRs.  But the fact that the camera can use AA batteries is great when I'm traveling.  Also, the fact that external flash light uses AA batteries make it easy in that you only need to worry about one type of batteries.<br /><br />2.  Sturdy and compact design.  The camera simply feels solid in my hands.<br /><br />3.  Good image quality.  Some have said and documented that the JPEG image isn't as good as Nikon or Canon because of the weap processing power within the camera.  BUT, if that's the concern, shoot in RAW format and use your computer to process the images.  If you are the type that don't want to bother with doing that much work, you probably won't notice the difference in JPEG image between ist DS and Nikons or Canons anyway.<br /><br />4.  Easy controls.  Controls are intuitive and easy to access/learn.  You won't need a manual to learn the controls.  (In contrast, Nikon Coolpix 8700's controls were simply difficult.  Really needed the manual for the camera.)<br /><br />5.  SD card rather than using Compact Flash card.  I like it because SD card is much more compact and easy to move it from the camera to the computer ... any computers.<br /><br />The 18-55 mm kit lens is worth it for the price.  If you buy a package, the price of the lens comes out to be under $100.  I think Pentax is planning on introducing 12~24 mm lens in about a year.","As an enthusiastic early adopter of digital photography, there were simply some aspects of SLR photography that I missed, especially for situations when I wanted specific control of exposure or focus via shutter speed or aperature size. This camera is loaded with functionality and features that return such control, yet most of its functions can be learned in one sitting with its fantastically written user manual.<br /><br />If you are an old-school SLR shooter who wants to return to mastery of composition through control of aperature or shutter speed, this will get the job done.. It also offers typical autofocus/auto exposure/autoflash when you are just making snapshots.<br /><br />It's surprisingly lighweight. The controls and data information displays/interface are extremely user freindly. Some retailers are offering an additional aftermarket 70-300mm zoom lens in a bundle. Whether you purchase through them or this single lens offering via Amazon, you'll be doing high quality digital SLR shooting for about the cost of other DSLR bodies alone.<br /><br />The included software has some terrific features, including dual monitor support for slideshows. For the serious amateur or professional looking for a cost effective \"working\" tool...this is a great deal.","I just bought mine this afternoon, since then I have been fooling around with it, it is terrific.<br /><br />Photos are just beautiful, color superb and very sharp.  Manual is pretty good, its seems to be very intuitive.<br /><br />In my search for a decent digital camera, I've been thru a Nikon D70, the camera refused to give correctly exposed photos, no matter what I did, added or subtracted exposures, changed speed ratings, white balance, name it , I did it, still did not work properly, finally ended up returning it.<br /><br />I then bought the new Canon Rebel Digital, I knew that when I bought it, it would be trouble it was,flash did not work, camera also appeared to be shabbily made.<br /><br />Returned that, bought the Minolta Konica A200, this was the worst of the bunch, never could get sharp pictures, color was wishy washy, exposures so so, at 200 mm setting the photos were not as good as a disposable camera.<br /><br />Today after returning the Minolta, I bought the Pentax, runs complete circles around, Nikon, Minolta and Canon, just superb.<br /><br />I hope it never fails, if I return that one, I am afraid of the consequences in the store, they have been great so far, just great.<br /><br />I printed out some photos and they were the best I have ever seen.<br /><br />Great Job Pentax, I hope they stay around, just saw in financial columns on line they have laid off 300 people due to sagging digital sales.<br /><br />They have always made great products, I hope they make it, I am sure they will.<br /><br />If you want a great digital slr, go for the pentax, you cannot go wrong.<br /><br />Now, I think its time to go thru the manual in detail.","I've had this camera about 4 months now, and I'm more satisfied than ever that I chose this over the Canon (20D) and Nikon (D70) that I tried for several days each.<br /><br />First I didn't even consider the Canon Rebel (other than picking it up for a few moments at the store).  The Rebel is cheaply built plastic, and feels like toy.  I'm sure it's more durable than it feels, but if I had bought the Rebel, I would have regretted it every time I picked it up.  Plus, why would you buy one when the Pentax is available for about the same price, and the Pentax feels much more like a professional camera should.<br /><br />I tried the Canon 20D and Nikon D70 for several days each before deciding to buy the Pentax.  First on the D20, there is no doubt that it is a better camera than the Pentax or the Nikon in several ways.  First SPEED.  The D20 is by far the fastest camera of the 3, and will take something over 5 frames per second I believe.  It focused very fast, and had very little noise, even at high ISOs.  However it is at least $600 more than the the Pentax or the Nikon, and I decided the extra fps speed was not worth it for what I need a camera for.  The Pentax is no slouch at 2.4 fps, and I've found that to be as fast as I need.<br /><br />Compared to the Nikon D70, both cameras take good pictures (the should, they both use the same 6.1mp Sony sensor), but I like several things about the Pentax better.  1st, the Pentax is a MUCH smaller camera, and I really didn't like the behemoth size of the Nikon.  If you've never held the Nikon, be sure to go to a store and try it first.  You won't believe how huge it is.  2nd, The LCD screen on the Pentax is bigger and brighter.  3rd the viewfinder on the Pentax is a pentaprism, which gives you a much larger and brighter image than the pentamirror (cheaper) on the Nikon.  4th, I like the menu system much better on the Pentax (much more intuitive). And finally, I like the fact that the Pentax uses SD memory as opposed to compact flash memory,  and it uses AA batteries (rechargeable) as opposed to a proprietary battery.<br /><br />Try the Pentax *ist DS, you will LOVE this camera.","This camera is a perfect choice for people who sincerely want a REAL camera.  Nikon D70 is another one if you don't mind its bulkier size.<br /><br />With this Pentax, you will get not only absolutely-beautifully-textured black metal body as Nikon but also a very big and very clear penta-prism (not mirror as in others) viewfinder.  Plus, you can always pop into a gas station to get four AA batteries in a pinch.  Its pictures in JPEG might not be as sharp as ones from Rebel.  What's the heck? For family photos, I use zoom lenses and don't even shoot in the best quality JPEG anyway.  If I really care about the image quality, I can always put on my 50mm and shoot in RAW, whose quality is as good as Rebel.<br /><br />Canon Rebel and XT are really plastic toys that happen to be able to take very good pictures.  Even my son's Nintendo GB feels more substantial than a Rebel!  Unlike an owner of Rebel, whenever you see a real camera from the same manufacturer, such as Rebel's bigger brothers, you won't curse yourself for being a few hundred bucks short and treated as a second-class customer by the manufacturer.<br /><br />Maybe I have been too harsh on Canon.  I guess the concept behind Rebels is not really camera per se.  They mean not to be really a serious photographic tool, rather another piece of consumer electronics---in fashion and easily disposable.  If consumers are going to buy into their next generation next year, what's a point to make it to last?  I must say Canon did a truly very laudable job to execute this concept.","My first three digital cameras were Canon.  I still own a Canon G3, but when the ist DS came out I was interested.<br /><br />I did my research on the Canon Rebel and the Nikon D70 and the Pentax and after all was said and done I chose the Pentax!  I am very happy with the camera.<br /><br />It is much smaller size than the others and seems very solid.  Pentax lenses are also cheaper than similar Canon and Nikon lenses (You are paying for their marketing efforts).  Also Pentax lenses from 30 years ago can be used with this camera.<br /><br />Pictures thus far are excellent and I work with it each day.  I enter many photo contests and this camera holds it own!","Introduction<br /><br /> As an advanced hobby photographer, I often compete in galleries in my area.  I normally shoot with 35mm and medium format, and I scan the negatives and edit them in Photoshop CS.  I hesitantly took the plunge into the world of digital SLRs several months ago, and the *ist ds exceeded my expectations.  Like any camera, you will need to learn how to get good photographs out of it; it won't take them on its own.  I print everything on the i9900 Canon large format printer.  The following review should help decide if this camera is for you:<br /><br />Size and Weight<br /><br /> The most noticeable advantage of the Pentax is its size and weight.  I don't have small hands, but the competition makes them too bulky and heavy (some may disagree), sometimes with buttons out of reach.  You can program the buttons on digital SLRs to do different things, but only the ds has the buttons within reach to be useful when shooting.  For instance, the \"ok\" button can be pressed to temporarily switch to manual focus.  Many people with other digital SLRs buy a separate smaller digital camera to use normally, which in my opinion, defeats the purpose of buying the SLR, since you'll end up almost never using it.  But the Pentax is small and light enough to carry around normally, such as to a party or on vacation, especially now that they created the super slim 40mm lens that weighs next to nothing.<br /><br />Outdoor Picture Quality and RAW format<br /><br /> For artistic shots, I always use the RAW format, which Adobe recently updated for the RAW plugin.  Blowing up these shots to 13x19, I have found them to be quite sharp and clear.  Keep in mind that I have read several books in Photoshop, and like in the darkroom, it takes skill to get quality prints out of any media.<br /><br /> I mostly shoot outdoors, and have been impressed at how balanced shots come out in harsh lighting.  Even if the sky is partially blasted out, the highlight/shadow option in Photoshop brings them right back in, with virtually no loss in detail in the clouds.  Realize that this is not the case with the 8-bit JPEG format, which doesn't blow up nearly as well.  For quality prints, you'll need to use the RAW mode, which maintains the sharpness and color detail.<br /><br /> The biggest picture difference in other SLR's and the DS is that Pentax calibrated the camera to interpret with a more neutral color balance.  Some may feel disappointed by this, but from an advanced editing perspective, this is a blessing.  It allows me to have total control over the photo.  If the camera has oversaturated an area from the beginning, and you need to do an adjustment, there may be a lack of detail in that area afterward.  The Pentax appears much more natural looking, and with minimal adjustments from the Adobe RAW plugin, you can easily make the photos look exactly how you want.  With my Canon i9900 printer, which tends to print vivid photos, the combination produces realistic, vivid photos, not oversaturated and cartooning images.<br /><br /> Even objects far away and in deep shadow areas have been quite clear and detailed, and overall, I have been extremely satisfied with the picture quality.  When blowing up photos to 13x19, make sure to use \"bicubic smoother\" when increasing the resolution size.  I have found that this completely eliminates any type of stairstepping that may occur.  I had the opportunity to compare with a friend 8mp Canon SLR, and found no difference in sharpness of the image.  I also found there was less noise in my camera (we both took them side by side of the same landscape).<br /><br />Indoor Photography<br /><br /> I have only done this in personal situations combined with the 360 FGZ flash, which is a fantastic unit.  The bounce flash works perfect automatically, with uniform and realistic lighting.  Red eye has also not been a problem.  The built in flash, like with most SLRs, is just a backup, and works O.K.<br /><br /> Unlike the *ist d, the *ist ds doesn't connect directly to the wireless flash units.  If you have a wireless flash unit like the 360 FGZ, however, it will connect to other wireless flash units.  I have not had the chance to test this out myself.<br /><br />Portrait Photography<br /><br /> Flesh tones are realistic and pleasing, and hair maintains detail when enlarged.  This of course, depends on the lens used, but most results have been surprising pleasing, especially compared with 35mm color and medium format color film.  I still, however, prefer B+W film for portraits, but when I shoot in color, I have come to prefer the digital. Against harshly lit backgrounds, shots have come out surprising evenly lit and vibrant.<br /><br />Night Photography<br /><br /> Long exposures, also during the day, come out quite sharp, especially after the new firmware update that corrects some issues with night shots.  The camera is well programmed to handle night photography, and it usually is close to the correct exposure.  The camera also has the ability to lock up the mirror 2 seconds before the exposure to minimize camera shake.<br /><br />Focusing<br /><br /> The actual rotating speed is slower than my 35mm SLR, but this camera is more deliberate and actually gets to the correct focusing spot faster.  Red dots inside blink to show where the lens is focused.  The 16 segment metering is impressive, and I have found myself rarely using the manual focus option.  Even when shooting birds in trees, the focusing system doesn't get distracted by the braches.<br /><br /> In action mode, the camera switches to a continuous focusing system, which has been very reliable for action shots, such as sports or when people are walking toward you.  This feature only works in action mode, however.<br /><br />Custom Settings and Ease of Use<br /><br />You can program the buttons to do extra functions while in shooting mode.  For instance, the OK button can be used to temporary switch off the autofocus or to use center metering.  Make sure to go through the easy to read manual and the custom settings menu, since you will find some important features, such as changing the color to Adobe RGB instead of sRGB.<br /><br /> Nothing is \"hidden\" on the camera, and everything is easy to use and quick to locate.  The well written manual is worth reading front to back, and gives useful information.  The custom features require some knowledge of how you like your camera to operate, and others require light technical knowledge.  Both beginners and advanced users will be satisfied with features and ease of use.<br /><br />The SD Chip and Camera Performance<br /><br /> Make sure to buy a 60x chip, like the ATP which I have, or the SanDisk Ultra II.  I have tested the cheaper media, and they slow down the camera so that when the buffer runs out, instead taking 1.5 frames (I'm guessing) per second, its taking about 1 every 3 seconds.  The 60x chips really aren't that much more.  The SD chips aren't made quite as large and are more expensive than CP, but it contributes to making the camera smaller.<br /><br /> The buffer is comparable to the competition, with almost 3 frames per second until it reaches about 8 or 9 and then slows down about half way.  In RAW mode, it will start slowing down at about 5 or 6 frames.  I have never had a problem where it didn't take the picture when I wanted it to.<br /><br />The Optional Included Lens<br /><br /> For another $100, it is a useful lens, especially for personal shots in small rooms, where you'll need a wide angle zoom lens (and when you don't want to risk damaging a really expensive lens).  Its fairly light and compact.<br /><br />There is also a slim 40mm lens coming out soon, make sure to check it out on amazon.  Maybe you'll want to get this one instead, since other people will feel more at ease taking a picture for you.<br /><br />Batteries<br /><br /> The camera used four AAs or two CR-V3.  I prefer this over a propriety battery, since when the battery dies, you can't just pop by Wal-Mart and buy more.  Also, with newer NiMH rechargeable AA's, you can buy batteries just as good, and use the same batteries as in your hotshoe flash.  With lithium AAs and CR-V3s, you can take over 400 pictures before the batteries die out, making it nearly impossible to have dead batteries on vacation.  And if you did, you can just pop by anywhere and get more.  I have not yet had a situation where my 2500mah rechargeables died on me.  I have heard that CR-V3 batteries fit rather tight into the compartment, but have not had this problem myself.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br /> Overall, I've found the *ist ds quite impressive.  Even if you don't already have a collection of Pentax lenses, you'll find this camera to be a good alternative to the competition, with excellent build quality, easy of use, light weight, and compactness.  A large line of Pentax lenses will also impress you, but that is another discussion.  Although this hasn't replaced my other cameras, it has replaced my use of 35mm color film, since it's far sharper, with better color and detail.<br /><br /> Like any other camera, it will take some time to learn how to get the best pictures possible out of it.  However, even beginners will find that quality results are easily possible.  Good luck camera hunting!"]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-V3","amazon_reviews":["great camera","Because of its being only 7+ MP (larger pixels), it has great image quality when shooting infrared.  All you need to do is get the filter adapter, add a ND8 filter and a red 25 or 29 filter (I prefer 29) and shoot in nightshot mode.  Sure, you are limited to 1/30 at f2.8, but the images are fabulous when you are shooting RAW, but you still have the +-2 EV function to change exposures. In ISO 100 the shots are super clear if you hold it steady or use a tripod and 1/30 is no problem for me to handhold. Lightroom does a great job processing the RAW files from this camera, and photoshop gives you the color channel conversions. For the money, (used camera, used filters) it is the least expensive way to get into hand held high quality IR work!","I've had this beauty since December 2005 and amidst all the hoopla over newer and better(?) cameras, I still say that this Sony V3 is just about one of the best I've ever used and I've gone through a wide range from the  (also classic) Minolta SRT-101 to the Nikon F3 to the new DSLRs like the Nikon D60.<br /><br />So unassuming and yet, packed with capabilities only DSLRs have, this pro-sumer V3 allows me to exploit full manual capabilities that you wouldn't normally use if you were just a hobby shooter. It even beats some DSLRs with fast continuous shooting or bracketing or good low-light capabilities.<br /><br />I've only one limitation to this camera: its flash (but then again, camera-mounted flashes, even for DSLRs, are usually very weak and practically not recommended for natural-looking lighting in your photos, which I've countered by getting the Sony HVLF32X).<br /><br />I wish that Sony did not stop production of this legendary camera but rather built on it, especially for the accessories. If anyone from Sony is listening, PLEASE KEEP THE V3 ALIVE! I think, in fact, I'll be the first to form the SONY V3 ENTHUSIASTS CLUB OF THE PHILIPPINES.","Can there truly be a classic among digital cameras?  Technology moves so quickly that one year, let alone five, is an eternity.  And yet, try to take a Fuji F30 or F31 away from its owner and you'll get the Charlton Heston NRA line (from my cold dead hands)!  In time, I may have the same feelings for the Sony DSCV-3.<br /><br />I was lucky to get one of these (thanks Stefan B!) in as close to new condition as you can imagine a 5 year old camera to be.  It's construction is tank-like, considering it's not shockproof. It won't fit in your pants pocket, but a small pouch will do nicely.  By today's standards, it's not very wide at that end, and the start up time is slow.  But the focusing is lightning fast.  Sony's holograph AF emitter is as good as you've heard.  This is easily the best low light focusing camera I have.<br /><br />You may have heard about the softness at f8 phenomenon.  It's true.  I'm going to use this camera primarily in aperture priority or manual, and stay clear of the scene modes.  Understand this, and have fun with it!  I want a viewfinder in addition to the LCD, which is why I don't have an LX3.  I also feel that the megapixel wars have ruined some good ideas (Canon G10 anyone?)in cameras, so here's hoping I can stretch this beauty for a long time.  Perhaps Sony will look at the success of the G10 and the LX3 and bring back the V-series to compete.","How could you offer to sell this camera for $999.00 on December, 2008, when I bought this very same camera during the summer of 2005 for $299.00 from Beach Camera in New Jersey?  I also bought the flash from Amazon for less than 60 dollars.  Unless this camera has become a collector's item, I don't see any reason for its price to have tripled since 2005, given that there are newer models, and many Digital SLR's for lower prices.","After 3 years of backpacking in South America, Central America and the Rocky Mountains (plus some urban tourism also) and ~15,000 great pictures taken in 14 countries, our DSCV3 is still going strong.  Heat and humidity in jungles and subzero temperatures at several summits up to 18,000 feet haven't kept it from taking pro-quality shots.  I love its numerous features like similar SLRs, but without the bulk, plus the video and night-shot capabilities that SLRs don't have.  Because of it's size, I carry the camera discreetly in one pocket and the zoom and wide-angle lenses on the other, and can go into crowded markets without fear of getting mugged.  About 8,000 pictures ago, it went into a river in the Ecuador jungle and the Sony dealer in Quito serviced it and it was as good as new.","I bought my V3 in February of 2005 so this is a long term report.  I've shot at least 5000 photos with it over the years and I'm still happy with it and it hasn't broke or gave me trouble.  I came to this from years of using a Canon F1 and EF.  Outside of the cool factor, I can't say I miss my old film cameras.  Don't miss the weight on my neck either.<br /><br />Just ordered the Sony HVL-F32X flash unit for this since I have confidence that I'm not ready to move on to another camera until I forced to by circumstance.  Hope I don't drop it ;)<br /><br />Wes<br /><br />Not so happy now (2012).  I learned a few months ago that the shutter button has a habit of breaking off.  On a fairly expensive camera, a tiny piece of under engineered plastic that is critical failing is not acceptable.  Lowered rating from 5 to 3  It was a great camera for its time.","It seems like compact digital cameras are being phased out at hyper-speed these days as each model is quickly supplanted by the next generation.  These new cameras usually boast a boost in megapixels and zoom range, but those who look beyond the marketing mayhem are aware that more is not necessarily better.<br /><br />Meanwhile, my V3 still holds its own three years after I purchased it.  I've looked carefully at the current crop of compact digital cameras out now, and I've come to the conclusion that none are worthy of replacing my V3, though I expect that day will come eventually.<br /><br />In general, I am very happy with the features, performance, image quality, and reliability.  There are only two things I wish this camera had:<br /><br />*A wider angle lens (at least down to 28mm equiv.)<br />*Image stabilization (or better yet, a wider aperture)<br /><br />I realize it is possible to address both these issues on the V3: by attaching a wide angle conversion lens for the former, and by putting the camera on a tripod for the latter.  But it would be nice if these features were included as standard capabilities.  If they had been, this camera would have been a home run.  As it is, I still give the V3 4 stars...even by today's standards.","1.  I know it really doesn't make much sense to write a review on a camera that has been discontinued for many years, but I just wanted to document that this camera is still one of the best cameras I've ever owned / used.

All you need to do is get the filter adapter, add a ND8 filter and a red 25 or 29 filter (I prefer 29) and shoot in nightshot mode.  Sure, you are limited to 1/30 at f2.8, but the images are fabulous when you are shooting RAW, but you still have the +-2 EV function to change exposures. In ISO 100 the shots are super clear if you hold it steady or use a tripod and 1/30 is no problem for me to handhold. Lightroom does a great job processing the RAW files from this camera, and photoshop gives you the color channel conversions. For the money, (used camera, used filters) it is the least expensive way to get into hand held high quality IR work!","I've had this beauty since December 2005 and amidst all the hoopla over newer and better(?) cameras, I still say that this Sony V3 is just about one of the best I've ever used and I've gone through a wide range from the  (also classic) Minolta SRT-101 to the Nikon F3 to the new DSLRs like the Nikon D60.<br /><br />So unassuming and yet, packed with capabilities only DSLRs have, this pro-sumer V3 allows me to exploit full manual capabilities that you wouldn't normally use if you were just a hobby shooter. It even beats some DSLRs with fast continuous shooting or bracketing or good low-light capabilities.<br /><br />I've only one limitation to this camera: its flash (but then again, camera-mounted flashes, even for DSLRs, are usually very weak and practically not recommended for natural-looking lighting in your photos, which I've countered by getting the Sony HVLF32X).<br /><br />I wish that Sony did not stop production of this legendary camera but rather built on it, especially for the accessories. If anyone from Sony is listening, PLEASE KEEP THE V3 ALIVE! I think, in fact, I'll be the first to form the SONY V3 ENTHUSIASTS CLUB OF THE PHILIPPINES.","Can there truly be a classic among digital cameras?  Technology moves so quickly that one year, let alone five, is an eternity.  And yet, try to take a Fuji F30 or F31 away from its owner and you'll get the Charlton Heston NRA line (from my cold dead hands)!  In time, I may have the same feelings for the Sony DSCV-3.<br /><br />I was lucky to get one of these (thanks Stefan B!) in as close to new condition as you can imagine a 5 year old camera to be.  It's construction is tank-like, considering it's not shockproof. It won't fit in your pants pocket, but a small pouch will do nicely.  By today's standards, it's not very wide at that end, and the start up time is slow.  But the focusing is lightning fast.  Sony's holograph AF emitter is as good as you've heard.  This is easily the best low light focusing camera I have.<br /><br />You may have heard about the softness at f8 phenomenon.  It's true.  I'm going to use this camera primarily in aperture priority or manual, and stay clear of the scene modes.  Understand this, and have fun with it!  I want a viewfinder in addition to the LCD, which is why I don't have an LX3.  I also feel that the megapixel wars have ruined some good ideas (Canon G10 anyone?)in cameras, so here's hoping I can stretch this beauty for a long time.  Perhaps Sony will look at the success of the G10 and the LX3 and bring back the V-series to compete.","How could you offer to sell this camera for $999.00 on December, 2008, when I bought this very same camera during the summer of 2005 for $299.00 from Beach Camera in New Jersey?  I also bought the flash from Amazon for less than 60 dollars.  Unless this camera has become a collector's item, I don't see any reason for its price to have tripled since 2005, given that there are newer models, and many Digital SLR's for lower prices.","After 3 years of backpacking in South America, Central America and the Rocky Mountains (plus some urban tourism also) and ~15,000 great pictures taken in 14 countries, our DSCV3 is still going strong.  Heat and humidity in jungles and subzero temperatures at several summits up to 18,000 feet haven't kept it from taking pro-quality shots.  I love its numerous features like similar SLRs, but without the bulk, plus the video and night-shot capabilities that SLRs don't have.  Because of it's size, I carry the camera discreetly in one pocket and the zoom and wide-angle lenses on the other, and can go into crowded markets without fear of getting mugged.  About 8,000 pictures ago, it went into a river in the Ecuador jungle and the Sony dealer in Quito serviced it and it was as good as new.","I bought my V3 in February of 2005 so this is a long term report.  I've shot at least 5000 photos with it over the years and I'm still happy with it and it hasn't broke or gave me trouble.  I came to this from years of using a Canon F1 and EF.  Outside of the cool factor, I can't say I miss my old film cameras.  Don't miss the weight on my neck either.<br /><br />Just ordered the Sony HVL-F32X flash unit for this since I have confidence that I'm not ready to move on to another camera until I forced to by circumstance.  Hope I don't drop it ;)<br /><br />Wes<br /><br />Not so happy now (2012).  I learned a few months ago that the shutter button has a habit of breaking off.  On a fairly expensive camera, a tiny piece of under engineered plastic that is critical failing is not acceptable.  Lowered rating from 5 to 3  It was a great camera for its time.","It seems like compact digital cameras are being phased out at hyper-speed these days as each model is quickly supplanted by the next generation.  These new cameras usually boast a boost in megapixels and zoom range, but those who look beyond the marketing mayhem are aware that more is not necessarily better.<br /><br />Meanwhile, my V3 still holds its own three years after I purchased it.  I've looked carefully at the current crop of compact digital cameras out now, and I've come to the conclusion that none are worthy of replacing my V3, though I expect that day will come eventually.<br /><br />In general, I am very happy with the features, performance, image quality, and reliability.  There are only two things I wish this camera had:<br /><br />*A wider angle lens (at least down to 28mm equiv.)<br />*Image stabilization (or better yet, a wider aperture)<br /><br />I realize it is possible to address both these issues on the V3: by attaching a wide angle conversion lens for the former, and by putting the camera on a tripod for the latter.  But it would be nice if these features were included as standard capabilities.  If they had been, this camera would have been a home run.  As it is, I still give the V3 4 stars...even by today's standards.","1.  I know it really doesn't make much sense to write a review on a camera that has been discontinued for many years, but I just wanted to document that this camera is still one of the best cameras I've ever owned / used.

Kudos to Sony for producing this gem.","This camera is phenomenal and definitely the best camera I've owned. I've had the camera now for about 3 years and it still amazes me with the quality and clarity of photos I get from it. I had a Canon Powershot prior and wish I had this Sony DSCV3 instead. The fact that the Sony DSCV3 accepts both the Memory Stick and Compact Flash (and yes both in the camera at the same time) made it easy moving from the Canon which was Compact Flash only.<br /><br />There are so many settings capable on this camera as well as the scene modes, its hard to take a bad picture. Even with low light situations the hologram projection makes capturing your photo easy. Some situations definitely benefit from having the external flash unit available.<br /><br />I also love the Multi Burst and Speed Burst modes of the Sony DSCV3. These settings allow you to take several continuos shots in succession, typically for moving objects. It works great, does take some getting use to, and the recording time seams a little long at times. This recording time being the main thing it takes practice to get use to.<br /><br />I also have used the video capture capabilites quite a bit on various vacation trips and am very pleased with the results. Again, this is where the dual cards in the camera at the same time comes in handy, you can capture video to the Memory Stick card and capture your photos to the Compact Flash card. Very simple to do and provides for a lot of storage space.<br /><br />I did not like the Picture Package software that came with the camera, but I found a couple software programs I do like a lot, Corel's Photo Album 6 Deluxe is great for downloading the photos and videos from your camera as well as orgainizing them and most importantly, backing them up to an external hard drive and DVDs. I also have used the Corel Paint Shop product for editing my photos, one of the easiest to use that I've found. However, with the Sony DSCV3 I find the biggest thing I correct on my photos is the red eye. Even though it has the red eye reduction settings, you still get some red eye, depending on whether or not the people you are shooting are looking right at the camera lens or not.<br /><br />I'll probably have this camera for some time to come. The one I will look at next will be the Sony Alpha. Loving their cameras!","It has dual memory slots for compact flash and ...SD i think is the other one. It has no memory on it's own, so you do need to get one. The battery life is pretty good. It plugs into the wall to recharge, so no more running down to the store for a pack of AA's<br /><br />  The photo quality is very good, even at just 3 MP. I recommend using it with a tripod whenever possible, specially in low light situations.<br /><br />  And the focus is kinda clumsy, but still a great digital camera.","This is my 2nd digital camera and after a month I am very pleased.  It is the fastest for its category and it still fits in a coat pocket.  Yet it has many advanced features you don't find on a small camera.  If you are shooting wildlife, action or small kids, nothing beats a camera that starts fast and responds quickly to shutter release.  The add on lense feature is also well thought out and since you have a hot shoe you don't have to worry about the small flash on the camera being hidden by the add on flash.  Two types of memory card allows you to use one for stills and one for video or backup stills.  Good design and lightweight","I purchased 3 cheap cameras ($20, $99, $150) before learning my lesson. I did quite a bit of research (mainly looking at reviews) before I selected the DSC-V3. My reasons for choosing it were the excellent consumer and expert reviews, the price, and the image quality.<br /><br />I found the camera was not only easy to use, but produced great pictures. You can use either Memory Stick or CompactFlash memory cards. Comes with a lithium battery and has good battery life as well as decent recharging time.<br /><br />The camera doesn't come with a memory card, which is kind of a pain, and if you're looking for one of those teeny pocket-size digital cameras, this is really not the camera for you. I personally like the larger size, but maybe that's because it makes it feel fancy and expensive.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this camera if you're looking for something that can give you really nice pictures without a lot of hassle.<br /><br />Pros- 2 types of memory storage, image quality, large LCD<br /><br />Cons- no memory card included, size/weight","Awsome Camera it takes crisp clear pics you can take pic form books and magazine and be able to read the lines from the picture crisp and clear amazing camera.

This camera by far is the best digital I ever own, and for the price it really is great!! I know there are better cameras out there, but I can take pro-shots without paying the pro-prices. I do suggest however, no matter how much of a pro you think you are, you should take time to fiddle with all of the features...I found some to be great shortcuts, and great for some artsy shots.<br /><br />I am a graphic designer, and this camera is great for anyone! My main reason to purchase this was to take away from photoshop time, and actually get great pictures without using a bunch of filters...Buy this camera, you won't be disappointed!","I've had this camera for a little more than a week now, and have thoroughly run it through the paces, exploring every nuance.  It is an awfully nice camera, with some unusual features.  If it has any weakness at all, it is the initial difficulty with the PC connectivity, which is exacerbated by the poor treatment given to that subject in the manual.  I'll try to explain what's wrong there, and maybe you'll have less difficulty than I had.  But first, I'll tell you a little bit about the distinguishing features of this camera.<br /><br />First off, I like this class of camera, because I feel that it gives you the most important capabilities of a digital SLR, but without the excessive bulk.  I also appreciate the convenience of an automatic lens cap, which is not ordinarily a feature of SLRs.  If what you primarily want is the manual controls that you get with an SLR, then you don't have to buy an SLR to get that, and you can still have a camera that will take excellent pictures.<br /><br />One feature that attracted me to the DSC-V3 is the speed.  It isn't the fastest camera on startup, with roughly 3 seconds from the time that you press the power button until it is ready to take a picture.  Once it is ready to go, it is one fast camera, rivaling the digital SLRs.  It is exceptionally quick to focus when you press the shutter button half way, then the delay from when you press the button all the way until it takes the picture is imperceptible, and finally the delay from when the picture is taken until it is ready to take another picture, is about a second, albeit greater as slow shutter speeds due to the unique approach to noise reduction (which I'll discuss in a moment).  If you wait until you can see the image in the LCD again before pressing the shutter again, you can take 10 pictures in about 15 seconds.  If you put it in burst mode, it will take pictures at a rate of about one picture per second, until you release the button or until the card is full.  Using the \"speed burst\" mode, it takes 8 full-resolution, 7.2 megapixel pictures, in fine jpeg format, in about 3 seconds, but then you have to wait a little while for it to transfer the files from internal memory to the flash memory card.  All of this assumes that you aren't using the flash of course, because anytime that you use a strobe flash with any camera, you have to wait for the capacitor to recharge.<br /><br />By the way, you can use either Compact Flash cards or Sony's Memory Stick.  If you want to shoot movies in the finest format that is available, you have to use Memory Stick Pro.  I wasn't planning to use this camera to shoot movies, but I wanted the inter-shot delay to be as small as possible, and I wanted the wait period after shooting in speed burst to be minimized.  I found myself wondering whether the speed of data transfer from the camera to the memory card would be limited by the camera or the data card.  I bought a Memory Stick Pro card, and did some tests comparing it to a Compact Flash card that I had in an older camera.  The Memory Stick Pro reduced the delays by a significant amount in every shooting mode.  It appears that the delay in every mode is determined primarily by the write speed of the memory card, so if you can find comparative data on the write speed of different categories of Compact Flash and Memory Stick, those numbers should translate directly to the delay between successive pictures and the number of pictures that you can take in a given period of time.<br /><br />Let's see, some of the other distinguishing features of this camera are the Hologram auto-focus assist light, and of course the Night Framing and Night Shot modes.  The Hologram AF assist light uses a low-power laser to project a sharp, fine cross-hatch pattern on the subject.  This works in complete darkness, and although it works better when the subject has some contrast lines of its own, in most cases it will permit the camera to focus instantaneously on a flat wall in a dark room.  It works better in the dark, and the camera will not try to use it if it isn't dark enough, but when the subject distance is great and there is still enough light for the camera to focus using ambient light, you get better results by turning it off.  The manual says that it works to a distance of about 10 feet.  I know from experience that it works at least twice that far, but haven't experimented beyond that.<br /><br />The Night Framing capability lets you use the IR lamp to preview and frame your picture in the darkness, but then using the flash to take the picture, so that you get a normal picture with the flash instead of the monochromatic, greenish image that you get in Night Shot mode, which disables the flash and uses the IR to capture the image.  The IR lamp built into the camera is not very strong, and doesn't work well beyond 10 feet or so.  In fact, Night Shot mode is really only practical when used with a tripod, due to the slow shutter speeds needed with the dim IR light.  If you bought a separate IR light, you could probably do some serious IR photography at night, and with the help of an IR-pass filter, you could possibly do daylight IR photography, although that would be hampered somewhat by the fact that the IR modes are only available in the camera modes where the camera has full control of both shutter speed and aperture.  (The IR-blocking filter that normally shields the sensor from IR, is moved out of the way in these modes.  It isn't clear to me whether attempting to use these modes in the daylight could damage the camera, but at the least you won't get a correct exposure in Night Shot mode, since the metering seems to apply a special correction factor to compensate for the sensor's sensitivity to IR, and this throws off the exposure whenever the amount of ambient full-spectrum light overwhelms the amount of IR.)<br /><br />Three metering modes are available, and three focusing methods are available.  With the Flexible Frame focusing method, the focusing frame is small and you can position it wherever you like in the LCD, to focus on a subject not in the center of the frame.  You can't do the same thing with the metering, but you can use spot metering in conjunction with the exposure lock button.  That is, you first aim the camera where you want the metering to be peformed using spot metering, then press (and release) the AE lock button, then re-frame the image, and then focus using the Flexible Frame positioned where you like, or use one of the other two focusing methods, or set the focus to a preset distance.  While that much flexibility is available, in most scenarios where you want the metering and the focusing to apply to the same subject area that happens to be off center, you would leave the Flexible Frame in the center of the LCD, then aim the camera at the small subject area of interest and press the shutter button half way to lock both the exposure and the focus, then reframe the image and zoom as desired before pressing the shutter button the rest of the way.<br /><br />The AE lock button is located above the LCD, as are the two buttons that you use to control the focusing method, and the exposure compensation button.  The four-way navigation buttons are overloaded, as is the norm, so that when you haven't pressed the menu button or done something else to change the function of those buttons, those four buttons are used for selection of the flash mode, macro mode, self-timer, and quick review of the last picture taken.<br /><br />By the way, the quick review feature only works for the last picture you took.  To review other pictures and movies, or to resize them, delete them, protect them from deletion, rotate them, etc., you turn the mode dial on top of the camera to the \"Play\" position.  Some users will find this inconvenient and will wonder why the quick review button doesn't take you to this mode, and why there even is a \"Play\" position on the mode dial.  Regardless, the quick review feature is at least useful for zooming/magnifying the last picture that you took, to see whether it was in focus.<br /><br />The button that selects Night Framing, Night Shot, or normal, is on top of the camera, next to the power button and the mode dial.  The back of the camera also has dedicated buttons for selecting the recorded image size (which functions as the delete button during quick review and the Play position of the Mode dial), for accessing the menus, and for selecting the LCD mode.<br /><br />The zoom contol (rocker) is on the back, up high near where your thumb rests.  It is perhaps not as high as you'd like, and part of the reason for that is that between the zoom control and the mode dial, there is a little thumb wheel that protrudes edge-wise, which you spin with your thumb to select the shutter speed, aperture, program shift, and exposure compensation value, according to the mode that you have selected of course.  The only capture mode in which the jog dial isn't used is the fully automatic mode, where the camera is in total control of the exposure settings.  The jog dial is functional and easy to use whenever you select the program shift mode (P), the shutter priority mode (S), the aperture priority mode (A), or the manual mode (M).<br /><br />You use the menus for settings such as the metering mode, record mode (normal, burst, bracketing, TIFF, etc.) white balance, ISO (sensor sensitivity), scene mode selection (twilight, portrait, etc.), jpeg quality factor, etc.  For these sorts of menu selections, you make your selection simply by navigating using the 4-way buttons, i.e., without pressing the center button to confirm your selection.  For the menus that you access in play mode, which you use to edit and delete images, rotate them, etc., it is different in that you use the center navigation button to confirm your actions, so there is little chance to screw up.  I especially like the way you access the setup screens through a special position of the mode dial, as opposed to entering it through the menu as you do on many cameras (which makes the menus more cluttered and less intuitive).<br /><br />I should say something about the auto-focusing mode, which is not the same thing as the AF method.  You select the AF mode via the setup screen, and you can set it to Single, in which case the camera only attempts to focus when you press the shutter button half way, and then it locks the focus along with the exposure controls.  You can also select Monitor, in which case the camera maintains a useful degree of focus as you move the camera around, which shortens the time that it takes the camera to focus even more and avoids the need to press the shutter button half way when all you want to do is check the framing.  In Monitor AF mode, the focus still locks when you press the shutter button half way, so you can have this nice feature yet still be able to lock the focus and then reframe the image.  Continuous AF mode is like Monitor AF up until you press the shutter button half way.  In Continuous AF mode, the focus doesn't lock along with the exposure controls, but instead it continues to focus right up until the shutter is released, which is useful when the distance between you and the subject is changing rapidly.<br /><br />Uh oh, there is still one more feature that I need to tell you about.  One of the limitations of digital cameras in general is that the sensors all have a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), which becomes worse as the sensitivity is increased, i.e., at higher ISO, the noise is worse.  But the noise also gets worse as the shutter speed decreases.  The DSC-V3 uses an interesting technique to reduce sensor noise at slower shutter speeds.  Immediately after the shutter is closed when an image has been captured at a slow shutter speed, the shutter remains closed and another \"picture\" is taken, with the shutter closed, for the same duration of time.  That \"picture\" is subtracted from the captured image, to cancel the noise.  It doesn't work miracles, but it definitely is effective, and definitely improves the quality of images taken at low light and slow shutter speeds, especially at higher ISO settings.<br /><br />Before moving on to talk about PC connectivity, there is still one more thing that I need to talk about.  On a couple of the popular (and highly informative) web sites that review cameras, they point out the reduced sharpness of the image that occurs at smaller apertures such as F8.  They did this in a way that can cause the reader to misunderstand how this concern applies to the DSC-V3 differently from similar cameras.  The reason that this happens is that some amount of light that enters the lens will strike the edge of the aperture and will be diffracted.  If that quantity of light is significant relative to the quantity of light that reaches the sensor cleanly refracted by the lens, the image will be less sharp.  Aperture diffraction is a well-known physical phenomenon of waves in general, and anyone who has a general knowledge of optical systems will tell you that when the quality of an optical system is \"diffraction-limited\", this is the best possible scenario for that system, since if the quality is not limited by aperture diffraction, it is limited by something else that should have been avoided.  The only way that the DSC-V3 can be any different in this respect is if, in the full automatic mode, in bright daylight it uses an aperture that is smaller than is necessary, instead of using a faster shutter speed.  In full automatic mode, the DSC-V3 will go to F4.0 at 1/250 s, and then will decrease the aperture in small steps and won't increase the shutter speed to 1/500 s until the aperture has reached F8.  I don't know how this compares to other similar cameras, but regardless it doesn't matter much to me because whatever difference there is between this camera and other similar cameras will only be in whether the other camera avoids F8 until the shutter speed has been increased to 1/500 s or perhaps 1/1000 s.  The only way that you can avoid this effect with any camera is to understand it and take control.  This is but one of the various reasons why a camera might not take as good a picture in full automatic mode that it would take if the photographer intervenes, and hardly deserves to be brought to anyone's attention unless every other possible failure that can occur in the full automatic mode is discussed as well, and that could take a very long time.<br /><br />Darn it! I forgot to tell you about Smart Zoom ... When you select a recorded picture size smaller than the full sensor resolution (as you might if your memory card is nearly full), Smart Zoom lets you use digital zoom, but doesn't let you zoom past the point where the number of sensor pixels remaining will be less than the number of pixels in the recorded image size.  As long as you have plenty of space on your memory card, you probably wouldn't want to select a picture size smaller than 7 Megapixel, but if you did, you'd probably like to be able to use the digital zoom if only you could be confident that you hadn't zoomed past the point where the number of pixels that remain after the sensor cropping is less that the number of pixels that you are going to record.  Smart zoom is nice in that respect, but of course if you never use a picture size smaller than the full 7 megapixel, then it is entirely the same as disabling the digital zoom.<br /><br />I've told you a lot about the camera, and now I'm going to tell you about the PC connectivity side of things, which is very important for digital cameras.<br /><br />Getting the camera to connect to the PC via the USB port was a piece of cake, as is the norm with USB interfaces.  But I did not find the Picture Package application intuitive, and I was irritated by the fact that the installation set it up with two icons in the system tray, and even worse, an application that is started automatically when the PC is booted.  I called Sony more to express my displeasure with this than to actually solicit help, but for Picture Package issues, they point you to the company that makes it, Pixela.  Pixela's tech support people were very helpful.  I didn't mind the application launching as soon as I connected the camera, but I didn't want it to immediately start copying the images from the camera, and I certainly didn't want it to copy the images that it had already copied the previous time that I connected it.<br /><br />With Picture Package, you cannnot pick and choose individual pictures that you want to download, but you can make configurations settings that will determine whether or not the download starts automatically when the application is started, and whether or not images that it has already copied will be copied again, and whether or not the images on the camera will be deleted after being copied to the PC.  The ability to avoid copying pictures that have already been copied, turns out to be very smart.  You can make selections that influence what Picture Package looks at to determine whether a picture on the camera already exists on the PC.  (It doesn't attempt to keep a log on the PC, which would inevitably get screwed up.)  Each time that Picture Package copies files to the PC, it creates a new folder that is located under a folder that corresponds to the date that the copy is performed (creating that folder the first time that you perform a copy on a given day), and with that folder, there are sub-folders that parallel the folders that you have created in the memory card in the camera.  When you capture a picture in TIFF or RAW mode in the camera, a jpeg is recorded in parallel, and when these two files are copied to the PC, Picture Package gives them the same name, differing only in the suffix.  To determine whether a given picture already exists on the PC, Picture Package compares the EXIF data in the jpeg files in the Picture Package folder on the PC, e.g., the date and time that the picture was taken, and the size.  If you want, you can even tell it to compare the images, which I assume is a byte-by-byte comparison of the two files, but as long as the EXIF data is intact and correct, that seems unnecessary.<br /><br />I blame the user manual for the initial difficulty that I had with Picture Package.  The instructions for Windows users endeavors to distinuish between Windows XP and other versions of Windows.  The essential fact that underlies this distinction, which is not made in the least bit clear in the manual, is that if you use Windows XP, the instructions that apply to you, apply not to the installation of Picture Package, but to how you can use the Scanner and Camera Wizard instead.  This distinction is important from several standpoints, including that a different USB mode setting is needed in the camera, depending on whether you use that Wizard or use Picture Package.  The only place where there is a meaningful mention of the difference in the Normal and PTP modes of the USB port is in the table toward the back of the manual, that summarizes the various Menu settings and settings in the Setup screen, but even there, it isn't at all clear that one setting is for Picture Package and the other is for the Scanner and Camera Wizard of Windows XP.  The worst offense in the manual, however, is where on the page that talks about connecting the camera to the computer, in small print there is a note that says that if you have Windows XP, to skip forward 2 pages.  Immediately following that note there is a picture of the LCD showing that USB normal mode is selected, but nowhere is there a similar picture for Windows XP, and because that picture and the text that goes with it is indented under the advisory comment for XP users, you wonder if it is supposed to apply to XP users.  After you skip forward two pages to where the XP-specific stuff is, which talks about using the XP wizard, you flow without interruption directly into a section that talks about the folder structure on the PC.  There is absolutely nothing that suggests that this only pertains to Picture Package and does not apply if you use the XP wizard method.  That is particularly unfortunate, because it obscures an important distinction between Picture Package and the XP wizard.  If you use the XP wizard, things may be simpler at first, because you don't have to figure out how to configure Picture Package, but you won't get Picture Package's smart folder structure on the PC, or the naming scheme that logically binds the RAW or TIFF file with the corresponding jpeg file that has the EXIF data.  If you have Windows XP and prefer not to use the XP method, you can use the Picture Package method just as easily as users of other versions of Windows.  If you have Windows XP, I will advise you to ignore the instructions that are specific XP users, and follow the other Windows instructions instead.  It may take you a little while to figure out to get Picture Package to not start copying files as soon as it is started, and to not copy the same files over again when it is connected, but once you have that straightened out, Picture Package is a vast improvement over the Windows XP Scanner and Camera Wizard.<br /><br />Not that Picture Package is perfect.  In the thumbnail view, Picture Package doesn't show the file name suffix, so until you learn that the first of two files that have the same name is the jpeg, you have a 50/50 chance of being able to see the EXIF data when you double-click on one of those two thumbnails to open the single-image view for that file.  It would be nice if you could see the EXIF data in the thumbmail view, and it would be nice if you could even do that for the RAW/TIFF image, since it wouldn't be that hard for Picture Package to read the content of the file that has the same name as the RAW/TIFF file except that the suffix is different.<br /><br />I played around with RAW files using Picture Package, but found it not well suited to working with RAW files.  If you really want to work with RAW files, which have the data as it was taken from the sensor but before the procesing that applies white balance, saturation, color, sharpness, and contrast adjustments that you have set in the camera, you need to install the other CD, which has the Image Data Converter application.  Picture Package will let you view RAW files, and make a couple of basic corrections, but it is painstakingly slow and crude.  The adjustment that is labeled \"exposure compensation\", by the way, is not the same thing as doing exposure compensation on the camera.  If you really want to work with RAW files, I would advise installing the second CD right off the bat and not using Picture Package for anything more that copying the files and viewing them only in the thumbnail view.<br /><br />The DSC-V3 is an excellent camera.  When you count the number of unique features, that are not found on other cameras of this class, which bridges the gap between compact digital cameras and DSLR cameras, you wonder why it is that you can have this much more for the same price as the others.  The advantage in speed alone is enough to give this camera a competitive edge, but then it also has the Hologram auto-focus light, Night Framing and Night Shot, an effective approach to noise cancellation, and lesser but still useful features such as Smart Zoom.  The size of the camera is nearly perfect, being just big enough to be comfortable when shooting, but no bigger.  It has a large LCD screen that is easy to see in all kinds of light.  It takes excellent pictures.  And if all that isn't enough, it's a very handsome camera!","I bought this camera after seeing the high quality night pictures its earlier version could take; I wanted to have really beautiful pictures at night, but I got even more... I haven't finished to read the manual yet, but so far, this camera worth every penny you pay for it, it takes the finest-high-quality pictures even if you didn't mean it!!!","UPDATE July 7, 2006 - After 9 good months, this camera just completely died mid-use.  Motherboard fried for no reason!<br />No world-wide guarantee and $700 to fix here in Singapore (yes, much more than the camera cost)!  Now the camera is worthless to me since I am not coming back to the USA soon.<br />Can't seem to reduce this to 1 star now...<br /><br />What WAS a great experience has gone down the tubes...<br /><br />THE OLD REVIEW BELOW<br />----------------------------------<br />After trying out several other cameras (Nikon & Cannon) over 3 months, I decided this one was the perfect one for me!<br />I will be backpacking for a LONG time through India and neighboring countries and needed the smallest and most versatile camera I could find - (D-SLRs are too large).<br />Got a 2GB CF card, 1GB Memory stick and 2 batteries.  This setup was around $700 and will allow 1-3 weeks of shooting!<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />1. Its very compact for the features it has.<br />2. High grade digital circuitry, feels like a fast, durable device.<br />3. Excellent manual controls for a non-SLR.<br /><br />FAVORITES:<br />1. Digital SmartZoom is awesome: Sharp, Web-quality pics at 19x zoom with -NO ADDITIONAL OPTICS-  !!!<br />2. Built in lens cap, fast on / off mean you won't miss the shot.<br />3. Plug-N-Play USB2 (no software) = download pics anywhere in the world.<br />4. Multi-voltage AC adaptor = recharge the batteries (in the camera) anywhere in the world.<br />5. Good, builtin adjustable flash.<br />6. Large LCD = allows more in-camera editing/deleting for when you don't have a computer.<br /><br />DRAWBACKS:<br />1. Can only see last picture taken with quick-review. Must switch to \"playback\" mode to see others.<br />2. Agree that \"auto\" setting underexposes pictures.","I have now had my new DSCV3 for about 3 weeks.  Very easy to use, great quality pictures.  The red eye leaves something to be desired.  All in all, great camera, and I am not unhappy with my purchase.","I love this camera... i had a P150 before and this camera is even better. It is easy to use and the results are very good. My daughters ages 7 and 11 are also able to use it and produce great pictures.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this camera.","Recently purchased the SONY DSC V3 and am very happy with it.  Best feature is the large LCD and 7.2 megapixel.  Only con is that some controls, particularly the knob on top and the shutter button, feel kind of cheap.  Some have complained of the flash, but I think it works great indoors and not so great outdoors more then a few feet away... but that is expected from a small flash on any camera.  Definitely the best camera for the money as it includes some great features including the ability to use compactflash and memory sticks at the same time.","I've been using the DSC-V3 under a wide variety of conditions for about 1 1/2 months here in Costa Rica...from night scenes to beach scenes to tropical jungle settings in low light. Overall I've been very satisfied with the image quality, but especially the performance. Its definitely a rock-solid performer in terms of shutter lag and shot-to-shot times. Auto focus is also instantaneous. You click, it takes a photo...and fast. I have a 1 Gig memory stick pro card and the write times to that are fantastic (except in RAW and TIFF modes). You'll be impressed by most of the performance issues, and if you use the camera right you'll get great crystal-clear 7MP images with great color edge-to-edge. So in a sense this is a plain camera; meat and potatoes...a good hearty camera which delivers in those areas a camera should. It shoots fast, battery life is great, build quality is solid, the 2.5\" LCD is great, and the images it produces are top notch. Ignore the optical viewfinder, and go get yourself a PDA screen protector to cover the LCD with...then you're good to go.<br /><br />What they say about the aperture being selected as too small in Auto mode (under bright light) is true. But don't base a purchase decision on that...if you are an \"enthusiast\", you'll likely be using one of the modes with some custom control, like program shift or manual. Its easy enough to change the aperture before you snap a shot. I do that 90% of the time...I don't like blindly trusting a computer to make decisions anyway. I'd argue that if you are not really into tweaking settings...there are cheaper cameras out there that would be more satisfying to you.  But keep in mind you CAN use it on Auto mode just fine in all conditions except bright outdoor lighting.<br /><br />Before buying this camera I debated the merits of this style of camera VS the long-zoom image stabilized models VS a digital SLR. I racked my brain over the merits of each over and over. I think after all that I've decided that a Digital SLR would have been more suitable for me. But that's not to knock this camera in any way...it does great for its range of capabilities. The ISO sensitivity is decent, but I was really looking for something more on par with a DSLR in terms of better high ISO capabilities. I was a bit dissapointed, not by the Sony per se...but by the overall capabilities of this class of camera in low light (except the Sony laser focusing system, incredible!). You will get noisy images at ISO 400 or above in dark conditions. Two things to consider about low light capability, image stabilization and high ISO sensitivity. If you get an image-stabilized camera you will have more flexibility for common situations...\"twilight\" scenes and real common \"pseudo-indoor\" situations. That's something you don't really hear about in the professional reviews but is real practical in terms of usability. Forget about the utility of image stabilization with long-zoom...think about its usability for low light conditions. With image stabilization you will get that little wavvy hand (indicating a blurred image) much less frequently before you snap a shot (2 stops?). And for those dark tripod-only long exposures...nothing beats noise-free high ISO sensitivity. Ideally it would be the best to have great ISO sensitivity AND image stabilization, if you get both in a digital camera you will use a tripod 1/3 as much, and have a much more versatile camera.<br /><br />That being said, I don't really regret not getting one of the long-zoom image stabilized models (Canon S2IS, Panasonic DMC-FZ20, etc). I feel better knowing the money went into a solid performing camera with good resolution and quality. I feel comfortable with my purchase over those types of cameras. I'm curious about something like the Canon Rebel XT, but most DSLRs only can have lense-based image stabilization, which enormously increases the cost of each lens if you want IS (its like buying a computer with each lens). I find myself dreaming about...and looking for something like the Konica Minolta Maximum 7D...a DSLR with body-based image stabilization. I think that's where all these cameras will eventually be heading, in a year or two I'll bet you'll see all the major DSLR manufacturers have models with body-based image stabilization.<br /><br />This Sony is a great camera to learn photography on, largely because of that huge LCD. Overall, the camera is great and I would have given it 5 stars except for the viewfinder, and I would have liked to see a slightly longer, more versatile zoom. Another feature I would like to see would be the ability to attach full camera info for standard images, not just the date and time (RAW lets you see that info). That way you could snap 100 shots with different settings, and when you get those images to the computer there would be no guessing as to what settings were used...you could carefully compare the results of each shot to learn faster and become a sharper photographer.","I have only had this camera out of the box for 3 hours now, and have already 1) taken pictures in total night, 2) made a short movie clip and edited it, 3) transferred all media to computer and emailed it out - both pictures and movies, 4) printed excellent photos with mid range HP inkjet printer and glossy card stock, 5) created pocketpc version of movie and transferred it and photos to pda device.<br /><br />Quality on all was pleasing - pocket pc versions were probably the darkest and could have used some touch up, but that's my point - I did all this with NO TOUCH UP or fiddling with controls.  I can only imagine what can be done when I really dig in.<br /><br />This camera was more than worth the money - it is small and compact, not quite as small a profile as to tuck in a purse easily as I was hoping, but one-fourth the size of my 35mm Canon, and so much QUICKER!  No more waits at the photo lab, having to remember to go there twice to drop off and pick up.  Oh my stars this was sooo worth it!<br /><br />I was afraid of all the \"learning\" I would have to do to figure it out, but my gosh this camera - partnered with picasa and windows movie maker - makes one heck of a package deal!","It is very nice camera just like a lot of people wrote. Here I only want to point out cons. in this camera as follow:<br /><br />1. No wide angle option like canon s60, pro 1.<br /><br />2. No good marco option ( minimum distance is 10cm, it is  hard to shoot small object. but canon pro 1 has super marco so that you can shoot object as close as 2.4 cm).<br /><br />3. Built-in flash is not very effective ( effective range is only less than 3 meters), fortunately, this has hot shoe but external flash is very pricy.<br /><br />4. you need memory stick pro to use high qulity vedio. it is very costy.","I just had a baby girl in January and of course want to take a million pictures of her growing up just as I did with my son.  I still have the digital camera I bought before he was born and have been using it until my husband began pressuring me to buy a new camera.  I didn't want to let go of my camera let me tell you!  It is a Fuji FinePix 1.3 megapixel digital camera!  Yeah, I know it is time to put it away.  Anyway, we have been shopping for a new digital camera and I just loved the look and feel of the Sony V3.  We actually went to a few stores and went back to look at the V3 about 3 times.  Well, needless to say we just had to take it home.  I've only had it a couple of days but the picture quality is great.  I'm really excited to learn all of the functions on it and hopefully will take awesome pictures of my children.  I know if I've had my Fuji for 5 years, this one should definitely last longer!","I have this a camera for about 3 months now. Enough time for me to say something. I'm a previous owner of point shoot camera. From 300, 640, 1, 3.2 mega pixel of various make & models (all ps). I have been to digital photo world since my first kid was 2, now she's 9. My main concern for a camera is the picture quality which is no doubt, this camera has clear sharp pictures. I don't care much about mega pixel. I've seen sharp and clear pictures taken with only 1 mp. I had mine set to 5 mp. This is not a pro or slr camera but picture quality is very close enough. Ergonomic, compactness beats the slr. Appertures, shutters, iso, focus can be adjusted manually just like the slr's.<br /><br />These are the things I like with this camera, speed, you will be amazed how fast this camera responds between shoots, long battery life, we spend the whole day one of the amusement park here, did not bother changing my battery. most of my pictures taken with fill flash with the lcd monitor on. I got used to bring a couple of spare batteries. Dual media is great. I have 1 gig cf ultra and 1 gig ms pro loaded. I don't need to worry about running out of memories. Everything is great about this camera, my only complain is the on-board flash. It seems like you're getting enough light to a certain distance but this can be fix buy investing an external flash which I plan to buy in the future. (32 or 1000 ?) I don't know yet!<br /><br />You will never go wrong with this camera. With this price, I paid more with my old sony 3.2 mp p-5 camera when they first came out.","I Own a Sony DSC-F828, and really wasn't looking for another camera, but the fact of the matter is that since the 828 is essentially a SLR camera, once you had the flash Etc. you got yourself one heavy piece of equipment!So seeing as we had a new baby coming along I found my self in the market for something lighter, but I was determined that it have as much of the power and capabilities as my 828.This was a tall order! The first camera wasn't a Sony at all it was the Canon G6 wich all in all was a fine camera and one I considered seriously until I saw the V3 on sony's web site. I sell camera's at BestBuy as one of my many jobs and I can tell you that that for every G6 we sell we sell 4 V3's heres why. First of all is the general design of the body, the G6 is essentially a box with a lens stuck on it! While the V3 is smaller and more contoured in shape and feel. One minus here, and I'm sure you've heard about this before... the eye piece on the V3 is poorly placed, and virtually useless, but with that big beautiful 2.5 LCD screen on the back you wont need it! As far as optics the G6 and V3 are just about dead even both having 4X optical, I give this one to Sony also because next to Canon I fell Ziess lenses are superior in optics and quality. (just an opinion) Next moving to flash ability, as far as on board flash this one goes to the Canon, the onboard with the V3 is useless for anything more than 5 or 6 feet away the Canon fared slightly better, both cameras equip with a hot shoe for an external flash, an when you slap the Sony X-32 flash on the V3 the results or nothing short of astounding again blowing the G6 out of the water! Another quick note on the V3 flash, if you plan on buying the V3's lense hood from Sony or here at Amazon include an external flash in your budjet! The hood does cause shadowing!! Word to the wise. As far as function the V3 has a extremely fast start up time, 1.1 or 1.3 seconds,The G6 was a little slower. Getting into speed hear me when I tell you this...if you want a camera faster than this you need to start looking at SLR's. This ain't no Nikon 2600 or a Canon A85, the V3 and G6 are both extremely fast cameras, again I found the V3 to be faster ( remember because of my job I get to do hands on comparisons) On virtually every other score I found the V3 to be the better of the two cameras heres a quick list of some of the biggest advantages the V3 has:<br /><br />1.BIG LCD screen!! At last you can see what your shooting! Don't bother with the eye piece however, it just about useless!<br /><br />2.Easy to read and navagate menus. If you want to start messing around with shutters and apatures this is your camera.The scene settings are great too, but I recomend using \"P\" mode for most of your picture taking! (just remember to have a tri-pod ready in low light!)<br /><br />3. Video, video, video Sony is the undisputed king of on board digital camera video! Great sound, great Resolution It aint DVC, but it ain't bad either! You can get upto 44Minutes worth on a 1GB card (stick)! NO MORE CLIPS!!<br /><br />4. Decent battery life. About 220 minutes per charge. Im not sure about the G6 (A friend of mine owns one, and he said he got about the same.)<br /><br />5. Dual memory capability! A huge plus here! The ability to carry twice the memory ready and available right on the camera!Just flick the switch!If you are a volume picture taker this is a Gift from above for you. One minus however the V3 can't use Micro-Drives. (Maybe on next years model!?!?) The V4?<br /><br />6. Picture. The V3 takes clearer shrper pictures than it's counterpart, bottom line. Not to mention the fact that you can crop your shots within the camera, and even select the resolution of the new image!! Fantastic! Beat the snot out of the G6 in ambient and low light settings. The G6 does have better ISO response, but not by enough for me to reccomend it over the V3.<br /><br />7. A sane, Useful array of shutter speeds, and apature settings. I hate it when a camera adds  a 40 or 60 second shutter delay, or a 1/2000 shutter speed, and then charges you 300 or 400 bucks for your trouble! Most mortal picture takers like you and me don't need these! (hell Im a professional photographer and I rarely do) the V3 shutter speeds range from 30 seconds all the way up to a scorching 1/1000, the apatures are set up likewise, It's a nice selection of speeds, allowing the use some really nice creativity options!<br /><br />the apaturesThe Bottom Line, and what is it?<br /><br />Sony has again set the new standard for so called point and shoot cameras, by increasing functionality and power while maintaining a compact size.Just search through Amazon here and you will be astounded at all the extra's available for this little camera! I like to call these new cameras Hybrids because they combine a little of both worlds. Sony proved they are the masters at this when they released the DSC-F828 which in my opinion is one of the most amazing digital cameras ever made! Tempramental but amazing! And that is where I can best describe the V3, It has many of the features and most of power of its predacessor (F-828) but is much more user friendly and tolerent of misgudgement on the photographers part. With the G6 like the 828 I found I have to work for great shots (not that I mind working) but with the V3 they just seemed to happen. The camera seems to act like an extension of yourself, and that is what any great camera should do. So to Sony I say Bravo again!! I bought one for my father, one for me and every damn accessory for it I can lay my hands on! If your ready this could be and will be the last digital camera you'll ever have to buy. To the Canon people out there don't get mad, the G6 is a fantastic camera in every sense of the words, but the V3 is an experience in photography not just another tool for taking snapshots!Sorry!<br /><br />This is (if you'll excuse the pun) the best buy!","Do not buy Canon G6. Buy this one instead.  I have done the research and paid the price for you.<br /><br />When I buy cameras, the most important thing to me is picture quality.  I have owned two digital cameras (3 MP and 5 MP, both are Sony) and I was upgrading to 7MP.<br /><br />I narrowed my search to Sony V3 and Canon G6.  I thought G6 may deliver better picture qualify because it has a bigger lens.  I found out in a hard way that in this case, SIZE DOES NOT MATTER!<br /><br />Here is the story:  I bought a G6 about 3 months ago (at $599.99).  I compared it side by side (same objects same conditions) with my 3MP Sony DS75 and astonishingly saw that my three-year-old Sony DS75 beat the G6 both in resolution and color of the pictures.  I was very disappointed and decided to compare the G6 and V3.  I brought my compact flash card to a local chain store that sells both the G6 and V3.  The sales person was kind enough to let me take dozens of picture at the store using my compact flash card in both the G6 and V3.  I compared the pictures at home.  Every single shot (in door) by the V3 was better.<br /><br />What about ourdoor pictures? I bought the V3.  After coming home, I take many outdoor pictures using both the G6 and V3.  Again, the V3 outdoor pictures have much better resolution and color.  I was totally convinced that the G6 was just a piece of junk.<br /><br />Another thing for the G6:  It does not have date/time stamp unless you print in out in a Canon printer.  Years from now, I don't want to check the time I create the picture file to figure out when the pictures were taken.  If date/time stamp is important to you, another reason to forget about the G6.<br /><br />I returned the G6 (paid 15% restock fee).  I have taken over a thousand pictures with my V3 and I am very happy with it.  Picture quality is much better with the V3.  An excellent product.","I've shopped the market and for the price, nobody beats the Sony in picture quality, build quality, ergonomics (ease of use), or lens quality. Nobody. It's a sleeper, and before buying the new Canon Rebel, I accidently stumbled upon this camera. Mind you I already have an older generation Sony i've long since out grown. Right away I noticed something very special about this camera, its lag time (hardly) and giant 2.5\" super accurate LCD screen. One of the fastest digital cameras on the market including the pro DSLR's. From there I realized that everything fit my hand well and seemed in the appropriate spot. Being an avid outdoor person, lots of mountain biking etc... I wanted a compact lightweight camera with a heavyweight punch. That is what this camera is. I almost settled for the much larger DSLR's out there. Glad I didn't. Small enough to fit in a jersey pocket, and super lightweight (for what you get) I hardly feel it when im out there. Yet I can stop and take pics all day (3hour battery life avg. on a single charge, very impressive!!)if I want too. The 1Gig memory stick was very affordable (got mine for $109.00) and I have yet to fill it up on a single outing taking upwards to 300 pictures at a full 7.2 meg resolution!!! Did I mention how good the pictures are? There are alot of reviews on this camera out there, that speak highly of the picture quality with one snag. There are alot of claims about the camera automatically going to a high F number in bright sunlight. This however is easily remedied using the camera's built in Aperature priority mode, or manual mode. So I wonder if any of the reviewers actually owned this camera? Even though that seems to be the only complaint from the lot, i've yet to experience what they claim as \"reduced image quality, poor image quality\" in bright light conditions using the automatic modes (Ill keep trying however, there may be some truth to it). However, i've already taken upwards of 1000+ pics with it and have yet to see the Sony duplicate that claim. On the contrary the little Camera really seems to shine in bright light conditions, taking for me the most crisp, clear, and color filled pictures to date. You can say I am happy with it and look forward to learning everything it is capable of, the next step is you! Ill save you from the specs/additional features as you can go see them for yourself as im sure you will be more than pleased/satisfied. I've seen it on price war sites as low as $439.00, for that price its a steal, for the $569.00 I got it for it was a real good investment and worth every penny.","I was looking for a camera to take better pictures of my daughter, who is only 5 months old and has a hard time staying still.  Wanted  a fast camera but not a DSLR.  I can tell you that this camera is almost as fast as a DSLR, and has a ton of manual controls to allow for fine adjustment.  I was basically a P&S guy, but the camera is so intuitive that I am having fun learning the manual controls and am taking much better pictures as a result.  I also looked at the Canon G6 (I was also a big Canon fan), but the camera is too slow for my needs.  I am VERY happy with this purchase!","This was the first purchase that I have made through Amazon.com and I coult be more pleased. I the kind of person who comparison shops before making a purchase to be sure that I have the best deal. I normally came to Amazon for descriptions of pricing but never to buy. Well this time around they had the best price overall and I mean overall. Im in the military and live in Hawaii. So alot of companies charge like crazy for S&H. Not only was there price cheaper then our Military Store by $130...I also got FREE S&H to Hawaii. This camera will need a better Flash on low lighting situations indoor.","This 7MP camera stands by its own.  Has all the basic adjustments and the quality is top of the line.  Although Sony accessories are not cheap, they are long-lasting and some items, like the tripod can be used with other cameras.  Dual memory option is pretty useful.<br /><br />The battery lasts a long time and it displays the remaining battery time.  Some cameras just don't offer this option which is a MUST.<br /><br />If you plan to invest in a good camera, buy this one.  I use this camera a lot for website photos ([...] for example) and also I found that the add-on lenses really give crisp and natural photos.","Took about 100-150 photographs before realizing this camera needed a little help with both indoor and outdoor photographs.<br /><br />Indoor: The onboard flash is just not sufficient.  Large amounts of redeye, pets eyes looked like something off a horror movie and picture colors weren't the quality I was expecting.  I spent 3-4 hours touching up my first set of pictures with photo software (not included).  I purchased the HVL-F32X flash and the whole indoor world changed.  Redeye almost totally disappeared, my pets look friendly again and colors were much richer and fuller.  So add $140-150 to the price for an external flash, don't go cheap here.<br /><br />Outdoor: Pictures weren't as crisp as expected.  I believe it was caused by sunlight glare and the cameras aperture choice, so I added the VAD-VHA adapter and a Circular Polarizer which helped along with opening the aperture a little.  Other online reviews can explain how to do this.<br /><br />So my second set of photos needed almost no editing and I am very impressed by the quality.  The camera is solid and time from shot to shot is amazingly fast.  I am using a High-Speed MSX-512N Sony memory stick and a 256MB SanDisk Ultra II CF Card.  I noticed the write speed on the memory stick are slightly faster than the CF card.  But to be honest, I don't think the difference is that much to justify the extra cost of the memory stick.","I own several photo equipment and nothing will suit every situation. For huge enlargements needed for professional work nothing beats medium and large format film. Which is not what these cameras are made for. In the 7MP range the V3 is the best choice. Fairly priced and very good quality picture in a reasonably compact body.<br /><br />Canon G6 may have a little better quality image, but what is also important for snapshots is shutter lag time, that is the time between the moment you press the button and when the picture is taken. Here the V3 is unbeatable with less than 0.1 sec. This means that you won't loose the photo or have a blur instead of your children recorded. This is why I bought this camera, it is better to have a little less detail looking through a lupe than loosing the picture. Despite the startup time, 3 sec, which is not too long I think that this camera beats the other 7MPs because of the smaller shutter lag.<br /><br />Another thing that helps is that it accepts Compactflash. the only problem is having to buy a MS pro to be able to record high quality video, but I can live with that.<br /><br />When I can carry heavy stuff I bring film equipment or my Canon 10D. Otherwise the V3 is my choice, the ultra compact ones just don't have good enough picture quality for printing and the shutter lag is usually unbearable, so I think it is better to carry something a little bigger.<br /><br />If you want very high quality pictures, film like quality, you have to buy bulkier equipment like the Canon 20D (US$1,500.00). And for professional work Canon 1DS Mark II or a medium format digital, but then you have to spend from US$8,000.00 to US$25,000.00.<br /><br />So there is no point in people complaining about picture quality in a compact US$700,00 digital camera that delivers pictures with about the same quality as its competition. Sony makes very good digital cameras, not miracles.","Very nice camera all around.  Only 2 major issues with it:<br /><br />1 - More noise in pictures than I expected<br /><br />2 - Sony crippled the camera so you can't record Movie Mode in Fine unless you buy a Memory Stick Pro (which cost at least 2x as much)!! Even if you have a 80x CF card - what a joke!!  Come on Sony!","If one is looking at this camera you should be glad that this camera can record not only on Memory stick but also on CompactFlash Type I cards. So, for anyone trying to upgrade from Sony digicams with plenty of Memory Sticks, you can't beat this one. Also, for all those who complain about expensive Memory sticks, you have no reason to complain on this Sony ;-)!<br /><br />V3 has lot of advanced features professional photographers demand like those found in F717 while having all the auto features needed for normal family photographer.<br /><br />For someone trying to move from V-1 to V-3, you will be glad about the higer capacity battery and larger LCD, while you will miss the compactness of V-1. If you prefer smaller pocketable size, this will not fit your needs. You should consider DSC-W1.<br /><br />I feel V3's main strength is it's capability to take excellent indoor pictures. As a dad of two, I take most of my pictures indoors at parties and home and this camera stands up to the best digital camera I used for indoor photography namely, Sony's DSC-F717.","I own the FUJI S7000 and E550 both are 6.3 MEGs. I also just purchased the SONY DSC-P150 (7.2 MEGs) I took 20 pictures using each camera using the settings all set to AUTO. The pictures were from close up to max zoom. I then had the best of each camera enlarged to 12 in. by 18 in. at COSTCO high end FUJI processor. The FUJI colors were rich and not actual colors.<br /><br />The SONY P-150 was more true to actual color. Both SONY and FUJI were about the same in detail of the subject and were intuitive to operate plus fast to start up. I was looking for a smaller compact camera and the SONY is the best small and yet very good quality pictures. The FUJI has a 6 optical and excellent body shape. when I viewed the DSCV3 7.2 I was disapointed at how slow  the start up was. For that reason I decided not to buy the DSCV3. My NIKON 35MM is still way ahead in detail quality/color for enlagements!","This camera though very similar to the Canon G6 comes out ahead in some aspects:<br /><br />1) Cool Sleek Black Body with a nice feel and made out of metal and plastic;<br /><br />2) Several Night shooting modes including a very nice laser hologram focus tool;<br /><br />3) Dual memory slots for CF and MS;<br /><br />4) This one is the killer: Full Screen VGA video (G6 does not even come close);<br /><br />5) Pictures are more detailed and sharper than G6.<br /><br />6) Great 2.5-inch LCD which auto-brightens in low light<br /><br />7) Full on high speed USB2.0. Canon G6 has the older slower USB 1.0.<br /><br />I have always found the Sonys to be more reliable than the Canons..

I purchased the first about a year ago and have used it in the Wilds of Idaho taking pictures in all kinds of weather at every elevation imaginable. All the pictures have turned out great. I recently had a reason to take more pictures indoors, new grand daughter. Again the pictures have been fantastic, have had several blown to 11X17 for matting and framing, great quality. I would make several suggestion to folks, buy digital camera batteries, every camera I have owned eats batteries, this HP is no different. If you spend the money and get good quality batteries they will last!  Second recommendation get a SD Memory card, if you are like me you will not be happy with the interanl memory and want to take lots of pictures.  So, this photographer says you can't beat the price, for the quality and service you get from HP. I forgot to mention I had a camera that didn't work, and HP replaced within 2 days with a new one, no questions asked. Good Service goes a long way in my book.  Buy one you won't be sorry!","Great little camera with lots of features at a good price unless (a) you carry it in your pocket, in which case the very fragile LCD display will crack (HP sent me a refurb because this happened very early on during my ownership of the camera) and (b) you want pictures taken with the flash to be properly exposed.  They're consistently, staggeringly underexposed, not usable.  If you handle the camera as if you were carrying an egg and don't want to take pictures where the flash is required, this is a nice camera.<br /><br />Also, avoid the HP M-series Quick Recharge kit, which includes a case (nice enough), and a charger with 4 AA NiMH batteries (2 batteries required for the camera).  The batteries charge quickly - well under an hour - and discharge even faster, within 20 minutes of use.  Mine came with \"Powerex\" branded rechargeable batteries made by Maha Energy Corp USA and exhibited this fast discharge time out of the box.  There are probably better batteries out there and a generic camera case will do you.<br /><br />I'm disappointed - I own a lot of HP products and think HP is a great company, but they missed the mark on a few major details with this item.","Use digital camera batteries or the rechargeable camera batteries and quit whining that digital cameras eat batteries!  Standard batteries are not meant for digital cameras. Left on, the LCD will also lesson battery life.<br /><br />My family gets decent, clear pictures with good color from this camera -- that I bought for for one of my kids for $80.  My son has taken many pictures of his friends -- many indoors at his school and none of those pics are blurred or out of focus. The prints are very nice as well.<br /><br />I bought the camera on a whim because of the price.  I'm glad I did not read the reviews before purchase or I might not have taken that chance even for $80!  We were pleasantly surprised with our results and decided to keep the camera.<br /><br />The menu is intuitive and fun.  This camera has a small internal memory.  I have never had an internal memory in a digital camera before as my other cameras only have a removable memory card option.  The internal memory was kind of sweet!<br /><br />Also, I like that we can use regular batteries because we can pop in the regular ones if in a pinch (although it is obvious those will not last long in any digital camera).<br /><br />Movies are okay to good if your lighting is good - or if you are outdoors - but this camera had not faired as well with night shots.<br /><br />This is an entry level camera and it can provide decent pictures but may not be for everyone.  The picture quality seems to falter when using the digital zoom so we use this camera mainly for point and shoot pictures.  I have had a few decent pics with zoom but not many, it is hard.  It was inexpensive enough that I don't worry about my kids taking it everywhere and reliable enough that everyone is happy with their results.  We made a few 8x10 prints that were very nice so I know this camera can do that.<br /><br />I recently used this camera at a party because I forgot my camera and my son had his...this one!  ALL of my shots were very good.  Normally, I use an 8MP digital SLR which is not a comparable camera by any means and I was still happy with the HP results.  As a point and shoot, it is fine but I wouldn't want to pay more than $80 for this camera.","I recently had the chance to use this camera for a day at Sea World Orlando.  Based upon my experience with several other cameras in this category here is my review:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1)  Excellent zoom from such a small camera.<br /><br />2)  Records MPEG video, makes DVD authoring easier.<br /><br />3)  Digital zoom is also very good.<br /><br />4)  Camera can be carried in the pocket all day with no damage to it's rugged frame.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1)  Consumes batteries.  I had to replace the 2xAA batteries twice on a day trip to Sea World with a single 128Mb photo card!<br /><br />2)  While taking pictures of a Sea World show, the shutter lag felt like almost a second behind.  This caused several shots to loose the subject entirely.<br /><br />Note:  If you are looking for a good primary camera, consider the Olympus 3040Z  or 4040Z.","Hewlett Packard Photosmart M407 is a nice little digital camera that is small enough to fit inside your pants pocket. This camera is one of the best buys around among cameras with greater than 4 megepixels and while there are better cameras on the market, this is a very nice one for the money.<br /><br />My favorite qualities of this camera are its size, its ease of use, and its sharp resolution. Pictures can be taken in VGA (lowest quality) or in 2 MP or 4MP resolution. These higher resolutions are going to eat up more memory but they produce sharp, clear photos. For everyday picture taking, I have found the VGA to be just fine, but for someone who is more experienced as a photographer, the 4 MP setting is needed to produce the sharpest images. The ones you get with this camera at that resolution level are very good, but you need to keep in mind that the memory (without buying a memory card) is capable of storing only about 10 images at this level. Lower the quality to VGA, and you can store about 160 images.<br /><br />Some of the disadvantages of this camera include its video capabilities and the placement of certain buttons and controls. The video is offered with an MPEG format and it produces images at 30 frames per second. Its quality isn't very good and I recommend it only to people who really need/want to take a video and have no other alternative. I don't like the placement of the video and picture shutters on the top of the camera either. The picture button is larger than the video shutter, like it should be since it is used more frequently. But the picture shutter is placed to the left of the video shutter on the top of the camera. The picture shutter is used more and it should be on the right side because, to most people, your instinct is to press the button furthest to the right. I cannot count the number of times I have accidentally pressed the video button by mistake.<br /><br />This camera comes with batteries, two USB cables, a strap, a user manual, and HP image software. This software is nice because it helps new photographers organize pictures and upload them into a pc. The other additions are expected with a digital camera but they help aid in the usability of this electronic device.<br /><br />Overall, HP Photosmart is a good digital camera for the money and it is one of the few that offers more than 4 megapixels at such a low price. It was the first digital camera I ever purchased and I haven't regretted making the buying decision.","The good part about this cameral.<br /><br />*Not to much $$$<br /><br />*Greats on prints that are smaller than 20x30<br /><br />*The manual book is built-in to the cameral. So no longer do you have to filp through books.<br /><br />* Tech support was fast.<br /><br />* supports many different other different languages.<br /><br />* You can connect drectly to your printer... IF it suppots pictbridge or HP instant share<br /><br />* very simple to use<br /><br />-------------------------------------------<br /><br />The bad part about this cameral.<br /><br />* You have to use lithium or NiMH batterys. Alkaline batterys only gives you 4 shots.<br /><br />* some pictures are a bit darker than usuall.<br /><br />* Not a great idea to bring to the beach or almost any were. My cameral got sand into the lens and the moving parts inside. So when I ever turn it on, you will hear a cracking nosies. Also, after a few hits on the ground the screws starts to comeout. HP said that they can't replace the screws because they said they don't make the screws.<br /><br />*Not compatiable with other HP hardware like my HP scanjet 4600,and HP Laserjet 3015. But they did reless updates for that problems.<br /><br />* There is no battery indicator. They only show when the battery is very low.<br /><br />* They install too many differnt othere HP software that I dont need.<br /><br />* No speakers for you to listen back your viedos.<br /><br />* The resolution of the viedos are horriable.<br /><br />* We don't need 3 flash in one picture, do we?<br /><br />* A bit more thick than you expected from the pictures.<br /><br />* This a big battery sucker even if you use rechargeable or lithium batterys.<br /><br />* you have to buy there HP dock to watch your viedos on the tv (which will cost you about $50) note: the dock charges the battery very slowly, so go to radio shack and buy your self a fast charger.<br /><br />* the mic. hardly picks up anything<br /><br />* no steady shot if your hands are shacking so much from you freazing.<br /><br />* i dont really use instant share because ink is just too expensive. Thats why I have a laser printer. But my pictures are only black and white. So thats why I send them to Snapfish and tell them to print them. Only 12 cents per print, can't beat that.<br /><br />Overall I give this a 4 because HP tech support does help in a language that you ACTUALLY understand. The cameral is very simple for anyone to use even if you don't speak engulish. A lot of your problems can be soved by just going to hp support web site.","I picked up this camera and a memory card for under $150.  I was looking for a low cost camera to document a project.  This camera is doing a great job.<br /><br />The original (lithium) batteries are just about spent after 2 months (548 pictures).  Lithium batteries last much longer than alkaline or rechargeables.<br /><br />Photo quality is comparable to an older Olympus digital camera that I used to use.","It is a easy camera, it is not complicate, the share option is excellent: with this option you can send  pictures for a lot your friends without having to attach the pictures, it is a great camera.","this is the first digital camera i have ever owned (besides my camera phone Samsung a670) and i am very happy with it.<br /><br />The buttons are very well placed and easty to use. The name on the button is the name of the function, very nice.<br /><br />The screen on this baby is huge!!!1.8 inches to be exact!!<br /><br />The camera takes movies with audio, but ypu can't actually hear audio on the camera, you have to download the movie to your computer.<br /><br />The software to upload pics is VERY easy to use. All you have to do is first before you do anything else is put the CD in. Then you can connect the cord to the computer. Make sure the camera is off (or else it won'yt connect) and then connect the other side of the cord to the camera. Many pics can be downloaded in a matter of moments.<br /><br />The camera features auto flash, macro mode, portrait mode ( it will focus on the person you are taking a pic of and blur the backround), snow and beach mode, landscape mode, auto mode, and many other things.<br /><br />The camera also features 16MB internal memory (w/o memory card) whitch will store about 9 pics on the highest setting, and 150 at the lowest. The difference between the highest resololution setting and the lowest is not even noticible. I don't think i'll ever need a memory card!<br /><br />The only bad things are that a battery recharger is not included, you have to buy it through HP. Anothere thing is that you can not hear audio from movies you make on the camera itself. The last thing is that the movie mode is kind of blurry.<br /><br />This camera is awesome because it is even BETTER by featuring an 1.8 inch LCD screen and instant share than my friend's $250.00 Sony Cybershot.<br /><br />I am 13 yrs. old and i hope to have this AWESOME camera for many years to come. I LOVE IT!!!!","I got this camera as an upgrade to a very low resolution digital camera/VHSC video camera combo.  We love it, although I did lose a bunch of pictures from my son's first Christmas.  After doing some research, I think that was the fault of the SD card we were using (SanDisk).<br /><br />There is a slight (a second or less) lag time between the time you click and the time the pic is taken, as is true with most digital cameras in this range.  Not a problem at all if you plan for it.  I have small children and pets, and I missed as many shots with this camera as I did with my very fast film camera.<br /><br />It's very compact, and contrary to what others have said, I got it with everything that's \"in the box.\"  Maybe because I got it from another retailer.  I do wish, however, that the camera came with a bag.  I had to buy that separately.<br /><br />All in all, the camera is a VERY good deal for the price!","Here are the great features of this camera:<br /><br /> * Easy for point and shoot.<br /><br /> * Very light and small!  It easily fits in your pocket.<br /><br /> * Great full color LCD viewscreen and easy to understand buttons.<br /><br /> * Wonderful shutter button and \"video record\" buttons (some cameras require you to twist knobs, pull levers and shift gears to go from picture taking to video recording, this camera makes it a snap!)<br /><br /> * Video Recording will fill up all the space you have.  With a 1GB SD card, it will record nearly 90 minutes of video.  The video is decent quality (the QVGA 30fps mpeg) and has allowed us to stop taking the bulky 8mm video camera along with us.  With Windows Movie Maker software, we can easily mix still photos and live videos for sharing with friends on the web or burn to DVD.  It is NOT digital video recorder quality (or even an 8mm) but when you are juggling the kids, keys, diaper bags, towels, and everything else, if you can eliminate a camera and still have the functionality, life is good!<br /><br />Our first digital camera was an HP Photosmart 735.  We purchased the M407 as a replacement.  The price and features seemed to make it equal with the 735 but with some enhancements.  However, that is not entirely true.<br /><br />* Strange as it may seem, the 4 MB Best selection doesn't seem to produce the same crystal clear vibrant colors that the 3.2 megapixel 735 did.  The flash seems to make this even worse.<br /><br />* The camera does not have a speaker.  It has a mic to record video and audio-over, but you can't play it back and listen to it.  You must transfer it to your computer.  The 735 came with a built in speaker which made it a great way to check audio quality as well as the picture.  I am sad that HP didn't continue that with this camera.<br /><br />* As with the 735, you still can't operate the zoom when you are recording.  This is annoying, but you can work around it.  Zoom before you start video recording and it will record at that zoom level (just remember that you can't change it until you stop recording).<br /><br />* The video recording sound is a little soft.  The 735 had an aggressive auto level control that often went overboard, but you never missed audio.  The M407 gives \"cleaner\" audio but at the cost of low levels.  I don't know what is best.<br /><br />*  HP eliminated the simple LCD screen that was on the top of the 735 camera that would show the number of pictures left (or minutes left for video recording) which was a nice feature but not critical.<br /><br />* The view finder is very small and you will probably use the LCD screen instead to frame your shots.  The screen is a bit slow (as with other HP cameras).<br /><br />Overall, it is an excellent camera for the money, but don't expect to see it as an upgrade from the older 3.2M 735 model.","This is my first digital camera and I couldn't be happier.  The price is low and it is EXTREMELY user friendly.  5 minutes after taking it out of the box I was taking pictures with ease without even reading the manual. It is also fairly simple to download and send pictures since it is an HP product.  I did not even have to install the software onto my PC for it to work.  The picture quality is excellent and with the 128MB card I purchased with it, it takes about 100 pictures.  I highly recommend this camera to other newbies or people who just want a simple to use product."]},{"name":"HP Photosmart R607","amazon_reviews":["I bought this camera more than three years ago and have been using it ever since. I'm not the kind of person that takes pictures all the time, but enjoy taking pictures during trips and family/friends reunions. What decided me to buy the R607 were its low price (very cheap in comparison with similar cameras at the time) and my previous experience with HP products (I own a HP desktop, a HP laptop, a HP PDA...).<br /><br />Regarding to this camera, it takes excellent pictures. I love the panorama function for taking landscape photos. 4MP is more than enough for a non-professional photographer. It has a lot of functions that I didn't use too often, but many could find useful. It can fit a cheap, very compatible SD memory card to improve its capacity.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it has some downsides. First of all, the LCD display is quite small. You can get used to it, but since newer cameras come with larger displays, you can be tempted to go that way instead. The software has given me some headaches lately, but I suspect I could fix the bugs reinstalling it from the beginning.  And the battery endurance has started to show some shortfall, but I think its normal after 3+ years of continued use.<br /><br />Overall I'm very satisfied with the camera's performance. Now its time for me to buy a new one, and I'll stick to HP for that.","This was my first camera I've owned and I wanted one to take pictures of my friends at school as well as scenery. Due to the camera's compact size I can carry with me everywhere I go. It has many options but I usually keep it on auto and I get great results. The main standout point for me was the HP Adaptive Light Tech. feature. It is made to bring faces out of shadows and details out of backgrounds which makes the picture look 100 times better. I put one of my images of Lake Dixon in the customer images section if you want to see just how good these pictures turn out. If your thinking of buying a camera at a reasonable price, one you can take anywhere, and still take great pictures, this is the camera for you! I love it!","I have owned an R607 for a few months now. (I purchased one of the limited edition 'Gwen Stefani - Harajuku Lovers' cameras, but that doesn't make much of a difference) I'm very pleased with it but there are a few things that miff me.<br /><br />For one, even in medium light, sometimes it will take very long to take a picture if you're not using flash.  Sometimes you have to hold your hand/arm/body very, very still - usually someone would buy a tripod for this, but it even happens when simply doing a quick shot of a few friends on an outing or something. I practice holding my breath and keeping very still when taking pictures with this camera. (And sometimes it's awkward when someone poses for the camera and they have to stay still for 10-15 or even 20 seconds.)<br /><br />The audio quality of the video mode is absolutely horrible. All you hear is loud static. It's very hard to capture any sound at all and when you do it's nearly drowned out by the static.<br /><br />But there are many good things about this camera as well. First of all, the design. Although it has a small screen, it's no big deal. It's tiny enough to take anywhere with you but not fragile.<br /><br />There are different macro settings which can produce gorgeous pictures with lots of detail. It has 'Image Advice' - a little notification thing that pops up every once in a while to tell you how you might improve a picture.<br /><br />There are many different modes - sunset, portrait, beach, snow... there's even a panoramic mode that allows you to take large, wide pictures of landscapes or other things like that. It has different colours; B&W and Sepia. You can adjust the hue and sharpness and exposure and all sorts of things. There is red-eye removal right on the menu and an automatic printing function - select the number of prints you want on your camera and hook it up to a special HP printer and you get professional pictures right from your camera.<br /><br />It has an InstantShare feature as well, which, when set up, allows you to send your pictures off to different people on your contact list immediately when you hook up your camera to your computer.<br /><br />So, for what it is, it's a spectacular camera - if you can settle with it's drawbacks. A tiny screen isn't much of a deal, right? I thoroughly enjoy using this camera and I'm going to continue using it for a long time to come.","I just got this camera- and I am amazed. I was hesitent about buying something other than Olympus- a name brand I could trust (I previously owned a D-390) but I am impressed by the quality of this camera. The pictures are sharp and crisp and HPs adaptive lighting will brighten the dark areas of the picture.<br /><br />Its very portable and it only took me 2 1/2 seconds for it to completly turn on and take a picture. HP really packed a lot of features into this camera.<br /><br />The only minor downsides are the speaker isnt great but when you put them on a computer, its great. Also there is 2second delay after you press the movie button before it starts recording.<br /><br />BUY THIS CAMERA ITS GREAT","If you want a reasonably priced yet still very good digital camera, this is it. I'm very pleasantly surprised by this purchase. and it's so tiny...fits perfectly in your pocket! easy to use. definitely recommended. one tip...buy a large memory card to take advantage of the video features, etc.","Is it crass to be in love with an electronic device? I'm so enamoured of my new camera that my husband is starting to wonder.<br /><br />I previously liked my refurbished HP Photosmart 635 2.1 MP because the menus were so easy to use and the photos were fine for 2.1.  Our daughter wanted an inexpensive digital camera which was my excuse to upgrade to something smaller.  I finally opted for another HP and purchased the R607 from Amazon (great price and free shipping) and I love this little thing.  It's very small (maybe about the size of a slim pack of cigarettes?) but feels great to hold (well designed rubbery material on the back) and it's packed full of features.  The menus are still incredibly easy to use right off the bat, although there are many settings which can be customized to maximize the quality of different types of shots.  The rechargeable lithium battery life is excellent, AND it's replaceable with the new CP-1 disposable from Duracell if you're going where you won't be able to recharge!  Takes SD or MMC but in a flash-card emergency, the built-in 16MB becomes available as a backup.  As for quality, I took several close-up shots of my favorite Magnolia Stellata in full bloom this spring, and I thought they were absolutely stunning.  The compact owner's manual is full of information about using the many different settings to get the most from your shots - I'll have to get around to doing that some day, but in the meantime, I'm just having fun.","I've had this camera for about a month now and I've had so much fun with it.<br /><br />The first great thing about it was the price, I got it for a very reasonable price of 199 euros - my package included the leather pouch and one 128 Mb SD-card.<br /><br />I've had HP products before so I knew I could expect high quality combined with easy usability. Pictures turn out very nice as I like to have the Adaptive Lighting option on all the time. I've taken some beautifully artistic black and white and sepia photos as well. The camera really is good for every day use, from quick snapshots in the park to detailed still-life pics with a tripod, for instance.<br /><br />The only thing not so great is the sound quality, but if I wanted to take video clips I'd buy a proper video camera anyway.<br /><br />And as the camera is small and light, I can have it with me all the time. I've had more use of it already than of my traditional SLR camera that I bought three years ago!<br /><br />(If I understood correctly, one of the previous reviewers had got a virus on his/her camera. Well, one can't really blame that on the camera since the bug definitely came from somewhere else. That's just the price you pay for being careless yourself. Sorry!)","I bought this camera more than three years ago and have been using it ever since.

The software has given me some headaches lately, but I suspect I could fix the bugs reinstalling it from the beginning.  And the battery endurance has started to show some shortfall, but I think its normal after 3+ years of continued use.<br /><br />Overall I'm very satisfied with the camera's performance. Now its time for me to buy a new one, and I'll stick to HP for that.","This was my first camera I've owned and I wanted one to take pictures of my friends at school as well as scenery. Due to the camera's compact size I can carry with me everywhere I go. It has many options but I usually keep it on auto and I get great results. The main standout point for me was the HP Adaptive Light Tech. feature. It is made to bring faces out of shadows and details out of backgrounds which makes the picture look 100 times better. I put one of my images of Lake Dixon in the customer images section if you want to see just how good these pictures turn out. If your thinking of buying a camera at a reasonable price, one you can take anywhere, and still take great pictures, this is the camera for you! I love it!","I have owned an R607 for a few months now. (I purchased one of the limited edition 'Gwen Stefani - Harajuku Lovers' cameras, but that doesn't make much of a difference) I'm very pleased with it but there are a few things that miff me.<br /><br />For one, even in medium light, sometimes it will take very long to take a picture if you're not using flash.  Sometimes you have to hold your hand/arm/body very, very still - usually someone would buy a tripod for this, but it even happens when simply doing a quick shot of a few friends on an outing or something. I practice holding my breath and keeping very still when taking pictures with this camera. (And sometimes it's awkward when someone poses for the camera and they have to stay still for 10-15 or even 20 seconds.)<br /><br />The audio quality of the video mode is absolutely horrible. All you hear is loud static. It's very hard to capture any sound at all and when you do it's nearly drowned out by the static.<br /><br />But there are many good things about this camera as well. First of all, the design. Although it has a small screen, it's no big deal. It's tiny enough to take anywhere with you but not fragile.<br /><br />There are different macro settings which can produce gorgeous pictures with lots of detail. It has 'Image Advice' - a little notification thing that pops up every once in a while to tell you how you might improve a picture.<br /><br />There are many different modes - sunset, portrait, beach, snow... there's even a panoramic mode that allows you to take large, wide pictures of landscapes or other things like that. It has different colours; B&W and Sepia. You can adjust the hue and sharpness and exposure and all sorts of things. There is red-eye removal right on the menu and an automatic printing function - select the number of prints you want on your camera and hook it up to a special HP printer and you get professional pictures right from your camera.<br /><br />It has an InstantShare feature as well, which, when set up, allows you to send your pictures off to different people on your contact list immediately when you hook up your camera to your computer.<br /><br />So, for what it is, it's a spectacular camera - if you can settle with it's drawbacks. A tiny screen isn't much of a deal, right? I thoroughly enjoy using this camera and I'm going to continue using it for a long time to come.","I just got this camera- and I am amazed. I was hesitent about buying something other than Olympus- a name brand I could trust (I previously owned a D-390) but I am impressed by the quality of this camera. The pictures are sharp and crisp and HPs adaptive lighting will brighten the dark areas of the picture.<br /><br />Its very portable and it only took me 2 1/2 seconds for it to completly turn on and take a picture. HP really packed a lot of features into this camera.<br /><br />The only minor downsides are the speaker isnt great but when you put them on a computer, its great. Also there is 2second delay after you press the movie button before it starts recording.<br /><br />BUY THIS CAMERA ITS GREAT","If you want a reasonably priced yet still very good digital camera, this is it. I'm very pleasantly surprised by this purchase. and it's so tiny...fits perfectly in your pocket! easy to use. definitely recommended. one tip...buy a large memory card to take advantage of the video features, etc.","Is it crass to be in love with an electronic device? I'm so enamoured of my new camera that my husband is starting to wonder.<br /><br />I previously liked my refurbished HP Photosmart 635 2.1 MP because the menus were so easy to use and the photos were fine for 2.1.  Our daughter wanted an inexpensive digital camera which was my excuse to upgrade to something smaller.  I finally opted for another HP and purchased the R607 from Amazon (great price and free shipping) and I love this little thing.  It's very small (maybe about the size of a slim pack of cigarettes?) but feels great to hold (well designed rubbery material on the back) and it's packed full of features.  The menus are still incredibly easy to use right off the bat, although there are many settings which can be customized to maximize the quality of different types of shots.  The rechargeable lithium battery life is excellent, AND it's replaceable with the new CP-1 disposable from Duracell if you're going where you won't be able to recharge!  Takes SD or MMC but in a flash-card emergency, the built-in 16MB becomes available as a backup.  As for quality, I took several close-up shots of my favorite Magnolia Stellata in full bloom this spring, and I thought they were absolutely stunning.  The compact owner's manual is full of information about using the many different settings to get the most from your shots - I'll have to get around to doing that some day, but in the meantime, I'm just having fun.","I've had this camera for about a month now and I've had so much fun with it.<br /><br />The first great thing about it was the price, I got it for a very reasonable price of 199 euros - my package included the leather pouch and one 128 Mb SD-card.<br /><br />I've had HP products before so I knew I could expect high quality combined with easy usability. Pictures turn out very nice as I like to have the Adaptive Lighting option on all the time. I've taken some beautifully artistic black and white and sepia photos as well. The camera really is good for every day use, from quick snapshots in the park to detailed still-life pics with a tripod, for instance.<br /><br />The only thing not so great is the sound quality, but if I wanted to take video clips I'd buy a proper video camera anyway.<br /><br />And as the camera is small and light, I can have it with me all the time. I've had more use of it already than of my traditional SLR camera that I bought three years ago!<br /><br />(If I understood correctly, one of the previous reviewers had got a virus on his/her camera. Well, one can't really blame that on the camera since the bug definitely came from somewhere else. That's just the price you pay for being careless yourself. Sorry!)","Like most companies these days, forget about the advertised rebates - send in the info, get the run around, spend lots of time and get no satifaction. HP has really gone down hill over the past 5 years in terms of customer service.  If they dont want to pay the rebate, why promo it to begin with - just sell a quality product at a fair price - that's what they used to do.","I have had this camera for almost a year and I am happy and disappointed as I get pictures from it that I want but don't need and then when I went to Warped Tour this summer and finally met Lars from my favorite punk band I went to get it developed and magically I got a virus and it deleted my pictures.  I found out it thinks it has a virus if you have movies with pictures!  And will just delete everything!  I have not used the movie function since as it uses too much memory anyways.  I have had okay luck since then but it still is only worth its money!  I had a cannon 5.1 megapixel with 5 normal zoom and 5 digital and it was great but it was also costly and I couldn't afford the bill at the time so I returned it for this one.  And I can tell a difference, better price, better camera.  But if you look  some are worse than this one but cost more.  My advise never use movies with a picture as that is what caused the virus on my camera according to what HP told Walmart when they called to see if they could save my pictures.  I don't want anyone to lose pictures that mean a lot like I did.","My wife got me the 607 for Christmas and It has been great.  The battery lasts a long time.  It is quick to start up and take pictures.  I really like the way it shows you the last part of your last picture on the side of the screen so you can position you camera perfectly for great panorama shots.  The image advice feature is making me an expert by telling me how to improve almost any shot.  It is like having the manual built in to the camera.  I have printed a lot of the pictures and some of my friends have said that they wished their cameras  could take pictures as good as mine.  (Their new cameras cost more than twice as much)I am pretty happy.","Is a great camera for the price and is really small and stylish, the image quality is good, comes with great options and easy to use.<br /><br />My rating...<br /><br />Camera Size: 5/5<br /><br />The right size for your pocket<br /><br />LCD Screen: 4.5/5<br /><br />Small but beautiful<br /><br />Menu: 5/5<br /><br />Easy and fast, very intuitive<br /><br />Easy to Use: 5/5<br /><br />Fool proof :)<br /><br />Internal Features: 5/5<br /><br />Great built-in options<br /><br />External Features: 4/5<br /><br />TV-Out would be a great option in the camera and not as a separate option with the HP Dock<br /><br />Battery Life: 4/5<br /><br />Good battery life, long time to recharge unless you got the Rapid Charger<br /><br />Image Quality: 3.5/5<br /><br />Is good but some pictures come out with noises or blurry, the image quality could be improved a bit but for the price I think is right","I purchased this camera for a trip that I was taking in December.  I shopped around and was originally favoring the Cannon A75 which has received numerous excellent reviews.  What drew me to this one was a very small size, great body design, and the fact that it was 4.1 MP whereas the Cannon was only 3.2 MP.  The biggest problem I had when trying to convince myself to purchase this camera was the lack of online reviews.<br /><br />As previously stated in another customer's review, the body design is great.  The back of the camera has a rubberlike texture which feels great when snapping shots.  The menus are very easy to use, and very important to myself, the instruction manual is written in such a way that it is very easy to lean how to use all of the features on your new toy!  Huge plus for me, is the battery.  This camera uses a small rechargeable battery, not regular AA or AAA.  This battery holds charge for a good amount of time and was a major plus for me, especially considering all of the reviews complaining about how others cameras drain batteries at a very rapid pace.<br /><br />Probably the biggest reason I bought this camera is the panorama mode.  Many cameras have this feature, but the way that it works on this particular camera is absolutely amazing, with each subsequent shot becoming \"transparent\" allowing you to line up the next shot in the panorama.  They look great, I have one posted on this page.<br /><br />All in all, I really like this camera.  I have posted some shots that are very basic, but allow others to see what this small camera can do!  The small things make this camera really cool.  I took a vertical shot where I turned the camera vertically and snapped the picture.  The sensor in the camera recognized this and stored the photo in the correct orientation in its memory.  My friend who purchased a 3.2 MP Nikon turned to me and said, \"I wish my camera did that...\"","Just got this camera a couple of days ago.  I liked the camera because it was lightweight and compact.  I have a 35mm Nikon and wanted a smaller camera to carry around for on the spot picture taking.  Decided to go digital.  The picture quality on this cameria is clear and crisp.  I especially like the Adaptive Lighting feature where the camera balances the lighting across the whole picture.<br /><br />It has great video capabilities with smooth streaming.  The remove red eye feature is also a plus and works well.<br /><br />The camera is very easy to use with an intuitive menu system.  Finally, I really like the look a feel with the silver face and rubberized back.  I would definitely recommend this camera.  It was definitely the best buy for the quality and price."]},{"name":"Casio Exilim EX-Z50","amazon_reviews":["Great little first time camera.

While in the store, I noticed the excess of noise on the LCD screen, which I had never experienced with my Sony. I, nonetheless, purchased it anyway after the test photos I snapped appeared to be clear on the LCD screen.

It takes minutes to download 50 ++ pictures. It is very, very easy to use. I have taken this small camera everywhere; Italy, Switzerland and France, and my own backyard.  This camera has made me a better photographer(see images). It has performed perfectly for me and the only assesory I've purchased is a bigger memory card (1 gig) for $29.00. It is so small, I keep it in my purse most of the time.<br /><br />Sure, you'll need a larger camera for telephoto, and wide angle but for the size, this packs a punch.<br /><br />BUY IT!  You will not be dissapointed.","I'm very pleased with this camera.  Had a lot of features, the res. is excelent and is very small and light.","Although I'm not the best photogragher...this camera is amazing to use and produces very clear vivid digital pictures and is a pleasure to use.  The compact look makes for easy traveling convenience.  I love it!","I bought this camera in 2005 and liked it so much that I purchased an additional camera for my husband for his business. I like the larger screen, it was easy to learn to use and the pictures come out great. My only complaint is that if its dark its hard to see the screen when taking the picture. You do have to use a docking station but if we travel we can both bring our cameras and just one docking station.Make sure you buy a Sandisk digital card for storage- 256 should be fine holds 80-100 pictures.  Overall I am thrilled with the camera.","This product is GREAT! Samlll size but all the features of a larger camera, and the price at Amazon can not be BEAT!<br /><br />No wonder NIkon announced they are no londer making \"film camera's\", this was a gift for my daughter who wanted a small camera, I did the techincal review and this is the \"camera\".<br /><br />Every family should own at least one!<br /><br />Things just keep getting better.<br /><br />A Best Buy here at Amazon, only regret they did not carry the camera in other colors, such as some other retailers did.","I love this camera.  Easy to use and understand. Has a long battery life.  Very little lag time between pictures.  Its a great little camera.  I have one and just purchased one for my granddaughter. Very fast shipping.  Ordered it Sunday evening, and had it Tues. afternoon.","Tons of features, good battery life, slim but very functional packaging.  The only downside I have found so far is that the instruction manual doesn't provide much information on the myriad of features - disapointing to have all the bells and whistles and not have the supporting information to go with them.  All in all though, this camera is simply wonderful and has met all my performance expectations and needs.","I was especially excited about receiving this camera.  I had looked for a digital camera for some time and loved the compact size and large screen that this one provided.  I had it for about 8 months when I went on my honeymoon in Hawaii.  I had not used it for that amount of consecutive time prior to this trip but of course was taking many shots of the scenery.  The camera started malfunctioning and locking up and not saving the picture that it locked up on.  This of course happened at very inopportune times and had to be reset many times as well, sometimes effectively and sometimes not.  I would say buyer be scared, especially if you are planning to use it a lot for one type of important event.  It probably was worth spending more money and getting a better name brand. The size of the lcd screen is great, however the quality of the pictures could be better.  Although you can change the picture quality size, a size for normal pictures that you would get is not included such as 4x6 and 8x10.  It does have a 5x7 size though.","This is a slim, easy to carry and use camera.  Memory, resolution and zoom is more than acceptable for casual user.  Battery life is perfect.  SD memory type fits the slot I have in my Toshiba Laptop, but I never had to take the SD memory-stick out because the docking station is a breeze to use.<br /><br />Super Fast Startup and battery life are the main plus.  Do not buy a digital camara that uses AA or AAA batteries, is a waste of money. You dont have to worry about this with the Casio Exilim.","Strengths: Excellent pictures with outside lighting<br /><br />Weaknesses: Red Eye reduction doesn't seem to work at all. Night photos of fireworks didn't work well even when using that setting. Any pics you take inside with low lighting are very grainy. Nice size camera for a woman~~too small for a mans hands.<br /><br />Summary: I've had the camera for 8 months now and was very satisfied with any of the outside pictures or pictures that had a great deal of lighting around to compensate for the basic lack of a flash ~ the flash doesn't really help unless you are on top of the subject. Inside pics in dimly lit areas are very very grainy and I have tried every setting to improve them with absolutely no luck. The camera comes with different settings, but even when I put the camera on the firework setting all of the fireworks came out blurry. The size of the camera is great for a woman with small hands but is awkward for a mans larger hands. The casing is very flimsy and was dented when accidently dropped about 4 ft from the ground (height you would hold a camera at while taking a pic) while my husband was taking a pic of my daughter. The lens which protrudes while taking a pic would also no longer retract into the camera with this very small accident. BEWARE ~~ if you drop the camera plan on buying a new one. Casio charged me a FLAT FEE of $200 plus other small fees. Total charge to repair camera $220.43. I requested that the camera be sent back without repairs so they couldn't reuse my perfectly good lens or reuse the battery or any other good parts and there is a shipping fee to return the camera. By the way, a new camera from many dealers on-line costs somewhere between $229 and $259.<br /><br />As stated earlier the camera works very well in good lighting situations ~~ poorly in dimly lit situations. The only reason that I would not consider purchasing this camera again is due to the unfortunate way that Casio sticks you with a super high repair bill.","I just bought this camera recently and it is incredible. It takes superior quality pictures inside and out, and is so small you can easily carry it in the smallest purse or your pocket. I love how it has the \"BESTSHOT\" feature where you can choose many preset photo option such as a coupling shot where you can combine two pictures into one and create 'twins' and two headed people. Also, it has 3 settings for the quality of the pictures and even the \"economy\" setting takes incredible shots. I have gotten so many compliments on this camera its not even funny. people come up to me all the time and ask where i got that kind of money to buy an $800. camera and they are in shock when i tell them it was only about $300. or so. This camera is worth  every single penny...don't even bother to compare to other cameras because i'm telling you now, this camera is the best you'll ever find, anywhere!!","The Z50 has an instantaneous startup time and the docking station is kinda cool.  It's pocket-sized with a nice size LCD, though not as big as the cybershot T1.  The snapshot feature seems to work the best because it doesn't manipulate/distort the image as much as the \"best shot\" feature, an ironic name for such BS camera modes.<br /><br />The categories for \"best shot\" are way too specific: Children, Fireworks, Flowers, Collection, Food, ect.  I don't take enough picture of food to have a specific setting on my camera for that.  The categories should have been like: indoor, outdoor, action, slow shutter-speed and stuff like that - keep it general.  I find myself taking multiple pictures of the same thing in different camera modes because I don't know which ones will turn out crappy.  Portraits and coupling shots are actually designed to blur the background, but the camera rarely distinguishes the foreground from the background correctly.<br /><br />If you can find the right picture mode for your shots, the camera can be worth the price.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't buy this camera again.  But I wouldn't discourage others from trying it.","This camera rocks the house!  It's small and takes great photos.  The battery life is long.  It's not complicated to use.  It's not heavy.  The pictures look good and are in focus!  BUY THIS CAMERA!","There are fancier camperas with more features. There are slicker-looking cameras. They are all big. This camera can hide under a credit card yet it takes fabulous pix and even avi video. The software is even adequate for manipulating photos although an Adobe Photo package makes this camera come to life. Load it up with memory, crank the resolution and sharpness to max and go on a shooting spree with this camera. I used one for five days including video shoots, playback and lots of start/stop and the battery still shows a full charge. It's simply amazing for its size. Yes there are better cameras which cost more and are the size of a Nikon F3 but for a tiny camera, this one rocks.","I have never owned a better camera. I was delighted by the design and performance of the exilim. Only one issue, that of the birghtness of the screen in dark situations, pales in comparison to the speed, battery life and overall quality. I wanted a compact, high quality, functionally superior camera - the exilim is all that an more. I just love it.","I hate to sound like one of those grumpy guys who says \"this camera is no better than the brand XX I bought 3 years ago\" but it's true!  I REALLY wanted to like this camera for all it's nifty features, but at the end of the day, picture quality was no better (and sometimes worse) than my old 3mp sony cybershot p7.  Here's the scoop<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Great size/ body.  Looks awesome and feels solid.  Nice grip placement.<br /><br />2. Menu system is the BEST I have ever seen.  REally intuitive, easy to get to all the settings.<br /><br />3. 23 shooting modes!  And there is an example for each, you don't have to memorize what all the cryptic symbols mean<br /><br />4. Start up is very fast.  This is where the casio kicks butt over my old camera.<br /><br />4. DECENT photo quality, but...<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. ... Picture quality is simply not as good as my 3mp Sony.  I tried every setting there is and took lots of comparison photos... day, night, macro, magnifying, using different sizes and enhancing them.  Bottom line: more noise and less sharpness with the Casio.  It's more megapixels, it should be sharper, no?  I have no explanation.<br /><br />2. LCD is big, but it is VERY grainy in low lighting conditions.  Embarassing.  My sony has a smaller screen, but it's not snowing all the time.<br /><br />For me, the picture quality is the deciding factor.  For others, it might not matter... The Casio certainly takes VERY decent photos, and I can't see how anyone could give it a \"poor\" rating.  But I'll stick with my beat up sony, thanks!","I've used it a lot... I just can say that this is a great device...  The quality of the pictures are very good... The size is perfect... I really recommend this camera.","Although I did not buy this camera from Amazon (found it cheaper elsewhere and paid for that in customer service) I felt compelled to write a review here since it will likely get the most exposure at this website.<br /><br />I have had this camera for 2 weeks now and I am absolutely thrilled with it.  I bought it originally for two features -- the 5MP resolution and the size of the item itself.  The pictures are great and look like they would easily lend themselves to enlargement without a loss in clarity.  The camera easily stows away in the pocket of your pants and it's like it is not even there.<br /><br />PROS - small size/portability; 5MP resolution with the ability to set resolution at 5, 4.28, 3, 1.875, 1.2, and 0.5 MP; movie mode which records movies as long as you have memory; voice recording as long as you have memory; picture/voice mode allows you to place a 30 second voice caption onto your pictures; ability to manually set f-stop, shutter speed, focus, whitebalance, electron volts; can zoom and crop images right on the camera; up and ready to take a picture in <2 seconds, 3x optical zoom, controls very intuitive, 2 inch LCD screen large and clear<br /><br />CONS - images grainy in low light (what camera isn't?), SD card slightly difficult to remove from camera, voice recorder doesn't record clearly when input is very loud, 4x digital zoom does not keep image clarity very well<br /><br />EXTRA SPECIAL PRO - battery life (I have taken over 200 pictures with flash on 70, two video clips of 1 and 5 minutes, and a voice clip of 10 minutes and the battery indicator hasn't budged off full)<br /><br />I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a high resolution point and shoot portable digital camera.  It's a winner.","Im more than satisfied with this camera, not only is it reasonably priced, it exceeds my expections, and here are the reasons why:<br /><br />1.  User Friendly -  very easy to use, no complicated functionalities, outstanding point and click features.  Easy to figure out because features are simple and convenient.<br /><br />2.  Photo Quality -  photo quality is very impressive for what it is.  Best Shot feature is very useful and zooming in and out is easy to do.<br /><br />3.  Battery life - this is perhaps the best feature because it is very long.  I was able to take five 10 second long video clips and 45 still pictures in one event and the battery life was still in good standing.<br /><br />4.  View screen  - is very clear, nice and wide which makes photo playback much easier and more fun.<br /><br />6.  Shutter reaction time - is about a second its easy to take  candid photos.<br /><br />7.  Camera size - small and compact, easy to carry around in a small purse or pocket.<br /><br />8  Download - very easy to download and picture quality is nice and clean.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this camera for those of you who like taking pictures of anything.","I chose this camera (after a rather intensive stint of web research) as a replacement for my bulky, sluggish Nikon Coolpix 775. I've had it for a little over a month now and I'm thrilled with it. It's fast - powers up and snaps in seconds. The pics are (to my eye) great quality; the intuitive interface and controls and \"Best Shot\" feature makes it easy to use right out of the box. The battery life is impressive as well; I used it for days snapping pics on a recent vacation without recharging it.The enormous LCD display makes it easy to review your pics before d'loading them. The convenience of the cradle is one the I'd originally underestimated, as well. All in all, a great shutterbuggin' experience.","I own a d-rebel, and I have owned an olympus 3000 before. I was looking for pocket size camera.  This camera certainly has a nice solid constructions and is very portable.  Also shoots movies which is only limited by the size of he memory.  It allows for some manual control, in ISO setting and white balance.  it also has some preset functions, where it adjusts contrast, saturation and exposure as well as flash assis for a particular shooting situation, although to set that involves going potentially 16 shooting modes.  Other than that, ther eis no manual setting of aperture or shutter speed. Battery life is good. also macro function is good.<br /><br />The big draw back is hepicture quality.  The noise level is very high.  The 5 MP rating is of limited utility, since the noise is so much, that large prints are out of question.  at times it has difficulty with focousing.  my 4 year old 3 mp olympus certainly takes better pictures.  I feel that the portability of the camera does not compensate for the poo quality of the pictures, if you are at all serious about your pictures.","I bought this camera after much research and am glad to say that I haven't regretted it for a second! I never write reviews, but since this camera has only one review so far, I thought I'd put in my $0.02 to help spread the word.<br /><br />------- WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR -------<br />Before this, I used a Nikon Coolpix 990 -- fantastic camera, but too bulky and heavy (took 4 AAs) to carry around daily. For my second camera, I wanted something very portable (i.e. small and light) with long battery life. I didn't necessarily need 5MP; that was just a bonus.<br /><br />------- PROS -------<br />Where do I begin? The EXZ50 is very small, so it's a cinch to carry around. So far, the battery life has been great. The start-up time is almost nil; no waiting for the camera to \"boot up\" once you turn it on. Even more importantly, it saves photos to the memory card very fast (my Nikon used to lag a bit) so you can take several photos in quick succession. The LCD is a good size, especially in relation to the camera. The controls are intuitive and user-friendly. Getting your photos to your PC is so easy: just put the camera in the docking station and hit the \"USB\" button! Tons of great features -- read about them on the site I mention at the end of this review [sorry, Amazon edited out the site]. Oh, and the pictures turn out great!<br /><br />------- CONS -------<br />I do have a minor quibble in that the LCD display is a bit dark in low-light conditions. Maybe that's just a given, but on the Nikon, the display was bright even in low-light. It could be that I just haven't figured out how to fix that. Also, the macro mode isn't as great as on the Nikon, but I knew that before purchasing and it was something I was willing to live with. Don't get me wrong, it isn't *bad* (the Casio manual says the range begins at 6cm), but I take a lot of close-up jewellery shots and for those, I'll continue to use my other camera. Again, the point of my getting this Casio was to have something to carry around daily.<br /><br />------- THE COMPETITION -------<br />For a long time, I'd been leaning toward getting a Canon (who seem to dominate the \"tiny camera\" field), but I read so much about the so-called \"E18 error\" that it scared me away (plus, I personally know people who've had memory card failures). I didn't go with Olympus because I read a lot about long lag-time and low battery life. Also, Olympus and Fuji use xD memory cards, which cost a bit more, and none that I looked at beat the slimness of the Casio. I already have a battery-sucking Nikon, so I skipped that brand. I've never been a big fan of Sony, so the Cybershots were out (partly b/c of those proprietary memory sticks). I almost went with a Panasonic Lumix, but it was a bit too expensive compared to others. Nothing in the Minolta family jumped out at me, either. You can see I mainly considered companies who make cameras their main business. I know Casio isn't strictly photography, but this camera does have a Pentax lens.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Overall, I'm thrilled with the Casio Exilim EX-Z50! There are tons of cameras out there, each with its pros and cons, so I know the choice is tough. Luckily, I feel I made the right one for me!","I got this camera after researching for a month what camera I thought was the best. This camera has so many features that I fell in love with. The size of it for starters is increadible. It takes such clear beautiful pictures. The docking cradle is an added bonus becuase it elimniates the hard work of downloading pictures. The camera is also light wieght and I was looking for a camera that I could fit in an evening bag. I look forward to taking this camera every with me. I definetly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a camera."]},{"name":"Casio Exilim EX-Z55","amazon_reviews":["I have 8 of these, does that tell you something?

I've now owned it for one year and have been extremely happy with the quality, features, and ease of use of this camera.<br /><br />The Z55 appealed to me for a few reasons.

Buying a digital camera is an exercise in compromise, and in the EX-Z55 Casio has found a special balance of features, a digicam sweet spot.<br /><br />There is no perfect digital camera--it's more like camera X is perfect for situation A, camera Y is perfect for situation B, and camera Z just isn't anywhere near perfect for anything.  While we all want perfect pictures, most of us would rather sacrifice some quality for a lower price, a smaller or lighter camera, longer battery life or a larger picture capacity, ease of use, fashion, or whatever.  The trick is picking the right compromise.  In my case, this includes the compromise between what I want in a camera and what my wife wants, since we just have one.  We settled on the Casio EX-Z55 eight months ago, and we aren't sorry.<br /><br />I like a lot of control over the process of taking a picture, and I don't really get all the control I want in the EX-Z55.  It's not a camera that gives you full control over aperature, shutter speed, and film speed.  Instead, it relies on its \"Best Shot\" features, pre-set combinations of such factors.  Usually this works pretty good.  On our daughter's birthday, I was able to get some nice pictures of her with her birthday cake in the dark, by candlelight alone--using the Best Shot created for this purpose.  Unfortunately, there's no Best Shot for sports--for stopping action crisply.  The best I could do was set the camera for a very fast film speed (there is limited control over such things).  But hey, I was looking for something cheap, and I don't blame the EX-Z55 for not being a professional SLR.  I have Best Shot and not full manual control--I'm dealing with it fine, and in some cases my pictures are the better for it.  One other feature I miss is the \"power winder\" setting, that lets me take a series of pictures quickly without lifting my finger from the button.  Well, I knew that feature was missing, and if it was something I really needed I would have bought something else.<br /><br />My wife and technology do not go together.  She still needs to ask for help (from me or any grade-school kid) in finding the document on the computer she just saved yesterday (usually named \"Document38\" or something).  This was actually the deciding factor in our choosing the Casio digicam over another brand I had picked out (that gave me more control).  My wife needs a camera that she can point and shoot.  Amazingly, she gets terrific pictures from this camera just pointing and shooting.  We usually leave the camera in Snapshot mode for this reason.  What really impresses me, though, is how easy the menu system is for my wife.  She occasionally wants to change the flash mode or take a short video clip instead of a picture...and so far she's been able to do what she wanted.<br /><br />Everything the manufacturer says about this camera above is true; it just works as advertised.  The shortcomings of this camera tend to be shortcomings with this TYPE of camera more than with this specific model:  It's a small camera, and sometimes when we take pictures, the movement of the camera is reflected in blurry pictures (the camera is not bigger and heavier).  It has a built-in flash, and indoor pictures that rely on flash are washed-out or grayish if not close enough (it doesn't have a standalone strobe with its own battery pack).  Crop a picture and blow it up to poster size, and quality suffers (no $500 lense, only 5 megapixels).  Video is not professional quality (no special microphone, not really a camcorder).  And so on.  But taken as a cheap point-and-shoot digicam, and it exceeds expectations--because it isn't really JUST a point-and-shoot camera.<br /><br />I've used this camera to take pictures of colleagues' business cards when I didn't have another way of makins sure I had their contact information.  I've used this camera to take pictures of documents to send via e-mail when my scanner was broken.  I've used this camera to take pictures of the ancient coins I collect to sell on eBay.  I've used this camera to take pictures by birthday candlelight.  I've used this camera to take video, and edited that video using Ulead Video Studio 8, and distributed the MPEG result.<br /><br />My bottom line:  This is not the perfect camera--but it's perfect for our family, so I give it 5 stars.  It works as advertised, and we haven't wished we would have gotten another model instead.  This feature, that feature, yada, yada--at the end of the day we have the pictures we wanted, better pictures that we've been able to get from any of our previous cameras.  I still wish I had a more professional camera--but since we're compromising on just one camera for the family, this is a better choice overall.<br /><br />A note about the Casio brand:  I like it.  I don't have any experience with their customer relations or service, as I haven't ever had any problems with any of their products until the product was so old I wanted something more up-to-date anyway--so I can't comment on the reviews of Casio service, which I see are unanimously negative here.  I've always found their quality:price ratio to my liking.","I've had my Casio Exilim EXZ55 for a year now and I'm quite happy with it.  It's small and very sleek looking.  I can take it anywhere and everywhere, and not have to worry about it taking too much space in my purse or pocket.  The pictures come out great, I love the huge LCD screen, and I've had no problems with the camera whatsoever.  It is very user friendly and it makes for a GREAT first camera for those who aren't camera/gadget savvy.  Even for someone like me who loves to take pictures and have used many cameras in the past, I am still very impressed with it!  I've used the Olympus and Minolta cameras in the past and have been happy with those, however for a small and easy to use, easy to carry around, this camera is really something!  It does the job of all the other cameras and takes less space to carry around.<br /><br />The only thing that's a bit inconvenient is the cradle you have to put it into when charging the battery or when downloading pictures...however, it's a minor detail and it's really not that big of a deal.  Speaking of battery, you only have to charge it fully once (I normally do it overnight) and the battery will last you a VERY VERY long time...I can keep it in my purse for 1-2 months taking pictures left and right before it runs out of battery (approx. 600+ pictures).  If I'm taking a lot of pictures every day, such as on a vacation, it will last me 3-4 days of taking pictures constantly, before the battery life will go low.  It's amazing how much battery life it has!<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera and for the great price, it's quite a deal!  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />PS - I normally keep the camera in a camera case when it's in my purse so it doesn't get all scratched up since I carry it EVERYWHERE.","All that the reviewers here and elsewhere have said about this camera is true. It's a good camera. I bought this as a replacement for the no-longer available Pentax Optio S.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's not as good as the Optio S. Here are the reasons:<br /><br />THE IMAGE QUALITY ISN'T AS GOOD as the 3.2 megapixel Optio S. Even when I set the Casio Exilim EXZ55 at +2 sharpness, it still isn't as sharp as the Optio S. It's interesting, too, that Pentax makes the lens for this camera, and is the same lens (5.8-17.4mm Pentax SMC) as the one in the Optio S...by name only?<br /><br />THE SETTINGS IN THE EXZ55 WON'T TAKE: The contrast, saturation, sharpness, and flash on/off can be set, but when you turn the power off and then back on again, the above settings are forgotten....everything's back to zero, and the flash is back on. When it won't keep these settings I mentioned, it to me is THE major flaw in the design. The settings are remembered if you go to the MY BEST SHOT mode.<br /><br />The EXZ55 is a handsome camera; about equal in the good looks department to the Optio S. It's a little bit bigger than the classic Optio S, so it won't fit inside an Altoids tin like the Optio S. Oh well.<br /><br />Now for the positive attributes of the EXZ55 that the other reviewers perhaps overlooked: The handling is very good. It's not too small that it might be awkward for bigger hands. I have small hands, and this 3.4\" x 2.3\" camera is just the right size. The controls are layed out much better than the Optio S, and one doesn't need magnifying glasses. The battery/SD card door is metal-hinged, and has a spring tensioner. Much better than the Optio S' plastic hinge! Oh, and the colors from this camera are absolutely stunning.<br /><br />Finally, with a 1 gigabyte SD card + internal memory, the shot capacity is 434. Very nice. This camera isn't perfect. The lack of memory for the settings I mentioned, and the so-so image quality is keeping it from becoming a classic like the Optio S. All its other great features that everyone's been raving about is what makes it in my recommendation column.","The Casio Exilim EXZ55 competes head to head with the Canon SD400 and SD450.<br /><br />Likes: The Casio zoom control is in a more convenient place than the Canon. It is right where my thumb wants it to be. The Canon zoom is on a ring around the shutter button and I feel like I'm going to drop the camera when I zoom out. The Casio battery life is almost three times as long as the Canon. So long that you should not worry if you forgot your spare battery. The Casio battery can be charged inside the camera using the docking station (the Canon battery must be removed from the camera to charge). The docking station is also a little more convenient than Canon's loose cable if you want to use USB to upload pictures.<br /><br />Dislikes: I think the Canon does a little better job in low light situations with no flash. The Casio images look a little \"blocky\" on close inspection. However, with flash, the Casio does a better job. The Casio has very even lighting (I think it has digital compensation to reduce dark corners.","The camera is small, but not too small and the huge screen is great to view photos immediately with friends etc. I really like this camera..perfect except that I have a mac and can't play the video back..they need to change this...if they do, it would be a 5 star camera..love it!","I haven't used a lot of digital camera but this one is, by far, the best I've used. The Casio Exilim has 5.0 megapixels of power mated to a 3X optical zoom that appears far more enhanced than that. It has a large viewfinder that gives an excellent idea of your subject, framed for easy reference.<br /><br />I don't generally like these little bitty new cameras but this one blew me away when I used it. The ease of operation and ease of transferring outstanding 5.0 images to PC or other media sold me on this.<br /><br />If you can buy this camera for less than $400 you will be very happy with it for a long time.","I bought this camera for a trip to Brazil with my daughter.. I bought a 1gb card for it.  We had  the ability to take 500 photos.  We actually did take almost 400 and I never had to re-charge the battery--not once.  My daughter used three sets of batteries for her own camera and only took 98 photos.  I used it under all lighting conditions and the photos are beautiful.  Everyone is commenting on how beautiful the photos are-clear and the good color.  It is so small and light that I took it everywhere with me and this is something new for me.  I never enjoyed carting a camera around before. This is my first digital and it was easy to learn how to use it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera.","My daughter really love this camera I got for her. Compared to other digital cameras we have purchased from the past, I think I made the right choice in purchasing this awesome camera. No regret.","I have researched cameras for a while now, with my own personal experiences in all of the large brands...kodak, sony, canon, nikon... and i have to say all of them are inferior to this camera. the z55 is awesome.  below i have listed pros and cons for casio, most of which are great<br /><br />pros<br /><br />1)everything the camera states is true, battery life is phenominal, ive taken 450+ pictures and then it dies, it would definately last a weeks trip to the mountains<br /><br />2)very sturdy its strong and can eaisly be slipped into a purse.there is no need to worry about breaking it because it has a hard coat lcd screen, meaning theres a little peice of plastic on the screen, protecting it from scratches and harm.definate plus for me<br /><br />3) very handsom and very shique, its a subtle silver (looks like the silver ipod except little lighter) with little peices of polished metal surrounding the edges and lens.. very sophisticated<br /><br />4) ergonomics were good... i usually take pictures with one hand, i never felt like it would drop, it has a little grip on the front and the back is recessed to fit your hand comfortably. however i highly suggest using the wrist strap just in case it does fall<br /><br />5) THIN, wow its pretty small, its about the size of a credit card and is about 8/10 of an inch thick, overall its tiny<br /><br />6) outdoor picture quality is awesome, bright, clear, and macro (close up pictures) are the best ive seen in any compact camera, i can take pictures of a fly and see the hair on it :) wow!<br /><br />7)lcd is very big, however it is low resolution, but in my oppinion who cares? i dont have to squint and i laugh at all the 1.5 lcds :)<br /><br />8)menu system i think its the best in the market, lets you control ALMOST everything- saturation, contrast, flash, and 23 preset picture modes, thats crazy (sunset, flowers, food, parties)!!!<br /><br />9)its fast! it focuses fairly fast one second and takes another second to write to the card<br /><br />cons :(<br /><br />1)indoor picture is grainy, i have to set it at 50 iso to get decent quality, still nice but your going to need a lot of light around<br /><br />2)for best results indoor it requires flash, this is a definite con for me since i like to work with natural light<br /><br />3)white balance has got issues, you have to adjust it when your inside, or else you get a yellow tint, very minor but kind of annoying<br /><br />overall i think this is the best camera on the market, its small, cool, great featres, beautiful picture quality, awesome macro mode, built to last and its battery lasts a good 1-3 weeks, at least (with the lcd and flash on too)... most of the issues are for indoor only(although still very nice), so if you take most pictures outside, this is perfect.  in my oppinion i was doubtful when i first bought it, wanted a sony or canon for brand but i highly doubt they could contend with the z55, this is an overall good product, although it might not be for everyone, try it out before you buy it. dont think that this reveiw isnt trust worthy just cause im a kid, i know more about cameras than most adults:) seriously...  hope this helps :)","I've had the camera for about 6 months now.  Overall I'm thrilled with it.  I like pretty much the same stuff as everyone else - nice big screen, loaded with features, intuitive operation, long battery life, small - all terrific.<br /><br />I agree with those that complain about some picture quality although I've had quality problems on other expensive digital cameras too so ...  The quality problems I have on this one relate to curvature in the corners in some pictures and can be kind of dark for low-light conditions (night time indoors).  Most of the pictures turn out great though.  Lots of detail and look fantastic when printed.  The occasional pic problems are minor nuisances in the overall scheme.  It's a terrific camera and I happily recommend it to anyone.","I came accross this product online and i read reviews from different customers and i was impressed. I decided to give it a try. Among other rivals are sony DSC-T7 at $499.95, nikon and some other like that. Sony DSCT7 was the bottom of the least rated even though it's slim and cute. I have a bad experience with sony handycam dcr-dvd 301. It shoots movies nice, but can't take good pictures. that's when i started shopping for digital cameral. My experiece so far is unimaginable. No regret at all. The pix are excellent, the movie is good and the battery continues to go and go. The foto loader is da bomb men! i will forever recommend this product.","I am not one of these reviewers that is just impressed by the camera look and size...I have had many digital cameras in the past (have used Nikon, Sony, Canon, etc.) and am very experienced with technology products and I only buy the best (hence I do TONS of research, I even contact the companies techincal departments to ask questions...)<br /><br />Please take this review very seriously when I say the Casio EX Z 55 is the best small size high resolution camera currently on the market, from features to LCD screen to picture quality, to price/value level, to build quality--frankly, it blew me away right out of the box:<br /><br />1.  Size and build:  Although not as slim as its little brother, it is quite small (.88 mm deep), yet VERY solid.  It is all metal and metal alloy and most importantly, the LCD is protected by a plexi-protector (thank you for not making the same dumb mistake as Canon and sony). Although the battery cover is plastic (like all other digital cameras), unlike others, this one has a sliding lock that is spring loaded with a metal piece and even has a locking battery piece inside--so no worries about anything breaking off or falling out!  The camera, although tiny, is easy to hold and control with your hands automatically knowing where to go naturally--very well thought out layout. Button are minimal and VERY well marked.  A 10-year old could master the device in less than 20 minutes, and that says alot about ease of use because the camera has TONS of features!!!<br /><br />LCD Screen:  Yes, the pixel count is lower than Sony, Canon or Nikon models...do NOT let that scare you away. The image quality of the LCD, the anti-glare properties and the LCD processor are far superior!  You can hold at almost any angle in any light and clearly read the display. Canon models \"white out\".  The LCD does not jitter or delay (like all other digital cameras), the image looks 100% real time--great processor!  People mention a  bit of grainy-ness...not really, what they are seeing is the decreased resolution and darkening when you use the zoom.  the scrren gains up in low light and you can also further adjust it. i am truly impressed w/ the screen and i did not even mention its huge 2.5\" size!!!<br /><br />pic clarity:  dont take my word for it...read the professional reviews (steve's digicams, PC world, PC magazine, DP Preview, etc) Pic quality is far superior to the canon SD series and sony.  these images blew away my 4 MP Nikon w/ Nikoor lens.  5 megapixel means crisp, clear shots. color is spot on and the \"Best shot\" scene options are handy and work well! The zoom is an improved Pentax lens, works great up to 3x optical, will stick in their with any Nikkor or Sony lens. When you think Casio, you may not think of cameras...but Casio uses its processor and battery technology and partners with camera companies to produce a device that is best of both worlds!<br /><br />by the way, camera battery life really is really as long as you've heard...i could not drain it over 3 days of continous use with LCD on.","I love this camera and it takes terrific pictures. Have an intermitent problem with lens jamming when extended.  Camera 2 months old, problem from beginning.  My problem is with Casio. They will only replace the new 2 month old camera with a reconditioned product.  I find this unacceptable and would never buy another Casio product because of their customer service and warranty.  When you pay a lot of money for a new camera you expect it replaced with a new camera, not a reconditioned camera I never would have bought to begin with.  Fortunately for me I was able to have the camera replaced at point of purchase.  It is a terrific, easy to use camera with excellent photos, my only complaint is with Casio's cusomter service/warranty, and it will keep me from buying another Casio product.","This was a xmas gift and I've used it ever since. It is the best! Takes excellent photo's both indoors and out. Blows photo's up nicely and clear. Perfect size. All around - the best I've used. I did buy a new memory card because the memory wasn't large enough but that is it. It was a disappointment they don't print the manual though - but it is available online.","Well, I can not hide the good features in the Z55<br /><br />- Big LCD<br /><br />- Fast playback<br /><br />- Fast start up<br /><br />- MMC/SD (You will enjoy this feature if you have a card reader instead of using the USB base)<br /><br />But I found two bad things in this camera:<br /><br />1. Indoor images are bad (opposite of the great images taken outdoor) I mean if you depend on a bulb light you will get bad images, otherwise it is perfect under the sun.<br /><br />2. Once I make a zoom (after transfering the images to my laptop not in the camera) for the images I dont get the same quality (bad sharpness) - opposite of the SONY T1 models .. everytime you enlarge you get higher quality<br /><br />Finally, I recommend SONY.","I spent countless hours online searching for the BEST in the ultra-compacts, went to all the non-biased www sites searching out WHICH ultra-compact digital was the best unit, they ALL pointed to the EX-Z55 CASIO. I bought mine a few days ago, its MORE than even i expected, an im pretty darn cynical!<br /><br />the BEST feature (since i own 2 other digital cameras) on this unit is that it has an instant shot feature which bypasses the half-shutter-then focus-then full shutter and shot,.........you can depress the shutter release full ways without doing a prefocus, which is VERY IMPORTANT for catching those candid shots that WILL NOT WAIT for a time-consuming focus then shot.<br /><br />built rugged, menu is a breeze, the docking station is wonderful, and  GOODNESS! the battery life is beyond beyond!. The hype about this units ultra long battery life is NO HYPE, even with flash on every shot, i still havent been able to kill the battery on this baby yet!.<br /><br />Good job casio, you really skunked Sony, Olympus and Canon and Nikon in the ultra compact dept.<br /><br />the only downside to this camera is that its sharpness is less than perfect, but easily adjusted in computer on photo suite software, but heck it IS an ultra-compact, so its lens is tiny.<br /><br />I agree with PC Magazines digi-cam review about this model which said \"this is THE BEST PICTURE weve ever seen from an ultra-compact\",  i agree.<br /><br />the Casio EX-Z55 outclasses all comperable models of sony, olympus and canon after extensive research.","This camera is absolutely wonderful.  I tried the Z40 and the it was very similar, took great AVI and features were the same, however the quality of the actual digital photo seemed a bit-sub par in my opinion.  THis Z55 has a much better picture and really delivers.  It takes great AVI footage and clear crisp pictures for such a tiny little camera.  It also comes with a cool dock that plugs right into my iMac(or any usb port).<br /><br />I like the 2\" LCD ad the long battery life along with the ZOOM and 5 megapixels.<br /><br />We take pictures and movies all the time now.  Invest in a nice photo printer and say goodbye to the photolab!<br /><br />[...]","My husband and I have been wanting a digital camera for some time now.  We would love a digital SLR, but can't afford it right now.  This one is nice because it is so compact and can be taken anywhere without having to lug a big camera bag around.  We love the big screen and the buttons that make it very easy to switch between camera mode and playback mode.<br /><br />We haven't had this camera for very long (a couple of weeks only), so we haven't had any printed out on photo paper, but on the computer the pictures look very good and sharp, especially with a little help from photo editing software.  We really like the different macro functions.<br /><br />The battery life is great!  We took about 250 pictures our first time out with it, all with the screen on and some with the flash on, and the battery meter didn't go down at all.<br /><br />So far it seems like this camera will be great for us and so far, I would highly recommend it as a great take everywhere digital camera!","What a nice camara!!! I think this is my most satisfied digital product! Honestly, I used to be a SONY bigot because of my SONY laptop and SONY P9 camara. However, today, the amazing Z55 changes everything. It was hard to make a choice between Z55 and Sony T1, but it will be much easier to choose when you have this little boy in your hand.<br /><br />I can not believe that Casio could ever be able to produce a stuff like this. I don't need any system installation to support USB link. I just plug the usb to my computer, then it's done.<br /><br />Except the size and weight, I was impressed by its 2560*1920 output picture. People who own this bad boy should know what I'm talking about, right? Everybody who take this bad boy home will be shocked like me.","My husband bought this camera about 3 months ago and we continue to love it...wow, what an improvement over our old Canon Digital Elph. The Casio is SO easy to use: I've never even looked at the manual. Admittedly, I still have a soft spot for my (aging) Oly C-2100UZ but of course it is not pocketable like this Casio. This little workhorse gets taken anywhere and everywhere and gets a lot of use!<br /><br />The Casio has a HUGE LCD and it feels very sturdy. It's incredibly responsive and just feels good! I'm happy with the picture quality (quite good for a subcompact) and I didn't realize how much I would like the cradle for recharging the camera. We bought an extra battery, and haven't even needed to use it yet!","This is just one great little camera.  We were going on a cruise vacation to Mexico and both I and the wife needed new cameras.  For myself I got the latest and greatest from Nikon the 8800 and she got the Casio which she just loves.  The interesting thing was that on vacation no one came rushing over to look at and wow my new Nikon but they sure did with her.  It seemed like very time she took a picture someone would come over and ask about it. It is simple to use, ultra small and takes wonderful photos.","The Casio EX-Z55 is especially notable for two salient features not found in other ultra-compact, ultra-thin digital cameras:<br /><br />1) A *huge* 2.5\" LCD screen (vs. 2\" on the slightly cheaper Z50).  You probably have seen labels on other tiny cameras that claim \"large 1.8-in LCD.\"  Well, this tiny Z55 has a whopping 2.5\" (diagonal) screen which is almost twice as big as the 1.8\" ones.<br /><br />2) Incredible battery life for such a small camera.  Casio rates this at 400 pictures using some industry standard measurement (called \"CIPA\").  In comparison, the Canon SD300 is rated at 140, the Pentax Optio S5i at 160, and the Panasonic DMC-FX7 (with vibration reduction) at 120.  I have not measured real-world battery life since I didn't have the camera for long, but I took over 200 pictures (about 1/4 with flash and all with the LCD on) and there was still plenty of juice left.<br /><br />Unlike many ultra-compacts, this camera does have an optical viewfinder, albeit a tiny one.  If you want to prevent blurry pictures, you may want to use the optical viewfinder more, as holding the camera close to your face helps steady your shots.<br /><br />Now, what about the Picture Quality?<br /><br />First, as I always tell people: be realistic in your expectations.  This is a very small camera, which means it has a very small lens (and aperture) and a very small sensor inside.  The law of physics simply cannot be defied.  The guy who owns a Canon EOS Digital Rebel of course complains about the picture quality of this Casio; it's like you own a Ferrari Enzo and then tries to expect the same performance from a Toyota Corolla.  No matter how refined the Corolla is, it simply does not have the same power or performance as the Enzo, simply because it's in a different class, intended for a different audience, and has a much smaller engine.<br /><br />Digital SLRs such as the Nikon D70 and Canon EOS Digital Rebel are large and expensive for a reason: they are designed to wrestle the best performance out of digital sensors (CCD or CMOS).  The Casio EX-Z55, like other ultra-compacts, is designed to be pocketable (even in a shirt).  Cameras like this simply cannot take ultra-sharp pictures; their tiny lenses simply won't allow that.<br /><br />OK, enough philosophizing.  The Casio is best for casual shots.  You know, the shots at a party or club, the candid shots of kids and pets, the family shots at the local park or zoo.  This is a take-anywhere-shoot-anywhere camera.  It's even pretty fast in starting up so you can just take it out, turn it on, and shoot.  It's best used as a point-and-shoot (also known as an idiot's camera).<br /><br />If you compare the Casio's picture quality vis-a-vis that of the Pentax Optio S5i or Canon SD300, you'll see it holds up pretty well.  In fact, I would say for this tiny amazing thing, the picture quality is pretty high.  The picture is a little on the soft side, but that can be sharpened in most image editing packages.  If your intention is to make prints, the picture quality is sufficient, esp. after you apply a little bit of sharpening.  Let me put this way: for most casual shots (which is what we consumer photographers do anyway), the Z55's picture quality does not disappoint.<br /><br />But don't take my word for it.  Hop over to Best Buy or Circuit City or Radio Shack and take a look at this amazing camera yourself.  If you want a pocketable camera with good picture quality and amazing battery life and a large, impressive LCD, the EX-Z55 should be your top choice.","This is the first camera I've bought that's both digital and non-SLR, and it will most likely be my last.<br /><br />Casio was probably the last name I would've thought of when looking for a digital camera. Casio's name was synonymous in my head with electric musical instruments and low cost home appliances (phones, clocks, etc).<br /><br />I was looking at Sonys and Canons primarily, and my main point of reference was reading the customer reviews. Those cameras got generally good reviews, but every so often there'd be one written by someone that actually knew what they were talking about and I had to cross them off my list. Then this Casio popped up. Wow.<br /><br />This camera not only has all the features you could need, but it actually takes GREAT pictures.<br /><br />And to speak of the battery life, it's unprecedented. Today is January 14th. I received and started using my camera on December 19th. I've taken well over 100 pictures, all using the LCD and flash. I have yet to recharge the battery, and the meter still shows full!<br /><br />This is really a phenomenal camera and makes the other so-called \"high end\" (4MP+) Sony and Canon cameras pale in comparison. Smaller screens, lower resolutions, less battery life, worse picture quality, and with a higher price. It just doesn't make sense to buy anything else in this price range!","I bought this camera based on the reviews on Amazon, and overall I am quite pleased with it.  I bought it to replace my Olympus C3040 zoom, which took beautiful pictures until it died.  This camera is so much smaller, lightweight, and so much easier to use than my Olympus was.  The battery power is amazing.  It seems like it never needs charging.  My Olympus took four AA rechargeables, and I had to charge it every time I used it.  This one, in contrast, plugs into its own little charging dock, and I really believe them when they say it will take 400 pictures on one charge.  I have never run out of power yet.  My only complaint is that the flash is a little weak, which makes my indoor photos less than perfect.  But that truly is my ONLY complaint.  My outdoor photos are beautiful.  I was able to use it right out of the box, without even reading the manual, because the menus are so easy to navigate and use.  It's just a great little camera.","I just want to educate you on a topic you may not think about.<br /><br />This topic is the fact that some people write reviews that are from the company to make you buy it.  Take the one written on this product, the one that is first, and decide for yourself.<br /><br />I am not denying Casio's product, I am merely informing you on this issue.<br /><br />I would have to say overall the camera was good, some features I would take off.<br /><br />Casio is a reliable brand, though, because my camera fell in the water and it still works perfectly (was it luck or the camera?)<br /><br />Thank you for reading my informative review.","i think that this is the best cammera on the market!!!!!!!!!!","THis is the best digital camera i have ever seen the picture is so clear and the screen is the largerst i have seen.  I love this camera and i hope that you will too @~!~~~~","On paper the EXZ55 looks great. But once I got it there were a few things i did not like. I had this camera for a couple of weeks and returned it. I'm going to try the canon sd300.<br /><br />I liked<br /><br />- great battery life<br /><br />- big screen<br /><br />- solid construction<br /><br />- movie recording with sound and audio playback is great<br /><br />- very compact with a lot of features<br /><br />I returned it because<br /><br />- It's a two-handed camera. You have to hold it with your left and operate with your right. I want a cam that can be held and operated with one hand. My old cam ( a canon s100 from way back in 2000) could be held in the right hand while operating the zoom and clicking the pic with the right index finger. But with the Z55's button placement, I was sure that sooner or later I would drop it if I tried use it with one hand.<br /><br />- Movie / Picture mode can only be selected by menu. Multiple clicks and navigation are required to switch between the two, so you might miss a shot, or you might forget to switch and start recording in the wrong mode. I'd rather have a switch on the outside so I can quickly toggle movie / picture.<br /><br />- Not the best photos. I had some great shots and some weak ones. I think it's a focus problem rather than a lens or CCD problem. Sometimes the cam figured out what to focus on, giving great pictures. Other times things looked fuzzy and grainy. There was a lot of variability in sequential shots of the same scene and lighting, so I don't think it was user error.<br /><br />Other things I didnt like that I could have lived with:<br /><br />- I didn't like the cradle (althought I've read that some people do). I prefer the chargers where you take the battery out.<br /><br />- Casio makes two cases that supposedly are tailored for the Z55. But I found that one was way too big, and one was too small. Actually my old Canon S100 leather case fit pretty well.<br /><br />- The LCD is not recessed, so I expect the screen surface will get scratched up unless you're very careful.","I bought this camera after owning the EX-S3 (3.2) Casio card camera for a year. I took the other camera with me on a military deployment and it stood up to sand, heat, humidity and then freezing cold, so I already knew that this line of cameras is very hardy. This camera exceeds all expectations. It has a large screen, takes movies with sound, snapshots to which you can add a voice tag if you wish, and has a variety of snapshot modes for black and white, extreme closeups, portraits, sepia tones and split images where you take one half of the photo and then the second half with another subject in it. It takes excellent pictures at night. There is very little distortion for low light pictures or movies. Learning the indicators and modes is easy and intuitive. This camera is not as small as the 3.2 or 4.0 megapixel cameras - it is thicker, but still able to sit in a shirt pocket (not a pants pocket). The battery life exceeds the EX-S3 model by at least 300 photos. Cons: 1)No camera case. 2) Extra batteries cost a lot. I advise not buying an \"off-market\" battery, because they don't quite fit in this camera. I have bought two and they were too short to make a decent contact. So stick to the Casio battery. 3) Manual is on a CD - you have to print it out yourself or look at it on a computer screen.<br /><br />My best success with this camera was using the extreme closeup mode (called \"macro mode\") to take pictures of old snapshots in a family album. I didn't use a tripod, I held the camera in my hands and the pictures were phenomenal. I was able to focus in on one person in a group shot and my photo looked as though that was the original - of just that person. This is an esoteric use, but I was pleasantly surprised. I agree with one reviewer here who says to get a 1GB memory card - definitely needed or you may run out of memory space after taking movies and snapshots for hours. One last thing: you can change the size of the photos you take, from email size to a size that you can make a poster out of. You can also take a picture then later crop the photo to focus on one item more closely, while you are looking at the photo on the camera's screen. There are several features that this camera has, but you don't find out unless you get into the manual a bit. I recommend this highly.<br />Additional note 25 Feb 2017: Obviously I have had this camera for a long time and it just quit. By that I mean I charged up the battery, placed it in the camera and got a green light indicating the battery was OK, pressed the \"on\" button and -- nothing.The only indication that something was wrong was the failure of the flash to initiate in low light situations. I hadn't had any trouble with low light photos with this camera until that started happening. So now it won't start up at all and I may get another one used or chalk it up to an old camera simply giving up the ghost and move on. Overall this was a great camera and it lasted for 13 years.","This camera is so great I gave my Sony 5.0 digital to my nephew. The battery life is unbelieveably long. It is by far the most user friendly camera on the market. The large LCD screen is so easy to see and manipulate. My Sony battery life was 45 minutes. With this camera it just keeps on and on.... I will stay with this camera for years to come.","Note to AMAZON REP. REVIEWING THIS EDIT:  I HAVE MADE SOME MINOR CHANGES (SPELLING, CLARITY, ETC. OF MY ORIGINAL REVIEW) AND ADDED AN UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM.  PLEASE PUT THIS ONE IT'S ITS PLACE AS IT HAS ALL NECCESSARY CHANGES AND UPDATES.  I HAVE SENT THIS BEFORE WITH NO LUCK...HOPEFULLY THIS MESSAGE HELPS.  THANKS!!<br /><br />MY REVIEW:  This camera is absolutely wonderful!  In searching for a new digital camera, I was looking for several things...small size, excellent picture quality, and fast reaction time.  Not many things...just big improvements over my last camera (a Nikon Coolpix).  The Exilim Z55 has these features and MANY MORE! I do my research - and this camera came out on top!<br /><br />Below is my review(...)<br /><br />  I cannot believe how much thoughT Casio put into the features and orgnaization of this camera.  You can access each feature quickly and easily.  In a short time I was already able to use almost all the features of this camera (I never figured out half them on my other camera, or they would take so long to change that I didn't bother).  I didn't really care about the large LCD display when buying the camera...but now it's one of my favorite features.  Because of this display, I can switch between the different scene modes easily.  At the press of the button I can access the 23 different scene modes and decide which one to use. because of the big LCD display, there is room for Csaio to give the user a short description of what each scene mode does right on the camera...so I understand when to use it and what it is doing.  Also, when alter modes such as white balance, you can see on the LCD displayhow the change will affect the picture.  This is because the icon help menu pops up on top of whatever you are viewing (no blue screen). And, of course, the large LCD display makes it very easy to see pictures, aand delete the ones that you don't want (another easy thing to do at the puch of a button.  These two things (ease of use and LCD display) did not go into my decision to buy this camera but have been surprisengly wonderful and helped me really anjoy and get the most out of my camera.<br /><br />  Picture quality - wonderful. On the Exilim z-40, people complained about low light picture quality.  Not on the z-50.  Casio has done several things to correct it...this camera has flash assist (see casio website for more info on this), as well as gives the user the ability to quickly change the flash intensity.  I'm telling you, if you use the features of this camera (which is not hard to do at all)...your pictures will come out great!  Color saturation is beautiful and the pictures are very crisp and clear.  At the stores, I took pictures with this and 3 different cameras (a Nikon, Kodak, HP)...the Casio's pictures were great (looked like 35 mm camera pictures), clear, crisp, colorful... and not as dark as some of the others.  And this was before I knew how to use any of the cameras features.<br /><br />  Fast reaction time...no more missing that first smile, the half second you child actually looks at the camera, or the one second someone takes to blow out the last candle on the cake.  Casio's ex-z55 turns on in 1.5 seconds and takes the picture within .01 seconds after pressing the button.  I LOVE IT!!!!<br /><br />  Battery life!  They just keep going and going and going.  You can take like 400 pictures with this camra on one battery!  I don't worry about taking time to view pictures, play around with modes, etc because I know I still have plenty of battery life let.  This first day I got this camera, I played around with it contantly fr hours and at the end of the day, still had a full bar.  Plus, Casio gives you a rechargeable battery which you can recharge right in the camera by putting the camera into the cradle/docking station (another nice feature; also provided) each night.  Now that I mentioned it...the docking station.  Need to download picutres...no more messing with wires and connecting them to the back of the computer.  Just place the camera into the docking station (which is plugged into your computer at all times (if you choose and I would), and download them.  Not to mention, your battery won't go dead downloaded pictures, as the docking station will power it while you download.  See what I mean...CASIO THOUGHT OF IT ALL.<br /><br />  Along with several other cameras, after much research I narrowed it down to this camera and the Canon S500, but after reading many reviews about the dreaded E18 error which eventually leaves the camera unusable, I leaned more to this one and I am so glad!  The Exilim has a steel case so is not subject to change of pressures, and tempurture problems as some other aluminum bodies camera.  Seriously, if you are looking for a pocket size camera with many features and great piture quality.  Take a look at this camera...you will be impressively surprised.  I appreciate a company who takes the time to really think about their product, how to make it easy to use, and really makes improvements over their last model.  I don't give out 5 stars to everything, normally I don't even leave reviews on things I have purchased, but I am so impressed with this camera and really think people need to come and check it out.<br /><br />  If you want to see this model in person, most Circuit City's have one on display.  Go take a look...you won't be disappointed.<br />I'll be sure to update this review if I do find out anything unfortunate...but I don't think I will need to.  Hope this information helps...Good luck with you're new camera and ENJOY!","I saw this new camera and fell in love with the large screen. I mean how many times can you look at a 1 inch screen and figure out if you want to keep the pic? The large screen is the best I've seen. It's a bit pricey but worth the money. It's thin enough to keep in my pocket. Only problem is that they don't sell anything to protect your camera if it's bouncing around in your pocket. Get a 1 Gig  card and you can keep on shooting. It makes  a very nice picture, even on the fly. The playback of the flies are FAST, FAST, FAST!!!"]},{"name":"Casio Exilim EX-S100","amazon_reviews":["Great Camera, Takes crisp pictures, excellent zoom as well.

I'm not sure how it compares to other cameras in it's new price range.","This is my 2nd Pentax digital camera, and I have owned it for 2 years.  I've always liked the what they have been doing with the sizing of the cameras, keeping the very small.  This one is, very small, so it's great for any situation because you can carry it around like a cell phone.  Picture quality for the most part, is very good.<br /><br />The problem I have with this camera is the inconsistant performance. Day time shots are great, but low light or evening shots are not the best.  There are different modes you can use, but I have found the night shot mode to be worthless.  You have to hold the camera still for several seconds, but my shots have always blurred severely.  The other problem I have expirienced is with the shutter release.  On most digital cameras, you press the shutter release about 1/2 way and the camera lets you know when it's ready to take the picture (light changing, focus box on lcd, etc.).  About 1/3 of the time, this pentax will not take the picture once you think it's ready.  It requires about 5-6 additional presses on the shutter release to take the picture.  Very annoying when you have someone waiting for you to take their picture and the camera won't work.  One other thing is that with all the ultra compacts out now with 2.5\" to 3.0\" LCDs, this 1.8\" is starting to feel quite small.<br /><br />I have had good luck with Pentax before and I won't let these few annoyances deter me from puchasing another pentax.  If you are looking for a small, compact, digital camera, I would suggest other pentax models such as the T10 or T20 which are in the same price range, but newer.","We really like this camera!  It's a WHOLE lot better than our previous one, which ran off 4 AA batteries, and ran THROUGH so many AA batteries so quickly that we can't even guess how many $$ that wasted.  This Optio camera uses very nice rechargable batteries that cost $5 each through Ebay (don't buy them here on Amazon... ouch!)  We've got 3 batteries and are getting two more so that we never even have to worry about power while on a long trip.  (The really handy travel charger is also awesome... get it on Ebay for just a few bucks.)<br /><br />The startup time and shutter speed are very fast, so catching quick pictures is finally possible for us.  (My wife no longer threatens to go back to film after using this camera!)  Our last camera would take so long to focus that we never got the candid shots we wanted.<br /><br />The one and only thing that's even a slight problem with this camera is the power button being next to the shutter button.  (What clueless engineer thought THAT would be good??)  However, now that we've used it a lot, we never hit the button by accident.<br /><br />All other features of the camera are great.  With a 1 GB memory card, we've never ever run out of memory space, even with taking lots of short videos and many many pictures on medium quality.<br /><br />Great camera, worth every cent.  Buy the accessories on Ebay and you'll find that getting everything you need is not very expensive at all.  (Actually, we bought the camera on Ebay too, but these reviews are great here on Amazon.  Thanks, Amazon!)","this is a great camera for traveling, it is small enough to fit into your top pocket, so it can go anywhere. the only problem that i have is that there is no underwater housing for it, if there was i would have given it a 5*.","I have been through 6 cameras in the past 3 years, of all different kinds of brands and price. I have changed so many times because they get stolen or broken...this little pentax optio was surprising though! 3 months after having it around, i brought it to the desert and it got some sand in it, but I had it fixed. THis same camera also fell three floors down and nothing was damaged; neither the screen, the lens, nor the flash. it just got cracked a bit and twisted, and the battery/memory card  cover is completely damaged, but it still works like it should!","I have had this camera a year now and am VERY impressed.  I have used Nikon 35mm SLR's all my life so I was a little hesitant going into digital.  Lugging around equipment became too much of a issue so I started looking.  Picture quality is great even at full optical zoom.  I very rarely use the digital zoom.  Most impressive...the camera has taken 2 direct hits on the concrete and (8 months ago) and still works perfectly!","I hear a lot of grumbling about the camera not being \"perfect.\"  But guess what ... in this size and form factor one should not be expecting SLR-like performance.  I just purchased this camera last week and have been busy testing it out in a variety of situations.  The \"Full Auto\" mode does a pretty decent job of figuring out the right settings for most situations.  If you want you can take total control and set most controls manually.  There are even a bunch of pre-programmed setting for different lighting situations and the couple that I tested worked great.  All in all, great camera for the size.  I like the fact that I can put this in my shirt pocket and forget about it and then when I suddenly need to take a picture I always have the camera handy.  I have a normal speed SD Memory card and writing out the images to the card can be painfully slow.  This is especially true when trying to take a number of quick shots in rapid succession.  The wait for the camera to become ready to take the next shot is annoying.

Good luck!","I bought this camera about a month ago but returned it due to lackluster performances. It is not a horrible camera but for the price, I can get a better camera without having to settle for less. I used the camera to snap photographs of my students only to find that the pictures were horribly dark even with the flash. Of the 15 pictures I took, only 2 came out with decent hues; all the other photos were excessively dark to the point that even the students noticed the odd coloring. The camera is known for taking slightly underexposed pictures. I tried to compensate for this by changing the darkness of my photos but this didn't do the trick either. Upon my next major use of the camera, I noticed my pictures were once again horribly dark but this time from the lack of flash capability. The problem of having a small LCD screen such as the one for this camera is that photos appearing clear on the LCD come out blurry when printed. After careful consideration, I returned the camera and am looking into either the Nikon 5900 or the Canon SD400. *fingers crossed*","I bought this camera a couple months ago because I wanted a small digital camera that would be easy to carry with me. Since then, I've found the S5i to be a wonderful camera that takes clear colorful pictures and can easily fit in your pocket.<br /><br />Here are some praises for the S5i:<br /><br />1. This camera is TINY. It is smaller than my cellphone. This makes it extremely easy to bring with when going on a trip or just out for the day. I have it in my pocket at all times, ready to capture any moment. I brought it with on a recent trip and everybody thought it was great. At the end of the day we hooked it up to the TV in the hotel and watched a slide show of the day. Everyone loved it.<br /><br />2. The battery life in incredible. I have had this thing for a couple months and I have only charged it like 4 times. Even with extended use of the flash and screen, the battery still keeps kicking. Very different from my cellphone!<br /><br />3. The super macro focus setting creates beautiful photos. This was something I didn't realize the camera had until after I bought it. You can get right up to things and take these really colorful and crisp images. Flowers and plants look incredible.<br /><br />4. The red-eye reduction is the best I've ever seen. With the red-eye flash mode, the camera flashes once and then about a second later flashes again and takes the picture. None of my pictures suffer from red-eye anymore. The flash is also very powerful.<br /><br />5. It has many manual settings for more artistic pictures. I still haven't even gotten to check out all the little features this camera comes with. It has a lot of different \"scene\" presets and also allows you to do manual mode (with focus & exposure).<br /><br />Overall, this camera met and exceeded all the expectations I had. I would definitely recommend the Pentax S5i to a family member or friend.","I just got this camera a month ago and I am satisfied with it. It has a lot of features despite its size. And for point and shoot I can say it's a great buy, comparable to other power packed cameras, it even takes better pictures sometimes.<br /><br />But I just had to give it a 4 because I thought I could do more with it. But you can't do much with the settings since it has it's own default settings for certain conditions. But over all it's a great camera. If you're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek, this is definitely a good buy.","I've had this camera since just before Christmas 04.  I purchased from [...] for about $350.  I should have waited until after the holidays, because the price has come down.  It is great to finally have a small camera.  I often forget that I even have it with me (which I guess can be bad!).  Over all the pictures are good.  The focus is sometimes soft.  It doesn't take good night photos, but takes great daytime pics.","I have owned quite a few digital cameras, all of which seemed to have followed the rules of 'technical tradeoffs':<br /><br />If you want quality, you pay more and you lose form factor.<br /><br />If you want form factor, you pay more and you lose quality<br /><br />If you pay less, you lose on both quality and formfactor.<br /><br />And so on and so on.<br /><br />Knowing this, I bought this camera for its form factor and hence did not expect the highest quality pictures. Nonetheless, it has impressed me. I've barely touched the settings since I put the camera on auto focus and auto flash (well, except adjusting white balance).<br /><br />In fact, this is my second optio. I purchased the 4MP for myself about a year ago, and purchased the 5MP as a gift this year. The S5i has a much bigger and higher quality screen than the 4MP, which makes it easier to decide if you've nailed the shot or not.<br /><br />Overall, I would suggest this camera for a beginner/casual photographer on the go..","This is my first digital camera, and I have only had it for a week. It is extremely small and takes good pictures. I do recommend it, but want to advise you of a few flaws which are getting to me.<br /><br />First is that the on/off switch is next to the shutter and has a green light. This has already resulted in numerous accidental switch offs when a someone else is attempting to take a picture of me. It would have been so easy to put this button on the side, or anywhere else on the body. Really poor design conception.<br /><br />Second is that the shutter has two 'levels' the first of which has almost no use whatsoever. By pressing halfway, the camera gives you a 'preview' of the photo, which is basically useless. Also, the screen locks up when you hit the shutter, despite the 1-2 second lag (depending on the lighting). Why even have this feature?<br /><br />Third, the set-up menu hierarchy is entirely non-sensical. But as a gizmo lover, I have come to expect this shortcoming in most products.<br /><br />Finally, The photo features are somewhat useful, but there is little to no distinction between the images created when using the various modes (flower, surf, sport). Personally, I would prefer an F-Stop and shutter speed indicator, but perhpas that's just me showing my age.<br /><br />Anyway, it tries to be the best of all worlds, but inevitably makes a lot of compromises in the process. Still, I'd buy it again regardless.<br /><br />UPDATE: One month later - So I took the camera on my honeymoon and have now read the manual cover to cover, so I have some revisions and new comments.<br /><br />Please ignore my second comment about the shutter - the two step shutter is to focus the lens. Unfortunately, this camera lacks true 'auto-focus' which is extremely aggravating when you are asking someone to take your picture. Again poor design concept. Conversely, the camera is excellent at self-portraits (if you have long arms like me).<br /><br />Second, the other reviews about needing a second battery (if you are going to use this camera all day) are entirely true. Get two. Also, get the carry bag, there are numerous crevaces which can get filled with schmutz.<br /><br />Third, I am please to say that the camera takes excellent movies with good sound, even at low quality levels. Also, I never compared this to the 4i, but I can say that the 600 x 480 shots on this one are much clearer than others I have seen from friend's cameras at the same resolution.<br /><br />Fifth, the software Pentax included is terrible.<br /><br />I would still buy this again.","I love this camera, in fact I now own 2 of them.  My husband is taking one to Iraq and I am keeping one.  My kids find it really easy to use too.  I would recommend this camera especially to a first time digital buyer.","I have owned almost 10 point-and-shoot digicams. I decided to purchase this camera because my coworker raved about the macro mode. It is necessary to have an exceptional close-up mode for my job--the S5i has a great super macro mode.<br /><br />In terms of size, the camera doesn't quite fit into an altoids tin, which was the case in previous generations. The finish on the body has a hint of lavender, which is a bit tacky. It is odd that the charging base does not allow computer connections. The USB cable connector on the camera body is an unusual shape--it is not intended to be reversible but it might damage easily. I got a PC card reader for the SD card. Overall the body isn't as aesthestically appealing as a Sony T3 or T1 but it is nice and compact.<br /><br />The customizations and the UI are great. It is much better than I expected since I am accustomed to the Sony interface. The buttons are intuitive after getting used to them.<br /><br />In terms of performance, the picture quality is quite good. I like the easy EV balancing. I wish that the continuous mode didn't have so much shutter lag--it's pretty much unusuable. All the other shooting modes are well thought out and I'm intrigued by the marine mode as well as the panaromic mode. I am not sure if the included software works on Mac OSX (the camera works great in iPhoto).<br /><br />Overall, it seems to make the most sense to purchase a camera from a traditional camera manufacturer.","At first I got a little worried about some reviews that I read on amazon pages, but I've decided to try the camera anyway. Well, all I can say so far is that this pentax is a very nice camera for what it is intended to (point and shoot easy-to-carry camera). It's small size makes it easy to slide it into your pants' pockets and forget about it. Remember all those moments you wished you had a camera? Well, I still experience those, but then I remember I have one in my pocket cause these are the only moments you'll remember you're carrying a camera. If I could offer you some advice, I would say, buy it. And be sure to get a good memory card too. I''m using a Lexar 1gb 32x speed, very good and quick. Cheers.","Bought this camera in October based on the positive reviews and wanting to move to digital.  This has been a great camera - Put it in your pocket and take it anywhere, easy to use and better picture quality than the last couple of 35MM cameras I've owned.  The charging station is also very handy and the battery will last for a long time.  Dropped it a few times with no problems.<br /><br />Took this camera to Disney in December for vacation - I ended up taking close to 250 pictures and keeping 140 (which cost @$35 to get prints made).  I have a great shot of the fireworks over the castle which never would have shown with my 35MM.  Nighttime still pictures in the park are great, however night parade pictures just didn't work.  I would definitely buy this camera again, but here are the cons that I've experienced:<br /><br />1)Very low light pictures are virtually impossible to take.  Fine for indoor with lights or outdoor areas with some light.<br /><br />2)There is a noticeable shutter lag, so motion pictures are also very tough to take.  You have to anticipate where the action will be and focus there.<br /><br />3)Video mode is poor - would only use for extreme video emergencies.<br /><br />4)Optical zoom is great, digital is not.","No, it's not the same quality as a larger camera, but it's NOT a larger camera. You buy this camera for ONE reason - acceptable quality in a tiny package. I'm not shooting a National Geographic layout with this thing, mostly shots at Disney and family get togethers.<br /><br />My impression is it does this well. I won't reiterate what others have said, as most of it is on the mark; I will add that I have been surprised at the generally very good quality of our Christmas photos this past week. I compared them to last years film photos and they are at least as good, mostly better... except the Optio's flash is a little weak. But I was able to really clean them up fine in Photoshop Effects. I am also surprised as I've read a lot of \"doom and gloom\" on poor quality with digicams in genaral at ISO's above 100. This one looks about the same as the comparable film output, if not better. So for portability and a camera suitable for family get togethers in a tiny package, this is a good choice.<br /><br />Two tips:<br /><br />1) Buy a \"high speed\" (32x) Secure digital flash memory if shot-to-shot speed is important. Most SD cards only write about 4x.<br /><br />2) Put the focus brackets on the head (or eyes) of the subject, hold the shutter halfway down to lock the focus, then \"frame up\" the subject(s); you'd be surprised at how sharp the focus and how good a photo you will get.","My first impulse was to compare the Optio S5i to my Olympus C-5060 Wide Zoom and then give it only four stars, instead of five.  After all, they are both five megapixel cameras and the image quality from the Olympus is much better.  Then I realized while such a comparison may not be comparing apples to oranges, it is comparing say a Red Delicious to a Granny Smith.  You buy them for different reasons.<br /><br />I bought the Pentax because I want a camera that I could stick in a shirt pocket every morning and forget about until I needed it.  The Optio S5i has more than met that criterion. For that convenience, I am willing to accept images that may be slightly softer in the corners or be somewhat less saturated than the ones I get from my more serious camera.<br /><br />The Optio S5I actually has some very robust features.  Although, it is at heart a point-and-shoot it offers some control in the ability to make manual adjustments to white balance, change focus points, and other exposure control options. The noise levels are exceptionally low for a subcompact digital camera. This is a lot of camera in a very tiny package and can meet the needs of the novice as well as the advanced photographer who wants a camera to knock around with while traveling or kicking back.","Use your head when buying one of these tiny cameras. 5 MP does not mean you are buying a super high res camera. There are 4 MP units with larger lenses that can outperform a camera like this to some degree. I got the Optio S5I as a SECOND camera to supplement the bulky 8 MP Nikon 8800 that I also use.<br /><br />Let me start with the negatives:<br /><br />I think the 1.8 display is so-so at best. You can't judge 100% when a reviewed pic is sharp or not. It shows some noise. Clearly they didn't go crazy over the screen quality.<br /><br />No focus assist lamp for very low light work, but amazing (really!) auto focus system in even dim light.<br /><br />Mediocre movie mode.<br /><br />Button placement is less than intelligent. Some folks will wonder why pentax put the power button next to the shutter release. It's fine once you train your fingers.<br /><br />Cradle does not sync via USB...duh! Why have a cradle at all?<br /><br />Built in memory is just an excuse to ship the camera with no SD card. The built in 10 meg will let you take 3 pics, so buying at least a 256 is a must.<br /><br />Here are the positives....<br /><br />With a little practice the camera can take some wonderful shots. I have taken indoor portraits with no problems. The AF system works very well in low light. Sharpness is better than I expected for such a tiny lens. The camera's size means it can go anywhere, even a shirt pocket. In daylight the Optio excels and there are plenty (19) of scene modes to play with. It also has a built filtering system with 9 colors and even a effects for slimming a subject! The camera also has a Program mode with manual WB, Focus and metering options. It allows for an unusual amount of control for such a compact P&S. You'll even find a manual focus mode that works better than the one on my expensive Nikon. Pentax also sells a tiny remote control (20 bucks) for the camera and a underwater housing!<br /><br />On softness issues: Yes, I can see some softness with the camera at wide, mostly in the corners. You have to shoot a field of wheat to see it at all. It goes away if you just zoom in a bit.  8X10 Prints look FANTASTIC. Looking at ALL of the other cameras, they all have somewhat soft edges and some look soft overall, such as the little Minolta. I see the same kind of softness from the Sony L1 and Casios and the Optio is a smaller camera! If you're looking for a primary unit for \"serious\" or \"ciritcal\" shooting, an ultra compact is not the best way to go.<br /><br />While the cradle has no USB connectivity, it does allow you to charge two batteries at once. Nice.<br /><br />Overall the Optio S5I is well done, but a better screen and ergonomics would have been welcome. Casio sells the Z50 and Z55 which are just a hair larger, but feature better ergonomics. Panasonic has a new camera of the same size (Lx-7) with image stabilization, but the screen quality and battery life appear to be poor compared to the Pentax and Casio. The only other camera I considered was the Sony L1, but it has only 4MP and is too thick for a shirt pocket. A few folks have commented that the Pentax has a more film-like look than other cameras and I agree. Looking at sample pics from Casio, Sony L1, T1, the Pentax looked best. The T1 pics were very sharp, but looked very un-film-like. It's a subjective call obviously. The tiny Panasonic was even better, but I don't want to carry 3 batteries around and the Optio S5I is more than 100.00 cheaper.<br /><br />Camera is actually smaller in height and length than a credit card. It can be tough to hold, but you WANTED a tiny camera! This camera goes into a shirt pocket and only the Panasonic can match it for size. The Casio 100 is even thinner, but 3.2 MP is a deal breaker.<br /><br />If you want the smallest 5MP unit around, I doubt you'll be disappointed in the Pentax, but I'd still hesitate to recommend it as a primary camera simply because a larger lens set will give you better shots for the same money. I'm sure the next versions of all of these cameras will further improve.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />Capt RB","I recently purchased the Pentax Optio S5i and am very satisfied with the it.  I was a previous owner of the Pentax Optio S 3.2MP camera and have always liked the size.<br /><br />As I guy if I had a bulky camera, I would never carry it with me and would miss taking spur of the moment photos. Because of the size of the Optio S5i, I can keep it in my pocket and always am ready for a \"Kodak\" moment.<br /><br />There are a few areas in which I am disappointed.  Let me start by saying that I still would have purchased this camera had I known of these issues before.<br /><br />(1) The on/off button it right next to the button to take a picture.  This can be confusing for the first time user of the camera.<br /><br />(2) When looking through the LCD display to take a photo, it looks very grainy or snowy. Once the picture is taken, the pictures are clear when viewing on the LCD.<br /><br />(3)  I think the USB cable should connect to the docking station.  Right now, you have to insert the cable in the camera itself and when you have it in the docking station, it can be difficult to maneuver.<br /><br />I have noticed other reviews of this camera point out that this camera doesn't have the best quality shots.  This camera is not meant for a professional. If you are a critic or a camera enthusiast, you probably won't be purchasing a camera in this class.<br /><br />If you are a casual user and are style conscious, this camera may be perfect for you.<br /><br />I give this camera 4 out of 5 stars only because there is always room for improvement.","I've been waiting for the 5 megapixel version of this camera ever since I heard about the Optio 4 which supposedly fit in an altoids tin.  This one has the same dimensions, but doesn't quite fit in an Altoids tin.  It is very small though and almost does.  Anyway, I bought this camera for myself and an Olympus Stylus 410 for my friend who didn't need the small size of the Optio.  The 410 was much less expensive and takes way better pictures (despite being only a 4mp camera compared to the 5 of the Optio).  The Optio is very easy to use.  The photo quality is just not good though.  The flash photos are almost always washed out and the non-flash photos are way too red.  Ridiculously red.  I almost want to take the camera back and see if there isn't something wrong with it.  My advice, get an Olympus stylus unless you MUST have a tiny camera.  Maybe there is another one this small out there that takes better pictures.  TRY them before you buy them!  Compare the photo quality.  The other complaint I have with this camera is that the power button is right next to the shutter button.  Before I got used to that, there were several times where I set up a shot and pressed the button and the camera turned off.  Hasn't happened in a while, but still.  Take my advice and test cameras at a store before buying.  It's too much to spend without knowing what you are really getting.  I actually bought mine in a store but didn't really test it out, I just wanted the tiny camera.  Now when my friend and I compare shots of identical things, I'm kicking myself for not getting something else.  Maybe the other Pentax models take better pictures, but the ones coming out of this pale in comparison to the Olympus Stylus.","This is a remarkable camera. I've tried bulky full-functioned cameras and miniature no-frills cameras. But the Optio S5i combines the best of both worlds. The designers have managed to squeeze a wide array of desirable features (such as optical zoom, multiple focus modes, video, and many useful program modes) into a tiny, palm-size package. It is in fact the smallest full-functioned camera I found in an exhaustive search.<br /><br />I went into many electronics stores and hefted all the popular ultracompact cameras, including the Sony Cybershot DSC-T1. But none could match the Optio S5i for sheer compactness and lightness. (Although only the earlier S4i was in stores at the time, I knew its weight and dimensions were the same as the S5i's).<br /><br />Inevitably, there have been compromises: Shooting at full resolution, you have to wait a few seconds between shots while the S5i records data. The life of a battery charge is below average (you'll need to keep an extra battery handy). Noise (speckles and dots) creeps into images taken at the most sensitive ISO settings (200 and 400), a common problem among cameras that capture light with ultra-tiny CCDs.<br /><br />But with patience and practice, I've managed to take some very high-quality photos (technically, I mean--I don't claim to be Ansel Adams). Right now I'm looking at a full-bleed 8 1/2 x 11-inch color print of a whale-watching boat, taken on a sunny day with the zoom at 3X. The focus is razor-sharp, the color is well saturated, and the resolution is extremely high--I can make out individual leaves on trees half a mile away. (I can also vouch for the Canon i560 photo printer, which is no longer made but still available for around $70.)<br /><br />What I like best about the S5i is the convenience. I love to take photos, but always hated carrying a piece of artillery around my neck--I could never participate fully in the events I was photographing. The S5i fits neatly into a shirt pocket. I carry mine around in a little leather pouch attached to my belt. It's no more trouble than wearing a very thin cell-phone pouch. When I need it, I just slide it out of the pouch, power it on, and am ready to shoot in three or four seconds. (By the way, even though I have big hands, I've had no difficulty operating the tiny controls.) The Optio S5i provides something I've never before experienced with a full-featured camera: freedom!","I tried all, starting from Pentax optio s thru Pentax optio s5.<br />Optio s5 won all awards for clearity. color ,sharpness, ease of use.<br />and, fit in your pocket type , very light.you dont know its there. very handy and reliable ,<br />I would recommend it to my best friend.<br />Amazon sells it for 354.00 ,get the small soft leaher pouch , extra battery and at least  256 memory card , check card spec for best performance"]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot A400","amazon_reviews":["I use to H A400 Digital a few days go it quick working so I look online to place my A400 when i came across this I was very please it work right out of the box even so it did not come with the cable to plug in to A USB port to down load pictures Luckily I still had that cable and it did not come with a SD card that was okay to I have about four SD cards and I still had my bookets for the Camera even so I got the extra booklets and the AV cable it works right out of the box and I love this size I can carry it on the trail with my horse take pictures and put it back in my horn bag and or but in my pocket on my shotgun chaps and it is easy to use and very reliable camera  I would still use my old silver with black trim but I had it for 20 years or more and it just quick working I I was able to find another A400","This was a gift for a young child and is a great starter camera.","Dropped the one I'd had for years and lens stopped working.

I was able to express myself and capture amazing moments with this camera. It became my best friend from the moment my father handed it to me Christmas of 2006. It is a GREAT \"first time\" digital camera. Directions, icons, and setup is very easy. Pictures are clear, concise, and can easily be edited with various kinds of software. This camera is great for things such as plants, flowers, family portraits, and macro-style photos. It is also pretty decent with bokeh and light streams. I've yet to have an actual problem with this camera. It's basically like the Buddy Lee of cameras. Not that I've tried, but I have dropped it a few times on accident. Expecting it to come apart or be cracked, there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. My only slight con is this--sometimes the coloring may not be as rich as some newer versions of cameras. Lighting may be a little off, etc. Still, I'm very pleased with this purchase and intend on getting another point and shoot camera once this one has gone away to camera heaven. Well worth the cost.","I received this camera as a company anniversary present 4 years ago.  It has proven to be extremely dependable and is very easy to use.  It is powered by 2 AA batteries.  At first I tried rechargeables but they drained very quickly.  I then tried alkalines but was again unimpressed.  Finally, my wife convinced me to try the Energizer E2 lithiums and I've never looked back.  With those batteries in the camera, I reach the point where I feel the need to replace them \"just in case\".<br /><br />I travel extensively and the camera is always with me.  Last year my wife tried to upgrade me with the Canon A570IS but I keep on with old faithful.  I heartily recommend the Canon family of pocket sized digital cameras for both performance and reliability.","I love this camera so much Im going to buy another one. my whole family loves it.","I have owned this camera for almost 3 years now and I have never had one complaint about it. It takes great pictures and has a lot of features. The camera is small enough that I can carry it in my pocket and easy enough to use that my 4 year old daughter was taking great pictures with it after just a few lessons. I also want to say that I have dropped this camera a few times on the hard concrete and it is very durable. It has never malfunctioned or given me any problems at all. I purchased another one for my girlfriend for Christmas because she loved my camera so much and was always using it when I wanted it. Her camera is also great and I am very happy with both purchases.<br /><br />I won't bore you with all the technical stuff. You can find that elsewhere. I just wanted to say that this is a great camera and if you are thinking about getting it you should.","the camera worked fine but the printer never printed out a pic.  it always came out blank then the ink was empty, i just did not understand how if nothing printed how the ink could run out.  if i could do it again i would just get the camera","owned the camera for three years with no problems, little weak indoors compared to new cameras.  very durable camera, i took this thing around the world and it is still in one piece and takes good pictures.","I love this camera. I bought it for my trip to Paris. I found it very easy to use. One feature i didn't realize it had was video with sound. I found that very useful. I bought a 2GB memory card to go with the camera. The one it comes with doesn't hold that many pictures. The software was easy to install and use. Not really small enough for a pocket but still a great camera on a budget.","First off, let me make it clear that I am satisfied with this camera. I have had it for 8 months now and I have put it through its paces and its held up fine.<br /><br />But there are few things you must know:<br /><br />The camera has no zoom. I mean, practically no zoom. 2.2x may look decent but its pointless in any real-life situation. You WILL find yourself moving a lot with your camera to get a better shot, not standing in one place and using the zoom feature. You can never get a close wide shot - its just not possible with this camera. This camera is great for average stills but that's about it.<br /><br />You have to click twice to take a picture or \"press halfway and then fully\" according to the manual. This is a major pain. Sometimes when the battery is weak, it may take a lot of time to take a picture (and a lot of frustration), so this is not a cam to capture any special pictures or \"kodak moments\".<br /><br />Apart from these cons, the camera is great value for money and offers video and all kinds of stuff. If you're looking mostly looking to take landscape or portrait stills, this camera will do a good job!","I bought this camera six months ago for my 12 year old daughter.  It was her (and ours) first digital camera.  I read so many reviews prior to selecting this model.  The reviews for this camera were so helpful.  This camera has been so easy to use and it takes excellent pictures.  Rechargeable batteries are definitely a must! This camera is the best camera for this price, no doubt about it.  We have taken still shots and videos.  It is so fun to have the option to take a video.  We have some great clips.  All I can say is we are so happy with the camera.  We would definitely choose it again.","Good camera for the $129 I paid. Does everything pretty well, and your picture modes are pretty customizable. Only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than I wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card. Might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures-- but probably wouldn't be doing it with this type of camera anyways.","This is my 3rd digital camera and I bought this one to supplement my larger 10X zoom camera.  This one fits nicely into a pocket  or small camera bag to easily take it to all events or for travel.  I've found that it takes nice photos indoors when the flash is used....Even when the cats or dogs I'm shooting are moving around.  I've felt the life of a battery set is pretty good, but I've been using nice rechargeable ones.  Definitely get a set of 4, then you have 2 to use and 2 as a backup set.  The settings are pretty easy to figure out and change and 99% of my photos were taken on the \"auto\" setting and came out pretty good.  As others have indicated, indoors - without flash - can produce blurry photos, but that's the nature of almost all cameras, not unique to this model.  Glad I bought it and would highly recommend it.","I really like this camera! It is fairly simple to use, takes great pictures and is packed with features. It fits nicely in the hand and is compact enough to slip in a coat pocket or purse.<br /><br />We bought this camera for our daughter's birthday. She is using it with ease & especially loves the movie with sound option. In my opinion, the camera is a winner for any adult or kid wanting a good all around digital camera.<br /><br />My only negative is that it is a battery hog. As with most digital cameras, you will want to make sure you get rechargeable batteries and large memory card.","This camera is an exelent camara. It has plenty of effects, plenty of modes, plenty of scenery options. The image quality is 3.2 megapixel, but its quite good. The pictures you take without the flash do end up getting a bit blury, where as if you take it with the flash, it comes out exelent. And sometimes it takes a long time for the picture to get taken with out the flash, and sometimes it happens imediatly. But all these flaws are only with my version.<br /><br />But if you are looking for a good camera with a great price, this is your best option.","I gave this camera 5 stars because of it's awesome features. This camera is the perfect size for kids and you can put a video on this camera. I love this camera. I think it takes awesome pictures!","Cute, compact, easy to use - these are just a few ways to describe Canon's cool A400! This stylish digital camera is lightweight and perfect for snapping shots on the go. Mine is Sunset Gold.<br /><br /> Plus, there are perks like macro mode (which lets you snap sharp pictures from as close as 2 inches), and lots of shooting modes (like Snow and Fireworks).<br /><br /> And Movie Mode lets you capture video clips with sound.<br /><br /> This camera takes great, crisp photos. It's easy to use, and a great value. Just what you would expect from  Canon.","This camera takes great, crisp photos. It's easy to use, and a great value. Even close-up photos turn out great. You would think this camera had more than 3.2 megapixels! You will have to get a much larger memory card though, as is the case with most digital cameras.","The camera is user-friendly and provides exceptional photos in any setting(light/dark).  It is a good buy for anyone looking for a camera that is not expensive but provides very good quality.","I love this camera.  Small enough to take anywhere and takes great pictures.  I've only had 2 issues with it that should be considered when purchasing this camera.<br /><br />1) I find often I have to reshoot images because I'm not still enough when taking a picture.  I do my best to stay perfectly still, but the slightest twitch seems to give the photo that motion blur.  I've tried about every setting possible to adjust, but nothing has helped.<br /><br />2) Not very good in dim light.  The camera takes BEAUTIFUL pictures outdoors, but pictures taken inside usually end up very washed out and often the flash is too much light.  I often have to take the image into photoshop and play with the image to fix it up a bit.","I really don't know much about digital cameras and I'm more of a \"Point and Click\" photo taker. I loved the ease of using the camera, overall. What amazed me the MOST was the quality of the pictures that I received. I took a 3-week trip to Greece and using the camera captured the moments perfectly, well almost perfectly. The only types of pictures that didn't come out that well were night pictures. I guess I need to read the manual more. Otherwise they turned out AWESOME. I uploaded a few for you to preview. Like any digital camera, it does eat up batteries but I'd rather that than taking pictures and them not turning out!!!! Based on the reviews I did purchase the warranty \"in case\" but I have had no problems! Very satisfied!","I bought the A400 after many hours of research, where I debated the balance of features to price. In the end I got the A400 because it looked like a low cost, basic camera that would be easy to use in the everyday life situations I wanted it for. It has not disappointed. Perfect for those quick snapshots of life, when all you want is to point and shoot, not worry about activating the superFeature 500000A.","I bought this camera as a gift for a relative.  They were very pleased with it.  Its compact size and light weight make it easy to take anywhere.  The picture quality is great for taking fun snapshots of friends and family.  The manual was pretty simple to understand.  I guess the only problem I would have with it is the same as with almost any digital camera and that is battery life. I would definitely recommend rechargeable batteries..","My brother bought me this camera for my birth day but it is very inpressive. it has taken many beatings, (i dropped it alot) and nothing happened! it works PERFECTLY!!!! the quality of my pics are sweet, and it has 7 times zoom. there is a mode where you can take a spesific picture, like if you have different light sources, (like natural, florecent, and tungsten) you can adjust the white ballace to make the pic just right. and you can tell the camera that your indoors or out, or if your making a portrait or takeing a pic of foolige. this camera dose many things to make your pics perfect. dont settel for a cheep one like those 20 dolla ones at wall mart, this is MUCH BETTER!!!! the movie mode is very fun to. you can adjust the quality, for example, if your only recording a 10 second thing, it will be highter quality if you put it under that setting. it may be a little difficult, at first but than its a snap. and the lcd display is very handy to have<br /><br />Over all this is the coolest camera in the WORLD!!! (other than those thousand dolla ones)","This camera has everything for the money. There is only one drawback - it draws too much current and uses batteries way too<br /><br />fast. It's a great feature to be able to use regular size (AA) batteries, but i had to purchase rechargable ones to save money.<br /><br />Other then that it's a great buy.","It's a nice camera, easy to use, the color is orange but not so much.","This is my first digital camera, a Christmas gift from my parents.  I think it combines what both of us were looking for: a relatively cheap price for my parents, and a reliable, easy to use camera for me.  I have had little trouble teaching my parents and their friends how to use this camera, while \"older\" people may struggle with other technology.<br /><br />Since the other reviews seem to sum everything up nicely, I just want to say that Canon has EXCELLENT customer service.  I was able to get someone on the phone in about five minutes when my LCD screen broke, and they gave me clear details on what to do and how to ship it to them.  The generous warantee covered the repairs, even though I'm pretty sure it was my own fault that it broke (I left the camera in my car in the middle of winter and the crystals froze togeher and cracked).  They sent it back promptly and fixed it for free.","OK, the shot-to-shot delay is a bit long, and the 640x480 video mode only goes for 30 seconds and only records at 12 fps.  Also the flash is a bit weak.  But consider the price, the quality of the images (very nice), the good battery life, and the fact that it is a Canon.  It adds up to a great starter camera, especially for a kid.  I got one for my 11-year-old grandson and he loves it.  He now edits his own still and video images and is producing movies.","This has been a wonderful camera. It takes wonderful pictures in both the day time and at night. I have used it to mostly to send pictures to fiance in Iraq and has served it's purpose. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for an inexpensive camera with a lot benefits.","I bought the A400 to replace my old 1 megapixel HP Photosmart 120. The main selling points were the price, picture quality, and the brand. (I already own a Canon scanner and printer.)<br /><br />Pictures taken outside in bright light came out very clear with a lot of detail. The camera offered more manual settings than I expected, but not as much as one of the higher end cameras that are out of my budget.<br /><br />The camera feels solid and the controls are well laid out. The lens has a cover that closes automatically when the lens is off, it has a dedicated touch button, and vibrant LCD screen.<br /><br />Canon provides quite a few programs, include PhotoStitch to stitch together panoramic photos, and a remote control program to control your camera from the computer, both of which work adequately.<br /><br />Overall a good compact point & shoot camera with a really nice price tag and a good reputation.","I teach at a middle school and we are transitioning into the digital world.  I personally own a Canon Powershot A70 and love it, so when I went looking for a quality, but cheaper digital camera I looked first at Canon.  It is perfect for what I want it to do.  I can hand it to students to walk around school and not cringe that they are going to drop and break a $400 camera.<br /><br />The Camera is just your basic point and shoot camera.  I have read a lot of reviews that state the indoor pictures or zoom did not work for them, but I strongly disagree.  I have used it and found the pictures turn out just great.  (pictures in a gymnasium rarely turn out well unless you have a brightly light gym or a SLR camera), and the digital zooms on any digital cameras basically suck.<br /><br />I am planning on buying three more next year for yearbook unless Canon releases a newer version at the same or similar price.<br /><br />Bottom line, the camera is very basic, but very good at what it does.","This is not my first camera - I have an old sony cd mavica 200 with a low 2.1mp that is 3 years old, but wanted something smaller I could have for those \"spontaneous\" kid moments.  This is perfectly satisfactory in some cases.<br /><br />Outdoors, the photos are crisp and can produce great action shots.  I have shots of my daughter in the middle of a full out run, as well as in the middle of sliding down a slide that have great clarity, even with magnification.  I've even gotten good shots in the car.<br /><br />Indoors, I've had no success with the red eye function on this camera, and anything set on zoom has fuzzy edges.  I took shots of my daughters spring program that are covered with little glowing eyes in every child.  All zoomed shots are gritty in appearance, and are muted in tone.  I can get the color back to where it should be with software that can increase the sharpness and color, but never had to do that with my old reliable sony.  I feel this is a unique artifact that may be improved with the flash as others have mentioned.<br /><br />Yes, this camera has limitations, but the price is great and the shots are wonderful for outdoors.","This camera takes beautiful pictures when there is lots of light. You can't stay close to your subject, otherwise it won't fit in the picture. Well, when you're not close enough, flash won't be effective. Pictures taken in low light situations take a long time to process while the LCD goes blank.<br />Pros:<br />- Cheap<br />- Really good pictures when there is enough light<br />Cons:<br />- Weak flash and bad low light pictures<br />- Narrow angle lens (45-100)<br />- Windows does not recognize it as a storage device as it did with my old Sony P93, so no drag and drop, you have to use a software to transfer images<br />- Buttons and menus not very well designed unlike my P93<br />- Slow menu, sometimes it takes up a couple seconds after pressing a key in the menu to see the change<br />- Generally slow operation but ok when there is light<br />- Focus assist lamp not very powerful<br /><br />Compared to my old Sony, color saturation and sharpness is better whereas worse in all other areas. It has to be expected because it's around half as cheap, I guess (and that's why I changed it with this)","This is such a good deal for what it costs, I'd be suprised if Canon has any competition left in this market in the next few<br /><br />years.  It has everything: you can make some pretty fine adjustments, yet *anyone can pick it up and shoot a picture by simply pressing the ON button and the big button on top. (I know this, my wife has taken great  pictures with it.)<br /><br />Rechargable batteries last forever.<br /><br />I purchased an HP before getting this A400.  The HP cost $20 less, but it was worth nothing.  It ate batteries like we breathe air.  It could not take a picture indoors that didn't come out a mess.  It wasn't even heavy enough to make a good paperweight.  It was a cheap toy.<br /><br />The pictures from the Canon are a perfect compromise for the consumer for whom 3MP is enough: optical zoom, seamless file<br /><br />transfers in XP, NONE of the features get in the way.<br /><br />*PROS:<br /><br />Easy<br /><br />Powerful<br /><br />Cheap<br /><br />Efficient<br /><br />Comes in like 8 colors<br /><br />Did I miss anything?<br /><br />*CONS:<br /><br />Light weight, afraid it might not survive a fall to the floor.<br /><br />B U Y -  T H I S - O N E","I bought this camera for work because the 'form factor' is right -- fits nicely in a cell phone holster (from Lowes or Home Depot) that I wear on my belt.  I work with rotating equipment (pumps, fans, compressors, etc) and by accident I discovered that this camera will \"freeze\" a rotating shaft perfectly.  I've done this anywhere from 200 rpm to 7400 rpm and the detail is absolutely amazing.<br /><br />As pointed out by others, the flash IS weak, but it does a good job if you are up close, even in total darkness.  The auto focus is fantastic.  I will quite often stick the camera into a hole where I can't even see what I'm photographing, and with the camera set it multi-snap mode (or whatever it's called), just snap off a few pictures.  One of them is nearly always perfect.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, it is not good for action (sports) shots unless you pan the camera with your subject.<br /><br />This might not be the ONLY camera you'd want to have, but it's ONE you should have, especially if you work in an industrial plant somewhere.  I like it so much (for work) that I bought a spare, because whatever they replace it with probably won't have the ability to freeze moving parts.","I'm not really interested in expounding in Proustian language on the pros and cons of a $149 camera, but here's what I've learned and why I sold my A400.<br /><br />Previously had a 6 megapixel camera; I sold that one because it had too many features. I just wanted to take a (...) picture. My first experience with this camera, then, was a great one: went out to a ranch, took pictures of a sunset. I didn't have to worry about setting it on sun-about-to-set mode or any number of extravagances I didn't need: just took a picture.<br /><br />Well, that's fine as it goes, but it came time a few weeks ago when I needed this bad boy for a work function. Big mistake. The indoor pictures at low-light were horrific, hardly useable, and I had to explain why the pictures that we took [were bad] to a corporate sponsor. Not good.<br /><br />So I went with a Nikon 5900, a little bit more difficult to use, maybe, double the price, but brilliant photos everytime. Buyer beware on this camera if you need it for anything other than meaningless photos.","This is a big mistake by canon. In this day and age why canon does not let you date stamp on all image resolution is beyond me. For some strange reason, Canon restricts date stamping only in the postcard mode (1600x1200 fine) which is 2 megapixel resolution. To many people this is an very important feature as we are not professional photographers. We just want to have snapshots of memories and date stamping is very important. If I  want date stamping, then this A400 is not a 3 megapixel but only a 2 megapixel camera. At first I thought only the A400 does not date stamp as it is the cheapest, I was very suprised to find out the A75 and A95 also lack full-range date stamping. Nikon, Kodak and Sony all offer the unrestricted date stamping option. Why is Canon lagging behind the competition in this department? For this reason alone, I am returning this camera and buying something else.<br /><br />While the shots are not blurry, they can do better. They are not as sharp as the photos I took with the sony DSC-W1 .","i am not a professional photographer and i dont know alot about cameras, but what ever i have taken photos of so far have been fantastic. once i read the instructions and played with it for a while, i got to know which settings are right for each situations. i have taken pics of hockey players flying down the ice and they come out looking as if he were not moving at all, i print them out 8.5 by 11 and get them autograped and framed, they look professional. indoor pics are superb and outdoor pics are superb. the zoom is great also, the pic looks grainy and not to good sometimes on the camera screen, but when i get it on the computer, its great. your going to need good batteries for it thoughi bought some duracell rechargeble batteries, it came with 4 batts. and the charger for 40.00 at best buy, they also have a car adapter for it to.","This camera has features I never even knew existed! It's awesome. Every picture comes out perfectly clear...you can take a picture of a car flying by and it'll look like it was parked in a parking space, you can take a picture of a ceiling fan on high and it'll look like the fan was turned off......It's Great!!","A lot of people leave feedback who don't really know much about digital photography or equipment, and that's fine, and beneficial in many cases, but in other cases it can be very misleading. For instance, a woman said she took some photos in the gymnasium of her kids and the quality of the photos was very poor so she's returning the camera. I'll bet the gym had little or no sunlight, and she was shooting at a distance OUTSIDE OF THE CAMERA'S FLASH RANGE. Grain is created in by higher ISO speeds (film speeds). This camera's highest ISO speed is 400 which isn't really high enough to create grainy photos. So I'm assuming her photos turned out yellowish or blurry, which some people wrongly call grainy. You need to tell the camera what kind of light source you're shooting under. She should have switched the camera mode to \"indoor lighting, florescent or tungsten depending on the lights in the gym\", and I'll bet she would have been quite impressed with the results as long as there was plenty of artificial light available. If there wasn't enough light she could have played with the exposure setting a little (see the user manual for that advanced feature). Or she possibly could have used her flash, but the flash range is probably around 10 feet which could be a problem in a gym.<br /><br />Ok, now another person left feedback saying there is a two second lag time between when you click the button and the shutter snaps. Please dont be concerned. There is no lag time, I can assure you. There is however a two second timer on the camera (and also a 10 or 20 second timer, not sure which one). Anyway, he has the two second timer selected which is causing the lag time. I hope he reads the manual and figures out what he's doing wrong before he returns this wonderful camera ;)<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a great camera. Here is why:<br />1. This camera uses the DiGiC image processor. All you need to know is the image processor is crucial for a high quality digital reproduction for any digital camera. Canon's DiGiC processor is the best compact camera image processor on the market and this is the same one they use in their high end compact cameras costing 100s of dollars or more.<br />2. This camera is very flexible because it allows you to shoot in different modes by basically flipping a switch to the proper setting - indoor lighting, portrait, landscape, and so on. These settings make any photographer take great pictures. Yes, these modes are standard on pretty much any good compact camera. But this camera costs a lot less so the point is you're still getting tons of high end features.<br />3. The auto focus capabilities are great. Make sure you understand when your subject is in focus. This camera does all the complex focusing work for you. You just need to understand what the camera is telling you about the subject it's focusing in on. That's true for any camera, but this camera has 9 point evaluative metering, and that's an advanced focusing mode perfected by canon in even their high end cameras.<br />4. Automatic Exposures vs. Manual - This camera ships with automated settings selected (for best exposures without you having to understand all the technicalities of photography) to make your life easier. Yet if you want control over your exposure the camera allows you lots of flexibility for the price.<br />5. Display - The display on the back of the camera is superb and more expensive cameras on the market do not have as good a display.<br />6. *3.2 Mega pixels - Some people think more is better, but that's not true. Photos taken with this camera can be printed at 5x7 size with photo quality. If you want to print 8x10s with this camera, the quality is still excellent. That's basically true for any 3.2 mega pixel camera. However, the quality of the DiGiC image processor combined with 3.2 mega pixel resolution means this camera will make up to 5x7 prints with better color quality, clarity, sharpness etc than that $600.00 compact camera offered by another brand (because other brands don't have Canon's DiGiX image processor and optics). If you want to print really large photos, 11x14 or larger then this camera is not for you. But generally... anyone who's interested in those sized prints is going to buy a higher end SLR for at least $1,000.<br /><br />This camera defies the old saying, \"you get what you pay for\". This is a high quality camera that Canon is able to offer for far less cost because they've limited it to 3.2 mega pixels. But most consumers don't understand that it's totally irrelevant unless they're trying to print really large prints (11x14 or larger)<br /><br />Everyone should buy this camera (and learn how to use it before leaving feedback ;)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Small memory card. You'll need to buy a 128MB or higher card. You'll pay $20 + for that depending on what kind of deal you can find.<br />2. Batteries. Your batteries will start dying after about an hour of use or so. You should get 4 NiCad rechargeable batteries and a charging unit. That way when one pair dies the other pair is fully charged. I bought a charger kit w/ four AA batteries for about $30.00.<br />3. Plastic - This camera is fairly sturdy and can probably take a little banging around, but its plastic so be careful. The plastic battery door is connected to the body with hinges which is great for not misplacing/losing it, but I'm concerned about the plastic hinge breaking.<br />4. Speed of things - The speed of this camera is fine. When you click the button a photo is take fairly quickly. If you bought a more expensive camera it would be faster. Most people just take a picture and that's it, so it doesn't really matter if the camera is super fast. When was the last time you needed to take 10 pictures in 3 seconds? Even more advanced photographers will pay more for speed and then never really need it. Yet, this camera would be improved if it was faster, but then it would probably cost more ;)<br /><br />So there you go. My advice to beginners - read the manual. Try to understand when your image is in focus, and how to select for indoor and outdoor lighting. And learn the different picture modes for taking portraits, landscapes, close-up of things like a flower or insect, etc. Don't worry about complex features because the camera is smart, and can automatically choose the best complex settings for you.","I use these cameras professionally in the Architectural Forensic Business this is a great no-nonsense machine at an affordable price.<br /><br />Canon cameras are like Nokia phones; once you get used to them and their Software they become very reliable. I have had this Camera for approximately 6 months and I use it a lot, its easy to carry and quick to activate it also proves sturdy and reliable (I have dropped mine a few times).<br /><br />The only faults I can find with this particular model as a good all-rounder is that the on off button sometime demonstrates to be a little delicate and over responsive it is easy to turn the thing on and off again at the same time. Large cards e.g above 250mb take a while to save especially when you have over 200 snaps at 1mb each. The stitch assist feature takes a while to master.<br /><br />This Camera makes high definition professional prints up to A4 and that is enough for most of the most demanding picture takers!","Overall, a really good camera. Easy to use (some functions are a little difficult to get to, but nothing a little getting used to won't solve). Picture quality is great. It feels solid and well made, even has some metal parts.<br /><br />Con:<br /><br />Time between shots is pretty long. Like another reviewer mentioned something like 6 seconds if you are using the flash. Everything else gets a big thumbs up.","I sold my Canon A60 and decided to buy this Canon A400 instead. Canon's product never disappointed me.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Great printing quality<br /><br />Compact size<br /><br />Movie mode at 640*480 with sound<br /><br />Manual control<br /><br />Great battery life (2AA battries last over 100 pics with flash and screen on at all time, 2200mAh recharable battery recommended)<br /><br />Little mirror in the front allows you to do portrait mode<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Very lag of shutter speed (up to 6 seconds with flash)<br /><br />Battery door is very breakable<br /><br />Overall, buy it. It's great cam for the price and you won't regret it!","I just brought this camera and I am very happy with its performance. I particularly liked the special scene mode and special effects. I took a shot in a low lighting condition and I could not believe to my eyes, the photo quality was just amazing. The only thing to worry about is the battery life and good rechargeable batteries should do fine. With its great price tag and amazing features, Powershot a400 is definitely a GREAT buy.","I bought this camera on impulse, and am very pleased with it. The flash is amazing, I took a picture in a pitch black room and it picked up every detail.  It's got great shutter speed, and is very easy to use. It connected very simply to my iBook G4 and uploaded straight into iPhoto. Even though it only has 3.2MP the quality of the photos are great. I can't wait to take this camera on vacation. Great buy!","I have checked different digital cameras in past two years and have worked with some of them. The problem most of digital cameras suffer from one way or another is that they don't function well in indoor settings or low light situations. Powershot a400 has almost solved this problem and its function in indoor settings is really great. You just have to bear in mind to buy rechargable life long batteries and 128 MB or more memory cards.<br /><br />I enjoy all features,all of them come handy under different conditions.","For the price you pay, this camera is very easy to use, and the quality is very good.  I would recommend this to folks looking for a solid camera.  The zoom is not the greatest, but not a real problem -- just make sure to turn the digital on -- I don't think that is an automatic setting.  The only drawbacks I found is the short battery life, and the 16MB memory.  If you buy this camera, buy longer life batteries and more memory.  The 16MB only got me 13 photos.","Just a short review to basically reinforce what the previous reviewer said about this great little camera.<br />I can honestly reccommend this canon very highly, all of the features that you loved<br />from passed canon digitals are here and it works really quickly.<br />There is one small qualm tho, the battery life is short (the batteries supplied are virtually useless, be sure to buy some highpowered duracell for best battery life)<br /><br />I bought this camera from Frys in Austin TX, and my friend bought the canon powershot a75, and i honestly cannot see the advantage of having the a75 other than the manual settings are more accessible and the lens is interchangeable, if you are into lens' then you should be buying an SLR, if you are into high quality fun photography, get the a400, its a winner, also the lcd is AMAZING quality.<br />The best camera i have ever bought, get it.","I own the Canon Powershot A80, the Olympus D-540 and just purchased 2 units of this new Canon Powershot A400 camera for my two friends 3 days ago for our upcoming journey to middle-earth (New Zealand) after reviewing its features on the internet.<br /><br />The manual states that it is capable of 100 shots using 2 AA alkaline batteries with the LCD on, but rechargeables especially NiMH 2300 mAH and above, are really the way to go.<br /><br />It has a 2.2x optical zoom instead of the standard 3x zoom, but I've found that photos taken with the digital zoom (max 7x) are also quite acceptable and not too bad as one might imagine. The wideangle end at 45mm equiv. may not be wide enough for scenic shots, so the friendly Stitch Assist feature in the camera will definitely come in handy to capture panoramic scenes.<br /><br />The camera has so many features similar to the A80 such as ability to customise start-up image and sounds, (similar to changing Microsoft Windows theme) until it becomes a really 'fun' camera to use. Fancy a howling wolf as your self-timer sound, or perhaps a loud 'woof' as your camera shutter sound? The included cd has even more selections for you to upload to the camera, and you can even upload sounds/images of your own, once you configured them to meet the required specifications.<br /><br />It is an easy to use camera in the Auto mode, and the 8 new Special Scene Modes should be able to handle most situations. A Manual mode is also available, and Canon has included so many other features and options, such as 2 autofocus modes, 3 light metering modes, histogram, custom white balance, sound memos, movies with sound, AF-assist beam etc. which makes it really feature-rich. The 1.5 inch LCD screen with 115k pixels also delivers a noticeably sharper and finer image quality than the 65k pixels on the Canon A80 and the 85k pixels on the Olympus.<br /><br />Over the past 3 days I have taken numerous photos with this camera to test its picture quality, and the 'Vivid' mode reminded me of photographic slide films, since the pictures taken under this mode are really sharp and colorful.<br /><br />There are 4 resolution settings (3.2Mp, 2.0Mp, 1.0Mp & VGA) at 3 compression levels ('Superfine','Fine','Normal') plus a special 'PostCard' setting (which allows date/time imprinting on photos). The 3.2Mp setting at 'Superfine' obviously yields the best picture quality, but finishes off your SD memory card mighty quick too (76 shots on a 128Mb SD card). Since I know my friends will be mostly printing 6 x 4 in. postcard-sized prints, I have performed some tests at the appropriate 2.0Mp settings. In comparing photos of same subjects taken under the 'Fine', 'PostCard' and 'Normal' compression settings, I have noted that the difference in picture quality is hardly noticeable, and therefore the 'Normal' setting is virtually as good as the 'PostCard' or 'Fine' setting. I will certainly be recommending this 'Normal' setting to my two friends, as they will then be able to take 403 shots of middle-earth on their 128Mb SD card, instead of 212 shots at the 'PostCard' or 'Fine' setting.<br /><br />Overall, this camera takes great pictures, and very colorful ones too under the 'Vivid' mode. Discounting the slightly shorter 2.2x optical zoom, the rest of its features are really out of proportion to its budget price, and it is certainly one of the better buys coming from an established camera brand."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot A95","amazon_reviews":["Although it is a used camera, it is a good condition.

I had an older model and it broke and very happy I found this one","I bought this camera in 2004 and it has had light usage.  Its features and functions are good, but around 2010 the camera stopped working.  There was a known issue with the CCD sensor that Canon acknowledged was faulty.  I was able to return the camera to Canon and get it repaired for free.","I bought this camera in ~2004. It was my first digital camera, I chose it because it took AA batteries, it had a metal case, a flip screen, decent macro, and the lens retracted. Loved this camera - but it kept getting purple streaks (after five years of use). Canon repaired it for free (even replaced a part of the case that had a dent in it while they were at it). Customer service was great, especially considering it was a few years after I had bought it and I assumed I'd be paying for repairs. Unfortunately, the purple lines returned less than a month later. It was ~2010 at this point, and I went out and bought a \"better\" camera (Canon Powershot SX20IS) and although the camera had better features - I got better pictures out of the Canon A95. I barely ever used the flash with the A95 and my pictures turned out great most of the time. The Powershot it a pain to set up (auto on that camera is terrible) and the pictures don't look as nice. I wish I could find a camera I like as much as the A95!","This is the second time I have provided a review of the Canon Powershot A95 that I purchased a few weeks ago.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  It was shipped promptly and packed very well to avaoid any damage when shipped.  I previously owned a Canon Powershot A95 and really like the camera and the program.","I got this camera as a present about 5 years ago, and I took it with me everywhere! The swivel screen allows for me to take good pictures of myself with friends without the hassle of turning the camera around to make sure it was a good picture or not. This camera has been to the beach and back, been dropped numerous times, been chewed on by a puppy and it's still going strong. The sand stuck in it has made the lens a little slow in opening, but other than that it still works great. The only reason I don't have it anymore is because my husband bought me a Canon Rebel for Christmas, so I gave the A95 to my sister-in-law. I'm a little bummed I don't have it anymore because I can't take the Rebel to the beach...","I have had the Powershot A95 for about 4 or 5 years now, and despite a few scratches on the case it still looks & operates great. Now it is a little sluggish compared to todays lightning fast compacts, but it's true that they don't make 'em like they used to.<br /><br />A few months ago I started seeing something weird when I used the camera. Now, it didn't do it all the time, only occassionally. When composing my shot using the lcd screen (live view), the lcd screen would distort, almost appearing like it was placed next to something magnetic. Strange waves of green, and a digitized looking picture took over the screen. This distortion did'nt just stop at the lcd screen. This effect was recorded onto the image as well.<br /><br />I thought the camera was officially a paper weight, but then I got on amazon and found reviewers discussing the same thing. I checked out Canon's website and after searching for my make and model of camera, I found an alert about the distorted lcd screen. Apparently, Canon purchased a batch of CMOS sensors from Sony around the time this and several others cameras were produced. Well, some of those sensors were faulty. So Canon will fix them for free. I just called their 1-800 number and spoke to a very nice woman who set me up with a UPS shipping label. I mailed the camera off, and recieved an email in a few days saying that the camera was eligible for the fix and that it would be fixed shortly. Then, the very next day, I got an email saying that the camera had been fixed! Very impressive. They apparently replaced the CMOS sensor. I got the camera in about 2 days, and it looked exactly as it did when I sent it.<br /><br />Overall, I was VERY impressed with their promptness and service. So if your A95 is doing the same thing, get ahold of Canon and give your camera a new lease on life.","I got this camera in 2005 and took it to many trips. It still takes better/cleaner pictures in low ISO than today's 10+ MP cameras due to its large sensor and low pixel density. Of course it does not have the high ISO capability nor image stabilization, etc.<br /><br />Recently the CCD was having some problems and Canon repaired free of charge regardless of warranty status (search the web for Canon CCD service advisory). They also fixed the zoom lever for free too.<br /><br />I got an Canon S95 for my compact use recently and this camera goes to someone without a camera.","The Canon A series are fantastic! We had a A80 for six years and loved it. We purchased the optional dive shell for ~$150 from Canon and used the camera above and below the surface to take AWESOME pictures--- I wanted to submit two lobster pics. (underwater)to National Geographic they were so good! Unfortunately after six years with a lot of abuse (dropped 4-5 times on concrete) our A80 started getting fuzzy so we upgraded to the A95 and love it as well. Same body, so it fits our underwater housing but it has even MORE features. Great camera! Congrats. to Canon--- I'm sorry to see they phased them out for slightly smaller models. If you can get your hands on a new or slightly used A80 or A95--- DO IT!!","Camera arrived in very good conditions and quickly. We are pleased of it. we had a similar one which had broken and we decided to buy the same model. Have alredy the accessories.","The battery access door on the original Canon PowerShot A95 broke, and we could not find anyone to repair it, so were pleased to find one for sale. It arrived in perfect condition, and has replaced the original. We already had a large memory card for it, so the in-between one that it came with became the backup, and we have some duplicate accessories (strap, etc.), but otherwise this was a good solution.","I bought the Powershot A95 about 4 years ago as a replacement for another Canon camera which stopped working after about 18 months. What can I say--i like Canon cameras, so I bought the A95 and I've been very pleased with it.<br /><br />About 2 weeks ago, I turned it on and the LCD monitor image was blurred---like a carnival house of mirrors. Pictures I took were also similarly blurred.<br /><br />I immediately checked Amazon reviews to see if anyone else was having a problem, and came up with a very informative post by a reviewer who said to check this link...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I did, and the symptoms seem to match mine, so I called Canon support and after going through a couple of easy tests, the representative told me to send the camera into Canon to have them check it out. They provided me with a postage paid UPS label---all I had to do was remove the accessories (batteries, camera card, strap) and take it to a UPS store.<br /><br />After only about 1 week, I received an email yesterday indicating that the problem does indeed seem related to a known controller problem, and that Canon is fixing it and should ship it in about 7 business days.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the camera worked very well for 4 years, stopped working, and that Canon is fixing it at their expense due to a controller problem.<br /><br />The camera gets 5 stars, Canon support also gets 5 stars.","Actually this is my second A95. My first one which I bought 2004 did not disappoint me. This camera is so good especially when I use it underwater with its canon underwater casing.

The response of the camera is too too slow after you have clicked ... sometimes u might want to know if the camera is actually working or not.<br /><br />Unfortunately this camera stopped working today after 3 years.. I dont know whether to revive it by paying 97 dollar for repair or buy a new one.. Not sure how all of a suddenly it stopped working ..this is strange and unexpected from a great camera.<br /><br />But the greatness of this camera overcomes all this risk. and i would recommend this camera.","I bought this thing for a vacation trip a couple of years ago.  Its still going strong.  Turned out some great pictures from Christmas.  I've used Sony rechargeable batteries with good success.  My favorite feature other than the overall ease of use is the movable Display which allows you to take pictures from many angles.  Canon seem to be the ones to beat.  I guess there are more features and megapixels to be had with the newer cameras, but until this one dies, I can't see myself wanting to change.  Well worth what I spent for it.","I started with the classic Nikon FTN in 1969, and I swear this is absolutely the easiest and best to use camera that I've ever owned.  I've abused the stuffings out of it, and it just keeps on ticking!  There is an after market flash deflector you can find on ebay that is really handly in using the flash on close up shots without getting flash burn.  You can spend $100s more and never be able to tell the difference if you aren't a professional.  Love it!","I've had this cam for several months now and I'd buy a Canon power anything again. This cam is great and now its a lot less to buy one. Actually, you can find a better model for less than I paid cause the prices have really come down. Am glad I bought this one and have not even come close to using it to its potential. Go Canon...","Buena camara, funciones muy buenas, lo único malo es el peso por las 4 pilas que utiliza","I have been using this camera for well over a year and have found no problems with it. I get great pictures either at work or play. I have taken over 1500 pictures. The fold out viewer a great plus.","I love my camera. Here's why:<br /><br />1. The pop-out screen. Perfect when you are in a crowd. You can just tilt the screen, rais your arms and you KNOW what you'll be shooting. (Rather than just shooting blindly.)Also, to get the kids/pet shots. You tilt the screen up and you can shoot from your waist or knees without having to bend uncomfortably. The con: It probably makes the camera a bit chunkier, but to me it's worth it.<br /><br />2. The pixel size. It's around 5MP and it is just right for all-around shooting. It isn't too small where I lose details but it isn't too big where I'm having to always free up space on my computer. The con: I would prefer more MP's but, for this camera, it will do fine.<br /><br />3. The controls. I found that it is simple enough for all-around 'point & shoot' shots but it also has features that you can control. I choose to use my manual shutter and aperture settings to control my pictures. But if I hand my camera to somebody who has no idea how to use one, they could just hit the button and shoot. The con: The settings can seem to overwhelm the beginner...at first, but after reading the manual for a bit, it should help with that.<br /><br />4. The size. I am comfortable with it's size. But I know many would prefer a smaller one. (I guess that would be the con of it.) It feels solid and well made. The screen is not too small and the lense does a decent job in getting the shots you want. I use a cushioned carrying case for it and it can be a bit bulky BUT I'd rather protect it with something like that. This can be a bit chunky for your pocket but it can still fit. (Don't forget to grab yourself a camera strap for added protection against drops!)<br /><br />5. Canon. I've owned Canons for a while and that is the brand I will stick to. I found that they are well made and the cameras are awesome. This one is a favorite. I can take it anywhere. Hopefully you will too.<br /><br />Enjoy!","After reading the literally hundreds of positive reviews for Canon cameras generally, and this one in particular, I bought one after our older Kodak DC3400 finally died.<br /><br />When the pictures are good, they are very good with this camera.  It seems though that I can take more bad pictures in one weekend than I did through 5000 pictures with the old Kodak - blurry images, and in dim light or dusk settings, lots of red eye.<br /><br />Love the fact that it uses AA batteries though, makes it easy to replace if the batteries die and we can't recharge them.","I bought this Camera in December 2004, based on top-notch ratings. And I have few complaints. I don't take a lot of pictures. I hadn't taken more than 150 in 18 months time.<br /><br />I've been very happy with it though. The pictures come out great.<br /><br />I decided on Canon because they are known to have the best Linux compatibility. However, it didn't dawn on me at the time that the computer I had just bought has a media card reader. Therefore Linux compatibility is not an issue.<br /><br />Any OS can handle media card readers and it's much simpler to pop the card into the reader than hook up a USB cable.<br /><br />I do wish I'd done more research on media types. If I were buying today, I'd pay more attention to the Canons that take the much smaller (in size) SD Media cards. For some reason that media is often half the price of the CF media that the A95 takes.<br /><br />The cameras that take the SD media often come with rechargeable batteries that are smaller too. The Canon A95 does not come with batteries. It just uses plain old AA batteries (I've since bought rechargeable AA batteries to use with it).<br /><br />The point to all this is that the bigger batteries and flash memory make it heaver and bulkier. I must say though, that I actually do like the the idea of AA batteries. I find that more convenient then the built-in rechargeable types. The trade-off of course, is the size they add to the camera and the expense. But since I take few pictures, that's not a problem.<br /><br />The image quality is excellent. 5 Megapixels gives you a lot of image to play with if you with to crop/edit and then produce a 4x6\" or 8x10\" image for printing.<br /><br />If you want to tweak settings for your particular environment, the A95 gives you quite a few options. Most of these I'll probably never bother with. \"Auto\" has worked out quite well so far.<br /><br />One of my favorite things is the 1.8\" LCD on the back. It's good sized AND it folds out so you can turn it around facing forward. That comes in handy for \"self portraits\". There's no guesswork involved like with most cameras.<br /><br />That's probably the single biggest feature for me. It's how I finally decided on this model (I suppose that's another trade-off for the bigger size of the camera now that I think about it).<br /><br />And even better (for you anyway). It's dropped in price. I bought it in December 2004 on Amazon.com. As of this writing (June 2005), it's almost half the the price I paid for it.<br /><br />I'm sure that's due to the newer models Canon has since come out with. I suppose the A95 is near the end of it's life cycle. Frankly I think this is even more reason to get this camera. It's a great value.<br /><br />The Canon A95 is a great all-around camera for those who like \"point-and-shoot\" cameras that offer more than just standard features, options and settings.","I loved this camera. Other than small LCD, I liked everything on it.<br /><br />It would have been better if that battries were Li-Ion. Its pain to carry a separate battery pack or charger..","It is an easy to use great 5 MP camera, with the advantage of its full auto and full manual mode.<br /><br />It uses 4 AA batteries wich last for almost 300 pics (at least my cam).<br /><br />Building on the success of the highly popular \"A\" series from Canon, the PowerShot A95 combines a 5.0-megapixel imager and a high-quality 3x optical zoom lens with other features like Canon's DIGIC image processor, a 9-point AiAF auto focus system with a low-light focus assist illuminator, and a \"vari-angle\" 1.8 inch TFT color LCD that can rotate 360?, offering versatility in composing your shots. With its Aperture and Shutter speed priority modes, beginners will be able to explore the different realms of photography. While the more advanced photo enthusiast will appreciate its Manual mode.<br /><br />The Powershot A95 holds the \"top of the line\" position of Canon's \"A\" series. It will make an excellent choice for anyone who wants an easy-to-use camera that captures beautiful pictures and has the advanced features to satisfy the needs of the more experienced user.","I've had this camera for over a year now and use it as my back-up for my digital SLR, a work camera for times I need to record a set-up and as a travel camera for when I'm on the road.<br /><br />I love having it run off of AA batteries because if I'm out on the road and run out of power, I can always stop and buy some replacements. The optics are excellent and the flip-out LCD screen is a blessing for shooting in odd situations. I have used it for thousands of pictures with no problems and consider it absolutely reliable. The controls are fairly simple and intuitive and give enough options to keep things interesting if you want to go beyond the usual \"Auto\" or \"P\" mode. It's size is a bit clunky compared to the new generation of credit card cameras, but they don't have the swing-out LCD or muti-control options. My only serious complaint is I wished it had a RAW format available and a better video option.<br /><br />Other than that, I was so impressed with this camera I sprung for the optional underwater husing so I could take it diving or into camera hostile environments. It is extemely cost effective and will yield outstanding images.","My son was posting incredible photos to his blog, so I asked him what camera he was using.  When he told me the PowerShot A95, I purchased one immediately.  The picture quality is superb!  Clear and crisp; excellent flash that lights up the night and makes the subject stand out.  I haven't been this happy with a camera since I got my brand new Brownie box camera in the 50s.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera.","I bought this camera a few months before i had to go to school in a new city, with the hope of seeing famous people.<br /><br />The camera never really stopped working, but photo's that were made with the Manual mode of the camera all had a blacklight-colored noise around light/dark contrasts.<br /><br />So I returned my camera to the shop which send it back to Canon.<br /><br />After four weeks I had it back and it seemed that everything was fine.<br /><br />After some photo's the noise got even worse and was also visible in photo's made on the Auto mode.<br /><br />It's back to the shop for the second time and I hope that the problem will be fixed, because it makes photo's (excuse me for my language) but-ugly.<br /><br />As you can see my experiences are not the better ones around here.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is \"just\" my camera or if anyone else has this problem, but I know that i'm frustrated about it.","I've had this camera for one year exactly. It's survived weddings, bar mitzvahs, and vacations in countless countries. It is dependable. Let me tell you why else this camera should be considered-<br /><br />(1) A flipable LCD screen. This means that if you're at a bar or another crowded place with the misses you don't have to ask someone to take a picture. You just flip the screen and shot it yourself. For a traveler like myself, this is great. You can bet during New Year's in Trafalga Square that I wasn't about to ask the drunk next to me to take a picture of me and my friend. I know of no other camera that has this. In addition, the screen is protected when you flip it in. Sure, the newer 4 inch screens seem great, but they look kinda fragile.<br /><br />(2) The price is decent, especially now that newer models have come out.<br /><br />(3) 5 megapixels?!?! That means you can print out a 16\"x22\" with no problem in photo-quality. Everyone wants to know the megapixels of your camera, like that's what makes it good. 5 is more than fine, most people only need 3.<br /><br />(4)The panoramic feature IS AMAZING!!! I will upload them to the pictures tonight when I get home from work. I took a 7 photo-long panoramic shoot of London and it is simiply amazing. You can zoom in and see the time on Big Ben!!!! Wow. I am still learning new stuff about my camera all the time.<br /><br />Cons-<br /><br />The size of the camera is a bit chunky, but I don't like having to depend on rechargable NiHm that are $50-70 each. Instead I have a few pairs of recharable AA's that have lasted me over a year and were $10.<br /><br />I am about balancing price with quality: period. I don't care that the newest Canon can take 10 minutes of movie and can act as a webcam. I use my camera for taking pictures and short video clips, that's it. If you want a great camera, buy this one.","I bought this camera a few months before my daughter was born so I could get good pictures of her birth.  This camera has become my best friend.  I take pictures of everything I can.<br /><br />This camera has tons of options and even takes video clips.  It has a lot of options that I have never even used.  Definately read the manual before using!<br /><br />Great digital camera with great quality photos.<br /><br />This camera has been dropped several times and never once gave me trouble.<br /><br />My daughter, husband, and I went on a hike and stopped to take a break.  My camera fell out of my coat pocket without me knowing it.  I did not know until the next day that the camera was not in my pocket.  I went back to the spot we rested and there it was with the screen down on the ground and the lens facing up toward the sky.  I had my screen flipped around and unprotected and when I picked the camera up it was covered in dew drops and leaves.  I wiped it clean and the camera was fine.  After being left out in the weather for 24 hours it never once stopped working.<br /><br />An option I thought was really cool is when you first turn on the camera, you can use any picture you take to be your welcome screen.  It also has different sounds to choose from when you are scrolling through pictures and when you take a picture.  I never knew you could do these sorts of things with a camera.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this camera for anyone.","I love this camera.  One great asset is that the LCD screen flips out.  One big drawback is that it weighs a lot due to haveing 4 AA batteries powering it.  It is also a little bulky to fit in a purse.  I never have a problem with the batteries dying.  Image quality is great.  You can even photo-stitch 2 pictures together or shoot in black and white.  I love it, but have had to send it into Canon twice because it wouldn't turn on, even though the batteries were charged and nothing was wrong with the compact flash card.  They replaced the dc jack and it was fine, but it was an inconvenience.  If you are just a point and shoot photographer, this camera probably has more options than you need.  I bought it because I was interested in using those options like scene selection.  For my purposes, I am probably going to go with a smaller camera for my next purchase, such as the canon elph.","This is a great general camera... small and compact yet with the bells and whistles!","Bought this camera last year before our trip to St. John. This was our first digital camera, and I was a bit intimidated about having one... after seeing all of the buttons and menu items on them in the stores. BUT, when I'd received this beauty, and played with it along with the manual (which is great because there are 2 separate ones - one in English, one in Spanish... so you don't need to hold onto both!), it was a piece of cake! I must admit that I have not taken the time to learn many of the funcitons, as Automatic and Scene settings give me all my family needs!!<br /><br />Although it is perhaps heavier than some cameras due to the fact it takes 4 AA batteries, those batteries last an eternity!! I'd bought 2 sets of extra batteries and the AC Adapter for our trip and only used 1 set for 6 days of shooting and viewing in the Caribbean!! That is phenomenal, in my opinion!! Well worth the little extra weight!!<br /><br />The feel of this camera is also very substantial! It is the best camera we've ever owned!! Digital is so wonderful because you can just keep shooting and shooting... no worries about film ending - and in this case, batteries dying!<br /><br />I know that this model is not available any longer, but the newer versions of this one, I am sure will measure up!","Yup, with two dropped cameras already to my credit, my wife, for very good reasons, get nervous when I buy a yet another camera. But this one has not let me down yet...I have dropped this camera twice already (both times on hard groud) and this baby like the energizer bunny keeps going and going. And what others have said so far about good pictures... that is absolutely true.<br /><br />Anurag Agarwal","I have had three other digital cameras, two Sony's and a Minolta but this Canon 5MP is really great.  I bought two sets of rechargeable batteries so I have some in the charger and the other set in the camera.  I love the big LED screen, which can be opened, turned around and even closed with the screen facing inside to protect it.  It is easy to use and with a 512 memory card, I always have lots of room for my pics.  I just bought my daughter one for Christmas, she had a Sony and the battery doesn't hold a charge.  Also, its just the right size, fits great in my purse and its large enough so I can hold it comfortably.  I love mine and use it a lot more than I used my other cameras.","I have owned this camera for 6 months now. First I narrowed down my choice to Canon based on reviews on digital camera sites (I spent 2 weeks reading reviews until my eyes felt burned out!). I didn't like the image quality of Kodak, and the Fuji cameras had excellent images but not all the features I wanted - like unlimited continuous shooting.<br /><br />After reading tons of reviews I heard the Canon SD models sometimes have an LCD problem and you are also paying a lot more for their slightly more compact size. If you don't care if it is super small, the A series is actually a much better buy!<br /><br />It is 5 MP and since I do graphic design I do use that resolution, although you won't need it unless you do a lot of zooming in and cropping or enlarging photos. The 3x optical zoom is excellent too. It works well in low light conditions or bright outdoors. The colours are very accurate (important to me for graphic design) and the pictures are clear and very \"real\" looking.<br /><br />It really captures motion well, I have taken lots of horse movement shots and the camera has a setting for fast moving objects that can freeze the action without blurring. The camera feels quality and not fragile or cheap.<br /><br />I love this camera it takes gorgeous photos and has options such as continuous shooting (great for action sequences like a horse going over a jump!) It has an optical plus LCD viewvinder, and you can flip the LCD out or rotate it around in case of glare. It has a \"macro\" function which means you can take extreme close-ups. It takes unlimited movies too - which are good quality (not as good as camcorder but one of the best in a camera I have seen). I have not even explored all the options yet, it has a lot of advanced features so I can grow with it.<br /><br />Also it takes regular AA batteries - not a proprietary battery - so if you run out it's easy to get replacements at the store. I use rechargeable NiMH AA's. Some cameras use special batteries that are expensive to replace when they don't hold a charge (like cordless phone and laaptop batteries).<br /><br />I am extremely happy with this camera!!","I've owned Canon film cameras for a long, long time, and loved them.  And the A95 is a good entry-level digital. But even though I read all the Amazon (and other) reviews before purchasing, including the many red-eye warnings, I must say that the problem is bad enough that in spite of only having used it for a few months, I'm already looking forward to my next camera.","If you are looking for a point and shoot, this is the one. I started photography with Sony but was not impressed with some of the features. So I bought this Canon A95 and am very happy with the quality of the pics. I have tried taking some macro shots also which has come out well, but the limit of 5cm focus for macros is kinda not good. Good battery life also.","This camera has been a great transition to the digital world. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.","The camera is quite heavy. I don't like the fact that it comes with regular batteries, it should include the rechargeable ones rigth away. But the features are endless","This is the second digital camera I buy and I am really happy about my purchase.<br /><br />Some may find it a little heavy. Relatively easy to use but requires to read the manual to understand what all the functions are.","If you were interested in this camera, the A95, the new A610, which replaces this model, is out now. It is an incredible camera. I received it yesterday and have not been able to put it down. The price is right and you get a lot for the money. I don't know why it is not available here, I came here first, but it is available from numerous authorized dealers on line now. Check it out, it will not dissapoint.","Great!!  We are having so much fun using the PowerShot A95.","I got this camera for 2 months and I like it. Pictures are excellent and the screen can turn. The only thing is this camera is not light and slim. Overall, I like it","I needed a digital camera for a recent 5,500 mile motorcycle trip through the mid-western U.S. states.  On 7/6/05, I purchased the Canon PowerShot A95, and a 1 GB SanDisk compact flash (CF) memory card for this purpose.  The trip went well and I took lots of photos with the intent of sorting them, and deleting any duplicates once I arrived home and downloaded them to my home PC.  However, that is where the problem occurred.  I can view all the pictures on the camera LCD screen, but the camera and/or the software will not allow me to download/view the pictures on a computer via the USB port.  The camera gets to the point where the download/transfer should start, and then powers off.  Then, I then get an error message that \"there are no images in the camera or camera folder\".  I have tried using the canon supplied software and connecting the camera to two Windows 98 computers and one Windows XP computer - same results.  I talked to the Canon technicians twice while trying this connection on the Windows 98 computers.  One technical guess was that since the camera uses a FAT32 indexing system and Windows 98 uses a FAT16 system, this could be the problem.  Wrong!  Window 98 uses the same FAT32 system that the camera uses.  I tried putting an 128MB SanDisk card in the camera that I had at home, taking 5 test pictures, and they transferred to the PC without a problem.<br /><br />The final results of my hours of trying to get the pictures from the camera to the computer:<br />the Canon technician finally came to the conclusion that there must be an upper limit on the number of pictures that the camera/software can transfer to the computer (undocumented in the owners manual, of course).  Maybe this is why Canon only supplies a 32 MB card with the camera?  According to the technician, I would need to buy an external CF card reader to use in transferring the pictures to the PC from the CF card in the camera.  I just ordered the \"SanDisk ImageMate 12-in-1 USB 2.0 Hi-speed Reader ( SDDR-89-A15 )\", and will try this to retrieve my pictures from the CF card when it arrives.  There was no offer from the Canon technicians that I could return the camera and get it \"fixed\".<br /><br />From what I can currently see on the LCD screen, the camera appears to take good pictures.  However, if you are planning to use the PowerShot A95 (or other Canon camera models?) for pictures during a long vacation, you might consider buying an external card reader along with the camera.  Because of this problem, I gave the camera a 3 star rating.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I have now had the camera for over a year.  The picture quality has, overall, been very good.  One 'bug' that I have noted is that when the camera is set to put a date and time at the bottom right corner of the picture, it works fine in the horizontal mode.  However, the camera does not recognize (for a number of seconds) when it has been turned for a vertical picture.  This results in many of my vertical shots having a date/time stamp along the upper right vertical edge of the photo.  The camera has a sensor (similar to a weighted pendulum) that moves when the camera is tilted 90 degrees for a vertical photo.  Mine apparently sticks and stays in the horizontal position, so the camera does not realize a vertical photo is being taken.  My work-around has been to turn the camera for the vertical shot, then tap it a couple of times with my fingers to get the \"pendulum\" to drop to the correct position for recognizing that a vertical photo is being taken.  The problem with the work-around is that many times, one forgets to do this; and if a passing stranger is taking a picture of you and a group of friends, you always have to tell them to \"tap the camera\" when they tilt it for a vertical photo.  I have not contacted Canon about this, but it should not have been a problem if they had used adequate quality controls/inspections during the production of this camera.","I purchased the Powershot A95 for the same reason many people do; I needed something compact so I'm not lugging my digital SLR everywhere. The A95 has some extensive capabilities you don't normally find in a small digital camera. Although the sensor is a CCD(Charge-Coupled Device) and not the more capable CMOS (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) found on most digital SLRs, the image quality is excellent. It uses the Canon Digic processor also found in their higher quality SLRs. The display screen hinges outward and rotates which protects the surface when stored and allows you to view it from in front or behind the camera. I've read complaints about shutter lag time on the A95 but most all small digital cameras suffer from some degree of shutter lag. If you despise shutter lag you should sacrifice portability and invest in a quality digital SLR. The boot time is reasonable, about 2-3 seconds. The A95 feels solid and is ergonomically well designed. The A95 offers extensive functions, quality image, compact size, and excellent price.","We needed a camera for our first cruise. did some comparison shopping and browsed the Consumer Reports review of digital cameras, prior to purchase and this seemed the best buy. Amazon had the best price. The set up instructions were easy. The 32MB compact flash we knew would be too small for all the pictures we would want to take so I used a 1GB card from my Pocket PC. After that it was just point and shoot for our entire vacation. (We only used the \"auto\" function,but there are many adjustments possible for more experienced photographers.) I can't give this a full 5/5 because it allowed me to delete the first 70 photos without warning that i was about to do something really stupid. Looking back there was a warning but it wasn't sufficiently clear. we still managed to get over 300 good pictures after that.","After spending around six months scouring various digital camera reviews online and through magazines, I finally decided on the Canon Powershot A95 5 Megapixel camera as offering the perfect marriage of power and portability.  My first digital camera, I bought it as a going-away present for myself, since I was spending the summer living and working in Spain and knew that I needed a camera that could keep up with my travels.<br /><br />It was a snap to take out and set up, and intuitive enough that a couple of cursory glances at the Quick Start guide had me well on my way to pointing and shooting. The camera comes with a USB cable, several software programs, a 16 MB Compact Flash card (of course, you'll want to invest in more memory as soon as possible - with the highest-resolution photos, consider a 512 MB or larger card), batteries, and a wrist strap.<br /><br />I would rate the camera as mid-sized. It is not wafer-thin, but neither is it absurdly bulky or heavy. For most of my traveling around Spain, I simply slipped it into its bubble wrap and into a soft fabric bag, where it fit comfortably in my purse.  The design is comfortable to shoot with over long periods, and I found the layout of the buttons to be intuitive.  Less is more: there are few external buttons (shutter, on/off, menu and related buttons), and most controls are carried out through the on-screen menus.  The flip-out LCD screen is one reason I decided on this Canon over others in the PowerShot line; it makes previewing photos a snap, and can be swiveled 180 degrees.<br /><br />The photo quality (I kept it on large superfine) is astonishing: clear, sharp, vibrant photos (check out some of my uploaded photos using the Canon A95) in true-to-life tones with minute detailing. There are various shooting modes, including manual, macro, panoramic (with Stitch Assist software), nighttime, slow shutter, and more, and a movie mode that captures brief (jerky) videos with tinny sound. This isn't a camcorder, so I wasn't surprised that video quality wasn't better, since I bought this primarily for photos.<br /><br />You will also want to invest in a few basic accessories: rechargeable NiCad batteries and a rapid charger, a sturdy case, and a bigger memory card, for starters. Although the included software is capable enough to get the job done, consider upgrading to Adobe Photoshop Elements (around $90), or if you're a pro, Adobe PhotoShop CS 2 (several hundred dollars). An excellent first camera with plenty of power and a reliable name.","I love this camera.  I had a Canon a70 for the last 2 1/2 years.  I never liked the camera.  The pictures were lousy, the shutter was slow and it ate batteries.  With a young baby, I wanted high quality pictures and finally sold the a70 on Craigslist.  Based on reviews I bought the a95 and couldn't be happier.  The prints are beautiful, the clarity is incredible, you just point and shoot.  The portrait setting is great.  This camera is being phased out and is already becoming hard to find.  Get it while you can, you won't regret it.","I'm just a point and shoot photographer but you wouldn't know it based on the pics I've been taking with my new Canon PowerShot A95. Of course I bought a bigger memory card right away and went to a wholesale club to buy a reachargable AA battery pack (no need to spend 2x for the fancy Canon batteries) - but other than that I love my Canon.  It even takes mini movies!  I recently went to Vegas and I was able to take postcard perfect pics of the Strip at night thanks to the special nighttime setting and beautiful underwater pics at the aquariums because of the special undewater setting.  This is all I ever wanted in a digital camera and more for the total bargain price of under $300 (incl. all accessories I mentioned above plus a case!)","The Canon Powershot A95 camera is a great camera for first time users who want to become a bit more advanced in the future.<br /><br />I am at the beginning stage, a newbie if you will, and leave the dial set on \"auto\".  The picture quality is superb. I read up on buying digital cameras and 5mp is a good setting to have if you want to enlarge pictures and have them retain their quality.<br /><br />Anything lower than 3mp won't be good quality pictures.<br /><br />I plan on taking a digital photography class in the future to learn about using other features, but if you look at the instruction booklet you can probably figure them out yourself. I just tend to skim throught the instructions to get the basics down because I am too impatient to use it.<br /><br />I only gave this 4 stars because the storage card that comes with it is too small. I could only fit 20 pictures on the camera. They should have given a larger card for it, but it is easy enought to buy one to expand the storage size, or you could just download the pics more frequently on your computer. There are also lenses and other attachments you can get when you progress from beginner.","I bought this camera just in time for my trip to Ireland and read the manual on the plane. This camera has many features, for instance, I especially like the LCD because it is adjustable and I also like the BW and sepia options.  All the features are pretty easy to use but, I mostly just put it on auto function without any worries.  I turned off my flash in some darker lit areas where I didn't want to wash out the image and keep the warmth of the setting and the camera automatically adjusted and the images turned out nicely.  I was also amazed at the pictures when I got them printed--So very sharp and clear and the color was fantastic!  I am absolutely pleased with the A95 Powershot!","I won't get into the specs of the Canon A95 as you can find that directly on the product page. I frequent photo forums as digital photography is my hobby and I wanted to be sure that anyone who is looking to buy the Canon A95 in the near future knew that the NEW MODELS (Canon A610/A620)are debuting in October 10, 2005. Btw, you can see the specs for those on their product page as Amazon is taking preorders for both the CANON A610 and A620. The Biggest Improvement in my mind will be the incorporation of the Much Faster DIGIC II Processor to reduce the shutter lag between shots.  It will also have VGA(640x480) Video Capability. It will still use 4 \"AA\" Batteries as well! SO, if you are in the market for the Canon A95, you just might want to wait a month or so!","I had a very good professional camera before. But it was so bulky and heavy that I rarely took it along with me.  The little point-and-shoot camera that I had was fully automatic, thus not capable of taking optimal pictures.<br /><br />The A95 camera is the perfect compromise.  It has lots of nice controls/features, and still is of a very reasonable size.  So I end up carrying it with me wherever I go.<br /><br />The camera is very easy to use.  For beginner, you can stick with the auto setting and the special scenes setting.  You could take very good photos with these settings.  But if you want to be more advanterous, then I suggest you read the little menual (it would just take one afternoon).  One reviewer mentioned something about not knowing how to deal with red-eye reduction and strong flash light.  For this camera, you could actually control the amount/intensity of the flash output (in the M Mode) as well turn red-eye reduction on and off by making changes in the menu setting.  I am very sensitive to flash. My eyes would automatically close when the camera flashes in my face.  Now I often use very low output of flash, or don't use flash at all (The great thing about this camera is that you can change the aperture value so that you don't even have to use flash at all when you are in a dark room.  This is great for me to capture photos of dogs and cats).<br /><br />I was able to take beautiful night scenes of the city and university campus (without flash, of course) by adjusting the aperture value.  This is something that it is not possible with automatic cameras.  It is fun to capture the waterfall as you would see in professional photos.<br /><br />I absolutely love the LCD monitor that could be turned over  -- it is so great for self-portrait or group photos on a tripod. Once you have used a monitor that could be turned over, you will never want to go back to one that couldn't.<br /><br />Overall, this is a camera that is excellent for most purposes.","this camera gives great pictures, nice videos and is easy to use- with adaptors available this became my clinical camera and saved me $1100 over current prices for clinical cameras","For those who are not aware, Canon announced a few days ago a replacement for the A95 , the Canon powershot A610 (and A620 that is more expensive) . The new model has 5MP and 4x optical zoom for the same price. It looks like you can pre-order it at Amazon.com...","I searched for 3 months for a new camera. Read CNET reviews, read forums, checked reviews.  Needless to say, it confused me.  I love photography, and I own a web development company, so I wanted something that would produce nice images.<br /><br />Well this nice little camera did so much more than I expected!  As of yet, several months later, I still don't understand all of the settings - however, just using the basic auto features, I've taken  great images of sunsets, cloudy days and more.  Shortly after I bought the camera, I went on a trip to a place I'd never been, so I took waaay too many photos.  One of the best things was the video setting.  I just turned it to the video camera picture and hit the start button.  When I got home, I had hours of video which I was able to add effects to and music, thus making my own video!  All without reading the book and using the included software!! Wow!<br /><br />The other great thing that I love about the camera is the disc space.  I had a 512M card and I could not fill it each day of vacation, including tons of video!<br /><br />What sold me on this camera and made me buy it, was some of the photos I saw people take with it - nighttime skylines of San Francisco with no enhancements, just the offered settings - that was fabulous.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a fantastic camera with a nice little price, this is the one!  The other models that are popular only seem to be offering a higher price and a much tinier case. If you're used to regular cameras, this is plenty small enough - easy to handle, easy to see screen (that flips upside down so you can take pics of yourself) - and no accidentally hitting the wrong button!  Great!","This is a good value for a family camera. We really like being able to take short videos and high res stills with one camera. The batteries last for weeks at the rate we use them. We recommend buying NiMH batteries and a good charger to save money on batteries.","This is my first digital camera and I think it is the greatest.","This camera is awesome!  It's 5 megapixels which makes every shot crisp and clear!  And the swivel display makes taking portaits for yourself, or pictures with friends a lot easier!  You don't get any more of those off-center pictures with someone's head cut out!  The only downfall to this camera is that it's a little bit big and clunking, but it's awesome features, and specs make up for it!","I absolutely love this camera.  I am a novice and it is so simple to use.  It makes crystal clear pictures and you can do fun things with it.  The price was just right.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.","I am totally pleased with the camera. I'm still learning all the features since this is my first digital camera I didn't realize how much you can do with them. Also,I ordered from Amazon.com and saved $30 by using Super Saver Shipping and of course their already low price. Highly recommend this camera.","This was a birthday gift for my mother.  She couldn't be happier!  It takes awesome pictures!!  The quality is impeccable.","Very easy to master basic functions.  Excellent image quality.  Many more features than can be quickly utilized.","Bought this camera to replace a malfunctioning Canon A70.  I am pleased how Canon has designed this camera to be a point and shoot or a creative instrument of photography.  I got this camera to compliment my Digital Rebel.  I use it for the times when I just want a camera in my back pocket to grab a quick shot of something.  I hope it last longer than the camera it's replacing.","I really like this camera... it's easy to use and takes great pictures... a bit bulky, but it's worth the price... the tiny ones of equal quality cost a lot more...","I love this cam very much. My dad gifted me on my birthday and we as a family using it at all occasions.","I used Amazon for the first time and am very pleased with my purchase. I was amazed by the fact it was at my door within a couple of days even though I chose the basic shipping (3 to 5 business days.) As far as the camera, I am extremely pleased. It takes GREAT pictures. I used Amazon's personal reviews to make my choice. I was looking at another choice, but upon reading the reviews, I changed my selection. While the other camera was rated extremely high on quality of pictures, I found one user who had a problem because he had accidentally dropped his camera from not too far a highth and it broke a door off and the camera stopped working. The manufacturer wanted the price of a new camera to fix it. A user of the Canon A95 wrote that he had dropped his and it continued to work (although he didn't recommend trying this yourself.) Well, I guess I had to find out myself. I took it on my first trip ever to Hawaii. On the FIRST day, I accidentally dropped it from a hight of probably 4 feet right onto the black, sharp, hard Lava rock. I freaked. I just knew it was toast. When I examined it, I found a little ding on the memory card door and the card had popped out a little. I pushed the card back in, closed the door (it still opened and closed properly), and lo and behold, the camera still worked perfectly! I highly recommend this camera for GREAT quality pictures and it is most definately a must for the klutzes of the world like me.","To those folks who've complained that the Canon A95 has a long time lag between pushing the button and capturing the image:  push the button half-way down while aiming at your subject and the camera will set the exposure and the focus; keep on holding the button in that position until the perfect moment arrives to snap the picture; then push it down the rest of the way and the picture will be taken nearly instantaneously.<br /><br />By the way, the dial on top of the camera that lets you choose among various modes tends to rotate pretty easily if a finger happens to rub against it.  So I've made a habit of checking the dial frequently to be sure it's in the mode I intended (which for me is usually \"AUTO\" mode).<br /><br />I've had the camera for 7 or 8 months now, have taken thousands of pictures, and have been delighted with it.<br /><br />Another aside: I don't use the Canon software (although I used Canon software with an earlier Canon camera).  To transfer the pictures to my computer, I use a \"card reader\" (available for $10 to $20) that plugs into a USB port; when I insert the CF card into the reader, the card looks like a disk drive to the computer, so I just copy and paste the files to where I want them.  (For editing photos, I use Adobe Photoshop Elements on one computer, and Irfanview (which is free) on all of my computers.)","Pros:<br /><br />1)The zoom feature AFTER you take the picture: The pic maintain its quality even after zooming super close up<br /><br />2) The flippy LCD monitor that lets you see what you're doing when you take a picture of yourself and a friend in front of the Eifle Tower or whatever.<br /><br />3) Takes really good pictures of flowers close up. My Dad is a landscaper and he uses this camera exclusively for flowers.<br /><br />4) The software works well for my purposes. Let's you edit, adjust color, redeye etc, and make slide shows! Wow!<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1) I have not had a good experience with the red eye preventer thing. When I take pics inside they often have redeyes, but the software takes care of this.<br /><br />2) The flash is so bright I can't take a proper picture of my cat. His eyes are always half closed. Not good for people who like to take pictures of their cats indoors.<br /><br />3) It's kind of bulky.","This is a great camera.  The batteries seem to last forever compared to my rechargable Nikon 4300.  The controls and settings are very intuitive, and the results are fantastic.  I'd recommend this camera to anyone looking for a sturdy, reliable digital camera.","To be honest, I have not used THIS camera yet.. but I did use a similar model, the A60. As another reviewer warned, there is a weakness in the design causing many Canon A## users to experience an issue with the zoom control. (The error code is 'E18'. a.k.a the 'E18 Issue'.) Here is a link to describe the issue and several possible resolutions, including repair via Canon.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />(or google \"E18\" and \"Canon\")<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed my now-dead Canon very much and am still considering getting the A95.. of course, with extended warranty.","For those familiar with the PowerShot series, this is one of the best in the line that I've ever used.<br /><br />The cleverly designed ergonomic grip (where the batteries are actually located) fits much better than previous models.  Canon simplified their menus and buttons, which is great for both veterans of this line and complete beginners.  The LCD screen moves and rotates rather slowly, but once it's locked it's secure.<br /><br />Problems you sometimes hear about the photo quality (flash washes out picture, blurry images, etc.) may come from the AUTO setting.  Users really need to utilize the other settings to get that shot to look just right.<br /><br />My only gripe is that they provide only 32MB for their Compact Flash card.  Fortunately, larger sized ones are available at more reasonable prices than a few years ago.<br /><br />A great camera overall for your average point and shoot photographer.  Professional photographers should know by now to move on to other Canon lines.","I had been contemplating on buying a digital camera for a few days, wanting to get a good idea of which camera was for me. I am not a digital camera/photography expert, but I still know quite alot about cameras. Even if this camera is not for you, I would still only go with a Canon camera - nothing less except maybe a Konica Minolta. It cost me $299.99 at Fry's Electronics and everywhere I've looked, it's that same price.<br /><br />This is a very comfortable camera to be held in the hand, even if it is a bit thick. Having immediate family members that didn't like flat-faced cameras such as the Canon Elphs, I considered getting a Canon A series. I previously owned an A70 and now I have upgraded to an A90. I am simply ecstatic about this camera - definitely worth it! The picture quality is amazing for the price! With 3x Optical and 4x Digital zoom, you can be sure to get the photos you need. Sporting a nice 5 megapixels, this is a great camera for simple family vacations to really shooting breathtaking scenes like waterfalls or canyons, etc., that demand quality when you can't afford to have bad pictures! Canon A series has always had a good number of shooting modes, this model having 14! It pays to read the manual so that you can maximize the most of this little wonder. Practically everything is customizable and easy to change - you can stitch photos together with ease to form panoramic shots, choose from 8 different scene modes like foliage, snow, beach, and so forth, and much more.<br /><br />One thing I like about this camera alot is that it is not hard on your budget. This is not like those other money-saving cameras that may give you a few good features at the cost of other critical features. You get everything you pay for plus some with the Canon A95. Also, it uses CF (Compact Flash) memory cards - cheap, high speed, and lots of space for all the photos you need to take. Included is a 32 MB memory card with the camera, but you should probably upgrade to at least 128 MB ($14.99), or even better, 256 MB ($29.99). This may seem alot for extra space, but compared to Sony Memory Sticks (only memory format that Sony uses) which take a heaping bite out of your wallet, you won't regret buying a bigger memory card.<br /><br />The LCD screen is revolutionary on the A95. Measuring in at a comparitively small 1.5 inches, it nevertheless delivers crystal clear photo viewing. If you prefer bigger LCDs, sorry, but in this camera's price range, generally alot of small LCD cameras are the most popular either way as they tend to have the best quality (Konica Minolta G500 and G600!) This LCD flips out of the  case like a video camera recorder and then you can flip it around and set it back in so that the screen faces you! That way, when the screen is in its original position, it can't be scratched! A very valuable feature in the camera field. The software included is relatively easy to use - install the CD and plug the camera into your USB. You can even manage photo transfer on the camera itself instead of using your computer's keyboard. The USB is fast and the cord is long, so if you have USB ports on the back of your computer, don't worry - the cord is long enough for you to safely extend the camera onto your desk.<br /><br />The only possible \"con\" I could find in this doesn't have to do with picture quality or lack of features; It's the fact that this camera (as well as all of the A series) takes 4 AA batteries. The camera battery life is fine and all, but be prepared to take a charger and maybe 2 sets of 4 Rechargable NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydroxide) batteries when you take this camera with you on vacations. The batteries are about $10.99-12.99 for a 4 pack (I use Energizer, my camera gets alot of power out of them). Included with the camera is 4 cheap Panasonic alkaline batteries, which generally run out fast.<br /><br />Overall, however, I would highly recommend this versatile, virtually perfect camera. From total beginners to cameras to photography veterans, this camera will suit anyone.","This Camera is very awesome. It takes pictures impeccably and is just like State-of-the-art stuff. The only regret I have of buying it is that it didn't ship ontime for me to take it to England (although Amazon promised to ship it earlier). Now I'm back, I can't get my hands off it. I love the zoom feature, and also the Video Camera feature.It's pretty neat and I'll recommend it for any Amazon buyer needing a Digital Camera.","I owned a Canon Powershot A40 for a few years and was always happy with the resulting pictures.  The A95 is almost the same camera, but has 5 mega pixels instead of 2.1.  There are some differences in the features, i.e., the A95 has more features, and an improved movie function.  My use of the camera is basically regular pictures of the family, holidays, etc.  The panorama feature is one that I've used as well.  There is software with the A95 that allows a user to edit their pictures.  One thing that the A95 does allow is for better enlargements.  The 5 mega pixels will give decent resolution for 8 x 10 prints.  The A95, like the A40 allows you to use regular AA batteries and also the compact flash card (which I already had).  The A95 is the same size as the A40.  The price of the A95 is also attractive.","Here are my thoughts, point-by-point:<br /><br />- 5.0 megapixels of Canon quality. Canon's reputation for high-quality images is well-deserved. You may find less expensive 5.0 megapixel cameras out there, but if you get a Canon, you'll know where the extra money went. And you won't regret spending a penny of it.<br /><br />- Ease of use. If you're a complete newbie, you can just set the camera in Auto and snap away. But if you're looking for a little more control, it's at your fingertips, and it won't take long for you to learn the menu system. If you've used other Canon digital cameras, you'll feel right at home. (But of course, if you want to know the A95's functions inside and out, there's no substitute for reading the well-written manual.)<br /><br />- Lots of shooting options. There are some 14 different shooting modes available to cover just about every conceivable situation. Personally I use only two or three, but it's nice knowing they're there.<br /><br />- A great lens. Canon has long been known for quality lenses, and the one in the A95 is no exception. It features 3x optical zoom and a maximum aperture of f/2.8--shoot near and far, and in a wide range of lighting conditions. (Quick tip: to shoot indoors or in low light without using the flash or a tripod, change the ISO setting.)<br /><br />- Flexible (but somewhat slow) autofocus. The autofocus system automatically selects between nine points, making it easy to capture off-center subjects with ease. Unfortunately, it can be tricky getting subjects in motion, especially in low-light situations. This takes practice and a bit of trial-and-error to overcome. Hopefully Canon will address this shortcoming in the future.<br /><br />- \"Vari-Angle\" LCD. This is the feature that won me over. It can be manipulated very much like many camcorder LCDs, flipped out from the camera body and turned to face a wide range of angles. With the screen turned to face the same direction as the lens, you can even use the A95 as a mirror! And when the camera is not in use, the screen can be folded into the camera body, protecting it from damage. The screen measures 1.8\" diagonally and is clear and crisp, even in harsh sunlight.<br /><br />- Size and weight. The A95 is a lot of camera in a little package--at least compared to a full-featured digital SLR. It's compact, but not pocket-sized (unless you have rather large pockets). If you don't already have a gear bag or a purse, I recommend getting a case with a shoulder strap if you plan on carrying it around a lot. Also, the A95's got a decent amount of heft to it. Personally I don't mind the weight; coming from the professional world, I like the feeling of something solid in my hand.<br /><br />- Batteries and battery life. One reason the camera weighs a bit is because it uses four AA batteries. Opinions vary on this, but I consider this a positive. If my batteries die, it's easy to drop in a new set and get going again. The A95 will use either conventional alkaline batteries or NiMH rechargeables; I recommend picking up a set or two of the latter. They're available cheap from a wide variety of places (something I can't say about the proprietary rechargeables found in most other digital cameras, other Canon models included).<br /><br />My only complaint in this department is that there's no visible battery life indicator on the LCD; you're only told when a battery set is on its last legs. I wouldn't worry too much about this. You can get hundreds of shots out of a single set of alkaline AAs and can get even more out of a set of rechargeables, and you can extend battery life further by limiting your use of the flash and LCD. But keep a spare set handy, just in case.<br /><br />- Uses CompactFlash memory. The A95 uses CompactFlash Type I, which is compatible with Canon and Nikon's digital SLRs. If you already have a digital SLR, you'll be able to share memory cards (as long as they're Type I, not the thicker Type II). If you're a pro looking for a camera for casual use, this is something to think about.<br /><br />You'll definitely want to pick up a high-capacity card; you'll only get about 10 pictures, if that, out of the included 32 MB card. I recommend at least a 512 MB card--the bigger the better. I also recommend getting a USB CompactFlash card reader for your computer. Connecting the camera to your computer directly drains battery life (unless you have an AC adapter, not included with the camera). Use that battery life to shoot more pictures!<br /><br />- Attention to detail. Canon's A series may be their \"value\" line, but there's nothing cheap about the feel of this camera. Every button gives solid tactile feedback. The shutter has a well-defined distinction between half-down (to focus) and full-down (to shoot). And thanks to the built-in orientation sensor, photos shot vertically are oriented properly in playback mode. Little touches like these make all the difference.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />There are cameras that are smaller, lighter, better-looking, less expensive, and with more features. If you want smaller, lighter, or better-looking, try the Canon S or SD series. If you want something less expensive, try the other A series models like the A510. If you want more features, move on up to an SLR like the Digital Rebel. But it's hard to find a camera that can balance all of these considerations as well as the A95. It's a rare gem of a camera that has something for everyone--ease of use for a beginner, more features and control for an amateur or professional. And given the rich feature set and Canon's renowned picture quality, it's an incredible value.","I'm a \"push here dummy\" camera person, although it's a running joke in my family just how many pictures I take. This camera takes lovely pictures even for me.  I particularly appreciate the LCD display.  When not in use, it is folded against the back of the camera with the display facing in and thus protected. When the camera is on, you can twist it to be visible from the front of the camera, pull it out to the side, push it flat against the back of the camera, or leave it in place and save some battery.<br /><br />I bought this without having actually handled it; it is somewhat bigger than most digital cameras although not cumbersome.  My biggest complaint, and something that would have made me reconsider buying it, is just how long the lag actually is between pushing the button and taking the picture.  I read about it, but it just didn't seem like such a big deal.  And it probably isn't, if you are shooting landscapes and posed pictures, or if you are really good at predicting what is going to happen in 3 seconds.  However, if you generally photograph younger kids or pets, try this one out in person before you buy, and decide if you can work around that delay.  The pictures are wonderful, but they may not be the ones you were wanting to get.","We love this camera, and we haven't even begun to explore the manual settings yet.  Got it 2 days before our holiday, and with very little experimenting were taking absolutely beautiful pictures.  The sunset pictures really amazed me, point & click and end up with beautiful colors & great definition.  Loads of fun!","At mid-$200's this is an excellent value.  I've had the camera for about a week. I'm a professional photographer and own several professional digital Fuji bodies. I needed a good point and shoot to carry with me for casual family shooting.  I am surprised and pleased with the quality of the images, especially at 50 ISO and fine settings.  I only need about a 1 to 1.5 mb file size to get an excellent 5x7, which is really the largest size I would ever need for this application.  Plenty of features, including a full Manual setting if you need it.<br /><br />The only negative so far is that it does not focus very well in moderate to low light, especially at the higher focal lengths (and accompanying higher F stop)but I guess that's understandable for a slower lense.  To compensate, in lower light I tend to shoot at the widest zoom settings.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely pleased with the results for a point and shoot.","This is really a cool product. It has lot of good features that makes this product handy to use and preferred over others.<br /><br />To state a few features:<br /><br /> 1) Optical zoom of 3x sufficient for a good photgraphy<br /><br /> 2) Supports big sized snaps with its 5MP resolution<br /><br /> 3) Easy to handle the various modes of the cam<br /><br /> 4) Good battery backup<br /><br /> 5) You can add a memory chip to get more snaps","I have tried several digital cameras, but this one really impresses me. The quality of the pictures is the best one comparing with similar cameras; besides, it offers several functions that make the beginner to get professional style pictures. It comes with everything needed to start taking pictures, so no additional items are immediately required.","For months prior to purchasing my Canon Powershot A95, I researched digital cameras and found that, across the board, the A95 was highly-rated. Finally, on my birthday, I ordered it -- and anxiously awaited its arrival.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was elated -- the camera itself is gorgeous, packed with features and easy to use right out of the box. However, within minutes I noticed a small blue square visible on the LCD screen. It was a \"hot pixel,\" which -- as I understand it -- is a pixel that's receiving too much information (as opposed to a \"dead pixel\" which is a pixel that's not receiving any). Disappointed, and wanting to start off with a camera in mint condition, I called Canon and was told that they would only repair or replace a camera if there were between four and six hot pixels visible. So, as a second resort, I signed onto Amazon and requested a replacement; UPS picked my camera up the next day and two days after that, my second A95 was delivered.<br /><br />Thrilled, I opened the package and tried out the replacement. All was well until, a few hours later, I noticed a one white pixel and one red pixel on the LCD screen. Hoping that perhaps the pixels were only visible on the screen and not on the actual photos, I transferred the test images to my computer (via a card-reader) and found, to my chagrin, that the red pixel was present on the images themselves. Frustrated, I contacted Amazon again and was this time told that they couldn't send out a second replacement but would instead issue a full refund, along with a ten dollar credit to use towards a future Amazon purchase.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm quite discouraged and am now wondering if there is something wrong with the latest batch of A95s which was not present until now. Though I'm s till convinced, thanks to so much positive feedback, that this is quality item, I'm wary of purchasing another -- at least without field testing it at the store of purchase first.<br /><br />**Update**<br /><br />I did go ahead and purchase this camera again -- this time from a brick-and-mortar store. And my A95 and I had many happy times together. I've since graduated to Canon Rebel XTi (dslr), but my A95 remains part of my arsenal.","When my husband told me he wanted to buy me a new digital camera to replace my three year old camera, I told him heck no! I knew how to use my faithful Canon A70 inside and out, and I was not looking forward to the learning process for using a new camera.<br /><br />I knew I'd love the clarity that additional megapixels would give, as well as the numerous enhancements Canon adds to their products as you go up the product line. Yet my answer was no to a new camera.<br /><br />Fortunately for me (unfortunately for my spouse), I had a few moments recently, and I was able to download a PDF file of the manual for the Canon PowerShot A95. I discovered I could easily transfer the skills I learned by using my Canon A70 to this new camera as well as benefit from the many added perks. I went to a brick and mortar store to see the camera and hold it and discovered, with my long fingers, the camera fit as confortably as my A70. By the way, the camera feels extremely light and off balance out of the box (and in the store), but add the four AA batteries and the camera is weighted perfectly.<br /><br />So I said yes to the Canon PowerShot A95, and I LOVE IT!<br /><br />I had to get another lens converter for my new digital camera, and the A70 telephoto lense does not fit on the A95, but the wide angle lens does. The A95 also fits in my old camera case, and I carry it with me everywhere. The A95 turns on faster, and recovers from a shot quicker than my old camera. The LCD screen view is crisper and can be used in daylight easier (it's not perfect, but it's better than the A70).<br /><br />Canon has made a computer software upgrade with added features, yet navigating through it wasn't difficult (since it was very similar to my old camera's computer software). The mini-movie feature works great indoors and the subject doesn't have to yell to be picked up by the camera's built in mike. It's good outdoors but not for speeches. With playback, the camera speaker is sufficient. The camera is even capable of playing a mini movie or showing the pictures on its card via a television once you connect the camera to your TV (cord included).<br /><br />Canon has done it for me again, and I highly recommend this camera to anymore who wants a 5MP camera-size device that is easy to use, easy to program, fits comfortably in an adult's hand and provides stunning results.<br /><br />If you're looking for one of those slim cameras, pass this one by. But if you want semi-professional-like camera to take majestic sunrises/sunsets, the first bloom of spring, and your grandmother celebrating her 100th birthday with bright, accurate and clear coloring, this is the camera for you!","Good product.  It takes good pictures.  Lots of settings, like sepia and black&white.<br /><br />Processes pictures fairly fast.  Although i've seen faster.<br /><br />Prepare to spend the money on rechargeable batteries, and a charger, or you'll spend it all in batteries, and still not have a charger.<br /><br />Overall, i really like the camera.","This camera is almost perfect!!!<br /><br />Lots of features are built right into the camera.  In addition, you can buy lens and filters or even an underwater case.  This camera can eventually do just about anything you can think of.<br /><br />The 5 megapixels are great for 8 x 10 prints or even 13x19!!!!<br /><br />Would like a battery gauge that gave more warning of dead batteries and longer battery life.","This camera is great.  This camera has a lot of manual options to help you develop your photography skills.  Definatley get a case and some rechargeable batteries for it.  The camera is a little thick, but that works out well for me since I have big hands.  As with all Digital cameras of this price range, the A95 isn't the best in low light conditions without a tripod.  I highly recommend that you buy this camera.","Would be nice if the screeen was bigger and the camera was smaller","I purchased the camera thru \"Amazon affiliate\" and recieved the camera about a week after I ordered it. Was in perfect condition and I have used the camera for about 2 weeks now.<br /><br />It's a great digital camera for the price and picture quality. It came with it's uploading software and I use the camera along with my Mac G4 and Photoshop 7- it's compatiable and I haven't had any problems so far. Bought it along with (2) 512 MB Sundisk flash cards and on the highest quality setting the cards can store about 200 pictures on each. People say the 32 MB card is worthless but for me it's a decent back up card. On a lower setting it can produce about 30 pictures but atleast I have some peace of mind I wouldn't go home empty handed.<br /><br />I even dropped the camera two days ago on asphalt (!) and it still working fine. Not on pupose of course!- my camera bag was open and after trying to run across a street, it flew out and my heart sank when I  heard the plactic hit the street.  Other than some chipped paint and some nasty stratches on the out lens ring and a gash on the focus button/wheel it works fine as of this writing. It seems OK and I'm grateful for my luck. Hopefully all of the Canon Powershot Digital camera are made as tough as this one. Satisfied.<br /><br />My only complaint is plastic doors that enclose both the batteries and CF cards is made of plastic and feels rather cheap. I'm worried more about them becoming weak and brittle as the camera ages. But hopefully it's built to last.<br /><br />Very pleased so far- just wish I hadn't dropped it! Arrgh!","I was looking for a camera with enough MPs that can provide me the quality photographs with high resolution. I went through various stores and finally, I purchased this.<br /><br />There were several reason behind my decision but the best of all features are:<br /><br /> - 5.0 Megapixel CCD sensor enables the A95 to provide superb image quality, suitable for high quality photo prints up to A3 size.<br /><br /> - 32 MB CompactFlash memory card and you can plug more to it.<br /><br /> - Easy to download photgraphs<br /><br /> - Easy to configure<br /><br /> - High quality lens<br /><br />All in all, this is really useful and worth.","This is my first digital camera. In the early '70's I started with a fully manual Pentax K1000 35mm camera. Upon deciding to move up to a digital camera, I researched many brands, styles and models looking for just the camera to fit my wants, needs and pocketbook.<br /><br />I wanted something I could have total creative control over, and yet my husband would be able to pick it up and take great pic's automatically. I spoke to many friends and colleagues and got the skinny on most every well known brand of camera. Over and over, the Canon A series got thumbs up.<br /><br />I put the Canon A95 on my Amazon.com wish list and got it as a Christmas 2004 gift. I have used it almost daily since.<br /><br />One of the many settings is for snow and here in New England we had several heavy snowfalls last winter. I have some beautiful snowstorm pictures taken at night. The detail is fabulous right down to the capture of single snowflakes. The clarity in the depth of these photos is such that you feel like you could walk right into the storm... you can feel the snow.<br /><br />The one thing I am disappointed with is the nice sized, variable position view screen does not have a backlight. That can be a major drawback to someone who takes a lot of pictures in the pitch black. I don't, but there have been occasions where I tried to aim and shoot, praying I'd get the shot. Sometimes I did, others I didn't. What I mean is I could not see WHAT I was capturing, but whatever I did get was fine.<br /><br />I have not purchased any other lenses for this camera (it has the versatility to change lenses just like a 35mm) nor have I seen any advertising for these lenses and other peripherals... I would like to.<br /><br />Battery life is pretty good, you get ample warning when the batteries are low. I forgot extra batteries for my niece's wedding and despite low battery warnings I was able to get all the pic's I wanted. I set mine to turn off according to my needs and this saves battery life. I've used regular AA batteries until today when I bought the rechargeables.<br /><br />Bottom line... Positives: great camera - loaded with features and settings, excellent pictures and total creative control.<br /><br />Negatives: No backlight, hard to find add ons.","The Canon Powershot A95 is the best camera out there for the average consumer. It prints the most beautiful and clear photos. I have found it to be the fastest shot with the clearest pictures. It has almost all the settings of a professional camera and has a really nice screen to view your pictures on. I would highly recommend this camera.","I've had this camera for almost a year now. I've taken over 3000 pics with it and am very very happy with the results. I got it when it was $100 more than it streets for now, and still think it's a great deal.<br /><br />LOWDOWN: If you're like me and would rather concentrate on enjoying the moment, yet be able to take pretty darn good shots when you want to without lugging all that equipment around for an SLR/DSLR, then this is the cam for you. The A95 has that important balance between pocketability, fit-to-hand, weight, and great optics and sensor.<br /><br />Plainly put, i find that I have the cam with me when the opportunity presents itself, whether it's a great moment or planned shot. So I take the picture, instead of wishing i had lugged all the equip around. I just do some exposure bracketing just in case, and I'm good to go. The controls are easy, and for anyone going from 35mm SLR to this, the controls are there for you to make sure that you take a good shot. Aperture priority, shutter priority, ASA film settings, etc..<br /><br />For the lazy snapshooters inside of all of us, there are enough quick settings to use that you can pretty much be guaranteed a good photo as long as you use a little intelligence.<br /><br />But what about the pictures? Folks compliment me all the time on my shots, and ask about my SLR. There are about 30 photos posted on my office wall (use a real silver halide service and skip the crappy home printers). These are anything from 5 x 7 to framed 22\" x 30\" posters. They all look pretty damn good because of 5MP plsu smart ASICs that Canon has (plus the ability to edit them easily when needed with Photoshop Elements.)<br /><br />I don't bother with the share functions, just pop the compact flash in my card reader and Elements just sucks it right in - simple.<br /><br />Great sensor that can simulate up to 800ASA film (maybe faster), i think, so under most circumstances, with subjects that are not moving much, it works great. And the Scene settings work well. You should see the great Fireworks shots i got this weekend. BTW - maybe I'm not discriminating enough, but i haven't conticed a big 'purple fringing' problem.<br /><br />This is my third DSC - had a Fuji 900 - great cam, takes better pics than my Olympus, but too big to slip into pocket; Olympus c70(?) camedia - nice lens, but needs image stabilization to take advantage of the ling lens. Not great images - lots of noise at low light settings.<br /><br />This review would be five stars if not for the programming of the flash (need a slower, softer flash, or a hot shoe that i can control). The flash, when used in less than 8' from the subject, has a tendancy to blow out the details. So I shoot with natural light whenever I can. And of course, i would love if the A95 had the responsiveness and no shutter lag like a DSLR - but for hundreds less, it's quick enough.<br /><br />The A95 will probably remain my main camera for some time. I may even skip plans for getting a DSLR, instead I'm ordering the A95 accessory lenses, so i may never need a DSLR....<br /><br />p.s. Make sure to get a couple or three of 512MB cards - they're cheap enough now, and if you use the top resolution setting, you'll find that a card fills up on a weekend trip.","This camera is the perfect combination of features, price, and size. It is suitable for a person who just wants to \"point-and-click\" to take pictures but at the same times also allows a photo enthusiast to customize the shooting process to his or hers heart's content. There are so many options in this camera to experiment with that you'll definitely be able to take better pictures.<br /><br />At around $250, this camera beats the pants off of all other cameras at this price point. Believe me, you are not going to find something equivalent at this price.<br /><br />If you want a small, high quality camera at a great price, buy this camera. You won't regret it.","One word: perfect for this price. nobody can beat canon digital cameras. Sony sucks!","I purchased this camera a few weeks ago and I love it. This is my first digital and it is very easy to use and the pictures come out beautifully. Definitely a nice camera for the inexperienced photographer.","I take this camera almost everywhere I go to take home memories. It comes out very good. Like real people are inside the picture. I also love putting it on the computer.","I've had this camera for about eight months now  and I have not faced many problems with it. It has very good features that are also easy to learn and understand. The only thing I was not quite satisfied was the night mode shooting. The pictures appear bluury and shaky and it is always better if you reduce your ISO speed and if possible keep the camera on a tripod or on any fixed surface as the shutter speed is slow in this mode.<br /><br />Apart from that, I have never had any problems with the camera. All my pictures have come out well: clear and crisp. If you read the manual well; understand its varied functions and know how to operate it, this is a really nice camera and a good investment.<br /><br />Have fun with your camera.","Bottom line....this is the camera for you! I sold my old cannon and upgraded to this camera. Its battery life was overwhelmingly better than the previous camera I owned, which was a major perk. The picture quality is outstanding, clean and clear. Thecamera for all its many functions is actually very easy to use. I cannot begin to tell you how great of a value this digital is. You will be very happy that you will have a strong and reliable camera for a long time!","I did tons of research looking for the best digital camera, and as it was to be my first camera of this type, I wanted the most \"bang for my buck\" and something I could grow into as well as use right away. This was the best choice I could have made! I received the camera on Friday evening, by Saturday evening I was taking great, clear pictures. And by Monday was taking pictures like a professional.<br /><br /> I love how I have so much control over the settings, or can just let the camera do it. My favrite favorite use of the camera has been the macro setting, and the flowers shots I have been able to take are incredible!!<br /><br /> I had been sceptical about the folding view screen, but as was predicted in other reviews, it is a great feature.<br /><br /> One last note, a number of reviews mention a \"flimsy battery door, and Flash Card door\". I have found neither one to be as bad as was said, and feel it should hold up to much wear.<br /><br /> I would without hesitation recommend this camera to everyone, it seems to do everything that was said about it and more!","If you want to have everyone ooh and ahh over how \"cute\" and tiny your little silver camera is -- then this is not the camera for you.  Stick to the Elph.  But you will pay more for that cuteness and size.  This camera strikes a balance between convenience, picture quality, size and features that is unmatched in this price range.<br /><br />Like all digital cameras it won't make gorgeous pictures with bad lighting.  Take that as a fact of life.  Unless you carry 10 1k lights around with you - you're going to get some flat, fuzzy and perhaps slightly unfocused pictures in low light settings.  If you want great night shots go for the Prosumer type Canons and buy a tripod so you can use a wide aperture and long shutter speed.<br /><br />In the point and shoot realm you will have to just take a bunch of pictures and know that you will need a good program to really make them shine.  I recommend Photoshop Elements.  You won't find a better consumer level program.<br /><br />This camera takes normal AA batteries so it is a bit heavier than those that recharge the tiny battery in the camera.  With my Energizer rechargeables I never once ran out of charge in a day.  That is with taking hundreds of pictures and turning the camera on and off.  That is very good power management!<br /><br />This camera has a flip out screen for a viewfinder.  It is not the biggest screen you will find on a camera and that is one of the negatives -- but you couldn't have a flip out with a 2 or 2.5 inch screen.  Don't underestimate the usefullness of that flipout!  I can't tell you how many times I was able to get a shot because I was able to orient that every which way.  It is more than just flipping it out -- you can rotate it back and forth too.  And when you flip it around you can put it back in the camera just like all the others with the screen on the back -- plus the image flips to compensate!<br /><br />Image Quality - this is where this camera truly shines.  Colors are vibrant.  Details are crisp.  As long as you have enough light.  Under cloudy conditions or night time then you won't get as good of shots but most can be corrected after the fact if you know how.<br /><br />I have a Sony camera which cost me over $1000 and this camera beats it for quality of photos.  I was also watching a guy in front of me at a concert taking pics with his brand new sleek flat Sony and every picture was blurry.  Mine weren't exactly pro quality but they were better.  Again -- low light is tough for a little point and shoot.<br /><br />You can fit this camera in your pocket if you have big pockets that are loose.  Tight jeans -- forget it.  But you won't scratch this screen like I've heard Elph owners complain about.  I suggest going to a store and trying to put it in your pocket.<br /><br />Bottom line - If you want a great quality camera and don't mind it not being the latest and thinnest camera out there you can't go wrong with this.  To get the same image quality you would have to buy other cameras for several hundred more.  Amazon has a really great price for it too.","After weeks of research on the web (here at amazon and at other places) reading reviews, comparisons, etc. I came to the conclusion that this is the best camera on the market for the price.<br /><br />I bought mine here through amazon about 10 days before I was to leave for a long road trip from Oregon to Hollywood through many great stops such as the Redwood Forest, Yosemite National Park, Disneyland, and other great sites. Thus I was very anxious for my camera to arrive.<br /><br />One week after ordering, I checked to see how far along the way it had come - I was hoping (and expecting) to get it any day. To my disappointment, it had only been shipped the day before (5 days after I placed the order) and I was certain it wouldn't arrive on time for my trip.<br /><br />To my great surprise and relief, the camera was delivered by UPS only a few minutes before I was to leave. (I was packing up the car and seriously on my way out the door when he came.)<br /><br />The point of my long story is that I had no time to read the instructions before leaving, so I had to rely 100% on the camera being self-explanitory and very easy-to-follow for people like me who had frankly never used a digital camera before.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that it was VERY easy to learn, and I was able to get by on my 3,000 mile trip using only the auto functions.<br /><br />Take a look at my pictures (uploaded to the images section for this camera) to see the results.<br /><br />The only features I couldn't find (without looking it up in the manual) were: 1) the self-timer. 2) speed-shooting multiple pics pushing the button once (a series of pictures only miliseconds apart from each-other).<br /><br />As you can clearly see, I am not very experienced with cameras and I don't even know what half the features are called. But I was able to take magnificent pictures without even opening the manual! :)<br /><br />The things I learned that I wish I knew earlier on are:<br /><br />1) when taking night shots, use a tripod or lower the ISO. It was very hard to keep might shots from becomming very blurry. (The shutter is generally opened for longer to allow in more light.) If you are taking pictures of moving objects (such as people) in the dark, and don't want to use a flash (to keep more of the background in or for whatever other reason) you can lower the shutter speed beforehand. Look it up in the manual because it's not easy to explain or very intuitive.<br /><br />2) Most of the time pictures will look better without the flash, but (as mentioned above) you need a steady hand or a good tripod. Sports mode helps a bit as it lowers the shutter speed some.<br /><br />3) When you take a landscape picture where the mountains (or whatever) are dark and the sky very bright, you will notice that the exposure tends to be lighter, taking out much of the detail from the mountains. To fix this, you lower the frame a bit (focus on the mountains with the sky barely visible in the shot) and then lightly press the shoot button and hold it down while the camera focuses. Then (still holding the button half-way down to keep camera focused) slightly raise the camera so your frame is now half landscape and half sky. Then finish pressing the shoot button completing the picture. The exposure stays locked to the darker mountains allowing for more detail in the shot.<br /><br />4) For landscapes or anything more than 10 meters from your camera, everything will automatically be in focus so there is no need to worry about it. (In Yosemite I was often worried that if I focused on a waterfall, rather than the rocks around it the shot might turn out strange, but it all was crisp and beautiful regardless of which I chose to use as the focus point.)<br /><br />Last minute advice: Make sure you...<br /><br />1) get one (or more) 256 or 512 flash card as the measly one that comes with the camera only allows for about 20-30 pictures. I recommend SanDisk 512 which Amazon currently sells for under $40. 512 Mb will give you well over 350 pictures on the default settings. (I believe I got 385 or so on mine.)<br /><br />2) get 2 sets of rechargable batteries and a car-charger.<br /><br />3) get a case with a silky lining that snugly fits your camera so as not to scratch anything. And make sure it has an outside pocket for extra batteries and an extra flash card. I recommend one that closes completely (with a zipper) so it will get protected from rain or if you drop it in a puddle or something.<br /><br />That's all. Happy photo-shooting! :)","I can blindly purchase Canon's Digicam, they are so reliable. I was looking for a camera that can provide me the a resolution together with a proper zoom.<br /><br />This camera comes my way as it provides 3x optical zoom solving my purpose and a good resolution with 5MP at a pretty reasonable cost.","Like all these guys who wrote reviews for this item, I too did my homework and did a lot of research. I wanted nothing but the best value for my money and I never regret buying this camera. Pictures are excellent, esp. if you know how to maximize the capability of this camera.<br /><br />The swiveling screen is very convenient not only to protect the LCD screen but for viewing odd-angled shots.<br /><br />It uses standard size AA battery which is very handy if you run out of battery along the road and find yourself with no charger at hand.<br /><br />One more thing, you can even add attachments to its lens if you want to inscrease its zoom power.","I loved using this camera! It's so easy to figure out and all the explanations are right on the flip out screen so there's no guessing which setting you are on. I used it to shoot fast moving waterfalls, and acrobats. It worked well at night and even caught fireworks and pyrotechnics perfectly. The 14 different shooting modes allow for any type of picture taking. All my wedding pictures look like they were done professionally and that makes my husband and I very happy with this camera (the first item we bought together).","I hestitated to move from an SLR film to digital, but was getting my film digitized anyway when it was developed.  I did the numbers on the expense and decided that the camera would pay for itself in a year!  I have not been disappointed.  The camera takes sharp pictures at a resolution that approaches publishing quality.<br /><br />Memory Card: I bought a 256mb card with the camera and it will hold 176 full resolution pictures.  That's seven rolls of film worth of pictures!<br /><br />Battery life: I bought Energizer NiMH batteries and recharger with the camera.  I have yet to run out of battery power while shooting.  I took a full card of pictures (176) over several days and reviewed my shots several times and still had battery life.  Not only that, but the batteries recharge in 15 minutes!<br /><br />Features: I have yet to use all the features (14 settings), but took pictures of a soccer game using the sports setting and the pictures were sharp. The macro takes great shots and have had some of my pictures published in a magazine.  The panorama feature let's you take multiple shots and \"stich\" them together on your computer.  The first time I used the panorama feature I did a 12\" x 72\" panorama of Sedona that is breath-taking.  I'm trying to upload some of my shots.<br /><br />Bottom line:  There is no longer a reason to hang onto film.  The quality is there to please all but most discriminating amateur.  It's nice to see the shot immediately and try again if you blew it.  You can delete the bad ones and just print what you want.  And if you get the \"shot of a lifetime,\" know that the quality is there to have it enlarged or published!","I just got my A95 after a lot of research.  If you are still researching, look no further, it doesn't get any better than this all in one camera.  I will post some photos later that I took on \"auto\" as an amateur right out of the box...my wife and kids think I'm a great photographer now!  There are no real downfalls to this camera that I've found.  I read about ppl complaining about shutter lag and focusing problems, rest assured, unless you are a tecno/digital camera geek you won't notice anything.  I tried out the Nikon 5200 and others and they take longer and have a hard time in dark rooms.<br /><br />I was slightly surprised that the included CF card filled up after a couple photos.  I was sure glad I bought a 512 mb cf on ebay for $27 to go with the camera.  I also bought ni/mh 2500 aa rechargable batteries and was slightly dissapointed that the charge only lasted me a day and a half of leisurely shooting. but thats why its recommended to get an extra set.<br /><br />I am mostly interested in close-up's.  I own a nursery and sell plants online and I needed something good for macro.  If you have been wondering about this, stop here.  This takes superb close-ups once you learn the easy macro-mode button and practice a little.<br /><br />Overall, all I can say is \"wow\".  Also the best place to buy right now is beach camera. buy the accessories through ebay though.  I am now 100% outfitted now for $330!<br /><br />Nice work Canon!","I surfed and \"googled\" and read all sorts of reviews (including here at Amazon) before settling on the Canon A95.  Boy, am I glad I did!<br /><br />This little gem takes gorgeous pictures, under a wide range of conditions, and with no fussiness.  The controls are relatively easy to figure out (even for me, a digital virgin!), and the camera is just the right size to slip into a fanny pack and take on a trip.  It's got enough heft to help you avoid camera shake, too, which I appreciate.  And the swiveling LCD screen is a beaut!<br /><br />So far, I've just experimented in the AUTO mode but, for now, that's more than enough to get the job done.  And I'm very pleased with the results.<br /><br />FWIW: a previous reviewer grumbled about the dull look of pictures on the computer screen.  You can easily adjust that with the software that comes with the camera.<br /><br />Bottom line: Canon knows what they are doing, and they are doing it supremely well!  This is my third Canon -- I also have a Rebel SLR and a SureShot point and shoot -- and this just reaffirms for me that they are simply the best.<br /><br />Read the reviews, look around -- and come back to the one little camera everyone is  crowing about.  You'll be glad.  Like me :-)","I did a lot of research before actually settling on this A 95 from Cannon.  The pictures look great on the LCD screen and if you hook them up on the TV, but when you download them on the PC and look at them, they kind of look dull. It was so disappointing to see the same pictures that were so vibrant and colorful on the LCD screen and on TV, look dark and lifeless.<br /><br />I played with the camera by increasing the resolution and the compressoin of the picture, but to no affect.  I took with many different lighting (indoor and outdoor) but I still couldn't get the pictures to have some life when I downloaded them on the PC.<br /><br />I finally returned the camera. I am back to my Nikon SLR and Film rolls until I get a good Digital. I am now thinking of trying for the Nikon Digital SLR. The only thing is those are not easy to carry..","The get-a-Canon Powershot-for-free \"offers\" you see spewed everywhere on Amazon don't work! All you will get is a gigantic flood of junk email, telemarketing calls, and junk faxes.<br /><br />Get the real scoop from the San Francisco Chronicle. Search sfgate.com for \"David Lazarus free ipod not really\" and you will see what these jokers are really up to.","Having owned a canon a40(nice camera but only 2 mega-pixel),<br /><br />I bought a canon a75 and was fairly happy with it until it<br /><br />was stolen. Now I bought the Canon A95, and it's a big improvement on the A75, much clearer pictures, better color saturation in the pictures, better build quality, and a few more mega-pixels which is nice for cropping<br /><br />pictures. So I my humble opion I would recommend this camera<br /><br />without reservation. And those looking at the A75 I would recommend spending the extra money for this model.","Canon's A95 is another mixed bag from Canon. It's main goal is to try to be a G series camera for 300.00. In this regard it falls short in both speed and sharpness, but not by much. As with all P&S cameras of any price, the A95 poses quite a few obstacles to the shooter. Focus lag, limited F-stop range, punchy flash are among them. On the other hand it has excellent color balance (a big problem for cameras like the Nikon 8800, ALL Panasonics, Konica Minolta Z5 and so on). Sharpness is average for a camera in this class. For sports, kid photography and any highly critical use, most advanced shooters won't be happy with anything less than a DSLR. I bought the A95 for use on the job and as a backup camera. On the other hand the average shooter will probably LOVE the A95. It's a remarkably well made camera capable of taking great shots with some practice. If you don't need giant prints 11X14 or larger, a camera like the A95 is probably a smarter buy than many of the prosumer units currently available. Also keep in mind that those long zoom cameras do best outdoors in bright light where their contrast based focus systems work well. The A95 works best OUT of it's full auto modes. Learn to use the manual settings and you'll be taking plenty of great pictures. I highly recommend the Canon A95, but do your homework carefully and try one if possible. It's a solid pick for a family camera, enthusiast seeking a well priced starter camera or as a backup for your DSLR.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />> Superior handling and ergonomics compared to compacts<br /><br />> Reasonably sharp for mid size camera<br /><br />> VG AF system<br /><br />> Bayonet lens system for additional lenses<br /><br />> Nice viewfinder<br /><br />> Great swivel LCD<br /><br />> Easy manual control<br /><br />> Amazing color balance for a P&S<br /><br />> Excellent macro mode<br /><br />> usable manual focus<br /><br />> Powerful flash<br /><br />> Solidly built<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />> Noise above ISO 100 as with all P&S is limiting<br /><br />> Focus lag as with all P&S limits use for getting fast kiddy pics and such.<br /><br />> Dual menu system sucks<br /><br />> Limited F-stop range just like most P&S cameras<br /><br />> Camera is heavy with 4 AAs<br /><br />> mediocre movie mode<br /><br />> Flash blows highlights in AUTO modes in certain conditions<br /><br />> AF assist should be brighter<br /><br />> No remote option! C'mon!<br /><br />Compared to:<br /><br />The 8800: The Canon can't match the Nikon 8800's quality and lens no way-no-how, but it shoots faster and will get more shots in focus. It also has far better color balance than the 8800 by a royal mile. Outdoors the Canon can't compete at all. Indoors I'd rather shoot with the Canon.<br /><br />The Pentax Optio S5i: The tiny Pentax lens did very well by comparison, but the Canon has the edge for color and sharpness. Pentax had better low light AF, but longer focus lag.<br /><br />The Sony L1: I love the L1. It fails in ergnomics but it's a ultra compact anyway. If not for the memory stick pro I might have bought one. At 199.00 its a steal! The A95 won out due to being able to share my D70 cards.<br /><br />The Nikon D70: The Canon's only advantage over the D70 is it's size. For some applications, the Canon's swivel display might also give it a leg up. The D70 has no movie mode of any kind. Beyond that the D70 simply takes better pics than any P&S/Prosumer. Happy shooting!","Like one reviewer noticed this in his experience, the only thing that bothers me too is the fact that the pics look simply fantastic in the LCD but when seen on a monitor later look kind of washed-out. I know, smaller screens show a crisper image and a difference in quality is to be expected when viewing the same image on a big monitor. But after the enthusiasm that lovely and vibrant image you just took has generated, it's a sudden let-down when you see it on a monitor, where most people really see images anyway. Haven't printed an image yet.<br /><br />A brightness/contrast control for the LCD would sure help to get a better judgement of what's seen on the LCD and what to expect on a monitor later. Otherwise, the camera is a delight !","I did some (infact a lot of) research on buying a digital camera. For a beginner with lot of enthusiasm to experiment with photography, choosing the right camera is the toughest part. I started evaluating basic 3MP cameras and extended my evaluation upto Nikon D70 and Canon EOS20.<br /><br />After more than a month's research, I decided upon Canon A95. It has been three months since I purchased this camera and I am completely satisfied with the product and I can recommend it unequivocally for beginner and amateur shutterbugs (thanks to A95 I am evolving into an amateur from beginner).<br /><br />The best features are it is 5MP, crisp and swivel LCD, a whole range of Manual controls and a whole range of pre-configured shooting modes (including b&w and sepia), faster focussing, excellent night shooting capability, runs on 4 AA batteries (yesterday I took more than 200 pictures and the batteries are still ready to go) and many more (don't be lazy; find out the other features yourself ;-))<br /><br />Performance:<br /><br />- Excellent picture quality (yes much much better than Sony cameras and Nikon non-DSLR cameras)<br /><br />- Excellent color quality<br /><br />- easy learning curve<br /><br />- I can't stop myself from over-stressing the point - \"ABSOLUTELY no red eye\". I can't imgaine why people pay bunch of additional bucks to Sony (I was Sony fan too, but Sony cameras Su**) to get those Devil eyes. Yes I tested with flash in low light conditions as well, but red eye is not at all there when you shoot with A95<br /><br />- Excellent battery life (I purchased the energiser 15 min charger with 4 rechargeable batteries for 27 bucks and the only complaint I have about the 15 min charger is - it takes 18 minutes for charging 4 batteries :-) )<br /><br />- Excellent macro mode capability<br /><br />- Excellent flash performance (When I decided about this camera, the only point that was pushing me back was non-availability of hotshoe on this camera. I thought I would buy an L-flash set if required, but now I am sure I don't need an external flash)<br /><br />Let's come to bad news - Purple fringing. It is very obvious when you have a bright light focussed onto a shiny surface. It's almost like you can reproduce it at your will. But let me tell you, any 5MP (or more) non-DSLR camera suffers from purple fringing (I am sure you might have heard about DSC F828 and it's infamous purple fringing.). The options to avoid purple fringing are -<br /><br />- Go for a lesser MP camera (and lose some cool features that A95 has to offer)<br /><br />- Go for a Digital SLR camera (and lighten your wallet)<br /><br />- buy some UV filters<br /><br />- use photoshop to reduce the PF from your pictures.<br /><br />Though I have been thinking about buying UV filter, I haven't tried it yet because I have been avoiding PF by selecting different shots.<br /><br />Don't get frightened by all those horror stories about the \"flimsy CF Card door). I agree, Canon could have built a better door, but as long as you are a grownup you can handle the door smoothly.<br /><br />I have a canon optura 20, so I haven't evaluated the mpeg recording mode on A95.<br /><br />Conclusion (ofcourse it is my conclusion) - If your skill level  is beginner-amateur and you are enthusiastic about photography, do yourself a favour and buy this camera. For those who consider themselves above this level, you can also add this camera to your armory as you don't need an SLR for every shot.","Ok a brief intro and then onto pro's and cons:<br /><br />For the price, this is an amazing camera. I have been studying photography for a while now and was quite the newbie when I originally purchased the A95. After 4 months, and after taking several hundred pics, I can safely say that I have learned very well the strenghts and weaknesses of this camera.<br /><br />It has the size of a point and shoot, but the flexibility of a SLR.<br /><br />So in point, for the 300+ dollars you pay for this camera you are DEFINETELY getting something of better quality that others in the same bracket of price. However, what you are not getting is DSLR quality by any means. (At least $1000.00 for one of those) The powershot series from Canon is fantastic, and the A95 is currently at the top of that series.<br /><br />PRO's: (just to name a few)<br /><br />-Its lightweight, activates quickly with very little lag, and has better than average performance.<br /><br />-Has ISO 50 (rare) through 400<br /><br />-Full manual options<br /><br />-Rotating LCD with auto gain is such an awesome thing I cant even begin to tell you.<br /><br />-Has the ability to take an adapter lens which lets you accesorize with telephoto, macro, and wide angle lenses, as well as an assortment of filters to really get those amazing shots. (which i own and put to good use)<br /><br />-Takes rechargeable AA batteries !  Vs special batteries that cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />-Its a still pic camera, not a video camera, I am not even going to commment on the shortcomings of the movie feature, its not even relevant to any photographer.<br /><br />-White balance, and autofocus are great and the Canon's DiG!C matrix produces clear and beautifully colored images.<br /><br />-Lets just say it has a TON of options and features that really  make this camera a powerhouse amongst its competitors in the same price bracket.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-Anything higher than 100 ISO produces a lot of 'noise' in your pics.<br /><br />-The zoom is really weak<br /><br />-The flash should be in a different position and causes a good deal of 'red eye' even with the red eye reduction feature on. However the software that comes with it removes it easily.<br /><br />-Metering options are close to DSLR, but honestly when you see an SLR pic and features you really become aware of the limitations of this camera.<br /><br />-only comes with a 32mb memory card, pretty much forcing you to  get a larger one.<br /><br />Overall as a mid-range camera between a standard point and shoot and a DSLR I give this a 4 Star rating. 5 would be perfect and since there are cons a perfect score is just not going to happen.<br /><br />If you are going to buy a digital camera just to have one, this camera is going to have more options than you will ever want or use. If however you want to get into photography and dont want to start off with a 1,200.00 price tag this camera is definetely for you !<br /><br />P.S  It will take you a good month to really understand the 'concept' of the options in this camera, and another 3 to be able to really use them and take great pics. Expect to fumble around for a while before you really grasp digital photography.  I recommmend \"Complete Digital Photography third edition\" by Ben Long as a necessary accessory to this camera. Without that book it would have taken me 4 years verses 4 months to grasp digital photography and digital cameras.  Hope that helps. =)","I have had this camera for about three months now and have taken a variety of shots and used all of the different settings and features that come packed in it.  There are some good things and bad things about it, but overall I am satisfied with what it has to offer and the price tag that comes along with it!<br /><br />The Good Things:<br /><br />- Small, light weight<br /><br />- Different modes and features<br /><br />- Manual Mode, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority<br /><br />- Slow Shutter Speed Effect<br /><br />- Kids & Pets Mode<br /><br />- Vivid Mode to make the colors really stand out<br /><br />- 5 MegaPixels and size resolution to blow up prints to 8 x 11 / 11 x 14 in size<br /><br />- Good for beginners and those that are just beginning to delve into the technical side of photography (good for practice)<br /><br />- Flip out screen.  You may think, why do I need that?  Believe me, it comes in handy for shots where you find it hard to see the screen.  And for travel, it protects the LCD from getting smudged and banged around.  And... helps protect it from fingerprints!<br /><br />- Hand grip- very nice and comfortable in your hand.  Not really tiny and small like some other cameras where you can't get a nice grip and you feel like you're going to drop it!<br /><br />The Bad Things (in my honest opinion):<br /><br />- If you shoot your children (or even moving people) in Auto Mode on a cloudy day, you are going to get blurred pictures.  To be safe, always use the Kids and Pets setting.<br /><br />- Noise - this camera has a noise problem, which will make your print out look `grainy'.  I am not sure why it has so much noise, I am thinking that it's because of the small sensors packing that 5 MP together when it saves to your card, but I can't be sure.  This is the biggest disappointment for me.  With my SONY Mavica 2 MP camera, noise barely existed.  If you make a jump from a small MP camera to a larger one, this is going to be an issue, especially in low light situations.<br /><br />- Purple fringing.  On a bright day, if your subject is white and the sky is bright, or there are lights nearby and the subject has on a bright shirt, you will find that along the edges of their clothing will be a small purple `haze' effect.  You may be the only one to really notice it, but others might.<br /><br />- Red eye.  Unless your subject is looking directly at the `red beam' on the camera when taking a picture using the flash, you are more than likely going to get red eye.  This can be easily taken out with a graphics program, but it is still a pain in the butt to deal with.<br /><br />- ISO only going up to 400- and at that, the noise is awful!  For normal picture takers, if you plan on taking pictures at a sporting event, don't even mess with the ISO Setting.  Just use the Sports Mode on the Dial.  And make sure the game is outside in the day time.  Otherwise, noise is going to be in your prints and you may be disappointed with the results.<br /><br />- Zoom is only 3x, you might not get as close to your subject as you would like when zooming.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Like I said, there are good things to this camera, and some bad, but all in all, I think that it's a good investment for those who want a higher megapixel camera with more features to play around with.<br /><br />I've uploaded some pictures I've taken in the \"Customer Images\" section, but all the photographs there are helpful.","This camera totally rocks. It is very easy to use, and the screen turns both ways. I have bought this camera and i love it with all my heart. THe best camera for it's price on the market.","Sorry about my opinion is different. I ordered this camera from Dell.com after I read these reviews. But, to be honest, I'm disappointed with this camera after I compared the pictures I took with my Fuji FinePix 2650, which is only 2Meg. the pictures taken by my old Fuji are much much more sharp, clear and pure. the pictures taken by this canon camera look like some mist on it. So I decide to return this and buy Fuji E550 (6.3M),  also don't need pay much more money. you also can visit \"fatwallet\" to get what some customers heard from tech.","I got this camera a couple of months ago and I am very pleased with it.  The quality of the photos is nice for the price.  It's not terribly small or lightweight but that wasn't a major concern for me.<br /><br />I love the rotatable LCD.  It's nice to be able to take pictures of me and my son together when no one else is around!<br /><br />This camera also takes videos, something that I wasn't aware of when I purchsed it.  The videos include sound and you can make one for as long as you like so long as you have a large enough memory card.  This has been a great feature for me to send videos to my son's father who is currently deployed in Iraq.<br /><br />My one recommendation if you buy this camera is that you get rechargeable batteries.  It only took me a couple of weeks to go through a set of normal batteries and my rechargeable ones have lasted much longer and are still going strong.<br /><br />I definitely suggest checking out other online vendors of these cameras as I got mine for a lot cheaper on another site.","The best digital camera that I have ever used and I had many Olympus cameras that are way bellow the image quality of this digital camera. Pictures are incredible, life like and very colorful. The only bad picture that this camera produces was at night where there where street light and it tried to take a picture of the moon. The light compensation was bad but considering that I was taking the picture without a tripod it was really good. It has a feature for every type of lighting, and you can also choose to go fully manual and change everything at your hearts content even the focus can done manually. You can by al lens if you want more zoom but it cost almost as much as the camera so I don't really recommend to buy the lens, specially because the zoom that it gives its not that much. The amount of megapixes is the perfect one because it's over 3MP that is more or less the quality of the film cameras and is does not produce pictures that are too big for any memory card lick the 7MP cameras. The choice of form factor for the memory card is perfect because is one of the cheapest and its one of the type of flash cards that can have more memory. Overall its the best mid range digital camera that you can find on the market and the price is fare considering all of the features that the camera has, the software that it comes with and the fact that you can rotate the screen close it so it can be protected by the camera not the other way round.","I had various film cameras and digital cameras. This one is newest addition and my first 5 MP Digital. As with my experience, my hunch is right that I can trust Canon. Excellent picture quality and ease of operation and handling. I like camera of this size in hand. Overall, I am highly satisfied with this product","I recently replaced my Canon S400 4MP Elph with the Powershot A95.<br /><br />Right away, the main differences are:<br /><br />Larger size, partly due to the use of 4 AA batteries.  the compartment where the batteries are stored make the camera have an excellent grip which makes the camera friendly for larger hands then the Elph series does.  (I'm a woman in my 20's, and I have small hands so this doesn't really affect me)<br /><br />The batteries, being AA's, not a rechargable Lithium Ion like the Elph, can be easily be bought at any store that sells AA's cheap if you run out while you're on vacation (which will happen often, as digital suck the life out of normal AA batteries)<br /><br />Saying that, I STRONGLY encourage you to purchase rechargable Ni-MH batteries.  I bought the Sony Super Quick BCG34HC charger, which also comes with 4 2300 Ni-MH batteries.  The batteries lasted about a week and a half of heavy picture taking with the the flash on and off, along with the display on.  For and extra twenty bucks on Amazon, it's worth it.<br /><br />The LCD is slightly larger.<br /><br />In addition, the LCD also flips out and around!  You can easily frame and take pictures of you and a friend without having to use the self timer.<br /><br />The manual features are far supieror to the Elph series.  The A95 Powershot allows manual focusing!  And aperature settings!  This is a far improvement and gives you a little more creative control over images.  The camera still has a complete auto setting should you just want to use it as a simple point and shoot.<br /><br />The lenses on the Powershot A95 are interchangable.  You can buy telephoto lenses for it (though you must also purchase an adapter for any interchangable lenses for this camera)  I think the idea is cool, but the lens and the adapter are NOT cheap.  If you bought the camera and the lenses and the adapter, you could spend an extra fifty or hundred dollars and then just get the digital rebel which would allow total creative control with fully manual settings.  Again, a fun idea, but maybe try to find the lenses used at a cheaper price.<br /><br />The camera turns on quickly like the Elph, and has the same small shutter lag.  It's not bad, but in low light it takes extra time to focus.<br /><br />The only qualm I really have with this camera is the LCD screen is WAY too bright.  Images look washed out and have innaccurate colors on the LCD screen then when you get them on the computer and print them out.  And the worst part about it is, you can't fix it.  There is NO way to adjust the brightness level of the LCD screen.  On the S400 Elph, you could adjust the brightness level of the LCD screen, on the A95 you cannot.  I like seeing my images how they will look when I am changing controls so I gett a correct picture the first time (the whole point of a digital camera!)  I think this is an oversight on Canons part and the brightness option should be included on future models.<br /><br />Basically, what it comes down to is, if you want a camera just for keeping in your purse and using it at parties and simple settings and the like, I would always reccomend the Canon Digital Elph Series.  They're small and have incredible image quality.<br /><br />However, if you want more createive control and the ability to use some manual controls, by all means buy this camera.  It can be easily used as a point and shoot, but it really is so much more.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with the camera and all of the scene modes and extra controls.  It's a nice step up from the camera I was using.","This camera is fantastic.  I always thought that with a point and shoot, you were stuck with poor lighting and strange hues.  However, the manual settings on this camera make it relatively easy to make your pictures look less like disposable film camera snapshots and more like photographs.  At first, I thought the rotating LCD was a little silly and extravagant, but it is wonderful for two reasons.  First, you can fold it away when you store the camera in a bag (or pocket) and save your screen from the scratches and dings that normally happen when you use a digital camera.  Second, it works really well for taking self portraits or shots from over your head (say, if you're in a crowd of people.)  The scene modes are a bit of a novelty, but a good place to start.  The manual mode (where you can actually control the flash intensity) is far more useful.  Another great feature is the custom white balance.  If you really can't be bothered figuring out the difference between incandescent, fluorescent H and regular fluorescent light, just point the camera at a white t-shirt and press a button.  The camera is now set for your lighting.  If you want to get artsy, do the same thing with something blue or pink and get effects similar to color infrared film.  Anyway, the only complaint I have is that I paid for Amazon 2 day shipping, and it took 4 business days to get my camera (3 of them in transit via UPS ground.)","A95 is an excellent choice for a 5MP digital camera on it own. But Canon has fully redesigned the Powershot A series to make it lighter (uses only 2 AA batteries now), smaller and with 4x optical zoom in A510/A520. Its a tough choice between A520 and A95 now.<br /><br />Pro's,<br /><br />1. Very good image quality.<br /><br />2. 5 MP and 3x optical zoom (A520 is the new 4MP/4X version).<br /><br />3. Priced right, unlike some overpriced digicams out there.<br /><br />4. Works on normal AA batteries (buy rechargeable ones for extra life and lower cost), unlike expensive & hard-to-find propreitary batteries.<br /><br />5. The menu on the Canon cameras is light years ahead of most other manufacturer's. Lots of manual options and scene modes.<br /><br />6. Battery and SD card doors seem to be of above average quality.<br /><br />7. LCD screen is bright and fluid.<br /><br />8. Uses standard SD cards, unlike propretary memory cards like Memory Stick or xD card.<br /><br />9. Can attach extra lenses if one buys the adaptor for it.<br /><br />10. Actual LCD screen looks nicely protected below a plastic plate.<br /><br />11. Flip out LCD for hard-to-shoot shots.<br /><br />12. Better build quality, IMO, than newer A510/A520.<br /><br />Con's,<br /><br />1. The camera is very thick & bulky (uses 4AA batteries).<br /><br />2. Only 3x optical zoom, compared to 4x on newer A series.<br /><br />3. Doesn't have that cool-ness like iPod or Elph series.<br /><br />4. Weak flash and redeye remain an issue, a compromise for small overall size.<br /><br />You gotta spend more money to buy Elph series for more pocketability & style. This will be replaced with smaller, lighter 5MP/4x A series camera soon.<br /><br />However if you find this for an attractive price, go ahead. You can't go wrong with Canon. Just check out the top sellers list right here on Amazon!","I had big huge description on what was so wonderful about the A95 then I realized I was just repeating what all the other reviews were saying about this camera. Here something different I can add....<br /><br />I bought and return 4 different digital cameras before I got the powershot A95. The Reason I went through so many digital cameras was because I own a SLR Canon EOS Rebel (I paid $500 for it 8 yrs ago) I absolutely Love my Rebel all my picture come out beautifully clear and I'm Never disappointed but it's not digital. I was so stuck on my rebel that when I used the Kodak, Minolta, Nikon & HP digital cameras (in same price range as canon) they just didn't measure up to my Rebels different setting & photo quality and that is why I would return them!!!<br /><br />Finally I realized I need to try a canon digital and pick the powershot A95 (because of it's small size). I LOVE this camera you won't see me returning it!!!  What I like the most about this digital over the others I've owned is that it has all the setting my rebel has, Plus 8 more setting my rebel doesn't.<br /><br />****For those who have used a Rebel before, if you haven't it's not as hard to use as it sounds below****<br /><br />With my Rebel to get a better blur free photo of my kids moving, I usually had to set the aperture myself, then adjust the ISO then set the filtration (which you can also do on powershot A95) But with the A95 you just set your dial to SCN then pick \"kids & pet\" & it does all the work for you, the picture will come out Blur free every time & you won't have to mess with any apertures, ISO or anything. It also has \"indoor\" setting, if you have a Bright lamp on (like 4-- 100watt bulb fan light) on in the house you can turn the Flash OFF (trust me turn it off and you won't have to worry about red eye either) and the indoor setting will make your picture come out like you used a flash, it's better then Auto setting!!!<br /><br />I agree with the others reviews that the powershot A95 does get red eye sometime (just like you will with any digital with a Built in flash). Here is a tip to keep in mind, the ONLY way to guarantee zero red eye in every picture is you'll need to buy a Digital with an -------Attachable flash------- (means you can take the flash off the camera) attachable flashes have more power, more light and better reflection against red eye but those type of digital cost about $1,400+ !!! For under $300 for powershot A95 you won't be disappointed.","I love this camera! The price is fantastic for the feature set -- which rivals that of cameras hundreds of dollars more expensive. Color rendition is near perfect, but I've noticed it tends to underplay a little unless you've got very good light. (say a sunset or bright daylight) Purple fringing is a problem when shooting bright objects in bright sun, but you can avoid that most of the time. The camera is a very nice size, and unlike some who find it heavy, I find the weight just makes it seem like it's worth every dime I paid for it. The battery compartment forms a very nice handhold - often non-existant on other models. The controls are very clear, very user friendly, and very ergonomic. The buttons are where you expect them to be. The LCD screen is big and bright - though not so useful in very bright light. One warning about the LCD screen -- it's often *better* than the conditions you're photographing. Because it's so well lit, it can make you think the scene you capture is that bright, and you might be disappointed to get home later and find the picture very dark. (enter Photoshop...)<br /><br />The scenes provided to help the amateur/novice photographer are almost universally good, though indoor shots still need a little correction. Image quality is terrific, but I'm a sharpness freak and find myself doing post-process sharpening quite often. I suspect the average user will be pleased with the camera as is.<br /><br />You could spend 300 - 5000 more for a higher mp rating, but you'll be hard pressed to find one this good, for this little money. It's a steal at twice the price.","I did tons (too much) research, so I thought I'd share the main reasons I pulled the trigger on this camera and not others:<br /><br />1) Price/Rating Balance--it's well reviewed at many sites, including being the #2 rated 5 megapixel by CNET<br /><br />2) The flip out LCD.  Means a few things: your LCD is protected when closed (thats a big deal); multiple people can look at it since you can angle it (like you and your spouse); and depending on the light you can angle it to see the screen better.  Also, you can shoot with it closed of course.<br /><br />3) The batteries.  Using your own rechargeable or even disposable is an advantage, not disadvantage!  Gives you flexibility and 6 months from now you aren't buying another $80 special battery like you will with other models.  Thats why Canon does that with some models--people like the flexibility.  We bought a nice rechargeable set for $25 from a local camera store complete with car charger.  (We don't belive you have to use Canon rechargeables)<br /><br />4) The features.  I have already mastered the basics but the abilites this camera has are probably more than we will ever need, but are there if we want.  Like one review site said, this camera will grow with you.<br /><br />5) Size and handling.  Its big enough that you feel comfortable with it in your hand, and the controls are great.  Its not the lightest due to the batteries, but for us its more of a family camera, not some little matchbook I wanted to take out to bars with my friends.  The only thing is that it would probably not be comfortable hanging around your neck if you wanted that.  But on a waist no problem!","After receiving a gift certificate at work, I did a lot of research on available cameras.  The Canon Powershots had a great rating on another web site, so I went to store to check them out.  I have very large hands for a woman, so I was very concerned about the size of the small digital cameras, and if I would be able to use one comfortably.  This camera rocks!  It is so easy to use!  I'm not a beginner, but if I were, I could still use this camera the first time out.  I love the flexibility of the screen and the transfer to e-mail is flawless.  Buy a card scanner though...makes it much safer for the camera.  Crisp, clean shots and small enough to drop in a jacket pocket...vacation heaven.  Get extra media cards...the A95 gives you a few less pictures for the space, but the quality is worth it.<br /><br /> Down side?  The cover on the media card doesn't feel sturdy.  You will need to be careful opening it.  Still trying to find where to get an attachment lens at a good price.  (yes, you can add on just like an SLR) Also, would have been nice if rechargeable batteries were included.  You'll want them if you shoot a lot at one time.  Actually, there are almost too many options on the A95.  Unbelievable how much you can do with it for this price.<br /><br />Very good looking camera, very easy to hold and use, great advanced features for someone past the beginner stage and after using it for a month, I am very pleased with it!","Bought A95 in January and have been enjoying it ever since.<br /><br />This is our first digital camera and I love the fact that the pictures we print out are all quality pictures....not pictures of the back of a head....or someone looking away.<br /><br />I don't think that you can go wrong with this camera.  Purchase it; read the manual take an hour to get familiar with the camera and the software and picture taking/editing is very simple.<br /><br />Movie mode good - fine for quick movies to send to relatives...recorded some of my son's fist steps and sent them out to friends...<br /><br />Battery life bad for AA batteries...have to buy rechargeable batteries....I actually bought the Cannon rechargeables - after actually visiting Circuit City and seeing that only the cheap batteries were really cheap.<br /><br />Red-eye does exist, but it is very simple to remove it when editing...simply zoom in and remove.....","buying the a95 was one of those rare purchases that far exceeds what you had hoped for and expected.<br /><br />the other reviews on this camera explain enough of the detail of its workings and quality, but i will mention what impressed me with this one.<br /><br />- the fold out lcd (makes taking photos of yourself easy)<br /><br />- the macro zoom function (i can get decent shots at less than 6 inches with this)<br /><br />- the picture effects (sepia, black and white, vivid colour etc)<br /><br />- f.stop, iso speed and shutter speed (you can adjust these all manually!)<br /><br />- uses 4 AA batteries (cheap as chips to buy rechargeables and when they get old, just get some new ones - no mucking around with dodgy internal batteries - and you get about 400 pictures per charge, even more in low power mode)<br /><br />- panoramic images (can take a bunch of shots in panoramic mode, then the software included, which i think is great, stitches them all together beautifully to make great panoramic images!) you can even turn then into quicktime vr movies!<br /><br />- easy to use<br /><br />- plenty of preset lighting situations to select from<br /><br />the only downside to this camera is the 3x zoom, but i'm not a nature photographer or a hunter, so it doesn't matter to me.<br /><br />buy it and be well pleased!","This is my first digital camera and after doing my research I made my choice. This camera is REALLY easy to use. The directions are easy to read and understand. I took my first picture within 5 minutes of opening the box.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that you couldn't take pictures of moving objects very well. I completely agree. The first pictures of my two Beagles were mostly of their tail as they leave the room. So little kids and active dogs are difficult. However, with some practice I learned to be ready for the picture and now they aren't so camera shy.<br /><br />Great little camera. Fits right in my hand. Purchase the accessory kit too. That way you get the recharger, a nice case and an extra set of batteries. The software which comes with the camera is also very very easy to load and use. I say: Buy It!","I got my new Canon A95 for Christmas and I love it!  I won't go into go into all of the technical details of the camera here because you can read the product description or other reviews.  What I will say is this...THIS IS A GREAT CAMERA!  Bottom line: the camera is extremely easy to use and takes crisp, clear, colorful pictures.  It offers 14 different picture-taking modes and works well in daylight and with the flash.  The movable LCD screen is crystal clear (and is cool to show off to your friends, too!).  The camera seems pretty durable and I have not run into the problem with battery life that other reviewers have.  The software accompanying the camera is easy to use, also.  An excellent choice for a \"casual\" photographer who simply wants to capture her/his memories to share with family and friends.","I researched almost every 5MP camera out there, and in comparison the canon A95 powershot surpasses all others.  Although the only complaint seems to be weight, I believe this is attributed to the fact that it takes four AA batteries.  However, if you purchase the rechargables, they last forever.  I took 12 rechargable batteries with me to my colorado ski trip, and in 7 days not once did I have to replace them!  Also, using regular batteries or rechargables is a lot cheaper and more convenient then having to buy the customized batteries for other cameras.<br /><br />What I LOVE about this camera:<br />- there are numerous not-so-happy comments about how long it takes for the canon to take/record the picture.  You can change this setting!!!! It's in the manual.  ALSO, if you have the factory default setting of \"record time\" of a pic, you can still take a picture while the camera is recording the previous one.  FOr instance, you take a pic, it's on the LCD screen.... you can take another shot right away using the viewfinder.  For pics that would involve high speeds where you would like to take a series of shots, you can change the shutter speed manually, or use the fast/slow shutter speed option on the dial<br />- the flip-panel LCD screen is an excellent feature.  No worries about scratching the screen especially when extreme skiing and you've got this bad boy in your jacket pocket =)<br />- rechargable battery life is extremely long<br />- the optical combined with the digital zoom allowed for extreme close-ups of the farthest of objects... add the macro function and the quality becomes even better<br />- easy to understand and use even for those unfamiliar with different shutter speeds, aperture values,etc.<br />- quality quality and more quality of photos<br />- color and contrast using various settings amazed me!<br />- I like when previewing my picture that I can see what functions were used when the picture was taken, the histogram display, the white balance effect used, and the date<br />- I love the fact that I don't have to fumble with a lens cap!<br />- it's pict-bridge compatible<br />- the \"up to 20\" panaramic shots that you can take blew me away!  The camera allows you to line up the second picture of your panaramic to the first one you took by showing you the edge of the first panaramic photo!<br /><br />The not so positive effects:<br />- as I sit at my desk pondering my camera, ... I really can't think of a single thing that I didn't like about this camera!<br /><br />I absolutely recommend it!!!","Canon does not pack rechargable batteries and charger which<br /><br />is really bad because<br /><br />1. The alkaline batteries that come with the package die in no<br /><br />  time.<br /><br />2. The rechargable batteries and charger come for 32$ from sony<br /><br />  [NiMH batteries]. Canon's are far costlier in comparison.<br /><br />Also, I find the camera somewhat slow in operation. I mean it<br /><br />takes time to record images into the sandisk cf card. The camera<br /><br />is not as easy-to-use and sleek as I had thought it would be. I<br /><br />have a<br /><br />sony dscp72 camera which came in cheaper and was more handy.<br /><br />The zoom in and out using the semi-rotating switch is not as<br /><br />handy as the two buttons for zoom in and out were in sony camera.<br /><br />Also, the camera buttons (up and down) etc are not easy to get<br /><br />used to. Sony scored far better at this.<br /><br />The camera has not given me any problems as such but it was not<br /><br />quite up to my expectations of easy to use and sleekness.<br /><br />I am still exploring it's many functions which the sony camera<br /><br />lacks and so can't comment on them.","I chose between the A95 and the new Sony DSC-T1 and decided on the Canon because I'd had good luck with their equipment in the past (SLRs and 1st gen digicams).<br /><br />Also I wanted to keep the cost down. I also bought an underwater case, so total cost was $500 -- it would have been at $750 for equivalent Sony equipment.<br /><br />I am happy with the A95, though I wished it shot a little faster (some delay in standard mode). Color, resolution, and features are great.<br /><br />Interestingly, while on Christmas vacation I ran in to a guy who had chosen the Sony set-up. We were both doing underwater photography and he'd just shot a turtle in video mode. He as so excited! His images were nice, too and it was easy for him to show them to me on the Sony's big view screen.<br /><br />It's harder to shoot underwater video on the A95 since the screen is smaller, but the results are as good as the Sony.<br /><br />The Sony definitely has the cool factor though! Still, I can use standard AA batteries and standard memory (I got a SanDisk 1 GB, great!). That made travel easier (no charger) and I don't worry as much about damaging a $300 camera as I might a $500 one.","This is a good camera to use for animation if you will be downloading the pictures and compiling them in the computer. Meaning, the camera alone does not have animation capabilities, but it has several features that make it ideal for shooting a sequence of images to later turn into animation video.<br /><br />1. Auto power shut-off disable: You can set the camera so that it doesn't automatically go to sleep when you haven't taken a picture for a few minutes. This is a big deal for animators--who need time to arrange their art in between frames and can't afford to lose the zoom settings lost in shut-off. However this shut-off disable feature is itself disabled when using the analog video output to see the images on an external monitor. I suspect Canon did this to discourage professional use of a consumer-level camera.<br /><br />2. The screen: It flips out, twists around, and allows you to see the shot from any angle without standing on a chair, craining your neck, etc. Especially great for downshooting flat artwork.<br /><br />If you do get this camera for animation use, be sure to get a power adapter or you'll go through batteries way too fast.","I am not too technical on cameras, and Im an average photographer. I usually take pictures at parties or the holidays. This camera really is an excellent one. It takes some of the clearest pictures! The options on it are great, just like the more expensive ones, but they're made easy. For landscape pictures, you just move it the landscape icon, for portrait pictures, you move it to the portrait icon. Its that simple and the quality is superb. For general pics here and there, just leave it on auto.<br /><br />Id recommend you browse the manual for the basic settings, such as your resolution and such. I bought a 128mb compact flash card and it works fine. So my point is if you have to have a digital, this is it! You can take some nice deep pics like a photographer would, and you can take your regular old fun pictures and enjoy yourself whichever mode you feel you're in! I used to have a Minolta Dimage for 6 years before I upgraded, so you can tell how excited I am!","Someone on the review earlier said there were some reviews written by Canon salesman, but I doubt it.  I'm not a Canon sales person, I'm writing a review just because I like this camera.  Some people said there's some redeye problems, and I agree with that, specially with blue or green eyes seem easy to get redeye results.  Some people worried about the shutter lags, but you can actually change the shutter speed.  \"Kids and Pets\" option is set with faster shutter speed, so it works as well.  It took me for a bit to get used to the shutter speed, but once you learn how to control the camera, it works great for you.  If you are looking for a camera to take snap shots, you might want to look around a little more.<br /><br />It's been over 2 months since I got this camera.  I have very poor skill of taking pictures, but this camera helps me to make the pictures look great!  Everytime I take pictures, I set it as a desktop wallpapar on my computer.  It's easy to use, and I love the fact that I can fold in the LCD screen.  I throw it in my bag, but I don't have to worry about getting it scrached or dirty.  I also got a case for that for $5, so I'm taking the camera everywhere I go.  I did a lot of research for digital camera shopping, and I'm glad that I bought this.  I paid less than $300 including shipping.  [...] : )","Best value for money camera. I like the pre-programmed scene selections. I don't have to worry about the settings and still capture that \"kod*k\" moment. The photoprints are superb! You definitely need to get more CF memory though. The 32Mb that comes with it is definitely not enough. It would also have been better if the lens came with a wider angle.","I hate to write this review b/c i was very excited to get this camera. I had high hopes for it.<br /><br />BUT UNFORTUNATLY it let me down big time....<br /><br />I researched for weeks to find the best digital camera. i researched all over the web on Olympus, Kodak, Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Sony ... all of them. I decided on a Canon b/c they seem to get such great reviews, especially here on Amazon. The praise on here for the Canon A95 really helped sway my decision.<br /><br /> I love digital photography and take a lot of pictures though i am by no means a professional. I mostly wanted a nicer camera than my HP435 (a cheap 100 dollar cam). I bought this powershot a95 based on all the great reviews. i mostly take pictures of my children, who are young.<br /><br />I wanted a good sized megapixel (not too high but more than 3 b/c i print 8x10's often). i teetered on the thought of a higher zoom camera. still debating on the Kodak 7590 which has a 10x optical zoom and 5 or 6 mp. that cam doesnt have any stabalizer like the  canon s1 has (and a 10x zoom but a small mp). I eventually decided against a higher zoom camera and on this a95 b/c everyone said how great it was. i thought i would be able to take quality photos of my kids.<br /><br />Unfortunately the cons of this camera are a big deal for me. It has the problems i was trying to AVOID.<br /><br />CON #1 :  in a lot of my shots, everyone has red eyes. i read the instruction booklet page by page and turned on the redeye reduction but to no avail. red eyes. up close were okay but when the subject got 3 feet away...red eyes. i know i can photo edit them out but i shouldnt have to. a 400 dollar camera should do that for me!<br /><br />CON #2: (the most important thing to me) the time from me pressing the button to take the shot to the time it actually takes the picture is ridiculously long! my kids make a cute face and by the time the camera takes the shot, they have changed faces and/or moved out of the shot. In this respect, my old 100$ hp did a way better job. it was very quick to take the picture. i pressed the button and the picture was taken. not on this camera. i press the button and i guess it is getting the shot perfect b/c it pauses for literally SECONDS then snaps. The picture i do get of say the top of my kids head or the sides of their faces (b/c they MOVED) is a very clear nice shot though.<br /><br />i would say that if you want to take pictures of a still object then this camera does a Great job.<br /><br />BUT---> if you are looking for a camera to take pictures of your small toddlers who won't sit still, do not get this camera.<br /><br />the worst part too is that i bought this at Best Buy and it came with a restocking fee sticker of 15%. SO if i return it, they charge me a good 60 some odd dollars to return it. ridiculous! they didnt tell me about that! so Avoid purchasing at Best Buy unless you are absolutely sure OR you dont mind paying a restocking fee.<br /><br />My sister recently bought the Kodak 7590 and i am going to play with it for a week or so and review it as well.<br /><br />We go down to Florida alot and play w/ the dolphins. (the animals not the team haha) I dont think this camera is going to do a good job taking pics of them either b/c of its slow picture taking time. I imagine i will press the button in time but by the time the photo actually TAKES, the dolphins will be back under water. i will end up with a photo of bubbles where dolphins WERE.<br /><br />This camera DOES have great color and sharp imaging. Lots of buttons and options. It isnt junk by any means. It just isnt what I need.<br /><br />Good luck with your camera shopping. I had a hard time deciding and ended up doing exactly what i tried to avoid: buying the WRONG camera!","Before purchasing this camera, I read and studied reviews and product descriptions.  I have had it about 3 weeks and I love it.  I haven't spent much time learning all the features, just figure them out when the need arises.<br /><br />I have made some great photos without really reading the manual.  These include a lot of indoor shots made without flash.<br /><br />Pluses:  ease of use, rotating lcd, inexpensive batteries, and<br /><br />great photos.","I bought the camera for myself with the intent of showing my parents how much more useful it is than the old style film devleoping camera.  Nut shell: old dogs sometimes would rather you peddle your tricks somewhere else.  I do think it would have taken a large amount of work to teach them even if they were willing.  My parents don't exactly keep up with technology.  My mother is still only playing solitare on the computer I bought her last year.<br /><br />  Though there are a large number of configuration options, I was able to learn quickly how to take night time pictures with exposure adjustments.  The pivotal screen makes the camera twice as useful.  Much easier to take difficult photos like using a tripod (for a tall person like myself)<br /><br />This camera will likely be a bargain in another 9 months when the price drops to $250.","I've had the A95 for about 2 months now and I've been extremely pleased. It is one of those rare cameras that can serve as an excellent and simple point-and-shoot (for my wife) or can be used in such a way so as to satisfy people wanting more control over their photography (for me!). I have owned and used several digital cameras (mostly Nikon, Olympus, and Kodak) and I am continually awed by the amount of options that this camera allows you to mess with to get your perfect picture.<br /><br />A few comments on some of the many benefits of the A95:<br /><br />- Picture quality. This camera has great picture quality. What more can I say? I suppose there is some of that famed Canon \"purple-fringing\" but it is never really an issue for me and the kinds of pictures I generally take.<br /><br />- Vari-angle LCD. I was a little skeptical of the swivel \"Vari-angle\" LCD probably because I thought it would be flimsy or just be a hassle, but now I don't think I could ever own another camera that doesn't have it. It gives you so many options! You can just flip the LCD around to be used just like any other digital camera, or you can maneuver it to take perfectly-aimed photos from above your head, or holding it to your side, or to take a picture of yourself, or even to look around a corner ;). Even if you only use it to turn the LCD inward to protect the screen when you store the camera, this feature is worth the money.<br /><br />- Uses AA batteries. You can buy rechargable AAs and a charger, but you also have the freedom to not have to use expensive propritary batteries. Our batteries went dead while sight-seeing on vacation, so we just bought a pack of AAs at the first store we saw. It's hard to think of any store that doesn't sell AA batteries.<br /><br />- 5 MP. This camera is such a great value for a 5 megapixel camera. When I was shopping for a new camera, I figured I'd have to settle for 3 or 4 MPs for the price range I was looking for. My 8 x 10s look amazing!<br /><br />- Compact Flash Cards. This still seems to be one of the cheapest formats of flash storage media and it also seems to be the sturdiest. SD is smaller, but generally more expensive and flimsier. MS is proprietary to Sony so nobody else uses them. I'm able to use CF cards for many things other than just my camera so they are an even bigger value to me.<br /><br />- Fast startup and picture taking.<br /><br />- Well-written and easy-to-understand manual.<br /><br />Some relatively minor gripes:<br /><br />- It is rather large and heavy for a point-and-shoot camera. The weight doesn't bother me at all and I'm willing to sacrifice smaller size for more functions/control.<br /><br />- CF cover is flimsy and kind of tricky to close. You get the hang of it, but I still worry I'll accidentally break it one of these days. The camera won't operate if the CF door is open (although it seems you could easily \"trick\" the camera into thinking the door is closed). While I worry about this, I've yet to hear of anyone actually breaking it.<br /><br />- Battery cover is also a little awkward to close, but it's not flimsy where I think it'll break or anything.<br /><br />In short, this is a great all-around camera that offers you a lot of control over your pictures. In this price range, no other camera even comes close.","I decided the A95 was the best choice after looking seriously at Sony cameras and Fuji ones.  The prices may initially be similar, but Canon used Compact Flash, which is much cheaper than Sony's memory, Fuji's is even more than that...<br /><br />The camera is great, lots of MPs and great quality. One of my favorite features, simple as it may be, is the rotating LCD screen.  It makes picture taking a lot easier, and you can take pictures at angles you once couldn't (accuratly).<br /><br />The movie mode also worked surprisingly well, I didn't really expect much from that at all.  Another cool feature, perhaps useless, is that you can attach audio memos on pictures you like.<br /><br />Battery life is really good as well, much better than my last camera.<br /><br />The camera is good for lots of other reasons too... but I'm sure you've read most of them.<br /><br />All in all a great camera.  But if its too much, the A85 and A75 trade down only the MPs and the rotating LCD... but still good deals.","A perfect Gift for some one you adore.. I have given this gift to some one ..whom i can never forget","This camera is really good; First off it is fairly easy to use; and hand someone when you want someone else to take the picture. The display is really clear; the pictures come out in great quality.<br /><br />The zoom is good as well as the ability to swivel the screen for pics at any angle.The software is also good it installs what it needs and doesn't start any garbage @ boot up. It is also a good size not to small as to slipp out of your hands but not to big. (although it doesn't fit in a pocket)<br /><br />Overall it is a good camera that takes quality pictures.","Pros: Larger LCD screen with enhanced resolution, loads of manual/creative photography options, AA Batteries, terrific ergonimics, outstanding picture quality, versatile controls, Price vs. Features/Quality is unbeatable.<br /><br />Cons: Some minor chromatic aberration (purple fringing) and very high noise levels at ISO 400, no RAW mode, the camera eats batteries (with LCD use); included flashcard is too small for enthusiasts.<br /><br />Summary: The A95's 3X lens exhibits some minor barrel distortion at the wide-angle end of the zoom range, but no visible pincushion distortion at the telephoto end. There is also some noticeable chromatic aberration in high contrast color transition areas, but that is pretty much par for the course with all digicam zooms. My only real complaint with the A95 is the horrible noise levels at ISO 400, noticeably worse than the noise levels of the A80 at ISO 400. My friend says he's heard that the A95 has significant redeye problems, but we didn't shoot any portraits and only used the flash in fill mode so I can't address this issue. Basically, the A95 is a truly worthy successor to the nifty little A80. At this point in time, the A95 is an almost ideal digital camera, so if you've been searching a \"does it all\" general use five megapixel digital camera, the A95 is probably your best option.","You don't have to be a PROFESSIONAL to take great pictures.<br /><br />This camera has a lot of different modes for pictures (i.e. \"Special Scenes mode enables beginners to take pictures in Foliage, Snow, Beach, Fireworks, Night Snapshots, Indoors, & Underwater)--all of these enhance the quality of the picture. It has a great flippable LCD & an even better battery life. What I really love about this camera is that I can use rechargable batteries. Unlike other digitals it uses four AA (some may use lithium ion). Anyways, you don't have to spend a ton on batteries if you just invest in a recharger--the Panasonic BQ390 is the one I have and it is also great. Really the only thing I don't like is the flimsiness of the CF cover.","I purchased this camera as a Christmas present for my son. As an advanced amateur (I'd also done some pro wedding work 25 yrs ago) I'm pretty demanding about cameras. My son wanted a small shirt pocket camera to take along with him, but to me these are one-trick ponies that only frustrate you as you get familiar with pictures and want to do something beyond mere snapshots. That's where my son is at right now, so I wanted a camera that would do that well, and offer intermediate controls to grow into. Here's why I chose this camera:<br /><br />* Excellent size/feel of camera in hand. This is very important to me, that the controls and feel/weight of the camera is good. This had a good \"feel\" to it, and the controls are logically laid out and easy to find even without looking.<br /><br />* 5 megapixel translates to a good 11x14 photo, and the ability to crop and print large photos (5x7, 8x10)<br /><br />* Comprehensive range of automatic picture modes- including settings for beach, snow, foliage, underwater, indoor, night snapshot, fireworks, kids and pets- that you usually can't find on most cameras. Helpful for the beginner to get a good shot with minimum muss and fuss<br /><br />* Easy to find AA batteries. I bought a set of 2500 mAh NiMHs that should last longer than regular alkalines (which can be found in a pinch anywhere worldwide).<br /><br />* Swiveling LCD viewfinder. Great for taking pictures overhead or waist level, even self-portraits. The added benefit, you can turn the screen toward the body so it doesn't scratch when carried.<br /><br />* Intermediate controls allow you to to manual, aperture or shutter priority, and program in addition to the automatic. White balance can be customized for better color control (crucial if you can't shoot in RAW).<br /><br />* While start-up isn't particularly fast (2 sec), you can shoot continuously at 1.5-2 frames per second for as long as you have space on your card<br /><br />* 38-114 (35mm equivalent) good for most photos, although a 28 mm wide angle would be much better. Given the mild barrel distortion at 38mm though, I think compromises were made to keep this package affordable.<br /><br />* AF illuminator. This is crucial when focusing in low light situations, and is not available in all cameras.<br /><br />* Optional adapters for wide or telephoto, and filter capability. Again, an intermediate plus.<br /><br />Trade-offs:<br /><br />* Only USB 1.1, slow downloading from camera to computer (though easily remedied with 2.0 flash card reader<br /><br />* LCD only 1.8\". While bigger than the 1.5\" on the A80, even small cameras are now using 2\" or larger screens<br /><br />* No RAW or TIFF mode, but cameras that have that capability are not generally classified as beginner or 'point-and-shoot'.<br /><br />* Pictures noisy at higher ISO speeds. Not uncommon problem, and unless a photo is enlarged a lot, isn't generally noticeable. Isn't a problem for me because I use Photoshop with a noise reduction plug-in to edit pictures. Easy to show my son how to do that.<br /><br />* Lack of a flash shoe for a true flash unit. This shouldn't be a problem for most snapshots though, and a flash unit would be awkward on a camera this small.<br /><br />* Slow and short video (can't shoot 30 fps, time limited to 15-30 sec). I don't use it often, but it's nice to have.<br /><br />I didn't find the CF door troublesome like some people did. There is a definite way to open and shut it, and when it's done properly, it clicks into place easily. The build quality is excellent, and I think this camera will last a few years and give good service. It's a good value for the price. I hope my son agrees.","I have only had this camera for a week, but I have had the opportunity to shoot photos in many of the modes available. The photos are sharp with true colors. I have not noticed any purple fringing the the reviews speak of...at least yet. The camera feels solid to hold and feels very well made. The swivel display is sweet!! My old camera was a Kodak DX3900 which served me very well but the A95 is in a whole different class. I have a Canon ip4000 printer and the photos come out excellent. I paid $309 on Amazon, a great price for such a feature rich 5 MP camera.<br /><br />12/2011 Lets jump ahead 7 years !! This camera has continued to do very well even now that it is \"dwarfed\" by the new technology. One major kudos to Cannon: About 4 years ago, I noticed blue vertical streaking on photos taken of my son in snow. Very noticeable in the white areas. I called Canon to told me that this particular camera had known issues with its sensor. It was sent back to Canon and had the sensor replaced with an updated new sensor. The camera has been better than ever since.<br />This camera was more than 3+ years out of warranty and Canon stepped up to the plate.<br /><br />Just ordered a new Lumix LX-5 so this baby will be retired or given to one of my kids.","This is a great camera. i m extremely happy with its performance. Only one regret is that i ordered it thru dell. it took abt 19 days to recieve my packet. my word \" never order anything from dell or get things shipped from DHL\" they r the worst.<br /><br />Thanks","I recieved this camera four days ago and am completely happy for owning one. I purchased a Powershot ELPH 4.0 MP, which gave clear pictures, but returned it because it doesn't have all the 14 shooting modes the A95 model has. The PowerShot A95 gives me great clear, sharp picutures when it comes to enlargements (11X16). The ELPH 4.0 MP showed some blurrness whenever I printed 8X10 photos. In addition, the PowerShot ELPH 4.0 MP doesn't even compare to all the manual functions the A95 contains. All in all, I highly recommend the PowerShot A95 5.0 MP for its greats results in photo quality and is packed with great features.","I spent about an hour and a half last night debating between the Sony T1 5 MP and the Canon Power Shot A95.<br /><br />I'm sure my friend and I drove the poor sales clerk crazy - but he was very patient and we examined each extensively.<br /><br />I walked into the store primarily considering three cameras -- the Nikon CoolPix 5200, the Cybershot DSCP 100, and the Canon A95. Going in I'd done a lot of research and found the A95's reputation is outstanding. But Sony's general reputation -- and especially on the Cybershot DSCP 100 -- is outstanding too.<br /><br />The store was out of the Nikon, and since it had been the camera I was least impressed with after reading the reviews, I didn't worry about it too much. The DSCP 100 had all the right numbers and features, but didn't feel right to me for some reason. Maybe the shape threw me off? Honestly, I'm not sure. But the vibe wasn't right and so I asked to see the A95.<br /><br />By this time, the clerk and I had started chatting, and he pulled out the T1. Honestly, I had not come across the T1 in my research, so when the store clerk pulled out this little gem from behind the counter, I was blown away.<br /><br />The thing is tiny. And oh-so-beautiful. The LCD screen on the back is almost the same size as the screen on my Treo 600 -- on other words, huge. The camera felt great in my hands. And a Zeiss lens -- wow. That's top quality there. As soon as I touched it, I began lusting after this mystery camera. But was it any good?<br /><br />But let me digress. The A95 is solid. Just pure solid. Nice quality. Good build. Picture quality looks good. Screen is ... well, small -- especially compared to the T1. The A95 is physically a much larger camera -- though surprisingly, the weight felt about the same as the T1. Controls seemed intuitive and it's got lots of settings to play around with, but that don't get in the way of taking a simple snap shot.<br /><br />But the T1 has the sex appeal. So I kept going back to it. Without reviews, I was flying a little blind, but the fit and finish felt good. And, did I mention the sex appeal?<br /><br />But as I kept looking, practicality began creeping into the deliberations. For instance, the T1 uses a Sony-proprietary battery and memory system. The A95 uses AA batteries and SD memory.<br /><br />There's no way of easily protecting the T1's super-large (and super fragile) LCD screen. The A95's LCD flips around so that the screen is protected by the camera body.<br /><br />The T1 has no view finder and no way to take pictures if you aren't using the LCD. The A95 can be used with or without the LCD (which increases battery life).<br /><br />The T1 has a 3x optical zoom. The A95 has a 3x optical zoom, coupled with a digital zoom.<br /><br />The T1 has no tripod mount. The A95 does.<br /><br />\"Weighing\" in favor of the T1 are the A95's larger size, smaller screen, and the \"cool\" factor of the T1.<br /><br />As I played with both cameras (until the store just about closed), I noted a couple of other things about the T1 in the back of my mind. It wasn't until I read many of the reviews here that these perceptions began to crystallize.<br /><br />Holding the T1 steady is a major issue. (With the A95 I was able to take handheld low-light, no-flash pictures with minimal blurring.) The flash on the T1 was ho-hum. And despite the large LCD screen, telling which images were crisp and which were blurry was a major challenge with the T1. Really, the only way to tell would be to download the images to your computer before deciding which pictures are keepers and which are deleters.<br /><br />In the end, I listened to my wallet and my brain. I bought the A95. I needed reliability and quality more than glamour and glitz. The SD storage cards are about half the price as the Sony cards -- and that issue of the proprietary batteries is a big one.<br /><br />So far so good -- picture quality on the A95 looks good, although I can tell that I'm going to have to learn to use the different \"scene\" settings in order to get the best out of the camera. Even so, the A95 is easy to use. (It even fit perfectly in a cheap generic camera case!) I'll have to post again as I get to know my new camera better.<br /><br />Hopefully you'll find this review of use. In the end -- both cameras are keepers in my opinion. Which one you pick is probably more a matter of personal preference than anything else. Good luck to everyone in picking out the right camera!","This Camera is really great product, which for the price is a really good value for money.<br /><br />What I Like:<br /><br />+ Picture Quality<br /><br />+ Software bundle<br /><br />+ Easy to use<br /><br />+ Lot of Manual and automatic controls<br /><br />+ Uses standard AA Batteries<br /><br />+ Swirl LCD Screen<br /><br />+ Portable size, solid feel<br /><br />Could be improved by Canon:<br /><br />~ Higher MB CF Card with the package<br /><br />~ Rechargable Batteries & Charger<br /><br />~ Case","I bought this camera for a trip to Yosemite, and it didn't disappoint. This is my second digital camera - my first was an Olympus 2MP that I've had for a few years. The Canon blows it away in features and picture quality.<br /><br />I like the size of the camera - it's easy to carry and store (like in my wife's handbag), without being too heavy or bulky. I had considered an ELF, but I didn't want the compromises that the sub-compacts make in features and useability. I had also considered a digital SLR, but that would have precluded the use of the wife's handbag as a storage container. I also thought the SLR's were overkill for someone who's a fairly casual amateur photographer. Don't get me wrong, I've been taking pictures for over 40 years and have used some very sophisticated equipment. But, these days, I want something easy to carry and easy to use. If you're serious about photography, by all means go for the big guns.<br /><br />I won't go into a littany of the Canon A95's features, since others have done a good job of that. Suffice it to say that, except for real photo enthusiasts and professionals, this camera has everything you'll ever need, and more.<br /><br />I took about 200 pictures and a few movies, and viewed them both digitally and in print (Ofoto). They are, almost without exception, excellent. Being new to the camera, and having forgotten the manual while I was on vacation, I didn't come close to using all of its features. I used the built-in scene modes extensively (easily accessible using the rotating wheel that surrounds the shutter button - nicer than having to navigate menus), and they worked as advertised. Some of the scenery shots of Yosemite are really spectacular, rivaling some of the professional shots I've seen for sale (if I do say so myself).  I've blown some of them up to 8x10 and printed them myself, and the resolution is more than adequate. I'm sure I could go up to 11x14 or 16x20 and still get excellent prints (if I only had a printer that could do that - it's on my wish list). I especially liked the panoramic mode - after you take a shot, the previous picture is displayed immediately beside the shot you're lining up, letting you line up the shots almost perfectly. I printed a panorama that I took from one of the Yosemite overlooks on 3 8x10 sheets and it blew me away.<br /><br />Boot-up time is very quick, and the shutter delay wasn't at all offensive. Like most point-and-shoots, you have to hold the shutter button down 1/2 way to get it to set focus and exposure, but once you do that, the camera takes the picture quickly. The delay while the camera stores the image to the memory card is also not excessive (tha camera displays \"busy\" on the LCD while it's doing that).<br /><br />Battery life was excellent. I've been using the I-C3 15-minute rechargable batteries with great results (Amazon carries the Ray-O-Vac batteries and charger, they're also available elsewhere in those electronic shops you find in malls and shopping centers).<br /><br />The swivel LCD is a great feature. I agree with others that talk about it being a little hard to see in brightly lit areas. Of course, you can always use the viewfinder.<br /><br />You'll definitely need a bigger memory card - I bought a 1GB, which seems to hold about 700 pictures at the default resolution. The price of CF cards of this capacity has recently dropped, so I'd highly recommend one or two of these. I didn't change the camera to the super-fine mode, so I don't know what effect that has on capacity. I was able to take all the shots I wanted, as well as some 10-30 second movies and I still had plenty of memory left.<br /><br />My only other minor complaint (other than the LCD visibility problem), is that the maximum optical zoom range is only 3x. If you use the digital zoom, you can go up to 12x, but you lose resolution. Take this into consideration if you need a high-powered zoom. The camera does have interchageable lenses, so that's one way to overcome this limitation (I haven't priced any of the other lens options).<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this camera.","After doing a lot of research I choose the Canon A95.  This is the first digital camera I've owned, although I've used other digital cameras in the past.  It was purchased for a three-week trip through France and Italy.  I used two different memory cards during the trip to take roughly 800 shots.  The first card was a 1GB Viking, the second a SanDisk UltraII 1 GB.  There was no noticeable difference between the two cards, although I never did a specific comparison.<br /><br />Camera Pros:<br /><br />*The rotating LCD view finder is great.  I used the view finder again and again to get shots at odd angles.  I would hold the camera over my head with the view find angled down to see the shot.  Same thing, holding the camera out through a fence to get a shot looking down.  The view finder also worked great to get shots of my wife and myself by holding the camera at arms length.  My only complaint with the view finder is that in bright light, not just direct sunlight, it became difficult to see the image.<br /><br />*AA batteries - this was important for us.  We didn't want a special lithium battery that would be impossible to find out on the road.  We purchased Kodak 2100 mAh NiMH batteries with the camera.  The camera takes four batteries, so we got eight.  I can't tell you exactly how long the camera operates on these batteries, but it's a while.  We took at least 1200 photos, reviewing and deleting bad ones each night.  During 23 days on the road, I went through three sets of batteries, plus an hour on a fourth set.  I was happy with the performance.<br /><br />*Size - we wanted a camera that was small enough to easily carry, but not so small that it was difficult to hold.  Both my wife and I (with very different hand sizes) were happy with the feel of the camera.  My wife didn't care for the location of the on/off button, as she frequently accidently hit it, but I didn't have any problems.<br /><br />*Menu/interface - I see lots of complains about how difficult cameras can be to operated.  I thought the Canon interface was fairly intuitive and easy to use.  Of course, I also read the user guide on the airplane, so I'm sure that helped.<br /><br />*Picture quality (during the day) - most of the pictures I took duing the day look good.  I have not printed any of the images yet, the digital images look great.  Color reproduction looks good and the detail with the 5mp is great.  I'll be having a bunch of images printed shortly, including some larger 8x10's.  If there's a problem with the image quality, I'll post it.<br /><br />Here are a couple cons:<br /><br />*Viewing the LCD in bright light (not just direct sunlight, but any direct light)<br /><br />*Speed - I know this is a general disadvantage of digital cameras of this type and I can't make a direct comparison to other cameras, but after using a standard 35mm film camera, it seemed like capturing a shot took a long time with the camera.<br /><br />*Night shots are very difficult to get without a tripod or stationary object to rest the camera on.  A lot of churches and museums don't allow flash.  We took a lot of blurry, low light pictures. Whenever possible, I set the camera on something to take the shot, but it's not always possible.  Without a direct comparison to another camera, I can't say if the A95 is better or worse than others.<br /><br />*By default, the camera is set to large rather than superfine resolution.  I changed the setting on the camera to superfine right away, knowing that I had plenty of CF memory.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize (even though I ready the manual) that you need to change the resolution setting in each shooting mood independently, so I ended up taking a bunch of pictures in less than the best resolution setting accidently.<br /><br />*Part way through the trip, the camera reset itself to all default settings.  I don't we did anything to reset it, and we weren't changing batteries when it happened.  It only did it once, but it was kind of a pain since I needed to go back through and turn the sound, resolution, and other options back to the way I liked them.<br /><br />*No raw or TIFF capture.  I knew this when I bought the camera, but it would be nice to have under certain circumstances.<br /><br />Overall, I was very happy with the performance of this camera during the first month of use.","We just got these cameras in the store and they are amazing. Everyone enjoys the LCD screen on the back. Instead of the typical fixed LCD it has a swivel one much like your Camcorder. It pops out so you can have it hang to the side, or you can flip it over to take pictures of yourself and your family if you don't have a cameraman handy. It can also flip back into the body to function just like previous LCD screens. Amazing innovation in digital camera's. Overall nice camera from Canon.","The A95 is a great value and performer for the person who is looking for a feature rich, relatively compact 5mp camera, that accepts standard AA batteries, and takes great pictures.  Since it accepts standard AA's, there are no rechargeable batteries or charger included; only 4 alkalines.<br /><br />I also own a Canon s60, and in side by side tests, the A95 slightly underperforms it, but is still great nonetheless.<br /><br />Given the choice between the s60 & the A95, I would probably go with the s60 (or now the s70).  However, when you factor in cost, the A95 is a winner, and that is why I still gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />The only real \"cons\" I have with the camera are the usual Canon complaints everyone has that the compactflash and battery access door is flimsy and cheap.  This is the case with the A95 more than with the s-series Canon cameras.  Since the A95 takes AAs, the battery door is under tension when you try and close it, and the trick is to use two fingers and press the door down evenly. If you do this, it works flawlessly.  If you don't, you will not be able to slide the door into the closed position due to the fact the door itself will deflect under pressure and prevent the catch from fully inserting into the track it rides in when closing.  Also, if you plan on frequently removing the compactflash card to download images, instead of using the USB, then you may want to consider a different camera.  The compactflash door on the A95 is really difficult to open, and feels like you might break it off when it does open. This is probably more of a \"feel\" than anything else.<br /><br />All in all, the A95 is a great camera for the price.","I purchased this camera- my first digital- not knowing what to expect. I am impressed by the fact that the screen can be turned to face you or to the one being photographed, and it can be turned in towards the camera itself, keeping it from being scratched. The features are awesome, and the photo  quality- printed photos on plain everyday paper, and they were just incredible. My daughter's Sony doesn't even come close to this one! This is an amazing camera! I recommend it to anyone looking - a first time user, or someone replacing one.","The A95 is an EXCELLENT follow up to the A80, and offers some very nice improvements.  The most noticeable is the jump to 5 megapixels at $100 lower MSRP than the A80 when it came out!  Then there is the larger rotating LCD that is now useable in low light, scene modes for those who don't like to tinker with the settings, and the print/share button to make things easier.  For those who don't know, scene modes are easy-to-access presets of a combination of manual adjustments, optimized for shooting in different situations such as when you are indoors, at the beach, taking shots of kids, shooting at night, or shooting fireworks, etc.  There is also the addition of the Flexi-Zone feature, which lets you choose one of the 9 autofocus spots, so you can focus on non-centered objects!  This is usually a feature only found on much higher priced cameras.  The camera features full manual controls over shutter speed and aperture, manual focus, saturation, exposure compensation, custom white balance, ISO, metering, and a histogram in playback mode.  I know most people think they won't ever use some of these, but when you have an important shot that just isn't coming out, you'll be really glad you have it (or wish you did).  For those who don't know, control over shutter speed means you can use a fast shutter speed to capture fast action or you can use a slow shutter to avoid using a flash or for taking shots of night scenery like a city-scape.<br /><br />The areas where the Canon A75, A85, and A95 really excel at are:<br /><br />Being fairly small(small price tag too!) for a camera with this many features and having picture quality this good.<br /><br />Creative shooting:  this is a great camera for those who want to do creative shooting but can't afford to plop down $600+ for a Canon G6 or more for a Digital SLR.  It's got all of the most important controls, and with your memory card, you can do all the creative shooting and experimenting you want virtually free compared to using film.  It's even expandable with telephoto, wide angle, or close up conversion lenses and there's also the waterproof casing.  One other plus is the flip-out rotating LCD screen, which is VERY useful when your camera is on a tripod, is low to the ground, or when the camera is pointed up but below shoulder height, because you can simply flip the LCD screen to the proper viewing position instead of getting down behind the camera.  You can also use it to shoot over peoples' heads and use it to get a preview when you are doing self portraits.<br /><br />All Canon cameras also come with an excellent software package that lets you stitch panoramic photos, retouch photos or rescue those that came out wrong, add special effect, and view thumbnails of pictures so you don't have to open them up to see what the picture looks like (good for those who are using an older version of windows, I know there are still a lot of you out there).  The best part is that it's free!  It does more than Kodak's software(which is pretty decent), you have to pay $20 to get the better version of Olympus's software, and Sony's editing software is pretty much non-existent.  Those who already have Photoshop won't be excited.<br /><br />For those of you who are concerned that the camera doesn't come with rechargeable batteries, don't worry, it's really not a big deal.  Good rechargeable AA's, type NiMH are super cheap at around $10-$15 for 4, compared to $50 for Lithium Ion battery packs, and at that price, everyone can afford a spare set, which is really important to have.  I've seen people who bought much crappier cameras at the same price, just because they came with rechargeable batteries - not a smart choice in my opinion.<br /><br />Yes, there is the problem with purple fringing, but it's not a very common problem and most people either don't know what it is or don't even know think it's much of a problem when they see it.  Some people think it looks cool.  With full control over aperture, you have the ability to get rid of it or at least reduce it.  Compared to the problems that other manufacturers have with their cameras, I'd take a bit of purple fringing over noise, soft/fuzzy images, and over-sharpening any day!<br /><br />If you are looking to spend much less but want to get pretty much the same camera at 4 megapixels, check out the Canon Powershot A85 or the 3 megapixel A75.  you lose the rotating LCD though.","If someone wants to buy a compact digital camera, most of the times it's enough to choose from Canon models.<br />Canon offers different types of cameras to different people needs.<br />Let's take a look at them if you don't mind, I will try to give a helping hand for those who just cannot decide.<br /><br />Basically there are six line of Canon compacts:<br />1.<br />The G-series - Pros: fast lens, 4x optical zoom, all manual controls, flip-out LCD, hot shoe, optional converters, RAW mode, microdrive support, long battery life (despite of the lithium type!), professional feeling, great hand-grip<br />Cons: weighty, big size, lithium batteries (from a point of view), pricey<br />2.<br />The Sxx-series - Pros: wider angle then average (28mm to S60/S70), portability, light, RAW mode, microdrive support, full manual controls, elegant look<br />Cons: fixed LCD, slow lens, PF (CA), lithium battery<br />3.<br />The Sxxx-series - Pros: portability (small size), very light, sexy look<br />Cons: fixed LCD, slow lens, PF (CA), lithium battery, lack of real manual controls<br />4.<br />The Axx-series - Pros: long battery life (due to AA's), flip-out LCD, great hand-grip, full manual controls, optional converters, many scene modes for beginners (on A70 and now on A95), cheap<br />Cons: slow lens, PF (CA)<br />5.<br />The Axxx-series - Pros: cheap, uses AA's, portability<br />Cons: slow lens, PF (CA), no real manual controls<br />6.<br />The NEW Sx-IS series - Pros: big zoom, best video, great hand-grip, long battery life (due to AA's), full manual controls<br />Cons: weighty, slow lens, PF (CA), lack of AF-assist lamp, noisy images<br /><br />That's it, at least at the date of this quick review.<br />As you can see from the above<br />- The G-series has the fastest lens and a hot shoe<br />- The Sxx-series has the wider angle zoom (28mm to 100mm)<br />- The Sxxx-series are the more portable ones<br />- The Axx-series has the best value for it's price<br />- The Axxx-series are the cheapest ones that are also very portable<br />- The Sx-IS-series has the biggest zoom and the best video to date<br /><br />All of them - except for the G-series - suffer from purple fringing. The G-series has them also, but not much.<br />All of them has more shutter lag, compared to competition (new Sony and Fuji models).<br />But pls don't forget the high detail in the images that only CANON compacts can bring. A very important issue for me.<br /><br />First, it's a question of money.<br />Second, it's a question of needs.<br />Lastly, it's a question of taste.<br /><br />How much can you afford?<br />What are the most important things you need?<br />What shape/size do you prefer?<br /><br />My suggestion is: decide what are the things FOR YOU that are important when choosing a cam. The decision lies beneath your NEEDS:<br /><br />- Need big zoom or best video? Get an Sx-IS cam.<br />- Need portability? Get an Sxxx-series cam.<br />- Need fast lens, a hot shoe and RAW? Get a G-series.<br />- Need wider angle zoom or RAW? Get an Sxx-series cam.<br />- Do you want to print in big size? Get the highest MP one<br />- You are on the budget? Get an Axxx-series cam.<br /><br />None of the above? Get an Axx-series camera then!<br /><br />The top of the A-line cameras now is the A95 that is a geat, but not perfect cam. There are no perfect ones. Every of them has it's flaws. Pls don't be a maximalist otherwise you won't enjoy the beauty of your own cam. Choose the right cam for you based on your needs. An IMPORTANT advie: don't let the megapixel drive you if you don't need big size prints. It's only marketing, more megapixels doesn't mean better image quality. Keep this in mind always!<br /><br />So I got the A95.<br />I love the LCD, the battery life, full manual controls, shape, hand-grip and the optional converters of the A95.<br />I miss the fast lens, the wider angle and the hot shoe.<br />Weight could be less, but it's quite tolerable and the camera is portable enough for me, if there is a belt-case with you then you won't miss the IXUS. Bigger than the Sxxx-series but much smaller than the G-series. I had an IXUS before (S400) but missed the manual controls and the flip-out LCD, so I had to change.<br /><br />I had an A80 before. The difference is not that much. The A95 has 5 megapixels and a bigger LCD with higher resolution. These are the main differences. They are not much, but enough for me to change, I am one of those people who don't think just buy. :) Do you have an A80? Wait for the next model. Do you have an A60/A70/A75/A85 model? Buy this! That flip-out LCD is a bless.<br />It has a bit more noise - probably due to the more megapixel - than the A80. BUT: it has nicer LCD and a bit faster response times. I don't know why because normally it should be slower because of the bigger file sizes (5mp vs 4mp on the A80). But it's not. It's quicker, but not much. Still, another plus for the A95.<br />The Flexi-zone feature is very useful, ususally found only on higher end cameras. It let's you choose the focus point anywhere in the frame, though I use mine with Center Focus AF most of the time.<br />The extra scene modes are great, I just don't use them so often. I don't like when the camera sets the ISO above 50 when there is no need to.<br />The VGA video is quite useless since it records only 30 secs. What a shame, I really miss that unlimited video! But it's not a deal breaker for me, since it's a camera not a camcorder.<br />The print/share button is not that exciting - at least for me. I know I will never use it.<br /><br />All in all: a great cam. Such as Canon's other models. All of them are great, I started with an A40 and loved that much, that was my first cam. The A95 is the close-to-perfect family cam, I highly recommend it to everyone. It's image quality is top-notch in many ways, it only has a bit higher than average PF that's all, otherwise it takes excellent images out of the cam without any post-processing.<br /><br />Buy it, it's a CANON.","I have a Canon SLR and I decided to get my wife a Digital Camera so that we will have a choice. I decided to go with Canon Powershot A95 because of the vast features it provides. Its like a small SLR camera! Last year I saw my friend's A80 and fell in love with it. Although I found a bit shutter lag in A80, A95 was quite ok. The features were very easy to understand and the setup was too. I love the moving LCD although its a bit small. But hey you can take your own pictures without asking anyone to do that for you. I had a bit problem in taking pictures at start. Was finding it hard to focus and the pictures were coming a bit blury. But after some time I got used to the half press to focus and full press to take picture. Its not that good as my SLR though.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Big enough to not get lost, Small enough to fit in my wifes purse.<br /><br />2. Love the moving LCD, although its a bit small.<br /><br />3. Pictures are really good once you learn how to focus and use the features of the camera.<br /><br />4. AA batteries, easy to find anywhere in world. Althougn canon should have packed rechargable batteries/charger with it.<br /><br />5. So many shooting modes. One for every ocassion.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Purple fringing on some pictures. Especially if you take pictures of white objects.<br /><br />2. 32MB CF is too small. Need to get a bigger capacity CF card. I had to buy a 512MB CF.<br /><br />3. The CF Card door is loose, flimsy.<br /><br />4. Canon should have switched the places of the A/V output and USB output. We use USB to connect to the computer a lot."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S70","amazon_reviews":["The camera arrived in great condition.  It works very well.

The quality of photos and the ease of use were impressive then and again now.<br />The size is right, even if it's a little heavy than the new ones now, and the fact that the battery can last for days ( or 400 photos) is fabulous! I had a Nikon that sucked batteries like breath mints.<br />I didn't buy the camera on Amazon as planned, since the seller neglected to state that the view screen was defective. I cancelled my ordfer and bought it elsewhere. All's well that ends well.","It was a descent camera at the time. I bought it in 2005 for about $390 something from BuyDig(finally a place that gave me no hassle, or the ussual run around.)<br />With wide angle lens, sliding lens cover. But here's what I learned: The slider is flimsy, and comes off of it's sliding rails sometimes, it doesn't do too well in low light. Forget about trying to take a candle lit shot of an altar. I ended up taping a piece of tissue to compensate for the overly bright flash. Above 100iso setting things tend to get rather grainy. This is a very sensitive and finicky camera to work with, you can have it on a setting that you like and as soon as you close the clam shell your setting disappears, and you're back to the default settings that may or may not work for you. Also the mode dial moves too easily, so you gotta be careful when you pull it out of your bag.<br /><br />So save yourself the money. Because if you were to look on current market for point & Shoot digi cam, you'll find other cameras that are (1)cheaper, with (2)higher mega pixel counts, (3)Built in image stabilization/vibration reduction etc. (4)Slimmer body(so you don't look like you're overly excited, or have a pet gerbil hiding in your pants)<br /><br />Finally, if you've been shooting film SLR you probably won't be satisfied with most digicam unless you're getting Nikon D3, or Canon EOS-1Ds MkIII.<br />Because unlike film cameras, the processor in those little digicam decides almost everything if it doesn't live up to standards you're stuck! ...with grainy, unnaturally color balanced images.","Nothing to complain, except slightly heavy and bulky (not too much though). Compare to my old S30, the battery life is greatly improved, and the turn-on time is shorter too. Picture quality and functions are also very good. Really love it. And its control is quite user friendly.","I have owned this camera since it came out on the market.  I have used many different digital cameras - and I believe this one has been the most user friendly and produces very fine images.  It is well constructed- I take mostly outdoor/nature photos and having traveled extensively with this camera it has held up remarkably well.<br /><br />I spent over 8 months in one year on fishing boats in the Bering Sea...no problems.  This camera captured thousands of images (intervolometer option - awesome!) inside it's waterproof housing while strapped to the steel gantry's of 100' ships in less than ideal weather...no problem.<br /><br />This camera went with me to the top of Ecuador's highest volcanos...only problem was the LCD freezing - now there are a few 'spots' on it...but hey...that was my fault and it wasn't exactly warm up there at 20,000'<br /><br />So, yeah...it's a nice tuff little camera.<br /><br />If you want to see some of my images from AK, check out - [...]<br />you'll need to click on each underlined link...and of course the image size has been reduced to save space....<br /><br />Check it out!","A friend at work was just asking for advice on a camera as she had an early digital compact that was very un-user friendly.  The conversation inspired me to post a review as this camera is so easy to use and takes fantastic photos.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Easy to use<br /><br />- Picture quality is great<br /><br />- Video is pretty good (not amazing but better than most out there)<br /><br />- Size is good - not tiny but not big for the quality you get<br /><br />- Stylish; looks nice<br /><br />- You can buy a waterproof casing for it<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The only thing that is probably the case with all compacts is its not super fast taking a photo.  If you have used an SLR this will be a little annoying but overall its not a great problem and something you get used to with automatic focus.<br /><br />I've been very very happy with this camera using it for travel and family shots.  Thumbs up.","Love this digital camera compared to our previous ones. We're mostly a point-and-click family, and this is an easy-to-use camera that does a good point-and-click and gives an opportunity to do more if you should so choose some day.","I purchased the S70 10 months ago and travelled with it throughout southeast Asia through harsh climate conditions and rough roads. The camera was flawless! The camera \"build\" is fabulous and the camera can be quite simple to operate even though it has many features found in digital SLRs. Two features that I like most are: 1) the panaorama feature in combination with the Zoom Browser software that can produce breathtaking super wide angle panoramic images and 2) the capability of shooting/storing images in RAW format for those special occassions when you know you are going to want to print the image in highest quality (its successor the S80 does nothave the RAW image feature). This is a very high quality camera and if you don't want the bulk of the digital SLRs on the market but want very high quality images----this is the camera!! This camera turned me into a Canon fan!<br /><br />I recommend at least a 1 gig memory card and one extra battery. At the highest resolution I was getting at least 350 images on a 1 gig card. I also recommend the LowePro case that is compatible with the S70 like the Rezo series pouches Very protective and holds extra batteries and memory cards.","I bought this Camera in October of 2004- when the product was first released. I have had zero problems with it, and have nothing but the best things to say about it's photo capabilities.<br /><br />I think that this is the best balance of quality for the price. Besides, you don't need more than 7.1 mp for any photography. If I shot photos in the full 7.1 mp I could make life size posters!<br /><br />The true test for this camera (to me) was when I went on vacation up the California coast. I shot the most amazing pictures in Big Sur. The detail was exquisite, and the color was amazing. Since I have purchased this camera, my PhotoShop days have been over. I never have to adjust the color of any shot I take, and that is why I love this camera so much.<br /><br />If you are looking for a camera that has the capabilities of an SLR without the size of an SLR, this is definitely the one to get.","The canon powershot s70 is in my opinion the best point and shoot camera you can buy for the money.  It has all the shooting modes that an SLR camera would have but in a slim compact design.  Set the dial to the preset settings for different situations or tweak the more professional dial choices to get that perfect shot.  Though if you are not on the up and up with digital cameras these settings may seem a bit overwhelming.  With 7.1MP your pictures will come out extremely clear.  Most point and shoot cameras only have 3x optical zoom, but this baby has 3.6x optical zoom.  Though sometimes this doesn't get as close as one would want.  Add-on's are easy to find at any store that carries the camera.  I haven't had any need for an extra battery but I would recommend getting a 512MB compact flash II for even betting images.  If you are thinking you need a camera that has a substantial zoom then I would not suggest buying the telephoto lens that can be bought as an accessory.  If you want close up images you have to take the lens off then put it back on for the zoom feature.  Over all, this camera is great for the everyday use for those who want all of the features of the professional SLR digital cameras.  I would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new digital camera.","This is a review that I could not wait to write. Even a few years later I agree, though things in the industry have changed. You simply can't go wrong if you're considering buying this incredibly intelligent and powerful camera-the Canon PowerShot S70 7.1MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Optical Zoom. With so many brands on the market and so many choices, where does one begin to find the right camera for their personal  and professional needs? Where does a photographer or the average enthusiast start to isolate the camera that they want to buy for themselves or as a gift?<br /><br />I really do hope that this personal and honest review will help you narrow your search and help you develop more faith in what you're buying. I'm assuming that you probably have a good deal of experience with photography or you're a person that appreciates great photography. So if you're looking for an outstanding digital camera at a Professional Level, you've found it with this monumental digital camera from Canon. This is a VERY dependable camera, probably in the top of the all the reviews I looked at while doing my homework. If you're a photographer, you know how great it feels to put a great machine in your hands. The Canon Powershot S70 is as sturdy and comfortable as they make them!<br /><br />This camera will always take color-rich and vivid photos for you-even if you make a slight mistake or move your hands just a tiny bit when photographing. It actually has a great deal of technology that is built-in and designed to compensate for anyone who might be in a poor lighting situation or someone who forgets to focus well before shooting the picture. I typically use the function that allows the camera to call all the shots. At first I wasn't comfortable in doing that. After I took my first 2 rolls to the camera store for developing, I soon discovered that I had nothing to worry about and I was dealing with a superb camera.<br /><br />Canon Powershot Digital Cameras are pretty hard to compare with others in the this arena. I've had Powershots for a long time and I've taken over five thousand photos with them-they stand up against my accidental drops or drops of rain when I've exposed the camera to water.<br /><br />Aside for requiring powerful batteries that use a good amount of power, there is no downside to this incredible digital camera from a great digital camera maker. I've been able to have these photographs enlarged to poster size and found them to be as vivid (even close up) as I could ever have imagined. With 7.1 Megapixels, sizes like 8x10's are not even a concern when enlarging.<br /><br />Canon was in the camera business decades before digital cameras were even on the market and they've really pushed the digital envelope with this camera. If you're looking for a gift for someone who is an avid photographer and like digital photography, you've found it in the Powershot S70. You can stop looking and place your order now. Your recipient will be extrememly satisfied with the ease of use and the high quality of this great camera.<br /><br />If you are an avid photographer, like myself, and wish to have a camera for digital shots-this is the baby you'll want to buy! If you're looking to take photographs that you will likely enlarge to 5x7's, 8x10's or larger, this camera has enough power and technology to do the job without looking like a digital photograph. Often my framed digital prints look better than my photographs taken with film-something I never thought would happen!<br /><br />There is a great deal of information that you can read about this camera on the Canon website and other review sites online. You can compare the camera with others in the same category. You might find some slightly better deals with other brands that might offer even larger amounts of Megapixels. That really is NOT what you should be looking for. Often the number of Megapixels is only possible with the use of special software to inerpolate the photographs. You don't want to have to worry about all of that. You are set with the Canon that truly delivers 7.1 VIVID Megapixels!<br /><br />Canon puts together an entire Kit or Package when you buy the Digital Powershot. I wanted to also let you know that the software that's included with the camera package is fantastic and is literally worth the price of the camera in itself. However, you're getting a super package with this deal and a camera that can depend on for as long as you want to own the camera. I've exposed it mine to rain about 10 different times, and I've not EVER had any even a small incidental problem. reminds me of the Energizer Bunny-It just keeps on Going and Going and Going and never stops! You will NOT be disappointed with your purchase and with the warranty from Canon.<br /><br />I hope that this honest review was of some help to you as it was a pleasure to write it for you.","I received the merchandise in excellent condition, new, on time. Everything as promised. Thank you.","I'm very satisfied with the quality of the photos, its compactness, and its functionality. I used a 2MP s60 for quite some time, so this is a nice upgrade. Battery life has been good. My only complaints are that the display is hard to view in bright sunlight, and the lens cover slides off easily when placed in a pocket.","The s70 is a good all around camera for the secrete paparazzi in you.  At its highest resolution you get amazing detail in the pictures.  The digital zoom does make the picture a little grainy, which is a bummer.  This is one camera where you need to read the manual if you want to take advantage of all of its features.  I was a little disappointed in the TV viewing of my pictures.  Perhaps it is my TV but the images are black and white.<br /><br />With this camera you really must upgrade your flash RAM to 2GB.  You can pick it up from [...] for about $100.  The high rez pics are very large.  I also bought the lens adapter and the tele-lens.  Haven't received them yet so I can't let you know how they work.<br /><br />Over all rating of this camera is good.  With the other accessories; tripod (large and pocket size), 2GB memory, lens adapter, lens, remote control, and spare battery this setup is great for the dad looking for a camera to capture the family moments in life.","I've owned more than a dozen cameras since i first caught the photography bug thirty years ago, but the S70 is by far my favorite (so far!).<br /><br />I could go on and on about the amazing range of features packed into the S70's compact, sturdy little body (and i must admit that both the features and the design are impressive!). But what impresses me most about this camera is the consistently excellent images it produces.<br /><br />The optics are superb; they are quick to focus and produce razor-sharp photos.  The metering, too, is excellent, even in high-contrast situations. And the color fidelity is among the best i've ever seen in a digital camera, at any price.<br /><br />This camera also boasts a true wide-angle lens, which is great if you photograph landscapes or architecture. And at a whim, the S70 can be a fully automated \"point and shoot\" or the next-best-thing to a fully manual SLR. I also love the thick plastic cover over the LED screen on the back!<br /><br />The flash is perhaps a bit underpowered, which can contribute to the \"red eye\" some other reviewers complained about. I've noticed this to be a problem only in very low light, though, and it's my only complaint (and a minor one, at that!).<br /><br />If you're looking for a rugged, reliable compact digital camera that consistently captures great images, look no further than the S70.","First of all, I am not a serious camera buff. The S70 is my first digital camera because I wanted to wait until the technology was proven before I jumped in. That said, the S70 has proven to be a great camera that takes great pictures.<br /><br />The only problem I have noticed is that the autofocus has a hard time resolving anything without sharp edges. When I was at the Smithsonian a couple of weeks ago taking pictures of some impresssionist paintings they gave the autofocus headaches.<br /><br />My bud is a camera freak. He just bought a $5000 12 MP Nikon to add to his collection of high dollar Nikons. I would ask him what such and such function does and, after explaining it to me, he would be surprised that a pocket camera would offer that feature. For example, for an important picture that might not be able to be shot twice, it has settings that will tap out three photos-one regularly exposed, one underexposed, and one overexposed.<br /><br />He was one to snub his nose at small point and shoot cameras but, being a cameraphile, he cant resist playing around with mine when thats all there is. Over the past few weeks of playing around with it the S70 has earned his respect. He was impressed enough with enough that he recommended it to another acquaintance that asked him for his opinon.<br /><br />UPDATE. I have had the S70 for several months now and have nothing to say about it but good things. I carry it around almost everywhere I go. Like any unashamed amateur, most of the pics I take are junk. Like any digital camera, a view screen and the delete button take care of most of that. Occasionally though, the S70 has surprised me. On more than one occasion people in varying degrees of separation have come across some of the S70 pics and pulled out money for enlarged copies of them. I'm under no illusions of grandeur, most of the subjects are lonely windmills or other icons of rural Texas, and the amounts involved won't pay any bills, but the fact that it happens at all is new to me. I uploaded to the customer pics section one of several S70 photos, taken on a whim, now enlarged to 16x20 and hanging in a local Fraternal Order of Police office (paid for with their $$).<br /><br />Now the S70 is obviously not a pro camera. I haven't seen nor heard of any Time or National Geographic correspondents dashing through rainforests or dodging bullets in Iraq with one. But is has, unexpectedly, made me look more competent than I have any right to claim to be. The fact that something like that happens at all is testament to the capabilities of the S70.","I've been watching the canon S series since the S20, so when our film camera (a Canon) died after 10 years, I just bought the S70. This is the single best camera we've ever owned.<br /><br />Where do I begin? 7 megapixels means even a partial frame prints without pixelation. I don't know what purple fringing is, we don't see any pruple fringes in our photos.<br /><br />We bought a 512 MB card, which has a capacity of 160 photos at the highest resolution, minimum-compression JPEG setting. The quality is truly outstanding.<br /><br />Sure, I wish the shutter lag was shorter, but it's as good as any digital camera I've tried. Full recharge of the battery takes less than two hours, and the battery lasts for over 100 shots (I haven't needed any more than that.)<br /><br />Did I say we love this camera?<br /><br />We do photo cards every Christmas. This year, I bought the camera in November, and the first weekend we owned it, I took an amazing photo of our daugher. Even though the best part of the photo just occupied 25% of the frame, it looked great after cropping. Within 30 minutes, I'd uploaded the photo to Ophoto, and two days later we received the highest quality photo cards we've ever seen.<br /><br />Did I mention that I love this camera?<br /><br />Hint: Get to know all the photo modes on the main dial. They give you an amazing range of control over your images.","There's no doubt about it, the S70 is a great camera. Its small enough to carry with you (though a little too big for pockets), has a nice LCD and boasts amazing 7.1MP resolution. You can print out an 11x14 poster of your photo without having to stretch the image, that's how great 7.1MP really is. Also, its got tons of features for a non-SLR model that are easy to use for camera beginners.","After getting my S70, I splurged on a few accessories.  Here is a review on how well they work with the S70.<br /><br />- CF card, at least 1GB in size:  This is a no-brainer must have.  Get a high speed one (but note that Lexar's \"Write Acceleration\" is not supported on Canon cameras).<br /><br />- Canon wide angle lens, and the required lens adaptor:  Not worth it.  The lens doesn't sit very stably on the camera (I expected a more solid feel when using genuine Canon accessories on a Canon camera), and the pictures taken are somewhat distorted.<br /><br />- Wireless controller:  If you have a decent tripod (any brand will do, the S70 accepts a regular tripod screw) and want to be in the pictures you take without resorting to Photoshop, the remote control is a nice thing to have.  But don't expect too much, the zooming control on the remote is pretty much a joke.<br /><br />- Portable dye sublimation printer:  These are marvelous and produce absolutely real-looking (and waterproof too) 4x6 prints that are a world apart from anything inkjet printers can do.  The obvious downsides are 1. paper and color cartridge kits are expensive and 2. 4x6 is the maximum print size.  Other than that, these printers are great fun.  And they are so small these days, you can take one on a trip and print your own postcards to send home.  Canon models are: CP-220, CP-400, CP-330, CP-600 (the later two models include a rechargeable battery, so you don't even need a power source for printing).  Another choice is the Sony DPP-FP30, which is almost as small and has slightly better colors.","In the 7-megapixel class alone, Canon makes at least 3 current consumer models: the G6 (w/ 4X zoom), the S70 (w/ 3.6X zoom), and SD500 (the new \"Elph\", w/ 3X zoom).  These are priced similarly, within $100 of difference.  (Incidentally, here's a tidbit about the zooming capabilities - the closest telephoto zoom of the \"3.6X\" on the S70 is like a 3X zoom on most other cameras.  The extra \".6\" is on the wide angle end, which is rather unique and is nice for taking in vast sceneries.)<br /><br />My previous digital camera (a Sony Cyber-Shot with 3 megapixels and 3X zoom) was one of the ultra compacts and although I loved the portability and was content with the lower pixel count, I was dissatisfied with the graininess and contrast of the pictures (despite much effort to adjust to lighting situations within the limited interface) and ultimately I put the blame on the quality of the optics.<br /><br />For selecting my new camera, the G6 receives rave reviews almost everywhere I looked, but I wasn't willing to jump to such a large camera (when I am out and taking pictures it's for fun, not for professional use - carrying a big hunk of a camera inteferes with enjoying the trip).  The SD500 is one of Canon's Elph series cameras with an amazingly diminutive size, but previous experience makes me doubtful of the ability of another ultra compact.  And even though reviews do say the SD500 takes good quality pictures, one thing's for sure - it has fewer controls than I'd like.  The S70 happily sits half way between those two, is reasonably compact, and has just enough user controllability that I thought I needed.  Most importantly of all, the S70 seems to have just enough size to house the quality optics necessary for taking great pictures.  My old camera used to take perfectly respectable outdoors photos, but in any indoors lighting condition it took either grainy pictures with bad contrast, or extremely over exposed pictures if I enable the flash.  Not so with this one.  Every snap shot so far has been crisp and vivid, with good contrast and beautiful flesh tones.  The resolution at 7MP is more than necessary for any practical inkjet-printing-at-home purpose, but on the other hand it allows for quite a bit of freedom for cropping if you need to re-frame a shot to get the best composition.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning, a slightly gimmicky but very nifty function is that this camera facilitates taking multiple pictures that can be seamlessly \"stitched\" together (by showing a portion of the previous picture when you take the next shot).  This allows great possibilities of making VR files where the viewer can navigate the surroundings 360 degrees.  I am toying with the idea of producing a few \"virtual\" house walk-throughs for a friend's webpage, who's a real estate agent.<br /><br />Now, what I don't like about the S70 is that the mechanical motors for the moving parts operate way too loudly.  You can go to CNET to see a video clip of the zoom lens coming out and hear what I mean.  Otherwise, just a few minor quibbles on the interface which is arranged not quite as conveniently as I'd like.  No complaints whatsoever for the picture quality.  The S70 is, definitely, one of the finest cameras of its class.","I have done quite a research on the portable 7MP cameras (especially the ones that supports add on lens) and this S70 stands out. The Canon G6 is equally good but its bulky and weighs more. Even though movie support is not great in S70, we rarely take full-fledged movie in a portable camera. And the battery life of around 260 shots is enough for people like me for a day of outdoor shooting(you may sometime have to carry extra battery). The image quality is comparable to any good ones in this range. [...]","This camera is wonderful.  Shots are crisp and clear, even in the dark on auto!!!!  Auto-focus is much quicker than my old S40, fast enough to catch my speedy toddler!!  I highly recommend this camera to everyone!!","This camera seems great so far, except for the fact that I get many pictures with red-eye.  I have read through the manual twice to correct this and it still happens.  The manual says to tell the person to look into the camera to avoid this, well it still happens.  For the money you spend on this camera, you think this would not happen.  My Sony digital camera rarely has this problem.","it worths more that it costs.great spesifications cheap price.easy to use, magnificient picture quality..do not hesitate..you will love it...","Canon has enhanced the PowerShot line with the introduction of the S70.  The only drawback that I've seen with this model so far is that Canon has moved the rear display screen over to the left more than in the S50 so you don't have a place to rest your left thumb while taking pictures.  The S50 was easier to hold in that respect.  In addition, the S70 uses the same underwater housing as the S60 (WP-DC40), but not the same as the S50 (WP-DC300).  The quality of the pictures is great and the software that comes with the camera is quite nice.  For additional information, check out the S70 on the Canon web site.","This camera utilizes the new Sony 7.1 MP chip and marries that superb chip to Canon's digital processing technology and accurate exposure capability to produce outstanding photographs.<br /><br />The S70 Canon has an excellent 28-100 equivalent lens, superb exposure, and accurate focusing.  For a point and shoot the S70 produces excellent low noise photographs at not only ISO 50, but 100 as well with very acceptable noise levels at 200 and 400 as well.  This will come as a welcome relief to those who are accustomed to unacceptable noise levels in point and shoot camera above ISO 50.<br /><br />The dynamic range, color rendition, and solid build quality are very impressive.  I love the metallic finish.  If you are so inclined the camera possesses RAW capability which comes in handy if you are going to explore the possibilities of the digital darkroom.<br /><br />The white balance, as in virtually all point and shoot cameras and most digital SLR's, is less than ideal.  I wish Canon would attach a flash shoe to this camera.  But, you can't have it all, at least not in the S70!<br /><br />The size of this camera, given its capabilities, is perfect - not too small and not too large.  I liked the S60, but this is a very significant improvement.<br /><br />Whether you are a beginner  or an experienced digital photographer this camera will serve you well.  For the beginner plenty of automation and programmed functions in order that you can begin immediately and get excellent results.  And for the more experienced photographer the camera offers a plethora of controls including RAW format to extend your capabilities.","I did a fair amount of research and found Canon to be a highly regarded cameras.  I have to agree, now being an owner.  I previously had a Sony that had slow response times between shots and less then impressive colors and clarity.<br /><br />My family just finshed a week long cruise and used the Canon quite extensively.  Very few times did I have to delete a picture because I was unhappy (unlike the sony).  I am still getting use to the various 'presets' for diffent environmental setting (portrait, highspeed, etc.).<br /><br />I also bought a 1 gig Ultra Memory Card ($129 @ Best Buy).  Must have!  Inserted the card, set the camera at the highest resolution, and the camera read 325+ pictures available!!","This camera takes great pictures when everything is going your way.  Colors are rich and vibrant.  Camera also haully functional manual controls for the enthusiast.<br /><br />However, this camera has flaws which absolutely ruin an otherwise great product.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />1.)  Subtantial barrelling at widest zoom.  The effect was some of the most pronounced I've ever seen (really evident with indoor close-up flash/nonflash shots).  Of course, as you extend the zoom a little bit, the effect goes away, but for an expensive camera to have this issue where you have to constantly extend the zoom to eliminate this detrimental effect is unforgiveable. Far cheaper cameras don't have this issue...<br /><br />2.)  As with many Canon digital cameras, I noticed the dreaded purple chromatic aberration.  For instance, when you focus on a shaded tree against the blue sky in late afternoon, you can see what I mean by purple halo effect surrounding the branches.  While purple fringing is an issue with digital cameras, the S70 exhibited this problem to a much larger degree than my Olympus C-3000 or Sony DSCW1, which are MUCH, MUCH better in this regard.<br /><br />3.)  Nightime shots are competent, but less vibrant and detailed than others in its price range.<br /><br />4.)  Sliding door needs to go.  Such moving parts will ultimately fail.  It acts sturdy but ultimately it's geared to loosen up to the point where the door mechanism will slide a little and turn the camera off.  Canon:  if you're listening, get rid of these doors  (don't copy the popular Olympus cameras which have this same silly flaw).<br /><br />5.)  Proprietary Li-Ion batteries need to go.  They charge fast and hold a decent charge, but are expensive to replace or to get a spare.  If you run out of juice on a vacation while hiking, for  instance, you can't put a AA in there as you could with its cheaper Powershot brothers.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this camera as it has all the features that I was looking for:  a prosumer camera with sturdy body and LCD screen (plastic cover over LCD is great).<br /><br />However, the flaws of barrelling or purple fringing make this a true deal killer.  Other flaws I listed could be forgiven if the images were without such noticeable defects.....I'll wait and hold off for upcoming improved products."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot G6","amazon_reviews":["Got it<br />Thank you","Great","More portable than the G1,G2 or the G5...just that it can`t charge the batteries like the other three models that I have.","as described","I had used this model camera at work and it was what I wanted and needed for my own use.

Com uma excelente qualidade de imagem e um desempenho robusto é uma máquina que serve para mim como câmara suplente e permite que eu possa deixar em certas ocasiões especialmente saídas à noite o meu equipamento dSLR volumoso e pesados em casa. Os 7 megapixel de resolução, a excelente lente com abertura máxima 2.0 e o baixo ruído nas imagens são mais do que suficientes para fazerem fotografias impressionantes até A3. Na série G da Canon eu só trocaria esta câmara pela \"recente\" G11, cujo valor é muitíssimo superior.<br /><br />Gosto:<br />* Qualidade fotográfica excelente<br />* Ecrã LCD rotativo<br />* Excelente lente com abertura máxima f:2.0<br />* Disponibilidade de controlo totalmente manual<br />* Lâmpada de assistência de focagem potente e eficiente<br />* Suporta conversores e adaptadores de lentes adicionais<br />* Possui sapata para flash externo<br />* Painel LCD superior informativo muito útil com iluminação<br />* Duração excelente da bateria<br />* Pode-se gravar até duas configurações pessoais no selector rotativo<br />* Suporta imagens no formato RAW<br />* Selector com os seguintes modos de exposição:  Auto, Scene Program, Program, Manual, Prioridade à abertura, Prioridade à velocidade e 2 modos de exposição totalmente configuráveis pelo utilizador<br /><br />Não gosto:<br />* Arranque um pouco lento<br />* Suavidade excessiva em certos detalhes das fotografias<br />* A distância focal da lente começa só nos 35mm<br />* Ecrã LCD pequeno<br />* Sensibilidade máxima limitada a 400 ISSO<br />* O modo de filme está limitado a 30segundos e 10 fotogramas /seg. na máxima resolução","Had a Canon G6 years ago, gave it up for a Digital Rebel. After a myriad of other cameras i got a used G6 with bent CF pins for $10 and straightened the pins. Figured I would sell it and now finding myself selling one of my other cameras instead. This is a wonderful little camera, high resolution, don't expect anything higher than ISO 100 to be great, then again don't expect any compact to be great over 100. Its usable all the way up to 400 but i tend to not shoot over ISO 50 anyways.","I got this camera in early 05 and have been thrilled with it.  It has been banged around, dropped, spilled on, etc and never had a problem.  I would highly recommend it to anyone!","I purchased this camera in July 2005.  I have taken thousands of pictures with this camera.  It's easy to operate.  The camera has a lot of functionality to it.  It's great for those of us who don't want to move up to a DSLR.<br /><br />In the two-plus years I've owned the camera, I've not had one problem with it.  It just survived a trip to the races at the dirt track in Wheatland, MO.","The Canon Powershot G6 is a nice amera, Physically the camera looks a bit different than the G5, the G6 is narrower and stubbier. The extra Girth supported by the G6 makes it easier to handle than its predecessors. especially those with large hands like me.<br /><br />What i like about this camera is the 9 point auto focus point, which it got from the higher end SLR professional cameras. Normally, to focus on a subject one has to aim using the center of the camera, where the focusing point is. but what if you want to put some artistic flare into your photo, and what if you have to subjects that are not aligned? by having the 9 auto focus point spread throughout the viewing area, when you press the shutter half way, the camera instantly focuses on all the subjects. it instantly puts squares over what you have in the frame indicating That it has locked on. it will then adjust the settings and the light to give you the best possible shot. The downside of this camera is that it is expensive.<br /><br />Whether your an amateur enthusiast or a serious Photographer on the verge of going pro the Canon G6 is for you.","This is my third digital camera I have owned, and it is by far the best. It takes wonderful pictures (excellent I must say!) and the rechargeable batteries do last a long time without having to recharge them all the time. I can take about a hundred pictures before I think about recharging them. Yes, I do take pics with the LCD on. I do not find that it is slow turning on and getting ready for the first shot. Mine is really fast. Also, buy a compactflash card that has a 20 MB/sec sequential read/write speed (SanDisk SDCFX3-2048-901 2 GB Extreme III CompactFlash Card). With this type of card you will be able to take your next shot immediately.","I was in the market to buy a new camera last year and walked into BestBuy alone just browsing.  I have an older EOS Canon Rebel 35mm Camera from 1992, and I loved that camera too.<br /><br />So this was my second camera purchase, and was not sure what I wanted, but I knew what I wanted to take pictures of.  I take this camera everywhere, vacations, visiting friends and family, take pictures of scenery, sporting events, and people.<br /><br />There are a lot of options on this camera that I don't know how to use, but can't wait to learn them too.  I upgraded my memory card to 1 GB so I can take a lot of pictures and not have to worry about running out of room.<br /><br />When I travel or go to a sporting event, I take anywhere from 75 to 200 piictures.  I get a lot of compliments on the camera and the photos it takes are great!","This camera has been called a \"pro-sumer\" model and you should really take that title seriously. The quality of the pictures that it takes are just as good as a professional digital camera of the same resolution. The trade off is that it is really not happy being thrown in a bag (or big pocket, if it fits). Why? Because Canon have given it a really annoying power-on switch that is guaranteed to turn the camera on 90% of the time when you're moving it to or from a bag. To compound this problem, the lens extends (in your bag), pushing off the lens cap and leaving it open for possible damage. So, if you think of this as a professional camera, to be kept in a real camera-case, you'll probably be okay. If you're somebody, like me, who likes to throw his camera in a bag or pocket, you're going to be annoyed by the power switch. That said, I do LOVE the quality of the pictures and all control that the camera gives you over every aspect of taking them.<br /><br />CONS: stupid power-on switch that always catches and turns camera on; lens cap is kind of loose and falls off easily; widest angle is maybe a little too telephoto still (around 35mm?)<br /><br />PROS: awesome pictures; tons of controls all over the outside of the camera allowing you to control a lot without having to resort to menus; professional features including flash hot-shoe and replaceable lens; great battery life; awesome pictures","I bought my G6 a month ago and have taken 441 photos.<br /><br />There is a real, and serious lag between the time you press the button and the time the camera takes the picture.  You can cut the lag in half by focusing first and holding the button down halfway until you are ready to shoot, but that fails if your subject takes a step toward you or away from you.  If your subject is your 2 year old grandson, he moves all the time.  Minus one star.<br /><br />The optical viewfinder only shows about 80% of the image the camera captures, and that varies with the zoom setting.  You can cut off the head of your subject without knowing it and embarrass yourself when you see your photo or include a bunch of white space and waste pixels and paper.  Minus 1/2 star.<br /><br />The \"on\" switch has turned itself on twice, once when I put the camera into the large cargo pocket of my heavy winter coat and went for a walk and once when I put the camera into a separate shoulder bag and put that in the car.  That can damage the camera if the extended lens tube gets bent.  Minus 1/2 star.<br /><br />Good news:<br /><br />The 7 MP are enough to print an 8x10 photo at the \"standard\" 300 dpi.<br /><br />It has plenty of zoom range,4X.<br /><br />The battery lasts a very long time.  I took 327 photos with the builtin flash on the first charge and used the flipout screen to explore options quite often and only charged it a second time because I was going to photo a birthday party and wanted to be sure not to have the battery run out in the middle of the party.<br /><br />The G6 has a hot shoe for an extra flash, and can control a Canon Speedlite to make much better flash photos than the builtin flash on any digital camera.<br /><br />I decided to keep the camera but I have ordered a case for it to prevent it turning itself on while being transported.","The Canon G6 is a great camera.  I upgraded from a Canon Powershot A80 to the G6.  The A80 showed me that Canon makes a good camera, but was lacking a few features I really wanted.<br /><br />To me, this camera is a perfect collection of compromises.  I want a small camera for family snapshots, that's easy to use.  I want a large, capable camera for art work like portraits and landscape, and action shots like sports and recreation.<br /><br />When I'm on vacation, and want some snaps of the kids goofing around or of dinner or something, I don't need a camera that makes me jump through hoops to get a decent shot, I just want to point and shoot.  In full auto, or aperature priority, or shutter speed priority, the pictures are usually sharp and crisp.  Set the image size to one of the medium or small settings and you can use the high speed multi-shot feature to get a series of action shots that guarantee that you'll get at least a few good ones.<br /><br />I have no qualms about setting this camera to auto, handing this camera to a person with little or no photgraphic experience, and letting them click away.  It's easy enough to learn that most folks can be taking nice pictures in less than an hour, and pros can be taking great pictures in no time at all.<br /><br />On the other hand, a lot of the work I do is very artistic, and involves using manual settings.  When going for the perfect picture, it is often necessary to adjust the focus, aperature, and shutter speed to get the exact picture you want.  This camera has manual focus, a feature I sorely missed on my older Powershot A80.<br /><br />Another thing that bothers me on most other cameras, is that you have to wade through a bewilderingly large collection of menu options to make the smallest changes.  While I can understand using a layer or two of menus for things like basic settings (time, format a CF card) I can't see it for something as basic as film speed or white balance.<br /><br />Which is why I love this camera.  The following items are one button away:<br /><br />Flash<br /><br />Flash Output Level<br /><br />Multi-image<br /><br />Time delay photo<br /><br />Autofocus area<br /><br />Macro mode<br /><br />Manual Focus<br /><br />White Balance<br /><br />Zoom in / out<br /><br />Film Speed (50 to 400)<br /><br />Picture mode (auto, Manual, Manual preset 1 and 2, Av, Tv, Portratit, Landscape, Backlit, Panorama, movie)<br /><br />My favorite things about this camera:<br /><br />Battery life is excellent.  I bought a spare battery, but I've never actually use the one that came with it in less than a day.  It charges fast too.<br /><br />Picture quality:  The larger lens allows for better pictures in low light conditions, and it is very clear.  The large CCD allows you to get pictures in a large enough resolution to print out fairly large copies and have them look very good.<br /><br />Ergonomic.  This is a very comfortable camera to hold for a long time.  It's not quite in the same range as some much more expensive units, but I've never gotten tired from holding it.  Plus, all the buttons you need to hit while running it are right there under your fingertips.  The scroll wheel under your right index finger is very intuitive to operate.  Push it to change modes, roll it to change the settings.  The fold out screen allows you to take pictures from odd angles without ever having to lay down on your back for a picture.  Plus, the fold out screen feels very solidly built, not like it'll snap off in your hands.  I was always worried about my Powershot A80, as it didn't feel very solid.<br /><br />It works well with my computer, which runs Linux.  I use gtkam, a great camera program<br /><br />It has an infrared remote that can be used to take pictures without worrying about camera shake.  This is very useful for group pictures you'd like to be in yourself.<br /><br />User savable white balance settings.<br /><br />Real flash shoe.  This camera takes a standard Canon flash unit.<br /><br />Manual focus mode puts a close up of the center of the screen right in the middle of the picture for you to check the focus with. This would be really bothsome for composing pictures, except that when you half depress the shutter button, the small zoomed square in the center disappears and leaves you with the whole picture.<br /><br />The rapid fire photo option is very useful for action shots, and some candid stuff, like subway pictures.<br /><br />The mechanical view finder is more than just an adornment on this camera.  It's quite good, and it changes its field of view according to the current zoom setting.  It also has a focus adjustment on it.  This is very nice if you wear glasses, as it lets you adjust the view finder to your eye, and you can get your eye right up to it, and not keep bumping your glasses into the back of the camera.<br /><br />Very wide open Fstop of 2.0 to very closed off 8.0.<br /><br />And lastly, it remembers virtually everything you setup the last time it was on or in a certain mode, and reverts to those settings the next time you turn it on or switch modes.  This includes things like white balance, settings that were NOT remembered by my Powershot A80.<br /><br />Now for the negatives:<br /><br />The door that covers the USB port / DC input, and AV output is very easy to catch in the swivelling / revolving fold out screen, and as the screen takes a fare bit of effort to revolve, it's quite likely you'll have snapped the door in half before you notice it's gone and gotten itself caught in the spinning LCD screen that's passing by.  If it's gotten a little bent, it will get caught every time by the fold out screen until you snap it off or bend it back in place.<br /><br />The flash is way too close to the lens, which makes for some pretty obvious shadows in the bottom right hand corner of some photos.  Luckily, I'm not much for flash usage, and if I was, I'd probably spring for a real flash that sat in the hot shoe.  Still, if you're looking for a great built in flash, this is NOT the camera for you.<br /><br />Slow focus, and the autofocus can become confused by objects within a few yards, and never really focus.  Plus, focusing is pretty slow.  If you are looking for a camera with a very fast, nearly perfect autofocus, you might do better with another camera.<br /><br />Movies are limited to 3 minutes maximum, which seems rather arbitrary.  Even 5 minutes would be a big step up, as it would allow me to catch the average musical performance in one step.<br /><br />Final Word:<br /><br />This is a great compromise camera for someone who really wants two separate cameras but can't afford them.  It's a good snap shot camera, and a good big lense, big body, big CCD machine capable of creating art.<br /><br />It's not the best at either of those categories when compared to other cameras, but for one that does both, it represents a a perfect compromise at a pretty reasonable price.","I am by no means a pro at taking pictures, but this camera makes me look close to it. So far I have just used it as a point and shoot and the pictures have been of really good quality. I am tring to learn more of the functions and one I have run across so far that I enjoy is you can choose in certain functions for your photo to be black and white, color, or sepia. I am not high tech but I can use this camera pretty easily. My first digital camera was a canon digital elf with only 3.2 mega pixels and there is a huge difference in the quality of the pictures when you compare. So if you can affored to spend more for more mega pixels do it. The only down sides I have seen so far is it doesn't come w/ a great memory card which most do not and I imagine if I did not have small hands that the camera would be a little awkward to handle. It has lots of buttons and dials so you have to hold just right so that you don't hit any. But overal I am very satisfied w/ my purchase and hope to become a better photographer with the help of this camera. Canon cameras have served my family and I very well over the years.","Incredible quality and zoom!  Low power consumption.  Buy the 1GB SanDisk compact flash card.  It gives you plenty of room for a 2-3 week vacation.","A camera more for the advanced photographer with a very detailed instruction booklet. Takes excellent photos in auto mode. Memory chip included is not near big enough.","This camera does all that Canon says it does.  Fantastic pictures.  Great flexibility for manual control or simple point-and-shoot use.  I did a lot of research before buying, and I could not be happier with the Canon G6.","This is my third digital camera, but it's been a few years since the second and it was definitely obsolete. I was tempted to go top of the line, because I've two excellent SLRs (Nikon and Minolta) with all the trimmings, but the prices made that unfeasible right now.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied with the features of the Canon G6 however; I've taken about 400 shots so far, plus one movie, tried out all the software for stitching panoramas together, etc. I still mainly use PhotoShop, but the Canon software is quite good.<br /><br />The photo quality is excellent, including color and the optical<br /><br />zoom and wideangle range is good for most purposes. The macro setting also does a nice job.<br /><br />The controls are easy to use for the most part for anyone at all familiar with full featured SLRs, and better than most. I've made very few mistakes in the field as a result of control confusion.<br /><br />What I'm less thrilled about (nitpicking):<br /><br />Like most electronics these days, even if you've got very small hands like me, it is hard to keep from getting a finger in the wrong place, just about every square inch is covered with a control. I would have liked to have an insert (like Nikon supplies) to cover the flash hotshoe contacts. And every time I remove the battery or memory card, I have to watch out to grab the camera by the few areas that don't have a control on them. Also, the cable input has a typical tiny plastic door that would be all too easy to break off, and the neck strap attachment is too close to the memory card door, and tends to interfere with it opening all the way.<br /><br />Also, in preview mode it tells you how many shots you have taken but not how many left, and in shooting mode, vice versa. It is annoying to have to switch to shooting mode to see how many left, especially if you are using the lens cover, because then the lens deploys out, and you have to remember to take the lens cover off first (deploying the lens with the cover on is a no-no.)<br /><br />I also got the camera case designed for the G6. Again like all too many \"cases\" it is a tight fit, only has a single inside pocket that you can only get an extra card in and still get the camera in too. And the case would not really be good dust protection and it zips up the sides but the top opening is just covered by a flap. And because of the tight and awkward fit, it is easy to accidentally turn the camera on, deploying the lens, while putting the camera into the case. The case comes with a belt loop, but you have to supply your own belt, and it has no other strap or handle except a tiny loop located at the top end of on side zipper, where it just gets in the way. Not a good design.<br /><br />I also checked out some of the accessories available, like additional lens and flash, but they're very expensive, like the macro lights are more than the camera! So I don't know if I'll get any of the add-ons later on.<br /><br />But overall, the G6 is already my next favorite camera to my Nikon SLR, powerful yet easy to use, and even fun! Definitely 5 stars for the camera, 1 star for the case.","I have only had the camera for a short time but have truly enjoyed using it.  It is easy to use, the camera takes sharp pictures and the colors are true.  It as easy to set up and use initially and the built in flash works well for up to about 12-14 feet.  I look forward to learning more about the features.","I love this camera....I've had it for a little over a month now and it's been nothing but good to me.  The instructions were clear and the pictures even clearer!!","Have use the Canon G6 camera for the last two months and I'm quite impressed with the quality of the photos and its operations.  The photo sharpness and vivid colors are superb!! It is also easy to use.  I found that you must rely on the viewfinder for outdoor shots - their is always to much glare on the LCD.  The flexible LCD is fantastic for viewing shots. Have not tried out all of the manual functions yet and may not have too - this camera takes great pictures in auto mode.  Battery life is very good - shot well over 200 pictures with plenty of juice left for viewing.  Shot movies and panorama images and both were excellent.  So far I'm a happy customer...","I purchased this camera as a upgrade from my first one and I LOVE it! It takes wonderful high quality pictures! It is so easy to use with some very cool features! I love the picture zoom, also takes great close up shots! If you are considering this camera, go for it!! You will love it! Ton's of accessories are available, very nicly made camera!!!","I purchased this camera about a month ago and have taken at least a hundred photos with it so far.  I'm still learning the technical jargon of photography and it'll probably take a few more months to learn everything this camera can do.<br /><br />It's not going to fit in your pocket, but it will fit in a small camera case you can put on your belt or over your shoulder.  A lot of people scoff at anything that isn't a digital SLR, but their size makes them too cumbersome to carry around if you like to go out in the \"bush\" with you.  With 7.1 megapixels, you will get sharp pictures that can be blown up large enough to put hang on the wall (perhaps 11X17 or larger).  Remember, you won't see much if any difference on a computer screen because the most CRT's resolution is less than 7 megapixels.  It's only when you zoom in that you notice the increased detail.<br /><br />If you're an amateur photographer that wants to learn photography and produce high-quality images, you can get this camera for under $500 bucks.  I suggest at least buying the 58MM adapter for the wide angle lens or telephoto, because you can then buy polarizing filters, which are essential for taking excellent photos on sunny days.  I think that the most overated stat on these types of cameras is the zoom.  It's occaisionally useful to have some zoom capability, but most of the time you want a wide angle shot to show the largest field of vision possible, especially for scenery shots.<br /><br />If you really want 5x optical zoom or more, don't buy this camera, but make sure you get one with image stabilization.<br /><br />I even saw it for sale for $360, but that deal actually sounded too good to be true!  Search around and find the best price-I paid about $480 bucks. BUT do read the store reviews and make sure you're dealing with a reputable place.","This is my third Canon digital camera, an upgrade from my Elf S400, a very nice camera that took very nice pictures. But the G6 blows it out of the water in terms of features and picture quality. Coming from the film school, I have not seen many digitals that could replace Kodak or Fuji slide film... until now. One picture on automatic out of the box made me a believer... superb! Flash shots are perfectly exposed edge to edge even in very dim light. And the list of features will take me years to learn, although many are similar to 35mm film boxes. Taking a poor picture with this camera would require either a defective unit or body movement while shooting. The included remote control takes care of hand shake blur.... a winner of a feature. I compared sample pictures on line from this camera, the Pro1, and the Sony DSCV3. Of course, I read all the reviews as well. The pictures from the G6 were the same or slightly better than from the Pro1 and significantly better than the Sony. This camera is a real deal for what you get... recommended without reservation for someone who wants more than a point-and-shoot model, although it does this extremely well. If is also for the person who enjoys a learning curve and who does not mind a camera with a bit extra bulk and weight... it is like a compact SLR film camera.","I owned previously a Canon S45. I decided to move up a little bit as my interest in ohotograpy increased. I own this G6 now for about 4 months. Very user friendly and picture quality is perfect. They could put a little bit more zoom though.<br /><br />The only con to me is the lens adapter if you want to use filters or other lenses.<br /><br />An almost SLR...","I had been using a Powershot A20 (2 megapixel) camera for several years and decided to upgrade to a digital camera that gave me the ability to learn and use shutter speeds, lenses, etc.  I didn't want to spend $1,000 or more on a camera that required instant knowledge of basic photography (it's been many years since I tried to manually focus).  The G6 has provided everything I wanted.  By using the various modes (Auto, P, Tv, Av and M), I can take point & shoot shots for general use and still have the option to use manual controls to learn the best shutter speed for water shots, etc.  The 4x optical zoom is fine for most shots, and with the 1.75x teleconverter you increase that to 7x.  The macro and supermacro setings are absolutely fantastic - I've got shots of dew drops on flowers that are amazing.  There are many other settings in the menu and function areas worth looking at.  The vivid setting punches up colors (perfect for flowers, etc. but be careful to change it back when shooting people), the ND filter is great when you want to use slow shutter speeds, and the flash sync allows you to change when the flash goes off.  One of the coolest abilities of this camera is the ability to shoot in Jpeg and, during the review period right after taking the shot, push the flash button and your shot is converted into RAW.  This means that you don't need to take all your shots in RAW (just in case you get that one special shot).  As RAW reduces your storage capacity by more than half, this is wonderful.  The battery life is one of the best - I can get about 3-5 days of average use (50-80 photos/day) on one battery charge.  I bought one extra battery and I haven't found myself without power yet.  I use one til it dies, pop in the other and finish my day, then that night I charge the first (it only takes 90 minutes) and the next day I'm ready to go again.  No more pockets filled with disposable batteries.<br /><br />In respect to the included 32mb card, you definitely want more (512mb minimum) - however, in the world of digital cameras, 32mb included is pretty good.  Many still include an 8mb card only.<br /><br />Memory storage at the Large/Superfine (3072 x 2304) setting are as follows:<br /><br />32mb - 9 shots<br /><br />64mb - 19<br /><br />128mb - 40<br /><br />256mb - 81<br /><br />512mb - 163<br /><br />1gb - 327<br /><br />2gb - 645<br /><br />Note that these numbers are affected by additional settings such as landscape, wide angle, zoom, macro and supermacro, in addition to the complexity of the shot composition (landscape vs. single flower).  However, in my usage, I have found them to be accurate enough to bank on.<br /><br />All in all, this camera has provided me with a great \"point and shoot\" camera with great advancement potential.  In addition, it actually assists me in learning photographic techniques (use the Tv mode and manually set your shutter speed, the camera automatically sets the best matching aperture setting - after a while you start to get a feel for what combinations work best).","I am convinced that this is the best 7-megapixel camera in its class.  My previous cameras have been Canon Powershot s45, Minolta A1, and the Sony V1.  This surpasses them all.  I was very pleased with the sensor in the camera and have found that it has much less noise than the 8-megapixel variety.  Many 8-megapixel cameras have had some noise and \"fringing\" issues in trying to cram too many megapixels on such a small sensor, but the G6 is the perfect \"marriage\" between resolution and compactness.  The G6 is very responsive and is fast between shots.<br /><br />Some bells and whistles that I did not plan on using very much but that now I cannot live without are the swivel LCD and the remote.  They have greatly added to the \"fun factor\" of the camera!<br /><br />I am a bit annoyed with some people giving this camera marks even as low as four stars, for reasons that are beyond the scope of the camera (example- reviewers wishing that the G6 had a longer optical zoom).  If you want a longer zoom, then buy a camera with a longer zoom.<br /><br />This camera deserves a 5-star rating.  It is incredibly good at what it was designed to do- take high quality shots, for those who want a prosumer camera, in a compact unit!","At 7.1 megapixels, this camera delivers images that measure 3072 x 2304 pixels. But a robust megapixel count isn't all the G6 has going for it. Megapixels are meaningless if the optics and the camera's guts are substandard. A lot of high-megapixel cameras create images that lack smoothness, lifelikeness, and detail. The G6 is a total champ in those respects.<br /><br />I've used it for five days now. This is a preliminary verdict.<br /><br />* PROS of the Powershot G6:<br />Very good color accuracy, very good resolution, virtually noisefree even at 400 ISO. AMAZING detail and sharpness, the equivalent of my Nikon D70 digital SLR (?!). Very good macro performance. Built-in neutral-density filter. Fast lens in terms of sensitivity (f2.0). Fast monitor with swivel feature. Pretty much all the user controls you would find on a pro DSLR.<br /><br />* CONS of the Powershot G6:<br />ISO doesn't go beyond 400. Only 4x optical zoom. Lens slow to zoom: 3 seconds from wide to full tele. Slow startup: 3 to 4 seconds until ready for first shot. Noticeable shutter lag, I'd say about half a second. Unresponsive overall if you're used to a DSLR. Too big to easily slip into most pockets. Annoying ON button that's too easy to activate when you stuff the camera into a bag or a tight coat pocket. Not available in a more professional-looking black version.<br /><br />All in all, it's a very good camera that delivers stunning images for the money. I don't think that from an image quality point of view, there's currently a better prosumer camera on the market, unless you step up to an SLR like the EOS D20. But I do find that the reviews at dpreview, steve's digicams and a few other prominent photo sites glossed over the G6's shortcomings. In daily use, the camera is nowhere near as perfect as the online articles suggested. Especially that stupid ON button and the unresponsiveness really affect the pleasure of using it.<br /><br />To be fair, though, the half-second shutter lag and the snail-like speed with which the camera gets ready after you turn it on are hardly exclusive to the G6; other brands and other non-SLR models exhibit the same failings. It's just the nature of the beast, I guess. Bottom line: if you can live with the few drawbacks and are looking for top-notch image quality from a relatively small (but by no means tiny) package, the Powershot G6 delivers.","I received this camera for Christmas, and I wanted to wait to write a review, so that I could really use the camera and put it to the test.  I would consider myself an average amateur photographer.  I have taken a few courses on photography, but I am by no means even close to a pro.  I don't really know how to set the proper f-stop and shutter settings for getting the right exposures in certain lighting.<br /><br />This camera blew me away with how many features it has.  There are still things that I haven't been able to play around with, even after three months of owning it.  The \"auto\" setting pretty much takes care of whatever you can throw at it.  I have used \"auto\" in all different light conditions, and with all sorts of different subjects and scenes, and it has never disappointed me.  I almost feel like they don't need any of the manual settings because the \"auto\" does such a great job.  That is not to say, however, that the manual settings can't improve on the \"auto\".  As with any good camera, when you can tweak the settings you will get fantastic pictures.  I personally love the black and white setting, because I think there is something beautiful about a well-composed b&w photo.  Even when you are in a manual mode the camera will either let you know when a setting isn't right for the shot, or it will automatically correct it.  But enough about the settings, let's get to the pictures.<br /><br />I immediately bought a 512mb CF card, because the camera does not work without a memory card.  The 32mb one that they include is really too small for a 7.1 MP camera.  I have it in my camera bag as an emergency back-up in case I run out of space on my main card.  With the 512mb card, I can get 163 shots in the highest detail setting, which I think is great.  The highest settings can produce photos with massive detail and unbelievable clarity, and you could theoretically print a poster size print and you would love the detail.  One of the complaints that people have about digital cameras is that there is a \"blueing\" on the outer edges of the photos sometimes.  I have yet to experience any significant blueing, whereas I have seen other people with other cameras that have pretty bad blueing.  The zoom is adequate for a  digital camera, but I wish that it could be a little better.  We have a $150 film camera that has much better zoom, and I have no idea why digital cameras can't follow suit.  Anyway, I love every picture that I have taken with this camera, and I find myself going to it over my SLR more and more.  I posted a few photos that I took at a local park near my house called Euclid Creek they day after I got the camera, when I was still just screwing around with it.  I didn't even really know what I was doing, but I think the pics are pretty good.  The pictures I am taking now are so much better.<br /><br />The fold-out LCD screen is great.  It's something that you wouldn't think would be all that different from any other camera, but it truly is a fantastic feature.  I usually fold it out to the side, but you can leave it closed, or flip it around so that it stays on the back of the camera.  Also, when you take a vertically oriented photo, the viewer will automatically flip it so that you can view it along with all the other photos, without having to turn the camera.<br /><br />Lastly, the stitch-assist is a fantastic feature.  My wife and I ski in the rockies, and we love to get panoramic pictures from the peaks.  The camera makes it so easy to get full 360 degree panoramics that you can then blend together on your computer with little trouble.<br /><br />Overall, this camera is fantastic for someone who wants to take great pictures but isn't a pro.  Sure, digital SLRs may have more features, but most people will never use them.  The 7.1 MP resolution, the depth of settings, and the ease of use make this camera a fantastic buy that will be taking oustanding pictures for me for years to come.","This is a great camera. I thought about getting the Digital Rebel because of the ability to change lenses but then I realized that I have a Rebel 2000 SLR sitting in my closet which I have never bought additional lenses for, so I decided to get the G6 instead. It is great camera. If you are looking for a camera that almost rival the lower end Digital SLR's this is it.","This camera has incredible features - 7.1 megapixels, ability to shoot RAW, a much clearer zoom than the powershots directly below it. However, I have had problems with focusing on finer details on objects, or if the object is too close to the camera. The macro mode typically fixes this problem, but difficult lighting scenarios occasionally pose a problem. It has the ability to manually focus and can produce images with incredible depth-of-field, but the auto-focus upon actually shooting occasionally focuses on the wrong objects in the photo. The ability to change the length of exposure is wonderful - up to 15 seconds of exposure.<br /><br />This is a great camera for the mid-range photographer that wants to explore more advanced digital techniques. For advanced photographers who are loyal to the Canon line, I would suggest upgrading to either the 20D or the Digital Rebel. Both are a little easier to focus and produce sharper images and allow attaching other lenses and filters much easier than modifying the G6.","I had been researching digital cameras for some time before making my purchase of my G6 a few weeks ago.  For a few years, I've been shooting with my Minolta Maxxum 5 SLR, because it was lightweight and gave me all the things I needed in a camera.  I broke into digital slowly (as most people did given that just a few years ago, a 2.0MP digital camera ran about $300).  I had a meager Fuji A340 and then moved up to a Canon SD100 which I loved-small with decent images.  I looked around at the digital SLR's, but for what I do, I didn't like two things about them: price and size.  Often when I travel, I tote my camcorder and a camera with me.  Last year, I went to Europe and brought along my Maxxum 5 (for quality shots), my Canon SD100 (for quick, easy shots) and my camcorder, a JVC GR-DV500u for video.  I thought my arm was going to fall off a week into the trip.  The solution: Combine the cameras, i.e. the Canon G6.<br /><br />The G6 offers the easy of a point and shoot digital with the image quality of a digital SLR.  The ergonomics are the best I've ever felt in a camera--the grip is even better than on my Maxxum giving every shot a confident, steady feel.  The lens is fantasticly bright and the colors are accurate.  Whenever possible, I shoot without a flash because I've always found that flash lighting from a camera's on-board flash is often harsh, but Canon has an answer for that too with its adjustable flash output and tight gain control on higher ISO settings.  They included all the nice little extras like the included remote control and lighted top LCD read-out.  Surprisingly, I find myself using the Intravolometer feature quite often to do timelapse photography.  It is a perfect balance of size, price and features.  This is a camera you won't mind taking to a party or taking on a weekend photo-excursion.  The optical viewfinder is quite generous for a camera in this range also.  The ability to shoot RAW images is greatly appreciated, and the fact it uses CompactFlash is excellent.  I got a 1GB card from Sandisk at BestBuy for a measly $68 after rebate.  Hitachi also makes microdrives for CompactFlash slots at very resonable prices too- 4GB is only going to set you back $199--I can remember when the 512Mb cards cost that.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I can't say enough about this camera!","Having used (and reviewed) the precursor G3 model, time came to step up from 4MP to 7 MP. No disappointment there - uncompressed RAW files come out beautifully, and can be tailored exquisitely with the enclosed software. The slighltly larger (2\") LCD is sharp, bright & clear, and still (praise be) swivels as nicely as ever; the menus are crisply lucid; and my G3 accessories (tele lens, battery pack, etc) remain compatible. The display panel (at last) can be illuminated when light is dim, and that irksome view of the lens barrel that used to obstruct the optical viewfinder has been corrected (finally) by recessing the lens and relocating the finder. The consistently high-rated 4x zoom lens remains identical to that in the preceding models; it is claimed to have improved antireflective coating.<br /><br />The body is a bit smaller and lighter than the G3 or G5, but this still is no pocket camera; and that attractive black finish of the G5 has been changed back to the original silver color. Not so nice at all is the exact halving of the original excellent user instruction manual to pocket size. The English is as lucid as ever, but now barely readable in half-size font; and the tight binding doesn't keep the book open at a page - a real pain! To be PC, one now gets two pint-size manuals in the box - one English and one Spanish. Fortunately, you can download the full size printing from the Canon website - but couldn't those pdf files have been included in the accompanying CD? Likewise the software manual, disfigured by a \"Copy\" watermark on each page.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the accessory tele, wide and macro lenses - these require a separate adapter, bringing their cost close to that of an SLR lens. In other words, if 4x zoom doesn't meet your needs, spring for a digital SLR! Overall, not yielding to the 8MP race (which has not reviewed well), the 7MP sensor seems to fare much better in reviews, with the G6 offering the sharpest resolution and minimal color fringing. It will take jerky \"movies\", but if you are at all serious, use a camcorder. This top-rated prosumer camera has SLR-like manual controls; but it needs a much higher quality printed manual to clarify the many features - you'd never figure out that the flash button converts the current image from JPEG  to RAW, for instance.<br /><br />Visible cost-trimming measures such as half-size manuals printed on cheap paper, downsized frame, and skimpy 32MB memory card can only raise concerns about invisible corner cutting of the camera's innards. Time will tell.","This is my first digital camera that i purchased after spending hours and hours over the web, comparing different cameras and reading reviews. I would say I am glad with my purchase. Only problems I noticed are<br /><br />1. Focusing and Red eye problem in low light<br /><br />2. Zoon is only 4X, You definitely need more zoom if you are going to take pictures in functions like graduation comencement where you are not very close to the object.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Amazingly Exceeeeeeeeeeeellent picture quality<br /><br />- Adjustable LCD like camcorders ( I luv it)<br /><br />- Wireless remote<br /><br />- Battery life is not bad<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Focusing and red eye problem in low light<br /><br />- I need more zoom than 4X","I was debating between the Canon Pro 1 and the Canon G6 to replace my Nikon Coolpix.  After much research I decided on the Canon G6.  Although the Pro 1 has a longer zoon it lacks the AF assist beam for shots taken in dark conditions.  I took some shots in complete darkness using the AF assist beam and the pictures turned out great.  The G6 is awesome camera with excellent picture quality--even better than I expected.  The pictures are clear and the colors are vibrant.  The recycling time between pictures is much faster than either of the Nikon Coolpix I own.<br /><br />The G6 has a wide range of features for beginners and more advanced users.  I recommend taking the time to read the users guide to get to know what the G6 is capable of.  For those of who like black and white or sepia pictures--no problem with the G6.  You can record pictures or movies in either.<br /><br />The included Canon software is easy to install and use.  When your G6 is hooked up to your computer you have complete control over camera through the software.  You also get a good amount of accessories included with the G6:  shoulder strap, 32 MB CF card (you will need an additional card), and wireless remote.  You can also expand the G6 capabilities with the purchase of additional lenses or flashes.<br /><br />Although this is not a pocket camera, it is not heavy and can easily be carried all day.  The camera grip on the G6 has a \"pro\" feel to it and adds stability while taking pictures.<br /><br />If you're looking for a camera that takes great pictures with lots of features, but don't want to pay the price for a digital SLR the G6 should be on the top of your list.","I originally bought a compact camera, Nikon 4200, 4MP.<br /><br />The indoor and outdoor shots were horrible, both being blury.<br /><br />This camera takes great photos indoor and out, not blury.<br /><br />The video results are also great.  Also, the camera is extremely sturdy and is great quality.<br /><br />Battery life seems to be doing good also.<br /><br />The delay lag is pretty quick, not a quick as Rebel G but all digital cameras under 1K must Autofocus first and take a bit.<br /><br />Autofocus is pretty reasonable.<br /><br />Get this camera if you are in the market and you are not hung up on a compact but a good quality camera that takes good pics.","Just had this for a week or so now, and it's my first digital, though I do wedding photography (on film and rented high-end digital cams) and I'm pretty experienced with photography.<br /><br />My wife and I were with some friends in Flagstaff, AZ, and in addition to kicking around town, we hiked Humphrey's Peak (at 12,633', the highest peak in AZ). For night shots, portraits, panoramas (with Stitch Assist-- see below), scenics, and candids, this is a great camera.<br /><br />It's not as fast and responsive as my film camera, but no point-and-shoot digital is at this point. The only cameras that are that quick in focusing and processing are the high-end digital SLR bodies. So for the price, this is a very responsive and able camera.<br /><br />The Stitch Assist feature is very impressive. With the included software, I just downloaded the photos to Zoom Browser EX, selected the folder where the photos shot with the Stitch Assist mode resided (one folder for each panorama), and the external stitching program automatically put the photos together. There's a little manual control if you like, but it was so easy that I left it alone. I'm normally a tweaker, but it was great without my help. :) I have some great panoramas of the summit of Humphrey's as we were getting to the top.<br /><br />The Macro mode is great as well, as I got a really nice shot of some of the ice pellets that had fallen on the ground. I have a macro setup for my film body, but it's a pain.<br /><br />Vertical and horizontal photos are automatically rotated if you prefer-- a very nice feature. I would prefer not to have to go through hundreds of photos and do post-rotation. I've done it with wedding photos, and it's a pain.<br /><br />The lens on this camera is very good. Overall clarity is good and distortion is low. There is some barrel distortion at the wide angle setting, but it's not too objectionable. Plus the f/2.0 - f/3.0 speed is a boon to low-light shooting. The front-facing flash on this camera is the typical small kind of flash that's also close to the lens. I've always found this kind of lighting harsh and unflattering, so I like to shoot with ambient light if possible. Now that I don't have to use color correction filters and can have the white balance suited to the light color temperature, I can shoot indoors without flash! Finally!<br /><br />Noise levels are pretty good, but not great compared with the high-end digital bodies. Again, not a fair comparison, so for the money, very good. Just not as good as is possible. I can dream, can't I?<br /><br />The only thing that I would like is more zoom range. I guess I could've gotten the Pro 1 with a 10x zoom, but the 35-140 range is good for many things, from scenics to portraits. I also could get one or both of the wide angle/telephoto conversion lenses.<br /><br />A great camera for the money.","i just got this camera tonight.<br /><br />and while i still dont know how to use alot of its features, the random pictures ive taken tonight have been amazing.<br /><br />the tone and quality and saturation is so realistic<br /><br />i took a picture about half an hour ago and the depth of field and quality has seriously blown me away...its not cheap, but its worth every cent for that picture alone...and hopefully many, many more to come.<br /><br />considoring i got amazing results inside with the flash on and not knowing how to work it properly, i can only assume it will get much, much better from here.<br /><br />its not pocket sized, but i dont like tiny flimsy little things anyway.<br /><br />i cant fault it.<br /><br />im inlove with it already, ive even named it haha.<br /><br />if you want all the manual controls of an slr without the price tag of one, SERIOUSLY considor this camera.","Anyone interested in this camera should read professional reviews by people who have actually used the camera.  (...) This site gives a pro. review.  Here's another... (...)These people have actually held the camera and tested them.  I'm guessing that these two reviews are based purely on assumptions.  The camera isn't even available to the general public until sometime in Sept.  People really shouldn't review a product that they haven't even used.","At $699, this camera is overpriced. The sensor size is still 1/1.8\". How does this effect you? You can't really get the nice shallow depth-of-field pictures because of the extreme magnification factor required for using a sensor this small.<br /><br />If you're thinking that you'd like to utilize the manual functionality in order to vary depth of field effects, pay the couple hundred dollars more to get the Digital Rebel. You'll get an APS sized sensor which has much less noise at higher ISOs and will let you take good shallow depth of field pictures.<br /><br />If you don't care about the depth of field effects and/or don't plan on taking pictures at higher ISOs, then this may be the camera for you.","Of all the cameras announced by Canon last week the one we would most likely buy is the Canon Powershot G6.<br /><br />Naturally we would love an Eos 20D but at $1999 with the nice new image stablized lens it is difficult to justify the price unless we were using the camera daily.<br /><br />The Canon Powershot G6 however, can do about 80% of what the 20D can at about a third of the price.<br /><br />Here is why we like it:<br /><br />A new 7.1 megapixel sensor makes pictures from the Canon Powershot G6 large enough for printing out great photos at 8x10 size and most photos will also come out good at 16x20.<br /><br />The Canon Powershot G6 is small and light enough to be carried around most of the day (you can't say the same for the Eos 20D). The G6 is 4.1 x 2.9 x 2.9 inches and 16 ounces, 10% smaller than it's predessor (the G5).<br /><br />There is an excellent LCD display on the Canon Powershot G6: 2.0\" in size, and it tilts, twists, and swivels to almost any position.<br /><br />The 4x optical zoom zoom on the Canon Powershot G6 is more than enough for everyday use.<br /><br />The Canon Powershot G6 accepts standard Compactflash cards, with 512mb Compactflash cards often around $50 these days and 1gb cards coming close to $100 you can get a lot of storage at a good price.<br /><br />Battery life on the Canon Powershot G6 is also improved with a new 10.3 watt-hour version of the Canon BP-511 battery.<br /><br />With the Canon Powershot G6 you would have to work hard to fill up a large memory card or run out of battery power in a day. (battery life is supposed to be 300 shots, in large (3072x2304 pixel) superfine mode you can fit over 300 shots on a 1gb card (and even in the largest RAW storage mode you can fit about 150 shots).<br /><br />A good set of accessories are included in the Canon Powershot G6 box:<br /><br />The 7.1 effective Megapixel Canon PowerShot G6 camera<br />32MB CompactFlash card<br />BP-511A lithium-ion battery<br />Battery charger<br />Wireless remote control<br />Lens cap w/retaining strap<br />Neck strap<br />USB cable<br />A/V cable<br />CD-ROM featuring Canon Digital Camera Solutions, ArcSoft Camera Suite, and drivers<br />Camera manual + software manual (both printed)<br /><br />The inclusion of a wireless remote control is a big plus point, combined with a mini-tripod it makes it simple to take wobble-free photos or self portraits with the Canon Powershot G6.<br /><br />The Canon Powershot G6 also has good range of accessories available:<br /><br />0.7x wide angle lens<br />1.75x telephoto lens<br />Close up lens<br />Converter lens adapter<br />Lens hood<br />External flash<br />Macro ring light<br />Macro twin light<br />AC adapter<br />Car charger cable<br /><br />Overall, the Canon Powershot G6 is an excellent choice for a high quality camera that you can both point and click and fiddle around with nearly all the settings."]},{"name":"Canon EOS 20D","amazon_reviews":["very satisfied","The 20D is a great camera.","I was looking for a inexpensive camera for my daughter to get started with.

You can't go wrong with this little guy...It was highly talked about by photo friends and I didn't go wrong buying it.","Ok","The vendor found the original packaging in their facility, so everything that was shipped from Canon was included with the camera body.  The manuals were printed in Spanish, and since I don't read, speak or understand much of it were of little value to me.  The English versions of the manuals were available on-line for down-load to print, which I did and that helped understand the camera  I've had the camera for about a month now, I believe, and read on below for my impressions.<br />  The body is perfect for bigger hands and weighs about the same as our original Rebel 35mm film camera, but physically appears to be much more robust.  It has some heft to it, but it's works well to hold with one hand to compose the pictures you take.  I think it is built to fit easily in the masculine hand.  The controls quite easy to use.  The controls are not touch sensitive like the Canon Power Shot SX50HS I got for my wife, which, for me has so many touch sensitive spots that I invariably brush over, and I need to reboot the camera to use it.  The SX50 has digital and optical image magnification and stabilization, that makes it easy to take digital pictures that are second to none.  The sensitivity of the buttons don't appear to bother her when she uses it.  I got the EOS 20D for my personal use.  When I take the time to actually use the camera for taking pictures, I will return with an update on picture quality and ease of use.<br />  As yet, I haven't taken any pictures, just looked through the view finder and focused on subjects to test the reaction of the lens for focus, which is awesome.  There is no view screen to view for composing your picture, and personally, I find the view screen an unhandy device, especially on sunny days when the sun at your back.  Using the eye-piece view finder, a little shade from the left hand, the view is perfect every time under all conditions.<br />  I've installed the lenses from my original Canon 35mm Film Camera, and everything works, both auto and manual modes.  I have installed an SD 1 GB memory card, which for the 20D camera is around 500 pictures at the settings I have selected.  I try to download and clear my camera more often than most, so 250 to 300 pix at a time on the card is plenty.<br />  Over all, I'd have to say that I'm pleased with the camera, the heft, the feel and the ease of operating control placement appear to be just what this 70 year old granddad needs.  I began pictures using a 1930's vintage Kodak Box Camera, and was thrilled with my first 35mm film camera.  As the summer progresses, I'm hoping things will slow down enough that I can actually use the camera.<br />  All that is missing, for me, is a comfortable, wide, camera neck strap.  A guitar neck strap is the strap of choice, but living in the middle of nowhere-South Dakota, makes the selection difficult.<br />  As I said, I'm satisfied with the appearance, I like the feel of the camera, solid and well built, and fits easily in a man's hand.<br />  If I can find my way back to this page, I'll add the quality and ease of operation as well as the quality of the pictures.  If it is as good ( it has a higher pixel rating than our original Rebel Digital) as the original digital, I'll be happy as getting grits, scrambled eggs, Jimmy Dean Sausage and Raisin or Rye toast for breakfast.<br />  I would recommend purchasing the 20D camera to a friend or relative (yes, even the ones I like) I'd encourage them to purchase the Canon EOS 20D camera, if for no other reason than how it feels in your hand and the view of your subject in the view finder, when holding it in the picture taking position.","I am a amateur photographer and enjoy taking pictures. I am very pleased with the image quality of the Canon 20D. I would recommend this to ANY beginning photographer. Now just need to get a really good piece of glass for it!","Bottom Line:  The Canon EOS 20D is still an outstanding digital camera, even a decade after it was first introduced.  Given current prices for a very good used model run in the $100-$200 range, there is no better way to start learning how to use a digital single lens reflex camera.  It is also a great secondary camera for experienced photographers.<br /><br />I've lost track of how many cameras I've owned over the years, in multiple formats.  When it came to DSLR cameras, I stuck with Canon because I had already been using EOS film cameras with the EF lenses.<br /><br />So lesson one for picking a DSLR--pick the lenses you want to use, not the camera body.  The lenses will last longer, and over time you'll find they are a sound investment if you buy good or better quality.<br /><br />The Canon EOS 20D was my transition into DSLR cameras.  The price for a new camera at the time had finally come to a point that was reasonable for the features I was wanting, performance was good, and memory cards held a large amount of data for a good price as well.  I couldn't have asked for more.  The 20D is a fully functional DSLR with every feature a photographer could ask for at the time, and even today performs well for the vast majority of photographers.<br /><br />Yep, even compared to my Canon 5D Mk III, the 20D still performs well.  Why?  Because a \"better\" camera isn't going to make you take better photos.  It just makes some things a bit easier.  And you'll never take a great photo with a camera you don't have in your hand.<br /><br />Sure, there are some bells and whistles on my 5D that make it out-perform my older 20D.  Biggest difference between the 20D and more recent DSLRs will be in how many megapixels are in each photo.  For professional photographers, this is a significant difference--you need more megapixels if  you're going to blow your photo up to poster or billboard proportions.  However, for most folks that will leave their photos on the computer, on facebook, or at most print an 8\"x10\"  so mom has something to put on the coffee table, 8MB is about as big as you need.  What's really going to count when it comes to making great photos is time spent taking photos.  Ten years later I'm still using my 20D, because it's the one I take with me on the road if where I'm going might have more of a risk of having my camera broken, lost or stolen...a 20D is quite reasonable to replace.  When travelling, I usually keep the Canon 2562A002 EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras lens on it unless I have something specific in mind.  Even if I'm using my 5D, I'll often have my 20D with me, mounted with a different lens, just in case I need to get \"that one shot\" and don't have the time to change lenses.  It is a sturdy, reliable, dependable workhorse.  It's also a forgiving teacher if you're new to the SLR world, with a wide range of functions that go from fully manual (where you have to set and adjust everything yourself) to fully automatic (where it does all that work for you).<br /><br />The 20D also has one thing going for it few other cameras can match.  It was made with astrophotography in mind.  The twin sister for the 20D, the 20Da, doesn't have a filter in front of the sensor so it can pick up more infrared light--but otherwise the two cameras are identical.  Main thing for most photographers is that the 20D has very low noise at higher ISO ranges; in fact, it compares best with the 60D and the 5D in that respect.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good, reliable camera that performs very well.  Megapixels might not be as high as some cameras out there now, but that isn't as much of an issue for most folks.  If you're looking for a camera to get started in DSLR, or you're looking for a second DSLR for a back-up...take a look at the Canon 20D.","The camera is in great condition and came with everything that would have been provided had I bought it brand new. I love my new camera and am enjoying learning photography with it. It captures beautiful images and I am very happy with it!","Before I begin, I would like to say that I have used far better cameras than the 20D. I work as a reporter, and we are lucky enough to have cameras such as a 5D Mark II in our camera pool with lenses to match.<br /><br />I was torn between purchasing this model and going with a rebel model, possibly the XSi. I'm glad I went with this model, though, as features such as the top display panel are features that I have gotten accustomed to having on my cameras. While the 20D has fewer megapixels (8.2 vs 10.1), and has the same max ISO (1600), it holds an advantage in frames per second (5 vs 3).<br /><br />This was the key stat for me, as I needed a camera that I could also use in a pinch for breaking news if I didnt have time to go back to the office for one of the better cameras. While I have only received my camera today, I have tried it out with several lenses so far and found it to be more than adequate for my needs.<br /><br />For the price I paid ($155 including shipping) and its capabilities, I give this camera five stars.<br /><br />Also, props to JoeTechCo. Ordered product Wednesday night, received in Friday around noon. For a used camera, hardly a scratch, nick or smudge on it.","The add stated the camera was in good condition and used very little.  When I opened the box I found everything sealed in its original packaging.  This camera had never been out of the box.  I couldn't believe it.  It was a state of the art camera when it was first sold and I feel it still is.  There are so many bells and whistles on it, it will take me years to learn how to use them all.  I use it only for astrophotography through a telescope.  What took me one hour to time expose an object on film, in the past, can now be caught in 15 seconds on its digital chip.  Great camera.","The Canon EOS 20d camera body only was a replacement for one we already had, it was exactly what we had been looking for. We were impressed with the prompt delivery, and the product was well packaged","I am used to the arrival of my purchases being two or three days and not more than a week but when I got the camera which is in exceptional condition and the great bag and the items that came in it, the wait was well worth it.  I got way more than what I paid for it.  Great seller and great buy for me.","Really? A hundred and fifty bucks used? A REMARKABLE deal for a \"starter\" digital SLR. The flashes on these puppies start to stick after a while - so? Buy a $30 Speedlite on Amazon. Problem solved. Lots of features, nice picture quality. Buy one if you find one for even $250. These are really popular cameras. Get yours while you can.","A great opportunity to acquire a second camera to keep in the car for all of those unexpected moments. The EOS 20D remains a great camera and goes well with the EOS 7D that is my other pet.","Beautiful pictures! I got one for myself and for my mom.  It's a little complicated for one who's never used one before, I suggest a thorough read through the manual and lost of experimentation.","I did a lot of research on Canon cameras before I decided on the Canon 20d SLR.<br />I like the flexibility the camera has. It allows me to have the option of being creative or merely point and shoot. The camera was as specified in the description by the seller.","great item arrived as described in great condition<br />shoots nice and not alot of wear .shutter has no issues<br /><br />thank you","The camera is in great working condition. As a student that goes to art school I really appreciated the price on this item. Also, the seller was very good. I asked for the camera to get here sooner and it wasn't a problem. Thanks!","My daughter saved her money for several months and did some research before finally purchasing this camera.  Unfortunately, the battery only lasts for a maximum of 10 minutes.  She gets frustrated that she can't take more than a few pictures with it before it dies.  Also, it did not come with a USB cord to download the images.  The camera itself seems to be great, it's just the battery life that is aggravating...","I purchased the 20d in Feb 2011, around 7 years after it was first introduced. The camera was so good built that it looked like new and seemed like it will last another 5 years. I bought it for less than $300 which was completely worthy of every bucks spent. This one is probably the cheapest used dslr you can find. However, remember that it was designed for semi-pro level photographers. It may lack some basic features found in modern cameras like live-view, recording video... The screen is also way too small but it's better than having no screen at all anyways. It is heavier compared to newer models but it is sturdy like a rock. If you are a beginner and looking for something to play with. Don't hesitate. It is the one for you. Spend less on the body so that you can invest more in lenses. Maybe in the next 2 years, when your skill is ripe, buy a better and more advanced body to go beyond the limitation.","The new canon \"upgrades for Rebels (xti series & up) were very disappointing. Incredible you can purchase good used 20d for 150 bucks. The secondary LCD screen is a critical aid to quickly adjust EV values among other adjustments... Something the new rebel series does not offer. The old XT was far better in many respects. Craming more pixels on an APS-C sensor is not my idea of an upgrade but a marketing ploy.<br /><br />Anyway, i'm real happy with my 20d. 5fps for action shots, a secondary LCD screen all for far less than the 50/60d which is the starting point for pro features buying new. Its ashame canon downgraded the Rebel..In many ways the old series was a pro model in disguise.<br /><br />Well worth it if you locate one in decent shape.","this was my first digital camera. it's simple enough to learn on and has great automatic and manufal functions to use as my needs become more complex","Why should you purchase this older canon model?<br /><br />~ It still takes great quality photographs, and at 8.2 megapixels, it still large enough to produce 24x30 inch image or even a little larger.<br /><br />~You can find the 20D on amazon or other classifieds for 400 dollars or cheaper, and amazing price for an SLR body!<br /><br />~I've owned this camera for over 4 years now, and it's NEVER let me down. Canon builds quality cameras, and despite me dropping it, taking it out in frigid weather, its barely shown signs of wear.<br /><br />~This camera still out-preforms newer nikon cameras in the realm of sport photography. It can snap off a burst of at least 20 photos in a couple seconds. I use it for hockey, football, soccer, you name it!<br /><br />~Be sure to check the sensor every so often for dust, I try to clean mine once a month or so to keep photos looking crisp and colorful.<br /><br />~Great in-camera settings (called parameters in the menu) let you control contrast, sharpness, saturation, and also control b&w or color modes. You get much better results doing it in-camera than in photoshop.<br /><br />~If you're looking to \"go professional\" and buying an SLR, but don't want to drop 900+ dollars on a canon rebel, try the 20D. It's an amazing camera!","Canon considers memory card capacity a deep dark secret.  You can look for it, but you won't find it.  The 20D will support an 8GB CF - MAX.<br /><br />You can buy a larger CF - but you can't write more than 8GB.  If you format it, you'll discover its size has been reduced to 8GB.  (You can use a partition editor like Linux's gparted to resize the partition table back up - but you shouldn't have to.)<br /><br />So stop eyeing those 16- and 32GB CF cards.  Since you're limited to 8GB, you can spend the difference on faster write speeds.  And more of them...","The 20D in my opinion is really the beginning of the cameras in the Canon line with really good image quality inherent in the sensors.  The 30D adds some bells and whistles including spot metering that the 20D doesn't have.  The 20D remains a capable camera and a good value if the limitations are suitable to you.  If not, the 30D offers a little more features and is also an excellent value among the models available today.","I have been incredibly pleased with my Canon 20D since purchasing it while serving in Iraq in 2005. The camera has taken some rough handling and done pretty well in various climates.<br /><br />From personal experience, it won't operate well when the temperature drops below 20 degrees or goes over 130. It's not waterproof. It isn't sand proof. However, it takes excellent, crisp pictures once you learn how to operate it and offers modes for both beginning and experienced photographers. I've used flash memory ranging from 512KB to 8MB with no problems despite having used various brands.<br /><br />I love my 20D and have used it to document many important events. Before that I used a 10D with equal pleasure. Now that the 30D and 40D have been released, the 20D should be available for a song.","This camera is certainly worth the step up from the Rebel if you truly want to get serious about photography as a hobby.<br /><br />- The build of the case is superb<br /><br />- The ergonomics are excellent, it fits right into your hands and all of the buttons are easily and intuitively accessible while you aim at your subject.<br /><br />- Camera is large and heavy enough for heavy telephoto lenses, whereas the Rebel feels complete unbalanced<br /><br />- There are just the right number of wheels/buttons for controlling aperture, shutter speed, metering, and focus points.<br /><br />- unlike the new Rebel, there is an LCD display on top so that the big screen on the back does not have to turn on to show you the settings.<br /><br />I am recommending this camera over the rebel for build and ergonomic reasons.  If you are going to be taking lots of pictures and putting a lot of effort into them, then this next step is completely worth it.","I recently decided to get serious about digital photography when I attempted to photograph my son playing guitar at a concert with a point and shoot digital camera.  I missed all of the great shots due to the delay in shooting that is inherent in most point and shoot cameras.  I became very interested in a more expensive setup when the Canon Rebel XT had a dramatic price drop to ~$800.  But after going to the store and holding it in my hand, it felt way too small and I didn't like the plastic feel of the camera.  To help me figure out which camera would be best for me, I determined my main areas of interest for photography and stuck to that while evaluating all possible cameras.  My main interests in photography are portraits and my kids' sporting events.  Because of this, I knew I needed something with burst capability and a fast write to disk capability, which this camera has.  I also wanted easy to access shutter and aperture controls that didn't require me to go into a menu to change - again, this camera is very easy to adjust and use in manual setting with controls for both right on the outside frame of the camera.  I'm new to both digital and film photography, but I've been having success in using the manual mode because I've read a couple of books on exposure and the controls on this camera are so easy to use.  In terms of support for portraits, I knew I needed a lens that supported an optical range between 85-105mm.  That didn't end up affecting my camera body purchase decision.<br /><br />This is going to sound very superficial, but I really liked the feel of the Canon 20D in my hand.  It is not too heavy, and it is very solid.  All of the controls are very easy to access and are intuitive.  Don't discount the importance of the feel of the camera in your hand.  If you do one thing in your search, be sure to go to a store and hold whatever camera you're thinking about purchasing in your hand.  Shoot a couple of shots in the store with it.  You'll be amazed at your reaction to simply holding the camera in your hand and the impact it can have on you.<br /><br />I recently joined a photography club at work and about 80% of the people in the club have this exact camera.  I purchased this camera before I joined the club.  I was amazed.  There is a lot of support for new users of this camera in the community - lots of books, videos, and clubs.  It's so helpful when you see demos that are based on your exact camera.  Don't get me wrong - there is a ton of support for Nikon cameras as well.  In fact, Nikon and Canon run neck and neck in terms of quality and continued improvement in their overall camera lines.<br /><br />I decided not to opt for the Canon 30D because it was more than I really needed, and to be honest, I wanted to save money for some really great lenses.  In terms of \"glass\" recommendations, I bought two lenses to start with - the EFS 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM (for portraits and every day shooting), and you can actually get this lens as an optional kit lens with the Canon 20D.  B+H Video in NY offers it with the body as a kit lens and I highly recommend this over the standard poor quality kit lens that is more commonly offered.  The other lens I purchased was the EF 70-200mm f/2.8L USM for shooting sports.  This is such a great lens - I can't say enough positive comments about this lens.  Worth every penny.  I highly recommend the Speedlite 580EX external flash for great indoor candids and excellent indoor portraits.  I point the speedlite at the ceiling and bounce the light to get very natural, diffused lighting.  Don't use the built in flash on this camera - it is not going to give you good results.  Your shots will look like normal point and shoot pictures if you use the built in flash.  Also, get at least a 2 GB memory card - the Ultra II SanDisks are the way to go because they have a fast enough write speed to support shooting sports.  I can fit about 450 JPEG-Fine shots on a single disk, which is more than enough for an amateur like me.  I'm going to move to RAW pretty soon once I learn the basics of Photoshop Elements 5.0, and I'll probably fit ~30% less shots on the disk, so I'll probably spring for a back up disk.<br /><br />I've shot at least 4000 shots so far with this camera since purchasing it on Labor Day of 2006 and have had no problems whatsoever.  It is a great camera body that I'm sure will serve me well for years to come.","I am just a hobbyist.  This was a big purchase and a big step for me to get into this level of camera.  I still haven't mastered using it yet, and I've had it for a few months.<br /><br />It does a wonderful job of taking pictures.  If you have the right lenses, it can take some of the most beautiful pictures you've ever seen.  Again, I'm just a hobbyist/enthusiast.  I use it to take pictures for work, too.<br /><br />I highly recommend getting a couple of VERY good lenses to go with it.  Don't go with the cheap lenses that Canon, Tamron, Sigma, etc. make for this camera.  Do yourself a favor and get a nice zoom - spend some bucks.  You'll be happy you did.<br /><br />The camera itself is pretty easy to use if you leave it on auto, but that's like buying a race car and never shifting out of first gear.  The auto settings are great, and they do a wonderful job, but you can do so much more if you learn to use the camera in Manual, Av, Tv, or P mode.  It allows you so much more creativity that you'll be amazed at the difference.<br /><br />The 30D came out right before I bought the 20D, and I would probably buy it for the price now, but I'm very happy with my 20D.","This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense.<br /><br />On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix.  It was two months before the camera was returned.  Sorry, Canon...  you lose a star for that.","This is my 4th digital camera. I keep upgrading as my skills get better. Finally on a SLR.<br /><br />I had read that the controls took getting used to. True it took me reading the manual to get them all figured out  DUH!  Straight out of the box I began shooting in automatic mode and the camera takes remarkable images. The focus at 100 percent can look a little fuzzy because of the anti-aliasing filter in front of the sensor but it is impossible to tell at anything less than 100 percent and sometimes not even there. You can zap it right out with unsharp mask in Photoshop. If you don't have at least Photoshop Elements get it. If you pay this much for a camera what is 70 bucks more.<br /><br />Out doors the camera is remarkable, indoors the white balance sucks bigtime but you can easily correct it especially if you are shooting raw. On the other side you have completely usable images even at 1600 ISO so that is great. Not much noise at all. 3200 starts to pick up a bit but is still better than some cheap cameras.<br /><br />So far about 6000 shots and no problems, nothing but praise for this camera. I have shot everything from flowers to faces, streetcars to sunrises and it has performed admirably.<br /><br />I have shot over 20,000 digital images now with all my cameras and I believe I will stay with this one for a long time. It exceeded my expectations.","i have owned this camera for well over a year now. and it has served me great!<br /><br />this camera has so much less noise than my original 1d, and has a great responce time. everything is near instantanious. and image quality is outstanding!<br /><br />however, stacked against the 1d mk IIn, it pales in comparison. but thats what you get in comparing a flagship camera to a prosumer camera. however, the battery in the 20d is much suppieor, and the camera itself is smaller and lighter. the images from the 20d acually show more detail, but they are also more likely to be off in some way, just by the nature of the camera. the 5fps is great for sports or fast action. however, it could use a larger burst rate for raw images, like the 10d precursor.","The 20D is wonderful for my photography business.  It is instant on and only takes a quick second to pull up previews of pictures.  Other digital cameras of the professional grade took too long to record the image before you could view it.  Sharp, quick, and flexible.  I would buy this camera in a heartbeat if I was still shopping for one!","I have been a Canon EOS user since film days (can we say those are nearly erstwhile yet?).  I always favored my RebelG because it did what it was supposed to do very well, every time, and predictably.  I also have some medium format cameras that are just fun cameras, such a twin-lens Rollei on 220 format.<br /><br />For the past two years, I've owned and used a Digital Rebel with the hand grip, and loved that camera, and the pictures it makes.<br /><br />Now, I feel like I was missing out on something that whole time because the 20D is all those cameras and a banana split to boot.<br /><br />I pulled the camera from the box and attached a 28-135 IS, and have been snapping away ever since.  The camera feels good in the hand and is easy to handle.  The new control styles will take Rebel users a while to accomodate as things are moved around a little on you, but the new control system is well thought out and intuitive on its own.<br /><br />Setting options on the fly is a breeze, and easier than with my Rebel because two options can be changed with each button.  The thumb wheel in the back controls one, and the finger wheel controls changing the other option.  For instance, to change the ISO, click the DRIVE-ISO button, and move your thumb on the back wheel.  Changing the drive is done with the finger wheel.  Slick.  Especially when you want to change a lot of options for a quick shot.<br /><br />EOS accessories work well, as expected.  So far, I have attached an ancient 50/1.8 EF (mk I -- the tank lens), the 18-55 EF-S, and the 28-135 IS.  Each of these lenses has worked as expected.  However, the viewfinder is so much brighter than my old Rebel, that even the lenses seem new.  I even used my Speedlite 380EX without hassle.  I don't think the 380EX supports TTL-II (the new metering system), but the exposures came out as I have expected them to be from years of EOS use.  Even better.<br /><br />Picture Quality is simply phenomenal.  Two years ago, I was astounded at how similarly my Digital Rebel responded as if it were film, but the 20D is not only like film, it's like perfect film.  What I mean is that is no matter what you shoot (ISO 100 to 1600 to H (3200)), the image responds the way you expect film would, but you don't have to worry about graininess caused by bad film processing, or from film getting hot, etc...  Shooting in H (ISO 3200) is cleaner than the old Fuji 800 I used to shoot.<br /><br />Now, looking through the viewfinder is a little different: the 9-point AF layout is new to any EOS camera I have handled.  The diamond shape is quite an improvement.  Plus, I have noticed that the camera gives more information than my Digital Rebel did.  There are AF points that dimly flash to show that an object will be in focus, but at the edge of the focal plane.  Bright points are in perfect focus.  It's a very nice addition to the usual feedback.<br /><br />The multipoint joystick located on the back of the camera makes it easier than ever to change AF points without getting out of the viewfinder, too.  Click the AF-point selecter button on the the far right and slide your thumb over to the joystick to move right to the AF point you want.  It couldn't be any simpler!<br /><br />ONE BIG DIFFERENCE!!!!  The shutter sound is totally different than my Digital Rebel.  It's louder, but sleeker sounding.  The 20D sounds like it is a film camera.  For people like myself, who enjoyed film shooting, it is handy to hear the mirror slap up and the shutter motor bzzzeeerrriiipppt!<br /><br />Setting the drive in continuous can be a bit startling, however, if you leave your finger on the shutter.  You can fire off 5 shots in a second, and it means it.  bam!  bam! bam! bam! bam!  What's funny is to hand the camera to someone who has never used an EOS and they will snap 10 pics.  Keep it in one shot if you have a mediocre CF card.<br /><br />Setting in-camera parameters is very, very, very easy.  One very nice addition to the 20D is the ability to make custom parameters, but also to tweak the white balance in the same way you can on the top of the line.  I haven't needed to do so yet, but I can see where it will be handy in mixed lighting (flourescent/incandescent).<br /><br />The bottom line is that there is really very little to hold you back from getting this camera, if you want a digital SLR.  The fit and finish is awesome (even down to the nice embossed logo on the flash -- so much nicer than the screen printed logo).  The styling is appropriate for an SLR (don't expect a light load if you add the battery grip, an external flash, and have a long lens).  The end result is spectacular!<br /><br />You should look into finding excellent printing resources to go with this camera.  I use a Canon Pixma at home, and one online service that has exceptional print quality.  The prints this camera can make will make you proud to see your friends and others gawking -- but be prepared to print more posters and large, large prints than ever.  It's kind of nice when 4x6 just isn't enough for some prints.<br /><br />The bottom line is a 5 for this camera.  Canon has made each feature work well.  It has provided durability (even in a 100,000 snap shutter).  And it works very very well for what it is.  No less than a 5.<br /><br />One more thing (I can't shut up about this camera, I love it).  The features of the camera mechanics themselves (such as the 1/8000 top shutter speed, and little things like 2-d curtain synch, PC synch for studio flashes, etc) are what you expect in a top-of-the line film camera.  Many of the similarly featured film-based EOS cameras used to price out around $1000.  Given that you never have to buy film or processing, this camera is a steal...  it really is.  I love it!<br /><br />If you want to shoot in low light, fast action, or plain old snapshots, this camera is for you.","Without doubt this camera is impressive.  The moment you put the 20D into your hands you feel at home with it.  The 20D just feels impressive and taking images with this camera is a joy, though more demanding than your normal point and shoot digital camera.  Getting to know your 20D will pay lots of dividends in the long run and I would suggest that owners of the 20D read the instruction manual and then read it again, while trying out all the many and varied functions.<br /><br />It is important with a digital SLR to choose quality lenses.  If you buy cheap don't be surprised if your resulting images lack the quality that they could command.  A quality flash gun like the 580 EX Speedlite will further help your image taking.  Furthermore, I find the BG-E2 Battery Grip - which holds an extra battery - an important accessory along with the Remote Switch RS-80N3 to minimize camera shake.  On the memory front, choose well!  Cheap memory can result in the loss of those precious images you have spent so long taking.  And make sure you have enough memory because an 8 MP digital SLR on RAW mode eats up images at an alarming rate.  Personally I have three 1 GB memory cards and still I don't think this is enough.<br /><br />Once you are set up with everything you will find taking images with the 20D brings you many hours, days, months and in the end no doubt years of fun.  The shutter is noisy making the 20D limited for wildlife work but when taking images of landscapes, people or my personal favourite, macro work, then this camera has the lot.  You get the build quality of Canon's professional cameras without the price tag.  The 20D is heavy, especially with the battery grip and a quality lens attached, so be prepared to use a tripod to help you avoid camera shake.<br /><br />This camera is beautiful and the little niggles I have over the focusing system etc have not stopped me loving the 20D to bits.","I was skeptical after switching from from film, medium format, which I have been using for close to a decade. It took a few weeks of playing to figure out how to get the best out of this great digital camera. I didn't get the standard zoom that is offered in the kit, but got the Canon 85, 1.8f USM lens instead. Old habits die hard. If you do a lot of available light shooting for portraiture, this lens can't be beat.<br /><br />Anyway, once I figured the camera out, I was satisfied with the results. Shooting raw images and using the Photoshop raw plugin yielded the best results.<br /><br />I don't mind being labled as  a Luddite for saying this, but as great as this camera is, it still can't do better quality images than the \"old school\" medium format camera that I still own.","Apart from all the good points rightly pointed by all reviewers there is one design problem with the camera: the LCD screen. It is simply too dim. To the point that is almost useless on a bright day. The quality of the pictures is great and the bundled software is very powerful and easy to use. Specially the Digital Photo Professional, that comes with no manual, is great. You can find an excelent tutorial here: [...].<br />Maybe that is why another reviewer complains about the images being too dull. I first tried the camera on an overcast day in Chicago and as almost everything is gray, the pictures at the LCD screen were quite ugly and flat. Very different from another cameras LCDs.","its a good choice as a back up camera to my 1Ds MarkII.the 20D's 8.2mp really do a good job.No comments der.","excellent in every aspect, even though couldn't get much affect changes between spot metering and evaluated metering whether in manual or auto, but alway get perfect metering","I have Canon 20D for just two months and took about 1000 pictures. After first two weeks, I found there were some spots on the sensor. Amazon changed a new one for me (very good service). After using for two weeks, there were some spots on the pcitures again. I probably changed lenses for about 7-8 times for the cameras. For some reasons, it seems to me that D20's sensor \"attracts\" dust easily compared with Digital Rebel (300D). I used 300D for 18 months, but I never have any problem like this.<br /><br />Please note that, there is a small section in the 20D manual (p36-37) descriing sensor clearing by selecting .... on manual dial....  but there is no sensor cleaning on 20D. Maybe the manual is just translated from Japanese manual and the function is not available for US version.... I am not sure.<br /><br />The sensor clearing fee is about $80 for Canon authorized prepair shop. D20 generates better pcitures than 300D. but for the sensor cleaning issue, I give it ***. I am really afraid changing lenses now since the sensor gets dust so easily. BTW, the blower does not really work for sensor.","All of those concerns about poor results with the built in flash are true -- I'm just an amateur who loves taking photos, for whom this was a first SLR of any kind.  So, I love fiddling with the options, and right now, black and white is my favorite mode.  This camera makes picture taking a joy, I don't have to miss that fleeting moment anymore  with the incredible number of continuous shots per second you can take.  But 1 week after buying this camera I had to invest in the speedlite 580EX flash, and I bought the EF-S 17-85 lens as well.  With those two additions, I can't take this camera anywhere without forethought.  So now, I've gone back to a sony cybershot p200 for all those family pix when we're just hanging out.  I would say skip the 18-55mm lens kit alltogether, since I was not impressed with the lens performance, and low light / indoor performance is much better with the 17-85mm EFS  for all purpose use if you don't want to do too much post editing.<br /><br />All things considered, 6 months later, I am planning on staying away from EF-S lenses in the future, since when I upgrade this camera a couple of years down the road, I want the lenses to be compatible with the full 35mm film size sensors of the EOS 1Ds Mark II equivalents.  I am beginning to love the picture taking power afforded by an SLR and would love to have access to true wide angle.  So if you don't want your $$$ to be wasted, stick to adding on L series lenses.<br /><br />I would not hesitate at this point in time to buy the 20D again, i.e. I wouldn't wait for the next latest greatest camera, and truly for my use at home and school activities this is more than I'd dreamed of being able to do.","Two months after purchasing the 20D, I'm happy with the quality of shots and of the body itself, but regretting buying a dSLR without spot metering.  (Live and learn.)<br /><br />The one disappointment that still bugs me about the 20D:  no spot metering for back-lit situations.  This often slows down getting a shot as the only work arounds are bracketting or manually readjusting for overexposing.  Yes, this can be a major pain, and \"perfect\" moment shots can be lost or have underexposed foreground subjects.  Folks who shoot mostly in studios really should not comment on spot metering!<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the partial metering like I was--it really doesn't make much of a difference over the evaluative, especially on human sized subjects!  The partial metering area is simply to big to catch a proper exposure in backlit situations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only way as of today, March 9, 2005, to get spot metering in a Canon is to buy a 1D (or 1Ds) Mark II, which is huge and much more expensive.  Nikon offers the feature on the D70, so consider carefully before investing in lenses!<br /><br />Other than this short-of-fatal shortcoming, the camera has few things to complain about.  Great images, custom functions, and ergonomics.  All things considered, I'm satisfied with the camera and have learned to work around the lack of spot metering (meaning as soon as I realize I'm in a back-lit situation I twirl to slightly overexpose--no matter how fast I twirl, however, spot metering would be faster and more efficient.)<br /><br />One point playing off a few other reviews regarding firewire:  In-body firewire and USB 2.0 are both virtually obsolete.  For less than $20 just buy a little CF card reader that plugs directly into a PC/notebook--with or without a cable.  Who wants to fiddle with a cable attached to a camera, particularly when traveling and setting up on the often cramped spaces in motel rooms?  Just pop out the CF card and stick it into the reader--this lets you drag and drop the files from the card to the PC instead of patiently letting them download out of the camera.<br /><br />Furthermore, using a card reader means you don't have to install the camera's clunky image download software--Windows 2000 and above handles the card readers automatically, dispaying the card contents just like they are on another drive.  And all the card readers come with drivers for Windows 98.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />A somewhat satisfied, and wiser-after-the-fact buyer.","Just wanted to add my hight marks for this camera (purchased trhrough Amazon). Feels much sturdier than the Digital Rebel. Great focus in low light. Love editing tools that come with the camera - especially correction of white balance in shots made in the RAW mode. I would strongly suggest a choice of high-end lenses for this camera (not the 18-55mm ...), preferably the L-series (I am using the 17-40mm L). Recommend shooting in only RAW mode, hence a 2GB card or greater is recommended.","The 20D is actually more responsive than my film SLR.  Start up speed is virtually instantaneous.  Almost no shutter lag.  Image quality is excellent with usable images up to ISO3200. Nice to have the 8MP for the extra cropping.<br /><br />Small quibbles but the controls are tricky to set the ISO and continous shooting.  On the other hand the menu system is very easy to use.<br /><br />Build quality is excellent, but small corners cut on the battery cover and compact flash cover. Also, the battery recharger does not have a cord.  Would be nice if battery could be recharged in camera.  USB 2.0 support but no firewire (what a drag for a camera of this level).<br /><br />The 20D has similar controls to the old Canon film SLR's.  I felt right at home after using my Canon A-1 (unfortunately a relic at this point).<br /><br />Camera is a little big and heavy, but that's part of the price to pay when you leave the amateur ranks.  The 20D gives you kudos among serious amateurs and semi-pro photographers.","The new Canon 20D raises the bar for digital photography at a reasonable price.  At 5fps and 8.2 megapixels it obviously puts Canon in a somewhat of a quandry, in my opinion.  With this speed and memory, the company should re-think its pricing of the Mark II which entered the market at a high price.<br /><br />Additionally, the competition is hurrying to introduce a quality product in a modest price range.  Frankly, I'm not reading much from the others!  Since Canon has introduced the 20D, this marks the third digital they've introduced in 18+ months.  It seems to me the other manufacturers are still trying to get out of turn three, while Canon already has crossed the finish line.","ALL OF MY OTHER CAMERAS LOOK AND FEEL LIKE POO! My other cameras now feel so sad and pathetic... it's unbelievable. Why didn't I get the 20D months ago?<br /><br />For the $1500 price range there is no better camera that money can buy.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for?<br /><br />-Get it or be envious.","The camera is top of the line--no regrets here, except...I have purchased from B&H Photo Video (online)before and did not have a problem.  My Husband placed a very big order for my surprise gift, and it turned into a nightmare for both of us. Maybe it's a fluke accident, hey it happens to the best of us, but the customer support service was TERRIBLE.  After he placed an online order using his debit card, it automatically withdrew the amount from his bank. To confirm the order he called them...it took talking to 3 or 4 different people to actually locate the order, because according to them the order does not exist (remind you, that  amount was already withdrawn from his account). It took them 4 days for the $$$ to be credited to his account.  He wrote them a dissatisfaction email...but no response.  This was a large order too over $2,300, so you think a company would do anything to keep a customer: maybe reenter the order for them, or atleast apologize and offer a discount, but they chose to ignore that this was actually their mistake.  In the age of so many photography businesses and so much competition, their blatant indifference for making such a large sale shocks me. As a business owner myself, I'd say I would do everything in my power to leave a positive impression of myself and my company. Obviousle B&H Photo Video has grown their ego to such extent that they don't care if they lose customers.  We will not be return shoppers here. Instead the Canon 20D was purchased from Amazon and it was shipped the same day!","This camera has been reviewed to death so i'll be brief. I needed this for wedding photos. The Digital Rebel was slow to start and come out of 'sleep', buffer was tiny, slow to save pictures to CF card, had no PC Sync port, had occassional focus problems, plasticky body. The 20D solves almost all those problems. low light focusing still needs infrared/flash help, but the buffer is LARGE, file saving is FAST, and this makes for a great all around pro-sumer camera body.<br /><br />Only gripe is that mirror is tiny and for those of you (like me) used to bigger mirrors from film 35mm cameras...yo'ull find the light coming through the viewfinder is MUCH dimmer. this makes manual focus all but impossible in low light situations.<br /><br />i'd get this again in an instant. if you have the extra $, get the vertical grip.","This camera is the absolute best you can get for the price.  It's sturdy, durable, has excellent resolution, and is under $2,000.  It produces excellent images and has the highest resolution in its category.  Over all this is an outstanding machine.","I was a 10D user for about 1.5 years.  The 10D takes great pictures so why bother upgrading right?  Well, now that I have messed around with the 20D a bit it was clearly the right choice... although not totally perfect.<br /><br />The useful improvements for me have been 1. Faster time from turning on the camera to taking a picture.  It's virtually instantaneous.  The 10D took a few seconds to get going.  2.  Faster writing to the CF card.  This feature is nice when you are in a hurry to take several shots and then get the pics to your computer.  3.  Built-in black and white mode that allows for photo filters to be digitally applied in camera with pretty darn good results.  Although I prefer to apply filters in Photoshop.  4.  The taller pop-up flash works better with my 17-40mm canon lens.  The 10D would leave a half circle blackout between 17-24mm due to the top of the lens blocking the flash.  The taller pop-up flash shoots right over it.  5.  Super low noise at ISO400 and ISO800.  It's even pretty good at ISO1600.  With ISO expansion on you can go to 3200 but it was pretty grainy.  My 10D shows noise at 400 and above.<br /><br />Things I didn't realize were going to happen:  My digital workflow is a bit messed up now.  I usually shoot in RAW, and I use the Macintosh OS to process images.  Image capture application in MAC OS 10.3.5 does not support the raw files (now .CR2 files instead of .CRW files in the 10D).  10.3.6 update now allows image capture to recognize the .CR2 files, but it won't build previews for them.  That means you have to use a file browser to manage the files.  iPhoto will not read the .CR2 files.  The new Camera Raw Plug-in (v2.3) for Photoshop CS supports the 20D images (but is not on the list of supported cameras.)  So I now use the Photoshop CS filebrowser to look at my files and figure out which ones are good.  However, I still can't build icon previews for the .CR2 files so it's a bit hard to find the pics you want in a file folder.  I make contact sheets for each shoot and store them with the raw files.  None of these problems exist if you shoot in any of the .JPG modes.<br /><br />My top five good things and my one bad thing.  I'm sure the one bad thing will go away after the camera has been out a while and becomes more popular.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who's graduated from their Digital Rebel and is wanting more.<br /><br />3-2-05 **** update:  iPhoto now supports .CR2 files directly from the camera or a CF card reader.  You can drag them to your photoshop icon in the doc to edit the original or you can set a preference to have the jpg preview from iPhoto open in photoshop with a double click.  iPhoto, image capture, Digital photo professional, phtoshop CS, photoshop 7, photoshop elements 2, 3 still will not build icon previews viewable in the finder for .CR2 files as of this update.  At least iPhoto will allow me to browse photos without having to open them in DPP.","I've only had this a few days and I consider myself slightly beyond beginner. First, it is easy to understand overall. I was using only the LCD viewer before and this camera ONLY allows the eye viewfinder in taking pictures. It turns off the LCD for the actual photo, something I have to get used to again but is a better way to take a picture to avoid stray light problems. Fortunately, the viewfinder has adjustments for near-sighted folks like me and it is bigger than in my other cameras, a plus.<br /><br />I thought a camera producing photos of high quality would be more complex - this is not. I wish I could turn the flash off in combination with macro in automatic mode, though - but no such ability. At any rate, the macro pictures with the flash were fantastic. The lenses are the best. I've had no problems with the picture quality using flash. Other flash accessories are available if the built-in one doesn't suit you or use the flash settings - they are not difficult to learn. And get the EF-S 17-85mm lens instead of the default one. It's worth every penny for the anti-shake ability alone.<br /><br />Second, the 8.2 mp pictures are the best for a camera in this price range or lower. I had done much research before purchasing the 20D. Other cameras doing 8 mp or less have issues that the 20D does not have. This is a little treasure that I plan to use for years.","I owned the D30 before this camera, which I loved and had no problems with.  I upgraded to the 20D and enjoy the speed, but pictures using the internal flash are often underexposed.  There are many discussions on the Internet about this problem.  Some people have exchanged the cameras several times before getting a good one, others argue it's a pro-level camera where the user should manually adjust everything first (why have an automatic mode then?).<br /><br />I'm not a pro and just want a fast camera with interchangeable lenses that works well in automatic (and P-mode).  I don't want to have to fiddle with a bunch of settings just to get a good flash shot.<br /><br />I wish Canon would address this issue (perhaps something to do with the DIGIC processor?).","I purchased the 20D as an upgrade from my Digital Rebel. The cost was certainly worth it.<br /><br />This camera has many, many advantages to the Rebel (as I'm sure other reviewers will point out), but I thought three were worthy of mention:<br /><br />ISO 1600 and 3200 have very, very low noise. This means that I am now able to get low-light shots that I never could before. For example, I often take pictures of crowded streets at night. Before, I needed to use a flash or else my shots would be blurred by camera shake and the motion of people walking. Now (with the help of a f1.8 lens) I can set the camera at ISO3200 and have the shutter speed be fast enough that I can get clear images. In fact, when I use the Black & White mode, the picture is virtually noise-free.<br /><br />Rapid-Fire burst mode. When the \"multi-shot\" function is on, this camera fires like a machine gun. It also writes the images to the memory card much faster than the Rebel ever did. I shot a series of 25 shots in 5 seconds, and it still had them all on the card 6 seconds after I stopped shooting.<br /><br />Black and White mode. Not just some toy feature, when you are saving as a JPG file (not RAW), the image is actully encoded as a B&W image--meaning a smaller file size. This means more shots per card, and also more shots being able to be held in the buffer. I was actully able to record 90 frames of B&W images (JPG-Large-Fine) at full speed (5 per second) without stopping (onto a 40x CF card).<br /><br />Like I said before, I'm sure there are tons of other amazing features of the 20D, but I wanted you to know my favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE: Over the past few months, there have been reports that the 20D locks up on occasion. I had that happen to me only once. Canon has posted a firmware upgrade on it's website that remedies this problem (as well as a few others). I upgraded, and have not had any problems since.","This replacement to the 10D certainly delivers the goods. It is more like the 1D Mark II than the Digital Rebel. It writes very fast to the CF so it will take advantage of high speed cards -- I can barely notice any hit to the CF card when recording RAW files (amazing). Startup time is super quick (0.2 seconds), as is AF. Pictures are amazing even at high ISO ratings (1600 is actually not very noisy). Of course, it is a true Digital SLR, so you can exchange lenses to fit your needs and you have very fine control over how pictures are taken. As for SLRs, It does have a set of \"basic\" modes which help grab quick shots or allow novices to use the camera like a \"Point and Shoot\" camera. In addition, the Creative Mode (Advanced) let you take control of the pictures. RAW conversion is not bad, but not great either. I usually just use the Canon RAW conversion software to export to TIFF and go from there with another program. What is nice, you can have the camera record RAW and JPEG versions of each shot at the same time -- so the JPEG gets the immediately gratification and quick viewing and the RAW allows the finer control and no loss of data. Highly recommend this camera and being one of the first (few) pro/sumer DSLR to make 8.2 MP sensor -- it's a no brainer. My only complaint is you cannot record RAW or RAW+JPEG in Basic modes (only JPEG). Even at full retail price, it is a good value.","Is the EOS 20D all it's cracked up to be? After using it a couple of days I have to say yes. What makes it so amazing?<br /><br />My top reason, LOW NOISE even at ISO 1600. At ISO 3200 it will create a photo that is ok if you run it through Neat Image. (a free noise reduction program)<br /><br />Here are some of the other reasons I love it. Excellent quality images. Virtually NO shutter lag, instantly starts up from standby, shoots 5 frames per second. I was able to shoot 32 continuous frames set at 8mp fine using a 1GB Lexar 80X CF card. It has simple to use menus. Very fast to focus (I used a Sigma 24-135mm lens.) The built in flash is good. It has a solid feel; it's light but not too light. Battery life is great; you can set it to go to standby after 1 min because it starts instantly when you press the shutter release.<br /><br />I have tried to find something I can complain about but I can't. This camera is great!!!! At the price it is in a class by it's self. This is minor but the camera raw software is so so. I'm sure Adobe will update their camera raw plug-in for Photoshop before too long."]},{"name":"Pentax Optio S50","amazon_reviews":["Needed a small, inexpensive camera to have in my car at all times.

What I liked most was the ability to customize my photograph according to light condition, object, etc...if I wanted to, or just use the auto setting feature of the camera.  If you want a certain shot to come out a certain way and you are confident that you can do that, then this camera will allow you to do that.  If you don't want to mess with that, then just use the auto setting that will balance everything out.  The pictures are clear, crisp, and well lit.  The flash is great.  Just keep in mind that there is a small delay between picture taking.  The SD card slot is easily located, battery life is excellent.  Another good point is the small size:  small enough to fit in your pocket, and use only one hand to take pictures if you want, but still large enough so that even large hands like mine (size XXL gloves)can access the buttons clearly, evenly, and without mistakes.

Skimming the manual, if not reading it entirely, is strongly suggested to get the most out of this camera.  After that, it's a snap.

I liked the size of the camera, Pentax name and claimed battery life.  I think the color reproduction is ok, but not great, and the picture clarity is ok, but not great.  Using 2400 mAh recharageble batteries made this camera almost useless.  Since almost every shot requires a flash, I only would get 30 or so pictures before needing to switch batteries.  And since NiMH batteries loose charge when not in use, I would find the batteried dead if I left the camera a few day.  I have since purchased some 1400 mAh, Li-ion CRV3 rechargeble batteries.  These are a must for anyone with this camera.  I can't tell you how many pictures it gets per charge, because after 2 weeks it is still on the first charge, and has not even dropped from the full charge indicator!  This is several hundred pictures, viewing and deleting pictures on the camera and transfering the picutes to a computer.  As a bonus, since the CRV3 battery supplies a full 3V, the flash charges about twice as fast.  (NiNM AA batteries are only 1.3 V each)<br /><br />The main problem with the camera is how incredibly slow it is.  This camera is mostly used to take pictures of our kids, and kids do not sit still enough for this camera.  Every aspect of shooting a picture is very slow.  The other draw back is that this camera needs a lot of light, and the flash doesn't help for anything more than a few feet (about 10 or so) away.  Outside shots are usually fine if the sun is at least partially out.<br /><br />I am currenly looking for a faster digital camera, with a bigger lens to help in low light situations.","Bought this camera about 6mo ago. After ~2GB of pictures:<br />1. Decent quality - you gotta understand that it is not SLR so for a compact it is OK. Viewing 100% size shows no visible defects.<br />2. Really small - important since what good is your camera if it stays at home most of the time. That one fits in the pocket, but you'll feel it there.<br />3. Takes AA batteries - good thing just in case<br />4. Has multiple modes and settings - not too useful, but it doesn't hurt either.<br />---------------<br />Now for what could be better:<br />1. Slow as you would not believe shooting @5MP and best resolution. When this red light is blinking (writing to card) you can't do anything and it lasts forever.<br />2. Slow in general - takes too long between you push the button and the picture being actually taken. Pple turn around, move out of frame and so on.<br />3. Buttons are tiny - well, the camera is tiny too, but still...<br />If you plan to use gloves or just have large hands - forget about it.<br />4. Battery usage - I use rechargable 2400mAh ones and they don't last too long. Indoor shots almost always use a flash so battery indicator goes yellow after about 20-30 shots no matter how you recharge your batteries (there are different ways to do it)<br /><br />Conclusion: It is worth the price if you need really small camera to take anywhere and want to stick with the combination of SD storage and regular AA batteries","after some extensive research I purchased the Pentax Optio S50 over a Kodak or Cannon.  I paid the msrp of $289 and that was about $40 cheaper than the Cannon Elf SD200(the Cannon was 3.2MP vs the 5MP on the Pentax).<br /><br />Im very happy with the Optio S50, its a very small camera, solid construction, easy to use with lots of extras for the more advanced photographer.  Also takes video with sound, my 256MB SD card can take 10 minutes of continuous video....","I bought the Pentax S50 last December. I already own a Nikon 5700 but I was looking for a camera that I could:<br /><br />a) take anywhere, and<br /><br />b) take scuba diving<br /><br />With its compact size and available underwater housing (and even supported \"marine\" modes) the Pentax seemed to fit the bill. I was actually undecided between the S50 and the Casio Exilim, so I actually ran a side-by-side comparison of the two. The S50 lost out in almost every discipline, the most important being picture quality (even though I was comparing to a 3MP Z30!), which I actually found to be quite poor on the S50. Apart from this, I was disappointed by the LCD screen, which was smaller and far less sharp than the Casio's, the larger size (although not by much) and the general build quality - the buttons, flaps and doors just felt cheap compared to other cameras.<br /><br />On the positive side, I did like the idea of being able to use standard AA's, but when you consider the amazing battery life of today's ultracompacts, it's really not an advantage. I was also impressed by the incredible array of features and options that the S50 packs in - unfortunately, these don't make up for the poor picture quality. My advice would be to choose a Casio Exilim. If price is an issue, get the Z30 or Z40 - you will still get better pictures.","this is a great little camera. i bought it because of its size. it has some great features like being able to reduce the file size photos stored on it. panoramic assist is good and its very easy to use. it has some drawbacks too. red eye reduction always has to be used. the pictures are quite dark in low light settings and my biggest problem, low battery life. it uses 2 AA batteries. the rechargable batteries that came with it were charged for 12 hrs as recommended. i only got about 90 pictures out of them (16 were with<br /><br />flash). it also takes a while to write the images to the disk( even with the enhanced SD II card)<br /><br />but i still think its a great camera.","Really good Camera.

Excellent features and beautiful size and looks.","It all started at the Chrismas boat parade party in Huntington Harbor, CA. I noticed this guy with a small camera taking pictures across the room. I could see the viewfinder screen from across the room, and it was clear. I just had to see that camera up close. The user was from Hong Kong, where everything is knocked off and relatively less expensive than the US. That impressed me, because, not only was the user very knowledgeable about cameras, he owned a fairly large company and could afford any camera. Why did he pick Pentax? I looked the camera over, he let me take some shots. I made a quick decision, I had to have one. The camera just felt good in my hand. That night I found a new one for $219.00 on the inet and bought it from a new camera discounter. (Buy Digital)<br /><br />OK, now I have it, what do I think? I think 5 stars. 5 MP, operates on 2 AA batteries, huge LCD RGB quality viewfinder, quality metal construction, no flimsy doors like the Canon SD300, no red eye, easy to understand and operate controls, fantastic pictures, flash works for more than 6 feet away, pictbrige photo transfer. The only negative is it does not come with a memory card, you have to buy one. The camera comes with 11MB, built in. I might mention that I also have a Nikon D70, I tend to grab the Pentax first, it's much easier. I'd love to see a comparison between this camera and the highly reviewed Canon SD300.<br /><br />Reviews are important before buying a camera, but if an educated camera enthusiast from Hong Kong says good things about a camera, especially, if a bargain price is not an issue, it meant more to me than 15 Canon reviews. My observation proved to be accurate. If you don't believe me, buy on, if you don't think it's excellent, keep the box and resell it on Ebay.","I bought this camera as my first digital camera.  its simplistic design and 5mp are what turned me on to this product.  when i got it home and started to play with is i realized it had an abundance of features that i didn't notice at the store.  it can take point and shoot pictures easily, it has a manual focus override, and you are able to take black and white or my personal favorite black, white and red!  these are just a few of the features on this relatively inexpensive camera.  to top it all off it takes really really good high resolution pictures that you'll think were taken by a professional."]},{"name":"Kodak DX7590","amazon_reviews":["great product  has a few dings in it from use but other than that every thing works great only problem is the flash bulb may have went out but other than that I absolutely love this product","It was twelve years ago when I bought this camera, the first digital camera I ever owned.

Transfer of data is as simple as connecting a cable to your computer or removing the SD card and inserting it in a reader.","great deal and service","Sorry I'm late posting this.  The camera works great.  Just like new.  It's a replacement for an identical cam I had that broke.","I love this camera.  It is my second one.","Still have it and it works will. Take very beautiful photos","Love these cameras.","great product  has a few dings in it from use but other than that every thing works great only problem is the flash bulb may have went out but other than that I absolutely love this product","It was twelve years ago when I bought this camera, the first digital camera I ever owned. I had been shooting 35mm film for years.<br />I have had a bunch of digital  cameras since then. I recently took a second look at this little Kodak and was surprised at how many features it has and the quality of pictures it produces.<br />The camera works as well today as it did twelve years ago.","Still a great camera and can  be bought on ebay for $50 (give or take).  While I use my cell phone camera a lot I still like this camera and find the 5 MP pictures more than adequate for most situations.

Not good for movies, but I use it as  picture camera.Only takes 2 GB Max SD cards, but at 5 mp it's ok. Battery life is outstanding, and speed of shots are adequate 1 every about every 2 sec (with flash). Very clear , sharp images, good color saturation, no complaints. Like ALL cameras an extra flash for poor lighting situations needed for a good night pic.I bought one recently to replace my 8 y/o DX 7590 camera that was submerged in sea water getting of a snorkeling trip on vacation.","Not a bad little camera with plenty of enhancement products still available for purchase.  Although not state-of-the-art, this little camera does the job for the casual user, incorporating the basic features most wanted.  It gives the appearance of being a \"better\" semi-professional camera without looking overly complex. Recommended for the beginning photographer who wants the option for something delivering both point-and-shoot technology and manual photography tweaking.","I have had this camera for years now and it has been the best camera I've owned so far. It has a bunch of settings such as 'distant landscape', 'bright beach scene', 'portraits', 'night scenery', etc. It takes great photos and zooms pretty well for a little camera. I use it mainly to take beach, boat and sunset pictures and I have received countless compliments. The pictures come out best when you use a tripod to hold it steady but that is really my only complaint!","This camera was in excellent condition when I received it. I have two other cameras identical to it that we use in our other offices and it works just the same. My only complaint is that the toggle button in the center sticks a little, but it's not a big deal.","Great price for the product. Seller provided the necessary information before the purchase of the Kodak EasyShare DX7590 Camera and Dock Bundle.  Had a need for existing Kodak printer to work with this camera and dock.  Kodak tech support was not very good in assisting me with this challenge.  This seller was efficient in the product they sold.","I LOVE THIS CAMERA AND THE SELLER SEND ME ALOT OF STUFF THAT I DIDNT EXPECT TO GET. THANK YOU. LOVE IT","I buy my camera to take picutre for the church i go to so<br />for the picture come out nice I realy like kodax Easy share","Hi,<br />I already own a camera just like this one and love it. Bought this one for my son, plan to buy one for my daughter later for her b-day. Only thing missing on this model is the stablization, but can do with out most of the time. It's a great camera and I love using it. I get really great photos and can zoom up on the image alot and still get great quality!!!! I looked at the newer cameras, but I wanted a viewfinder to look through and some of the newer models don't have a viewfinder, which drove me up the wall.<br />Love this camera!!!!!A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++","I conducted several tests against Canon and Nikon lenses.  I don't know how or why but the Schneider KREUZNACH Varigon came out on top!  The low pixel count requires working-around, but no big deal.","I live in a small town and am kind of the resident camera expert and have bought digital cameras online for about 25 people. I have owned this model of Kodak camera (twice, in fact - have now upgraded to a DSLR) and have bought it for about 5 of my friends. It is a great camera.  It takes very sharp, clear outdoor photos with excruciating detail.  It does a better job than most, indoors with a flash.  Very vibrant colors. It's quite fast and has good flash range and recharge time.  It has 10x optical zoom which isn't stabilized, but I never had any problems with blurring, even at maximum zoom range (granted, I am quite good at holding a camera steady).<br /><br />Kodak has one of the easiest to use menus in the business and this one is no exception. I am also a fan of the joystick design which makes navigating a \"joy\". This camera is practically indestructible.  It seems to be faster and takes better photos than the newer models that Kodak has put out lately (z712, a612).  I even liked this model better than the P850 which is supposed to be their professional model, but it is much heavier and doesn't have anything on the dx7590 in the performance department. I keep recommending this one to people over and over again. I only held back one star because of the grainy lcd (the photos are never grainy - just the screen) and very slight amounts of softness in some images - which is very typical of Kodak. Overall, it's one of the best cameras I've owned - and I've tried almost every brand and model out there.<br /><br />It's interesting to me how a camera company can get some models right and others are not so good. This one was a winner.","There are a couple of \"minor\" quirks of this camera but let me say first that it's one of the best 5mp \"near-SLR\" DCs on the market.<br /><br />First quirk:  In video mode, the zoom is disabled.  Being able to zoom in and out in movie mode is basic and I'm not sure why this camera doesn't support it.  But, it's a DC not a camcorder.<br /><br />Second quirk:  If you buy the 58mm adapter so that you can put a protective filter over the lens, the built in flash gets cut off by the collar and the pictures  are dark in the lower half.  If this is a problem, keep the stock lens cap on and be a little more careful with the lens.  Flash can be solved with a \"head 'n handle\" flash unit (from $10 on ebay).  External flash connection was a BIG selling point for me.<br /><br />This camera has become my light meter for my film SLRs.  Instead of taking readings, I use the bracketing function +,- EV to find the best looking shot on the large, bright viewfinder/screen.  Click on \"Info\" and see exactly what fstop and shutter will expose that old-fashioned and expensive 35mm film perfectly!","Let me begin by saying, I'm not a professional. I take photos for fun and to record events in my life. However, with this camera, I have been able to take some amazing photographs that I'm truly proud to show to friends.<br /><br />The zoom is phenomenal and was the reason that I upgraded from my previous camera that had only a 10x zoom. This zoom has allowed me to take great photos from spectator stands and at shows that would have looked ridiculous with a camera with a smaller zoom capacity.<br /><br />My favorite feature is the close-up feature which has allowed me take some stunning photos of my flowers and of birds roosting on my feeders. I've consistantly found my photos to have vivid coloring and crisp details which is something my other cameras lacked.<br /><br />For the amateur that wants to take fantastic photos that makes your friends say, \"Wow!\" this is a great camera. The only issue I've had with the camera is taking photos of heavily lit situations at night such as Christmas light displays, etc. No matter what setting I used, the photos still came out a bit unfocused.<br /><br />However, everything else is superb. A fantastic buy.","I purchased this camera in October 2004 and have been using it now for 16 months. I have to say that I am thoroughly pleased with this product. I am a professional graphic designer, and I have used it to take photos that wound up being used in printed national magazines. Everything good about this camera has probably already been said in the other reviews (excellent picture quality, long battery life, good software support, etc.).<br /><br />My only complaint would be that there are times when it asks for the flash to be popped up (it's not automatic) in scenerios when I would have thought there was enough light. Also, if you've owned this camera since it's early introduction, make sure you get the downloadable firmware update from Kodak's web site--it fixed some issues I experienced earlier with focusing in indoor photos.<br /><br />UPDATE: In July 2006, I purchased a SanDisk Ultra II card for my Kodak DX7590, because I was hoping that it would be faster than the original SanDisk 512MB. But to my surprise, it timed exactly the same. So I emailed Kodak, and this was their response: \"We appreciate your interest in high speed memory for your digital camera. Our cameras are designed to operate, write and read SD cards at set voltage speeds. Therefore, there is no advantage to using faster memory in Kodak cameras.\"<br /><br />So if you use the Kodak dock to transfer images to your computer, there's no advantage to paying extra for a high-speed SD card. However, if you use a card reader to get images to your computer, then it might be worthwhile to pay a little more for the Ultra II since read and write speeds through the reader will be much faster.","I bought this camera in Sept. of 2004 and it has lived up to my expectations fully. I have not had any problems with it and I have used it a lot. It takes great pictures and is very easy to use. The battery life is super strong. My camera battery has never even come close to going dead on me, and i've been out and about for hours taking lot's of pictures at a time. As well as it being a 10x optical zoom (the real deal)it has a very nice 38-380mm zoom lens and also has two accessory lenses and three filters that can be purchased for it. I cannot think of any cons about this camera, except that it would be about perfect if it had built in image stabilization or a cable release button. But to help counteract that, use a good tripod and make sure that your focus is locked. The more you practice with this camera the better the pictures you'll take. And remember, with any camera you have to take a lot of pics to get the good ones. With digital it is so nice because you can instantly see how your pics are going to look. I am impressed with Kodak and I highly recommend the Kodak EasyShare DX7590 for anyone who wants a really nice digital camera at a very affordable price. Now is a great time to buy it too as the price has come down considerably from when I purchased mine.<br /><br />UPDATE 12-1-08:<br /><br />I now have had this camera for 4 years. It is a great little camera, especially for the price. I've taken hundreds of pictures with it and have had no problems. One thing though is that you have to make sure that your focus is locked in. Partially press the shutter button twice to lock it in. Make sure your lighting is also adequate. I stand by what I said 3 years ago and I highly recommend the DX7590. Kodak cameras are really good little cameras.","I love taking black and white pictures and this camera does it for me.  I'm still playing with the sepia, practice makes perfect.  The zoom is awesome. I'm outdoors alot and enjoy taking nature pictures.  I enjoy experimenting with different shots with this camera. Recommend buying a large memory card if you're shutterbug and an extra battery.","Ok lets face it, this is not a high end pro camera.<br /><br />However for the price it's quality plus features and accessories would be hard to beat!<br /><br />I had an 8x10 print made from a 5mp w/ fine res. setting (CVS Kodak Kiosk) printed, and was very pleasantly surprized at the exellent quality obtained.<br /><br />Untill the megapixels become standard at 25 to 30mp (equiv. to 35mm film on a pro camera lens combo with fine grain film), and the prices are in this price range, I dont plan to upgrade.<br /><br />So for the next couple or few years (should the camera last that long) this model will serve me as a convienient snapshooter.<br /><br />I do reccommend also purchasing the 55mm filter adapter for this camera, it will provide many options as well as protect the lens.<br /><br />This camera I find better suited for outdoor shots than indoor, the  built in flash is not very strong (I use an external flash with flash bracket)and the camera does not have low light assist to aide in autofocus. The settings you use will greatly affect your result as with most digital cameras.<br /><br />Overall - a lot of bang for the buck (well worth the price).","I wanted to wait a couple of years before buying a digital camera where I would get the benefits of price reduction, features, value, and better than average (over 3.2mp) MP quality.<br />So my first digital was the Kodak DX6490.  I found the Kodak DX6490 very easy to use, and packed with features I would use, such as the MPG recording (limited to the size of your external SD card), which allows you to email clips (very cool!!).<br /><br />Then before you know it, less than 6 months later Kodak comes out with the DX7590.<br /><br />The first thing I like about it over the DX6490 is the turn switch.  It's much more smooth and doesn't need to have too much pressure applied to it.  I found myself skipping the setting I wanted on the DX6490 dial because of the amount of pressure I had to apply. It also features nearly a dozen more scene modes!<br /><br />Other things I like about it are the internal memory capacity of 32MB, which has doubled over the DX6490's 16mb internal memory size - and the extra mega pixel move from 4.0 on the DX6490 to 5.0 on the DX7590.<br /><br />I haven't found on any other digital cameras in the 5.1MP range. Good battery life, excellent picture quality outdoors, compact and fun to use, cool design, large 2.2\" LCD display (can't find that on most digital cameras), good software, 10x optical zoom, and as I mentioned before it records video clips.<br /><br />Battery life has been excellent and I would take quite a bit of pictures (75-120 pics at times) between docking the camera again. However, there is no recharger aside the base (docking station) the camera comes with. So, if you plan on going on vacation, you'll need to take it with you (power cord, base, and the USB if you're going to want to transfer your pictures to a computer).<br /><br />Manually controllable \"EasyShare\" is kind of an oxymoron. Generally, its feature set is useful, but it has some annoying gaps.<br /><br />Transferring pictures via the docking station works seamlessly, however there are a few annoyances such as the wait period for the card to be read on the memory card.  Getting the Ultra SD card will solve that problem.<br /><br />Convenient external controls provide quick and easy access to frequently used functions, such as the self-timer and the continuous-shooting mode. When you enter a mode, the camera briefly explains it on the LCD.<br /><br />Overall it is a good 1st time camera, and I give it a 9 out of 10 rating. It could be a 10, but I think that would push it into the $699 price range. You can buy this unit for about $300 at most retailers. Costco wholesale warehouse was selling it for $349.99 with the dock.  Prices continue to drop as the technology improves. This used to cost close to $500!<br /><br />[...].<br /><br />Megazoom maniacs will over it because of the super zoom.  Great camera and it takes wonderful pictures.  Not to mention the Schneider Kreuznach lens.<br /><br />For a more thorough description you can look it up on CNET.","You can charge the camera's batteries disconecting the cable from the DOC. It's easy to use, and you can save some \"basic\" videos with sound. As a camera is excellent, the prints are excellent also when you print in large size.","First of all let me say I am very satisfied with the performance of this camera.  Since the other reviews do a very good job of describing the pros/cons of the functionality of the camera I just wanted to add two pieces of information regarding the available accessories:<br /><br />1. There's no car adapter.  Yes, that means, heaven forbid, if you'd like to go on a longer trip without having access to a wall outlet you had better conserve the battery or buy multiple batteries.  Take a road trip?  Go camping for a few days?  Now who would have ever thought people would want to take a bunch of pictures on such occaisions.<br /><br />2. The 'AC adapter' doesn't charge the battery.  There are two options to charging your battery: Use the dock or buy the separate battery charger.  Once again, this makes it difficult to take on trips.<br /><br />What's most annoying is that these accessories should be very cheap to produce and they are so common with other portable electronics I just assumed they would be available.","Never having had a digital camera and having even less knowledge about how they work, I was very skeptical.  My son actually picked this camera out for me, taking in the above problems.<br /><br />The camera and docking station are a breeze.  I have learned how to use them much quicker than I would have thought.  I also find new features to master.<br /><br />It is easy to use, compact and even a beginner can master it.","Fantastic![...] perfect way to describe this camera. Easy to use, terrific quality. I would highly recommend the camera.","the camera is great my only complain is that I would like to be a little smaller.","What a great camera. Picture quality is very good and the burst is fun to use. Video feature is fun to use. The zoom is great. You can capture a high quality shot from a long distance. Took some shots at a baseball game in the sport mode and it froze the action. (...) Best price I could fine..............","This is my first digital so I did a lot of research before I purchased. It's extremely easy to use, and easy to share pics via e-mail. I'm not computer savy so this was important for me. The pictures look great, there are lots of features available and they are easy to navigate from the menu. The camera is a little bulky, compared to my 35mm, but I'm adjusting!","This is the 3rd digital camera I have purchased, but it is the first one I purchased for myself.  The first digital I bought was a Minolta Dimage 7 for my daughter, which I was very disappointed with.  The picture quality was very poor for a $700 camera.  The only thing I liked about it was the zoom ability of the 7x lens.<br /><br />Well, technology sure has come a long way since then.  The new Kodak is about half the size of the Minolta with 3x more telephoto capacity and more than twice the resolution.  And I love it.  And it was much cheaper.<br /><br />The main reason for choosing this camera was the large lens on a fairly small camera.  And I was not disappointed.  But I am also impressed with Kodak's ease of operation.  When I get a new toy, I sometimes become very impatient when learning how to use it.  I found this camera to be very easy to learn how to do everything it does.  I also got the printer dock, which I think is fabulous.  I originally didn't want the dock, since my younger daughter already has an HP photo printer that can print from the SD card.  But I am glad I did.  It is nice to be able to just set the camera on top of the printer and instantly do anything you need to do with the pictures you take.  It is simple to both print pictures and also to load them onto your computer, all while the battery is charging.  Both the other digital cameras I bought required removal of the batteries to charge them.  What a hassle!<br /><br />I have only had this camera for a couple of weeks, but already have taken hundreds of pictures.  I have only had focus problems on a very few shots, and I chalked that up to inexperience.  The shots that were out of focus were because it focused on something other than the main subject of the picture.  I just need to make sure that I am focusing on what I want to be the subject before taking the picture.  So I was surprised to read about focus problems from other reviewers.  I guess I really haven't taken many low-light pictures, yet.  Actually, the problem I have had is in bright sunlight where it is difficult to see the screen display so you can't see the focus brackets.  I solved that problem by using the viewfinder when in bright sunlight.<br /><br />So I would recommend this camera for the follow reasons:<br /><br />1.  Great telephoto lens<br /><br />2.  Long lasting battery that charges in the camera.<br /><br />3.  Ease of use.<br /><br />4.  Printer dock allows printing, downloading, and battery charging in one package.","Great for a P&S'er, terrible for anybody else!  Kodak started with great options but left a few important ones out.<br /><br />I was an SLR (single lens reflex; non-digital) user and first purchased a Kodak point and shoot (P&S) several years ago.  Although, I am not a professional photographer, I do rely heavily on manual settings like the F-stop, shutter speed and manual focus to manipulate my results.<br /><br />After being satisfied with a Kodak P&S digital I upgraded to the DX7590 which appeared to be great for in its class.  I was satisfied with several options until I began using it and found several missing options that left much to be desired.  I have had this camera since December 2004 and have had plenty of time to get used to the options and settings.<br /><br />If you are an average P&S user and want a camera to do all the work, this is a great camera for you.  If you want to have control over how your picture is taken using the manual settings, this camera isn't for you.  Granted, f-stop and shutter speed are adjustable, but there is no manual focus.<br /><br />This leads me to the focus issue I've encountered and read about in other reviews.  In low light or closeup situations the camera can never autofocus precisely and the camera has no manual focus.<br /><br />I wrote to Kodak to ask about/suggest a firmware upgrade that could address these issues.  Essentially, they said thanks for the suggestion and they are continually producing quality products.  They didn't offer any suggestion or solution to the issues mentioned above.<br /><br />Based on this, I see no use in keeping the camera as it is useless to me without the features mentioned above.<br /><br />On the bright side, in bright lighting the camera does take some great photos and does manage to focus as long as you don't get too close to your subject!  I have several pictures that came out very well.<br /><br />So I hope Kodak gets it right next time by finishing the camera they started!  The Fuji Finepix S5100, S5200, S9000 appears to have the options I really want and need ranging from about $300-$700 dollars.","I put my name on the waiting list and got one of the fist when they started selling them. I have never been disappointed.  I take lots of wildlife and scenery. You can use the different setting for all conditions and the color is  great. The snow setting has given me some great pictures as has the macro for wild flowers. I have had other digital cameras and the Kodak  DX7590 beats them all in its price range.","Bought my DX7590 to take on a trip to Japan in March 2005. I took hundreds of pics in all conditions. While not all the pictures are keepers I was amazed at how great most of them came out.  The battery lasts forever.  And since I bought a spare I never had to worry about having a dead battery.  I also bought 2 1-gig SD cards. So far I have only needed one.  Since the Japan trip I have taken hundreds of pictures at High School graduations, Birthdays, trips to the lake, Skateboard park, etc. etc. I get tons of complements on the pictures I take.  I am still learning how to use all the different features this camera has but just using the auto setting can get you shooting like a pro right out of the box. Love the size too. Easy to carry along. Not too bulky.","The Kodak DX7590 produces, as reviewed, fine quality auto point and shoot pictures.  However, there are enough bells and whistles to learn from.<br /><br />Indoor color seems a bit off, but even that is not too bad.<br /><br />This is not for a pro, but is a great camera for the rest of us.","While it seemed that everyone we know had digital cameras, my husband and I were still using our \"Jurassic\" manual camera. I guess our main issue was none of the photos produced by our friends' digital cameras seemed good enough once printed on paper. Anyway, one of my colleagues at work bought the DX7590 and took plenty of photos while she was overseas.  Lo and behold, she showed me the printouts and I was impressed! So off I went shopping and after comparing it with three other cameras, I thought the price was very reasonable. It features 5.0 megapixels, 10x optical zoom, and alternative movie-mode with sound - whereas other brands with similar features are a lot more expensive (I've looked at Canon and Konica).<br /><br />I've been fiddling with this for a while now and considering I'm a novice, I find that this is very user-friendly. I still need to learn a few more tricks but here's what I found so far:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* High picture quality. The colors and image are vivid and sharp.<br /><br />* Ultra zoom is great<br /><br />* Lightweight<br /><br />* Controls are easy to use<br /><br />* Really excellent for daylight and outdoor photography<br /><br />* Built-in instruction that briefly tells you what each button is for<br /><br />* Video mode is a bonus; just don't expect it to be of the same quality as a proper digital video cam<br /><br />* Battery life is very good<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* The lack of manual focus; I sometimes struggle with the auto focus<br /><br />* Indoor photography and low light might be a bit of a problem<br /><br />* No carry case (at least not here in Australia)<br /><br />All things considered, this novice thinks this is a really great camera that's a real value for money. It might not be suitable if you're after a pocket camera though. Also, make sure you get at least a 256MB SD card, as the internal memory doesn't hold many photos.<br /><br />Highly recommended!","I bought this camera after months of research. The reviews helped me a lot to make my final decision. Bought this camera in April/2005 & took it on a trip to Monterrey in June. I'm amazed how the pictures taken of the 17-mile-drive scenic spots in Pebble Beach turned out, they looked like they were taken by a professional, & I tell you, I'm as amateur as they come :) The 10X optical zoom worked great, birds perched on huge rocks that looked like small specs with the naked eye came out very clear, considering that I didn't use a tripod and my hands weren't that steady at all. Most of my indoor pictures came out okay, a few were blurry since I may have not focused it correctly. The \"scenery\" mode of the camera is great, the landscape & scenery pictures turned out fantastic. Some shots that didn't turn out clear were those taken indoor where flash photography was not allowed (certain sections of the Monterrey Aquarium). But some of my non-flash pictures turned out okay, it seems to work fine for subjects that had some backgound light. Have yet to learn the other camera features, I mostly used the auto mode to just point & shoot. I'm quite satisfied with my purchase, it's a very good buy !","I looked at digital cameras for a few years before selecting the DX7590.  Each year the number of pixels in cameras kept going up while the price stayed about the same.  The first year I was looking a \"good\" consumer camera had about 3 megapixels, then 4, and now I was looking at cameras with 5 megapixels.  What sold me on this camera was the large lens.  Instead of one of those small lenses that most comparable cameras have this one has a real large glass lens manufactured by a real German lens maker.  Yes, it has all the features you might want if you're an amateur and then some.  I probably will never use the manual override features that allows you to set the shutter time and exposure level, etc., instead of allowing the computer to do it for me.  I'm still a little bewildered by the large array of optional settings for different subjects, but I've taken what I think of as superb photos.<br /><br />I've been taking \"snap shots\" since my first Brownie camera 50 years ago.  They were all nice for family albums, but never anything that I would say could compete with professional photos.  But all that has changed.  The picture brilliance, clarity, and overall quality that I'm getting outreaches any of my expectations.  Last week I was on a camping trip and took a photo of the early morning fog across the lake.  Yousers!  It looks to me as good as many I've seen in professional photo exhibitions.<br /><br />One problem I'm having is that the 5 megapixel format is so large that I have to shrink the pictures to put them on a web site.  One reason I wanted a digital camera was to be able to put photos on the Internet.  So I switched to the optional 1.8 megapixels photos, and it's still too large for my web site.  Even at 1.8 megapixel setting the photos are brilliant and clear.  It must be the big lens and quality optics.  I tried taking some pictures of flowers, and some of them came out blurry.  I think I'm having trouble holding it still for the close ups.  I guess I need to put it down somewhere or get a mount.  It does have a setting for minimum focal length that is a lot closer than many comparable cameras.  I got really good close up, and then blurry ones.  Between you and me I suspect it's operator error.<br /><br />I keep forgetting that I can take as many pictures as I want for free and discard any I don't need.  I like viewing them full screen on my PC.  The \"easy share\" base works pretty well.  I have to remember to open the Kodak software and turn on the camera before downloading all the photos to my PC.  I bought some extra memory and that helps.  It says on the screen that I can take 632 pictures at 5 megapixels, or over 1,500 at 1.8 megs.  Maybe it's right. I never take that many.  It's really a lot more camera than I've ever had, or know how to use.  The quality of the pictures is superb.  It's easy to use.","only problem, focus is not that great in dark setting, otherwise, a great digital camera","We bought this camera November 2004 after reading several reviews. The zoom is awesome! The sales woman at CompUSA tried to tell me that I wouldn't want this much zoom since my children are young and not into sports yet. I'm soooo glad I disregarded her advice. I have used the zoom numerous times. This camera takes excellent pictures, especially outdoors. I have had several compliments on the prints from other photographers. Also the battery is amazing! I have had to recharge the battery 2 times since getting it 6 months ago and I have taken hundreds of pictures. We also love the extra features and the fact that the camera tells you what each button does (so you don't have to memorize the instuction manual). We highly recommend the Kodak brand! I haven't totally figured out the manual settings on it yet. That's the only draw back I've had (no artsie fartsie stuff). But you can pretty much do that kind of stuff with a good Photoshop program anyway. All in all great camera!","I've owned this camera for several months now, and overall, I am quite happy with it.  It is very simple to use.  It has plenty of features and enough options to satisfy just about anyone, but is easy enough for a beginner to master.  The video mode is convenient, as well, and I use it in addition to my iBook to make wonderful DVDs.<br /><br />This camera really shines in outdoor settings, especially in bright sunlight.  The colors are vivid and crisp.  The closeup mode is especially nice, and you will get well-focused images just about every time.  My one complaint is that the camera dos not perform as well as it could in low light settings.  I often photograph bands in venues that are not especially well lit, and I sometimes have trouble getting decent shots without resorting to using the flash.  Other cameras I have used have handled these low light situations more effectively.<br /><br />However, this camera is a very good value and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a high performance, versatile camera without shelling out the cash for a digital SLR.  It will serve you well.","This is an easy to use, full featured 5.0 Mpxl digital camera with a super sharp 10X optical zoom lens(plus 3X digital zoom=30X total). It will be difficult to find a larger LCD screen on any other camera.  This screen is 2.2 inches and is huge compared to most cameras. Take my advice and buy a DX7590! I have been a longtime \"high quality\" 35mm SLR film camera user and was reluctant to \"go digital\".  I thought I'd lose the quality and versitility of my 35mm SLR...NOT SO!  The sharpness of this lense and the brillance of the color of the images is certainly equal to (and in most instances better than) anything I got from my 35mm SLR film camera. The \"close up\" mode yeilds some incredibly sharp photos.  This camera has a long list of great features, tricks and neat things it will do for you (like being able to zoom up to 8X when reviewing images on that huge LCD screen). When buying DX7590 with the EasyShare 6000 Docking Bundle, the docking station, which also serves as a battery charger is included in the \"Bundle\" price. This \"Bundle\" is the best value(docking station sells for $60.00-$100.00 if bought seperately). Also, consider buying an extra battery and at least one 128mb (or higher) SD card, both will come in very handy.","If you are a professional of course you are not going to be purchasing a camera in this price range, but if you are a beginner to a amateur you cannot do much better for the price. This camera has so many options it is almost impossible to take a bad picture if used correctly. It does lack a Manual Focus, but the options make up for it, so much that it really doesn't need a manual focus. It does all the work for you if you let it. I do wish it came with a carring case, but that is a minor issue. You will not be disappointed with this purchase unless you are a professional and have over expectations of it.","I have long resisted buying a digital camera because all the ones that compared to my trusty film SLR camera were far too expensive. I chose this one because I was impressed with the amount of lens for the price. The 10x optical zoom on this camera has allowed me to take some wonderful pictures. I didn't realize how much I enjoyed using this camera until I got ready to develop some film photos and realized that I only had 5 rolls. (I usually had 15-20 in the same amount of time.) The digital photos I have been printing look every bit as good as the ones taken with my film camera. Most of the people I have shared them with don't believe that they are digital. The video feature also does a surprisingly good job. It won't replace a regular video camera for important events, but it has allowed me to catch some fun times that I would have missed because I don't drag a video camera everywhere I go. The features on the camera are easy to figure out without studying the manual. Transferring the photos to my computer is simple and quick. The photo software isn't the best, but its managable. I love this camera and would recommend it very highly.","The Kodak EasyShare DX7590 is truly a very nice camera. This is my first digital camera and I was somewhat hesitant about what kind of digital camera to purchase.  However, after a lot of research and reviews, I decided on the DX7590, because for me, it is a middle of the road type of digital camera.  It is has enough pixels (5MP) to take great pictures, as well as a zoom (10x) that will allow me to capture moments from a distance.  Basically, the DX7590 allows me to take quality photos, even when I am not trying.  I purchased the extra memory, the 512 MG card, and I am able to take up to 315 shots.<br /><br />The camera dock is very nice and although I purchased the printer dock plus, I usually leave the camera sitting on the camera dock to charge.  It's small and convenient, that I have it sitting on my dresser corner...it's definitely a space saver.  I would also recommend purchasing the Kodak Printer Dock Plus.  So far, with the pictures I have printed, I have been very satisfied.  No jams, no lines, no bends...just good quality photos.  I wouldn't recommend however if a person has a lot of pictures to print to use the photo printer, it would probably be more beneficial to print them through an online retailer or take it to store as CVS or Target to print them out.  But for a few prints here and there, it's a great in home system.<br /><br />The two together, with me...makes a great team for photography....you can be the same!","This is my second Kodak digital camera and I still Love taking those Kodak Moments!!  I'm not a professional, I just love capturing those fun moments to share with a photo, email or CD to play on our dvd!!  This camera has so many features, but what I like best is the way it makes my photos look so good!!  The Auto feature is my buddie and we take great photos together.  As I learn more about this camera I will be trying all the features.  I had a 2x zoom before and this 10x zoom is the greatest thing since sliced bread!!  It needs a steady hand and I was impressed at how well the photos were without a tripod!!  I Love this Camera and am very happy with my photos...  I'm not a pro just a very happy shutterbug!!  I've taken two 512mg cards of photos and mini movies and not a problem!!  Great Camera!!","Perhaps I shouldn't even be writing a review yet. I bought the camera in December '04 and we just got around to installing the dock. A new USB hub for my elderly puter - plus a better surge protector to guard all the add-ons had to be attended to first. So. We installed it just 4 days ago and I have been taking comparison shots with my old digital camera and experimental shots to get the feel of it. I am impressed. (I have to take into account the fact that this camera -including dock here at Amazon - cost about $100 more than my old Olympus).<br /><br />One of the things I was most interested in was the more powerful optical zoom - 10X optical zoom vs. the old 3X. It's truly amazing.<br /><br />Another difference I noted is that when shooting through a window screen using the zoom at max - the old camera focussed on the screen - so its texture was the most prominent thing. The Kodak focussed on the distant scene with no suggestion of the screen.<br /><br />The lens is far superior to that of the older camera. There appears to be more depth of field. The images need less sharpening and the colors need less adjusting. The latter - I believe - is not a lens function but I'm discussing image quality.<br /><br />I'm finding the dock - which I was uncertain about - to be a very valuable accessory. It makes downloading much easier and faster. It fits neatly in a corner of the desk and does not take up much room. The camera lives there, happily keeping itself charged.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this camera and I'm glad Kodak, headquartered in nearby Rochester NY, has come up with a winner in its line of digital cameras.","This camera is great, wonderful, one of the best on the market...if not for that pesky auto focus feature. I was surprised at how well the video feature works; it's not the same quality you're going to get with a stand alone video camera, but it's not bad either. My may beef with this camera is the auto focus...sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't; I noticed that it's usually out of focus in indoor/night shots when optical zoom is being used. For the most part, this can be fixed by putting it on a tripod.","My husband bought me this camera for Christmas, and I though to myself I will never figure out how to use this!! Was I wrong!! It is SO easy to use! It is lightweight and compact enough to take anywhere. And not to mention, the quality of the pictures is awesome!! It takes much better pictures than my old 35mm camera. I definetly recommend this camera, it is well worth every penny.","This is my first modern digital camera.  Years ago, I had one of the early Apple-branded digital cameras that was more of a novelty than a true camera.  I was waiting for both some specific features, a good price for those features, and quality printing at a good price.  I feel like with that camera and with digital printing services at places like Costco and Walgreen's, this was the time.<br /><br />The camera functions great.  I'm a basic user, so I'm still exploring some of the awesome features.  A biggie for me is the optical zoom.  A 10X optical zoom is not very common but really important to get quality prints when you zoom.  This camera won't let you down there.<br /><br />Of course, you'll want to get a memory card for your camera.  The camera has 32MB built-in (great for spill-over), but I bought a 512MB card that lets me store over 150 high-quality pictures.  Well worth the investment, trust me.<br /><br />The battery life so far has been really great.  Kodak says I can leave the camera in the dock (but I hate leaving things on a trickle charger - I'm old school and have wrecked too many batteries by overcharging), so I only charge as needed.  I've gone days (like over the holidays) taking pictures with no need to recharge.<br /><br />The transfer via the dock is pretty slick - just dock the camera, hit the transfer button, and let it go.  I'm using USB 1.1 and it works great.  I did buy a memory card reader too (in case I needed pictures off the camera but the camera wasn't available), but so far it's been easier to just use the dock.<br /><br />The software that comes with the camera is good - but very basic.  It allows for basic corrections - red eye, cropping, rotating, brightness, contrast, that sort of thing.  I highly recommend getting something else to do heavy-duty editing - like a nice Adobe product.  I use Photoshop Elements 3.0 myself.<br /><br />One cool feature in the Kodak software is the ability to easily upload your pictures to Ofoto.com.  I don't use their printing services (Costco & Walgreen's is generally cheaper), but it is a great way to share photos with others (who can then order them if they want) and it's also a great way to archive those photos.  Best of all, it's free.<br /><br />Overall, I've been very pleased with this camera.  I've got plenty to learn, but this camera let me get started with taking great pictures immediately.","This camera was an early Christmas present for my husband and myself.  We absolutely love it and cannot wait for our next grandbaby to be born in April because the close-ups are unbelievable!  The convenience of printing our own chosen prints at home is also a great bonus!  We recommend this Kodak camera to everyone!","I purchased this camera through Amazon.com and have been using it for about two weeks now. The camera is easy to operate and the pictures are excellent. The 10X zoom is one of the few zooms that remain clear and focused when at 10X. Would recommend for the new as well as the experienced photographer.","this camera rocks!  it really outdoes most of the competition, and when you include the low price and other features, there are no real competitors.  kodak offers a 10x zoom and has 5 megapixels for super sharpness, even if you decide to enlarge the picture.  also, the camera can grow with you as there are wide angle, telephoto and close-up lenses available through amazon.  for quick prints, there is also a nifty printer that prints a 4x6 picture in under 2 minutes (also available through amazon).  the quality of the print is like a local shop, and the printing method, which uses a protective coating, makes sure the colors last forever (ink-jet printers can run/fade).  as an option, local photo shops can print your pictures from the camera.<br />in sum:<br />--the price is great, especially for 5 megapixels.<br />--kodak is the number one brand for digital cameras.  they will be around to supply the camera/your photographic needs.  kodak is a trusted u.s. company while some others may not be around in ten years.<br />--it's easy to use (no computer necessary).  but if you have a computer, the camera/printing dock can e-mail photos.<br />--the camera has a 10x optical zoom -- super sharp pictures with great color of the kids/nature from far away.<br />some others offer similar features, but nobody has the whole package at this price.  a home run!","I'm having to edit this review, since the \"Spotlight Review\" that led me to orignally post it, seems to have disappeared, and Amazon edited my original review. My concern about the reviews of digital cameras is that some reviewers are so obviously trying to scare consumers away from a specific brand, I guess, in hopes they will then go buy another brand. I think this is unfair, and it's particularly bad when such a review ends up a \"Spotlight\" one, even though most of the readers found it to be unhelpful.<br /><br />Here's a few facts about Kodak digital cameras, like this fabulous DX7590: 1) According to J.D. Powers and Associates, Kodak rates highest in customer satisfaction in the $200-$399 & $400-$599 price ranges. 2) Kodak is now just a little behind Sony in digital camera sales. No other digital camera company has gotten so close to Sony! Canon--a favorite of Amazon--is third. 3) Years ago, before Kodak turned all its attention to digital cameras, it's cameras were not the best.  Those days are long gone, but some choose to ignore this.<br /><br />The DX7590 is a combination of two other fabulous Kodak cameras--the DX7630 and the wildly popular DX6490. All three of these cameras are very \"complex\" cameras, as \"point and shoot\" ones go, but yet they are so simple to use. In my opinion, it takes high intelligence to make a complex thing, that is totally foreign to many people, easy to understand and easy to use.  Kodak has done this with its digital cameras. And these cameras make beautiful prints!  The EasyShare software, too, is very simple, and allows you to easily put photos in albums, print at home, or burn your pictures to CDs.  You can even download your album names and e-mail addresses into the camera, and then they will automatically go into albums or be set up for e-mailing, as soon as you put the camera back on the dock.<br /><br />Everyone I know with a Kodak digital camera loves it. But some people will not,of course. No one camera, or one brand of camera, will appeal to everyone. I strongly suspect, however, Kodak cameras have become so popular due to word of mouth. Just don't allow any reviews at Amazon, or any other place, scare you away from getting a Kodak camera, or any other brand of camera, as it's obvious some really want to do. While some reviewers sincerely and seriously don't like the Kodak camera they bought, other reviewers have other agendas. Talk to people you know who have a camera, or brand of camera, that you're thinking of buying, and see how they like it.  Try out the cameras you're thinking of buying, and see how easy or hard they are for you to use.<br /><br />I personally find the Kodak cameras, particularly the more complex ones, to be terrific.","Hi...I own the previous model (DX 6490) which I purchased in May 2004. I'm very happy with it..pity I can't replace it now with the latest model..but that's the price of 'obsolescence.' As to the two questions from recent buyers of the 7590 -<br /><br />#1 - I have had no problem with the rubber covers coming off. They are well-secured and I don't see that as an issue. Thus far, I have had no need for any repairs.<br /><br />#2 - on the battery charger set with the various voltages: I bought that kit and took it with me to the UK/Wales last summer. It charged my battery w/o problem. I think it was a worthwhile purchase.","I've taken a lot of pictures with this camera as well as with many other digital cameras. I rank this camera near the top for cameras in this price range.<br /><br />Rather than going through all of the features, I'm going to comment on what I think makes this camera stand out and what I think this camera lacks.<br /><br />Two of the things that make this camera really stand out are:<br /><br />1. It has a huge lens, and<br /><br />2. The lens is made out of glass, not plastic.<br /><br />I believe that these two factors make more of a difference in photo quality than other things, such as a high mega pixel count. You can really see the quality in the photos that this camera takes. The colors are accurate. The images are sharp. And there is no noise when you take a low light, flash photo.<br /><br />Other nice things about this camera:<br /><br />The flash is more than adequate. The 2.2\" LCD is really nice. The movies it takes are decent and you have unlimited movie time. It has a ton of user options and features. And of course, the zoom on this camera is incredible for the size and price. This camera has many, many nice things about it, too numerous to go into here.<br /><br />The down sides are few. One of them is that the camera is big. I really can't consider it a \"pocket\" camera because it simply won't fit in your pocket. But that's the trade off for the big lens and the huge zoom.<br /><br />This camera also has some difficulty focusing in low light. This is the reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Kodak did improve on this from the previous version of this camera (the DX6490) but every camera manufacturer should add that little red light that shines on the subject so that the camera can achieve a proper focus in low light. This is the one feature that I think this, and all cameras that don't have a manual focus, should absolutely have.<br /><br />If you're looking for a pocket camera, this probably won't suit your needs. Just remember that most, if not all pocket cameras in this price range have really small, plastic lenses. Usually this means a very noticeable sacrifice in image quality (the Sony-T1 is an example of this).<br /><br />Before you buy this camera, I would recommend you look into the Fugifilm Finepix S5000 and S5100. These are also excellent cameras, but I prefer the Kodak.","I'd like to purchase the DX7590.  However, I'll be moving abroad (am writing from the US) to a country that uses 220 volts.  Since I've never owned any Kodak digital cameras, I'd like to know if the EasyShare Dock 6000 will work abroad.  If it's just a matter of plugging it in to a USB port for it to work instead of plugging it in to an electrical outlet, I think I'll be okay purchasing it.<br /><br />I would also like to purchase the Kodak Li-Ion Rapid Battery Charger Kit.  I'm assuming that since it comes with different country adapters, I will be able to recharge the battery wherever country I may be.  Is it supposed to automatically sense whether it's 110 or 220 volts?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any replies.","After looking for 2 years, reading countless reviews, I purchased the DX7590 with dock and paired it with the Canon IP4000 printer.  I am a novice in photography and this was my first digital camera. With little more than intuition and occasional referencing of the manual I was shooting great shots within an hour of opening the box.  The 10X zoom is great alowing me to fill the picture with the subject of the shot.  Download from the dock is simply a press of one button and wham the computer receives all the images.  The pictures print out looking like they just came from the photo lab.  Don't forget to get a SD card because the camera won't hold many shots.  I mostly shoot and print 4x6 shots and even when cropping shots there was no loss of picture quality.  I would highly recommend this camera to all beginner and intermediate users.","To me, yes it is. The DX7590 is all the DX6490 should've been in the first place. This camera is packed with features. There are 14 scene modes. Scene modes are pre-programmed settings by Kodak for different situations like \"party\" (for indoor photos of people), \"backlight\" (use when the light is behind the subject of the photo instead of behind the photographer), \"children\" (for photos of kids in bright light),\"self-portrait\", \"manner /museum\", \"flower\", \"fireworks\", \"text, \"beach\", \"snow\", \"night landscape\", \"night portrait\", \"close up\", and \"landscape\". On these modes the camera does all the work, sets aperature, shutter speed, exposure compensation, flash compensation and film speed. If the camera shows that you need the flash, use it with these scene modes. I really don't use those for I am trying to become a better photographer and I have been using the \"PASMC\" modes (more on those later). There are also five more modes to choose from and they are auto, sport, portrait, video and the aforementioned PASMC (manual) modes. For auto you control whether or not to use the flash and the exposure compenstion. For portrait and sport, you control just the flash. The \"PASMC\" modes you control just about every thing. the \"P\" mode you control the flash and exposure compensation and the camera adjust the aperature (how wide the lens opens to let light in the camera) and the shutter speed (how long the shutter stays open to let the light in), the \"A\" mode you control flash and exposure along with the aperature the camera control the shutter speed. The \"S\" mode you control the shutter speed, exposure amd flash, the camera control the aperature. The \"M\" mode is where it gets interesting. You control everything. The aperature, shutter, flash, film speed(iso) and the exposure meter acts as a light meter to tell you if the shot will be underexposed or overexposed but does not prevent you from taking the picture. Finally the \"C\" mode is where you can saved your favorite camera settings and they will remain even after you shut the camera down or switch modes.<br /><br />  The Dx7590 is faster at start-up and resetting between shots. There is what Kodak calls \"Exposure Bracketing\". That is when you take a series of shots (3) at different exp levels when you're not sure if the lighting is right. You have 2 different burst modes, a macro and a landscape mode (to use outside of the scene modes), 10X optical zoom and 3X digital zoom for a total of 30X zoom, a choice between fine and standard file compression, 5 megapixels instead of 4, and so much more.<br /><br />  I'm so getting tired of typing so I'm going to wind this review up. To me the DX7590 is a wonderful upgrade from the DX6490. Well worth the purchase in my opinion. Or, if you're in the market and wondering which one to buy...I'd recommend the DX7590. I have both and I'm gonna keep them.","I purchased this camera about a month ago and I am very pleased with it.  It is very simple to use and takes great pictures.  The picture quality of this camera is on par with a Nikon 5.0 megapixel camera.  I compared photos taken on both and although the Nikon quality was slightly better, this Kodak cost $1,000 less.  If you are in the market for a digital camera and want the capabilty to expand, then this is a good choice.  I especially liked the 10x optical zoom and the fact that the lens will accept filters and wide-angle adapters.  Although the camera has 32 megabytes of internal memory, you will want to buy a memory card, they are very inexpensive and can provide the capability of up to 150 pictures.  Hope this review helps.","The Kodak DX 7590 at $499.99 is a damn good deal!  Kodak states that you can print 20\"x30\" poster shots, but if you want photo quality you're better off sticking with 16\"x20\" at most.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. 10x Zoom - Fabulous! Quick responsive zoom, Schneider<br /><br />  Kreuznach lens.<br /><br />2. 5 MP resolution - Can still maintain high quality prints<br /><br />  with some cropping of the photo.<br /><br />3. 2.2 Inch LCD - Easy to view from most angles, sunlight OK,<br /><br />  In Low light it adjusts itself for easier viewing.<br /><br />4. Dock Included - No worries about buying new batteries or<br /><br />  connecting cords from the camera to the computer.<br /><br />Cons -<br /><br />1. Though they added a new jpg compression setting, the images<br /><br />  still seem a bit too compressed...however, for<br /><br />  everyday purposes and prints, the quality is fine.<br /><br />  But for any major editing and/or cropping...<br /><br />2. No manual focus - This would have been really nice for $500<br /><br />3. Slightly small frame for those of us with medium to large<br /><br />  hands.  My wife can use it fine...but she won't.<br /><br />4. Digital Zoom - Just remove this \"feature\" altogether Kodak.<br /><br />Overall - the camera is a good buy. From the pews, I was able to get some amazing shots at a recent wedding.  The potential for this camera to rival the quality of film is there...it's in your hands.","This camera is loaded with many special features such as an easy to use dial that allows specific selections to a much larger screen that allows you clear viewing of all your pictures even in bright light.<br /><br />It fits nicely in your hand and the toggle switch for telephoto/zoom makes getting that close up shot a breeze!  The camera dock is easy to use and charges the battery as stated within three hours.  I've also purchased a 512 mg card and at the 5 mega pixels setting the DX7590 can store 315 pictures.<br /><br />When you turn on the camera it helps you with each setting, allowing you to pick the right one for the job and even going as far as telling you to turn on the flash or hold the camera steady.<br /><br />The pictures from the camera are bright, colorful and crisp and ready to be printed out.  The camera allows you easy transfer of the pcitures between camera and printer or computer and the colors come alive with the right color printer.  Even on draft mode the pics are decent quality.  The internal settings allow for easy saving and documentation of special events in folders as well as individual pictures.<br /><br />The only minor issue with the camera is that a proper hand hold on the left side might give the users better stability.  The right side offers an easy hand hold with flip up access to the memory card.<br /><br />Over all this camera is one excellent camera and one excellent buy for under $500.00.  The entire package, including zoom, 32 mg internal memory, charging dock and 5mg pixel capabilities make this a great buy!<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Additional info 5-31-05  Rated only 3 stars now!<br /><br />Found Some Flaws and Kodak will not help, May 31, 2005<br /><br />After using this camera for more than several months, it's been to the shop to replace a bad zoom lens. Kodak sent out a new camera and the new camera had updated software for the low light situation but it did not fix the problem. The camera takes awesome bright and average light pictures but the low light pictures come out blurry. Here is some of the email sent to me from Kodak.<br /><br />RE: Case# 7405518<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear of your low light focus problem. If you're sure you have upgraded your firmware to 1.01 there is little more we can offer as a solution at this time.

And learned all the little trick that mags. use to do their photos as well. I've done several \"ghost\" shots my self. My second digi was a HP Photosmart M425, That I've had for close for 7or 8 yr now. Just had started having a little prob. w/ fuzzy pics. So, I bought this camera from Joe HP Photosmart M307 3MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom. And let me tell everyone it is just exactly like the first one that I had. It is a great camera it is very easy to use. If you are really into cameras and want a fun one this is the camera for you. It has multiple options that you can choose from. And just have fun with.<br />I know I have been very busy, this past Christmas. Since I had to take a toad of digi's. And hours of vid. Can't wait until next mon. I'm planning on getting another digi from Joe. Plus I've told my sister about him. She just may start buying from him as well.<br />Great product Joe,<br />Norma Tate","I agree with the positive reviews already here.  A previous review said the battieries died rapidly.  HP has a firmware upgrade on it's website.  You've absolutely have to download and install it - makes it like a brand-new camera.  And you'll be able to use whatever batteries you like after the upgrade is installed.","As some already mentioned, battery life is not long, but with a couple of rechargeable batteries, you should be fine. After all, you will have a descent camera at a low price!","This is my first digital camera. I dont know why everyone has been giving it such low ratings, I think it a really nice little camera for what I paid to get it.<br /><br />All of the controls are pretty easy to figure out, it takes only about 30 minutes of screwing around to get it.<br /><br />Im able to keep upwards of 700 photos or an hour and a half of video on the thing because Ive got a 1GB SD card though.<br /><br />Batteries will work for a long time if you use better batteries.<br /><br />There are defineately better cameras than this one, but they are higher priced. This is my first camera, and Ive taken alot of really nice photos sofar, and it has not given me trouble once in the months that I have been using it.","This is great little starter camera for digital rookies like myself.  It has a very user friendly menu and help screens if you're not sure what the functions are. Battery life does suck, but only if you use Nimh AA batteries, invest in some lithiums, it will make all the difference in the world.  I've taken over 200 pics with Energizer AA lithium batteries and I haven't had a low battery prompt yet.  Get a high memory SD card and you're all set.<br /><br />I found that I got the best pics by keeping the settings on AUTO.  I also have a HP computer, I just stick my SD card in the card slot on the front of my tower and I can print my pics from my computer.  How simple is that???  I wanted a camera with higher megs so I upgraded to a M417, but the M307 is still a quality camera for the price.<br /><br />PS.  If you use Nimh batteries and the battery life gets low, the camera will start functioning strangely (it won't zoom, or shut down, or retract the lens when power is off)!!","Pros:  This is is a very good digital starter camera.  It is relatively cheap and easy to use, in fact my 11 year old set it up right out of the box.  Being a digital camera rookie, I found that if I left all the settings on AUTO my pictures turned out fantastic.<br /><br />Cons:  To save on battery life the camera will turn off  by itself (there might be a setting to change this) and when the battery life gets low, some of the functions will not work (like zoom, and lens will not go back into camera when shut off), also the internal memeroy is extremely small, you only get about 7 great quality pics.<br /><br />To allieviate the above problems invest in a large SD card (like a 256mb and you can get over 200 pics) and some quality lithium batteries (I've taken over 200 pics with the same set of batteries and no probs)!!!<br /><br />(...)","We bought this camera to take to my class reunion.  It came with a memory card.  So far, we have taken 36 photos and a short video clip.  Have not had to replace the batteries yet. (we don't expect them to last forever)  No problems of any kind.<br /><br />The camera is easy to use.  Pictures turned out great.  When viewing them on the computer, they were more clear with ACDSee software than the HP software.<br /><br />Great camera for the money.  Gets a \"thumbs up\" from us.","I have a feeling that if A. Rodriguez had to replace his camera after almost 2 months, it probably means that there was something with HIS camera not the actual model. I have this camera and it works perfectly fine and I have no complaints. When the flash loads, it takes at the most 5 seconds to do so (and just when you take the first picture after turning on your camera, not at any other time) and when taking a picture, it takes 2 seconds do so at the regular setting. Just tonight I had a \"problem\" with this camera and I went to HP's support and troubleshooting at [...] and they, true to their word, replied in an hour and helped solve the \"problem\" which turned out to not be a problem at all. He told me how to fix it by changing the ISO Speed, White Balance, and EV Compensation and everything was how it was supposed to be. I definently recommend this camera."]},{"name":"HP Photosmart R507","amazon_reviews":["Camera arrived well packaged and with all necessary accessories,, works great<br />and has all the functions I appreciate in a small, compact digital camera.<br />The price was good  too<br />Louis","Bought an HP Photosmart R717 in the summer of 2005 for $324.74. 4 months after the camera warranty was up and after minimal usage the camera was displaying: 0000000F-10FB-1BD-024 Error Message, on the display screen.<br /><br />When I called HP about getting my camera repaired I was told that it would be too expensive to repair.

The quality of the LCD screen is the best I have seen on a digital camera, it is much better than the grainy crap that is offered on the HP digitals. The camera has a movie mode that includes sound and it takes an alright video (If you want a movie, buy a camcorder). An interesting thing about the E500 is how it stores pictures on the XD card it uses.

It had some small scratches but still looked pretty sharp.  Simple colors, small but reasonable size, and easy to use accessories were the hallmarks of the E510.<br /><br />I turned it on and played with it for awhile.  The camera has as many features as most high-end 35mm units.  It takes full video with sound.  The photos are stunningly clear and consistent.  The pictures can be set a 5Mpixel or several lower settings to conserve memory.  It has more features than I can or am willing to describe here.  The real downside is the xD memory card, they're teeny tiny small and more expensive than other flash memory.  If you are looking for a consistent, FAIRLY simple (if you've used 35mm cameras before this is no problem), and reasonably priced camera, you've found it.  Even closer to the brand new price of $225 I would consider buying this camera.  My nephew loved the software cd that came with it.

I was able to find it for around $55 + shipping (compared to $225 new).  Once I received it I opened it because I was unsure about the quality of the camera and the condition since it was a refurb.  It had some small scratches but still looked pretty sharp.  Simple colors, small but reasonable size, and easy to use accessories were the hallmarks of the E510.<br /><br />I turned it on and played with it for awhile.  The camera has as many features as most high-end 35mm units.  It takes full video with sound.  The photos are stunningly clear and consistent.  The pictures can be set a 5Mpixel or several lower settings to conserve memory.  It has more features than I can or am willing to describe here.  The real downside is the xD memory card, they're teeny tiny small and more expensive than other flash memory.  If you are looking for a consistent, FAIRLY simple (if you've used 35mm cameras before this is no problem), and reasonably priced camera, you've found it.  Even closer to the brand new price of $225 I would consider buying this camera.  My nephew loved the software cd that came with it.  The included software didn't need to be installed for Windows XP (plug and play).  He described the photo management software as a very basic version of photoshop.  All in all this is a fully functioning digital camera for a great price.","I thought from the description that the camera's image in the built in display could be better (sometimes is too dark).<br /><br />Takes great pictures and the option of adding extra lenses is great.<br /><br />Its very easy to use and the auto photo shoot does everything you need.<br /><br />Overall rating is excellent.","This has been a great camera.  I've been using this camera to learn more about photography.  It has manual controls for apeture, shutter speed and ISO settings.  My only complaint is the XD picture card.  They tend to be more expensive than the other memory cards on the market.  [..]","As excited as I was to buy my Fuji E510 last June, I have found that it does not truly live up to my expectations.<br /><br />The outside pictures come out with great quality. On a trip to San Antonio, I have post card quality pictures of the Alamo. However, during the past 3 weddings that I have attended within the past 3 months, I have very few pictures to show for it.<br /><br />If you turn the flash on, the pictures are clear, but dark as ever. If you turn the flash off, the color is brighter, but you're lucky to be able to see what you have just photographed because of the blur. The shake effect on this camera for non-flash, indoor photos is absolutely horrible. I am upgrading to an Olympus, which I hope will be a more dependable camera for future wedding pictures. If not, I'll find one out there that will.","I use this camera for a mid size architectural practice to take field and documentation photos. Excellent quality for the price. Has a fairly wide angle lens when needed. Goes up to 5 megapixels and has a very quick recovery time both for the flash and shutter, Not as tiny and sleek as some of the other cameras out there but a real workhorse and half the price. Also it's really not all that big. I bought three for my office.","i love the feel of it,it is excellent for first time user whom want to just point and shoot,it also have additional features to explore.the flash so far has been excellent.i mit get in trouble for this but in a way it feels like a smaller version to the sony dsc-h1","This camera is just OK. Photos at night are not so good (as you can read in others reviews) and most of my photos have to be taken twice, both in days and nights. Why? It blurries amost everything! If I would had a bit more money, Sony would be my option!","I've owned many different cameras since becoming a shutterbug in the late 70s, and this one for the price ($159 new in sales tax free Oregon) is a winner on all counts. It has the solidity, heft and optional manual functions that seem right to folks who started on 35mm cameras, takes clean pictures and seems built to last.<br /><br />Like all digital cameras it eats batteries, so a charger is a good idea. And 5.2 pixels is ridiculous overkill for any pictures that you don't plan to blow up to poster size. At the camera's lowest resolution setting you get pictures that are sharp enough for general purpose photography--snapshots, email and website photos.<br /><br />Prices on digital cameras have gone down so fast in the past couple of years. If you could have found one this good a couple years ago it would have cost an arm and a leg--they seem to just get better and better, even compared to my beloved old Nikon and Minolta 35mm dinosaurs!","* Medium grade Camera, battery life long<br /><br />* Picture not satisfactory - night mode never clear<br /><br />* Lots of pictures (150 or more) with just 256 mb memory<br /><br />* Takes much time between snapping (most irritating)<br /><br />* I bought this because it was in sale, not because its good<br /><br />* Flash power not so powerful<br /><br />* I'd go for Canon or Kodak now<br /><br />* Very good service for all time purpose<br /><br />* Smooth function when transfer pictures to computer.<br /><br />* not good for zooming or near picture (for example 5 inch) - for your research if you need to take picture -- this is not the camera.<br /><br />* I have used it roughly -- still great.","This is my second Fuji brand camera - the menu system is very easy to use. I bought this camera because I wanted an inexpensive (I paid $170 total) general camera that was small yet functional. I will tell you the pros and cons.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1 - 28mm wide angle, this is awesome! Try to find another camera with that much wide angle that is not a DLSR or overly expensive. This feature alone makes this camera worthy of being your travel camera for the landscape shots.<br /><br />2 - Fast start up and relatively fast picture taking (not necessarily several frames per second but your first general picture shot is quick).<br /><br />3 - runs on AA batteries. You will never have problems with battery availability and the battery life is very good.<br /><br />4 - xD card format. Forget about what the previous rating said xD cards are the way to go. They are the newest technology, extremely fast, reliable and durable. So what, you pay $10 more than for an equivalent SD or compact flash - it is worth it!<br /><br />5 - nice size, this camera is small but it has a nice feel and heft to it. It will fit in your hand firmly and your pocket comfortably. The lens hides away quickly and safely flush within the body.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1 - Only 2 AA battery power, unfortunately having AA is great, but only having two means flash takes a wee bit more time to charge up than what I would like. Not a total bad thing, but noticeable.<br /><br />2 - 3.2X optical zoom. Now days this is the bare minimum and you would have expected Fuji to have done better ~ like 5x or at least 4X at the minimum.<br /><br />3 - 5.2 MP, not bad but then again not really that good anymore. Still the quality of the pictures is outstanding, so for most photos you are fine.<br /><br />4 - weak flash, not really good for more than about 6' to 8' maximum. A little disappointing, but with only 2 AA you can't get much juice for flash anyway.<br /><br />5 - 2\" LCD, the clarity is impressive, but 2\" is no longer the standard 2.5\" minimum is.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />In summary this is a great camera. Especially if you just need a general travel camera that would be great for hiking, walking tour excursions, ect. I highly recommend it!! The only drawback and what prevents me from ranking it a 5 is the slow flash recharge and the short flash distance. Other than that my CONS are mostly wishful thinking and my PROS are very satisfying for a camera of this price and usefulness.","For someone looking for a simple point-and-click camera that can be easily operated by the biggest of idiots, this probably isn't for you. The Fujifilm is a good camera for those who are stepping up from the basics, but not yet an avid amateur photographer.<br /><br />Compared to your basic point and shoot digital camera, like the Olympus D-395, this one has many features at a very good price. It's great for someone looking to learn more about photography but not yet willing to spend several hundred dollars if they're not sure they'll become immersed in the hobby.<br /><br />However, those that fit that description should note that it's easy to screw up a picture if you screw with the settings without being sure of what you're doing. But once you get the hang of what happens when you change this and that, it's a pretty good camera to use as a learning tool.<br /><br />As with any other electronic though, you should research carefully and decide what you want it to do the most. For instance, when I decided on a new camera, my priority was to get one with a great macro function. As such, this one was perfect for me. But for those looking for something like night shots as their top interest, I'd suggest something from the Canon A-series.<br /><br />Alright, enough of that, I'll get to my pros and cons for this camera:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Macro shots. This camera has TWO macro modes- macro and super macro- and they're better than any camera I've ever used. Absolutely AMAZING macro photos. Hell, this is the first camera I've ever used that even HAD a super macro mode, and it was a wonderful addition. If the lighting is good enough, you can take a clear super macro shot without the need for a tripod or any sort of camera stabilization.<br /><br />- Color and lighting. I rarely ever use flash in photography. My white balance is always on auto, and every single photograph has been an accurate capture of the scene's tones and color.<br /><br />- Dark objects in photos. One problem I've had with digital cameras in the past was a very grainy, three-toned pixellated pattern on dark objects in photograph (like a black shirt). This camera doesn't give me that.<br /><br />- Shutter lag. Practically non-existent. You press the shutter button, it takes the picture. There's no waiting, unless you have it on the 2 sec shutter speed, but then, that's not the camera's fault.<br /><br />- LCD. Not only is it larger than most cameras, but the menus are  VERY easy to understand, and Fuji put a durable plastic protector over the LCD, so if it gets stabbed by something in your purse or scratched, the screen won't be damaged at all.<br /><br />- Optional lens additions. The silver plastic ring surrounding the existing lens is removed to allow a lens adapter, which can be used to hold a telephoto lens, a wide angle conversion lens, and any 43mm filter.<br /><br />- Portraits and candid shots. This camera does just fine with human and animal subjects, be it a group shot with your friends or a snapshot of the dog sleeping. No worries there. I've noticed others saying that they've had some red-eye shots, but since I don't use flash, I can't really speak on that. However, given the right software, red-eye can be easily taken care of anyway.<br /><br />- Manual focusing. On any of the 4 manual modes (Programmed auto, Shutter priority, Aperature priority, Manual), you can open the menu and switch the focus option from auto to manual. A pretty cool feature, but it really only does you any good if you're working with a stationary object. Still, it's come in handy before.<br /><br />- USB interface cable. Unless you have an external card reader or a newer desktop PC that comes with several built-in card readers, you're going to need this cable. And really, there's no use in buying a card reader, because this interface works just fine. It can transfer a good 100 pictures and delete the ones on the card in a matter of a couple minutes.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Flash recycle. If you use the flash, it takes about 5-7 seconds to recycle and charge for another flash.<br /><br />- Tiny viewfinder. This may just be me, since my 35mm has a HUGE viewfinder. I'm just not used to such a small thing. Not that I ever use it that often...<br /><br />- The A/V & USB output ports cover is untethered to the camera. I lost mine within an hour. Fuji DOES include a second one, but I didn't bother with it anyway, since the absence of the cover isn't really that big a deal to me.<br /><br />- It takes a lot of practice to get used to night shots and how to take them. This camera CAN take night shots, but you'll be spending a lot of time learning how to take them to get decent ones. I don't mind the practice so much, but others probably will.<br /><br />- The slowest possible shutter speed is only 2 seconds, which is sort of weak for long exposure photography (probably part of why night shots are difficult).<br /><br />- The fuction dial is way too easy to turn. Before you take a shot, you have to make sure it's on the mode you want it on. (I once tried to take a candid shot in a crowd, only to find that the dial had flipped over to night shot! Needless to say, that photo didn't turn out).<br /><br />- Included software is pretty weak if you're used to having a lot of control, like with PhotoShop or PhotoStudio.<br /><br />Accessories that are a MUST:<br /><br />- A tripod if you do night/landscape shots. Also good for some macros. A $20 3-way pan tripod will work splendidly.<br /><br />- NiMH rechargeable batteries and a charger. This thing will eat through disposable AA's in no time.<br /><br />- Higher capacity xD card. The 16mb included card will hold 11 photos at 5mp normal. A 128mb will hold between 90 and 100 pictures at 5megapixels normal, and about 50 at 5mp highest quality (5mp normal is just great anyway, so there's not much need to go higher).<br /><br />- For those who dabble in photomanipulation or basic editing, a copy of Adobe PhotoShop or Arcsoft PhotoStudio is recommended.<br /><br />- If you dislike wrist straps as much as I do, a cheap case with a shoulder strap or belt loop is a good idea. It'll fit in pretty much any small camera case, so you may even have one already (I use my dad's old Minolta case with a belt loop; fits just perfectly with room for batteries and the USB & A/V cables).<br /><br />So, as mentioned above, it really depends on how you want to use this camera. Those looking for an inexpensive camera with excellent macros should DEFINITELY consider this one. I have yet to find a camera with better macro shots under twice the price of this one. But those interested mostly in night and very low lighting photography should look elsewhere.","This camera is amazing!  I love having most of the settings on the top of the camera instead of having to navigate around on the LCD screen.  Also, I love the fact that the flash pops up giving me the option to not use it, although the camera has a flash warning icon.  The macro and super macro are seriously amazing features and were the deciding factor in selecting this camera.  If you are familiar with digital cameras as well as the old school photography including shutter speed and light meters, this camera is simple to use right out of the box.  I barely glanced at the instructions before I started shooting a buch of great pics.  I read them thoroughly after becoming familiar with the camera and they are well written and easy to understand.  This camera gave me a lot of control in how I want my pictures to come out.  The LCD screen is huge. 2\" lets me see everything I need to before taking pictures so I hardly ever use the viewfinder.<br /><br />The reason I say this is not for the amateur is because it does have a lot of features.  When given so much control, if you don't understand how to use all the features to the best of your ability and different lighting and depth, a lot can go horribly awry.  This is not the typical point and shoot digital.  If you are looking for something with a few bells and whistles and easy to use, I recommend the Fuji A340.  It has 4 megapixels and is virtually fool-proof.  I got one for my Dad for Father's Day this past year and it's so easy to use that even my Mother can take great pictures (sorry Mom)!  For the most part, i've found that both these cameras take great pics that are of comperable quality when set to their highest resolution.  Both are about the same price.","Pros<br /><br />5.2 million pixels, Auto focus, 4 preprogrammed scene types: sports, night, portrait, landscape, Color modes: Standard, Chrome, B&W, Auto flash, 2.0-inch LCD monitor, Real-image optical viewfinder(approx. 80% Coverage), Power source: 2 AA alkaline batteries(replacing the batteries is easy), Movie recording[though this feature's quality isn't very good:(], Storage Media: xD-Picture card(16MB to 512MB)(with is the smallest and the fastest media).<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />movie mode quality isn't very good, batteries run out fast, you have to click shutter button hard.<br /><br />Full Review<br /><br />I love this Camera! I got it from Newegg.com for 209.99 + 4.99 S/H. Newegg.com has fast shipping as user! it's got a lot of features. like a big 2'in LCD screen, auto mode, zoom in, movie mode, 5.2MP, Real-image optical viewfinder(approx. 80% Coverage) some camera don't even have a viewfinder, Etc. I really don't use the software it came with, I just use the Brother's 5480cn photo capture driver. I had some problems with this camera at first kept on clicking the shutter button, I found out that I wasn't clicking it hard enough:) the movie mode quality isn't very good. (320x240 94 Sec., 160x120 288 Sec.) another downside is that this camera eat up a lot of batteries and I had to replace them four times already!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />Yes<br /><br />Amount Paid (US$): 216.45<br /><br />Operating System: Windows<br /><br />Processor: Pentium 4 2.4GHz<br /><br />Processor speed: 400MHz<br /><br />RAM: 512MB DDR-SDRAM<br /><br />Internal Storage: DVD-RW and DVD-ROM<br /><br />Hard Drive (GB): 80GB","I LOVE this camera!  Both indoor and outdoor pictures turn out great, and after I invested in rechargable AA batteries, the camera will last a long time.  Also, I was impressed with the macro function, and the grip is very nice.  Smaller cameras are nice, but I need a grip because I can be a little clumsy.  The xD card was kind of expensive, but well worth the money.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because of the extra money I had to invest to make it usable (i.e. the batteries and the picture card.)  But besides that I can't wait to take more pictures with it!","I purchased a Fuji E510 in December.  Over the past few months I have taken about 1000 shots.  I purchased the E510 because I wanted a camera with manual controls and close-up capabilities that my older Fuji FinePix A210 did not have.  The E510 is small and easy to use.  Taking pictures is fast and easy, and battery life it excellent.  Close-up pictures of flowers are clear and crisp.  Portraits also look excellent.  My big complaint is that wide angle landscape shots are not sharp.  Buildings, backgrounds, and landscape shots all look fuzzy.  My older Fuji FinePix A210 (only 3 megapixel) yields much better shots outdoors.  If you want to take wide angle pictures outdoors, of mountains or cityscapes, for example, I would not recommend the Fuji FinePix E510.","This is a wonderful camera that does exactly what I wanted it to.<br /><br />The macro & super-macro functions work wonderfully.  I took some pictures outside when it was overcast and getting on towards dusk, those pictures came out better than I dreamed.  I also took some pictures with the flash, that works great as well.<br /><br />The camera takes 2 AA batteries, which is nice and generic.<br /><br />What is REALLY GREAT about this camera is all the different modes, including modes where I can set it for aperture priority, speed priority, or I can adjust the ISO mode.  As someone who grew up using her dad's SLR, I was leery of getting a digital camera because of the lack of control.  But this camera lets me add that control, and all for under $300.<br /><br />Additionally:<br /><br /> - The handle design is great also.<br /><br /> - The instruction manual is laid out well and easy to read.<br /><br /> - While the controls are not the most intuitive I've ever seen, they're laid out in a good pattern and once I read the manual, I doubt I'll ever forget them.<br /><br /> - The bundled software works well.<br /><br /> - And the option to attach telephoto or wide-angle lenses is very welcome.<br /><br />I've already told my mom how great it is and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good intermediate camera.  Definitely five stars.","The Macro and Super Macro function on this camera are the best I have seen.  I was able to hold the lens maybe an inch away from my watch and have it focus sharply on this.  My casio Z4U, Kodak EasyShare 7630, and any Sony camera I tested can't do this.  The Macro function is truely the best I have seen and can take very shart closeup shots of flowers, or whatever.  The colors come out a  lot more vibrant than the Z4U, and there is less noise in the pictures.  The night shots with this camera are also the best I have seen.  Focus in night shots are sharp and this camera has a powerful flash.  The only reasons I didn't give this camera five stars is the battery door is plastic, and there is no latch to hold the AA batteries in which are under a lot of spring pressure and it is difficult to close the battery door with all of that pressure.  I actually like proprietary batteries that are camera chargeable, instead of buying separtate NIHM and chargers.  Also the LCD is a little dim and amber looking at night, making one think that the pictures will be dim, but they come out great. SOme of the out door scenery pics came out soft but that could jsut be my lack of experience with the camera, for example Center Focus, Multi Focus, etc?  Over all a good camera with GREAT macro modes!","This is a great little camera.  Even w/ the batteries and memory card, it's still light weight.  Sure, there are smaller ones, but the grip on this one made it easy and pleasant to take pictures.  Not only is this camera very easy to use, but it also offers great features.  The features that I liked are: design/style, 2\" led, the use of only 2 AA batteries, button to power on/off (don't like the sliding ones, too many accidents), and it has a dial for selecting picture modes (that's the fastest and easiest way).  Since I only paid $225 online incl. shipping for this camera, I found it to be bargain.<br /><br />Pictures taken outdoors turned out great and very good for those taken indoors.  Still, I'm very content.  The battery does last a long time.  Even w/ the LED on, I was able to take over 100 pics on a single charge before getting a low battery warning.<br /><br />Why am I rating this great little light weight camera a 4 and not a 5?  Because it uses XD cards.  Pls be warned that even though XD cards is one of the smallest and fastest memory card available, it's the most expensive.  That's the only reason that got me to think twice about keeping this camera.  However, after trying it out for a week and seeing the results, I totally love this camera.  I went out an bought a 512 xd card because I'm definitely keeping this one.","After doing a fair amount of research in stores, I settled on this camera and a good price on Amazon.  It's small enough to carry anywhere, but not so small that it's awkward to hold -- in fact my favorite design element is the grip that's easy to hold with one hand.  This was an upgrade from my 3 megapixel kodak camera, and the pictures have been fantastic so far... and I haven't even begun to explore all of the bells and whistles yet.  But definitely a great camera for the price!"]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix E550 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["Don't use it much any more, but it has been a great little pocketable camera.

Be willing to learn a bit about how cameras work in general and about lighting and composition and color.","Bought this just weeks before a two-week road trip, and had to learn in a hurry.  Camera is a step up from my Nikon Cool Pix.  Optical viewfinder is a must-have.  Camera comes with bonus stuff - cords, card, batteries & charger, although the card is too small.  Recommend buying an additional 1G card, a camera case, and at least 2 more pair of NIMH batteries.  On active shoots, batteries only lasted 4 hours.  Camera has more options than Cool Pix and additional lenses are available.  Good stabilization.  Have not tried video yet.","It's definitely an excellent camera for non-professionals. Great image and diverse facilities. I recommend it.","we use two of these cameras for kite photography, and the pictures turn out great. we've had more than a few crash landings with both cameras and both are still going strong, going on four years. great camera and easy to use, nice pictures even when you just use point and shoot mode.","The best digital camera I have bought so far. There are so many features in such a little package. I carry it where ever I go & it has always worked great for me. I keep finding new things it can do. The quality of pictures & video it takes is great for the size & ease of use. The best thing is I can fit the thing in my front pocket with-out feeling I have a huge bulge there. It's also very easy to carry extra 1GB cards due to the XD cards being so small. Fuji has & still makes great cameras.","I purchased this camera and reviewed it in Oct 05, I love it. But I have just had my first experience with the zoom error message after the lens being barely tapped on my desk. After reading all the reviews I was thinking I would have to buy another camera. Then I came across the review from Ross about pulling out the lens until it clicked and the shutter opened and then turning off and back on and I thought oh well what have I got to lose. So I tried it and it WORKED!! My camera is now fully functioning with no zoom error! Thanks Ross and if this happens to you try this!! This is probably all they do when you send it in anyways!! I hope this helps someone!!","After an extensive review of available compact cameras, I decided this was the best choice as a gift for my wife. She wanted a small camera that was easy to use. Period. What I gave her was a small camera, easy to use, with a wealth of advanced features.<br /><br />You have a choice of shutter priority or aperture priority, letting you choose depth of field, and how you capture motion (freeze-frame or sense-of-motion effect).  You have auto-focus/auto-exposure locks, red-eye reduction, vivid color saturation (in F-Chrome mode), PictBridge compatability, adjustable flash brightness, continuing shooting up to 40 frames, voice memo recording...<br /><br />The camera comes with 2 rechargeable AA-size Ni-MH batteries and a wall charger.  I found that alkaline batteries gave longer usage time.<br /><br />This camera is a little workhorse. We took it with us to O'Ahu and loved the resulting images. The 6.3 megapixels allowed us to edit our photos, zooming in and enlarging, with no perceptible loss of sharpness.<br /><br />A great value for the money. And now, you can get 1GB and 2GM memory cards for less than 512MB cards cost a year earlier.<br /><br />Last word: When our first E550 was damaged, I went online to find a replacement camera and found that the price was almost HALF what we had paid a year ealier. So, we bought another E550!!<br /><br />This camera deserves 5 stars. I knocked off one star because we missed some critical shots when power ran out and we weren't prepared with extra batteries.  But, after factoring in the better color saturation and powerful flash and features, we were probably getting as much mileage as possible out of our batteries.","best camera best best be...i cant say anything else, it has everything u need...","I decided that since I have no expertise with cameras, and I needed one for my new job, I would go for a factory refurbished one. So far this camera is everything I could possibly want.Good battery life with Nimh rechargeable batteries, great clear pix, easy to use. The LCD came with some minor scratches, but I guess on a refurb thats to be expected. I like this camera also because it has a viewfinder which a lot of the new cameras do not have.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for an easy to use well made, inexpensive camera to work with.","All I can say is, If you know what you're doing (Basic Knowledge in Digital Photography) You'll Love this Camera. Adobe Photoshop would be nice to have ,too, if you like to play around with the pictures to make it more better. Have Fun!","Made a photo so clear and good the whole house was expanded to greater than the screen could contain. I bought the zoom lens to a wounderful midsize unit.<br />Keep up the work fuji seems like your real good company.","I was a bit worried about this camera after reading a bunch of complaints about lens error and some other issues.  Maybe those were early versions or a bad batch, and maybe  the design got tweaked ??  But I have had no problems at all.  I just came back from two weeks in Portugal and have shot over 1500 pictures in the four weeks or so I've been using the camera and it's been bounced around a bunch.  I tried to get the lens error (before I left and after I found the \"fix\") but it never happened.  Maybe if you actually stop the lens from moving or pushed it back?  but that would probably break most cameras.  So either that issue is fixed or some users were being violently rough with the camera to get the error.<br /><br />THe images look great, it's fast and it was great to have along.","My nephew was thrilled to recieve this for graduation.  He took it on his trip to Spain and got great pictures.  Good camera for the price.","I'm a bit obnoxious when it comes to my pictures.  I'm not a professional photographer by any stretch but I'm a mom and I want GREAT pictures of my kids.  This camera delivers.  Point, shoot, get a great photo.  The \"delay\" time is a bit long, but I've used other digitals and found this to be comprable.  Easy to use, takes excellent photos, really what more can you ask for?  I like the fact that this camera is small, but not teeny-tiny; there's still something for you to hold onto to steady the shot.  I really don't have a single complaint about this camera!","I have been using the Fuji E550 for almnost two years, with none of the problems that have been reported by some of the reviewers.<br /><br />Here are the negatives:<br /><br />1) The flash has mediocre range and is a little finicky. If you don't depress the shooting button all the way, it may not flash.<br /><br />2) In bright light, the screen on the back is unusable - it washes out the image. BUT the camera has a fine viewfinder so this is not really a major issue.<br /><br />The positives:<br /><br />1) It takes great pictures. Really excellent.<br /><br />2) It's small, and easy to carry.<br /><br />3) The controls are well thought out and positioned on the camera body. Very easy to use.<br /><br />4) It has several automatic modes - sports, landscapes, portrait, etc, or you can use it on manual. I always use one of the programmed modes.<br /><br />5) The video option is not bad at all - my twelve year old (now 13) uses it.<br /><br />I was so pleased with this camera I bought one for my administrative assistant about ten months ago, and she is very happy with it.<br /><br />At it's current price I think this camera is a bargain. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the weak flash.","I have had the camera about 2 years and all in all it is an exceptional camera for its many advanced features. The designers must have felt that because of the wide range of f-stops, very slow/fast shutter (3sec to 1/2000) and the fantastic film speed range (auto or ISO 80 to 800), why have a large flash. The E550 is designed as a available light camera. True the flash only works when the autofocus and autorange feature can work. It must see something well or you get no flash. Somethings I like are the unlimited movie time. (card limited)  The almost none existant shutter delay is very unusual in a digital camera. While driving I can pick up the camera, turn it on and shoot with one hand a shot of a deer on the side of the highway. I just preset it on speed prioity shutter, preset on 1/800 or 1/1000. With the dial on top you can set priority to amperture, speed manual or program all. I also like the feature of automatic exposure bracketing. Also the rapid shooting feature to get a object moving. Also I like the feature to prefocus (by pressing the shutter half way down)then waiting for the instant shot. What worked in Alaska to get a whale which was only for an instant at the surface. It is a very capable camera as well as a 'point and shot'.  I have taken about 3000 photos with it. It is a great camera but if not set correctly you may not get a good picture.","I have owned this camera for about 1.5  years now, and haven't had any problems with it.  It has a very fast reponse from turned off to picture taking time, and that is one reason I like it.  Also, it gives a very rich and clear photo under the proper conditions.  I love it for taking pics of the kids.  The only lacking I find is it's power in zooming and no image stabilization.  OTOH camers with higher zoom are usually much larger, so it's a tradeoff.  I find it's not sufficient to sit in my seat and try to take photos of the kids on stage because they will be out of focus and not zoomed in enough.<br /><br />The LCD has a protective cover over it that makes it kind of shiny/gloss, the screen is one of the largest I've seen (I think 2\"), which is nice.  Also no lens cover makes it easy to use and not lose anything.<br /><br />It seemed to use up alkaline batteries so fast it was kind of stunning, but the rechargable type are great, last a long time.<br /><br />The xD cards are expensive, but gradually coming down in price.  They are so small!<br /><br />Other reviews here also good to read.","I have had this camera for only five months and the Zoom Error just occurred a couple of days ago. I was NOT happy and thought that I had a serious problem. So, I jumped onto here to read the reviews and saw that others had had the problem too and I found out how to fix the problem myself and the idea worked! YAY!! Thank you to the person who posted it. It may be a temporary solution but at least I know what to do if it happens again. Overall it's a good camera but if I could go back to before I purchased it I would have bought another camera.","I am quite happy with the camera.  It combines pretty good resolution with numerous features, all at a very reasonable price.  Further, its compactness makes it quite portable.  I like it so well that when mine was stolen, I pruchased another one.","Fantastic camera for the value, features are abundant, comfortable and easy to use on auto settings, more than enough manual options to accomodate improved skill. Received the first one with a bad CCD, Amazon overnighted a new one free of charge - no questions asked! This is the place to buy products.","I was looking for a pocket camera with some useful features, and this camera takes good pics. The macro function also works great. The different functions are easy to figure out and I like the software  better than iphoto.<br /><br />The flash is small and not very useful, however all small cameras with a built-in flash have the same problem.  Using the night option allowed useable pictures in dark settings.  Batteries drain fast, so use rechargeables.","Camera is nice but who in the heck decided to include a crummy 16mb card with it. The 16mb card holds 9 pictures before it is full. Don't find out like me (too late) when you get to a family Christmas gathering and all the stores are closed.....get a bigger card.","(...)<br /><br />Having said that:<br /><br />I purchased my first Fuji Digital in 2001.  It is 3.3 Megapixels and was truly state of the art at the time.  I paid over $500 for it.  *grin*  Yes, technology always gets cheaper!  It has worked flawlessly for over 4 years now without a hiccup.  I am sure I will keep using it as a 2nd \"point and shoot\" digital camera.<br /><br />I have used that Fuji for many thousands of photographs in just about every imaginable situation.  I have a photo on a commerically published music CD jacket that I took with that camera.  I also have numerous photographs on commerical web pages that were taken with that camera as well.<br /><br />So, when I decided it was time to upgrade to a higher pixel point and shoot - I price compared with other brands, but Fuji was the only name I seriously considered.<br /><br />The one flaw that existed in my first Fuji has not changed with this one:  The flash has to be opened manually.<br /><br />A few complaints I noticed in other reviews that don't apply to me:<br />I am not bothered by the USB cover, as I always use the storage card to download the pictures into my computer.  I'm also not bothered by the LCD screen not being able to be easily viewed in bright light.  99% of the time, I do not use the LCD screen when taking pictures.  Since I take pictures with SLR's, I've never gotten into the habit of using the screen - I use the viewfinder.<br /><br />Expensive memory cards?  I don't know where the people that complained about expensive memory cards are shopping at.  It is about impossible to spend more than $50. for a generous sized MB memory card.  I keep 4-6 memory cards going at all times - because, as I mentioned before, I use the cards to download into my computer.<br /><br />The photos are crisp and bright.  They have a lot of depth.  I have found that the black/white mode is something I am using on some shots.  My old Fuji doesn't have this feature.  I did not know if the \"vivid\" mode would be something I would use, as I use Adobe Photoshop for editing any photos that are keepers.  However - it really is very handy and does make colors \"pop\" on outdoor landscape shots that have varied colors of green.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into a pro/con list, or a long detailed review of every feature.  There are already several reviews that do that.<br /><br />I just wanted to give this camera the 5 star review that it deserves.  I'm sure it will be another 4-5 years before I need to upgrade from this camera.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.","I love this camera.  When shoping around, the 2 most important things I was looking for were a short shutter lag time (the time between depressing the shutter and getting the shot), and really good resolution.  I like to crop my pictures as well as enlarge portions of shots, so the 6.3MP with the Super Had was a big selling point right there.  This camera also had the shortest shutter lag of any that I tested at the time.  It's certainly barely noticeable.  Unlike many others, I actually like the pop up flash, since I can choose not to use it.  I dislike the harsh contrast with a flash, and in many cases (such as my recent trip to Europe) there are occasions where a flash is forbidden.  Even in very dark churches, I had good results using the automatic feature with no flash, or the nighttime setting.<br /><br />I also enjoy the feature that allows you to choose either the aperature or shutter speed, and the camera chooses the apropriate complement.  This is a good way to play around with manipulating your shot without having a perfect knowledge of photography rules.<br /><br />I'm perfectly happy with the Xd card.  I'm not sure where all the \"it's too expensive\" stuff is coming from.  I bought a 128MB card at best buy for $20, and it would have been cheaper if I hadn't accidentally thrown away the packaging and thus was unable to send for the rebate.  It hold's about 86 pics on the highest shooting mode, which was more than enough coupled with the included 16MB card for my recent trip.  I actually find myself using the smaller card (which holds 10 pics) more often around the house since I usually like to upload my photos right away.<br /><br />The only drawback I see is the cover to the USB cable.  I haven't lost it yet, but have forgotten to put it back on the camera a few times.  I'm guessing this is why they include 2 in your package.","Pros:  The Fuji E550 takes good pictures in a variety of lighting conditions.  This camera is very quick to start up and lag time between shots is very short.  It's easy to navigate through the menus and the buttons and controls are laid out logically.  The compact size is not a hindrance to using it.  The included software (FinePixViewer and ImageMixer VCD2) are easy to install and pretty straight forward to use. You will probably want a more sophisticated photo editing program for composing / cleaning up your shots.<br /><br />Cons:  It does have a couple of drawbacks.  The memory card that ships with it is way too small. Removing the memory card is not practical so connecting to your computer via USB is necessary. There is a mechanical switch you must use to change between taking photos and viewing or deleting what's on the camera.  I question how long this switch will last.<br /><br />Overall Impressions:  I like this camera and would recommend it.","It's hard to make a decision about this camera as it takes the very best pictures of any camera I have ever owned.  The photos from this camera are significantly better than any digital camera I have ever seen.  That said, there seems to be a general problem with the zoom lens.  I am also waiting for my camera to be returned from Fuji due to the \"zoom error\" mesage and the lens locked in the open position.  It would be important to find out how widespread this problem is in Fuji camera and if widespread, then stay away from it.  If the incidence of this problem with Fuji cameras is no different than that for other brands, then I would definitely recommend it.","This camera is great. When we were looking at them, ones with megapixels over 5.0 were almost $400 and only a 3x zoom. Loved the features with this...was looking for one a little smaller, but this still can fit in a baggy pocket. I have taken 100s of pictures, and get many compliments on them","I have had this camera since Dec 2004 and have been very pleased with its performance.  Quick turn on and fast shutter lag, excellent color and sharpness, nice video mode, and AA battery use make for a great match for me. I have had no problems with mine and my only complaint is that the viewscreen is hard to see in bright sunlight (like many LCDs). A larger starter Xd card would also be nice, but that is easily overlooked when you see the photos.","Very very easy to use, fits almost everywhere, has the best of all worlds in its easy to use features, travels very well.","The E550 seems to be a high quality unit, however, with its many features, it at first seems a little overwhelming.  The quick start up guide should have included instructions on programming the ecard....if instructions were present, they were not obvious.  I've heard that most cards that come with cameras are the smallest in capacity...this is unfortunate...one would think Fuji is more progressive.  I also purchased the \"Fuji Starter Kit\" which includes a nice case, however, the additional batteries and charger were not necessary....live and learn.  All in all, so far, I am pleased with the purchase.","I received this camera the day after I placed my order for it and was ecstatic when I finally opened it.  This is a great camera for beginners like myself.  The operation of it is quite simple unless you are trying to do more than take quick pictures.  The only cons that I have with the camera is the reset time for the flash.  It takes a few seconds for the flash to reset but I was taking pictures of my 9 month old nephew who wouldn't sit still long enough for it to reset.  The view screen is excellent.  When you use the flash the pictures in the view screen are awesome.  It makes the background look very pure and clean.  I haven't had a problem with red eye at all.  All in all, I think this is a great camera and I am very satisfied.  The price is excellent the quality is excellent and Amazon is excellent.  In my opinion, they don't charge enough for this camera!","This camera is very easy to learn to use....the pictures are very sharp and clear...battery lasts a long time...A Great Camera!","I bought a Fujifilm E510 from Best Buy for $299 last year, and I liked it so much, I bought the E550 from Amazon and paid just $5 more for a superior camera.  Both cameras have the same faults that Loren mentioned, yet they are \"keepers\".  I can't believe how clear the pictures are, both in the viewfinder and in print.<br /><br />I also bought the Fujifilm 512 MB XD Picture Card to go with this camera.  With this chip and with the E550 in movie mode, I can take a movie for up to 14 minutes.  With the E510 and a 256 MB chip, the maximum recording was just 180 seconds, and that after reducing the resolution to a small screen size.  The audio playback is very clear and realistic, even though it is mono and not stereo.<br /><br />One irksome thing: I have just one Fujifilm FinePix CP-FXA10 Universal Cradle, and I have the adaptors for the E510 and for the E550.  The adaptors are not universal, and I have to swap them out depending on which camera I plug into the cradle.  Why can't the adaptors be universal, too? (For that matter, why is there a need for the adaptors?)<br /><br />Oh, and the included rechargable batteries for the E550 cannot be used with the cradle.  I have to swap out the batts, too.  So I ordered another set of batts that are compatible with the cradle today.<br /><br />Overall, I love the two cameras.  I like the quickness of the E550 when powering up vs. the E510.  Both take GREAT pictures.","I think Fuji E550 6.1MP is the best of the best. The pictures I took with the camera was crystally clear and high in resolution and not forgetting the video mode.","I will start off with the negative aspects of this camera. I agree with everyone that the flash is flimsy and that the LCD is useless in bright daylight sun. We must keep in mind that an amatuer photography would rely on the eye viewer versus the LCD screen.<br /><br />I've never had any focus problem with low lighting, perhaps that is because I go in and play with the manual controls and set my ISO and aperture. This is not the kind of camera that the average person should pick up for quick point and shoot pictures. A camera like this is more for the hobbiest who knows a thing or two about photographer.<br /><br />This camera truly takes nice pictures and because of the high megapixels I'm able to blow my distance pictures up with little to no distortion.<br /><br />This camera is worth the money for the hobbiest who can not afford<br /><br />one of those high priced SLR digital camera that run at a $1,000 and better.","Bought this camera after reading a lot of reviews (pro and am).Mostly for fast shutter and great quality photos. I can live with focusing problems at low light and lcd not twistable. Love the optional settings. My problem is that in dozens of reviews nobody ever mentioned the fact that a small, light camera is much more difficult to hold steady than a larger bulkier camera. This camera is great for sliding into a pocket, and is only slightly smaller than previous Kodak, but is so much more difficult to hold steady (especially with zoom). I am using tripod a lot more now.","No technical information here.  Just my opinions.<br /><br />This is a fantastic camera!  I have have wonderful luck with Fuji in the past, and they did not let down this time!<br /><br />The recharge rate is very fast.  I read one person say it's 5-9 seconds.  I don't know what kind of watch he uses, but it does not take that long at all!  Even with the flash on!  (Yes, the pop-up flash is flimsy, by the way!)<br /><br />The color is great!  My last camera tended to run in the yellows.  I rarely have to adjust the color with this camera at all.  Same holds true with exposure.  Indoors and outdoors, I rarely have to adjust the exposure when editing pictures.<br /><br />I am still getting to know my camera.  The multi-shot feature takes practice to avoid major blurring.  But, I know I'll get that down.<br /><br />The grip is fantastic.  I can have a firm hold on the camera while chasing my 3 year old son around!  That makes taking pictures of him much easier!  He is, after all, the reason I have this wonderful little camera!","I am a Nikon fan and own Nikon SLR as well point and shoot camera. I am a programmner with love for technology. However, I have hesitated to dive into the digital world due to he low price performance ratio.<br /><br />My requirements are 1) reasonable resolution, 8mp = 35 mm film. The camera got to be at least 5 mp or more. 2) reasonable shutter lag. 3) reasonable price for what you get.<br /><br />Fuji E550 fits the bill. E550 is replacing my point and shoot (I paid 250 6 years ago). With the 50 rebates, I paid 245 for the E550. Shutter lag is .28 sec. topping the Canon A95's 2 Seconds and the miserable Nikon 4nnn cameras. And its 6.1 mp better than both the nikon 4nnnn and Canon A95.<br /><br />On top of other reviewer's comments, I've found picture from the Fuji has very natural skin tone. Great for Kid's picture. Vivid color. Camera is good size for handling. (Small camera invites camera shake) It got more features (some professional features such as auto bracketing) than I expect for the price. The menus system is not the easiest to use in the world. But it is not hard either. As an advance photographer, love this camera. My wife is a pure point and shooter loves this camera. The pictures are better than my old point and shoot.<br /><br />The low shutter lag was very important. A friend of mine bot a Nikn 4100. He complained the long shutter lag causing him to miss picture opportunities of his kids. He then returned the Nikon for an E550. He is one happy guy and praises my recommendation everyday!<br /><br />One important aspect, E550 got low noise ratio at ISO 200 400 and 800. Try that on Canon A95 or Nikon! These high ISO sensitivities afford much more picture taking fexibility for low night shots and action shots.<br /><br />The brand name Fuji have me hesitated. It's not Nikon or Canon. After three weeks, I am sure this is a winner. Of course, there are better cameras at 6, 7, 8 or more mp out there. With E550, you got much more than what you pay for at this time. That's why the 5 stars!","Great point and shoot camera for beginners and intermediates, although experts will not have much use for this camera.  Simple to operate for a beginner and get great pictures out of it, this camera is great.  The 2 inch lcd is very large compared to most cameras and the camera overall has a nice feel to it.<br />Pros:  Decent sized, small enough to fit in pocket.  Great pictures, adjustable options (ie:  flash brightness, shutter speed, flash type, picture quality, ect), little to no shutter lag(time from picture to picture).<br />Cons:  Insufficent flash for objects more than about 15 feet away, no autofocus lamp so autofocus in dim light situations is nearly impossible, Xd cards are still expensive compared to the common compact flash(although they are comming down in price).<br />This is the camera to buy if you are new to the digital camera world, or if you want something just a little bit more advanced than an entry level camera.  If you are not concerned with price and don't care how small it is, you could go for the larger cameras from canon that go for $1000's.  But for the average person, this is the one to get.<br /><br />Update:  After taking this camera on several trips, i have a few minor complaints to add.  First and most importantly to me, the selection wheel thing on top turns way to easily for my taste, leaving it to select a mode other than the one i had selected between putting it in my pocket and pulling it back out.  Indoor pictures and other low light situations suck; the flash is basically useless unless your taking a picture of something about 5 feet away from you.  Still working for me though; these minor complaints should not deter you from buying this camera.","This is my first digital camera and I almost went out of my mind researching them. B&H in New York had a good price on this, and the SONY PSC d150 (a 7mp cam) I ended up choosing the Fuji for the rebate and the larger and brighter rear screen, which I realized made a difference in the fun factor. The SONY was probably built a little sturdier, but the body felt too small and the small rear screen was a little annoying.<br /><br />I LOVE this camera. It was pretty easy to figure out, even though I'm still learning. Within the first hour of use I took a fabulous photo of an amaryllis, which I blew up to 8x10, and it looks professional. The pictures are extremely easy to view after taking as well. A few of the close up shots of my dog came out not in total focus, but for now I'll blame that on me not using the portrait mode - especially since my friend with a SONY PSC D-100 has much worse focus problems than I do.<br /><br />I take photos at 6mp. The detail is stunning. I was satisfied with the video too, except for a weak speaker.<br /><br />Negatives - 1. I've already lost the little plastic cover to the side of the thing. Why isn't is permanently on there? The battery section is also cheaply built. 2. Some people don't like the fact that you have to pop up the flash yourself. I actually like this, because I have always had a hard time supressing the flash on my SLR. This is a matter of personal preference, I like this feature. 3. The flash takes a long time to recharge, and if you are going to take lots of flash pix keep a set of extra batteries handy because it eats them. 4. There is no low light focus beam -- this hasn't bothered me yet, but I guarantee it will at some point. 5. I totally hate the fuji picture viewer software. It doesn't download well. Stick to Adobe photo shop or Microsoft Picture It and you'll be less frustrated.<br /><br />These negatives are rather minor, and unless you spend a lot more money you will always have something about a digital camera that bugs you. The pictures from this camera are just fabulous, and anyone can create a great photo with ease. That's the most important thing to me. I have become a total photo bug in 3 days!<br /><br />After the rebate I paid $280 for this camera. It was a real bargain, and I will certainly be able to use this camera for years without upgrading.<br /><br />Unless you are a person who will hate to pop up the flash yourself, and you can't stand a little long flash recycle time, I don't see how you would be disappointed with this camera overall.","I use this camera mostly indoor with flash. I've taken only about 100 photos with it so far. What I like:<br /><br />- fast start<br /><br />- uses AA batteries<br /><br />- decent flash pictures at wide angle<br /><br />- 2\" LCD<br /><br />- simple to use menu<br /><br />- no shutter lag and quick postview<br /><br />Don't like:<br /><br />- slow flash recycle time<br /><br />- flimsy popup flash<br /><br />- expensive xD picture card (but it's a one-time cost)<br /><br />- when zoomed to telephoto, aperture becomes so small that most flash photos are underexposed. I end up moving closer to the subject to take flash photos at wider angle.<br /><br />- often I would notice a large patch of black object in a photo. It seems dark objects are unusually black, or color seems missing somewhere. Nobody else mentioned this; is it just me?<br /><br />There are no red-eyes in the photos I took. However, all my subjects so far have black eye color, so I can't say how well this works on lighter color eyes. It is defintely better than my old canon S230 (it gives everyone red eyes).<br /><br />I put two 2000mAh NiMH in the camera three weeks ago and after taking 100 photos (more than half of them with flash) I still haven't had to recharge them yet. The camera comes with 2300mAh NiMH -- higher capacity than the ones I'm using.","This is a neat little camera for the price, rebate considered. The video playback is quite acceptable but the audio has a \"bacon frying\" noise in the background. I'm extremely disappointed with this defect. Anyone else out there hear the noise? Even has noise on playback if you don't record any sound.","...Here's EVERTHING you should know. (To skim read: read bold statements). I got this camera for an early Christmas gift last year. I've used it on vacation (GREAT VACATION CAMERA!) Let's get right into it...<br /><br />>>>Design--the design is sleek and sophisticated. Silver and shiny but FINGER PRINTS WON'T SHOW. LIGHT WEIGHT. 2\" SCREEN DISPLAY. all great things about the E550. pics can be up to 12 MEGAPIXELS!!! AMAZING!<br /><br />>>>Start up, shut off---EXTEMELY FAST CAMERA. Start up is about 1.5 seconds. Great for Point and Shoot. Just pop in two AA batteries and a mem chip and you're set. BATTERIES ARE FINISHED WITHIN 45 MINUTES! not good but excusable.<br /><br />Shooting Modes---all on a dial at the top<br />>>Night- for night shots. Automatically sets a long exposure so it can take all the light but the shots come out extremely blurred most of the time. NOT GOOD*.<br />>>Sports- for shots of movement. Automatically sets a short exposure but the scene usually ends up being too dark. NOT GOOD.<br />>>Landscape >>>> nothing special about either<br />>>Portrait >>>>>> both pretty normal to me. NOT GOOD.<br />>>Auto- BEST FOR POINT AND SHOOT. Lighting gets a tad greener that naturally but that's acceptable. VERY GOOD.<br />>>P-(Programmed) goes to a preset shutter speed and a certain aperture. Handy if you plan on taking pictures from the same place over and over again. SOMETIMES HANDY.<br />>>S-(Shutter Speed Priority) USED THE MOST OF ALL. The system it uses...you select a S.S. and the camera selects an aperture. If the aperture number is red, you have to change the S.S. EXTREMELY COOL TO USE. MAKES IT SIMPLE TO TAKE GREAT NON-BLURRED PICS.<br />>>A-(Aperture Priority) sometimes helpful for there are less Ap. settings than S.S. settings so it's faster to find the right combo except sometimes WHEN USING THE A_PRIORITY YOU CAN'T FIND THE CORRECT COMBINATION.<br />>>M-(Manual) you can choose both the Aperture and the Shutter Speed--handy for your own special pictures with weird effects. can be real cool.<br />>>Movie- THIS CAMERA CAN TAKE GREAT VIDEO--THOUGH NOT ENOUGH TO FILL A TV, IT CAN FILL THE SPACE ON A COMPUTER MONITOR. VIDEO CAN LAST FOR A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF TIME! Can be great for precious moments but NOT GOOD WITH SOUND!<br /><br />>>>Menu Features---on the menu button<br />>>Timer-for TEN SECONDS SO YOU CAN GET IN THE PICTURE TOO, two seconds so you don't shake the camera by pushing the shutter button**, and off if you had it on (but after each pic, the timer shuts off, can be annoying if you want to take more than one).<br />>>WB-(White Balance) pretty much the lighting. AUTOMATIC LIGHTING, programmed light (haven't figured that one out yet) SUNSHINE, CLOUDY, LIGHT BULB LIGHT (indoors, most common) and three others that always make everything a different shade of red (strange). CAN'T CHANCE WHITE BALANCE WHEN YOU'RE IN CERTAIN MODES.<br />>>Focusing- Auto focusing: CENTER FOCUS, MULTI AREA (<< most common), AREA--YOU CAN SHIFT THE BRACKET IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN TO ANYWHERE SO IT'LL FOCUS ON WHAT YOU WANT--, Continuous, the camera will continue to focus on things (usually IT'LL FOCUS WHEN THE SHUTTER BUTTON IS PUSHED HALFWAY DOWN) and will use up a lot of battery, even faster! Manual focusing: Um...I don't know how to do it. STICK WITH AUTO FOCUS!<br />>>Photometry-Average, spot, or Multi, I have absolutely no idea what they change...I assume that multi is the best.<br />>>Continuous Shooting-Top 4 (HOLD THE SHUTTER BUTTON DOWN AND WILL TAKE FOUR PICTURES CONSECUTIVELY, VERY COOL) final 4 (hold the S.B. down and it'll save the LAST four pics you take, a little weird but kinda cool) bracketing (takes three pics consecutively under different settings, kinda neat but it has never helped anything) and 40 frames (TAKE UP TO 40 CONSECUTIVE FRAMES BACK TO BACK AT 2 MEGAPIXELS, pretty cool)<br />>>Options- change a few settings (not to do with the pictures) like brightness of the screen and volume of THE BEEPING (which SHOULD BE TURNED ALL THE WAY DOWN can get pretty annoying, each click of a button is a beep!)<br />>>Bracketing- change the range of something, I have no idea NOT HELPFUL<br />>>Sharpness- Hard (For distance photos) normal, soft (closer up)<br />>>Flash- adjusts the brightness; don't really need to be adjusted because THE FLASH IS ALWAYS EXTREMELY BRIGHT! BUT USUALLY UNNECESSARY***!<br /><br />>>>Flash and Marco---change by pressing the buttons around the menu button<br />>>Flash- (Press the button of the left side of the menu) change the flash between...off, automatic, RED-EYE REDUCTION (this WORKS REAL WELL), Slow Synch flash (flashes right at the beginning of a long exposure usually) Slow Synch+ red eye reduction (mixes the two)  IT WILL NOT FLASH UNLESS YOU PRESS THE FLASH BUTTON SO THE LIGHT BULB JUMPS OUT. IT WILL TELL YOU IF YOU SHOULD HAVE A FLASH.<br />>>Marco- (Right side)for close up, on/off. doesn't change much.<br /><br />>>>Special FujiFilm Modes---(not real special)<br />>>Quality- 0.3MP (for tons of pictures) 2MP, 3MP, 6MP (the one I use the most...YOU CAN TAKE 84 PICTURES AT 6 MEGAPIXELS ON A 128mb xD PICTURE CARD 12MP, 12MP fine...A STUNNING 12 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA, THAT PRINTS UP TO 20\" x 15\"!!!! THAT'S HUGE and it's FINE so you can't see the pixels.<br />>>ISO-(Light Sensitivity)80, 100, 200, 400, and 800 at 2MP nothing special<br />>>COLOR- standard, chrome (saturated color, cool) Black & White<br /><br />>>>Lense---<br />>>Zoom--OPTICAL ZOOM IS 4X!! REALLY GOOD! digital zoom (do not use) is 6x. Lense extends from camera about two inches.<br />>>Attachments--PRETTY MUCH NOTHING YOU CAN ADD ON THAT'S CHEAPER THAN $100!!! It sucks!<br /><br />>>>WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LCD DISPLAY, YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE PICTURE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. YOU CAN ALSO SEE ALL OF THE SETTINGS. WHEN YOU PUSH THE S.B. YOU CAN SEE IT FOCUS AND ALL THE SETTING DISAPPEAR. EXTREMELY NICE!!!!<<<<br /><br />>>>Reviewing the Pictures--- you can flip and small switch to change from taking pictures to viewing them. easy to switch.<br />>Display--push to change from seeing the picture with the DAY/TIME to seeing just the picture, to seeing nine pictures (good for browsing)<br />>+/-  push that button to see the specifications of the photo.<br />>Menu Items--<br />>>Erase-single frame, all frames<br />>>Protect-single frame, all frames<br />>>Playback-four modes for viewing all your pictures in a slide show (NOT GOOD)<br />>>Voice memo-USELESS, I think. You SHOULD be able to remember the picture, you took it!<br />>>Trimming-EXTREMELY USEFUL!!! YOU CAN CROP A PHOTO BY ZOOMING IN AND SHIFTING THE IMAGE, VERY NICE TO USE. IT WILL TELL YOU HOW BIG THE AFTER-IMAGE WILL BE<br />>>Options-same as before the other options...<br /><br />>>>it'll tell you if you get low batteries<<<<br />>>>comes with hand strap<<<<br />>>>comes w/ 16mb...pretty much completely worthless <<<<br />>>>comes with two batteries+charger<<<GOOD!<br />Keep in mind the 12.3 megapixel is from the super CCD sensor which means the image is interpolated(pixels are added)<br /><br />*what happens with a long exposure, for instance, cars: if you're in a car taking pictures of the lights of other cars as you pass them, set the exposure real long. the lights will trail behind the car and the effect looks really cool and professional.<br /><br />WHAT I RECOMMEND WITH PURCHASE---<br /><br />1. A TRIPOD, TALL NOT TABLE, BECAUSE WHEN PUSHING THE SHUTTER BUTTON CAMERA TENDS TO SHAKE CAUSING BLUR<br />2. A CARRYING CASE FOR ALL YOU STUFF<br />3. >TWO< 128MB xD PICTURE CARDS<br />4. EXTRA SET OF BATTERIES AND >ANOTHER< CHARGER<br />5. USB PORT COMPUTER CONNECTION, MAKES TRANSFER EXTREMELY QUICK!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINES: GREAT, GREAT CAMERA. FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO EXPIRIMENT WITH PHOTOGRAPHY. THIS CAMERA HAS THE MOST FEATURES OF ALL THE CAMERAS I'VE SEEN! IT'S THE BEST CAMERA YOU CAN BUY.<br /><br />DON'T SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN THE FUJIFILM E550!<br /><br />~T*RIN 5lbscatfood.blogspot.com","This camera is awesome. The start up and shut down time is extremely fast as is the auto shutter speed. What's great about it is that you can choose from 10 different shooting modes that allow great versatility to adapt to just about any situation. Lots of people say that the buttons are shallow and difficult to push but they seem fine to me. Another good feature is that you can view a histogram of the image that displays information about the individual frame. You can also choose how many megapixels that you want with the special Fujifilm button. The zoom is great too with 4X optical. It also zooms even if you look through the optical viewfinder, which I might add is a bit small. The LCD screen is also satisfyingly large at 2.0 inches. I highly recommend this camera for the digital camera enthusiast that wants a camera a few steps higher than a point-and-shoot, with optional advanced features.","I have try many other camer.  I finally settle with this as upgrade from my 2megapixel fuji finepix 2600 which is a great beginner camera.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />use double AA battery which you can get anywhere.  I do recommend use the nimh rechargable batter.  They are cheap anyway compare to those custom battery.<br /><br />6 MP for less than $300 after rebate.(Wow)<br /><br />Good Picture quality.<br /><br />Con: a little bulky. Expensive xd card. Battery runs out fast with flash.  But this is true for all camera anyway.<br /><br />My experience with the camera:<br /><br />I bought a 512 md xd card make by SankDisk right after I got the camer.  However, most my indoor picture turns to very dark.  I spend a lot of time to read the manual and learn many adjustment.  Since I am not a professional photographer, I very have no idea I am doing.  At the moment, I am very pissed with the camera.  I was about to throw it at the floor. Finally,  one day, the xd picture suddenly unreadable by the xd card reader.  I went to circuit city and return the sanddik xd picture and I saw the 128 md fuji xd memory card (made by fuji) on sale.  I bought it and want give the camera last try.  Oh Boy, what a different.  All the sudden, my picture turn out very clear for my indoor and night picture.  I don't know why. I suggest stick with Fuji brand xd picture card for this camera.  I have use the auto mode, with auto iso with geat picture.  For very dim light indoor picture, I manually set the iso to 400, I got very clear picture.<br /><br />Note:  higher the iso, the more noise on the picture.  Howerer, if you are printing, 4x6, you probably won't notice the noise with iso  400.<br /><br />I love this camera now.","Ok.. I wanted a camera that was light, could fit in my pocket, used the AA batteries or the NIMH AA batteries, and of course could take great pictures.  The Canon A95 almost fits the bill, but it used 4 AA batteries while the Fuji and Sony use 2 AA batteries,  and is a little too big and heavy.<br /><br />Anyway, here are the Pros and Cons of each camera.<br /><br />Fuji E550 Pros:<br /><br />Great, very sharp pictures. (6 MP) I blew them up to 8 x 10 on my Epson Photo 700 printer and they were stunning! I have never seen such great output on my printer. The Sony DSC W1 is not even in the same league -- just look at the head shots on the Steves Digicam site and you will see how much sharper this camera is between the E550 and the DSC W1.  As far as color, great color saturation It should be noted that all Fuji cameras tend to shift more toward blue, the Sony shifts more toward green (as do most digital cameras including Canon). Some say this makes grass not look green enough, but to my eye, the grass just looks like a darker green, it still looks green though on a brite sunny day. Skin tones look fine.  I shot a pumpkin on the grass in bright daylight. The Sony shot had a yellow-orange pumpkin with light green grass, the Fuji shot had a very orange pumpkin with darker green grass. The Fuji shot was much sharper. I like the Fuji shot much better. Some say that the 6MP default is too compressed, I just don't see it.  And the default compression allows for more pictures on the 512 XD card (over 300 I think).<br /><br />2 A lens with great range - from 32 mm to 130 mm - goes wider and longer than most others. It is responsive and fast.The DSC-W1 is a 3 x zoom.<br /><br />3. A comfortable grip and a large 2 inch screen<br /><br />4. Lots of modes and options for the photographer to play with-<br /><br />Program mode, shutter priority, aperture priority, sport mode<br /><br />(the DSC-W1 doesnt have any of these) It should be noted that the sport mode is fair at best and does not compare to a real SLR such as the Digital Rebel), night, portrait mode, flash adjustment, white balance, program shift, continous autofocus, etc, etc..<br /><br />Fuji E550 cons<br /><br />The screen is practically unusable in brite sunlight.  It washes out in the sun, images turn too bright and white and washout, you have to use the viewfinder to take your picture in many instances and then review it on the screen by switching to playback mode and cup your hand over the screen .  The Sony screen works fine and you press button to instantly review your picture.<br /><br />There is no autofocus lamp on the camera.  Under low light the camera frequently cannot focus. In other words, you might have to turn on a light. However, indoor shots always come out better if you turn on more background lights.<br /><br />The flash does not always work properly indoors - I am not sure why.  The pictures sometimes have to be reshot because the flash did not fire. Sometimes I have to change my position for the flash to fire. However, when it does fire, the pictures look fine (and sharp)  The Sony fires correctly all the time and has the autofocus lamp to autofocus fine. It also has the instant review button of the shot you took.. which is handy.<br /><br />The Sony unfortunatly always chooses 1/50 of a second when you turn on your flash, the Fuji chooses 1/60 of a second.  That may make it a litter harder to get a clear picture on the Sony.<br /><br /> The Fuji screen is also harder to use in lower light, but it is still more usable than in bright sunlight.<br /><br />The Fuji has a pop-up flash, it tells you you need to pop up the flash, it does not do it automatically (a small annoyance).  The Sony flash is built in.<br /><br />The build quality of the Sony seems better- a more solid camera, well built.  The Fuji seem flimsier, the pop-up flash may perhaps break one day.<br /><br />And my wife will probable hate the Fuji because of the screen being pretty much unusable in bright sunlight and the darn camera flash and autofocus does not always work well indoors under low light.  Of course she still likes our old Canon 2 MP S10 camera (which I was upgrading from).  So.... how to resolve this...... Here is my conclusion:<br /><br />I'm going to return the Sony.. I would have kept it it a heartbeat if it could take the incredible picture the Fuji can but unfortunately it just can't. And for me, it's about how much fun I can have with the camera and how tack sharp and colorful the pictures are that it produces.<br /><br />I'll put up the the shortcomings of the Fuji E550 --- and Fuji, if you read this review...... fix those shortcomings and you won't be able to make enough cameras because these will fly off the shelf.<br /><br />And my wife?  I'll let her stick the the Canon S10.  It's built well and will last for years to come.<br /><br />Loren","This Fuji DC is fantastic! Especially for the fast power on (no more than 3 seconds). But the night version is horrible. I took this camera to a concert, and shot at least 30 pics in night mode. But only got one clear pic. Of course the flash light is powerful, but it useless. Every photo came with double or triple edges even with flash on. I have to say I'm so disappointed with that. Besides, the anti-shake mode is poor and the xD memory card is too expensive.<br /><br />I have to return this camera for sure.","The spec of this camera is very good, but the build quality leaves much to be desired, such as:<br /><br />1.)  Flimsy pop-up battery.  The button is shallow to pop-up the battery and the flash mechanism is built of flimsy plastic.  When you close it it latches only to one side leaving one side higher than the other.  On one camera, the flash stopped mid-way from full extension.  This was the third camera that had some issue with the flash.  IMHO, this flash is geared for failure..........I hop on FUTURE cameras, Fuji will have the flash built-in--no moving parts please--and please no cover sliding doors like other cameras like Olympus or Canon (which also fail)!<br /><br />2.)  USB/AV port has an UNHINGED plastic cover.  When you upload your pics, the plastic cover has to come off.  Since it's unhinged to the body of the camera (unlike the competition), the plastic is engineered to be eventually lost.<br /><br />3.)  Cover handle creaks.  All E550 cameras I tried has this creak on the handle when you gripped it.  The plastic obviously is not glued on proficiently.  I hope on future cameras they use a solid well constructed rubber grip like Kodak for instance.<br /><br />4.)  Uses ULTRA expensive xD cards.  One shouldn't be buying such a camera if they don't fully intend to be using the FULL 6MP (or 12 MP interpolated) for pictures.  Otherwise save your money and get a 4 or 3MP camera!  Since 6MP picture files are large, you need substantial memory size (not to mention a good sized hard drive!).  A 512mb memory card is a good STARTING point.  In this regard, xD cards from Fuji or Olympus cameras cost 2-3x as much as the nearly universal SD or Compact Flash cards.  The pice difference is SUBSTANTIAL enough to make this camera a deal breaker.  For instance 1GB of Compact flash memory is $220+ cheaper than 1GB of xD!....That's enough memoy to upgrade one's camera to a markedly better level!<br /><br />Now the picture quality dings:<br /><br />1.)  No autofocus lamp for dim light pics.  The lack of the lamp causes the camera to take blurry and wrongly exposed pictures.  A AF lamp (like what other competitors have), will solve much of this problem.  The much more expensive brother F810 has the lamp, but it should be included on this model.<br /><br />2.)  Pictures has purple finging.  While smaller amounts of fringing was shown in high contrast outdoor pictures than Canon, for instance, the E550 still had more consistent fringing from pic to pic.  In other words, most of my outdoor pics had fringing--more than even Canon.  Though, when Canon shows the fringe on a picture, it's much more egregious and noticeable on a 4x6\".<br /><br />3.)  Many outdoor pics were overexposed on high contrast scenes.  The effect caused branches, architecture, for instance, to be bleached out or whited out......While many compacts outside the digital SLR have this problem, this camera had a higher than average bleaching.  So bad on some pics, as to be deleted!  The preview LCD won't be of use as it's too small to capture all the bleaching going on. This bleavhing problem was much worse than the fringing.  The fringing is much more forgiveable since it's smaller than the HUGE bleaching going on.<br /><br />4.)  Pictures such as grass shots are blurrier or muddier than competing 6MP cameras.  The Fuji CCD interpolates data differently thus adding detail in a manner that doesn't contribute to better detail.  The Fuji CCDs are very controversial in this regard among the pros.<br /><br />5.)  Flash takes 5-9 seconds to recharge from picture to picture!!  This is absolutely horrendous perfromance compared to other cameras!  By the time your flash is recharged, the picture taking opportunity is usually lost.<br /><br />Camera PROS:<br /><br />1.)  Great specs for it's pricepoint!  Many manual controls for the serious amateur.<br /><br />2.)  Good video.<br /><br />3.)  Glad they use AA's instead of expensive proprietary Li-Ion.<br /><br />4.)  Snappy start-up, zooming, and scrolling through pictures in memory.  One of the best out there in this regard.  Well done!<br /><br />5.)  Small size.<br /><br />6.)  No lens covers to fuss with.<br /><br />7.)  Lens starts at 32.5mm!  GREAT JOB!  Most small digicams start at 38mm which is abyssmal for close indoor or room shots.  32mm is a good repectable widezoom that I hope the rest of the industry will take heed!<br /><br />8.)  Good 4x zoom.  Better range than most 3x zoom cameras.<br /><br />9.)  Good, snappy Fuji colors on pics!<br /><br />All in all, this is a solid camera that will appeal to many on a budget.  I'm a serious enthusiast picture taker, so I will be overly critical with any camera under $1000.  I think Fuji has a near budget classic on their hands if they take my suggestions to heart and make required changes.<br /><br />For me, the flimsy flash, creaky handle/construction, expensive xD cards, and bleaching/fringing in pictures is enough to supercede a purchase.  If these issues aren't important to you, then you should be very happy with this camera.  All in all, one of the better cameras in its pricepoint.","I was very skeptical of this camera. Since Fuji is not considered one of the \"top\" brands, and this camera has so much for the money. But I went ahead and ordered it, and have not regretted it for one minute! Unless it disinegrates in my hands in 6 months, this is an awesome camera!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />*Obviously, the 6.3MP (not 6.12) and 4x zoom<br /><br />*2\" crystal clear LCD - so much better than 1.5\"!<br /><br />*Long range flash - I think the manual says up to 10', but I had no problems even at about 15'.<br /><br />*Super fast start up - takes <2 seconds.<br /><br />*Will take standard AA batteries - they only last about an hour, but if your waiting to recharge, they'll get you through.<br /><br />*I like the size - it's a little too big for a pocket, but it gives me something to hold on to. I looked at a Canon Elph and it just felt too small!<br /><br />*Very solid. Doesn't \"feel\" cheap at all.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />*The flash takes FOREVER to recharge! In sunlight, the camera is ready to take another picture in <2 seconds, but if you're using the flash, be prepared to wait about 7 seconds!<br /><br />*I'm not real crazy about the pop-up flash. I'm afraid it will break.<br /><br />*It might be like this on all cameras, but the manual wasn't very useful. On advanced features, it would tell me things like HOW to change the aperture, but not WHY I would need to do that. But for normal photography, the camera is very easy to use.<br /><br />I have no idea why this camera is so inexpensive (I got it for $325 from an internet company). It must just be that Fuji has not made a name for itself yet in the digital camera field. But I highly recommend it!","Love using it.<br /><br />Very versatile, very clean enlargements.<br /><br />Great video.<br /><br />Fast response.<br /><br />Intuitive, very easy to master controls.<br /><br />Poor optical viewfider.","The Fuji E-550 digital camera is Fuji's first digital camera aimed specifically at the consum digitaL camera market. It delivers a lot for the price. With 6mp and 4X optical zoom this digital camera has a lot of advance features such as a raw image format and a manually set white balance in addition to the white balance presets.<br /><br />The E-550's digital photo output is great. Like so many digital cameras its flash unit only operates out to about 10 feet with the normal settings. However that range can be extended up to 25 feet by adding a slave flash and some camera adjustments.<br /><br />All in all, this is a high value camera. You get a lot of quality, features, and flexibility for a very fair price. I would buy another without any hesitation and I do enthusiastically recommend the Fuji E-550 nto others."]},{"name":"FujiFilm FinePix S5100 Zoom (FinePix S5500)","amazon_reviews":["I recently inherited my dad's 11 year old fujifilm s5100 and it still has amazing quality.

I'm going to upgrade to the 14.2 megapixel they're offering, but I'm hooked on Fujifilm products.  They have all the features of the Canons, Minolta's, and Nikon's w/o the hefty price tag.  Duh!!!","I just received mine and love it.  Not a bad deal for a lower end style digital camera. I am definitely an amateur who just happens to love shooting pics.  The Fuji S5100 gives me the option to both point and shoot OR adjust for manual shooting. This is my 3rd digital camera and really was not looking to get anything besides a Canon or Sony, but am now a believer.  Additionally, I saw in a Consumer Report today (June 2009) that Fuji ranks higher than Canon and Sony for less repair issues (only 3%).  Also, be sure to see my pics here under recently added (not most popular).  I shot them the same day I got the camera.  I just went for it and think I got some really great shots.","As an owner of a Pentax K-1000, I really like this Fuji S5100.  Its simple to use, and the prints come out very nice. I like the feel of this camera because it feels like my SLR. I find the little pocket digitals no different that the old Kodak pocket camera.  I like the S5100 for its options and ease of use.<br /><br />Congratulations!","I love the size, features and cost of this camera.  It make it so much easier for me to enjoy taking pictures and knowing that it is helping me get the correct focus and obtaining pictures I am shooting for one reason and seeing other reasons I would have taken the same shot had I seen it originally.<br /><br />Great price!","I love this camera so much, I purchased it three times.<br />It has great zoom, nice clear pics on 4MB selection, nice video too.  It comes with a 16MB card, which, now that the hi def pics arent 2MB each (about 800k), you can fit more than 8.  I purchased a 1 GB card that can hold several hundred pics, as well as decent, good quality video.  It comes with FinePix software which allows you to make a Video CD, DVD, etc.. which is nice for special occassions.  I purchased a USB XD reader with this to take the card out, and connect directly into my laptop, rather than physically connecting the camera to the laptop.  The downside is the long startup time, and its hunger for batteries.  Use Energize Lithum batteries.  They last at least 50 times longer than regular batteries.  Long distance inside pics with ok or dark light dont come out very well, unless you set it for nightpics, and have a tripod.  The manual settings are good if you know what they mean.  I like the shutter delay while photographing fireworks with a tripod.","The camera itself if fine but please beware.  They show the product weight at 20lbs meaning you will be charged over $40 to ship when the box it arrived in shows 3 lbs.<br /><br />That said, I really like the camera, it is going to take a while to get through all the features but seems to be far superior to the standard point and clicks I have been using.","Yes, I am slow to make this review, maybe because I spend a great deal of time using this camera.<br /><br />The ONLY thing I would like to have changed, is a rechargable pack.  At first I burned thru many batteries.  I switched to rechargables, and find that I still use a great deal of power, (I shoot often with the flash,) but now I can recharge the spent batteries after each session.  I use the charge of 12 AA's in a 3 hour shoot.<br /><br />I use this camera for studio work and it has served me well for a good number of years already!","I purchased this camera 2 or 3 years ago, and still use it as if brand new today. This camera is excellent for amateur hobby photographers like myself, as it has a lot of functions that can be accessed by the click of a dial, such as shutter speed, aperture priority, manual function, etc. To be honest, the camera has so many functions that I don't even understand how to utilize it to its full potential. If you are well versed in photography, this camera is for you. If you are just a point and shoot kind of person, this camera has too many functions that it wouldn't be worth it. I purchased a 1G memory card that will store over 1000 pictures (the camera comes with one that only saves like 20 photos). The software is easy to use and has nice photo viewing and editing capability. The only caveat is that the size makes it too bulky to take along everywhere so it can only be used in planned outings, not something you carry around with you daily, thus stripping you of your random photo op. One other thing that I have trouble with is that if the settings are not perfectly adjusted in some low light situations, the pictures come out blurry. But it does take really great flash photos and some settings make the night look like daytime. You really just have to play around with the settings if you are an amateur like me, but once you get the hang of it, it's awesome. I love this camera and the quality of the photos is near professional.","Had the Fuji S5100 exactly one year now.  Meant to write a review after our Hawaii trip last year.  Just back from second annual trip and remembered that I hadn't entered a review yet.<br /><br />First - you'll be more satisfied the more you use it.  This is my 5th digital camera and first Fuji.  It's really grown on me.<br /><br />My wife rarely uses it since I take virtually every photo.  But when she does, I just set it to AUTO, remind her how to zoom, and find that the pic's are just fine.<br /><br />I use a 512mb xD.  I routinely fill up a card on one set of batteries (almost all of my shots are at the 2mp setting which are just fine for most any purpose).  But beware - use only high quality digital batteries. If you are on a budget, here's a surprising find - buy the Kirkland 40-ct box at Costco.  It's only about $11 and they are conveniently shrinkwrapped in 4-ct bundles - great for packing an extra set.  These are far better than any other generic or store brand versions and rival the special batteries for digital products.<br /><br />With a 512MB card, I never deplete batteries by reviewing/deleting photos in camera. Download using a card reader and do your purging on the PC instead. Shots you might have deleted using the LCD may turn out to have an interesting look when seen on computer. And, unless you really have to use the LCD, learn to use the viewfinder it matches the final shot pretty well and it's more discreet.<br /><br />Here's a fail-safe insurance tip for good shots. Use fast shutter mode. There's a special button for this on the top of the camera.  This allows 3 shots at a time in rapid succession.  You can select first 3, last 3 or bracketing mode. I use last 3 for almost every photo. Just depress the shutter and the camera starts shooting. When you release, the last 3 shots are saved.  I always find at least one keeper. (bonus tip - only in AUTO mode, you can squeeze off up to 40 in a row - try it at knee level while following your toddler or during the last 10 yards before a finish line).<br /><br />I get incredible indoor shots without a flash, using Sports mode with fast shutter while increasing the ISO to 400. Be sure to resist the urge to zoom too far, the shots get darker and fuzzier in dim light.  Use widest mode and move yourself closer.  Great for photos of the talent show without  distracting the performers with a flash.<br /><br />I recently discovered a cool new technique using Continuous AF and Aperture mode.  Open up the Aperture to the highest level, set your ISO to 64, and find a still subject with an interesting background.  You'll get an ultra crisp detailed view of your subject with the background blurred slightly.  Very professional!<br /><br />I use a tiny 6 inch tripod for night shots.  There are two timer modes.  One for 10 seconds and one for 2 seconds.  Use the 2 second mode when you are not in the shot.  Be sure to use bracket mode to squeeze off 3 shots in a row. You'll get one regular, one brighter, and one darker shot to choose from later.<br /><br />One technique I started using is utilizing more candid shots with less posing. You can turn off the beeper and false-click sound using Set Up mode so your subjects are less aware. While getting the family to line up for a group shot, try squeezing off a few fast-shutter shots as they are moving around.  You can quietly zoom in on a smaller group and get some very interesting and touching photos and they'll never know.<br /><br />I think it has a relatively fast response time.  It helps a lot if you can frame your shot before hand but it's not really necessary.  Just squeeze half-way down so that all you need to do is squeeze all the way at the right moment.  When I can't frame the exact shot, just pick a spot approximately the same distance and frame that as a substitute.  This works well when there's lots of light.<br /><br />Why won't I give this 5 stars?  It's a bit too big to be ultra portable in a briefcase or purse (I travel a lot) and I find that some colors appear bland. I fix a fair amount with a photo editor. But it's still my favorite camera.","A little background first...<br /><br />This was an upgrade camera for me, just over a year ago.  I was in 35mm format for over 20 years.  I used a Pentax K1000 body and several different lenses, tele-converters and filters.  At work, I've had 4 years experience with a Fuji Fine Pix 2MP \"point-and-shoot\".  It was provided by my work and was very durable (it had to be, as I am in Construction Engineering).  When I decided to switch \"personally\" to all digital I was very cautious.<br /><br />I first looked for pic quality and durability.  From an \"advanced-amature\" photographer's point of view, this camera is great !!!<br /><br />This camera never leaves my side.<br /><br />It travels with me everywhere I go.<br /><br />It is extremely durable as it is mounted to an \"Ultra-Pod II\" and I carry it over my shoulder (I don't keep it in a bag).<br /><br />It provides me OUTSTANDING QUALITY POHOTGRAPHS (close, far or fast: work or play) at a very reasonable price.<br /><br />It takes reasonable video (considering my 35mm took none at all).<br /><br />It is easy to use and learn (even for an old 35mm guy).<br /><br />It is lightweight and power usage is not an issue (NiMH is the way to go).<br /><br />I take close to 20,000 pics a year for work and play.  I am always experimenting with this camera and it's limits.  I am so pleased with this camera (and the previous Fuji I used) that my next upgrade will be a Fuji as well (looking to 10MP).<br /><br />For the $$$ you can't go wrong!","This camera's flaws may irritate more seasoned and adept photographers than me. However, for the amateur looking for room to grow, this camera is a great value for the money. I was drawn to the S5100 because of its automatic and manual settings. I figured that I could slowly learn how to use the more advanced functions while still being able to take photos. The 10x optical zoom is a major bonus. The colors fade a bit at full zoom, so you won't get the same terrific, sharp images as at lower magnifications, but it still beats the heck out of the point-and-shoot 3x optical zoom cameras.<br /><br />I've owned the S5100 for over a year, and though I love it, it has a few significant shortcomings:<br /><br />1. While it takes beautiful pictures in bright sunlight, indoor non-flash pictures taken without the aid of a tripod are often blurry. The S5100 takes some beautiful night shots (with tripod), however.<br /><br />2. Shutter speed on automatic settings is slow, and start-up once you turn it on takes too long. Also, if you turn the camera off, and then immediately turn it on again, it often won't turn on. You need to wait a beat after turning it off before turning it on again. It's not that annoying because you don't often need to immediately turn it back on after turning it off.<br /><br />3. The view-finder is digital, not optical. When you look through it, you're seeing a digital image, and not actually looking through a lens. I find it difficult to see the image in the viewfinder, so I only use the LCD screen. Unfortunately, the LCD screen is hard to see when it's very sunny.<br /><br />4. It's hard to take incognito shots, because the camera makes a lot of noise (beeping when it turns on, and an artificial film-camera-type \"click\" when it takes a photo).<br /><br />That said, I love this camera and would buy it again. I live overseas and often post photos of my travels online to send to friends and relatives back home. They always ooh and ah over my photos and frequently ask what sort of camera I have. The S5100 offers a lot of bang for the buck.","Having been engaged in 35mm photography for 32 years, I approached digital photography with great reluctance.  I knew there would be an essential learning phase with less than ideal pictures, like my playing with a brownie for a few years as a kid -- this further delayed my plunge.  Finally, an upcoming trip overseas compounded with the knowledge of what airport metal detectors do to film forced the issue.<br /><br />My choice was cinched by some pictures we acquired from a friend of papal conclave 2006.  We ran them as a screen saver, and I was much impressed by the sharpness, color tonality, and depth of field -- especially in cloudy day pictures of crowds in public squares.  Faces far into the background were discernable.  I asked what was used and it was this camera.  At the camera store I was heartened to see it felt like a mini SLR in the hand, had a nice big viewer and uncomplicated, straightforward controls.<br /><br />The learning phase in the backyard and around town gave me some doubts.  Lack of no-shake feature is the model's biggest downside; a lot got blurred especially using the zoom feature on moving subjects.  Some of this you learn to shake out using point focus, but you still are going to lose a few  precious moments despite your best efforts.  Nor with the limited equivalent ASA range are you going to be able to get the sort of pics in museums or dark old cathedrals you are used to with a good SLR and high speed film -- but remember, this one is a starter.  This thing is a monster battery eater, too:  always carry 2 fully charged replacement sets with you.  On the plus side, choice of black and white and chrome mode is very nice feature, and the built-in zoom has a very decent range and performance on stationary subjects.  Speed of use may or may not compare well to other digitals, I don't know, but its a whole world superior to my old world.  There is a rather steely patina to even the best color images, I see now after viewing hundreds, but that's a decent trade-off for the general ease of use and clarity.  Incidentally, the lens on this camera gives you a lot more than what you would expect from a 4 megapixel rating.<br /><br />Back from Europe this week, I have 2000+ jpegs (the keepers) all of very high quality, an achievement I could not have come close to, I am sure, either with old film camera or with most other starter level digitals.  The continuing issue of shake and blur I surmounted by simply multiple shooting a lot (sometimes 5-7 images); you can erase them almost as quickly as you shoot them, and come to see this as a small nuisance in the bigger trade-off.<br /><br />I do not plan to spend the rest of my life with this level digital camera, but even after I move up I think I will keep it around for sheer utilty and ease of use in the general every day world.  For the price, this is about as good a deal as one can hope for.","I bought this item for my Wife for her birthday in March 2005, the camera responds slowly and 3 months after we bought it the only movable item which is the right in front with the little silver push button on it Fell out.  This made the camera virually unusable and sitting on my desk until we found out that to get this part fixed and installed would be another 100 dollars. Getting a receipt from my credit card company took 2 weeks and any response from Amazon and JR music world was fruitless.<br /><br />I am now waiting for 3 different companies to respond so that i can get this thing fixed under warranty.<br /><br />To be Continued...","Takes good photos except in odd or low light conditions - then they are very grainy. Good camera to familiarize yourself with f-stop and aperture settings. I wished I'd purchased a digital SLR though.","I purchased this camera a year ago and have loved it.  I don't know a lot about cameras and I mainly wanted something that would be easy to use with a decent zoom.  I have been able to take great photos with it and virtually everyone I come into contact with loves how the camera works and wishes they had one of their own.  The camera was very easy to learn how to use and the photo quality has been excellent.","I have had this camera for about a year now.  It was the best purchase ever!  The zoom is incredible, and 4.0 megapixels is just perfect.  The distance of the flash is great too!  This is an incredible camera and is WELL worth the money!  I have had no problems, or anything that has been negative about it whatsoever!","My last camera is a 35mm point & shoot auto-focus, auto-everything.  That's great for me, because I don't want to have to work at taking pictures.  My wife, however, has taken classes and wanted a full-featured camera when we went digital.  On the other hand, I'm an almost-expert at digital image editing, while she wants a simple \"Download\" and \"Print\" buttons.<br /><br />This camera gives us the best of both worlds.  I can set it in full-auto and take great (albeit simple) pictures.  She can set settings to her heart's delight and take more artsy style pictures.  The pictures are great either way, and the camera is easy and fun to use.<br /><br />The downside is the software.  I wasn't expecting anything like the full version of Photoshop, but I did expect something easy to use.  I don't think it should be hard to take a picture at 4MP, download it to my computer, then resample it down to a much smaller file size to email it.  This is entirely too cumbersome, anti-intuitive, and downright painful to do with the Fuji software.<br /><br />The camera itself is great, but plan on lots of time and aspirin when you go to download the pictures to your computer, and even more if you want to do anything more with the pictures.","I originally bought this camera for the 10x optical zoom as I do alot of range shots, and the assortment of features was very appealing.<br /><br />Since its purchase the camera has been superb in many aspects, great color with out much fuzzyness, decent to good battery life (I think I took 2 days of heavy use hmmmm maybe around 40-50 shots before the batteries got to low to function), and it was light weight.<br /><br />The only thing I might say that could possibly be taken as a negative is that you should get a tripod if you do not have a very steady hand. Although the camera does has a moderate anti-shake feature if you are not good at staying steady.... you can get some fuzzy shots but not many.<br /><br />I would difinately recommend this camera to my friends and others looking for a good camera.","I've had my Fuji S5100 since the end of August. I actually got it for a grand total of $250 from another major online media store, and that cannot be beat! I love it so far, and yet I have not yet \"scratched the surface\" of what it can do, I'm sure. I am still learning how to use the various manual settings that are available, but I have already taken so many great macro pics as well as everyday pics. The color and details are excellent. The camera is so easy to use and is light but sturdy. If I had to make one criticism it would be that right off the bat you need to purchase a larger memory card, plus all the rechargeable batteries and something to transfer the pics with. Those items add up quickly to about another $100 on top of the camera price. I feel the camera should come with some if not all of those things. I bought the little Fuji USB reader though instead of an A/C adapter and it is the coolest thing I've ever seen. This camera is serving me VERY well and I highly recommend it.","Acabo de comprar esta camara y la verdad que me gusto mucho, el zoom es muy bueno y las imagenes de una gran calidad, tiene sus detalles, como el que no puedas usar el zoom dutrante el modo de video y por otro lado es un poco complicado el uso del balanceo de blancos, pero la verdad es muy buena camara, eso si... No es la mejor (por esteprecio) acabo de encontrar la Canon Powershot S2, no no no, esta si no tiene madre, es de 12X optico, tiene estabilizador de imagen es estereo y mientras grabas video puedes usar el zoom y capturar imagenes, y la verdad por 200 dolares mas creo que mucho mejor compra, ya estoy pensando seriamente en vender la finepix y comprarme esta, algun interesado?<br /><br />Saludos","Pros:<br /><br />*Excellent zoom for the price<br /><br />*WILL work with 1gb xD cards, but not recommended with the movie recording feature (camera may overheat).<br /><br />*Very light and easily fits in my small hands.<br /><br />*Wannabe SLR means that you are actually seeing what the lens sees, even if it's not really an SLR.<br /><br />*Excellent intermediate camera - enough adjustability for learning photography, not as spectacular as a more expensive model...definitely what I needed, since I wasn't really sure that I would really use the features.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*Both viewing areas (large screen & eye piece) are digital. And both have a split second freeze-frame when you push the button. Ok for most circumstances, but miserable for action shots where you need to follow the target.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br /><br />*Get large xD cards. The 1gb card is the best deal, at about $90 right now.<br /><br />*Get a strap pad of some sort if your neck chafes easily.<br /><br />*Get rechargeable camera batteries...this camera uses remarkably little battery juice, but at 4AA a shot they can get expensive!","i gave this camera 4 stars because it did not allow me the opportunity to photograph things really close.  i'm a total novice and i bought the camera after much research because let's face it,...it makes more economical sense to go digital when you have a family and 2 growing little children.  the time and convienence of this camera are astounding and despite the way it looks it is increadibly lightweight. no more running to the store for 35mm film or to develop pictures,...it's all in the palm of your hand.  it is sooo easy to use for those of you that are intimidated by the lengthy directions that you get with major electronics.  there is a quick start sheet that shows you the basics.  i've opted to purchase a seperate lense that will allow me closer shots as i am a tarantula hobbyist who likes to photograph my specimens.  however for everything else this camera really does it all.  the price for me was hefty but i do go by the saying that you get what you pay for.  i got a nice $50 rebate through fuji.  their website is not the greatest but overall i'm pretty pleased with this camera.","I read an article about this camera and the CEO of Fuji before I purchased this camera from AMAZON.COM. The CEO of FuJi said, \"We wanted to make a Camera that would appeal to those consumers who wanted a great camera at an under $400.00 price\" I believe his goal was met and by far surpassed his expectations. This camera is selling like hot cakes!!! I waited for over a month from Amazon to receive this camera.....it was worth the wait!!! I have a fuji 2 meg camera that took great pictures but did not come close to the features of THIS CAMERA. I doubt there are that many people who need a camera with more then 4 meg(larger then 8 1/2 by 11)and better detail then this camera can offer. If you're looking for a camera with great detail, self contained 10X zoom and can be used by anyone in your family, novice or not...for the price you can't beat it.","This site I stumbled upon has an excellent detailed review.<br /><br />[...]","I ordered this camera, its the same one a friend of mine has and loved hers while I was on vacation so I decided to buy one of my very own, I ordered it on day 2 of my vacation and thought to save a little bit of money and go for he free shipping that is offered... it isn't that grand... I have yet to recieve my camera despite ordering it several weeks ago... I have never waited this long for anything from AMAZON before... good grief people are you making the darn thing from scratch or what????","Let's be completely honest about the downfalls of this camera...<br /><br />1.  It has slightly noticable vignetting in some cases (i.e. shooting a clear blue sky) but nothing that can't be fixed easily with a few clicks of a photoshop brush.<br />2.  It's zoom from about 8x-10x is almost useless (at least with my tests)<br />4.  It's high-rez video recording has too many artifacts (too compressed) for my tastes...<br /><br />However, I still love the camera.  Let me list the ways.<br />1.  It feels great in your hand<br />2.  Its manual mode is incredibly easy to use and gives you 5x the picture-taking capabilities of other cameras in its class<br />3.  the ability to attach standard lense filters is unheard of at this price.  I use a UV filter and it gives outdoor photos an extra edge.<br />4.  If you are lucky enough to own photoshop CS2, you can edit in RAW > a feature almost unheard of for under [...].<br />5.  I have made some beautiful 8X10 prints that look astonishingly clear.<br /><br />You're pratically stealing this camera with the mail-in rebate bringing the final cost to [...].  If all you need is a max 8x10 enlargement, this is about the best buying decision you can make for the money.<br /><br />good luck","I was looking for a digital camera to replace a 2.1 megapixel camera with the features and feel of a film SLR without breaking my checkbook and I found what I was looking for in the S5100. I can get great pictures in auto mode and in auto even my wife (who is electronicaly challenged!) is able to use it with outstanding results (even on a moving motorcycle).  The camera has a wide variety of features that I use to get the shots and quality I am looking for.  The 10X optical zoom was a major feature that I was looking for and it provides closeups that are crisp and clear.  Photo quality is excellent in all modes and I feet it is an excellent value in a camera that goes for under $300.  It compares very favorably with cameras that a few of my friends, who are professional sports photographers, use and out shines or equals many cameras that cost twice as much.<br /><br />It takes a bit of reading to fully understand the functionality of all the features but the menues and features follow a relatively simple logic and with a little practice, they are easy to use and master.  The manual is clear and easy to follow.<br /><br />This is not a beginners camera but Fuji has made it easy enough for the interested novice to get excellent results with a very small learning curve.  While it is not a pocket camera, it is small and light enough to carry and not get in the way.  The xD memory cards are a little expensive but you can get over 150 on a 256 card in the highest quality mode.<br /><br />I obviously am very impressed.","I've recently purchased this camera to replace a canon S330 and Canon G5. This camera's highlight, also the reason why I bought this camers, is that it has 10x zoom. Other postive aspects, it does not drain battery and it uses AA batteries, which means when you run out, you can pretty much purchase them anywhere and get back into action. The negative side is that it does not take pictures as well compared with the Canons in darker areas. The LCD view finder is smaller and not as clear as the canons. When used all 10x, it has a problem with auto focusing. But with the price tag on its quality, one cannot really complain, compared with other cameras with 10x, you are really getting a good deal. Also, of course, quality compared to the G5 is lower, but the G5 still cost over 350 bucks while this guy cost is around 250. I purchased an adapter ring 55mm to 52mm and all my Canon lenses fit perfectly for this camera. Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this camera with its price vs value.","I recently purchased this camera for my wife .... well it was a Mother's Day present, but it quickly became one of my favorite toys in the house....<br /><br />Anyway, this is our second digital camera, this one replacing the family's Sony DSC-P71 3.2 MP. The Fuji blows away the previous camera that we had, image quality far surpassing my expectations.<br /><br />Although an avid photo taker of my children, I had really never had professional photo training.... with this in mind, I did some research, and came up with the Fuji S5100 as the best camera for my budding photo craze... I am very pleased by the camera's Look, feel, and overall weight balance. Image quality is exceptional especially for a 4MP camera, I have found it takes photos at the quality of a higher MP camera.<br /><br />Price was incredible... $314 on sale at Best Buy + $50 rebate from Fuji = $264... a steal, considering that I resold our last camera for $140... overall net cost to me was $124.<br /><br />Again, this is our first more serious digital camera, and love it... at thisi point would definitely buy another Fuji product...","I replaced my ancient Olympus, 26 years old, that I had fully outfitted with lenses, etc. with a Fuji Finepix 3800.  I was very pleased with this, with one exception. I missed the ability to change films speeds from the SLR film world.  I moved up to the 5100 and have not stopped being amazed with the results. I bought a wide angle lens to increase the options with this.<br /><br />Today I bought a 3100 model for my daughter.<br /><br />I have complete admiration for all the Fuji products.","We used to own a Olympus D550 and Fuji A303. Both are good cameras juat not good enough. With the newborn baby growing everyday. We feel like we need a better camera to capture all the precious moments. It took us weeks to do research, Finally we decide to get this Fuji Finepix S5100 as it is a SLR camera at a very affordable price. Since it arrival (less than a week), we took more than 500 pictures without reading the menu. They all turned out to be awesome. It is very easy to operate. The movie mode is very clear, we prefer this over the Camcorder. My Husband and I love this very much that use it pretty much every day....The next camera will sure be a Fuji Finepix but at a much higer Megapixel like the S7000...Enjoy","If you have any question about the function or the features of this camera, I recommended this group. I found a lot of answers for my question.<br /><br />[...]","Hi everyone! First, the story: This is my first professional diginal camera. I had two others wich were very simple and I just decided to go for a much better one and, after some research, I picked up this one... and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Now the facts: The camera has en excelent response in several conditions. I mostly take my pictures using the automatic mode and I've got some wonderful ones. Also, the response for taking pictures of moving objects or while photografer is in movement, is excelent. However, the other modes are also great, so I can always get great pictures, even when I still cannot use it perfectly.<br /><br />I have taken pictures facing the sun at sunrise or sunset and I also got some astonishing pictures.<br /><br />A feature that really got my attention is the movie mode. The output is excellent and the sound is magnificent. The microphone can get sounds of up to 7 m (8 yards, aprox.) crystal clear.<br /><br />This is also a very comfortable camera to carry and to grab and the different functions it offers cover most of my needs when it's about taking goos pictures. The zoom is great and the flash it's great too.<br /><br />The software is very useful and the looks of the camera are terrific. My friends think I paid a fortune for it.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like at all is the fact that the flash has to be manually activated. Still, I love this camera.<br /><br />Another thing: the camera sucks disposable batteries very fast, but it can last days using rechargable ones.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful for you. Greetings from Mexico!","I bought this camera on a trip to NYC. I didn't do much research on it before i bought this camera like i normally do on big purchases. Well after i bought it fell in love with it. It's the best camera i have ever owned!!! I recommend this camera for everyone!!!","Thanks MetroPlex for your review - the ISO setting at 64 makes for much better pictures, why don't they tell you that in the manual???<br /><br />I have had my camera for less than 1 week.  I am taking such awesome pictures, I can hardly believe they are mine.  After playing with the settings, I'm now getting much better photos.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, my camera just paid for itself yesterday when I saw a Great Horned Owl sitting about 30 feet up in a pine tree and I took a bunch of pictures of him.  I couldn't see it with my own eyes, but when I downloaded the pictures, you can even see his yellow eyes!  AWESOME!  The macro setting is as amazing, taking a photo of a partridge pea plant, you can see the fine hairs on the pea pod.<br /><br />2 questions:<br />1.  When the lens is extended, does it wiggle a little?  I'm wondering if this is normal, if not, then I want to take it back.<br /><br />I'm still playing with the camera and appreciate all of your comments.  Thanks!","I've read many reviews of the S5100 and have found that many of the pros have addressed the pros/cons of this camera ad nauseam. So I will simply add info that you won't find in most websites:<br /><br />* Use a low ISO setting for reduced noise in the picture. I found the lowest setting, 64 ISO, gives me the least noise in my photos (indoors and outdoors).<br /><br />* You don't need a 256MB or 512MB xD card unless you're going to be outside away from a PC for extended durations. I bought a 128MB card becauase it was inexpensive and holds 66 high quality pics (4MP in FINE mode, 6:1 compression) which is about 3 rolls of film. If I was going to take lots of photos for a week out in some excursion, I'd probably buy a few of the 512MB cards. If you want to just mess around and take snaps for your blog, website, or a school newspaper or project, the 128MB comes at a great price and offers decent storage size.<br /><br />* Definitely get NiMH rechargeable batteries with the highest capacity. For a recharger, I recommend the Maha Powerex. I'm using Energizer AA 2.5 AH NiMH batteries and they've lasted at least a week.<br /><br />* Remember to use the MACRO (Flower) feature for taking very close pics. If I can get the detail off of the center electrode from a Motorcraft spark plug, so can you.<br /><br />* Definitely get a filter!!<br /><br />The lens adapter that comes with the S5100 takes a standard 55mm filter. I recommend Hoya Multi-Coated filters as they appear almost invisible to the naked eye. I thought the store sold me a metal ring until I saw a reflection of the glass. Remember those Lenscrafters Invisibles commercials? The coatings on each side of the glass allows for 97%-99% light transmission with minimal reflectivity. That is why they appear almost invisible!<br /><br />The Fuji lens cap will NOT work with a 55mm filter, so you will need a 55mm snap-in lens cap along with a Sima Cap Keeper II.<br /><br />The filter protects your camera lens from damage. If you crack the filter it is only a few bux to replace compared to a new camera lens.<br /><br />* Get a camera bag. The Fuji holster is a piece of garbage worth only about 1/4 the asking price. Get a decent mini zoom SLR camera bag.<br /><br />Overall, the S5100 is NOT a Canon Rebel Digital SLR, but it worked just like my Minolta 35mm film SLR.<br /><br />You get 10x optical zoom, and up to 36x digital+optical zoom in the 0.03MP mode. At 36x you can actually pick out the details from your subject.<br /><br />The 640x480 VGA video looks spectacular. VGA mode is about 80MB/min while the 320x240 mode is 40MB/min.<br /><br />What remains to be the seen is the durability of the S5100 in a mid to long term fielding.","This camera is nothing short of a mini marvel.Evidentually Fuji did some homework as the 3100 and 5100 take excellent pictures.The difference between the two lies in  (you guessed it!) the features.The S3100 is a auto focus (point and shoot camera) while the S5100 is a auto focus (point and shoot)/manual camera.The s7000 has even MORE features than the S5100.The reason I spent the extra dollars and got the 5100 instead of the 3100 is simple.I like having the choice of switching auto everything off at times.Yeah I know there are Olympus digital cameras,Pentaxes,Kodaks,Sonys,Canons,JVCs and a bunch more but this camera has been good to me.<br /><br />P.S. Although they give you a complimentary 16MB XD card,I'd invest in at least a 256MB XD card and some rechargable batteries...but you knew that didn't you?","I bought this camera to replace a Fuji that I received with my Dell laptop about a year ago. I had abused it horribly taking it all sorts of places and it was starting to die.<br /><br />I received this camera the day before we went on vacation in Florida. I took a whole bunch of pictures of birds (my passion) and my family and was VERY impressed by the picture quality.<br /><br />Battery life seems quite good, I would say based on my impression, the best of the 3 digital cameras I've owned. (Note that I don't use flash a whole lot.)<br /><br />It is easy to pull out of the box and start shooting and get good results, but there is enough \"under the hood\" to make me look forward to really getting to know this camera.<br /><br />The 10x optical zoom is great for nature photography. I just had some prints made of some of my photos--the first digital photos I've liked enough to do so with.<br /><br />From the cameras I looked at, this one is in a class by itself for it's price range. I was looking at $100 more in any other brand to get comprable features.","I just got the S5100 for christmas.  I work as a sports reporter and had been using an olympus stylus 3.2 megapixel camera to take photos to accompany my articles.  The stylus, while an excellent point and shoot camera for vacations and snapshots, just wasnt cutting it for professional looking pics.  The S5100 on the other hand, has been everything I was looking for in a surprisingly affordable price.<br /><br />The controls are fairly intuitive, I'm the kind of person who jumps right in with a gadget instead of pouring over the instruction manual first, and there were very few things that I couldn't figure out how to do just by working with the camera itself.<br /><br />The video and sound quality is absolutely amazing.  If you get a 512mb xd card, you can record movies with sound well over seven minutes long at a 640x480 display, and much longer if you cut the display size.<br /><br />What I really love about this product is the ability to continuously shoot.  Basically, you set the camera to continuous shoot and press the button, the camera will keep taking shots (just under 2 per second) for up to 40 exposures, perfect for my line of work.<br /><br />Also, it's extremely lightweight.  At just under 12 oz, the batteries are the heaviest part of the camera (4 AA).<br /><br />The flash works perfectly, providing ample illumination even at full 10x zoom.<br /><br />You can take video while zoomed in, something else my stylus cant do.  I love being able to zoom in on something far away (again, sporting events) and capture the movement.  My old camera would only record videos with the zoom pulled all the way back.<br /><br />Now for the Cons:<br /><br />-It's a hog for memory on your computer.  A full length video of over 7 minutes comes near half a gig of memory on my laptop (i know, obvious, a 512 mb card = half a gig no matter what media you put on it, so this is something every camera will do).  Just making sure that people are aware that if they're planning on making a series of longer movies or taking a giant amount of pictures, as with any camera, it would be a good idea to invest in a burner.<br /><br />-You're going to need add ons.  The price of this camera alone is amazingly fair for what it can do.  I would highly recommend buying a larger xd memory card to accompany it though.  Depending on your needs, anywhere between 128 and 512 megs should be fine.  You just cant utilize everything this camera is capable of doing with only 16 megs of space.  Also, I'd consider picking up the case and possibly a battery recharger so you don't end up spending a chunk of money every so often on one time use batteries, but that's up to you.<br /><br />In Conclusion:<br /><br />I would highly recommend one of the finepix cameras, and though I didn't pick it out as it was a gift, and I had no previous loyalty to fuji, I'm a believer now.  The s5100 appears to be middle of the road for their non pro series of finepix, you can go higher or lower based on your needs, but this camera really can do it all.<br /><br />It's excellent for a wide field of consumers.  Those who are brand new to digital photography will find it easy to learn, the centering and automatic tools will make taking snapshots a breeze.  The more experienced users will enjoy the bevy of advanced features it offers.  The video makers will enjoy the quality of the images they record.<br /><br />Great camera, moreso when compared with others in its price range.  A wonderful gift.","This is my 3rd digital camera, previous 2 were Canon's.<br /><br />After 2 days of ownership here is my observations of the Fuji S5100;<br /><br />Plus's; great finish and shape, easy to hold, feels great in your hands, secure and solid, 10x zoom is great, aux. filter holder is a nice touch and should be kept on with a skylight filter to keep out dust (except when using flash in macro mode, it causes shadows.) Layout is ok, but could have been even better, I think zoom control would have better placed around shutter as a rocker switch, and the on/off switch placed on back. its a bit more difficult to fumble for W & T switch on back of camera, during use.<br /><br />Minus's; (and they are very disappointing;) In dim light view finder and LCD panel are incredibly dim almost useless (even with the light switch and finder brightness adjustment set at max in the settings menu), unless you shoot in daylight only you will not enjoy this camera. AA alkaline battery life is extremely short, in 2 days 3 sets. Software included is minimal at best, almost useless, I still haven't found and easy way to download pic's from card in camera to PC, I finally gave up and bought a xD card to USB adapter (about $24), which I recommend getting (it is easy this way). Instruction book is poorly written, jumping all over the place, it reminds me of the National Electrical Code, it will take a bit of time to get familar with the functions and you'll probably need to keep the book handy for reference.<br /><br />And one more disappointment when trying to register this product online the Fuji web sight kept telling me my phone number was invalid, after trying it ten times or more in several formats I gave up. I think I know my own phone number Fuji.<br /><br />(does anyone actually try this stuff before they turn it loose on customers?)","After doing a bit of research, looking for a sub-$500 camera that would perform most of what I could do with my extensive 35mm SLR outfit, I decided on the S5100 & I'm happy with my purchase. It's much easier to take along than a larger camera, so you're more liable to have it when you come across those unexpected shots.<br /><br />Battery life is fine, and the fact that it takes standard AA size batteries vs a specialized lithium or rechargable battery pack was another factor in my choice of this camera. Although the standard alkalines included w/ the camera were sucked dry the first day I had it, I picked up 2 sets of 2500mAh NiMH rechargables & they perform great.<br /><br />I printed my first 8x10 the other day & it turned out great - ended up framing it & hanging it in our guest room. At 4mp Normal Mode, the detail is incredible. I highly recommend getting a large capacity xD card, though (at least 128mb.) The 16mb card included with the camera is a joke, holding only 8 pictures at maximum resolution (4mp Fine Mode.)<br /><br />I know there's better cameras out there (I still drool over the $1000 & up digital SLRs), but for the price, this camera will keep you busy & happy for quite a while.","I bought this camera a few weeks ago and am very pleased with it.  When I was looking at digital cameras I wanted a nice optical zoom and wanted something a little bigger than all the tiny ones that are out.  It is shaped nicely and fits well in my hand.<br /><br />I haven't got a chance to play with all the different settings but the basics work very well.  The battery life seems decent to me, but I would reccomend recharables to save money in the long run.<br /><br />I have two 128 MB memory cards which hold about 130 pictures each at its highest resolution, which is enough for me.  It comes with a 16 MB one, but I haven't touched it.<br /><br />I do wish it had an optical view finder instead of a digital one..  it can be hard to see in a bright area, but it isn't impossible to use.  Also, some kind of image stabilizer would have been a nice add on but it isn't too hard to get a clear shot while zoomed in all the way.<br /><br />Overall, it is a very nice camera and I would recommend it.","This is my 2nd digital camera, and it replaced my Olympus 4000, which was excellent, but I wanted more zoom, an electronic viewfinder, and longer shutter times. The 5100 has certainly delivered, with a couply of relatively small compromises. The Olympus 4000 menus and controls are a tough act to follow. However, it seems that Olympus and Fuji share some technology, icons, and ideas.<br /><br /> The physical handling of the 5100 is excellent, with a very secure-feeling, molded grip for your right hand. I found all the control buttons well-placed and easy to manipulate.<br /><br /> When you sort through all the cameras out there, looking for 10x optical zoom, extended grip, and the ability to use AA batteries, the list quickly narrows! I use sets of 2500 mAh nickel-metal AA batteries, and an inexpensive charger.<br /><br /> Another great feature is the included lens tube adapter, lens cap, and cap-keeper. Just screw on a 55mm UV or skylight filter, and you can completely enclose and protect the lens assembly. At the fully wide position, you will see a small amount of vignetting (shadowing) at the corners if you have more than one filter screwed on.<br /><br /> I found the electronic viewfinder to be more helpful than an optical viewfinder, and still visible outdoors in sunlight. You can also read and manipulate the settings without taking your eye from the viewfinder.<br /><br /> I purchased a couple of 512 MB XD cards with the camera. You will really need the extra memory when you take movies. Movie mode, at a full 30 frames/sec, was surprisingly good, even if you can't change the zoom or focus once you start a movie. Startup, and writing pics and movies to the XD card is nice and fast.<br /><br /> The self-timer includes an extra 2-second setting, which is useful for activating the shutter without shaking the camera, such as for long exposures or telephoto shots on a tripod.<br /><br /> The adjustable white balance works quite well. The slickest way to make the most of this feature and to set exposures in manual, is to use a photographic gray card. The one I bought was 8x10 inches. I cut out a smaller rectangle, about 4x6 inches, that fits in my photo bag. One side is pure white, and the other is a special shade of gray. To set the white balance, place the card with the white side toward you, in the same light as the subject, zoom in on it, and activate the manual white balance function in the menu. This assures you of near perfect color no matter what the lighting is.<br /><br /> The manual exposure mode of the camera allows you to set the shutter and aperture quickly, and there is an exposure meter in the display that shows you how your settings compare with the automatic metering. The slick way to set exposure is to use the gray side of the gray card, place it in the same light as the subject, zoom in on it, and set your shutter and aperture until the exposure meter is centered. Once, done, you can just concentrate on zooming and framing to compose your shots, as long as the lighting is the same.<br /><br /> I tested the S5100 with a remote flash unit and a slave trigger adapter, which allow you to create professional, portrait-type lighting quite easily. Unlike my previous digital, the S5100's flash synch and metering seems to be compatible with this technique. You set your external flash to automatic, which is calibrated for a specific ISO film speed and aperture. It's easy to use the aperture priority mode in the S5100 to match these settings. Then using an inexpensive slave trigger device that clips onto the hot shoe of the external flash unit, you can place the external flash/trigger assembly on a mini tripod off to the side and up high, perhaps on a bookshelf, aimed at your subject. The S5100's pop-up flash illuminates the subject from the front, and the slave trigger fires the external flash at the same time, providing the main light from above and to the side.<br /><br /> The power saving function of the S5100 worked just fine as set from the factory. It blanks the LCD/viewfinder after 2 minutes, to save power, and will shut the camera off if you don't press any buttons after that.<br /><br /> A neat feature that is not apparent in the specifications is the ability to record a 30 second (or less) voice memo with each picture. You can record these any time after the pic is taken and stored on the card. When you play back a pic, you can hit a button to play back the corresponding voice memo, which is stored as a separate audio file. You can also hit another button to display all the technical exposure information for each pic, which is automatically stored in each pic file.<br /><br /> So far, I have just a couple of complaints. When playing back pics or movies to a TV using the included video cable, I have yet to find a way to rotate images taken in portrait orientation. Turning your head sideways to watch is not very comfortable! If you know a way to do this, please post it here! As mentioned in other reviews, the manual focus mode doesn't have a distance meter to help you: you have to carefully study the display while adjusting to judge the best focus. This is particularly hard to do in low light.","I have had this camera for a couple of months now and overall am very pleased with it. It is easy to use and a pleasure to use.  It has excellent battery life when used with good NiCad's AA rechargeable batteries (no proprietary battery). It is not a full sized SLR though it looks like one and it is not a pocket sized digital camera but the size fits nicely in between the two.  It has a good grip and feel to it.<br /><br />Pluses include:  Fairly compact. 10X Zoom is great and moves fast. Good range flash. Auto focus works well except when in macro mode. Outside images look very good most of the time. Low light shooting is excellent as is the red eye reduction.  Movie mode is also excellent 30fps 640 X 480and works well in low light. --though you cannot move zoom. Microphone pics up audio well.  Movie mode rivals that of standard DV movie camcorder though you need large memory card of at least 256mb. Menu system is also excellent and easy to navigate. Sharp but small 1.5 inch LCD screen.<br /><br />Minuses include:  Macro mode does not work well no matter what the setting, cannot use zoom during movie mode, comes with only 16mb XD memory card, software not great but if you have imaging software on your computer and Windows XP you do not need to install the Fuji software.  There is no manual focus ring control you have to use buttons on back of camera.  You can an only select between 1, 2 or 4 megapixels modes but can switch between them easily. Small but sharp and clear 1.5 inch LCD screen.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend the Fuji s5100 for beginners to intermediate photographers.  It has good auto (no need to touch) mode and good manual controls for intermediate and advanced users. It is not too big nor too small and fits in the hand nicely. The Fuji s5100 is easy to use, takes good pictures and movies and has a great and easy to use menu system. No proprietary battery system just plain old AA's.  If you use rechargeables they last a long time.","I'm an avid SLR fan and this is my first digital camera.  I love it's SLR like shape without being all that big.  I've been playing with the camera taking video, black and white pix and of course lots of color shots.  My daughter plays soccer so I've been taking action shots and they come out great.  The video is crisp and clear.  I love that I can play the video and pics through my VCR to my TV and also play with them on my computer.<br /><br />The only negative is that the flash doesn't automatically pop-up when it's needed, you get an icon displayed on the LCD or optical viewer telling you the light is too low.  I love the optical viewer's adjustments so I can see without my glasses.  The LCD is small but good enough to give you a rough idea of how the pictures turned out.  Viewing them on a computer or TV is the best way to see the true picture quality.  The software that comes with the camera is marginal, I have other photo software that works better in editing and viewing the pictures.  Also, since this camera uses AA batteries you will never be stuck with a dead battery and no way to recharge it.  I did purchace the 256mb XD card and rechargeable batteries for this camera, shop around, prices really vary!!","After suffering with a pocket-sized digital camera that took great pictures at the cost of very short battery life, I bit the bullet and started shopping for a new model. I had already decided it had to use rechargeable AA batteries and it had to have an optical zoom of 8x or better.<br /><br />In looking at the various models that met the criteria, most were in the $600+ range and quite bulky. The Fuji S5100 looked to be a bit smaller, and the price looked almost too good to be true. When I finally got to see one in person, I was very impressed. So much so, I bought it on the spot.<br /><br />I spent an entire Saturday playing with all the features and shooting pictures at the dog park. I never used up the first set of AA NiMH batteries, even after reviewing and later downloading over 100 photos. I'm still working on the same batteries days later.<br /><br />I really have only two minor issues with this model. Unlike my old pocket camera, it lacks an optical viewfinder, which allows you to turn off the LCD for longer battery life, as well as track  moving subjects accurately. More annoying is that some of the features require two fingers or two hands to activate.<br /><br />Get at least a 256 Mb xD card, get a 4 AA charger that will work in the car or house, two sets of AA NiMH batteries and a LowePro small SLR case and you are good to go."]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX7","amazon_reviews":["This little camera is excellant for a teenager. Simple, easy to use. The only problem was the tiny memory cartridge it came with. No problems with it.","I agree with a lot of the things already said in the reviews, but just wanted to add that this is a great compact one to have as back-up to your more heavy duty digital or 35mm camera. I have always been a huge fan of Leica and the lens on the panasonic lumix models just can't be beat. Other manufacturers like Canon or Nikon may make smaller, cooler looking digital cameras, but the picture quality cannot be matched. I had a Panasonic Lumix DC40 (discontinued now) for a couple of years before buying this one, and knew the lens contributed a lot to the quality of my photos. When I began shopping for a more compact model, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get one with Leica lens. Plus the image stablization system is unique to this line. For most people, 3 to 4 MB is plenty for picture quality but having 5 MB didn't hurt, of course. I compared this to Casio Exilim Z-50, which is also a good compact camera for average shoppers - took pictures of the same object and compared color, texture, depth, etc. - and you can tell clearly that Panasonic takes a more true-to-life, three dimensional colors. People often describe this as a negative factor, saying that Panasonic's color is less than vivid, but I would say this is because we are too familiar with electronically adjusted color schemes. In other words, Panasonic colors are what they are in nature. You can see more texture and depth to them because they are not overly saturated.","I've used several (4 to be exact) Digital Cameras and This is the one that I actually like. I like it so much that I actually bought another one for my wife. The picture is good and screen is big and the battery is not bad. I'd recommend this product to anyone that's looking for a good DC!","this camera is wonderful! i took back several digital point and shoots, simply because they were too slow. but this camera is very quick--you get the pic you planned on taking! the images are very crisp, thanks to this nice leica lens. the battery life is lower than i expected, but i have never been stuck without a camera because of it. the style and feel of this camera is awesome, and the viewscreen is excellent--i highly rec. this camera for a reliable point and shoot!","I just got this camera, I've had several dig cameras before, and I want to name the following pros and cons (please note I will be quick!)<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />really small<br /><br />great big lcd screen<br /><br />easy to use and set up<br /><br />great image stabilization<br /><br />takes good pictures<br /><br />extremely fast<br /><br />good flash recovery, about 2 seconds<br /><br />battery charges in less than two hours<br /><br />con<br /><br />battery life is low, much lower than I expected, it can take about 30 or 40 pictures with flash and then it's gone<br /><br />so, overall that is the only major flaw I find.","The battery life is poor. Don't let this be too distracting, however. A second battery is about the same size as the plastic cases that come with SD cards. It's too bad Panasonic couldn't design a battery that could better handle the large LCD and OIS but I still feel that the extra features are worth it.<br /><br />Images taken without flash in low light conditions are GRAINY. If you mainly want a fun pocket camera for taking non-invasive shots of people in dimly lit locations without a flash, DON'T buy this camera.<br /><br />Given decent lighting, the image qualty is really great. The images have a nice, filmic level of contrast right out of the barrel that I usually have to perform minor Photoshopping to achieve with other cameras. Leica optics!<br /><br />The OIS is amazing. I used an FX7 (as a passenger) in a moving car on a semi-bright day driving over hills and shooting through a dirty windshield (without flash, obviously) and came up with a few traffic shots that really presented well. There was no blur whatsoever even considering the motion of other vehicles captured in the frame.<br /><br />If you're interested in this camera it should be because you specifically want a super compact and feel that the unique Leica lens and available OIS outweigh the battery and grain problems. Don't compare this to a mid-size camera and don't expect it to produce mid-size results in a cellphone-sized package. It will produce reliable image quality. It will not serve as an all-purpose camera for people seeking semi-pro results.<br /><br />Artistic photographers looking for a good pocket black-and-white solution for shooting 8x10s (or smaller) should pay particular attention to the FX7. Casual snapshot takers may just as well be better off with one of the Canons.","I too did a lot of research before buying a pocket digital camera, and I'm so happy with my decision.  First off, this is a beautiful camera!  It it much cooler than any of the other ones I have seen out there, Sony included, and it's not nearly as common.  Second great big plus is this camera is so easy to use.  I had a Nikon CoolPix 4500, and in addition to hating its bulkiness, I hated trying to set anything on the camera and having to navigate a million sub-menus.  Yes, I'm lazy -- I don't want to read thick manual just to figure out how to take video or change the shutter speed. I picked this up and immediately was changing settings, taking videos, resizing pics.  Super Easy!!  The last lovely detail to mention -- almost zero lag time on the shutter!<br /><br />The LCD is giant!.  Yes, it's a battery hog, but I'm pretty good about turning the camera off when not in use and it's not been a big deal.  I may buy a second battery in the future.  I also think 5 pixels is overkill -- would have been happy with 4 -- but it's an easy enough setting to change.<br /><br />Overall, this is money well spent!  I would buy another in a heartbeat!","I'm still amazed at how small this camera is, and yet it still has room to have a HUGE 2.5LCD. Took it to a BallGame the Other Day and almost forgot it was in my pocket. Just as light as the Motorola Razr (my phone). As Leo Laporte says It's the \"Ultimate party Camera\". and boy was he right. I use to have a Kodak, It took Great Pics, but was just to big carry around everywhere, I'm so glad I chose to purchase the Panasonic FX7, It definetely has the looks of an awesome camera, and it's performance is the same as well.<br /><br />** Would Recommend a Second Battery if going on Vacation, eBay got em for $7","This little camera is excellant for a teenager.

I'd recommend this product to anyone that's looking for a good DC!","this camera is wonderful! i took back several digital point and shoots, simply because they were too slow. but this camera is very quick--you get the pic you planned on taking! the images are very crisp, thanks to this nice leica lens. the battery life is lower than i expected, but i have never been stuck without a camera because of it. the style and feel of this camera is awesome, and the viewscreen is excellent--i highly rec. this camera for a reliable point and shoot!","I just got this camera, I've had several dig cameras before, and I want to name the following pros and cons (please note I will be quick!)<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />really small<br /><br />great big lcd screen<br /><br />easy to use and set up<br /><br />great image stabilization<br /><br />takes good pictures<br /><br />extremely fast<br /><br />good flash recovery, about 2 seconds<br /><br />battery charges in less than two hours<br /><br />con<br /><br />battery life is low, much lower than I expected, it can take about 30 or 40 pictures with flash and then it's gone<br /><br />so, overall that is the only major flaw I find.","The battery life is poor. Don't let this be too distracting, however. A second battery is about the same size as the plastic cases that come with SD cards. It's too bad Panasonic couldn't design a battery that could better handle the large LCD and OIS but I still feel that the extra features are worth it.<br /><br />Images taken without flash in low light conditions are GRAINY. If you mainly want a fun pocket camera for taking non-invasive shots of people in dimly lit locations without a flash, DON'T buy this camera.<br /><br />Given decent lighting, the image qualty is really great. The images have a nice, filmic level of contrast right out of the barrel that I usually have to perform minor Photoshopping to achieve with other cameras. Leica optics!<br /><br />The OIS is amazing. I used an FX7 (as a passenger) in a moving car on a semi-bright day driving over hills and shooting through a dirty windshield (without flash, obviously) and came up with a few traffic shots that really presented well. There was no blur whatsoever even considering the motion of other vehicles captured in the frame.<br /><br />If you're interested in this camera it should be because you specifically want a super compact and feel that the unique Leica lens and available OIS outweigh the battery and grain problems. Don't compare this to a mid-size camera and don't expect it to produce mid-size results in a cellphone-sized package. It will produce reliable image quality. It will not serve as an all-purpose camera for people seeking semi-pro results.<br /><br />Artistic photographers looking for a good pocket black-and-white solution for shooting 8x10s (or smaller) should pay particular attention to the FX7. Casual snapshot takers may just as well be better off with one of the Canons.","I too did a lot of research before buying a pocket digital camera, and I'm so happy with my decision.  First off, this is a beautiful camera!  It it much cooler than any of the other ones I have seen out there, Sony included, and it's not nearly as common.  Second great big plus is this camera is so easy to use.  I had a Nikon CoolPix 4500, and in addition to hating its bulkiness, I hated trying to set anything on the camera and having to navigate a million sub-menus.  Yes, I'm lazy -- I don't want to read thick manual just to figure out how to take video or change the shutter speed. I picked this up and immediately was changing settings, taking videos, resizing pics.  Super Easy!!  The last lovely detail to mention -- almost zero lag time on the shutter!<br /><br />The LCD is giant!.  Yes, it's a battery hog, but I'm pretty good about turning the camera off when not in use and it's not been a big deal.  I may buy a second battery in the future.  I also think 5 pixels is overkill -- would have been happy with 4 -- but it's an easy enough setting to change.<br /><br />Overall, this is money well spent!  I would buy another in a heartbeat!","I'm still amazed at how small this camera is, and yet it still has room to have a HUGE 2.5LCD. Took it to a BallGame the Other Day and almost forgot it was in my pocket. Just as light as the Motorola Razr (my phone). As Leo Laporte says It's the \"Ultimate party Camera\". and boy was he right. I use to have a Kodak, It took Great Pics, but was just to big carry around everywhere, I'm so glad I chose to purchase the Panasonic FX7, It definetely has the looks of an awesome camera, and it's performance is the same as well.<br /><br />** Would Recommend a Second Battery if going on Vacation, eBay got em for $7","This is a fantastic camera. I've owned several film and digital cameras and this is by far the best of them all.<br /><br />The size is very small -- very pocket friendly. It is also light. After it's been in my pocket a couple minutes, I forget it is there as I do with my little cell phone. I've been carrying this thing everywhere with me; this is the first camera I've ever done that with. That said, it is also very sturdy. I usually keep it in my back pocket, and it's been sat on many times with no ill effect. It feels solid in the hand. It feels like a relatively expensive camera should feel.<br /><br />It has a ton of features, most of which I've only ever seen on my film SLR. You can adjust the shutter speed, aperture size, etc. I'm definetely nothing more than an amature photographer, but this little thing could allow me to do a lot more. It does have a simple mode that is very easy to use and conveniently hides all the extra stuff.<br /><br />The picture quality is very good. It's a 5-megapixel camera, so you should be able to blow up pictures to something like 8x10 and it won't look grainy. This also means you can crop your pictures to your heart's content and the resulting pics won't look grainy either.<br /><br />The LCD on the back is HUGE! It also has a great quality and is very viewable in direct sunlight. The brightness is adjustable, and their is a \"superbright\" button you can push to quickly increase the brightness for use outdoors. Very convenient. I don't miss not have a viewfinder to look through. Who wants to look through a tiny little window at a scene that doesn't match up with what the picture actually looks like? The LCD is great and the viewfinder is not missed.<br /><br />The only little problem I have with the camera is battery life. After using it on a trip over the course of 5 days the battery signal was flashing red. In my opinion, 14 days of \"vacation\" style usage should be the minimum. In reality, I'm a typical guy and don't take too many pictures away from an outlet where I can charge the batter. The short battery life issue is lessened by the fact that the camera comes with a separate battery charger. Hooray! You can charge a battery, but still use the camera if you have a second battery. I hate having my devices chained to a wall because a battery is charging.<br /><br />This is a fantastic camera, well worth its price. You will not be dissapointed.","I've had this camera for over a month now and I absolutely love it.  When I was shopping for a camera, the main things that I was looking for were compact size and good picture quality.  What drew me to this camera was the image stabilization.  I have very shaky hands, and this, along with good reviews, sold me on this camera.  The big screen is a plus and so far haven't seen a negative impact on battery power.  The camera was fairly easy to use and I think the menu operation is very intuitive.  It's definitely an eye catcher as well; everyone who sees it asks me about it (I opted for the black - very sexy).  Picture quality has been really good.  Red eye can sometimes be an issue, but editing red eye out of photos is so easy that I'm not concerned.<br /><br />My only gripes so far are that sometimes in dark settings, the pictures can come out very grainy.  Also, every now and then, pictures will come out with a random white spot.  I'm not sure why this happenes, but if anyone has any insight, please share!<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend.","I bought this camera because of all the great features.  It does good in most fronts.  I figured that the optical stabilization would be a nice feature.<br /><br />I'll get the bad out of the way first.  The camera seems to have more noise than the Cannon sd300, and the camera I replaced it with the Cannon sd500. The optical stabilization does not come in as useful as you may think, only in low light, non flash situations, or when you are jittery.  I compared pictures from the same lighting conditions between the sd300 and the fx7 and the sd300 just did better with noise.  Even with th sd300's tendency to have more purple fringing, it was not an issue in my try out.<br /><br />Over the 4 months, I exercised the fx7 a lot, and it did good, but I believe that the sd300 is just a better camera $ for $ and is better executed, and the sd500 is WAY better and has much less noise.<br /><br />The good: it takes good pictures in normal light.  Size is incredible, nice features, generally a nice camera with a feature you won't find in any other cameras in its class, OIS.","I have owned 3 digital cameras now and this is by far the best one that I have seen.  I read a couple reviews on here complaining about grainy pictures but I could not disagree more...I have developed about 50 pictures using this camera and they are all fantastic and very clear.  I would highly recommend this camera...It is so easy to carry around.  I put it in my pocket almost anytime I go out because its so small its like carrying your cell phone in your pocket.  The number of pictures I take has risen dramatically since I bought this tiny camera because it is so easy to carry around and no hassle at all.  Buy it...You'll be pleased.","It took me a while to finally purchase a digital camera - I didn't want to hurt my SLR's feelings. I researched the market extensively before taking the plunge. I was about ready to go for a Casio Exilim until taking a look at this little baby. Its tiny size means that it goes everywhere I go - it's about the size of my cell phone. I have the black model, and it sure has sex appeal. The display is huge and pretty clear. The Leica lens does what it should - crisp, beautiful photos that capture color so nicely. Five megapixels does seem like overkill, but when I looked for a Panasonic Lumix DMC-series with 4 MP, they seemed pretty scarce and the price was nearly as high as for this model. The image stabilization is a handy feature - drives up the price considerably, too, but I really like that my camera has it, since I prefer not to use flash whenever possible, so camera shake is always an issue. It compensates somewhat for camera shake, but for shutter speeds longer than maybe a half second, you'll probably notice some blurriness, regardless of this function. I like the various shooting modes that it offers - I've gotten a lot of use out of the Snow function in particular. I wish it had a function for use in flourescent lighting, but it  does have whiteness adjustment feature so that you can cancel out the greenish tint manually. My hands are pretty tiny, so the size of the buttons doesn't bother me, but I could see that being frustrating for someone with larger hands. Battery life is pretty lousy. This is the biggest complaint I have. I can drain the thing in a day or two if I take a lot of pictures. I'm looking into buying a back-up, but they're expensive - I just wish this one lasted longer. I'm also still trying to figure out how to take pictures of people with flash without their faces turning out white as flour. There's a negligible lag time between pressing the shutter release and the photo being taken, and it can be close to eliminated by pre-focusing (press the shutter release halfway down as you frame the shot). Still, it can't capture images instantaneously - for that, I keep my SLR around.","I'm no professional when it comes to cameras but I know a good gadget when I see one.  The User interface is nicely put together with easily understandable navigation.  This camera is bound to appeal to all user levels. It has a simple point and shoot mode as well as manual mode for the more advanced user.  The photo quality is comparable to most cameras in its class.  My only reservations about the camera are that the battery life is not fantastic but I reckon that is a trade-off for a 2\" LCD.  It would have been nice to have a viewfinder to revert to when running low on battery life.<br /><br />Also, I'd advice you get a carry case for this camera. The LCD screen is not recessed at all and is therefore likely to get scratches when placed with the back down.  One other reservation I have is the time lag between pressing the \"snap\" button and the picture actually being taken.<br /><br />Other than that, its an excellent piece of engineering...","This is a wonderful camera. I bought it for the Leica lens, because I know lens quality is even more important than megapixels. If there had been a camera this sweet with a Leica lens and fewer megapixels, I would have been happy, but having 5 megapixels is just icing on the cake. The number one thrilling feature of this camera is the ability to take good pictures in low light conditions. By low, I don't mean darkness, but I do mean for example at night in a room illuminated by one light. Pictures come out wonderfully and show the true light of the room, in focus, in detail. And that's without a flash. With the flash, you can get great indoor pictures of people. (Flash helps for people a night because people tend to move around, and in low light conditions shutter speeds are slower, leading to blurring if the subject is moving... the image stabilization of this camera can compensate for your hand wiggling a bit, but it can't make the people in your picture hold still, which is why flash is a good idea at night if your picture includes people.)<br /><br />Others have said quite a bit, and I'll skip most things that have already been mentioned. To elaborate on the issue of it having a small battery, one great thing is it does have some very smart power saving options built in to the settings, and these are quite aggressive about saving power if you set them right.<br /><br />Slide show mode is nice for showing off pictures without the bother of pressing buttons.<br /><br />I found the UI of the camera to be excellent. I just wished for a few more geeky advanced settings, but there are quite a few settings already, and they are pretty clear and easy to use, so even a beginner and non-geek should do fine.<br /><br />Made in Japan. Tripod mount. Burst mode. SD card, which means you don't need to install the included software, you can just copy files directly if you have an SD card reader.<br /><br />The fact it comes with a small capacity SD card, not a big one, I put in the plus category because that means I'm not paying a Panasonic price for a large card when I can buy a large card (1GB), and a high speed 60x one at that, for $100 after shopping around.<br /><br />Minor nits: I wouldn't mind having a smaller screen to save battery life. / There is a VERY bright red LED that blasts on with every picture, making it unlikely to ever take any candid shots. / The metal finger-nub protrusion on the front of the camera seems unneccessary, although it is quite nicely done and doesn't protrude much. / The camera did not come with the lens cap and lens hood mentioned in the Amazon overview (not that I care; that might have been a mistake in the overview, because this thing would only accomodate a lens cap or hood when it was turned on; that's the only time the lens sticks out). / The end of my battery cover sticks out a teensy bit (can feel it sticking out, but can't really see it, as it's too minor), as if the final fit wasn't quite right. Anyone else have this, or is mine special? / No audio output, though it does record sound with videos, and can also let you do sound annotations for stills. / Original Panasonic batteries hard to find. / No camera case included. / 1-second splash screen when turning off would be nice to disable. / Rotating an image only rotates it on the camera; when you copy images off the SD card, they revert back to their old unrotated selves. Maybe if I used the supplied software to copy images this wouldn't happen.<br /><br />Wish list, but I always want more: bluetooth. / remote control. / stealth mode features (shoot without flashing LED). Tape over the LED won't work, because this camera uses the light from the LED to aid in autofocus, at least for some shots. / Sound recording. It already records during video; why not have an audio-only record mode. Probably would have added too much to the UI. / Setting to keep screen off all the time to save battery.<br /><br />Even after all my nitpicking, I still say this is a very, very, very nice camera because of the nice pictures it takes and the nice features.","I got this camera as a handy \"put in my pocket and go\" alternative to my Canon 20D (which I love, but isn't always convenient to lug around).<br /><br />I've been very impressed with the camera.  The Leica glass pays off in terms of sharpness and especially color reproduction and contrast.  You'll want to get a second battery with this and bring it on long outings, but the battery is small so it's easy to stick the spare in your pocket.<br /><br />Getting so many megapixels on such a small camera sensor can create noise when the camera goes up to ISO 200 or higher in very low light situations.  It's easy enough to get around by forcing the camera into a slower ISO, and the image stabilization helps hold steady for the needed longer shutter speeds.<br /><br />My only complaints about the camera: I think the menu system could be better designed (very easy mind you, just a few things that require more button pushes then I think should be required), the flip screen animation building mode is pretty useless for most people--a panorama building mode would be much more useful, and it would be nice to be able to review any recorded audio notes when viewing images on the camera.<br /><br />I've been very happy with the camera and recommend it.","This camera is absolutely amazing. I was nervous to spend so much but have been waiting so long to purchase a 5MP camera that is small enough to sneak into the bar for some fun party flicks. This camera is a god sent. The image quality is very nice. And the menu system is very intuitive.<br /><br />The only minus is what the reviews say is battery life (I get a night + a little on a full charge). But having knowing this I got an extra battery for the times when I want to take 100 shots without going home.<br /><br />The LCD is to die for. I do think if it had a dock it would be nice but these small details are minimal when you think of the BANG in this puppy.<br /><br />My suggestion, buy it and dont look back. This is the perfect camera for someone who wants to have fun and good pictures in the dark streets of new york or wherever you may reside.","I have this camera for over a week now, and have tested it out quite well to feel good enough to recommend it.<br /><br />I won't go into details that others have already covered, but what I consider useful.<br /><br />I did spend a lot of time comparing the picture quality of various ultra-compact cameras including Sony DSC-T1, Canon SD300, Pentax Optio S5i, Casio Exilim EX-Z55, and Panasonic DMC-FX7.  These are pictures posted by the professional reviewers at steves-digicams.com, dcresource.com, dpreview.com, and megapixel.net.<br /><br />Based on my personal judgement, the pictures taken by the FX7 are almost-always sharper, and have more details, which is what I consider the most important quality I look for in a camera.<br /><br />The Image Stabilizer feature does help, even though it may not help much in low-lighting condition.<br /><br />The battery life is short, but since I've been getting a minimum of 60 max-resolution shots (all with flash) per full charge.  I consider that good enough for my need.  I do have a spare battery (bought from a guy with id \"imode technology\" on eBay) with me all the time, though.<br /><br />I also use an ultra compact case Tamrac 5686, which fits the camera just fine while still have a small pocket for the spare battery and/or spare SD card.<br /><br />For SD card, I use a Sandisk Ultra II 512MB due to its speed.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm keeping my FX7 as I'm quite happy with its looks, quality, and performance.","I bought this camera to replace my old 3MP Sony. Had it now for about one month. The quality of the images is great for a change. There are multiple auto settings for various situations, ie night portrait, night landscape, sport, and default among others. Very thin and light, yet big enough to hold, a perfect combination. All controls are very intuitive and easy to use. I am really impressed.","Before I bought this camera, I used one of the tiny Casio Exilim cameras.  My biggest complaint about the small digital cameras are that the small size makes it easy to shake and therefore take blurry images.  With the Panasonic DMC-FX7, its still a small camera but with the image stabilization, pictures are very sharp.  Initially, I thought it would bother me that there's no optical viewfinder, but I don't notice it at all now.<br /><br />pros:<br /><br />- huge 2.5\" screen<br /><br />- image stabilization works and takes sharp pictures<br /><br />- small form factor<br /><br />- 5.0 megapixels<br /><br />- uses SD cards (a 1GB card is about $70 or less now)<br /><br />- solid construction (feels solid and metal finish is high quality)<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />- weak flash (which is common to many small digital cameras)<br /><br />- more expensive than other cameras<br /><br />- battery life is OK.  (I'd get an extra battery if you're taking this camera with you on vacation)<br /><br />- no optical viewfinder (but as mentioned, it's not an issue for me)<br /><br />overall I love this camera for the size and the quality of pictures it takes!","I think I spent several months trying to make a decision on which digi to go for, but I finally rested on this wonderful Lumix camera. I can't help but buy on design (which is why I had an instant attraction to the Sony T1), but the Lumix FX7 is not just a pretty package. It has an enormous 2.5'' LCD screen which I love. The camera is so small; exactly the same size as a business card or an iPod mini (a lil thicker, of course).<br /><br />Some of the naysayers are complaining of digital cameras that don't have the optical viewfinder because it helps stabilize an image, but this digi comes with an image stablization system like the big SLRs so you don't have to worry too much about blurry images.<br /><br />If you'd like more info on this camera, go to [...] . Now if only I could find a nice sleeve that could fit the camera snugly.","I bought this camera from Vann's one week ago. The camera is extremely easy to use and every small detail is well thought out. I am most impressed with the optical image stabilization (go to panasonic.com for some cool animations that show how it works). I am consistently able to take pictures indoors without flash at very slow shutter speeds. I have taken smear or blur-free images at 1sec, 1/5sec, etc. shutters. This is amazing for a pocket camera! I had considered buying a larger digital camera with a larger lens to allow more photography without flash, but this Panasonic feature does the trick.<br /><br />Other cool features:<br /><br />*Infinite burst photography (takes consecutive pictures as long as the shutter release is depressed)<br /><br />*12x zoom on replayed pictures makes it easy to determine if a picture was focused correctly. There's even a \"map\" to indicate what zoomed-in portion of the image you are viewing.<br /><br />*Huge 2.5\" screen! Not as high in resolution as the comparable Sony T1, but the other features more than make up the difference<br /><br />*Image stabilization works quite well and allows indoor photography without flash<br /><br />I'm still learning all the pre-programmed scene modes, but overall I'm quite impressed and would highly recommend this camera. FYI-I purchased this camera as a replacement to my Minolta F100.","I bought this camera after much research. It is superior to its Sony counterpart T-1 in almost every way:<br /><br />+It is about 50 g lighter than the T-1, which is quite substantial. It weighs no more than my cell phone when I put it in my pocket.<br /><br />+Image stabilization!<br /><br />+The material the camera is made of is better looking than the dull T-1.<br /><br />+Cheap memory cards, it uses SD cards, not the Sony Memory Sticks, which is 1/2 the price of the Memory Sticks<br /><br />+It's NOT SONY!<br /><br />+LCD screen is bigger than the T-1<br /><br />+Cheaper batteries than the Sony T1<br /><br />One thing I have to warn you though, the movie mode spits out .mov files, which is only compatible with Apple QuickTime. Personally, I much prefer the .avi format other cameras offer, but it's a worthy tradeoff, I never use the video mode anyways.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this camera, I've gotten countless \"oohs and ahhs\" from people, which is more than I can say about the Sony T1, as way too many people have that.","I bought this camera in Japan in August... it's been great so far.

Everything was fine until August, 2009 when the camera began acting funny when I would turn it on.  It had a whited out display like an iris that was open too wide.  This was intermittent and if I turned it off and on a couple times it would usually come on.  Then I took some pictures of my house.  The blue sky came out purple and the white trim came out pink!  Eventually the display became all black with horizontal white static lines upon power-up.<br />To make a long story short, all of these problems were due to faulty vendor-supplied CCD image sensors that Canon had installed in more than 25 of it's Digital Cameras and Camcorders.  Because Canon determined that my camera's problems were due to this faulty part, they repaired it and paid for shipping both ways regardless of warranty status (mine was about 4 years out of warranty at this point).  From my finding the Service Notice online and calling Canon to receiving my camera back repaired took about 3 weeks.  I actually didn't get it fixed until November because I was debating whether to get it repaired (unaware of the faulty parts/free repair) or upgrade to a digital SLR, but decided I couldn't afford the upgrade at the time.  When I contacted Canon and they determined that my camera qualified for the rapair, they offered me some other presumably higher-end cameras, refurbished at additional cost.  When I declined they proceeded with my repair with no further questions.<br />Two weeks ago a friend of mine told me that his $600 plasma TV died suddenly a year and a half after he bought it (six months out of warranty).  When he inquired about repair he was told that that is the typical lifespan of that type of TV and (naturally) it would be more cost effective to replace it than to repair it.  Canon could have chalked this problem up to planned obsolescence, just plain bad luck or customer misuse.  What they did was step up and stand behind their product.  The replacement of all of these components, not to mention the two-way shipping could not have been cheap for Canon to absorb.<br />I also want to mention Canon's customer service.  Customer service in America in 2009 in horrible and has on more than one occassion caused a business to never see any of my hard-earned money again.  I had to call Canon on the phone twice.  Both times I was able to speak to a human.  Both times!  Both of them were polite, informative and understandable.  Canon's customer service could not have been better!  Canon has won themselves at least one loyal customer, and I hope many others feel the same way!<br /><br />As for the Canon A85 itself, this is my first digital.  After clinging to my 35mm Pentax ME Super like a baby to a blankie, I finally broke down and went digital.  At 4 megapixels the picture quality is good as long as you don't try to go too enlargement-crazy.  Auto mode is pretty idiot-proof and works fine for most situations .  There are several special modes including Night Scene, Fast Shutter, Slow Shutter, Stitch Assist (for combining multiple shots into a panorama), Indoor, Fireworks and more.  I haven't even tried most of these because Auto mode is so all-purpose.  Manual mode is just what it sounds like allowing you to customize all settings.  There is even a Movie mode which shoots video and sound.  The video looks good but is limited to the size of the memory card and it goes fast in this mode. The microphone picks up whatever is closest to it, including moving your hands around on the camera.  But hey it's a digital camera, not a camcorder, so this mode is kind of a bonus anyway!  Available separately are Wide, Tele and Close-up lenses to add to the A85's versatility.  All in all I've been very happy with this camera, it's functionality and picture quality.","Great camera, great pictures still using it after 3 years, takes better pictures than some of the newer cameras.","I bought the Powershot A85 almost 3 years ago to replace my A70. My A70 had lasted around 3 years until some shutter door type thing inside the camera broke and all went black.  I was told it was fixable but after 3 years I was kind of excited to upgrade.<br /><br />The A85 has been wonderful for the last 2.5 years. I am just starting to see some wear and tear in the last couple of months. Picture quality is starting to fail (pictures coming out grainy or dark) but it's off and on.  Some pics still come out great. Shutter lag is also getting slower. It probably just needs a good cleaning, but once again I'm getting itchy to upgrade. I should also say, the camera has gotten heavy use and abuse, as I take tons of pictures and have not been as careful with the camera as I probably should have.<br /><br />It is easy to use, and I am by no means a camera expert. I do take tons of pictures, mostly of the kids, vacations, sporting events.... I like that this camera has alowed me to experiment a little with different settings (portrait, fireworks, etc) without getting too over my head. I have been happy with the zoom quality as well. I usually keep it on the \"fast action\" setting because it does the best job at keeping up with my very active child.<br /><br />My next camera will be the Powershot S5 IS.  I always stick with Canon.  Have owned nothing but Canon cameras and printers since I got my first 35mm back in the early 80s. Overall, I definitely recommend the A85 as an easy to use camera for beginner level photography.","Love this camera. It is my first digital camera and my first point and shoot.<br /><br />The picture quality is great. Although you can now buy P&S cameras with better picture quality I'm still amazed at how good my pictures look, especially compared with the old SLR film camera that I used for years.<br /><br />After three years of using auto mode I'm now learning about aperture and film speed and shutter speed - all of which can be controlled using Av, Tv and other such settings. I'm also starting to get very creative with the kinds of shots I take. This camera seems to be the perfect little tool for my small photo projects and combined with a bit of Photoshop I'm beginning to create some very nice arty photographs.<br /><br />Highly recommended.","I recieved this digital camera for Christmas back in 2004, and it so far been doing very well. The images I want come up nice a clearly (as long as my arms hold steady), and if an image does come out the way I want it to, I can use other options to retake the image (when doing still images). I do plan to one day upgrade to a newer digital camera for art purposes, but for a point and shoot it has done w good job. I have even dropped it a couple times when it was off, and the only problem that came from that is the screen slightly flickers lines through it, but when the image is taken the lines don't appear.","I got this camara a few years ago and have been taking pictures with it ever since.  They are high quality picture.  The controls are easy to use.  You will need to purchase rechargeable batteries to go with it though.  I have had no problems with this camara.  I only wish It had morte megapixels now.","I've had this camera since 2004. Then recently a coworker got a Canon A460 and that got me to thinking that I wanted something new so I checked out some of the newer cameras like the Canon A550 and SD800. Eventually, I will buy the Canon 550 or 570 and give the A85 to my son regardless what's the hurry. Then I was looking at the A85 because I want to buy one for my mom for a overseas trip and saw the reviews on amazon so I thought I would share mine. This is a great little camera. I have taken excellent pictures with it. And I have had no problems with it. It is easy to use and I do have 2 sets of rechargable batteries.","I have been using the A85 for about 9 months and have found it to be extemely easy to operate, takes wonderful pictures, and can fit in your pocket.  I use rechargeable batterys which give me at least 250 shots between charges. I download right from the camera onto my laptop and make any adjustments using a photo shop tool.  Aside for some red eye from the flash shots the pictures are perfect up to an 8x10.  I am just shy of 2,000 pictures and 0 problems.  I have ordered a new Canon Rebel XT as I have lenses from other Canon equipment and would like to go digital in an SLR.  My little A85 will never be left behind. I have friends who have other digital cameras which have a higher megapixel than the A85 and the images are not as clear.  You get good and bad in everything and believe me I got a great one in my A85.  If something would happen to it then I would buy another one without reservation.","I've owned this camera for about 1 1/2 years. It worked great until 2 days ago. It fell off the top of my desk top computer (I was uploading pictures) about 16\" off the carpet. After that it would not recognize the memory card. Tech said about $100 to fix.<br /><br /> There's no way a little bump like that should break a camera.","$600 dollars I spent in my first Sony SD40 camera long time ago. 3 years later I was still not able to take my desired pictures and still reading the manual to learn it's features.<br /><br />With the Canon A85 I can take not only regular pictures but also, close-up using the macro feature, short movies and make my own posters.<br /><br />For someone who is not a professional photo taker nor a photoshop pro user, this A85 is the perfect, affordable, friendly user and light weighted camera to own.<br /><br />My 2 cents.","I know some people have expressed dissatisfaction with the 'grainy' quality of the images.  I guess it depends on what you are trying to do with it.  I did some research, and this camera was recommended to me for what I like to do, which is take pictures of old buildings and sculpture.  As it turned out, this camera was wonderful for that, because the pictures are very evocative.  I took it on vacation and I liked the result of my nature pics, too.  The photos have a 'softer' look that is a bit different from the usual 'hard' digital photo look, and it suits me.  Of course if you are not looking for that, you might want to try something else.  This might be a good camera for the more creative types.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because this was only my first digital camera and don't have much experience with the others, but it is my cherished friend now because of the lovely photos it's given me.","We have owned this Canon camera for about 7 months now and we love it!!!  The pictures come out great!  We have not had one problem with it.  We recently went away to a B&B and I took pictures of the B&B at night and they came out perfect!!!  I wish it zoomed in closer, but all in all I love this camera!!","I bought the A85 last fall and, like several other Amazon reviewers, was disappointed by blurry photos. The odd thing was that indoor and/or closeup shots turned out OK, but outdoor/landscape shots would be out of focus.<br /><br />A professional photographer I work with said, \"Looks like the camera is having trouble focusing to infinity. Take it back.\" The Canon service center in Honolulu replaced the lens assembly at no charge (the camera is still under warranty) and now my photos are crisp and detailed.<br /><br />The range of settings and controls on the A85 is great. You can shoot full Auto, or get more control with Program mode (my favorite) or use Aperture, Shutter or full manual modes. I get very good photos of my son's indoor band concerts (dark hall, flash off, tripod, long exposure), something that would have been impossible with my previous 2-megapixel digicam that had almost no manual controls.<br /><br />I give this 4.5 stars, based on the fact I got a factory dud and that I had a twinge of buyer's remorse when, a few months after I bought this camera, Canon rolled out its A510/A520 series, which is a smaller, lighter camera with 4x optical zoom and uses only 2 AA batteries.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a very good camera, but the A510/A520 series might be a better deal (see reviews on dcresource.com or megapixel.net).","This is the second digital camera I have ever toyed with.  The first one was a 3 megapixel camera that was junk in every way.  The PowerShot is 4 megapixels.  Does that mean it's better?  With what Canon shoved into this tiny thing, I'd say a big yes.  But to me, the resulting photo is more important than any bells and whistles.<br /><br />Actually, I've been doing a tiny bit of research on this \"megapixel\" stuff, and I've had a few chats with the Senior Vice-President of IMAX Corporation (who else would understand resolution than the owner of a quality control business for large-format films?).  Check this out.  Simply put, a megapixel (defined as a resolution of a million pixels or greater) is actually a marketing scam.  A 4 megapixel camera can be marketed as such (they refer to the CCD chip), while the actual image is taken with less than half that.  In this case,  the CCD chip works UP TO 2272 x 1704 pixels (3.8 megapixels); plus the final image is compressed.  In the end, your beautiful photo isn't as beautiful as it could be.  And even if it looks good, the company is lying through its smiles.<br /><br />And advertisements press the megapixel and digital zoom issues while ignoring the relevant (at least AS IMPORTANT) issues: contrast, brightness, focus, etc.<br /><br />Here are my opinions about some of the PowerShot A85 features.<br /><br />Let me get a few quick things out of the way.  The zoom (5.4mm - 16.2mm) is atrocious.  Compared to a similar priced camera, the A85 cannot zoom, period, and the digital is pixellated and looks like someone did the mosaic effect on your photo.<br /><br />The flash is super bright, but there is no automatic shutter compensation, so your subject comes out looking white-hot (great for some effects shots).  I work around this, since most auto-cameras compensate for the flash resulting in extremely dark backgrounds.<br /><br />The delay between pressing the shutter is annoying.  It's not a large delay, but I've missed some good portrait shots because of this.  (But I can take dozens of pictures for \"free\" as opposed to my film camera, which I now reserve for nature shots only.)  There is a feature to photograph 8 pictures in a series within 1.5 seconds which would fix my problem.  I'm just lazy about this one, though.<br /><br />I have taken images with the camera in non-professional settings, and they come out looking pretty good!  I've used some of these images on DVDs and watched them on TV and they look impressive on the screen.  The colors of the original subject remain the same even on a television (blue-light).  Keep in mind there is a difference between images on paper, and images meant to be seen on a monitor or screen.  Somewhat of an amateur photographer myself, I would never resort to digital photographs just yet for a show, but I do use the PowerShot for website and DVD/TV applications, as well as pamphlets.  (I find that, depending on the subject, a digital picture looks as good as a photo scanned into a computer, and saves me money and time in the process.)<br /><br />The autofocus features are incredibly high-tech.  This camera was purchased for its purportedly amazing macro feature, though, and this is sadly overrated.  The macro is impossible to use and never works.  Recently, I took a hike up a Colorado mountain into Alpine Tundra terrain and along the way I found a small group of Alpine Forget-me-not flowers.  I am able to get serious macro photos with my 35mm and extension tube, while the PowerShot required some serious distance.  The photos came out blurry (I took them anyway) even with different focal lengths and camera distances.  I made sure the Macro Flower was on the screen.<br /><br />Speaking of the screen, I have found it to still be pretty easy to see, even in sunlight.  It's not so pixellated that I can't focus (meaning that it looks great) and it shows the exact photo area.  I use it all the time, and I never use the little viewfinder, which is tiny in size, doesn't quite match the zoom frame of the digital screen, and has a horrible parallax problem (although I am used to shooting SLR cameras).  There are no parallax correction guidance lines in the viewfinder, either; those never work anyway.<br /><br />The auto shutter speed isn't great for shots of people moving or nature in which the wind is blowing or the subject is running away for its life from the photographer.  However, I have some great pix of people talking and they're slightly blurry, and the effect came out as a wonderful surprise.  I still use it today.  Don't let this bother you, though.  You can choose from 15 seconds to 1/2000 of a sec, though I never use this feature.<br /><br />You can take movies up to three minutes (low res), or 30 seconds high res (640 x 480), the latter which looks nearly like true video when watched on TV.  I spliced it up against Hi-8 footage (which I personally think looks better/sharper than single-chip miniDV), and the difference was negligible on a Sony TV.  Sound is also recorded and played back.<br /><br />You can take panorama pictures for however many photos you want (I made a 720-degree upward-spiraling panorama to awesome effect).<br /><br />You can set the White Balance to auto, day light, cloudy, tungsten, two fluorescent choices, and custom: just aim at a colored object and press the set key.  For example:<br />¤ Red wood gives a Matrix-like green result<br />¤ A lemon results in a power-blue color<br />¤ A green digital clock bathes your photos in darkroom red (you lose focus a bit)<br />¤ \"White\" computer screen (actually blue-ish) results in a nice orange filter<br />¤ A dark blue portfolio will give you a great yellow (nice for surreal outdoor shots)<br />Messing with the white balance works best if you set it with a colored light, rather than a colored object.  You can also use these color features to play with contrast; then in a photo program, turn the image into black & white, and voila, a pseudo-Ansel Adams!<br /><br />A silly thing, but you can change the start-up image (like on your cellphone) with a choice between Canon bluescreen, Morning Star, and Bird, along with theme sound effects (you can change these independently  as well).<br /><br />There are too many other little features that I never use.  This camera would be, quite literally, perfect for my tastes if it weren't for a poor optical zoom, poor digital zoom, and macro.  I'm a huge macro/telephoto fan, so I had to remove one star for these.  Otherwise, it's quite simply amazing, the technology that's out there.  I hate to think what a higher-priced Canon can do.<br /><br />Check out \"customer images\" to see what people (myself included) have done with this camera!","I got this camera for Christmas from my parents. I think it's really good for its price. The quality of the pictures are really good, and the zoom is decent. I go to a lot of rock shows, and it can get really hard to take pictures when you're in the mosh pit, but this camera is really good. And, somehow, I can stuff the camera in my pocket when I'm not using it, even though it is really bulky. And I love taking videos as well.","This was the best present my husband could have got me.  Love the pictures from my camera.  The prints are awesome.  I scrapbook and love the way the colors come out on my pages.  The camera is medium ease to use so if you are an absulute beginner get someone who knows some about camera's to show you how to use it.  My husband got some bad pictures because of user error, but after I showed him how to use it he was really pleased.  I will continue to buy Canon I owned a Kodak before this no comparison on picture quality.","My purchasing decision for the Canon Powershot A85 was most unusual. As a defense contractor (and 'part time' professional photog) and the owner of a Canon Digital Rebel - there are places and circumstances a large digital camera will cause unwanted and undue attention to be paid to one's self. My solution was a compact backup camera - originally a Canon A75 - purchased for its price and ability to share compact flash memory cards with the Digital Rebel and AA Ni-Mh rechargable batteries with my Canon 420EX speedlight. Things got more complicated when I purchased a Canon underwater housing (WP-DC30 - see my review) specifically designed for the A75 while scuba diving in Aruba. Both the A75 and A85 are limited underwater performers - built in flash limits the depth acceptable pictures can be taken. Anything more than 25' - plan to spend time in photoshop!<br /><br />While the A75 is a \"good enough\" camera at 3.2 MP, I was looking to upgrade to a better backup camera - still at a price point - and distrustful of any underwater housing - a replacement backup camera. Amazon had a great price on the A85 - and the underwater housing for the A75 is an exact match for the A85. Enough said.<br /><br />The A85 is lighter and has faster shutter response than the A75. The \"feel\" of this compact camera is \"right\" for my (large) hands. It takes astoundingly beautiful daylight pictures. Its 3x optical zoom is \"good enough\" for a majority of my picture taking - the 4 MP resolution allows additional enlargement and magnification with little loss of quality in Photoshop. Since many of my photo's are e-mailed to my family to prove I'm still alive when on assignment - large picture quality is less important - as most pictures are reduced in size for computer/internet transmission.<br /><br />Auto focus and auto exposure in low light is still slower than I want it to be. Faster than the A75 - but still has an annoying delay setting up flash and auto exposure in low light.<br /><br />As with the A75, the movie mode is limited. No ability to zoom - and quality is only 'acceptable' in this mode. Like to take movies?... - buy a camcorder!<br /><br />Red-eye is still a problem carried over from the A75. The flash/lens positioning allows only a narrow angle of red-eye free picture taking.<br /><br />You are going to have to purchase 2300ah NiMh rechargable batteries - or even two sets. I share 5 sets and three chargers (might be overkill for some) with my Canon 420EX and 580EX speedlights (used with the Digital Rebel), the A75 and A85 cameras. High heat or extreme cold are battery power sappers. Never want to miss a picture opportunity. I also share a variety of 512MB to 1 GB compact flash high speed memory cards with the Digital Rebel.<br /><br />The A75's plastic case easily scratches around the lens ring. I expect this with the A85 also. Buy a carry pouch that holds the camera firmly - and still has carrying capacity for a spare set of AA batteries. Dirt and dust have not been a problem - yet - although the camera case and lens mechanism need to be either vacuumed or airblown to keep sand and grit from interfering with the zoom mechanism. Sand and grit get into everything in many places I go.<br /><br />Under most circumstances - the A85 performs brilliantly. Under water (limited by its' flash) - or above - anywhere a full sized camera presents a problem - the A85 gets the job done.","I got this camera for myself. I am a big fan of 35mm film but I must say that this does come close in quality for picture type. One reviewer has mentioned that his pictures were grainy. the manual says if this happens it is likely that the camera has been malfunctioning dur to dropping, or extreme temperatures. it has a lot of nifty buttons to impress anyone, and the best part is that it makes movie clips with sound. It comes with softwars to transfer photos and clips.<br /><br />You can make a home movie when you add all the movie clips together with special effects and sound using the software that comes with the camera.<br /><br />*****recommend getting at least a 128mb compact flash card 32 mb is not much. AND get rechargebale batteries with at least 2100mAh and charger to help avoid those unecessary battery drainage problems","If you want to take good pictures leave it on Auto all the time no matter what the condition. If you want to take stellar pictures you will need to Read and study all the aspects and settings and learn when to use them for what kind of photo it is. This camera has a setting for every environment. When you figure it out your pictures will be Professional quality.<br /><br />Final thoughts- Realize you can spend 500.00 on a camera with 7 mega-pixels and not know how to use it. If I use the features properly of this camera I will match you quality for quality.<br /><br />Practice every feature in many lightings, you will be amazed at how 1 setting affects the entire picture!<br /><br />PROS- Image quality is excellent, Grip of the camera, Battery Life excellent, Low-Light conditions are great if you know how to work the settings. For what you get the price is perfect!I see no reason to get anything better than this unless I am a professional photographer. FOr Home, Family Trips, sporting events, etc.. It's excellent","Personally, I own the A80, and I like it so much that I got the A85 for my father-in-law.  He is an avid picture-taker and loves the ease of the Canon.  There are many picture taking options with this camera, and even a rookie can take good, quality pictures.  I remember some advice I got when I got my first camera--stick to the companies who make cameras their business.  You won't be disappointed with Canon.","Absolutely amazing camera.<br /><br />First a little backhistory.  I owned Canon products for the most of my life.  My first digital camera was an HP however.<br /><br />After my HP broke about 2 years after purchase (hardware failure, nonspecific, 150 bucks to fix at HP) i went with this camera.  The difference is amazing.<br /><br />Canon products have always been a favorite choice of mine due to ease of use.  Its settings dial makes it fast and simple to change from mode to mode for various uses.<br /><br />Say for example your filming your son at the soccer field.  you want a nice portrait of him with the field faded in the background.  use the portrait mode.  Then you can use the same camera to get a fast shutter shot of him playing on the field simply by turning the dial.<br /><br />you can even shoot a 3 minute movie of him playing on the field using the same camera!  All it takes is the turn of the dial.<br /><br />In addition to the different settings modes, there are 'creative' modes that you can enjoy by changing the shutter speed and the amount of light the lens lets through (arpeture? value)<br /><br />this can be used to create some amazing effects of sparkling and flowing streams and waterfalls, or of glowing fountains or fireworks... or even \"Light trail\" photos.<br /><br />The creative zones are great when you've got plenty of time to play around, and the preset modes are top notch.<br /><br />Its hard to take a bad picture with this camera.<br /><br />The \"auto\" mode is so powerful that you can literally open the box and start taking photos immediately.  After a quick read through the manual you'll know how to take photos like a pro, and with just a little bit of learning and experimenting you'll be taking some real artsy shots too ;)<br /><br />The battery life is amazing, especially with the optional canon NIMH batteries.  The batters that came with it are not rechargable, but i was able to shoot over 100 shots + film 5 or 6 highest resolution movies (30 seconds a shot) before the batteries were dead.  My NIMH batteries fully charged have taken over 100 shots and are still hot.<br /><br />Now, about memory.  Flash memory is some of the least expensive and better quality memory for digital cameras.  The fact that they've gone with flash memory cards here is ideal.  It ships with a 32 meg memory card (retail of about ten dollars as of this writing) and getting 256 meg and up is generally under 50 dollars.<br /><br />Finally we talk about printing features.  The canon camera has easy printing and easy sharing with any canon printer with a camera dock.  This is largely most Canon printers.  You absolutely will love any canon printer you buy, i believe them to be the best printers you can purchase.  Canon has entry level printers for well under 100 bucks, some under 50 bucks in some cases (as of this writing, the IP1500 sits on my desktop) and they're the best in their price range, across all price ranges.<br /><br />I honestly think it would be difficult to make a mistake purchasing this camera.<br /><br />My only suggestion is to consider the Canon a95 camera, which is 1 megapixel higher, and has a swivel LCD screen.  I had no use for the swivel screen and the larger picture depth wasnt worth the extra cash at the time of my purchase, but its something to consider if you're reading this review.","have given the A85 4 stars although I would have given it 4.5 stars if possible and A80 5 stars. There are 2 basic reasons why I like A80 more than A85, but you may decide otherwise:<br /><br />1)Bigger CCD Sensor - 1/1.8\" on A80 vs. 1/2.7\" on A85 - which means 5 million pixels compared to 4 million leading to better image quality.<br /><br />2)Flip out LCD screen (1.5\" on A80 vs 1.8\" fixed LCD on A85)- The flip out screen is very useful when taking certain shots. I typically used the flip out screen most when taking<br /><br />-shots of crowds down the center and of tall buildings by holding the camera above my head,<br /><br />-in tight spot situations on hikes/treks where I could not shift much by twisting the screen sideways,<br /><br />-of children/smaller objects on the ground without having to kneel on a sidewalk etc.","After many days of resource and asking many professional opinions I heard that this was the best 4 megapixel camera that fit all my needs: excellent picture quality, compact and had manual controls.<br /><br />However, when I finally got the camera I took it everywhere with me to test out the photos, and 50% of the time they were out of focus, or the camera had focused on the wrong thing. I used both types of focus available to no difference. The photos that were in focus were very nice, but not worth the price and the chance of only half of them turning out properly. Also, the camera speed is slightly slower than what I wanted, it had trouble catching a cable car in San Francisco as it drove down the street!<br /><br />I've returned that camera and have replaced it with a Minolta, my favorite brand though i'd been hesitant because it had fewer manual controls, however, I prefer it much more!<br /><br />I loved the controls of the A85 though, very convenient and easy to use and the lcd screen was quite large. It's just too bad the pictures weren't of the caliber I was expecting.","Got this as a Christmas present from my folks - wonderful!  Just put the batteries that come with the camera in - set the date by following the easy prompts and you're shooting pictures within 2 minutes of taking out of box.  I have used only the auto setting, and it's great!  Downloaded to my Dell 4600 computer  very quick and simple!! It uses the same transfer cord as my MP3 player and my Dad's Olympus camera so I only need one cord to download 3 different things!  So far, I'm very impressed!  It is bigger with the 4 batteries, but also provides a much nicer, easier grip - good for husbands like mine with bigger hands.<br /><br />The only things I don't like are only a small 128MB card is included and I'll defintely have to buy a bigger card.  Second, there is more of a delay than I'd like before flash recharges and you can take another picture, but i think that's a factor of price - this camera really delivers for the price - a faster shutter speed costs more and i don't really need that anyway!  It's not much slower than my olk Nikon 35 MM camera.  For amateurs like me who just want nice family photos, you can't go wrong with this camera!  I'll update my review if there's problems later, but I don't think there will be.","Point and shoot, very easy to use digital camera.<br /><br />The picture quality was great too!","This camera is awesome.  I tried several Kodak cameras first -CX7430, DX7440, CX7300 before settling in on this jewel.  I really wanted in a big way to use the easyshare stuff for printing and ease of use.  I tried to make the Kodaks work but the Kodaks seem to have underpowered flashes.  I got lots of blurry and dim shots with the kodaks.  The A85 has a dynamic flash and an auto focusing lamp to help focus in dim light. I had much better results with this canon.  I highly recommend it.  I am even using the picbridge capablity of the A85 connected to a kodak EasyShare printer dock plus -- Awesome results.  There is no question that this camera focuses extremely well.  Colors are very representative.  The biggest negative to the camera is the cheesy plastic cover over the compact flash (the design for this is horrible).  But the power of the camera smooths this negative over very quickly.  I get an occasional fuzzy shot once in a blue moon (unlike the kodaks I tried - every third shot in the lighting of my home).  I would have loved it if cannon would upgrade to USB 2.0 for faster transfer, but the kodaks I tried were USB 1.1 as well.  If you are looking for a great point and shoot with room to grow (including manual focus), look no further.  This camera rocks.  Be sure to buy a rayovac 15 min charger and their NMH batteries (they will save you tons of money).","I bought the Canon A85 as an upgrade to my 5-year-old Canon S10.  I liked the slightly smaller size, doubling the pixels, and greater optical zoom.  I wanted to take advantage of improvements made over the last 5 years.  Immediately impressed with ergonomics -- grip, buttons and playback zoom are excellent.  The camera just feels great, and the price is unbelievably low.  However, in doing picture comparisons with my S10, I'm saddened that the picture quality of the A85 is not as good as the old S10.  Even with double the pixels, many details are not as crisp and colors are not as accurate -- more oranges and pinks.  I am a point-and-shoot picture-taker, and yet I want the pictures as clear and accurate as possible.  I liked this camera better before I did the side-by-side picture comparison with the old S10.  I still think the A85 is an excellent, affordable camera -- but I may be putting it under the Christmas tree for someone else.","Not an experienced photographer, and first digital camera, but took on a vacation and loved the resulting pictures. Especially loved the flower setting for closeups and the scenic setting for stitching a bunch of pictures together for a panoramic view. Easy, easy, easy! And beautiful! Only feature I had trouble with was the fireworks feature, I could never stay still enough for the longer exposure, so ended up with fuzzy night time pics. Probably a photographer fault and not the camera! A 256mb card with the camera set at 1024 x 768 allows for 700 pictures, The 400 I took came out beautiful in 4 x 6 prints.","THE GOOD: Excellent images, fast 9-point autofocus, full manual/shutter priority/aperture priority modes. Scene modes are very effective. Very strong flash unit with fast recycle time. Menu system is easy to navigate. Fast startup/next-shot delay. Excellent battery life on 2300mAh NiMH cells.<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD: It's kinda big, because it uses 4 AA cells. Battery life is worse on alkalines , but still acceptable. Camera-computer transfer is slow due to USB 1.1. Movie files can get big if shot at 640*480 (500Kbytes/sec)<br /><br />---<br /><br />A 256MB card will store 124 highest resolution/lowest compression images, or 375 seconds of highest resolution video.","I love this camera.  I has so many wonderful features... the flip out screen (used to protect the screen, shoot from odd angels, take pictures of yourself that you can line up), the option to hold the picture you just took to share (you know everyone wants to see the picture after it's taken and it takes just too long on normal digital cameras to load the picture).<br /><br />A great buy!!!","I think this is a great camera for the price.  My picture are beautiful though there is some red eye. It is very easy to use and very compact and light.<br /><br />Unfortunately, mine is broken already due to someone putting the memory card in upside down.  So I upgraded to the A95!","I have given the A85 4 stars although I would have given it 4.5 stars if possible and A80 5 stars. There are 2 basic reasons why I like A80 more than A85, but you may decide otherwise:<br /><br />1)Bigger CCD Sensor - 1/1.8\" on A80 vs. 1/2.7\" on A85 - which means 5 million pixels compared to 4 million leading to better image quality.<br /><br />2)Flip out LCD screen (1.5\" on A80 vs 1.8\" fixed LCD on A85)- The flip out screen is very useful when taking certain shots. I typically used the flip out screen most when taking<br />-shots of crowds down the center and of tall buildings by holding the camera above my head,<br />-in tight spot situations on hikes/treks where I could not shift much by twisting the screen sideways,<br />-of children/smaller objects on the ground without having to kneel on a sidewalk etc.<br /><br />And NOW the A80 is cheaper too at Officedepot.com. At Amazon it is selling for much higher than the price of A85 which alone proves its popularity.<br /><br />What A85 offers over A80:<br /><br />1) SCN modes (beach, fireworks etc.)which may not be useful for people who like using more mnual controls as they have many presets for ISO etc. which may not give the best shot. The A80 offered an extra customizable setting in place of the SCN modes which can be useful too.<br /><br />2) A85 also offers 3 resolution settings for video including 640X480 (VGA max 30 sec)while in the A80 the highest setting is 320X240 (max. 3 mins). However, the 30 sec video seems a bit short to me. I usually use this feature to capture special moments of children when my video camera is not handy.<br /><br />3) Print share button: The A85 has a print share button which enables direct printing of images /downloads for marked images. This feature is not very useful for most people especially if you have Windows XP which enables slection/rotation of images and direct download as soon as the USB cable is connected to your computer even without using any Canon software.<br /><br />What all AXX series cameras offer which makes this series Canon's most successful consumer series - so you won't go wrong buying any camera in the series:<br />--Complete Manual functions available - shutter priority, Aperture priority, White balancing, Manual focusing etc.<br />--Photostitch - For stitching together panoramic views. I have shot countless seascapes, 'bridge'scapes, landscapes etc using this function. It is really easy too!<br />-- Tone settings (Tungsten, Sunlight, Cloudy etc.),<br />--Special effects (B/W, Sepia, Vivid, Nuetral etc.) I have used sepia a lot when taking potraits giving them an 'old world' feel. Vivid has been helpful in special situations like a red kite against a blue sky to bring out the colors.<br />--Free Canon software, which works well and allows you to edit images, stitch images, make fun photos, maintain an album, change camera settings, edit videos, upload images back to camera to transfer to another computer etc.<br />--Use AA batteries which are available anywhere in the world. A Sony Super Quick Charger (5hours) with 4 rechargeable NiMH batteries is available for under $23 on Amazon! Charge these batteries upto 1000 times. I keep the LCD on for all my shots and usually I get 270-360 shots from each charge from the A80 including the battery power used to download these images to my computer with the USB cable and playing back these images for friends! That is quite a feat by Canon.<br />--Macro mode - Great for close ups of children or product shots<br />--Many other useful features in the latest models (including A80)like being able to edit the movies in the camera, being able to see multiple images on the LCD, auto rotation of images, ability to add voice notes to pictures, evaluative graphs on the LCD, and much much more. After thousands of shots I still keep discovering new features I haven't used or better ways to use existing features.<br /><br />If you are considering the A95, it is a great camera and a upgraded version of A80, however at a hundred bucks less than the A95 (amazon price) the A80 (Officedepot price) is a great camera with almost the same features except a few differences.<br />-A95 offers 5 MP, and the extra MP may not be useful for you if you don't want to go over 8X10 prints<br />-a slightly larger flip out LCD screen which is great but it will also use up the battery faster<br />-SCN modes (see above)<br />-Print share button (see above)and<br />-Flexizone (you can set the focus in any one of 9 zones) which is a nice feature if you like being creative with your compositions.<br />Overall you have to decide whether you want to pay a hundred bucks more for these differences or any one feature may be the deal breaker for you.<br /><br />In a nutshell, if you are thinking of buying the A85 consider the A80 too!","This is my first digital camera having used film cameras for a very long time and I must say that I have no buyer's remorse over my purchase of the Canon Powershot A85. I agonized over a month comparing this camera to many others like the Powershot A80 and the A95 but it finally came down to pricing and what I needed the camera to do, which made the A85 more than enough camera for me. I didn't need a 5 MP camera to start out with and so I figured this was a good starter. It's a solid camera that produces great pictures and videos. The camera is well balanced for someone like me who wants to experiment with camera settings and someone like my wife who wants a simple point and shoot. 2 sets of rechargeable Nimh batteries are a must. I've had a little bit of  difficulty shooting pictures of people at night without getting a lot of red eye. Fortunately I think this is something that will require more practice to perfect. If not the software, ZoomBrowser EX, that comes with the camera totally corrects the red eye for me. It is an easy camera to use and navigate. Over the past month I've tried to take a variety of pictures ranging from portrait shots to landscapes and I have been very pleased with the pictures. Once again I highly recommend this camera for someone who is just starting out and wants a reasonably priced quality digital camera.","I got the Canon A85 a few weeks back. I was clicking away within 10 min of opening the package. The camera is extremely user friendly, is very intuitive, and has the right dimension and weight for a solid comfortable feel.<br /><br />It also has enough advanced features to keep one curious about it.","I have been using the powershot for a while now and I really enjoy it. Very user friendly and shoots the highest quality photos.<br /><br />Delroy Meadows<br /><br />Nassau, Bahamas<br /><br />[...]","Eh, I don't really agree with the review saying that the zoom is very breakable.  Yes there are quite a few items that will come up if you do a search on google, but considering how many millions of cameras are out there, the percentages are pretty low.  I have a  Canon A-series digital camera from last year that I took everywhere with me.  I just  threw the thing in my pocket without a cover or anything, and it never gave me any problems.  I recently took this new one out to sea on a boat where it was very windy and nothing happened to it.  I also read a  comment in a review that battery life is so-so.  Well, you have to realize that batteries come in all flavors, from cheap alkalines to NiMH and lithiums.  The kind of battery used by the review was not specified.  I recommend using rechargeable NiMH batteries at 2100 mAH and up.  That'll be way more than enough to fill up a 256 mb card.  Well, with that said, I'm going to rate this product based on performace instead of bad luck, and in terms of what it can do, it is really very good, even compared to cameras in a higher class.  Picture quality is very good and there are more manual controls than any other camera in this price range.  This really is the most bang you can get for your buck.  It gives great results and is easy even for the beginner to use.  I really do like Canon products, even at the \"budget\" level the A400 blows away the competition, and you really do get more than you pay for.  I'm not saying that I'll only buy Canon stuff, but you gotta admit that they are pretty good.  Oh by the way, if you're looking for a sealed up camera, the Olympus Stylus 310/410 has waterproof seals, but is locked in fully automatic mode.  If you don't like the way your pictures are coming out, too bad.  Some of the 4 meg Kodaks offer pretty good competition, with a nice amount of manual features and 4x zoom, but the trade-off is that you get a noticeable decrease in picture quality compared to the Canons, especially with shots taken at night.","The A75 and A85 are Excellent follow-ups of the A70, and offer some very nice improvements.  The most noticeable is the larger LCD, scene modes for those who don't like to tinker with the settings, \"C\" dial position to save your custom settings, and the print/share button to make things easier.  For those who don't know, scene modes are easy-to-access presets of a combination of manual adjustments, optimized for shooting in different situations such as when you are indoors, at the beach, taking shots of kids, shooting at night, or shooting fireworks, etc. The camera features full manual controls over shutter speed and aperture, manual focus, saturation, exposure compensation, custom white balance, ISO, metering, and a histogram in playback mode.  I know most people think they won't ever use some of these, but when you have an important shot that just isn't coming out, you'll be really glad you have it (or wish you did).  For those who don't know, control over shutter speed means you can use a fast shutter speed to capture fast action or you can use a slow shutter to avoid using a flash or for taking shots of night scenery.<br /><br />The areas where the Canon A75, A85, and A95 really excel at are:<br /><br />Being fairly small(small price tag too!) for a camera with this many features and having picture quality this good.<br /><br />Creative shooting:  this is a great camera for those who want to do creative shooting but can't afford to plop down $600+ for a Canon G6 or more for a Digital SLR.  It's got all of the most important controls, and with your memory card, you can do all the creative shooting and experimenting you want virtually free compared to using film.  It's even expandable with telephoto, wide angle, or close up conversion lenses and there's also the waterproof casing.<br /><br />All Canon cameras also come with an excellent software package that lets you stitch panoramic photos, retouch photos or rescue those that came out wrong, add special effect, and view thumbnails of pictures so you don't have to open them up to see what the picture looks like (good for those who are using an older version of windows, I know there are still a lot of you out there).  The best part is that it's free!  It does more than Kodak's software(which is pretty decent), you have to pay $20 to get the better version of Olympus's software, and Sony's editing software is pretty much non-existent.  Those who already have Photoshop won't be excited.<br /><br />For those of you who are concerned that the camera doesn't come with rechargeable batteries, don't worry, it's really not a big deal.  Good rechargeable AA's, type NiMH are super cheap at around $10-$15 for 4, compared to $50 for Lithium Ion battery packs, and at that price, everyone can afford a spare set, which is really important to have.  I've seen people who bought much crappier cameras at the same price, just because they came with rechargeable batteries - not a smart choice in my opinion.<br /><br />Yes, there is the problem with purple fringing, but it's not a very common problem and most people either don't know what it is or don't even know think it's much of a problem when they see it.  Some people think it looks cool.  With full control over aperture, you have the ability to get rid of it or at least reduce it.  Compared to the problems that other manufacturers have with their cameras, I'd take a bit of purple fringing over noise, soft/fuzzy images, and over-sharpening any day!<br /><br />If you want 5 megapixels of resolution, a very useful rotating LCD screen, and Flexi-Zone (lets you choose an area that is off-center to focus on), then look at the A95.<br /><br />Please note:  my review of the A75 is the same as the A85 because they are pretty much the same camera with the 1 megapixel different.  There are some differerences between my review of the A95 and this one."]},{"name":"Epson PhotoPC L-410","amazon_reviews":["The Epson Photo-PC L-410 is a very nice, very compact digital camera that is excellent for general family picture-taking duties.

However after 2 years of use, the screen stopped working, and with Konica Minolta no longer in operation, locating repair service has been troublesome.","I purchased a reconditioned X50 to replace a Minolta model Xt, which I also liked very much.  The 3.2 megapixel Xt performed great for me for 2 years, so I chose the X50 because of my previous experience with Konica Minolta cameras.  However, I have read that Konica Minolta has left the digital camera business, and this makes the X50 even more valuable to me.<br /><br />The camera has a superfast startup which occurs by simply sliding the lens cover open.  Honestly, the X50 is ready to shoot in less than 3 seconds.  I currently have four digital cameras and have probably owned twelve digicams over the last seven years, and none of them start as fast as the X50.<br /><br />Another plus is the compact size of the X50.  I carry this camera with me whenever I drive, as it fits neatly in my carry bag with my cell phone, medicines, and other essentials.  For me, this is a very important feature, because you can't take pictures if you don't have your camera, and you never know when you'll see something that might turn into a good picture. It also fits neatly into any available pocket, and the zoom lens is unique because it is non-protruding.<br /><br />The X50 has most of the features digicam users have come to expect: large LCD, numerous special picture settings, 3X optical zoom.  It also has a optical viewfinder, which can be useful in brightly lit outside situations.  By the way, in my opinion the X50 also takes great pictures.","I have read a few bad reviews for the X50, but most of them point out that they bought lemons. I think this has to do with the camera's size and intrinsic frailness if it is not assembled right. So, be sure you buy it someplace that will replace it or refund your money, so you will have recourse if you have this experience.<br /><br />With that caveat, I have to say that I am impressed very much with this sporty little camera. And it IS sporty. I've taken it out and not missed those interesting city street scenes I've always wanted to capture, when before I had been really frustrated by my slow and bulky fully manual camera. It's not just a point and shoot. It's a really fun camera to take out on the town and catch action shots with. That's not to say it doesn't have features that go beyond point and shoot that a lot of people just don't want to learn about or practice getting right It's not fully manual, OK, but I already have one of those and it is too bulky to take into the city and take great and interesting pictures of street scenes. This is the intended purpose for the X50 IMO.<br /><br />I had a Minolta G530, but I dropped it in some coffee and I've been without a small camera for a while. At first, I thought the G530 was better than the X50, but I am coming around to thinking the X50 will be just as good once I get better at quickly working some of the controls that are a layer or two down. The bright idea of Minolta, though, was to give you the ability to bring the function you think will be the most important for the current shooting situation to the first level of control. If you are in changing light with bright sun alternating with thick clouds, then bring the exposure compensation up to the first layer of control. You can do this with ISO sensitivity, quality settings (i.e., fine, normal, etc.) white balance, exposure compensation, metering mode, color mode, and the ability to change the 2\" LCD's brightness.  It takes excellent outdoors night shots, and I plan on taking it out with a tripod this weekend to see what it can really do with the 2.8 zoom. under city lights It seems like not much, but I think it will be able to use some of the digital zoom with the tripod. I will give my report afterwards.  (I know, what's the point of a small camera if you are going to use a tripod? The thing is, I have a half size tripod that I can collapse and carry in a backpack, or even in my jacket pocket.)  I will also take some shots without the tripod.  I've already done this with great results.<br /><br />As far as overall picture quality goes, it is quite good if you keep the ISO down. I have heard that if you make prints up to 8X10 they come out really well. On the computer screen, I have noticed a little noise, but it is almost not noticeable. There was no noise at all with the night shots.<br /><br />It also has some presets, but the only one I have used so far is the macro.<br /><br />I can only tell you my experience with the battery. I took it for a 4-hour walk yesterday and took about 100 shots on a 1-gig card. I had the power save on 1 min and the camera shut itself down dutifully and powered back up as soon as I touched the shutter button. I used the LCD for every shot and I still had some juice in the battery when I got home, although not much. Even so, I would recommend an extra battery, since you can't always be sure you will start out with a full charge on the one you have loaded into the camera. The battery charger is actually about the same size of the camera, so it would be no problem to carry it a jacket pocket if you were staying at a hotel, or visiting someone. It also has a changeable cable for the outlet, so when you travel to a foreign county, you can just pick up a local cord there.<br /><br />The internal zoom is a good feature too. Makes it faster to get it up and running - remember, I said \"sporty.\" There is another advantage to this, which is there is no external barrel to worry about. It also makes the camera that much sexier.<br /><br />I give it a 5,because I really like its smallness, which makes it quick with the ability to get those street scenes you would miss otherwise. If you want to use it for your kid's birthday party, then buy something else. You'll have to really work at overcoming the problems this camera has with contrasts with indoor scenes, like a boy or girl about to blow out the candles on the birthday cake in a low lit room. Size and sportiness might get you noticed by the other moms and dads there, but it's the pictures you really should care about - so buy a camera that is made for those situations. There are plenty of good ones to choose from.<br /><br />That's my take on the X50. Maybe they should have called it the X-15.","I spent almost 2 months searching the internet for a camera, when a friend recommened Konica Minolta. They had previously bought another model and loved it. I looked on the Minolta sight and saw this camera. However, I looked at the price range, and it was very far out of my budget. This seemed like the ideal camera for me, except for the price. It was small and very travel-friendly. I scanned ebay, and I found a great deal, for $100, new! I was delighted, and when it came, I tested it out, and it was perfect. I love this camera because of the size, the picture quality, and it's EXCELLET super macro mode. I had high expectations, and it met all of them. The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the internal optical zoom is a bit loud, and the battery life is questionable. But so far this has been a great camera for a beginner, like me, and I highly recommend it. If you are thinking of buying this camera, I would recommend you by a protective case for traveling and a screen protector.","After about 9 months of delicate use, the battery cover wouldn't stay on and the camera had to be returned.  Fortunately I bought it from Costco, otherwise I would have had to deal with the manufacturers warranty.  If you've never gone through that, then you're lucky, and you would be better off just buying a new camera.<br /><br />As far as the picture quality goes, it was ok for that size camera.  It's only expected.  However, for a 5.1mp camera, it really fell short, especially in low light situations.  Not to mention when using the flash.  You better be ready to blind the subjects you're taking a picture of, because you have to be pretty darn close or you'll lose the shot to fuzz, blurr, or whatever else.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm thinking of buying the X60 model since it looks like you get more for less.  My only concern, Costco no longer carries any of the Konica Minolta line.  Neither does BestBuy.  So if I buy it from Amazon.com, I'm probably on my own if it has a problem.<br /><br />If the picture quality was better and the battery cover didn't clunk out, then I'd give it 4 stars.","great pics, easy to use, overall great camera but...as other reviewers wrote, my LCD broke.  I put it in the case which is designed for the camera and placed the camera with the LCD side facing out (never thought about it) this puts the snap right on the LCD screen.  placed the camera in my handbag and leaned back.  the snap pressed on the LCD and broke the camera.  I can still take pics but can't see if they look good and can't see what setting the camera is on.  wrote to Minolta and have not gotten a response.  would I buy another one?  probably cause the price was reasonable and pics good but mad at minolta.","I bought this camerra by mistake, actually i was looked for a Canon AS95, i spent nearly a month to search Net to find out the best one...BUt u know, when i went to market, i was really confused and finally i bought this Dimage X50.the pictures taken are quite great if u use the suitableMode ( like for flowers, it works well, for taking pics in dark it also works well...)However, sometimes the colors are not presented truly, and pics are so noisy..that u may feel so regret buying it...it starts fast and the focus is set quickly, however, at big digital zoom, it realy works slowly and noisily...especialy fot text...u'll never be satisfied with the quality when u take pictures of text, so bad and noisy, blur also...one more thing, batteries: the worse thing here,u have to recharge usually as it works so badly, my work requires me to go and take pics frequently and i'm now so tired with charging the batteries everyday..<br /><br />Thus, i am not satisfied of it..hope i could return it but now impossible, feel so sad and dissapointed, hope i was bright to choose the Canon one...","Zap, zap, zap, in a flash you have taken it out of your pocket, taken a number of pictures and you hardly read the manual to figure out the features. Better than my Nikon, and Sony in all ways. A very smart camera. The finish is OK, but could be even better.","I now have Sony F717, Sony P8, and this Dimage X50. Overall speaking, it is superior to Sony P8 in terms of image sharpness, design, weight and LCD size. However, I found that the LCD display is not as good as that of sony's. Sometimes the display of LCD will simply blur and you cannot see what is going on there esp. when you zoom in or zoom out. Another problem with it is that the LCD is sort of fragile and tends to be easily broken (I wish that is only my guess). Since nothing is perfect, you have to ask yourself what is the most significant factor that you are looking for in any kinda Digital Cameras. For me, of course, it is the image quality and portability. Hence, the Ultra compact minolta X50 is a must keep for me. I have done a lot of research before I made this purchase, all the candidates I once looked at were Sony T-1, Canon SD300, Casio ex-x55. After a elaborate comparison and field test, I prefer this x50 for its best performance in image capture and also for its elegant design. Hope this is helpful for you.","I put some time into finding a good digital camera. Many people I meet at parties and social events pay a lot for bad quality name brand cameras that boast portability and style (ie, sony, canon's sd series), and I checked out most of these ultracompact cameras suggested to me. Most of them to be honest (maybe with the exception of the canon sd300) just didn't do it for me. I finally came across the dimage x50. This camera is UNDERRATED; the image quality is excellent, it has the flexibility to become a point-and-shoot camera or a manually adjustable camera, the color saturation is the best I've seen from cameras this small, and you can also have the option of recording captions to remind yourself why you took the picture or what it's about.<br /><br />I was looking at the canon sd300 and sony t1, very small cameras with power and many features, and I guess the deciding factor for me in going with the Dimage was that 1) its lens is non-protruding, unlike the Canon series. I've worked in electronic stores, and trust me--cameras frequently come in because the zoom lens won't function. 2) I think the overall quality is the best, not just due to higher MP, but just because the camera distinguishes colors a lot better than most other cameras and the final product (sans red-eye, blur--unlike the sony) is perfect.<br /><br />Finally, this camera has a cheaper price compared to other cameras in its class.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful.","Bought this camera during my trip to St Thomas in the Virgin Islands after my old Panasonic DMC-LC43 got washed down by a wave at the ocean. The main reason I bought it was the design and the super micro mode which lets me take extreme close ups (see my pic of a bee in the images section). Since almost all of my pictures are taken outdoors, the noise in dark pictures is not a factor; when I do take dark shots, I set the ISO to 50 and that gets rid of nearly all noise.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Sleek and small design<br /><br />-Great for close-ups<br /><br />-Customizable sounds (menu clicks, shutter, focus)<br /><br />-Slideshow function<br /><br />-WEBCAM function with decent quality video<br /><br />-Good quality video recording for the full card capacity<br /><br />-Good battery life<br /><br />-Lots of modes (sunset, landscape, portrait, etc)<br /><br />-Very quick start-up time<br /><br />...more<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Slight noise in dark pictures at auto ISO<br /><br />-The internal zoom lens is a little loud and sometimes gets stuck for a split second in the middle of the 'zooming' (while the button is pressed). This started about a week after I bought it. Works but sounds as if it's about to break every time it reaches the max/min zoom point.<br /><br />-Battery door is a lil wobbly.<br /><br />Got it for $300 at the duty-free store + an extra battery and case at a discount, so I consider it a great cam for the money. Overall 9/10.","I purchased this camera barely a month ago.  It is easy to use and takes great pictures.  But, it was accidently dropped the other day and the LCD screen broke.  I realize cameras aren't meant to be dropped but it happens.  I am disappointed in how easily the screen's crystal broke.  I am wondering if this not a defect due to the compact size.","I researched cameras for about 2 months before finally deciding on the DiMage X50.  I went to a camera store to check them out and found that the camera I really wanted hasn't been invented yet. (I wanted a large LCD screen (2-2.5 inch), and more than 3X zoom, and all in an ultra compact camera!)  It all came down to the Dimage X50 but I also looked at the Casio Exilim EX-Z55 which had a nice 2.5 inch LCD (but you need a dock to connect to a computer), and the Canon SD300. The viewfinder on the Canon was in the middle of the camera and was uncomfortable, as it hit my nose. (and I must say I have a small nose!)  The DiMage X50 came the closest to meeting all my needs.  I also liked the non protruding zoom lens and the metal cover that protects the lens and also acts to turn the camera on and off.<br /><br />My criteria was: a small camera I can keep in my purse, large LCD screen, optical viewfinder, fast startup and no/short lag time between pictures, USB connection to computer and connection to TV, movie with sound ability, easy to use, good picture quality, zoom (could be better - although you can zoom in on pictures using photo software).<br /><br />I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  I was very surprised when I took my first pictures in a dark restaurant.  The couple sitting across from us came out clear and without red eye!!  The camera is very easy to use.  I was taking pictures and movies before I even read the instructions, which I eventually did to find out how to use the camera correctly.  The pictures indoors as well as outdoors came out great.  Downloading them onto the computer was very fast and easy.<br /><br />I've been keeping the camera in an eyeglass case (men's vertical type) with no problem.  It's easy to carry in my purse without worrying that it will be damaged.  I did order the Minolta casual case for it and will see which works better when I receive the case.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this camera with no hesitation!!","This is one cool camera...it has all the buzzwords and is -physically - a dream. I wish I had known that the images would not quite be up to snuff. Before you disregard my post as flamebait or trolling by a camera snob, let me say that my last digital camera - which has very good image quality - was a $199 Fuji Finepix 1.3MP bought 4 years ago.<br /><br />The images are quite noisy in low contrast areas, especially in indoor lighting conditions.  The only way to mitigate the problem is to manually set the ISO to its lowest value - 50 - which will cause a lot of flash work on a camera with an f/5 telephoto lens. At the lowest setting, however, the pictures seem very nice. Although this workaround does allow it to produce acceptable images, you'll need to be more interested in the \"coolness\" of this super-mini camera to feel that its worth $350.<br /><br />I have a post over at steve's digicams forums which shows the noise problem. Just in case Amazon checks for links, you'll have to cut and paste this link into your browser:<br /><br />(...)","Just got my X50 today and I can't put it down.  I wasn't sure if I needed 5MP, but this is selling for cheaper than Minolta's older 3MP x-series cameras, so I thought I might as well go for 5MP.<br /><br />PROS: - Real thin, < 1 inch - fast power-on < 1 second - 2-inch LCD screen is sweet - above-expectation image quality - 5MP in a small body - 3x optical zoom - optical viewfinder (great for stabilizing your shots) - stylish - rechargable battery - looks and feels good - uses SD - 5MP at a good price<br /><br />CONS: - prop battery format","I just purchased this AWESOME ultracompact digital camera from my local camera store.  I am by no means a novice to the world of digital photography.  I bought my 1st digital camera (Nikon Coolpix 990) over 4 years ago for just under a thousand dollars. While it took great pictures, it was too bulky and a bit too easy to change the settings on the camera.  My 2nd digital camera was a SONY Mavica-that one had TERRIBLE photo quality.  My 3rd camera was the Canon S50 which is very highly rated butI had 3 problems with it- 1. It was too bulky to toss into my pocket. 2. The toggle switches are a pain to operate  (they eliminated them for the S60/70) 3. I was not blown away by the photo quality. To be honest, I think my Nikon Coolpix took better  indoor pictures and it only had 3 (vs 5) mega-pixels!  I have heard that Nikon utilizes some of the best photo lenses in the industry which result in great-looking pictures.  I was thinking about getting the Nikon Coolpix 3200 BUT the shutter speed is way too slow!  And it has a cheap, plastic body.  Then I read Mossberg's review of the Dimage X50 in the Wall Street Journal and was very intrigued.  So, I headed to my local camera store and purchased it (they have a 7 day return/exchange policy).  I took a bunch of pictures of my baby both indoors and out, and I was VERY IMPRESSED with the photo quality (for a camera this tiny)*.<br />UPDATE:<br />*Some reviewers complained about \"noisy\" pictures.  You have to factor that in when considering a digital camera purchase.  If you want pictures with no noise, then you have to use a much bigger camera like the Canon A95 or Sony W1.  Also, I don;t recommend buying an ultracompact camera as your primary or sole camera.  They are best for taking to parties or tossing them in your bag to capture spontaneous life moments. You shouldn't expect an ultacompact to produce museum quality pictures- it's simply not possible.  I truly believe that the XS50 offers one of the best photo quality in the arena of ultracompacts.<br /><br />Besides the high photo quality, there is A LOT I love about my 4th digital camera.  1st, the price is GREAT esp. when you consider the picture quality, TINY size, and zoom capability.  I think it's a STEAL! 2nd, the only thing I disagree with Mossberg is that he didn't think it looked very \"sleek\".  I love the all metal design - aside from the viewfinder, you will not find any cheap plastic parts.  Even the A/V out has a tiny metal door that slides up and down.  Not to be anti-American made but it's obvious that this was made in Japan.  It is also extremely EASY to use-the buttons are very intuitive.  I have yet to crack open the manual.  It also makes a soothing \"ding\" sound when the picture is in focus (not at all loud or annoying) so that you are assured a great picture!  Even though it is very small, the lay-out is great and NO TOGGLE SWITCHES.  And of course, having a  2\" LCD monitor is very helpful (and fun).  You don't have to squint into a tiny viewfinder!  The combined 12x zoom is VERY COOL-it's similsr to a submarine telescope and doesn't protude !<br /><br />The only thing I'm not crazy about is that it uses a proprietary battery but it's supposed to last for over a 150 pictures and using \"AA\" batteries would have added too much bulk.  Overall,<br />I am THRILLED with this camera!  I finally got (almost) EVERYTHING I was looking for in an ultracompact digital camera- Very Good photo quality, ease of use, tiny size, and a very FAST SHUTTER SPEED at a great price.  What more can you want?  Well, maybe a bigger memory card :-)","This isn't a hands-on review as are my other Amazon.com reviews.  The X50 hasn't been released yet as of today (9/18/04), but I just wanted to call your attention to a review in the Wall Street Journal written by Mossberg.  He compared four upcoming super-compact cameras and found this to have the best picture quality (although the least style).  I have owned half a dozen Minolta digital cameras and I think this will be another winner.  As I recently lost my job I guess I won't be buying anything for a while.  :(  But be sure to check out the WSJ review from 9/15/2004, page D1.<br /><br />(Konica and Minolta used to be two separate companies but they merged recently to form Konica-Minolta.)","This is the first digital camera have ever owned.

I narrow the search and I found 3 cameras with less than an inch macro focal distance (actually 1 centimeter since in my country we use the metric system). and this one was the only one that I could afford. well, when I put my hands on the box, unpack and see that was so tiny and the plastic case looks so cheap, I say \"wow, a fisher price digital camera\".<br /><br />but then this tiny monster probes me that you never must judge a book by his cover or a man by his clothe. I immediately put it on macro mode and take few shots. even with a less than zero knowledge about photography, I could take decent pics of my miniatures just taking out of the box. of course all in auto because I said, first time that I use a digital camera in my life and before that, few pics with an old polaroid.<br /><br />the thing is that I was impressed with the sharpness and the clarity of the pic. so much that I feel frustrated. yeah, I feel frustrated when I note that my good looking hand painted miniatures has brushes fails and misses that I couldn't note with my magnification glass and less with my bare eye.<br /><br />since that I work harder on my miniatures but the brutally awesome macro mode always find my fails and that is just using the circular fluorescent lamp og the magnification glass that I have in the painting table.<br /><br />but when the camera proves his endless worthiness in the macro miniature field then I move on, and star to take it with my to lots of metal concerts. I was really afraid because the camera looks really cheap and fragile, and I thought that my poor bayb will not gonna make it when the moshers starts to move.<br /><br />but not only get hits but dust, sweat and even beer and my beloved Z10 take the punishment as a sherman tank could do it. little local concerts, big metal foreign bands, crappy set of lights, awesome reflectors and lasers sets, really \"moving\" and exited crowd, the Z10 took everything, with great velocity, sharpness and clarity even when the general complain is his poor low light maneuverability. until know never disappoint me. iron maiden, kiss, cradle of filth, brujeria, obituary, was just few bands that visit my country and I take pictures so great that lots of people consider me a pro photographer and congratulate me for my talent. they just don't know about my \"secret weapon\". god I love my little camera.<br /><br />I take it to the shooting range too and take great pictures of the drills and competitions, and even could take awesome pictures of a mac 10 .45 ACP shooting a burst. but the real challenge for my cheap looking was not get broke when the big .300 RUM shoot. well, another challenge that accept and pass like the best.<br /><br />even a year ago I travel to Argentina to see Rammstein and Twisted Sister. the first one was my biggest concert till now. 45k people, all metal fans, and just me and my little camera to do the job. we couldn't reach the stage and the near distance that I got was like 20 meters (60 feet I think), and then the 8x optical zoom save my life. decent pictures of Till Linderman and Co, but the crowd was really wild and we get more hits than a piñata. at the next day I still have the marks of the viewfinder in my chest, neck and cheek, because we was crushed by the crowd but still, the Z10 do the job. sadly the dial get a little damage and now sometimes when I barely tough, jumps to the next mode. even that we take the awesome pics in the super poor and low light conditions of the Twisted Sister gig. I return home with awesome pictures of both gigs and Argentina but looking for a Purple Heart for my Z10.  =)<br /><br />I bought a fujifilm finepix s400 but simply was not so good, the optical zoom is great and 14 mp was great but the low light condition and focus velocity is really bad compared with the Z10. with the zoom out I feel shivers down my spine for just imagine that dropping from my hands. and of course lets not talk about the macro, where the Z10 kicks soooooo badly the fuji.<br /><br />actually the Z10 is a little bit retired. I have a Nikon D70s DSLR camera and a D5100 on the way. the fuji, I sold it, and my Konica Minolta will be me and die with me, I just simply can't sell it at any price (seriously, I have offer of almost 300$ and still say no), because she has a real sentimental value and even with a great lens like the sigma 17-70m 2.8-4 OS Macro, I still like more the macro pics of the Z10.<br /><br />at the end, if someday I have a kid, I will give teach him with the Nikons and then I will gift him the Z10 as heritage, because that camera is legendary!!!  =)","Hi, I just received a new camera as a gift so I am selling my Kinoca Minolta camera, but I have to tell you in all honesty  I AM IN LOVE with this camera.<br />It has a lower mega pixel then you can find in newer models, but you would NEVER know that from looking at the photos it takes.

I have decided to add additional cameras to my collection, but I'll hold on to this gem until she cant snap anymore!","I got this camera for Christmas in 2005.  It is my first digital camera and I must admit that when it dies, I will be so upset! I've taken this on two trips to Hawaii and have awesome pictures every time!! I even get great pictures of my animals around the house. I also took it with to both my proms and have excellent pictures!<br /><br />The Pros: Great zoom, Not small enough to lose, Great options I actually use, Doesn't eat up batteries<br /><br />The Cons: Nothing comes to mind!","Rumor has it Konica Minolta is getting out of doing digital cameras which is really a shame. This camera been wonderful since we got it 2 years ago. The first year we had it we stored over 2000 pictures on our computer making it easily pay for itself when compared to the standard camera it replaced.<br /><br />This camera takes crisp, quick pictures. For me the lag time is most important as we have small children. If the camera doesn't take the picture quickly it is useless. You do need to practice getting the camera locked into focus before taking the picture in order for it to be very fast but overall I have been able to take wonderful pictures of my children.<br /><br />The zoom and macro features are wonderful as well allowing me to get close up pictures and details on things that can be difficult with other cameras.<br /><br />The only downside could be the size of the camera as it cannot fit into a pocket. But for us this is actually a plus as it is not easily lost. For us, the zoom and the quality of the pictures make the bulk worthwhile.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera.","I have been using this camera for the past 2 years and it still works fabulous and it has all the great features what one will be looking at. Although 3MP is lesser than all the other cameras available in the market, the picture quality is awesome. I have taken lots of photos when driving in the car, I gotta say, it never shakes. I love this camera. And most of all the things its dirt cheap when compared for other cameras with the same quality,","I bought my camera from Amazon several weeks ago and took it on a trip to Turkey. The product has a lot of controversy: most love it, some hate it. Here is what I have to say:<br /><br />Overall, a great travel camera and outdoor pictures are just fantastic. 8x zoom is superb, you can really get smallish things in detail. Colors are great when outside. Macro functions are just awesome - you can bring camera to an inch from the object and get a crisp, clear picture! And tons of manual controls - you can control shutter speed, aperture, focus, sensitivity, which was particularly nice to get better quality snaps - I strongly recommend before you start taking pictures to read the manual carefully - it is good - and learn how to use all the features. It CAN be a point and shoot camera, but sometimes you just cannot count on using the automatic setup to get what you want. Until I did it, some pictures were disgraceful. When I learned the camera, most are amazing.<br /><br />Now, some problems:<br /><br />First two I quickly learned how to deal with:<br /><br />1. Night pictures often don't come out nice - use night portrait<br /><br />feature and white balance. HIGHLY recommended to get tripod if you want to shoot during the night<br /><br />2. Red colors are too conspicuous in indoor and night shots - once again, learn to use white balance!!!! Actually, most of it can also be made up for using their amazing imaging software - I really loved it, it works, and it is relevant.<br /><br />3. Now REAL problems - when indoors or bad light, autofocus may or may not work - it is pretty much the matter of luck. My only recommendation - take several pictures and see what comes out right. For this, I also recommend to have at least 256 mb SD card for this machine.<br /><br />4. And the shutter speed for indoor filming is unpredictable - once again, it may come up just right or may - well... get your pictures dark.<br /><br />The buttom line: if you need camera mostly for indoor use like taking pictures at the parties - probably, there are other models available for the price. If you are outdoorish, travel a lot and mostly take outside - this is an amazing buy for the money.<br /><br />And yes, it will look great on you! I heard 'nice camera' several times before I got to Istanbul.","I did lots and lots of research and this camera looked like the best deal for my daughter and me.  It did not disappoint me.  My 10-year-old had it up in running in no time with no previous camera experience.  The software is great even with my win98se O/S. It gives you many choices for resolution and quality (compression)but even at 640x480 it takes nice pictures, giving you 150 pictures on the 16M card it comes with. The max 3.2 megs on this is plenty of resolution unless you want to do posters.  What a deal. Made in Korea, and they can be picked up new for a song online with extended warranty.  I recommend Samsonite for the bag. They have a nice one at a decent price. The ergonomic design of this camera makes it hard to find a good bag.","I purchased this camera for my daughter on her 13th birthday.  She loves to take pictures but I hate spending the money to develop pictures that are duplicates or just not the greatest of pictures.  She & I both love this camera.  The book gives you detailed information on how to use it & the pictures are fabulous.  I have taken my own pictures of her & printed them out on photo paper with our all-in-one printer at home & they look just like the professional's do.  I don't regret this purchase at all.","This camera is GREAT for the price, It out performs my friends cameras who spent 3 times the money on the camera they use!<br /><br />DONT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO SAY IT CANT WORK WELL IN LOW LIGHT!<br /><br />If you read the book that comes with it, it tells you how to make it work well in low light/ night shots.<br /><br />and it does work well! :)<br /><br />All i have to say, this camera rocks!","I LOVE this camera... I bought it for around $175 and it takes just as better pics (if not better!) than my friends who have more expensive, higher tech cameras. I feel like a pro when I use this camera! My family has actually been amazed at the pictures I have taken, they really do look professional.  I wish I could post the pictures on here to show you! You won't regret this purchase! The only con I have is that there is no mic so there is no sound with the video, but I don't really take much video so it doesn't matter!","This is maybe my 14 or 15th digital camera. It is far and above my favorite as of right now. The digital viewfinder is excellent as is just about everything is on this camera.<br /><br />The only flaw or problem with it is the lack of ability to focus in low light, such as dusk or at night in the home with minimal room lighting. Last week I found a deer in my yard, I was able zoom into the face, but couldn't get the camera to focus lock. (It was just as the sun was setting) If you do much low light shooting, this camera is a pain.<br /><br />Daylight or average room lighting, this camera is OUTSTANDING.","This is my first digital camera.  Just like most other first-time buyers, I read reviews and product features.  A friend has a 10X zoom camera and I figured that for my needs I would want a camera that can get close-ups.  This camera is awesome!!!!  Not only is it great for beginners like me, I can also learn how to do better quality photos without becoming a rocket scientist.  It does more than I dreamed of with quality that even impresses my husband.  I was going to buy a camera at Christmas time, but when I saw the price on this -- well, let's just say I had Christmas in July.","Bought this camera while on holidays with my family just to email friends back home ,this exceeded all expectations.......took close to 200 pics with the batteries that came with it ,bought some 2500mAh rechargeables and this is just going.To top it off the camera looks impressive..","I picked this camera up from a department store as a dispaly model for $132.  With the savings I picked up two 256mb SD cards.  I am constantly amazed by this product.  Although it does have difficulty focusing at night, the lens cap is not attached and has a built-in only flash, the pictures I get are perfect for my needs and any color issues or red eye are just a mouse click from perfection!  I was prewarned by others to get an external power source and to always have extra batteries.  However, I've been pleasantly surprised with only two battery changes in well over 300 shots.  There seems to be layers and layers of built-in functions, options and modes that I haven't even begun to tap.  The optical zoom has enough power alone that I've rarely gone into the digital zoom, which is a function I haven't found to be useful on other cameras, let alone this one.  The movie mode is adequate for quick flicks, but there is no sound.  Fine by us as our digi camcorder covers that base.  Still very new to us, so time will tell.  But for now--very pleased!","The quality of the pics are outstanding. Autofocus is sharp and quick. Recharge between pics is fast. Batteries last a long time. The macro feature is incredible (Turn off flash if pic is washed out). The opitical zoom is good (Use a tripod or solid rest object for best results). IT's really easy to use so a beginner will be fine. It has manual features for more advanced fooling around.<br /><br />Best of all, it costs half as much as other cameras in this category.","Its been a week since I have owned this camera. I think it is a great camera for the price(below $200). The picture quality is awesome and 3.2 MP is more than enough. The best part of this camera are the ultra zoom, macro and amazing battery life. I have taken over 100 pictures and all of them are very clear. The macro mode of the camera is very cool. The shutter lag is hardly noticeable and better than most cameras including sony. The only concern of this camera is it takes some time to adjust the focus at night, but the delay is not much either. The lens cap is completely detachable from the camera. So you have to remember it to keep it at a safe place. Of the cameras I have researched this camera  offers amazing results for its price.","I bought the DiMAGE Z10 two weeks ago and I love it.  My pictures are very sharp.  I photographed my kids playing soccer & my son's birthday last week.  I see in reading another recent someone tried to shoot the moon at 1/1000th of second.  For the best results I suggest using a tripod and shooting at about 1/60th of second.  I highly recommend this digital camera, because it is great product at an amazing price.","This is my first digital camera and I did a lot of reading before I decided what camera I wanted to buy.  The 8 x optical zoom and the .4 in. macro option is what sold me on this camera.  I have had it for about two weeks now and have taken some great pictures.  I can not beleave the the detail I can get in my close up shots.  The only reason I did not give this camera a five is because once I take it off of auto I find it hard to figure out some of the other settings even when I have read how to do it in the manual.  I think this is a great camera for a beginner because it can grow with you."]},{"name":"Konica Minolta DiMAGE Z3","amazon_reviews":["I liked this camera from before it was discontinued and was delighted to find new unit with Wall Street Photo.

I still love it.  The main reason I purchased it was the small size and the 5 mp lens.  (I was replacing an older, larger 3 mp digital camera.)  In short, I wanted a compact point-and-shoot camera with a decent size (at least 5 mp) lens.  For this purpose, it exceeds all expectations.  I purchased a small case that fits on my belt and I can take this camera anywhere and almost anytime - it is fun to pull out a camera at parties for candid shots.  I also found that this camera is sturdy enough for outdoor activities.  I have taken it snow skiing (cold weather) and on a 5 day trip down the Yampa River (hot weather) and it survived and worked fine.  That said, stating what should be obvious, if you are looking for professional quality pix, this camera definitely is not for you.  Pictures in the 5 x 7 size look great, and 8 x 10 size still look pretty good, but I venture to guess that quality decreases measurably with any larger size pictures.  Also, what should be obvious with any similar type camera, you need a larger memory card (256 or 512 mp) and a backup battery (especially if you don't have access to electric outlets).  All in all, a great compact point-and-shoot camera.","I got this camera about 3 or 4 months ago. I bought it as a birthday present to myself [= (14 years old). At that time, I think that I payed about $200 for it because it was on sale since it was just coming out. Now I see that it can go up to almost $450 with any sales or any of that stuff.<br /><br />As for the performance...<br /><br />It works really well. Takes good pictures, and easy to use. I would strongly recommend to leave the flash on at all times (even if you dont really need it) because it keeps your pictures from being blurry--I dont know how... it just does.

It's a nice looking, nicely made little camera. A little thicker than some other miniature cameras though, and the square shape wasn't particularly easy to hold on to. Still, it's pretty nice looking.<br /><br />I liked the speed it starts up: the lens really romps out of the body. It has a good sized screen too, but it's not so great in sunlight, and very dim and grainy in poor light. Focussing in poor light was nothing special either; there's no assist lamp.<br /><br />It's simple to use, despite the lack of the more usual (and better) four-way controller. You access up and down menu items with the oddly (and badly) positioned zoom controller, which has an unpleasantly short travel and `clicky' feel to it.<br /><br />In playback mode, you use it to zoom in to your photo, which it does extremely slowly, then enter a different mode to scroll. Rather clumsy.<br /><br />Anyway, I managed to master all its functions without looking at the instruction book, so it must be quite intuitive.<br /><br />I was distinctly underwhelmed by the photos the Fuji took though. They were okay for snapshots but looking closely revealed lots of noise and rather fuzzy edges to things. My 4MP Canon Ixus takes much better, sharper photos. I don't think the Fuji makes much use of that extra megapixel.<br /><br />Even so, it's not a bad little camera. It's cheap, looks nice, is a doddle to use despite the awkward controls, has a reasonably large and colourful screen and starts up quickly. I wasn't too impressed by its primary function though: taking good photos. If you just take snapshots and print at small sizes it'll be fine. But then you wouldn't need 5 megapixels...","Looks like ma' boy in the prev review has said it all.<br /><br />I have always loved Fuji cameras. The S2800 I had before delivered astounding results for a 2MP camera convincing me to go for Fuji again, after a real bad experience with the Sony DSC-T1 (DON\"T BUY THE T1!!!!- IF U GOT IT FOR FREE PLEASE TRASH IMMEDIATELY. THAT'S WHERE IT BELONGS). I have the F450-the 5MP version. Got it for $275 off of ebay, where else!The flash is really good for a camera this size. I bought a \"perfect-fit\" case with a belt loop and the camera became instantly more-portable and easy to carry around. Nice camera! Value for money. Try it out! But u need to decide what u want in a camera first. I wanted something small enough to carry around,and one that gave nice pics. This was/is definitely a good choice!","Nov. 27, 2004--<br />I just got this camera today, and due to the lack of reviews, was a bit concerned about purchasing it. However my cousin owns the F420 and I noticed the high quality of Fujifilm cameras (co-operated with Olympus in Japan- where Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus all originate). The camera is even smaller than I initially thought looking at pictures online. It literally fits right into the palm of my hand. The hugh LCD is also a great feature. I haven't used the camera too much yet, but already taking test pictures I have noticed the Fujifilm quality. I have researched greatly into several compact cameras, such as the Sony T1 and the Nikon Coolpixes. Nikon lenses are very good also, but I preferred the compact square size and design of the Fuji, not to mention the larger LCD. As for the T1, my friend owns it, and at first the design of it and the huge LCD greatly impressed me, but the quality was just ughhh >:o( horrible. Besides my old digi cam was a Sony one and let's just say it's safe to stick to a FILM company. The picture cradle, the tiny xd picture card, battery, and etc. are wonderful. Everything looks great..!<br />To sum it all up..<br /><br />PROS:<br />*great compact, sleek design!<br />*large 2\" LCD<br />*hand strap comes included (just in case [:)<br />*Fujifilm quality<br />*Trimming on the camera available. (It's like cropping/editing on your camera!)<br />*Pictbridge compatible (for those who love to print pics directly)<br />*Video recording with audio (The larger your memory card, the longer you can record! With 512 mbs. you can record up to 156.3 minutes!) Plus the audio is actually pretty clear (you can adjust volume in the playback menu).<br /><br />CONS:<br />*I wish there was a better optical zoom, although 3.4 is pretty standard.<br /><br />Finally, for accessories, must haves are a higher xD-Picture Card, higher battery, and an optional PictBridge photo printer.<br />I bought a 128mb card, but I recommend a 256 or even 512, of course it all depends on how many pictures you feel you are going to take. (You can adjust the mega-pixels, giving you more or less photos).<br /><br />I hope this review was of some help! On a side note, I love this camera! (:<br /><br />**EDIT*****Feb. 28, 2005<br />It has now been about 3 months with this camera and unfortunately the review ^(up) there, may have been partially a \"just out-of-the-box\" review.<br />Basically my stand is the same, although I thought I should warn buyers of these types of small cameras...<br /><br />*IF YOU ARE IMAGINING TAKING PROFESSIONAL PICS with this camera, forget it.<br />Yes it has a 5.2 MP capability, so it's good for prints, but MP is not everything.<br />All these types of small cameras coming out these days (e.g. Sony T1, T11, etc.)have a tendency to produce blurry pictures.<br />Even though a picture taken on this camera's 2\" LCD may appear clear/sharp, an upload onto your computer may produce different results.<br />What I have noticed is that outside, pictures for the most part come out very clear.<br />The majority of blurry pictures occur inside, when there is not much lighting (obviously).<br />This camera requires a very steady hand; less so outside, but indoor pictures very much so.<br />Basically, the camera requires the shutter to be pressed half-way to autofocus, and the remaining half pressed to take the picture.<br />I'm only a student, so I mostly find content with this camera, because it's a nice-looking gadget.<br />No one has failed to express their interest in it or praise it for it's beautiful design.<br />Nevertheless, I highly recommend shoppers to consider what they are looking for in a camera as their first priority in their perfect digital camera search.<br /><br />Another important factor to keep in mind is that it is not only this camera that will be producing such results. I have taken a look at my friend's Sony T1, but there is no such \"perfect\" camera...yet.<br />If you want design, the chances of sacrificing an amount of quality is quite high, and vice versa.<br />All small cameras will have a higher tendency to blur, because that's what they are-- small.<br />The larger and heavier the body of the camera, it is better able to steady itself, while smaller and lighter cameras, such as this one, will need the guidance of a steady hand to create similar photos.<br />I believe this camera has better photo quality than the SONY T1, because it's lenses actually \"zoom\" out, while the SONY one, just zooms internally.<br />Also, my friend's SONY T1's prints were uncomparable to the prints from the F450 (considering all the small different factors, e.g. where the prints were printed, etc.).<br />The SONY's color outside was so dead compared to the F450's vivid colors.<br /><br />As for the big question..<br />No, I do not regret purchasing this item.<br />I enjoy the beauty of it, while using it and enjoy showing it off (not to appear condescending in any manner..)."]},{"name":"Konica Minolta DiMAGE X31","amazon_reviews":["The Seller was courteous and prompt.

Specifically, I needed a point-and-shoot on a European trip on which I wouldn't be able to lug my lenses and SLR bag around.<br /><br />The S60 proved a more than worthy backup.  The full set of manual controls (including features that many other manual point-and shoots don't have like 2nd curtain flash and auto exposure bracketing) along with the wonderful image quality made this a great buy.  There are a few design and function annoyances (the silly sliding lens door, proprietary rechargable battery rather than AA batteries, and difficulty in achieving intended effects with large apertures in aperture priority mode) but overall this is a great little camera that produces great images.  I also was interested in the Canon A610, but it was not released in time for my trip.","For a complete beginner this camera seems to do all I need easily and not too complicated.  It is automatic but as I learn I can use its more advanced features.","It is quite a bit bigger than the s400 I used earlier. But the wide angle lens, extra zoom and manual controls make it worth the extra size. Slight barrel distortion is visible in some photographs. The flash is quite powerful. Quick, reliable delivery and competetive price from amazon.com.","Pros:<br /><br />1. Almost all manual controls available. Takes some time to learn how to use many of them. But once you know, it is wonderful<br /><br />2. RAW image availability. So that you can make changes to the photos later while you are learning<br /><br />3. Good battery life. Good response time. Good flash<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />1. Image quality could be slightly better. But that might have been my fault too. I saw better images from the Sony T series and even a Fuji camera which my friend had.","This camara is very easy to use. I didn't have to read the manual. It's a little too heavy for my purse but it take great photos. I love the wide angle lense which makes my job easier. I no longer have to piece photos together in photoshop. It will do it automatically, when you take the photos. Great camara. Very professional quality and excellent resolution. The battery last longer than other camaras. Everyone is always asking me to recommend a great camara-this is the one for me.","I always believe that canon makes the best digital camera. No issues at all. Works as expected. Amazon delivery arrives in 3 days for the 3 - 5 days shipment. I am very happy with Amazon's service.","This is a great little camera. I have found it easy to use, but the flash is to strong for the camera. If you stand off at a distance and zoom-in the flash works better that way. If you stand to close it over exposes the picture leaving bright light spots.<br /><br />I think it is a good buy for the money though. I've taken some nice pictures with it.","I bought this one to replace a Powershot S40 that was stolen after a break-in. It works well and is a good compromise between point-and-shoot and a pro-style camera.<br /><br />It looks nice and takes good pictures.","I do not understand how anyone can criticize the quality of the photos from the Canon S60.<br /><br />I just returned from Hawaii, where I shot over 250 photos, ranging from the beautiful scenery to the Hawaiian people to the hotels in which I was staying. Out of the over 250 shots I took, I may have blown 3 and those were my fault (mostly poor composition). Every shot was superbly sharp, perfectly exposed, even if flash was used, and perfectly in focus. The only criticism that I would make and that is the reason that I am considering a digital SLR, is that it is very difficult to frame each photo perfectly using the eye level viewfinder.<br />On the other hand, if I use the LCD, it is much more difficult to hold the camera steady, particularly in marginal light situations. Of course, this is not the fault of the specific camera, but occurs with all non SLR point and shoots. I have used<br />and owned many digitals and, in my opinion, the Canon S60 is the best!","I have had it for 6 months now.  I bought it to replace my A70, which took a beating during my 3 months vacation.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />Wide angle rules.  Fast startup and shut down.  Good quality in/our-door.  AF assist light helps during poor light condition.  Good battery.  Panoramic/photo stitching is cool.  Good software bundle.  Good quality and reliable (from my prior experience).<br /><br />Con:<br /><br />No image stablization.  Which would be very helpful at night shoots w/o tripod, max zoom, or any other conditions.  Can not force flash at the \"AUTO\" mode.<br /><br />That's about it.","This is my first digital camera.  I delayed purchasing one until performance for value seemed to be just right.  This camera does an outstanding job for a very fair price.  Simple to use but still lots of added features if you wish.  Beautiful photos are easy to take.  And the small size makes it easy to carry along wherever you go.  Only criticism is the shudder door easily opens whenever I try to slide the camera into the custom-fit carry case.","A complete review of the camera is found at another camera review site which it seems Mr. Burke has visited to get some of his comments.<br /><br />All I can say is have the camera and love it so far. Also have a G5 at work, S200 for portability.  The S60 is my camera that melds portability and flexibility together.  And most importantly for those who are familiar and long time Canon users.  No E18 errors at all","What we have here is quite simply a compact G5.  Forget the swivel LCD screen - for me not at all useful, the only thing missing of any consequence from the G5 in my opinion is the flash shoe, otherwise you basically have a G5 in a much smaller more functional package.<br /><br />The pictures are quite simply fantastic!  Only minimal purple fringing and only noticeable to the most discerning (read nit-picking).<br /><br />The camera still suffers from the digital point and shoot shutter lag which for the most part plagues all point and shoots.  It is certainly no worse than the G5.<br /><br />One clear advantage over the previous S50 is its smaller size.  The camera still has the sliding lens cover which some object to but I find no problem whatsoever.<br /><br />The only dilemma facing the prospective buyer is whether to purchase this camera or the significantly smaller S500.  The S60 being a more capable complete camera than the S60.  My advice:  If this is your only digital camera, buy the S60.  If you have a digital SLR then buy the S500 for true portability.  The good news is that whatever decision you make you should be very pleased because both are great cameras.<br /><br />If you haven't taken the digital plunge, then take it from one who resisted much too long.  Go out and buy a digital camera TODAY!!  It will reawaken you interest in photography.  IMO, digital photography is the current killer app for PC's right behind the internet.  Good luck.","The canon s60 feature & performance wise, falls somewhere between a point-and-shoot and a pro-sumer level 5MP digital camera. I had originally planned on getting a G5, but the G5's unwielding size and weight (although a great performer) made me consider the newly released s60. I was looking for a portable pro-sumer, 5MP digital camera, that was no bigger than our Canon SureShot 35mm film camera. The s60 (and the ultra compact s400) both have the same CCD imager as the G5, but I chose the s60's 28mm wide angle lens, extra feature set, and longer battery life over the p500's.<br /><br /> From my experience, taking pictures indoors with a flash seems to be the biggest hurdle for any digital camera to overcome, and the s60, while not perfect, is one of the best indoor cameras of its size I have tried. Indoors, in a moderately lit room, the s60 in AUTO mode takes true color, well exposed images within 10 feet of the subject(s). I have found that using \"P\" mode with the flash exposure compensation set up to + 1/3 or +2/3 works best if you are in a poorly lit room and you also wish to see the background.<br /><br /> While it is true that there is some barrel distortion at full wide 28mm mode, it is not enough of a problem detract from it's overall rating. All compact and ultra compact cameras I have tried have had some barrel distortion at wide field and chromatic aberation on bright objects. As far as one person's comment about the images being blurry because of inferior lens quality, I would have to disagree. The images I have taken are very smooth and have vibrant, true colors. The s60 does apply a sort or internal anti-aliasing to smooth out the images. Most of the professional portraiture cameras (like the Kodak pro cameras) do this either in software or by hardware, as most people do not wish to see every facial pore on their subject. You can chose to \"sharpen\" internally on the s60, or just use one pass of Sharpen in Photoshop to sharpen the images even more to suit your taste.<br /><br /> I also had the opportuntity to compare the G5 and s60 side-by-side, by taking photos of the same subjects both indoors and out. I could not see any noticeable difference between the two, image quality-wise. I have taken over 200 images within the last 5 days with my s60 and have been very pleased with both its image quality and ease of use.","I originally had an S50 until it was stolen, so after much new research I replaced it with the S60. The focusing is much improved over my original S50. Although friends who also had the same camera never seemed to have focusing problems. The navigation buttons on the back of the camera have been improved. It is definately lighter than the S50, which is a bonus for those carrying the camera hiking or climbing. And, its start up time is good if you need to capture a picture really quick. So far it has handled all sorts of lighting conditions very well, and the color definition has been excellent with very little (if any) purple tinting. This is a very feature rich camera, if you like gadgets. However, it is also easy to use when set to fully automatic. The photo software it comes with is much improved, and is an acceptable choice if you don't have the money to buy something like Photoshop. I like the rugged, solid feel of the camera overall.<br />What I don't like about it is the slidable lens cover. I keep bumping it when it is open because of the way I like to hold the camera. The cover extends almost to the right hand side of the camera. If you bump it during picture taking, it shuts down the camera and you don't get your picture. This has happened to me maybe a half a dozen times. I have to consciously force myself to hold the camera as to not disturb the cover when it is open. Maybe in the future canon can move it back from the edge a bit, or reduce the sensitivity of the mechanism that shuts the camera down. Last, this camera isn't design for use in the shirt pocket. If you are looking for a pocket camera this one is a bit big.","I was looking for a digital camera that has many features as SLR does, yet want it small enough that it's convinient for me to carry it anywhere to do a lot of photographs. I got S60 and so far I'm satisfied with it.<br /><br />The camera produced sharp images and good color balance. And the camera gets ready fast enough to shoot after we turn it on.<br /><br />Though I took many pictures with it and reviewed the images many times, I found out that the battery is long-lasting.<br /><br />I also like the software that puts the picture in folders titled by the date automatically. So I can choose not to print date on the pictures.<br /><br />However, sometimes it's quite hard to slide open your camera when your hand is sweaty. And also almost every single time I take the camera out of my pocket, I slide open the battery door. Yet, they are not a big deal to me.","If you're a digital SLR user with some old IBM Microdrives and high-capacity thick CF cards this is a good point-and-shoot camera.  Most of the smaller P&S cameras today take the newer smaller xD cards so you end up having to manage an inventory of different kinds of storage devices.  The S60 can share memory cards with full-size digital SLRs.<br />How does the camera work?  Like any other point-and-shoot at around the same price, more or less.  It is more responsive than older cameras but still takes a second or two to turn on or wake up, long enough to lose the moment.  The menus and controls will be intuitive for anyone who has used Canon digital cameras before.  The 28mm equivalent perspective lens is a nice feature.<br />You'll get better pictures with a Digital Rebel or Nikon D70 if only because those cameras have better viewfinders and controls large enough to operate by feel.  But you can't fit one of those digital SLRs in your pocket...","This is the first small digital camera that gives me most of the options, and picture quality of my SLR film cameras.  And it fits in a pocket.  The wide angle pictures (28mm equivalent to 35mm) are awesome.  Edge to edge sharpness is superb and contrast is VERY good.  The tiny ends of the corners (NOT the edges of the frame), only at wide angle, look a little soft, but not noticeable in \"normal\" photos.  The person who says he has un-sharp edges in wide angle images either has a defective camera or has a beef to grind.  The edges are absolutely no problem at 28mm.<br />I sent out some wide angle images to have eight 5x7 prints, and two 8x10's made into prints.  When I got them back I inspected the corners carefully only to find the corners were as sharp as a tack.  Turns out the frame corners are trimmed to fit regular size paper, duh!<br />Ergonomics are great.  Controls are much improved over the previous S-series cameras.  Focus is fast, my S60 takes about .60 of a second to confirm focus.  If there is any shutter lag, I can't tell.  The new lens finds focus in low light much more consistently than the S500.  I have tried shooting all day, with some flash, and a lot of image reviews on the LCD, and I haven't run down the new high capacity battery yet.  The manual options are extensive, intuitive, and very useful for achieving serious high quality prints.  The ability to review an image almost instantly by pressing one button, and instantly returning to shooting mode by pressing the shutter button half way down is a real time saver.<br />Pros:<br />Amazing lens quality considering at wide angle, this really a 5.8mm lens!  Barrel distortion at 28mm is very acceptable and consistent with other wide angle lenses.  Macro and tele shots are beautiful.<br />Full manual control (even focus), several auto bracketing options, and very flexible AF and AE options and features.<br />RAW mode.  The Canon RAW software is a bit slow, but this is the way to go if you are into digital darkroom techniques and large prints.<br />Long Lasting battery that charges very quickly.<br />LCD screen is very sharp and smooth looking.<br />Very clean and smooth iso50 and iso100 images.<br />5mp.  After working with other 4mp images, the extra 1mp really shows up when preparing an image for an 11 x 14 print or larger.<br />Small enough to take anywhere.<br />Build quality.  Mostly metal.  The battery door is plastic, but this seems to be the trend with all small cameras.<br />User control of in-camera contrast, sharpness, and color saturation.<br />Custom setting that remembers and recalls all user settings.<br />Cons:<br />Won't fit in a shirt pocket or tight pant pockets well as the S500.<br />Sliding lens \"door\" takes getting used to, but seems very secure.<br />No anti-reflective coating on the LCD screen.<br />Iso 200 is somewhat noisy, and iso400 is noisy, but not as noisy as our S500 at iso400.<br />Histogram is only available on playback.<br />Battery door should latch more tightly.<br />No spare batteries (the new type) available yet anywhere.<br />Conclusion - If you are a photography enthusiast, this is the best way to achieve very high quality (user controllable) images in a very portable, flexible camera.  The S60 is a fantastic bargain.","I just bought the Powershot S60 at a store in Santa Monica, CA, and so far I am very impressed. I am not an expert photographer and my previous experience with digital cameras were with a lass that 1 megapixel diskette sony mavica and a week using the Sony DSC-P92 - 5 megapixels (wich I also liked).<br />This camera has a great advantage: It's wide angle zoom goes to the 28mm(35mm equivalent). This is great for shooting people, specially making them fit into the frame in small rooms and for landscapes. It has lots of bells and whisels that I am still learning to use and yet, it simple to use as a point and shoot.<br />My more expensive choice would be a Olympus C8080, but that was beyond budget. Because it has a small format you will not get to add filters except if you install that cumbersome adapter (you can filter afterwards with Photoshop). It doesn't have an external flash socket so you will use the built in only. The other great issue of this camera is that it's portable. More sophisticated (pro) cameras like the C8080 are not so easy to carry, specially if traveling with kids.<br />To decide for this camera it helped a lot to research on [...] although they didn't do a final review on this one yet. On the accessories I passed on the carrying case (read reviews on amazon) and looking forward to get the remote control.","Hey yo,<br />I liked the S50 model a lot and the pictures were good except ...in some pictures the object appears to be bigger than it actually is. Fat people would appear fatter(maybe due to my settings). The other major disadvantage with S50 was its bulkyness and the sliding mechanism that makes it feel like that is going to break soon.<br />S60 is slimmer. Fat people appear fat, not fatter then they are. Put the camera in ur shirt pocket and go on where ever u wanna go. Its not a burgen to carry it but its not as sleek as the s400/500. You get a few additional features as a compromise for the sleekness of an S500. The pictures are sharp and the details are good.<br />Canon is a safe bet. The quality should be good if history is an indicator. But the new lens on this camera is not as widely used and tested and there might be a few errors and surprises.<br />The price seems reasonable for a 5 mp.  Its surely going down. Buy it after a few months ..during thanksgiving or xmas for a bargain. If u cant wait, go for it. You might have a few complaints but wont be disappointed for sure."]},{"name":"Kodak EasyShare CX7330","amazon_reviews":["I bought my camera used.

Every time I go to take a picture (every month or two) the batteries are dead.  And don't try to put in batteries that are less than fully charged.  It won't work unless the batteries are brand new at full charge.  So I went and bought some Duracell rechargeable batteries.  After sitting on the charger, the batteries still aren't at the charge it takes to operate this camera.  JUNK!  Do not buy a Kodak!!<br /><br />And yes, I have the preview window turned off to conserve battery life.<br /><br />2/2/2010:  Update.  I was totally wrong about this camera.  The battery life is fine when you buy good batteries.  I was using nothing but Duracell batteries.  I guess Duracell's quality control department isn't doing its job because as soon as I switched to cheapo Walgreens batteries, it worked fine.  Now I only have to change batteries every 6 months or so.","I purchased a refurbished model in December 2005 and fell in love with it instantly. I was a bit bummed at first because I could only afford 3 megapixels, but this camera takes amazing pictures! I am a photography buff and this camera (3 megapixels and all) fed my fetish perfectly. Unfortunately, I recently lost my camera to a hail storm and because I loved this EasyShare so much, I replaced it with another EasyShare model (C713 in pink). It would have lasted me much, much longer, but even though it is a well-made, high-quality camera, it is no match for mother nature.<br />I definitely recommend this camera to anyone who is just starting out in photography or needs an easy-to-use, no-frills model for the family. I would even recommend it for children and am also considering buying one for each of my nephews (ages 8 and 6). In fact, it is so easy for kids to use, they have borrowed it from me on occassion and have taken some great snapshots.","This camera doesn't have a cool look, though it does a great job!  The photos are not that good when it is displayed on the LCD screen.  Once you uploaded it to the PC, the quality is much better.  I first thought that this wouldn't be a decent camera because it is only 3MP.  But it turns out that I like it so much that I am not even bothering to look for a higher MP camera.  I strongly recommend this camera!","I bought this little guy with my second paycheck as a teacher.  That was about threee years ago and to this day I still have no desire to look for a different camera.  This little guy is awesome.<br /><br />I highly recommend you learning how to get a steady hand if you want to use the digital zoom but that goes with every digital gadget around.  If you can hold a camera still (I sometimes use a tripod, the same one I use for my video camera) you can get great shots.  I have taken pictures in the mountains of Colorado from Golden (Lookout Mountain) and have good pictures of the Denver Skyline.<br /><br />Low light pictures are not the best.  My wife used the camera when we were in St. Peters Basilica and the quality dropped.  I will let you decide if it was the lighting or the user :)<br /><br />The auto function on the camera is excellent for almost all types of pictures.  You could buy the camera and never use any of the other functions (not real fun though) and get great pictures.<br /><br />Great camera","This is a pretty standard digital camera; for those of you who want something simple and easy to use, without many advanced/special features, this is a good camera for you.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Easy to use; the buttons are pretty much right in front of you.<br /><br />-6 different modes; an auto for general use, one for objects in motion, one for dark scenes, one for landscapes, and one for close-ups. It also has a video option.<br /><br />-It's not incredibly small, but it'll fit in your pocket.<br /><br />-If you turn the live view off (where you see the image on the screen before taking the photo), the battery life is pretty good (just don't take many videos). A few days ago, I took about 60 pictures and about 10 videos that were about 20 seconds each.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-It can't take pictures in the dark. Or, for that matter, anything without a big, visible light source. When in auto mode, the pictures become waay to dark and undefined, but the shutter speed for the night mode is ridiculously long, so no matter how still your subject/hand is, it'll be too blurry.<br /><br />-The batteries fall out easily. Twice during concerts, I've lost batteries because I rubbed against the bottom of the camera.<br /><br />-The zoom isn't terrific. In fact, it doesn't really 'zoom in' at all; the closest you can get on any mode except for close-up is the same as you'd see through your naked eye. But that's where the close-up feature comes in handy. (It's only if you want great detail on objects near you, such as flowers; any further and it's just a big blur)<br /><br />-Without a tripod and a still subject, it's hard to get clear photos on the night and close-up mode.<br /><br />You can get decent photos with this camera under the right conditions, but this is just a simple camera for unprofessional images. Probably good if you're on a family vacation to Disneyland, or on an outing with friends. In broad daylight, that is. It's not necessarily a bad camera, but it was insufficient for my needs. And yes, this is a horrible camera to take to concerts.","I got this camera for Christmas in 2004 after seeing it in the flyer at Circuit City. I was so happy, I had finally gotten a REAL digital camera (previously I had owned a cheap Vivitar 3555 with no optical zoom). As this camera nears the end of it's second year of use, it has sustained little damage unlike others have contested, and image quality is still high above par for a 3 MP camera.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />* Great bang for your buck, got this camera for $150 and has lasted 2 years<br /><br />* Exceeds expectations of 3 MP camera. Quality was unsurpassed by any other comparable camera<br /><br />* Good ergonomics<br /><br />* Simple controls for the beginning user<br /><br />* Optical zoom performs flawlessly<br /><br />* Lens seems to be of good quality, despite being manufactured by Kodak instead of a more prestigious company<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />* Seems to be \"hit and miss\" on durability, in my case more of a \"hit\"<br /><br />* Flash does not suffice in certain situations<br /><br />* Battery life sucks (get rechargeables, work somewhat better)<br /><br />* No EVF (electronic viewfinder)<br /><br />* Screen can sometimes be hard to see, especially in bright settings<br /><br />* Horrendous Kodak software (use a memory card reader instead)<br /><br />Although this camera has outlasted over 1500 photos across the United States, she is being retired as of this October. I have felt the need to take photography to another step, graduating to the super-zoom Panasonic DMC-FZ7. I confirmed this preliminary choice when I dropped this camera in San Francisco on vacation, cracking the plastic over the LCD screen. Amazingly, the screen still works; just goes to show its durability (in my case that is). I would recommend this camera to any beginner user, yet there are cameras of comparable price that are better, as this camera is 2 years old.","I've had my Kodak for about two years now, and it's been a great little camera, with a few important drawbacks.<br /><br />It takes reasonably clear photos, especially considering that it's only 3.1mps.  I've made 8x10's which have been quite good although it does best at 5x7 size.<br /><br />There are a few things that are a bit off-putting.  First is the length of time it takes this camera to get ready to shoot from an \"off\" position.  Second, there is a considerable shutter lag, even when you've done the requisite prefocusing which can be a problem if you plan to shoot subjects \"in action\".  Third, this camera is not at its best in indoor lighting situations using the flash, although my husband points out that I am also incredibly picky where my photos are involved, so others may not be as bothered by variations in skin tone as I am.<br /><br />That said, this is an amazing little camera I would recommend to anyone.  It's sturdy, and can take a few accidental bumps without breaking.  It can create some really good photos.  And, for the mp number, the resolution is great.","I have had this camera for a year and a half now and I have to say, it is a good little camera. It takes great, clear pictures, and has held up to lots of wear and tear. My only problem with it, and it's the reason I am buying a different brand next time, is the battery life!!! It sux!!! As in, sucks the life out of batteries in no time flat! I have learned to not use the LCD screen if neccessary, to save batteries, but even then, they don't last long. Overall it's a good camera, but if you are looking for long lasting battery life, this is not the camera for you. If you don't mind charging your lithium batteries all the time, or going through AA batteries like candy, then this is the camera to get.","I love this camera!!  It is so easy to use--easiest that I have found.  I take a lot of pictures and it does exactly what I need it to do.  It takes great pics!!  They are so clear and sharpe.  I would recommend it to anyone!!","This was my first camera that I bought and it takes GREAT photos. The closeup mode works really well. In fact, once I took a picture of my sea monkies and they came out really nice! Comparing to my other friend's camera's, they all say that mine takes great photos for that price.","I just love this camera. It takes great photo's and its very easy to use. Excellent choice for beginers and still a good pick if taking pictures is your main thing. I had this camera for a while now and it still works like new. The only problem i had is that, i droped it once and the battery cover came off instantly and i had difficulty making it stay on. Overall, this is a great pick!","I love my camera!  I've had other dig. cameras, but this one is easy to use, cost was minimal, and takes amazing pictures!  The other features I love about this camera is all the settings you have for picture taking...time/date stamp, sports/action, and the video quality is amazing!  I've had so many people ask me what kind of camera I have because my pictures come out so nicely.","I've had this camera for 2 years. For a 3 Mp camera, it takes fantastic shots with bright colors indoor and outdoors.<br /><br />It has slow auto focus and a lot of lag between pictures while its processing the file, is USB 1.1, eats up AA batteries (dont they all) and is not really pocket size.<br /><br />Not a lot of manual controls but a very good first timer camera.<br /><br />However, there are newer and better cameras out there for the price now.","While researching to buy a digital camera I narrowed my search down to two Kodak Easy Share cameras.  This was the one I bought because the other model I wanted was not available where I bought it.  The only downside to this camera is, like many have said, is when you turn it off it resets your chosen flash settings.  The initial battery does not last long at all, but I recommend a pack of Energizer E2 batteries as they have quite a long life, or the rechargeable batteries Kodak recommends.  It also has an auto-shutoff feature to conserve batteries.  This camera is great for taking basic pictures.  I enjoy taking pictures of scenic views and using them as a screen saver, or just family and friends photos then creating an online album to share with everyone.  Pictures do print nicely as well, depending on the printer and paper (especially when using the Kodak printer dock).  I have occasionally had blurry pictures, but I'm not sure if that is the camera or my nerves.  It does have a sport setting for objects in motion, so when not taking scenery pictures, I use that a lot.  I definitely recommend this camera to anyone who likes to take pictures but has a smaller budget.<br /><br />EDIT:  After about four years, at least two of which did not include as much picture taking as the first year, I finally had to buy a new camera.  This Kodak started giving me trouble by either refusing to turn on or by shutting itself off at random (was not the batteries, because I replaced them multiple times).  It was a good camera back when I bought it, I was just a little disappointed in how long it lasted.  I now have a Canon PowerShot A3100IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Blue) since I couldn't get another Kodak (and it was only $100 in 2009 at Ultimate Electronics (now bankrupt)).  While the colors in pictures are not as vibrant as those taken with the Kodak, the Canon has a faster shutter speed and I have far less blurry pictures since technology had greatly improved over those four years.  I would have bought another Kodak if I could have, however I needed one quickly and the local store did not have ANY Kodak cameras, and, unless something drastically changes for Kodak, no one ever will (plus the EasyShare software is no longer supported or available for download).","You know, The camera is only 3.1 mega pixels, has pretty much basic features, and is just a point and shoot type camera... but.... this camera is great.<br /><br />This was my first digital camera. It took fabulous pictures. Please note that on occassion, I would take a picture and it would look like someone smeered vaseline on the picture, but I found that turning the camera off than back on again solved the problem.<br /><br />Many pictures have been blown up and are on my wall. This is a great camera for up to 10x12's. I had no problems for these sizes at all.<br /><br />It doesn't take the greatest pictures in near dark low light conditions, I'd say that 6 out of 10 of my dark shots turned out with low noise.<br /><br />I really love this camera and use it to this very day. When this camera was a little over a year old, I purchased a nikon 8700 and one year later, the nikon...which was taken great care of, is rendered useless. This know almost 3 year old camera is still tiking away producing great photos. Even after heavy heavy abuse... This thing is solid!!!<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Fabulous beginner point and shoot camera with easy to use basic menues. Great short clip video capabilities. Clear Crisp pictures and awesome color. Very close to actual color. Sufficient resolution for fabulous pictures... I will post some of my pictures in a few days.... This camera is mega awesome... durable... and reliable............ Wish they made higher end cameras as well..........<br /><br />I rated a 4 out of 5 due to the very occasional blurred/smeared problem that happened only about once every 300 pictures, and the fact that the lowlight capabilities are a little... just a little disappointed.. over all I highly recommend!!!!! If I could give 4 and 3/4 stars that is what I would rank this camera as, but I can't so it gets a 4/5.....","I have this camera and love it! I was opposed to going digital as a photo buff for the past 30 years. I bought it to get some pix for on-line auctioning- now I use it all the time. The video feature is also handy (not great quality, but it captures the moment), especially when you can only bring a camera into a concert. The price is exceptionally good for this product and I would highly recommend it for the digital beginner or someone who just wants a small camera.<br /><br />11/28/2007: Just for the record, when I purchased this camera, I paid less than $100.00 for it. I have since purchased the Kodak Z712IS and can honestly say, it does not compare as far as the clarity of the photos. It has a higher megapixel and a 12x zoom, but I cannot get the shots I did with this camera. I'm glad I didn't sell it.","This camera was given to my sister as a gift.  She indicated to me that the box had been opened, but the contents were intact and the package was complete.  Seller indicated that this was an open box item.  I reviewed the advertisement posted on Amazon.  No \"open box\" indication was stated.  It may be true that the seller's website made the open box statement.  I have no way of knowing that other than the seller's statement. It would be nice if Amazon could document the status of purchased goods that are advertised on the website but available off-site.  The camera appears to be working fine.","I bought one of these cameras for my son when his daughter was born.  Since they enjoyed this camera and the pictures came out great, I decided it was time for grammy to get one as well.  A great deal for the price.","i've bought this camera for my girlfriend and my mother and they both like it. it's really easy to use and the picture quality is great. don't believe anyone who tells you you need more than 3 megapixels. and this one has a real optical zoom, not just that b.s. digital zoom that a lot of the less expensive dig cams have. you definitely need a memory card though, because the camera itself only holds about 15 pictures.","Incase anyone wanted to know, the camera comes with Kodak Software for the Mac, but if your using OS X with iPhoto, it will detect the camera, import the photos and allow you to edit, print and email as usual. Currently using Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger) with iLife '05 but i expect it will work fine with iLife 04 as well. Picture quality is very good, easy to use. Not much else to be said that hasn't already been said. Hope this helps.","I love this camera! It's inexpensive, takes good pictures, and has great battery life. And I love the video feature! I did wish it came with more memory, though. But I guess all digital cameras only come with 16MB.<br /><br />The camera is very easy to use. I haven't had any problems with it yet!","I bought two of these after checking out lots of reviews and have been very happy with them until recently when the battery doors on broke on both of them (after only 3 months!) The only way to keep it closed is with a rubber band around the whole camera. Nice pictures, but VERY disapointed in the quality.","OK guys -- this is a great camera, definately good bang for the buck.... all these features for less than $150 is amazing - i love this camera and researched over 100 others..this is the winner!

He hikes constantly, and is in the local Allegheny Search and Rescue group, as well as Scoutmaster. So he needs a camera with him that can go on his belt and take pictures that can automatically be referred to. I bought him this camera a couple of years ago, and it has proven to be an excellent buy. Not only does it take fairly good pictures, but it is easy to use, and is lightweight enough to carry on his belt. When clambering down mountains looking for idiot Scouts who fell because they went where they were not supposed to go, he needs something lightweight. It also allows those professionals to see original pictures of how people landed, and where they were, so they can accurately treat them. My husband still wants the more expensive Nikon, but that will be for his own nature photography.<br /><br />Good buy...<br /><br />Karen Sadler","For several years while other major camera companies were peddling their digital cameras, Kodak stayed out of the picture.  (No Pun Intended) However, when Kodak saw the possibilities their company exploded creating some of the most awesome digital photography equipment on the planet.<br /><br />One such camera is Kodak EasyShare Model CX 7330.  Not much to say except buy it.  Sharp pictures, Easy and quick download to your computer, fantastic prints, Exquisite Website pictures and much more.<br /><br />I purchased mine after returning the HP model without the optical zoom.  Compared to that one, Kodak's Easy Share 7330 makes HPs look like an old Brownie.<br /><br />On a personal note, I use my camera to take pictures of every day appliances, such as tables, refrigerators, etc; things we take for granted.  I share these pictures with my \"Autistic\" students in order to teach these wonderful jids basic everyday life skills.<br /><br />KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK KODAK<br /><br />Steve Horwitz<br /><br />Teacher - Autistic Children","I find this camera very easy to use. It takes really nice pictures and is small enough to fit in my purse.  Only problem is it is not made well.  The battery door no longer cleses on it's own, I have to tape it and the zoom button has fallen off for the 2nd time, 1st time I found it and put it back on, this time I wasn't as lucky.  I think a camera should hold up better than this after only one year of use.","its really nice camera i had one before and i bought second one","i got this camera for my birthday with the printer dock and i absolutely love them both.  they were so easy to use and the pictures come out great.  i looove it soooooo much!","This is the second digital camera i have owned, but so much easier to use.  Takes clear pictures -- I like intuitive elements on the switches -- and the movies with sounds are a lovely feature.  Often, the subject has no idea you could be recording a short little flick!<br /><br />Downloading is easy with the included software.  Software also allows easy editing and cropping.<br /><br />I would recommend this to the user who wants to take pictures and not waste a lot of time with learning how to use the camera.","My sister got one for me and one for my dad for Christmas and it's so easy that even my dad figured it out!","This is a great item.  Very easy to use and very efficient.  Even if you are not technical all you need to do is follow the simple instructions and you can print pics, download to your computer, email pics, record short videos with sound and a bunch of other things.  I even downloaded a picture and emailed it to an online store to print the picture on a purse and T shirt for a gift.<br /><br />BUT, be patient with the printing off the dock.  It's slow and the printer cartridge lasts for 40 pics and that's it.  You only have one choice of paper and cartridge pack so don't buy all the other fancy papers because the printer cartridge is only sold as a package that includes 40 sheets of Kodak paper for $25.<br /><br />The camera didn't come with a carrying case and you definetly need one so the camera doesn;t get scratched, etc.  I bought one at a retailer for $10.<br /><br />Then I had to buy a memory card otherwise the camera itself only hold 10 pictures.  I think with the memory card (that slips into the side of the camera) I get about 100 pics.  That was about $40.  I also got that at a retailer.<br /><br />One more thing...don't count on your retailer to have the Kodak assessories readily available.  I originally went to Best Buy and Frys and they were out of the things I needed.  So I bought on line at Kodak.com.<br /><br />Also, the battery is rechargeable on the dock so don't throw it out or recycle it because you can recharge it and use it over and over.  The dock charges it in about 3 hrs.","This is the second digital camera I have owned . The thing I like about the CX7330 is that it is extremely lightweight, easy on batteries, takes sharp prints,and most of all , easy to understand and simple to use and it has a optical zoom which is much better than the digital zoom.<br /><br />The main problem I have right now is that my Computer which is a Windows 98 will not download the software.That is not the software's fault because my computer is 4 systems back so I need a new computer which I have ordered. I'm a little behind on modern technology and I have looked at a lot of cameras and this is by far the easiest to use. Also be sure to buy a good memory card with this camera .I bought the Sandisk 256 MB which will store 271 prints on high resolution.","I take a lot of pictures, but didn't want to spend a lot of money on a new digital....don't want to worry about it being lost or stolen.  I bought this camera because it had gotten really great reviews from other users but was still really inexpensive.  Maybe users who need a whole lot of features or manual controls wouldn't be happy with it, but the pictures I've taken so far have been excellent.<br /><br />This camera is also very easy to use--nice, simple zoom feature that gets good closeups without having to be right in someone's face.  I agree with other reviewers that the door where you insert the memory card seems VERY fragile, but otherwise it's pretty sturdy and compact.<br /><br />I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a better array of features and such good crisp pictures in other cameras in this price range.  If I like it as much as I think I'm going to, I'm also going to spring for the matched printer dock so I can print some of these nice photos. I checked it out too (so you don't have to) and it got equally good reviews across the board.","I'm not a big photographer, but I wanted a camera I could use to take pictures of the work going on at my house. This was a perfect choice. It did what I expected it to do, right out of the box. The cable was simple to figure out (don't know why anyone would need the docking station), and the very first time I hooked it in to my computer and turned it on, there were my pictures ready to edit and arrange.<br /><br />I bought a 256m chip, and it holds all the pictures I've ever wanted to take. It took FOREVER (at least 250 photos, many with flash) for the first set of batteries to wear out. I'm on the second set now, and they've been plugging along for 125-150 photos.<br /><br />Cons: (a) I'd love more of a zoom range, but I guess this is standard for a less expensive camera like this. (b) The door to the port feels like a tinkertoy, but I've just been very careful with it and so far it's holding up fine. (c) The little squigglies on the top dial aren't easy to figure out, but I'm not sure you need to use them anyway.<br /><br />Good little camera for simple straightforward photography.","i have had this camera for a while now, and surprisingly i have XP and it works just fine, my brother has XP and he also has one of these cameras and his works fine - i love the options and i love the zoom - the video is short and sweet, but its a camera not a video recorder - the video's / pictures email really easily, and printing is great - nice quality and you also have a option of \"fun effects\" once you take the pictures and go into the albums in your computer - (software was pie - not hard to install at all) you can make your pictures look like cartoons, antique, black and white, fisheye, and even give them a \"coloring book\" effect- very cool stuff - also you can set your control panel to elect your Kodak Albums as your screen saver, and the program randomly selects which pictures to view, so it flips between every photo you have ever taken, and your screen saver is now a slide show!! its great, and for the price, its twice as nice!","This was my first digital camera and I could not be any happier!  It is so easy to use and the software is great.  I would not change one thing about it.  Be sure to get a memory card and extra batteries though.  The pictures turn out perfect.  I would recommend this camera to anyone!","I just bought this camera and I am VERY happy with it. I was considering the Fuji A210, but the time between pictures was so slow and the image quality was bad. I looked at this one because a friend said to and it's the best one I've looked at in this price range (under $200). You can't beat 3.1MP AND optical zoom. I've taken a few pictures, the batteries that came with the camera are still fine. I did get rechargable though lol. The camera works if you don't have a ton of light, but I still reccomend a pretty well lit area, as any camera you get will need light. As for the user a few reviews down, I have Windows XP and the software works perfect with it, as does the camera. The ONLY complaint I have is the memory is internal so you have to buy a new memory card ($8 at Wal Mart). That's not bad though, considering I can now take 33 pictures.","For most people, 3 megapixels is all you need. And while I wouldn't have chosen the Kodak CX7330 for myself, my wife bought it for me to replace our old 3-megapixel Konica, and it's quite a capable little machine. Despite extensive photography experience for over 20 years, I'm surprised how much more I use it because I don't have to make so many decisions about the pictures I take.<br /><br />The CX7330 takes great snapshots, just don't expect much manual control over them. Whether this is the camera for you depends on whether you want that control (in which case you should pick another model), or just want to take decent photos (in which case this one is quite good).<br /><br />The camera body is not especially small and all plastic, but (other than the memory card door) feels solid and is comfortable to hold. The controls are very straightforward: choose one of five photo modes, or one movie mode, then press a button to shoot. Since the camera has a good lens and intelligent electronics, the results are generally very good, with much better auto-white balance than on many other comparable cameras. For novices or those who don't have or don't want to use a computer to process their photos, the Share button and available dock and printer could be handy, though they're not for me.<br /><br />Low-light performance without a flash isn't so great. There is no way to force long exposures, the camera lacks an auto-focus assist lamp like Canon models have, and the lens is a bit slow. Startup and shot-to-shot times are decent, but not all that fast, and fairly typical of this class of camera. Battery life, using either NiMH rechargeables or the included lithium expendables, is fabulous, the best I've ever seen from a digicam using just two AA batteries -- and a huge improvement over many other battery-eating models.<br /><br />The only control you have over the camera is to choose the shooting mode, set how the flash behaves (auto, forced on, forced off, or red-eye reduction), decide on a resolution (you have no control over how much compression the camera uses, just photo size), and set the self-timer or nice 3-shot burst mode if you want. You can adjust the exposure compensation to take longer or shorter exposures, but there's no way to set the shutter speed, focus, or f-stop directly.<br /><br />One useful option is a 3-megapixel 3:2 ratio size, which makes shots that fit on the longer 4x6\" prints from most photo stores, without needing to be cropped. The movie mode (if you're into that) is quite good for this sort of camera: 320x240 pixels with sound, 15 frames per second, with no limit on time other than the size and speed of your memory card. There is also a neat onscreen display of little \"brackets\" showing where the camera is focusing, though there is no way to change that other than to recompose your photo.<br /><br />A few other quirks: Other than the image size, most other parameters (like flash mode) reset themselves when you turn the camera off and on. You can choose either to use the internal 16 MB memory OR an SD/MMC memory card (if present), but not both, i.e. there's no easy way to use an external card until it fills up, then switch to the internal memory automatically. You must make the switch using a menu, or remove your memory card. Finally, while the optical (lens-moving) zoom works all the time, the digital zoom (always a misomer; it's really \"in-camera cropping\") only operates if you have the LCD screen turned on.<br /><br />So this is not a camera for serious pro or \"prosumer\" photography, but for carrying around all the time as a family snapshot camera, or as a backup when you just need to get the picture, it does the job well. And for the price, it's quite a deal.","I bought this camera on sale a got a $30 gift card so I am happy. The video and sound quality is unbelievably high quality.  The software is very easy to use.  I was amazed how easy it was to remove red eye from previous pictures taken from my fugi film camera. I have not experienced red eye with this camera, but if I do the software will remove it very easily.  The body looks cheap but it feels sturdy when you hold it.  It has so many features that come in higher priced cameras, the bang for the buck is what counts for me.  Cons I don't like the USB under the flemsy plastic flap. This same flap conceals the a/v out and SD card. The less I have to open that flimsy plastic flap the better.  Other than that all is good to go.  I would definitely recommend this camera to family and friends.","My girlfriend has this camera.  The software CD works well with both Windows 2000 and Windows XP.  Don't understand why the other reviewer say that it's not compatible.  Even if there is this problem, one can always goto [...] and download the latest software.<br /><br />Uploading pictures is easy.  Connect the USB cable that comes with the camera to the computer, then turn on the camera, the Kodak software automatically detects the photo transfer in a few seconds.  Then, you just press \"transfer all\", it transfers all pictures right away.<br /><br />Emailing picture is easy.  Press email button, enter \"from\" your email address; enter \"to\" destination email address, then choose the pictures from right side and click \"send\".  That's it!  It is so simple.  Of course, be sure you are online when you do this.<br /><br />The picture quality is pretty good, better than a comparable SONY, which is even costier.  I myself use the DX7440, which is a higher-end Kodak 4.0MP with full TV-quality movie mode.  We upload pictures to Ofoto.com and print 4\"X6\", 8\"X10\" pictures.  The colors are true, natural and not over-satuated.<br /><br />I compare the photos taken from this to my DX7440, there is no difference for 4\"X6\" at least.  My DX7440 does take photos in dark better since there are manual features for that purpose and the DX7440 is more expensive.<br /><br />The movie mode is a nice extra since sometimes you really want to take some short movies and capture the moments you like to capture in motion.<br /><br />I have two Kodak digital cameras and my girlfriends and some of our friends all use Kodak digital cameras.  As long as it is manufactured after 1/1/2004, the cameras are fine since there is the extra of new Kodak color-science enhancement for the new cameras manufactured in 2004.<br /><br />The Zoom len also works great.  Taking close shots requires pressing a close-shot button otherwise it won't focus properly, just have to remember that.<br /><br />This camera also works well with Kodak printer dock, the prints are laminated, and it makes the photos free from moisture attack and finger prints.  Nice!<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one great camera.  Yet, for those who like to take better night shots and more movie features, get the LS743 or DX7440 or CX7530 or CX7430.  These cameras comes with TV-quality movie features.","The camera was great and very easy to use, however it is not compatible with Windows XP.  We called Kodak and they were unable to help us.  Hopefully they will come out with a patch to help this out but in the meantime, mine was returned.<br />As I said before, apparently they have come out with a patch for Windows XP but at the time I had mine, Kodak told us it was not compatible with XP.","This is a really great camera; I've had mine for about half a year now, and it has proven to be durable and high-quality.  The batteries run out pretty fast, but all digital cameras tend to be quite battery-greedy.  Note: use the viewfinder instead of turning on the camera screen to save batteries.  This is the perfect, affordable camera for first-time digital camera users!","This was my first digital camera purchase and I could not have chosen a better buy. I have only had this camera two days and I already know how to work every feature. It comes with everything you need to get started. This camera is very functional with flash options, a zoom feature, self-timer (allowing you to get in the picture), 5 picture-taking settings and a video mode. I would suggest buying an SD (Secure Digital) card and extra batteries to get more pictures from your camera.","after a long wait and reviewing many cameras I opted for this one and pretty much took it home opened it and started taking pictures.  Attended a wedding that weekend and couldn't use it enough playing with the video snapping pictures.  Print perfectly and easy to use, doesn't take much.  Great carry along size also, but do need the extra storage card to hold more pictures."]},{"name":"Kodak EasyShare CX7530","amazon_reviews":["I have loved this camera for years before I dropped and broke mine.

I bought it at Staples and liked it very much. It was very easy to use it and I took lots of great pics with this camera during different vacations in Florida, Hawaii, etc. But, unfortunately, I lost it. Therefore, I decided to buy another Kodak Easyshare CX7530 5 MP Digital Camera with 3xOptical Zoom from Amazon.com in June 2008. It was sold by: kolleridy_electronics. I have different digital cameras now - Panasonic, Nikon. But, I continue to use my Kodak Easyshare camera, too. Thought, Kodak camera has low resolution of pic 5.0 Mpx, pics taken with Kodak Easyshare CX7530 5 MP Digital camera most of the time are better than pics taken with cameras with higher resolution...like 6.0 Mpx, 8.0 Mpx. Kodak Easyshare is still a nice digital camera!","A \"straightforward, no-nonsense\" camera for old-schoolers who find a viewfinder WAY more usable than a dinky screen that needs the highest power bifocals you can buy to use it.  Good resolution, great optics, and versatile as well. If action shots are your forte, this camera is everything it should be, with the ability to control flash and exposure, zoom, as well as wide-angle (sort of).<br />Economical, as well as convenient. A great little camera to carry all the time.","This is my second purchase of this camera.  My old one started using up batteries very fast.  For the casual photographer this camera has just the right balance of ease of use plus features and options for the advanced user.  I use it for everything from close ups to landscapes.  My all time favorite camera.","Got this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it and feels so grown-up now that she is able to take pictures just like the adults!","It take great pics have used it for 2 vacations already and kids performaces.  No complaints about this product at all.","The Kodak Easyshare is, by modern standards, a bit of a brick, but it does fit in a shirt pocket for easy carry and it takes sharp, clear pictures.<br />The optical viewfinder allows the use of the full zoom with the confidence that you're pointing the camera toward the subject. Sadly, modern view screens can be easily obscured by glare and are nearly unusable in full daylight.","This camera was my stepping stone into digital photography.<br /><br />Having been devoted to my Canon EOS Elan II, the EasyShare was something to play with while I learned digital, and to help me decide if I wanted to jump in to digital photography with both feet, or simply have the added option.<br /><br />This camera takes good pictures overall, though I have to admit, I've never been that impressed with the landscape shots. It does take fantastic close-ups, and since I shoot a lot of floral photography it was right up my alley. For most photography situations it works great.<br /><br />I've since graduated to a Canon EOS digital, but I keep the Kodak in my purse so I'm always camera ready.<br /><br />My one true complaint is that the viewer has become dust ridden. I've taken exceptional care of this camera so am not sure how so much dust managed to get into the LCD display. It's just something I wouldn't have expected to be an issue.<br /><br />As for batteries...It does speed through them at a fairly alarming rate, but not as quickly as I've heard other cameras of the same style do. I can actually take quite a few pictures (and more than I expected) with one set of batteries.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend this camera for anyone trying to decide if digital is what they want to do for the long haul.","Purchased this camera after reading about on Consumer Reports and doing a bit of comparison shopping. Although it is a bit bulky compared to other cameras, it has been reliable (and I have dropped it a few times). Pictures are clear and consise, the screen is perfect size.<br />My only complaint is that the space for hand to hold camera on left side is a bit too small. Other than that! Good purchase.","I'm a thunderstorm enthusiast, so I've been using this to take photos of clouds and video of lightning storms.  While it's definitely not professional quality, it's great for a hobbyist.<br /><br />Don't bother with the digital zoom, though, honestly.  It makes pictures far too grainy.","The 7530 works fine. Like some other reviewers, battery life is very short. I've tried rechargeable NI-MH cells rated 2200 mAh each. These did not last more than a day or two. The camera seems to drain them even when not in use. This happened with AA Lithium cells also. These fresh cells lasted 2 or 3 days and were then dead.<br />  This camera has been around and has many reviews. This seems a common problem. I wonder if it is common to all digital cameras?<br />  Aside from this the camera is easy to use. It does take a very good picture.<br />  When I use the camera I turn off the image display, and there are no \"dirty\" contacts. I can not get over how it goes through batteries.<br />  It is bad enough to make me miss my old SLR film camera. I wanted rechargable lithiums but they are limited and may not be much better. Oh well.","If you have a limited budget this is a good camera, the batteries run out fast and if you don't mind pressing the shutter button and the picture finally snaps  which seems like 2 seconds later-this is for you. I thought this lag time  wouldn't be a  big deal until I used it, it became a huge annoyance and a big drawback for enjoying using  this camera.","The pictures it takes are fine; my main complaints are that this camera has a slow shutter speed, it takes a long time to reset itself when I'm trying to shoot a number of pictures at once AND this camera uses up a lot of battery power (especially when transferring over photos).  I wish it came with a rechargeable battery instead of requiring AA batteries.","After more than a couple of years of use and a few drops and dings this camera still works and produces good quality pictures.<br /><br />I had to replace the rechargeable NiCad battery pack a few months ago.  I was expecting a little more mileage out of the batteries since I am very good are keeping the camera in the dock for recharging.<br /><br />Camera is easy to use and with enough memory you can capture several short video clips.  That feature is also easy to figure out.  I have 512 MB of memory which allowed me at last count to store nearly 400 pictures and 2 video clips about 30 seconds long.<br /><br />I wish I could say my next camera would be another Kodak, were is not for the fact I had a very dissapointing experience with the Printer Dock hardware and software.<br /><br />On the plus side, this camera is detected properly on SuSE Linux Desktop 10 and works well with F-Spot and digiKam when connected through USB port.<br /><br />Overall it is a good buy and you will not be dissapointed.","I love this camera!  It is so easy to use and easy to learn the features of it.","I've had this camera for 2 years now. My wife dropped it and cracked the LCD, though it still works. But I thought maybe it might be time to buy a new camera so I started looking.<br /><br />You know what? I can't find a new point & shoot camera that produces images that is convincingly better with such ease of use. Bummer! After 2 years, other than just an increase in MP, overall image quality has not gotten any better! We went to Japan and my wife bought a Ricoh R4 for nearly $450 and after comparing photos, my 7530 was still better.<br /><br />After doing more research and comparing photos of the new Canons (SD600, 700, 800), Casios and other Kodaks, there aren't any new compact models that is convincing me. I don't want a Sony or Fuji due to their proprietary memory cards, and the Nikon compacts are not rated very well.<br /><br />For now, I've decided to keep my 7530 with the cracked LCD and all because in the end, image quality beats all those bells and whistles.","I ran down this item description because I wanted to compare this 7530 to the newer 7MP-10MP super-compacts out there for size.  Noticed the ratings, and had to jump in for a few words.<br /><br />I bought this about 1 1/2 yrs ago to take pics for work, both indoors and out.  Used about 5-10 times / month, 20-200 pics per mo.  The pics I've gotten with its \"pipsqueak\" 5MP have produced the best photos so far from among my co-workers cameras, some as high as 8MP (and they all agree, unanimously).  Very bright pics outdoors, good indoors as long as you are within flash range (perhaps 10'-12' max where its real dark).<br /><br />Granted it is moderately \"bulky\" compared to the newer super-compacts and is a bit of a squeeze fitted into your typical shirt pocket, but at the current price ($150 or so I see, as of 1/12/07) its a \"fair\" price and ideal for someone who wants a quality semi-bargain snap and shoot that is relatively easy to learn, even now.  Just know that I've only used it for 4x6's (with an HP 375 battery-powered mini-printer in the field) and a few 8x10's.<br /><br />It is a tad slow to power up, and getting the red \"not ready\" (mostly because of flash settings I've messed with) light to stop takes a moment of patience.  This is all that is even slightly negative that I can say about it.  The controls aren't cumbersome, the menus are good (not great, but good for what it does), the battery lasts a long time (and ,nicely, will take AA's in a pinch, its most endearing feature for me at work where I may not have a charger, although I may only get another 20-30 pics with flash from standard AA's), and since its pictbridge compatible I just plug it into the printer or computer and go, everytime.<br /><br />It has done all I've asked of it, and have certainly got my money's worth (I recall I paid about $200-225 or so).  If you aren't going to go and spend $225 & up within the next year for another camera (say a Canon SD600 or 630 or comparable, at that price range, both of which are smaller and take good pics), this is all you'll need.","This is a good camera than can create fantastic pictures.  The only problem I have found it that it takes a quite a while between pictures to get ready for the next one.  Wonderful camera for still pictures every once in a while.  Poor camera for lots of pictures really quick.","I have had this camera for a couple years.  I bought this camera for $300.  I have LOTS to say about the camera!<br /><br />The thing that stands out about this camera is that it is SO easy to use!  All the features that it has are really easy to get to.  The image quality is good, and you can change the size of your pictures very easily in a very undestandable way (small, med, large)... many people don't understand what pixels are (I sure didn't before!).<br /><br />The internal memory is also great!  You can take pictures on those moments when you realize you forgot your memory card at home!! (I hate when that happens!)  The black and white pictures look awesome and the sepia mode makes a very beautiful brown shade.  The video mode is good and the built in speaker is awesome for watching your videos right there.<br /><br />There is one complaint I have about this camera.  Sometimes indoors, the flash isn't very good.  The backgrounds come out very dark.  But with some editing on the computer, you should be able to fix that!<br /><br />But the most incredible thing about this camera is it's durability. Man, has my camera gone through alot!  It's been thrown 15 feet in the air, left outside on a rainy night, dropped in the toilet, dropped in the sand at the beach, dropped really hard by little kids... it's just been abused in any way you can think.  And amazingly... it still works.  Don't ask me how, but it does!  I've never repaired it or anything.  I do have to put tape on the battery door and it shuts off sometimes (not often at all, though), but I can deal with that!<br /><br />If I went back in time, I'd buy it again. :)","I bought this camera in mid-2004 when it was the latest thing. Nowadays, when 7.0+MP cameras are everywhere at exactly the same price I got it($305.00), I wouldn't change it for anything. It's easy to configure, and the pictures looks great as digital images and printed. I used it mostly to take pictures of band shows, where people moves often under dark places, and pics were always luminous, crisp and expresive. And not to mention outdoor pictures, I did lots of internal touring around the island and pictures couldn't look any better...!<br /><br />So sad I lost my beloved camera a few weeks ago, I'll be missing it lots. But then again, perhaps it's time to upgrade so I think I'll go with a Z650 Easyshare since I had such a great time with its predecesor...","I got this camera around two months ago and it is great, except for one flaw. There is something wrong with the flash, it is programmed to be on but there is no flash ever. It ruins the whole picture usually. I need help, or I might as well throw this camera away.","I've had this camera for a little over 8 months now and i love it!! So far, I have had no problems with it. It is an excellent bargain for price, quality and the various functions. It takes great pics both indoors and outdoors. It also takes decent videos. Battery power lasts long with the Kodak cx7530. I highly recommend it!","This is my second point and shoot digital camera.  Nothing was wrong with my other it just took a rocket scientist to use it.  Not with the Kodak CX7530.  You can basically turn it on and figure all the buttons easily.  I love the screen descriptions when you turn the top dial to see what mode you are in.  Daytime shots come out great!  Night time are not so great as the flash doesn't carry but that is the case with most digital cameras.  I would buy this camera again in an instant!  Update.  I've had this camera for over 2 years and am now having trouble with it not turning on all the time.  If I remove and put the batteries back in it usually fixes the problem.  I'm also having trouble with the flash...","The Kodak Easyshare cx7530 is a 5.0 MP Digital Camera<br /><br />I am new to digital camera but I have found this extremely easy to use at regular day use. The video and sound are clear and easy to use but I would recommend a tripod. This uses 2 AA Batteries if you can get some rechargeable batteries it well help a lot it has a 32 mb of internal memory but get an extra sd card of at least 256 mb<br /><br />This camera is awesome and I highly recommend it to you if you are considering a new camera or a upgrade!","I purchased my Kodak CX7530 7 months ago and have taken hundreds of pictures.  Every picture has came out perfect with rich, vibrant color.  I cannot find one complaint about this camera or the software, they both are extremely easy to use and produce excellent results!  I recommend purchasing a 256 MB SD card...you'll be suprised how many pictures you will take!!  I use rechargeable batteries (Kodak recommends NOT using regular  AA batteries) and am very impressed with how long they last...even using the LCD display.  I keep my camera with me at all times...that way, I never miss a \"Kodak moment\"!","Best\"bang for the buck\" I have ever purchased. At a company picnic there were several people taking pictures. Some had very expensive cameras. My pictures were just as good! I am not a good photographer, but the camera and the software made me look like one. THANKS KODAK FOR A GRRRRRRRRREAT CAMERA","This is the first time I bought a digital camera. I am still testing this camera using various modes and lights and I am pleased with it. Quite a few people complained about the software, well I guess there is some problem with the software, but I did not bother to use their software. I just use Picasa2 from Google it is much easier to use and cool software.<br /><br />The only draw back I guess is the battery drain.<br /><br />It is a must to buy some really good rechargable batteries. And some SD memeory too.","I purchased this camera along with the printer dock and it is awesome. It produces BETTER pictures than a very expensive 35mm camera professionally developed. It's a MUST HAVE. It's so simple to use, a child could use it and get perfect pictures. I cannot tell you how much I LOVE IT !","I had bought this camera for my husband as a birhtday gift. He is what you could call a shutter bug. :) He absolutely loves it and so do I. It is very easy to use even for those that are not real good with electronics or technical gizmos. While we prefer to use our own picture software already installed on our computer, it is extremely easy to download our pictures to send out as email.","I sought out this camera at the suggestion of a friend.  The quality of the camera and the quality of the pictures are excellent.  The EasyShare software is giving me a problem for some reason.  Tech support has been attentive but the problem of not installing continues.","I purchased this camera as I had a couple of very poor quality cameras and was tired of their shortcomings<br /><br />I think this camera is great to use, a breeze to work out and install and the online and provided tutorials make what you can't work out just as straight forward.<br /><br />The photos I've taken so far have been nothing short of awesome and friends I've shown are equally impressed.<br /><br />Love it!","I JUST BAUGHT THIS IN RADIO SHACK YESTERDAY AND UP TILL NOW ITS THE BEST PERFECT SIZ FOR THE SCREEN AND THE RESOLUTION IS THE BEST THIS IS DEFANATELY ONE OF KODAK'S BEST PRODUCTS YET PLEAS CONSIDER.","This is an excellent camera, the quality of the pictures are crystal clear, the video recordings sound quality is excellent it picks up everything, even when its a noisy atmosphere, not to mention the video record quality is pretty good. This is my second Kodak camera and I like this one far better, at first I had the 3.0 MP camera, but I returned it for this one, and I'm happy that I made that decision. May I also recommend that you download the new Kodak Easyshare software from the Kodak site, its a newer version 5.0 I believe its a little bit better than the software that it comes with. You're able to add music to your videos, and its easier to use.","I'm not one to write a review, in fact this is my very first. I bought this camera based on all the great reviews I read before my purchase in February 2005.<br /><br />The price is great and the size is nice, but it takes a lot of underexposed photos. Not to mention the RED EYES!<br /><br />I'm a tad disappointed. My first digital camera (Kodak DC3400 2MP) took wonderful pictures as compared to this camera. The only drawback was the size. It was kind of big and bulky. I sure wish I didn't give that camera away.<br /><br />Summary...was a lot happier with my Kodak DC3400. Wish I still had it and regret buying this Kodak CX7530. I'm in search of another digital camera...again.","Kodak is my second digital camera, my first was Sony 3.2 MP.. I thought that Kodak has done a great job with this camera. The one thing that I was kind of upset is that you must know how to operate the camera in order to get clear picture such as you must make sure that the squares change to green before you take your picture so that it focus properly. I've already get the hang of this but occassionally I got blur pictures and this is very frustrating. Furthermore, if you gonna ask someone to take your pictures, you have to explain to them how to go about doing it so that they won't take blur pictures. These happens to me when I went for a trip overseas and a few of my pictures are either blur or under exposed and I could not even fix them.<br /><br />So to all who wanna buy Kodak digital camera make sure that you know how to operate them so that your picture won't be blur, or underexposed. Other than that, I like the compactness of this camera but am still looking for the ease of using digital camera.. Perhaps I should stick to either Sony or Canon.","I purchased this camera after reading the perfect product reviews on nearly every website I researched. However, my experience was very different and disappointing compared to others.  I am a professional graphic designer and have experience with professional photography as well. I wanted a good inexpensive digital camera that would exceed the quality and resolution of my $800 4 megapixal digital camera.  I purchased the Kodak EasyShare CX7530, so I would have it before my sister's wedding.  I tested it around the house for a couple of days and made the following observation.  Photos that were taken outside in natural sunlight turned out absolutely perfect.  I could see extremely detailed aspects of my photo subjects that could not be seen when taken with a 4mp camera. I took pictures of my dog and could literally see every single strand of hair on her in all the photos.  Outside photos are absolutely amazing. HOWEVER, the photos I took indoors (using lighting from lamps and/or overhead lights) did not turn out as well. The overall color of my photo subjects seems to be rather subdued and the color was not accurate.  The details that I saw in outdoor photos weren't as prominate when the same subjects were photographed indoors.  Nevertheless, I still felt that it had potential, and I took it to my sister's wedding anyway.<br /><br />I took approximately 90 photos at the wedding, and nothing could have prepared me for how terrible the photos would turn out. The chapel had natural sunlight coming through the windows providing enough lighting so that the flash was not automatically used. All of the photos were taken using the \"Auto\" setting. I was sitting in the front row so I wouldn't be too far away from my subjects. While the photos appeared to be normal through the viewer window, I was shocked when I got home and transferred them to my computer.  Every single photograph taken in the chapel was absolutely ruined.  They all had a bright red tint to them that could not be corrected, and they were all severely distorted and blurred.  I only used the zoom in a couple of photos, and those photos were completely unrecognizable.  But the majority of photos were taken without zoom, in good lighting, close to my photo subjects..... and none of them are usable and worthy of being printed. The ONLY photos that turned out decent were the few I took outdoors during the wedding reception, which was held at 3pm sunlight and in perfect weather. I am shocked, disappointed, and angry.... words can't describe how I felt when this happened.  How can a camera that takes such perfect photos outside in the daytime take such horrific photos indoors?  I will never be able to replace the memories or photos I took that day, and I think everyone should be aware of the potential downside of this camera.  It definitely doesn't deserve a perfect rating.  I am a professional, and if I received such terrible results from a camera, I would caution anybody else who is looking for a dependable, easy point and click camera.  I returned this camera the second I got home from the wedding.<br /><br />As a side note, my aunt has the Kodak EasyShare DX7630 6.1 megapixal camera, which isn't much more expensive than this 5MP camera.  Almost all of her photos came out perfect and the detail is absolutely amazing indoors and outdoors.  I am going to purchase one just like hers.","After a recent trip to the mountains for a weekend getaway,  I decided it was time to purchase a \"wearable\" digital camera. I wanted something small enough to carry in a belt pouch (like you carry a cell phone) so I could keep it with me all the time.<br /><br />Also on my list of \"wants\" were the requirements that it: run on standard batteries (I now refuse to purchase electronic devices that require $50+ proprietary batteries); must be reasonably priced; must interface to my computer via a cable utilizing a USB port/plug (didn't want to be forced to use a docking station); be easy to operate; and of course, needs to be able to produce a nice looking picture.<br /><br />I've owned several digital camera's (Canon and Sony) over the past 6 or 7 years, so I've had some experience with both the good and bad aspects of digital photography.  After a fair amount of research (with an admitted bias toward Japanese name brands), I settled on the Kodak CX7530.  And I have been impressed.<br /><br />The photos are absolutely stunning.  The color saturation and clarity will amaze you.  I have yet to take the instruction manual out of the plastic wrap, yet I have managed to figure-out how to use most of the camera's features with just a little trial and error in a single afternoon.  Runs on 2 standard \"AA\" penlight batteries.  Sports more than average internal memory with the option of adding more storage capacity via removable cards (I purchased a 512MB SD card for about $40).  Computer software installation can be a bit aggravating, but once completed, picture transfers were simple, fast, and flawless.  And you can even shoot video clips that offer pretty credible quality.  Light  and small, slips into a small padded pouch on my belt so it is always handy.<br /><br />If you can get past your \"name tag\" bias, get you one of these little gems.  Kodak has put together a winner with the CX7530!!!!!","I'm not new to photography or digital cameras.  I've had them for a few years now.  This CX7530 is a fabulous camera.  You can just point and shoot or you can go into the menus and adjust the shutter speed and ISO and get some really creative shots.  I took mine to the Shedd Aquarium at night and put it on a tripod to capture the city (Chicago) from the lake.  I adjusted the shutter for a long exposure on 5 MP setting.  The resulting picture was breath taking.  We've had it professionally printed and it is now a wall mural.  It is that good.  Really sharp pictures even when laid down on very large paper stock.<br /><br />You can not go wrong with this camera, and I highly recommend the printer dock.  Once you get the camera and printer dock you will never go back to film.<br /><br />I've had the camera for about 9 months.","After about 1 year of research, I finally made the plunge and purchased a digital camera.  I finally decided on a Kodak after using my sister-in-law's older model.  After reviewing the different models, I decided that the CX7530 had the best bang for the buck, and shouldn't have me needing to buy a \"better\" camera for several years.  I have to give HUGE kudos to Kodak for absolute ease of use.  When we got this camera (yesterday) neither of us looked at the owner's manual.  We just started clicking away, using each of the settings.  Getting in and out of the menu, and picture review was so easy.  Uploading the pictures to the computer was also easy.  The software that came with the printer dock wouldn't install because of some conflict with XP.  But we have been using the Microsoft Camera Wizard which is basically idiot proof.  Our Dell computer has preloaded software, which we have been playing around with.  So far we have taken about 36 pictures, all in the \"best\" quality.  I am absolutely AMAZED at the crisp clarity of the photos this camera takes.  Scenery, pictures of people, animals, close ups of flowers, they are all amazing.  I think I am most impressed with the close up pictures.  I took a close up of a yellow dandelion, and the picture shows every detail in 3D.  I still can't get over the pictures!  We used Wal Marts online photo center to upload some of our picutres to see how they actually looked in print (they look STUNNING on the computer).  We got 2 4x6's, 4 5x7's, and 2 8x10's.  I was just as impressed with the prints.  The same colors, depth, and clarity was present.  We also used the movie mode to take a quick 30 second movie, using the internal memory.  The sound was good, and the picture better than I expected.  Things were a bit jerky when moving, but once focused, it was good.  Very impressive over all!  So, for those of you doing the research, ready to make the plunge into the world of digital cameras, or even looking to upgrade, you really need to look at this camera.  The ease, number of features, price, and quality of the photos make this an unbeatable bargain.","I purchased this camera about 3 months ago and couldn't be more pleased.  This is my first journey into the digital camera world and I had been researching this for about 2 weeks before I made my decision to go with this one.  The ease of use and the large viewing area was a must being that my 17 year old daughter loves to take pics and view immediately.  I will admit though, that I ditched the Kodak software almost immediately......it just didn't have enough features to keep my interest.  I have been using software called \"Picasa2\" by google, it's free, fun and very easy to use.  It has many features that we have enjoyed, and emailing them is a breeze.<br /><br />I have just recently bought a photo printer and with the 2 combined the quality is better than anything that you can take and get developed.  I never thought I would find a digital camera that I would find the quality as good as a 35mm, but I have and strongly recommend this one.","I've spent quite a bit of money on film cameras and lenses.  This was my first venture into the realm of digital photography.  I read a great deal before deciding on this camera and I have no regrets whatsoever.  This camera is fantastic.  Let's just go with a list:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- The pictures are absolutely OUTSTANDING especially considering this camera's price<br /><br />- This camera comes on almost instantly.<br /><br />- The battery life is great when using rechargables.  Another good thing about the batteries is that the camera takes standard AA's, so if you rechargables do run out at a bad time, you can always run and buy a pair of regular old alkaline AA's.<br /><br />- Although it's a minor feature, this camera actually takes half-way decent video and the sound is pretty good too.  Also, unlike other cameras, the length of your video is limited only by the size of your memory card.<br /><br />- The interface is very intuitive.  You hardly need to read the manual<br /><br />- Did I mention that the pictures were great?<br /><br />Con (very minor):<br /><br />- I wish this camera could go fully manual (changing the aperture and shutter speed).  However, you can usually trick the camera into doing what you want by changing the settings a little bit.<br /><br />Anyway, do your own research, but I think that you will find this camera to be an amazing value for the money.","I am very impressed with this unit. After driving to every Target store during Xmas to find this thing I eventually just bought it off Amazon and saved myself 20.00. I bought it for my wife as a gift. She was a bit weary about how well the printer would actually work. Last weekend I bought the printer and some paper and I have to say ... WOW! A one armed monkey could work this whole package. Great investment and well put together. Blows the HP / EPSON stuff away.","This is my second digital camera, and my second Kodak.  My first was the DC3400 dinosaur, and I was pretty pleased with that.  The DC3400 was limited compared to current technology, though, particularly in terms of resolution, size, and SPEED.  I was surprised how small this camera is, although it's not nearly as small as the super-compacts (which are a little too small for my taste, this one is about right).  I've heard complaints that the super small versions aren't very robust, but this medium-small version seems to be pretty durable.<br /><br />The camera is simple to operate, plug-n-plays nicely with XP, and seems to put out good pictures.  I particularly like the feature that allows you to take a series of stills rapidly by just holding down the shutter (very good for small children and animals that don't pose well!).<br /><br />With a 512M card, it has room for about 320 pictures at \"Best\" resolution.  Other features... cool sounds effects (plus the ability to TURN THEM OFF!), black and white, and sepia tone settings!  Very fun and will make great Xmas gifts (I hope).<br /><br />My only irritation so far... the navigation button is the 5 function on one button variety that can be hard to get to do what you want (the same type that has become common on cell phones, some PDAs, TV/DVD remotes, etc).  I'm sure it's an acquired skill, so I hope this won't be such an annoyance after a few uses.<br /><br />So far so good!  Great camera for a good price.","I really must say the picture quality ease of use and controls on this camera are first rate.  I really can not fault anything about the the camera.  I won't echo everything so many others have said about this fine camera surfice to say I agree fully with what was said.<br /><br />I draw one distinction however.  I gave this Camera four stars not five because the len's cap looks and functions as if it was designed by a two year old.  The Len's cap for this in all other ways superior camera is a abject disgrace to anything approaching quality engineering.  The Len's cover has less thought in its design than the lens cover you would find on the cheapest disposable 7 dollar box 35 mm camera's.<br /><br />For such an expensive camera the len's cap is just plain unforgivably cheap, not well secured to the camera body.  Even when properly affixed the connection between len's cap and camera body is almost non-existant.  The Len's cover pops off at the most inconvenient times and my being physically disabled it is a real dangerous chore for me to get safely on the floor to retrive it.<br /><br />I am happy Kodak came out with such a high grade camera.  I would not let the cheaply designed len's cap issue I raise here cheat you of the opportunity of owning this extremely fine camera.  I write about the flawed lens cap issue in hope the next digital camera Kodak produces invest's the same care to building a len's cap worth the awesome camera it protects.<br /><br />Thanks.  The Wolf of ALPHASPACE","I AM REALLY IMPRESSED WITH ALL THE FEATURES THIS CAMERA HAS & THE CLARITY OF THE PICTURES.. AFTER TRYING OUT MY NEW PHOTO PRINTER, I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURES.  I REALLY THINK IT'S A GOOD BUY EVENTHOUGH IT'S NOT THE SMALLEST CAMERA.. I SINCERELY RECOMMEND IT.","I love this camera, I got it about 2 weeks ago and I have taken tons of pictures with it.  It's so great because I can take a picture, put it on my computer and then zoom in and crop it and I have an even closer up picture.  The video is also really fun.  I took it to a concert and I could actually record the songs from the concert while taking video of the group singing.  I love it.","I love this camera. I previously owned a Sony 3.1 MP, which broke after two years. We chose this camera to replace our Sony after reading many good reviews, and I have to say I agree--this is a wonderful camera for the average user.<br /><br /><br /><br />Takes great pictures, easy to use and understand--can't beat it for the price.<br /><br /><br />","I've stuck with kodak through all my digital camera purchases and this is my third one.  The ease of use and fun of Kodak is surpassed by no one and it's a great bargain to boot.  The CX7530 has a maximum resolution of 5 megapixels, for 2560 x 1920 pixel prints.  3X optical zoom and 5X digital zoom bring the action close up and personal.  The movie mode allows you to take videos at a speedy 24 frames per second.  Automatic picture rotation makes pictures taken vertically appear right side up on the camera, computer screen or television. There are Nine picture modes including night, close-up, landscape, black and white and sepia.  And of course there's red-eye reduction.  Quickly use the one-touch easy share button to download, print, or e-mail your pictures.<br /><br />how's the Quality?  how about fabulous...bright, vibrant colors, focused so that droplets of water hang perfectly focused in mid-air.  makes me feel like I am a professional photographer.  The camera features a good-sized and clear LCD screen with automatic shutoff.  I'd rate the CX7530 better than average when it comes to batter consumption.<br /><br />A great camera!","I needed a good point and shoot digital camera at a good price and so I went with this Kodak after quite a bit of research.  I have taken some absolutely beautiful pictures with this camera, right out of the box.  Easy to use, and fantastic results, I highly recomend this camera to anyone who doesn't need the SLR type of control.  A great buy!","I am an amature at picture taking but I am a new mommy and I wanted a digital camera for shooting and e-mailing pics.  I have not been disappointed with this camera it is very user friendly and takes AWSOME pictures EVEN IN LOW LIGHT(there is a feature that automatically brightens your pictures in low to no light).  This camera is worth every penney and I couldn't be happier.  I also have the dock printer which seems to develop better than ANY developing place I have ever used...I am normally not a big spender because Im a FT student but this is worth your money.","The Kodak CX7530 is indeed a wonderful camera. I took lovely pictures of just about everything that i pass by. It is easy, and fast. I have it with a 256MB memory, so storage is even not an issue.<br /><br />It just has two problems:<br /><br />1. You can't store the camera settings (except for the picture quality) - i.e. Your settings will always return to default whenever you change the shooting mode or power off the camera.<br /><br />2. By default, the shots will be kinda dark at the default level of light exposure (even with a flash) unless you are in real strong light.<br /><br />But the darkness issue is never a problem coz the camera comes with an awsome software that makes editing a picture just as easy as shooting them.<br /><br />I shot a picture that was real dark. When displayed on anything, its LCD or my computer all that you can see was a black background. I used the software to increase the light, and i totally got my picture back. It is lovely.<br /><br />It is good on power, it uses just AA battaries and if you've got them rechargable you can stay as long as you like.<br /><br />The camera would have rock even more if it has a stitching feature.","I am very happy to say that I bought this camera over two months ago.  I was not going to get into digital photography because I have a minolta qtsi 35mm camera that I just love.  I take any where from 100-400 pictures a month, not only of my daughter, every event, but also semi professional. I have a camera on me at all times (in search of the perfect picture)  Not only have I actually put down my slr camera I have put down  all its attachments as well.  I have been using this camera alone and I love it.  It takes crisp pictures, and is very detailed.  I actually had a 8x10 show water dropplets that you would have never picked up on my Minolta. I even bought the easy share printer dock (its a must)  to print pictures at home.  This is great for quick prints. I even found it to print better than snap fish, and walmart photo centers.  You will not be let down with this camera! Just shoot,print and enjoy!","I've used several digital cameras and found that the Kodak CX7530 performs beyond expectations for a point-and-shoot camera.  This camera excels in rendering images with incredible sharpness, excellent exposure, and well balanced color saturation.  Dare I say this camera performs as well as the Digital Rebel!<br /><br />I found it rare to get an image out of focus with this camera.  The 5 MP gives me room to crop images without loosing detail.  I was able to figure out all major functions without even opening the manual.  The fast turn-on time, shutter to shot, and shot to shot performance took me by surprize...capture the moment and review it immediately!  There is some metal on the camera that adds ruggedness and gives it a \"well built\" feel.  The large bright LCD helps review image quality quickly as well as help compose without squinting.<br /><br />If you want an excellent point and shoot that gives you fast, sharp, reliable results, then the cx7530 is the perfect choice.<br /><br />Check out my \"customer images\" (link below the cx7530 image, above).<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. multi-point focus always renders sharp foreground images; i found few images out of focus.<br />2. shadows and dark areas are not grainy or noisy; this is helpful when you're cropping pics and enlarging them.<br />3. very smooth transitions in bright area and never washed out; this helps you with contrast especially if you convert to black and white later<br />4. very fast; press the shutter button and you don't miss the moment!<br />5. very quick; shot to shot<br />6. fast turn on; rotate the dial and it's almost ready before you are!<br />7. huge LCD that's sharp, bright, and fast to update while panning<br />8. battery miser; with NiH rechargeables, i was able to get 85 shots where 25 used the flash<br />9. images get auto-rotated when taking a portrait<br />10. very quiet; no focus or zoom noise<br />11. LCD goes blank after a while of no use to conserve power<br />12. 2 movie modes; QVGA (320x240 @ 20fps) and VGA (640x480 @ 13fps);<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. does not remember setting if you change them after you turn off the camera; but i've rarely had to tweek something to get a great image<br />2. 4 way navigation button is on the left and i'm a righty; so this is good for the lefty's; not really an issue, though!<br />3. can not disable digital zoom; but zoom indicator clearly shows the crossover point between optical to digital zoom","This camera is absolutely wonderful and easy to use. You can email pictures directly from the camera via the USB connector in seconds (with the Kodak software). The camera also comes with a video including sound feature - I haven't used it just yet, but I think this a nifty addition for a digital camera. I'm highly impressed with this camera.  Overall great quality for the price!"]},{"name":"Kodak DX7440","amazon_reviews":["I've been looking for this camera for a few years and finally found it!  It works great.","I had this camera once before and loved it and I'm so glad to have it again...it came to me fast, was in described condition and I love it!","camera worked well loved it this was as good as the one I brought for 349  but finding one for<br />a low price is great.my son had dropped my one on the pavement broike the toggle so I  needed<br />this one to replace it . Love this camera the best. Arrived right.","I've had this camera for 11 years now, and still use it - even though it's rather outdated, heavy, clunky-looking, and has far less storage than any present-day smartphone - because it takes superior photos.  It's intuitively easy to use and dependable.  The battery is also 11 years old and still keeps its charge.  I take this along with me in my messenger bag to take pictures on site visits that are part of my work.  It's been jostling around in that bag for years and doesn't seem to be any the worse for the wear because of it.<br /><br />Unfortunately the little orange plastic part that secures the battery inside of its compartment broke within the first year or so, and while it works fine without that part it does make the battery prone to falling out of the camera.  That orange part is very tiny and flimsy.  The little door on the battery compartment should keep it in, but without the orange plastic thingy inside it occasionally opens and the battery escapes - so I typically keep a piece of tape on the battery compartment door now.<br /><br />The other issue I had with camera is that the zoom focus didn't work properly on the first one I received, and I had to return it.

Pictures are so clear due to the all Glass German Lenses... Very sturdy","I've been looking for this camera for a few years and finally found it!  It works great.","I had this camera once before and loved it and I'm so glad to have it again...it came to me fast, was in described condition and I love it!","camera worked well loved it this was as good as the one I brought for 349  but finding one for<br />a low price is great.my son had dropped my one on the pavement broike the toggle so I  needed<br />this one to replace it . Love this camera the best. Arrived right.","I've had this camera for 11 years now, and still use it - even though it's rather outdated, heavy, clunky-looking, and has far less storage than any present-day smartphone - because it takes superior photos.  It's intuitively easy to use and dependable.  The battery is also 11 years old and still keeps its charge.  I take this along with me in my messenger bag to take pictures on site visits that are part of my work.  It's been jostling around in that bag for years and doesn't seem to be any the worse for the wear because of it.<br /><br />Unfortunately the little orange plastic part that secures the battery inside of its compartment broke within the first year or so, and while it works fine without that part it does make the battery prone to falling out of the camera.  That orange part is very tiny and flimsy.  The little door on the battery compartment should keep it in, but without the orange plastic thingy inside it occasionally opens and the battery escapes - so I typically keep a piece of tape on the battery compartment door now.<br /><br />The other issue I had with camera is that the zoom focus didn't work properly on the first one I received, and I had to return it.  The second one worked fine, and still does.","This is the best camera ever owned.<br />It's eleven years old, and works like a charm.

Pictures are so clear due to the all Glass German Lenses... Very sturdy","Received camera quickly and it looked very nice for a used camera. Shot selector dial is very stiff. Don't know if something spilled in it or what. My old one was much smoother.","My camera like this one was stolen and when I found it on Amazon, I was very happy because this is very easy to operate and takes excellent pictures, when I ordered it, it arrived fast and was just as advertised.","I love this camera so much. It's great for anyone who would like to be introduced to digital photography. It takes great pictures in all its modes. The Scene Modes are great and work well for the specified scene, if you don't know how / don't like to program your own settings. It may feel bulky to some, but to me, the weight is ideal. A quick note: in some used DX7440s, the shutter gets stuck closed. All you have to do  is tap the lens barrel (NOT LENS) gently with a pencil for several minutes and it should get unstuck. Other than that, it's great for beginners.","My mother bought this camera several years ago and I inherited it after her death. I'm not a photography expert, in fact I've previously only used cheap consumer cameras, but this seems like a pretty good one to me. As long as you have good lighting, it seems hard to take a bad picture with this camera. Using the Auto setting, most photos come out looking great (in my opinion). There are also a couple dozen special scene modes for capturing specific types of scenes. I've mostly only used the one for closeups, which worked well.<br /><br />However, I haven't yet figured out how to take decent photos in low light. Outdoor photos taken at dusk tend to look like they were taken at midnight, even with using the night setting. If you use the flash in a low-light setting indoors, it tends to completely illuminate the scene and make it look like broad daylight. If you turn off the flash, the image is usually too dark to see anything. Even increasing the brightness/gamma in photo editing software doesn't help, as the detail just isn't there. I'm sure there's probably a way to take photos in low light and get them to look like they do to the naked eye, but I haven't yet figured out how to do that.<br /><br />Once you take a picture, the camera shows you a preview of that photo for several seconds and a few of the other reviewers have mentioned this as an annoyance because it takes several seconds before the camera removes the preview and goes back to normal mode. This can be turned off so that the camera never shows a preview, however there's no need to do that. While the preview is being displayed, you can partially press the shutter button to immediately cancel the preview and return to normal mode. In fact, if you press the shutter button all the way, you can immediately take another photo.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the battery clip, at least in the earlier models is extremely flimsy and will eventually break, no matter how careful you are. The problem is the battery is constantly pushing against it while in the camera and the cheap plastic just isn't strong enough to hold it forever. Kodak should have used a metal part rather than plastic. Thankfully, the compartment door will hold the battery in place just fine. Also, if you hold the camera upside down when inserting or removing a memory card, the battery will stay in contact and you won't have to reset the time and date.<br /><br />From what I've read, the maximum size memory card you can use in the DX7440 is 1GB. While that's plenty of room for hundreds of photos and almost an hour of 640x480 video, the problem is that 1GB cards are relatively scarce now. You can't go into any major store without finding 4GB SD cards, but try to find a 1GB one! I had to order a couple online and paid about as much for two of them as I would have for a 4GB card. It's not just that the camera won't use the extra space, it won't even recognize a 4GB card. A sales rep at Staples told me that I could use a 2GB card and that it would just use half the capacity, but I didn't feel like experimenting.<br /><br />Finally, I know a lot of people like the Kodak Easyshare software, but I hated it! I don't use my camera every day, so I only want the software to run when I need it, but yet, like most software today, it automatically installs itself in the startup so that it runs every time Windows boots. I removed it from the startup, but then getting the camera driver to load was hit-and-miss. Often, I'd have to reboot my system to get it to recognize the camera. As for the software itself, I found it quite primitive. I couldn't find any way to select a range of images to transfer off the camera or to delete. It usually just transferred all the images by default. I also didn't like the way it basically hid the actual files from you so that you had to access them through the Easyshare software. I'm more of a computer nerd, and I want access to the raw files so that I can load them into other programs, manually attach them to email, sort them into directories, burn then to a data disc, etc. I just didn't like the way the Easyshare software seemed to want to be your one and only way to access the photos. Now I just pop the memory card into my card reader and use whatever software I want to access the photos. Much simpler for me.<br /><br />Since you can now get the DX7440 for less than $50, it's a great little bargain. Just don't expect any support from Kodak, even if you buy it new. They consider it outdated and won't even answer email about it.","This is the second of these cameras I have owned.  When my first basically wore out after of several years of hard use and thousands of pictures, I was still so impressed with its performance that I sought to replace it with another of the same model.  It is light and easy to use.  Although not as compact as some of the latest digital cameras, it will readily fit in a jacket pocket.  I take it with me whenever I don't want or need the bulk of my digital SLR.  For most situations, it is literally a 'point and click' type of camera:  turn it on, aim, shoot.  The most common controls, flash mode and zoom, fall readily to the fingertips.  One caution - the zoom feature is great until you push it into the digital zoom mode.  Then you really should use a tripod and hold the camera really still to get decent picture quality.<br />On the back, the on/off switch is part of a mode selection 'wheel.'  When you slect any of the photo options, a brief (very brief) description of the function appears to assist you in making your choices.  Among them is a video mode which includes sound recording.  I find it to be about the quality of a Skype video.<br />All told, I think this is an excellent camera for anyone who wants a compact, sturdy and relatively inexpensive digital camera for everyday use.  As I said, this is the second of this model I have purchased and I have been very pleased with its performance.","You know I have had mine so long that when I bought it I paid over $300.00...And now they are 40 bucks and I can still say this is the BEST camera for everyday use, it really takes some nice shots, it is easy to use, and there is NO lag time with this camera in all of the years I have owned it.<br /><br />I use this camera for every day use when I want some quick shots, or when I am on the go and my heavy big Canon is not to easy to lug around.<br /><br />I LOVE my Canon Rebel, most I ever spent on a camera (almost 1k) in my life, and I own A LOT of digital and film camera's. It is an amazing camera, but as I said sometimes it is just to much to carry around. And my Kodak fits in my purse or pocket easily.<br /><br />It has held up perfectly for at least 8 years now, I have never had it in the shop even once. I have known people I recommended this camera to and instead of getting THIS camera they got a newer version. And they ended up with problems. Be sure to get THIS model and not a newer version because you will have a good camera that you can depend on to do just about anything you want it to..<br /><br />Only ONE problem.. and it's not the camera but Kodak. They have discontinued a cable I need to upload from the camera to the PC so it is really hard to find. I found several on here but I cannot be sure they are the right ones.. I have ordered 2 from different vendors so we shall see.<br /><br />when I get them I will post an update on exactly which cable you need.","I have had a Kodak Easy Share DX7440 for 4 years and gatorade was spilled on it and it has not worked since. I like the camera so much for it being so easy to use and learn all the capabilities that I went online and purchased this used one for about $40 and it is great!","I ordered this Kodak DX-7440 from Bob's Camera and it's the 4th one I've owned.<br />The 1st and 2nd Kodak DX-7440 cameras were stolen from me and the 3rd was destroyed in a crash with a car on my bike and lucky I was able to find my 4th because I like this model over all the others that needs 2 x AA rechargeable or 2 x Alkaline batteries.<br />This model takes the KLIC 5000 or KILC-5001 Li-Ion rechargeable batteries.<br />These camera are really excellent in dealing with shock, I've dropped them on hard surfaces and used them on two of my Currie eZip Trailz electric bikes and they have taken allot of thumbs and bumps and my videos have all come out really well and love the clear colorful photos even in low light.<br />These cameras are over 20 years old so buying a used one is ok as long as you but them from somebody that makes cameras their business like Bob's camera out of Oklahoma and Bob doesn't even know me or that I'm writing this review.<br /><br />I never sent him any messages or ask him anything about the Kodak DX-7440 I bought from him because he had a fair price listed for a the old camera and was honest about it's looks and it ws in good working order.","I was very pleased/satisfied with my purchase.  Initally, I was concerned because it took one week to receive it.  However, as I later discovered, the camera was being shipped from Washington State to Pennsylvania.  If you're in a hurry, you may need to make alternate arrangements for shipping.  Outside of that, I was satisifed with the condition of the camera as well as the seller's timely response to my concerns.  I have yet to print any of the photos, but can't imagine there would be a problem.  I would recommend this seller to anyone.","Purchased for my daughter.  \"Best present ever\". She's spent hours making videos of her friends and cats. Good sound too. Not as compact as some cameras, but I like that it doesn't have a delay when you click.","My husband bought me this camera as a surprise Christmas present about four years ago and it quickly became my favorite camera. It has been my camera of choice for two trips to Disneyland, a trip to Disney World and a cruise. It's a fantastic camera, and very easy for someone not technologically skilled like me to understand how to use. Battery life is great, I'm able to go through about two days of consistent use on our trips before I need to recharge. Speaking of which, recharging is a cinch, I bring the little charger, plug it in at the hotel room in the evening and by the next morning I'm ready to go (usually takes less than that but I plug it in and go to bed).<br /><br />My only problems have been with trying to use the camera in lower lighting situations, like at my children's school assemblies and performances. Perhaps I'm not using the settings correctly but those pictures are coming out too dark with the colors off.<br /><br />This has been one of the best presents ever. We're headed for another trip next year and this camera will be on my \"must pack\" list.","We've had this camera since June of '05....and it still works great!  I love how easy it is to use!  Turning it on/off, zooming, reviewing and sharing the photos is so easy.  There are 3 of us in our family with the same camera, and we all love it so much.  Now that Kodak makes nothing similar to replace it with, we are being more careful with it to make sure nothing happens to it. We use it all the time (especially with a 2 year old!) and have just started to notice that it needs a new battery.  Wish Kodak would introduce the same camera again with a few updates.  Definately reccomend hanging on to this camera if you have one...or buy it if you find one!  It's really great!","After reading the negative reviews on this little camera, I felt obliged to put in my two-cents' worth!  I've used a Kodak DX4530 (Excellent camera) for about 4 years now and decided to hand it down to my daughter.  I came across a DX7440 in a pawn shop.  It was mint condition, but the pawn shop owner thought he fried the camera accidentally. I handed him $25 and walked away with my PRIZE!  I ordered new batteries for it, THREE KLIC-5001 batteries for $18 TOTAL.  I was not sure if it would work until I received my batteries, charged one and tried to use it. Well, it worked.....and is a fantastic little camera. No need to pay $30 for a single battery when you can order a set of 3 KLIC-5001's for a total of $18 (already includes shipping).<br /><br />It may not be small enough to fit into your pocket, but unlike the newer pocket-sized cameras, the DX7440 has large front and back hand-grip areas - where the newer cameras are SO compact, that there is no place to grip the back with your thumb, and little area on the front.  So I would gladly give up a \"pocket option\" for these benefits.  Plus, the \"feel\" of this camera in my hand represents (to me) a feel of quality.<br /><br />As for fuzzy pictures, I have yet to take one where it was the camera's fault.  Now that I know all the options available on my DX7440, my family is stunned at the quality of pictures from this little camera. I took three pictures using the three obvious features and the picture started out VERY blurry.  The second was still awful, but much better than the 1st.  The 3rd picture, using the top \"flower\" button option, was stunning!  So one only need learn the abilities of the camera.<br /><br />As for not taking pictures well inside or in dark areas -- again, using the correct simple options available on this camera, I have yet to miss a great picture opportunity in the dark.  They are fantastic!  One must simply read the manual and learn the camera.  It is truly a great little camera with so many options for the price.<br /><br />The unlimited video-taking is great and the quality of the video is great. Keep in mind that this is a digital CAMERA, not a dedicated video camera.  Obviously, the internal memory is insufficient for handling much video. So you would be well advised to purchase additional memory for your DX7440.<br /><br />The automatic lens cover is great!  My DX4530 had a cap that popped off and dangled from a tether.  So the auto-lens cover is a welcomed addition.<br /><br />There are only two negative things stated about this little DX7440 that I cannot defend.  One is that the battery clip (orange tab) breaks easily.  But it is an irrelevant piece.  The door holds the KLIC-5001 quite well.  I'm not sure about the KLIC-5000 battery, given that it is a thinner battery.  But personally, I prefer the 5001 because it lasts longer - and the 5001 charger came with the camera from the pawn shop! Be forewarned though: DO NOT try to charge a KLIC-5000 battery in a KLIC-5001 charger.  You will fry the battery!<br /><br />The other negative comment made about this camera is a biggie!  The Mode Dial (or \"wheel\" as we are calling it) can be a problem for some.  My camera works perfect, as does my parents.  But when I tried to find a good used one for my sister, the first one arrived with a Mode Dial that would hardly turn at all.  I returned it.  I bought another used one, which camera is in mint condition.  But again, the Mode Dial was very difficult to turn.  After using it quite a few times, my sister says it's working just great now. Not sure what causes the Mode Dial problem, if it's preventable or user-induced problem.  The used we bought for us and the used one we bought for my parents work like a charm! Initially, we took my sister's camera to a camera shop and they suggested that it may have some dust or dirt lodged behind the wheel (and this must have been the case, since hers is now working great!) The wheel is obviously connected to the control circuit board, which is essentially the entire camera.  So if there is a problem with the wheel of a NEW camera, you would be well advised to return it immediately to have the problem fixed by Kodak.<br /><br />I would mention as well, that it is better to first deal with Kodak via E-mail.  You will get personal attention a little easier that way, and be locked into a particular person.  They DO have nice and knowledgeable people there....if you go about it the right way!  It may not be as simple as picking up a phone, but it will get the job done!<br /><br />We now have three of these DX7440s in our family and we are ALL very thrilled with the picture/video/sound/option qualities of this little camera.","YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WHEN YOU PURCHASE THE DIGITAL CAMERA....I BROKE MY FIRST ONE AND I LIKE IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT A 2nd.","I have had my camera for over 2 years now and I like it so well that I bought two more, one for my Mom and one for my Dad. I also recommended this camera to a friend and she loves it. We off road in Jeeps and this camera has been subjected to all kinds of things like dirt, mud and rain as well as being banged around over ruff terrain and it has never let me down. It takes excellent pictures and it doesn't have a delay when you take the picture like so many cameras have today. It's very easy to use and always takes a great picture.","I am not a camera guru and I HATE to read directions and try to remember ambiguous symbols on cameras that are crucial to set before taking a picture.  That's why I love this camera.  The purpose for any button you push appears in text on the screen.  My pictures also come out great!  The software is easy to use.  I guess the only flaw I've found is that the digital zoom is a worthless feature.  It is too blurry to use.","When I was camera shopping, I did not have Kodak in mind. I was thinking of the bigger players like Sony, Cannon, Nikon, ect but I love this camera!<br /><br />1- It takes great pictures. A lot of cameras these days are 6 or 7 MP and a 4 MP camera sounds ancient. However, a 4 MP is way good and I actually put my settings to 3.1 MP. I developed it at the store at it look just as good as a 35 mm camera! Also, I can store a lot more pictures at 3.1 MP and am VERY satisfied with the image quality.<br /><br />2- It's FAST. Takes the picture when you click the button! You do have to wait a few seconds to take another picture (there is a processing time) but I find this much more bearable than the initial lag that some cameras have.<br /><br />3- It's very user friendly but offers other options for more advanced picture taking. You don't even have to read the manual to use the more advanced options- it's great.<br /><br />One of the disadvantage is size. I was well aware of this when I bought the camera but I wanted something nice in my hand that I can hold. I now wish I would have gone with a thinner camera so it will fit in my pocket. I am younger (21) and when you're going out to clubs, you're usually not bringing a huge purse so the camera seems kind of bulky. However, I do like the feel of this camera much more than little ones. If I was middle-aged, I'd much rather have this one than the tiny ones. I have no problems with the size other than when I'm going out.<br /><br />I did tons of research when I bought this camera and have 0 regrets. However, I will make other noteworthy concerns by other reviewers that I took into consideration when purchasing this camera.<br /><br />1- the wheel is small and you need to push this little button simultaneously while turning. If you have large hands, it might be a problem. I am a small girl, so it works fine for me (not my father). Also, sometimes the wheel can be hard to move if you haven't used it in a long time. It's a delicate wheel, don't force it or it will break.<br /><br />2- be careful when replacing the batteries. Many people have reported breaking the orange tab meant to put the battery in place when they replaced the battery. As long as you're careful and take your time, it works fine.","My husband and I bought this camera almost a year ago, and after taking (literally) over two thousand pictures, it still works perfectly. I'll never understand everything it does, so I leave all the buttons on the top alone, but it still takes great pictures. The only cons are: when taking photos indoors (I noticed this while taking pics at my nieces basketball game) they will be dark if taken from a distance. I'm sure there is a setting I could change it to to fix this, but I haven't found it. Also, whenever you take the battery out you have to reset the time and date. That gets annoying after a while. Other than that it's a wonderful camera and is doing a great job of capturing my newborn!","I bought this camera in 4 months back. It seems to be working well except that the lighting is not very good. I've had my friends say that I should turn on the flash which in fact I did. The real bad thing about this camera is the dial. Mine broke in 3 months. I have to ship it back to get it fixed.<br /><br />Apart from that this is a good piece is this is the first time you are buying one","I bought the Kodak DX7440 about 2 months ago.  Along with that I ordered the Camera Dock, and a couple of extra batteries (which hasn't gotten used yet, because the one I have in there has never died on me. I just keep it on the camera dock while not in use and it keeps it full), and a 512mb sd card (which allows me to take close to 400 pictures at a time before having to upload them to my computer.) plus the internal memory allows you to take 21-24 pictures.  I have a 2 1/2 year old, and he's constantly running around outside, and my old camera usually would blur almost every picture, however the dx 7440... it takes crystal clear pictures, absolutely nothing is blurry if he's running around and I snap a picture, it captures him full focus, his blue eyes (not red), if his hair is standing up on the top of his head you see that, (not like previous pictures which makes him look like a comet with a tail) and one of the best things about this camera is that's it's always ready to take a picture, no processing everytime you click a picture.(my previous camera after every 1 or 2 pictures it would process for what seemed like 20 seconds... and ofcourse it would happen everytime my son would be ready to take a good picture.<br /><br />I don't know how I ever managed without this camera...  I have taken such great pictures of my family with this camera, I can't wait to see how good it does on our vacations this summer.  the black and white settings, I think will look so good at the beach I am so anxious to see what memories I will be able to capture this vacation that I was unable to do on previous ones.","The Kodak Easyshare Z730 Digital Camera with 4X optical zoom is a great camera for your everyday practical uses.  This camera is suited for the amateur photographer whose is just beginning to use a digital camera.  Yet the pictures taken with this camera deliver high quality.  For those trying digital photography the Z730 is the perfect camera.<br /><br />  The best features this camera has are the ease of taking pictures and the numerous settings for different picture - taking scenarios.  The zoom dial on the Z730 is located on the top right of the camera and is used by moving it to the right or left.  Many cameras zoom buttons are located near the display screen on the back and while you are trying to take the perfect picture, it has passed.  When you take a picture there is no delay like many other digital cameras which is great for catching that perfect moment.  There is also a shutter sound after taking a picture which assures that the photo has been taken.  The photo can be viewed on the 2.2 inch hi - resolution display screen on the back of the camera.  Many other cameras with the same price offer a 1.5 inch display and lack the resolution quality on the Z730.  With many digital cameras you must go through several menu pages to pick the setting for different picture taking situations.  The Z730 has a small dial on the back and you can turn it to take pictures in low to high lighting, fast moving objects, different color shades, and the list goes on.  The flash is easily turned off by pressing a button on top of the camera and does not require going through an options menu.<br /><br />  Offering a Kodak Easyshare camera dock and the ease of transferring your pictures from the camera to a personal computer (PC) is one of the major selling points of this camera.  The camera dock is only available for the Kodak Easyshare cameras and relieves the photographer of taking the memory card to a local developer in order to obtain pictures.  The dock prints in high quality and it is simple as scrolling through the photos and pressing the print button on the printer dock.  The camera comes with a compact disc and USB cable for transferring photos from camera to PC.  The compact disc explains a step by step process of taking photos from the camera and placing them on the hard drive of the computer.<br /><br />  Life is full of little moments that should be frozen in time and the Kodak Easyshare Z730 is just the camera to do it.","Digital cameras are in and disposable cameras are out. The Kodak Easyshare camera DX7440 says just how easy it is in the title. This phenomenal camera has brought pictures to a<br /><br />whole new level of quality and will have an individual wanting to take more and more pictures than ever.<br /><br />  The sixteen automatic scene modes programed on this camera have made the quality of my pictures sky rocket. Modes such as \"objects in motion\" to \"distant scenery\" create an<br /><br />excellent picture quality. The fact that there is a long lasting battery gives the individual time to pick which mode they would like to use; it's not a race against time. Disposable cameras on the other hand tend to be a \"pain in the butt.\" The only option an individual has is to have a flash or not have a flash. Also, there is no substance or quality to the picture. An individual does not have the option to look at their picture on an lcd screen opposed to the Kodak Easyshare camera,  which provides an excellent screen.<br /><br />  The best feature Kodak Easyshare camera provides is the \"movie mode.\" There are a total thirty-two mega bites available for personal recording. This product provides<br /><br />video recording, saving individuals the hassle of using both a camera and a camcorder.Whenever there is a movie someone would like to delete, it can be deleted with the click of a<br /><br />button; pictures can be deleted as well. On the other hand, disposable cameras only provide pictures; movie options are not available. Also, pictures can not be deleted from a disposable camera.<br /><br />  Another available option that comes equipped with the Easyshare camera is picture sharing. This easy to use program comes right with the camera, along with a touch up program to fix red eye problems. This process takes seconds depending on the total amount of pictures stored on your camera. There is one cord that connects a camera to the computer allowing each picture to be stored on any computer. Two-hundred pictures can be stored on the camera at one time. Purchasing a digital camera saves  an individual time by emailing pictures to friends opposed to copying them on a machine and then sending them through the mail. This process is costly and inconvenient.<br /><br />  A digital Camera is expensive, but worth the money. Digital cameras save a person time and money, but also gives a person the choice to delete what pictures they do not like. The Easyshare camera is an  easy camera to operate; I wouldn't recommend any other camera to a first time user.","I love my Kodak.  It's easy to use, and the picture quality is outstanding.  I took it to the Butterfly Conservatory in Niagara Falls, Canada, and took photots that look like they were clipped out of a magazine.  I've only encountered one problem with the camera:  The plastic piece that is supposed to hold the battery snuggly in place snapped off.  The piece is truly uneccesary, as the battery is sufficently held in place by the battery door, but none-the-less, the piece did break.  I still rate this camera at 4 stars, though, because I am thrilled with the quality of the pictures I've taken with it.","I take very good pictures, and is very quickly to turn on and turn off, the zoom is explendit, in fact, is a high quality camera for all users. The problem, the flash is very stronge and, sometimes, the indoors pictures look so white. Sorry for my bad english...","I purchased this camera after also considering a Canon.  My wife already has the software for Kodak, so this made the decision an easy one.  The camera is easy to use and downloading pictures is a breeze.  Daytime shots are very clear and the camera is comfortable.  On the negative side, though, indoor and nighttime shots are poor.  Overall, a good camera for the price that i paid from Amazon.","I really enjoy the fast speed of this camera.  Previous digital cameras that I have had took way too long to focus and take the picture.  It does seem that the focus is better if I give the camera enough time to properly focus, but it will take the picture quickly when I need to capture a fleeting instant (probably by using a default focus setting).<br /><br />Be careful when inserting the battery, however!  The battery clip is flimsy and easily broken.  We had to exchange our camera for a new one after only a few days because the clip broke.  We have not had any more problems since, but we handle battery changes very carefully.  Fortunately, the battery charge lasts a long time.  We are ordering the larger 1700 mAh battery to reduce the frequency of battery changes.  Of course, another alternative is to buy a docking station, which charges the battery while still in the camera.","I can't tell you how much I LOVE this camera!  Sure, there are a few flaws (explained later), but overall, this camera is awesome; a full 98 of 100.  I bought this camera nearly 8 months ago, and I've had maybe three times where I couldn't figure out how to get a  GREAT picture.  Not just a good picture, but a GREAT picture!  I've used the auto settings indoors and out, the movie video to record the kids playing in the [high glare] snow and videos of rushing rivers, catching fish; I've used the fireworks setting (and actually turned out some beautiful photos of fireworks!) Try that out on any other camera.  The multi-picutre (\"like a model\") setting where you take 6 or 9 photos in immediate succession has produced some terrific shots I would have otherwise missed using my regular camera.  I wish I could show you the zoom capabilities - we went to the mountains, and I used the \"mountains\" setting, and it was incredible. I've never run out of space for my pictures, and I've had several hundred of them at a time, including videos.<br /><br />The software that comes with the camera is great, too!  I'd been using Adobe Photoshop for nearly two years, but now I use the Kodak Easy Share instead.  Red eye?  Click.  Now they're blue eyes.  Photo dull?  Click.  It's autoadjusted.  The only software adjustment I'd make it to auto click the zoom in and out feature, or by keystroke, but hey, maybe it does and I just haven't found it yet.  I don't like the file folder settings very much, because when I renamed them later, it couldn't find it.  (Adobe can find it...)<br /><br />I really wanted a \"larger\" camera that fit my hands, and wouldn't get confused with my cell phone in my bag, but was small at the same time.  I like the \"adjustable\" view finder, where I can set it to my very own vision characteristics, not the \"generic\" 20/20 vision.  I also like the easy turn of the settings, but locked in place so I don't mess up.  Can you tell I LIKE THIS CAMERA!!!!<br /><br />The downs sides:  Like others, the re-sestting of the date everytime you take out the battery is just nonsense, and frankly, well below Kodak's standard.  I didn't think it would bother me, as I though how often would I take out the battery?  I never took out the other ones.... Well, if you want to recharge the battery, you take it out!  (Or you can buy an adapter, ranging from $25 to $200, depending on what else you might want it to do, like print, sort, etc.)  Normally, I like the date on my photos, but the automatic date on this camera is HUGE and bright yellow.  Too big, especially when you crop the photo and get only a partial date.  So I turn it off, and self date when I upload to a website, or on my own disc.<br /><br />I LOVE the quick shutter response -- no more \"lost\" shots while the camera readied itself or focused; but I do not love the time it takes to re-ready itself after showing a preview.  But I can turn that off if I like.... but I do like seeing the preview to make sure I captured the shot I wanted.<br /><br />I have not been able to get a good, distant indoor shot, say at a graduation setting.  I can get the lighting right, but without a tripod, I cannot get it sharp enough.  So, I've given up on that! But I haven't tried all the settings yet; I imagine there's one that will work.<br /><br />I've had the fortunate experience of shopping for a digital camera for my son; and guess what -- even 8 months later, I  $100 cheaper than advertised at CompUSA; new in box, full warranty.  Perhaps an unadvertised special?<br /><br />Thanks; enjoy.","This camera rules!!!<br /><br />I was a little hesitant at first and wasnt sure to go with KODAK other than brands like Sony or Cannon. I took my time and did some research regarding my specific needs (I am not a pro-photographer, just aficionado). It really paid off!!!<br /><br />If your looking for a USER-FRIENDLY, inexpensive and really really HIGH QUALITY digital, this is your best bet 100%<br /><br />I got a 256 Memory Card with it and thats more than enough for a complete vacations worth of great pictures (almost 400 pics!).<br /><br />The quality of the pictures and the wide variety of settings makes this baby ideal for almost any occasion.<br /><br />You cannot go wrong with this Camera, I also reccomend you get the case, it is pretty nifty and comes in handy for under 15$.","As a serious hobbyist used to shooting with a Minolta SLR with both auto and manual modes and a big telephoto zoom lens, I waited for the digital cameras to drop in price and rise in quality and features.  On the recommendation of my professional photographer friends who said, \"Hey, in 2-3 years, it'll be obsolete, and you'll want a new one\", I decided that I'd spend around $200 for the camera.<br /><br />As advertised, the DX744O takes great pictures, is easy to use, and a snap to transfer images from camera to my computer, even without a dock!  It also fits on my standard tripod, which means that I'm going out to shoot fireworks on the Fourth of July!<br /><br />The camera gives me everything that my SLR did except for a 300mm telephoto, which is okay because I can always take long shots with the SLR.","After a couple of months of research and temporizing, I took the decision over the weekend on which digital camera to buy to replace my aging Kodak 2MP model. My new digicam? Another Kodak, the DX7440.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />A few months ago I was looking for a camera for my mom. Since she's somewhat of a technophobe, I wanted something simple. And since your close-up vision starts to go south with age, I wanted something with a big LCD. I also wanted something that about the same size as her old film camera. I brought her to Best Buy and we looked at a bunch of cameras... from Olympus, Canon, Sony, and Kodak. I ended up getting her the DX7440, even before I'd reviewed it.<br /><br />I'm no technophobe, but I went to look at the camera and was plenty impressed. The LCD screen is huge and high resolution. Life Jeff's mom, my close-up vision isn't what it used to be; compared to the two Canons, the Kodak LCD won in a walk. I found the Kodak's menus much easier to read than the Canons'.<br /><br />But that wasn't the only thing that made the Kodak win. Not only were the Canons' menus hard to read for me, they were unfamiliar. Doubtless my learning curve would have been fairly short, but I already knew the Kodak's menus. Also, the \"scene\" customization for the Kodak was slightly more comprehensive and scenes are very easy to select.<br /><br />The Kodak was praised in reviews for its extremely short shutter lag, short shot-to-shot time, and, importantly to me, its low-light performance, including that it would focus even below 1 lux. Its specs in these categories were superior to the Canons'. Both cameras offer full-manual operation, though neither allow manual focusing. The Kodak permits time exposure up to 64 seconds, four times as long as the Canons.<br /><br />Nonetheless, everything involves tradeoffs. For the Kodak I gave up AA-battery power; the Kodak uses a KLIC-5000 or 5001 proprietary batteries. The 1050 mAh-5000 battery is included and I bought a 5001, 1700-mAh second battery. So far, though, the OEM battery is doing well.<br /><br />I also gave up some compactness. The Kodak is noticeably larger than the Canons, though not massively larger. So the Kodak is not quite as \"pocketable\" as the Canon models -room for that big LCD has to come from somewhere. OTOH, the Kodak's larger form factor makes room for dedicated buttons on top for controlling flash, focus and exposure, which I have already found very useful.<br /><br />Two features the Kodak has that the Canons lack is a diopter-focus knob (again, important for my presbyopic eyes) and a shuttle-jog dial on the top-right rear for easy manual customization. You can also save a manual setting as a custom set, enabling you to create your own scene mode. I don't think you can do this on the Canons.<br /><br />Both cameras take video with sound. The Kodak will take VGA (640X480) size movies, but only at a jerky 15 frames per second. It also takes 320X240 video at 24 fps, which is 4/5th full speed. That video looks pretty nice actually, but it has less resolution than the VGA mode. Both modes are superior to the Canons, and both modes on the Kodak will record to the limit of your SD card. A high-speed card is not necessary. On my 512kb card I can record more than 45 minutes of 320/240 video, not too shabby! The Canons' recording lengths are limited to 30 seconds in VGA, at an even more miserable 10 fps, and three minutes at 320/240 at 15 fps. Clear winner: Kodak, and you don't need a high-speed SD card to record either mode.<br /><br />But there is a serious drawback to the Kodak package: the included Easyshare software simply refuses to install on my computer. Judging from the Kodak forums  online, I'm not the only one with that problem. I have other photo-management software. HP's ImageMixer was included on my computer, so I'm not out of luck, and the free-download Infraview takes care of redeye, editing and color management. (Speaking of redeye, DC Resource said that it was a real problem on the Canons, very little on the Kodak.) But doggone it, I paid for Easyshare and I want to use it - it's supposed to be a very good package, anyway. (The Kodak help page was not helpful.)<br /><br />(...)","This is one of the best digital cameras I've used, and I've worked with a few in my career. Nice, big viewing screen for framing, quick shutter speed, and easy to use. You don't have to be made of stone to hold the machine still enough to get crystal-clear shots, and the camera is compact enough to tote around on vacation or fit into an average-sized briefcase. (You can also use it to make short video clips. While this is not a feature I use on a frequent basis, it's a fun perk to have.)<br /><br />I did alot of research before buying this camera, and this model has gotten good reviews from almost every authority I consulted before buying. You won't regret it - it's definitely worth the money. Many cameras that sell for more don't match the features this model offers.","A little background: I currently have 2 film cameras: a 70s-era fully<br /><br />manual SLR 35mm with a variety of lenses and a point-n-shoot compact<br /><br />35mm.  Like most, I love the exposure flexibility and lens options on<br /><br />the SLR but the simplicity of the other is useful on most occasions.<br /><br />So, of course, I'm looking for the best of both worlds.<br /><br />The key things I was looking for in a camera:<br /><br />(in order of importance)<br /><br />- excellent prints up to 8x11\"...which basically means a minimum<br /><br />  of 4M-pixel resolution, allowing for some cropping of the shots<br /><br />- at least 3x optical zoom<br /><br />- shoot 640x480 video without an arbitrary length limit (subject to<br /><br />  the available memory, of course).<br /><br />- print photos without a computer<br /><br />- largeer than average size screen (>2\")<br /><br />- macro mode - ability to shoot very close-up shots<br /><br />- full-manual mode - allow control over all aspects of the<br /><br />  shot, just like a high-end 35mm camera<br /><br />- assisted-manual mode - choose one key setting, such as shutter<br /><br />  speed, and the camera will optimize the other settings for the<br /><br />  best shot<br /><br />After much online research and two trips to the local camera shop, I<br /><br />ended up with a Canon camera and printer.  The salesperson had WRONGLY<br /><br />told me there was no video length limit.  But even though the built-in<br /><br />memory was enough for several minutes of video, it would cut off after<br /><br />30 seconds for no apparent reason.  Additionally, the printer could<br /><br />only print from the camera, not the computer, which I discovered after<br /><br />several hours of frustration.  I was glad that I bought it locally - I<br /><br />returned both items.  Incidentally, I bought them at the local Wolf<br /><br />Camera.  While it could be had cheaper online, the price differential<br /><br />was not much and the service was great.<br /><br />I ended up with a Kodak DX7440 and Easyshare Printer/Dock.  I also bought<br /><br />a 512M expansion card for the camera.  Total cost ~$600.  Normally this<br /><br />would be a little pricey for my taste.  But with the arrival of the<br /><br />kids, the upcoming holidays with the grandparents visiting and a small<br /><br />windfall in our pockets, we decided it would be well spent.  It was.<br /><br />Kodak's DX-models are the enthusiast line.  One step above the consumer<br /><br />line (CX), but one below the pro line (Z).  This translates to a<br /><br />professional-grade lens, but still a compact size.<br /><br />Size<br /><br />It is small, but not tiny.  About the size of most point-n-shoot 35mm<br /><br />cameras.  IMO, if it was any smaller, it would be too small to hold<br /><br />comfortably.  For reference, I have slightly small hands for a 5'10\"<br /><br />male.  It is a little thick for pants pockets (except cargo-style pants)<br /><br />but fits nicely in a jacket pocket.<br /><br />Screen<br /><br />The 2.2\" screen is large enough to view pics without squinting.<br /><br />Coupled with the \"favorites\" gallery, it's a great way to show off<br /><br />your pics if you happen to have the camera with you.  It seems to<br /><br />be bright enough for viewing anywhere, but I have used it only a<br /><br />few times outdoors.<br /><br />Ease-of-use<br /><br />After demonstration by the salesperson, I have rarely consulted<br /><br />the manual (maybe never?).  The on-screen display and help are<br /><br />very intuitive.  The most-frequently used photo options (flash<br /><br />setting, burst and normal/macro/lanscape) are on the top<br /><br />of the camera.  The zoom is right in front of the shutter button.<br /><br />The camera modes and menu/review navigation are all controlled<br /><br />with a dial and joystick that is intuitive, but probably too<br /><br />small for fat-fingered-folk.  I would have to rate the ease-of-use<br /><br />as excellent.<br /><br />Auto-mode<br /><br />According to the reviews, this camera has one of the best \"auto\" modes<br /><br />- which is very point-and-shoot.  In my experience, most pictures in<br /><br />typical situations come out very well.  It has a no-red-eye flash mode<br /><br />that works very well.  Except, of course, that the double-flash tends<br /><br />to make people blink and distracts kids.  The Easyshare software (on the<br /><br />computer) does an excellent job of removing red-eye with a click of a<br /><br />button - so I rarely use the no-red-eye flash mode.  However, this<br /><br />editing is not available without the computer, so when I'm planning<br /><br />to print directly from the camera, the no-red-eye is a necessity.<br /><br />Macro-mode<br /><br />The macro-mode (very-close-up) is pretty darn good - they claim a<br /><br />minimum focal distance of 3.9\", which I have not confirmed but<br /><br />I think I've come close to that.<br /><br />Scenes<br /><br />It has 16 scene modes, such as daylight-beach, night, sunset,<br /><br />snow, portrait, indoor-party, sport, text, fireworks, museum,<br /><br />backlight, etc.  These are very handy because giving the camera<br /><br />a 'hint' about the environment you are shooting in greatly<br /><br />increases the photo quality in difficult environments.  I've<br /><br />only used a few so far (backlight, party), but they worked well.<br /><br />I didn't compare them to \"auto\" mode on the same picture.<br /><br />Video<br /><br />With the expansion memory, it will shoot almost 30 minutes of 640x480<br /><br />video at ~15fps.  Although I don't remember it mentioned in the specs,<br /><br />I seems to have anti-shake compensation because the vids seem steadier<br /><br />than my hand.  Unfortunately, the native format is quicktime (.mov)<br /><br />which none of the grandparents computers had installed.  So I also<br /><br />needed some software to convert to a more Windows-friendly format.<br /><br />I wondered if I would really use the video features - they have been<br /><br />great for the intended usage - sending vids of the boys to the grand-<br /><br />parents.  While we send them plenty of pics, I think they really love<br /><br />to be able to see (and hear) the kids playing, rolling, sitting, etc.<br /><br />Printing<br /><br />The print quality for 4x6\" prints are excellent quality, IMO.  They<br /><br />look as good as any 35mm shots I've ever produced, anyway.  Printing<br /><br />from the camera directly to the printer is pretty easy.  Dock, turn on,<br /><br />choose picture, choose size, print.  You can print 1 4x6, 2 3x4s,<br /><br />4 2x3s or 8 2x1.3s on a single sheet.  The special paper/print<br /><br />cartridge packs cost $25 for 40 prints.  This comes to 60c per print,<br /><br />which is kinda pricey.  However, since we never print a picture we<br /><br />don't really like, I'm not sure we are spending much more per picture<br /><br />than with film.  The instant gratification is nice when visiting<br /><br />friends and grandparents can take the pictures home with them.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />Obviously, I'm happy with the purchase.  I'm sure there are cameras<br /><br />that take equally nice pictures and cost less.  And the Canon printer<br /><br />cost significantly less per print to operate.  But for the combination<br /><br />of features I was looking for, this camera/printer was a great choice.","This is my third digigal camera and a good value.  A good balance between zoom and MP.  If you have a spare battery and change it quickly, you will not lose the date - I suggest you buy one. Also buy a large 512 memory.  You will not be disappointed.","Great camera. My previous two cameras were Nikon coolpix 995 and Cannon Ixus V3. I found this to be extremely user friendly with a variety of shooting options readily avaialble which are easy to comprehend within a short time. Print results were superb. Buy it and you won't regret. Good value for money.","I've been into photography for about 10 years now and I've taken 4 years of photography class.  I never thought I'd switch to digital until my wife bought me the Kodak DX7440.  Unbelievable!  That's all I can say about this camera.  It has the convienience of a point and shoot with all the features of a standard SLR.  It can be fully automatic and still take crystal clear photos or it can become partially or fully manual and allows the user to adjust anything they want.  I am totally impressed with this camera.  I have recomended it to everyone who has talked to me about buying a digital camera.  It is perfect!","Great little camera. Takes really nice pictures. Like the way the sets are placed and shape. Very happy with it. I've had a panasonic lumix for years, thats a great camera too. The body is almost equal but this little EasyShare is lighter to handle.<br /><br />The only downfall I felt was upon recieving there was no memorie card to insert into the camera. For a new comer this would be a big dissappointment buying this camera kit.  Won't work without a memorie card to hold the pictures.  Good thing I had bought one.  Most camera kits include at least a 16mm memorie card in it. So do your homework...","This is my first digital camera.  Not knowing too much about digital cameras I did a lot of research on options, reviews, and prices, and I came across the Kodak DX7440.  I bought it, holding my breath wondering whether it was a good camera or a lemon, and found out it was neither;  This is a GREAT camera!<br /><br />Things I like about this camera...<br /><br />-Intuitive design.  All the controls can be accessed by the thumb and the forefinger.  A dial around the shutter release controls the zoom lens, pressing the shutter release halfway down controls the auto-focus, a large dial in the rear selects the different functions, and a tiny joystick in the center of the dial cycles through the function option.  You can literally control the camera with one hand.<br /><br />-Nice feel.  The right side of the camera is enlarged with a rubberized surface to give a better grip on the camera, and it's heavy enough to feel like it's not just a cheap piece of plastic.<br /><br />-viewer.  The LCD viewer is huge, bigger on this camera than I've seen it on others.  There is also an optical viewer, but I've found that I don't need it.  It also allows you to cycle throught the photos you've taken, and if you don't like it, a press of a button deletes it.<br /><br />-photo quality.  This camera has a color enhancing chip which brings out the true natural color of the subject.  Photos appear as if you're actually looking at them, instead of just a flat image like you'd see in film.  This $250-$300 digital camera takes just as good or even better photos as my friend's $1000+ regular camera<br /><br />-aesthetics.  The one thing that turned me off from getting a digital camera is that most of them have a weird new-age shiny silver case, like something NASA would make.  This one is much more conservative, with a subdued metallic flake gray with black grips and lens.<br /><br />-compatability.  You can plug it directly into your PC to transfer the photos for email, OR you can take out the memory card and bring it to a drugstore photo kiosk, OR you can plug it directly into your TV via video out and show your photos or mini-movies on your television.<br /><br />-low light quality.  The low light photos this camera takes isn't too impressive, but it's no worse than a regular film camera.  However, if you use the \"night time\" option, and if you can hold the camera steady enough, the shots it can take are almost breathtaking.<br /><br />Things I don't like about this camera...<br /><br />-Battery life.  The battery holds enough charge for maybe 50 pictures, becuase the the LCD viewer you're using to take them is a huge drain on the battery.  Remember to turn it off when you're not using it.<br /><br />-too many confusing icons.  There are more icons you need to look up than there are on your PC, and not all of them are helpful.  Some of the best photos I ever took with this camera had an icon of a garbage can appear on the monitor when I shot them, which I take to mean \"my photo was a piece of trash.\"<br /><br />-Constant need to reset date.  Every time you take the battery out you need to reset the date, and it gets old fast.  However all the other settings you put into the camera remain.  Weird.<br /><br />-Accessories.  The DX7440 comes with 32 meg of memory, which you will find out quickly that it isn't enough.  You're required to go out any buy an additional SD memory card to take advantage of its capabilities.  There's also an available docking station which recharges the camera without needing to remove the battery, as well as transferring the photos you took to the PC.  You don't absolutely need it, but Kodak does its bit to \"encourage\" you to buy it to make your life easier.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent first time camera with only a few things to detract from it (unless you don't care about them, in which case, go ahead and give it another star).  If you yourself are looking for a first time digital camera, you won't be disappointed with the DX7440.  Overwhelmed with the options and things you can do with it, perhaps, but not disappointed.","Going into digital photography, I had no idea what the factors were to look at, so I read a lot of materials about a lot of cameras. The ones that seemed to be the best were Nikon (which has an attachment for photographing slides), Canon, and (surprising to me) Kodak. The factors that turned me towards this camera were:<br /><br />1. 4.0 megapixels. 3.2 megapixels is the minimum to get decent pictures that print up well at sizes up to 8x12 inches. Different settings provide different formats in terms of relative dimensions, which may result in some cropping of your pictures (a 3x5 picture will be cropped compared to a 4x6 because of the different dimensions). You can set this camera to shoot at different resolutions, including 3.2 megapixels, which is ideal for shooting 4x6 inch photos. You can select sizes down to 1.2 megapixels, with corresponding losses in resolution and gains in the number of photos that can be stored on a memory card.<br /><br />2. Quality of the pictures. The resolution and color are excellent. I used it in Florence this last week without flash in the museums, and found that this camera is far better than film cameras with 400 speed film in picking up images.<br /><br />3. 4x optical zoom, which is significantly better than the 3x offered on most cameras in this price range. Anything more than that, and you'll get blurred pictures, unless you use a tripod.<br /><br />4. The camera is about the right size (many Asian manufacturers miniaturize their cameras to the point they are hard to use), and is comfortable to hold.<br /><br />5. Ease of use. The automatic setting will handle most situations, but the camera also has a large number of pre-settings and allows a limited amount of manual control.<br /><br />Like all digital cameras, you will have to buy several accessories to use this one properly, including:<br /><br />1. A large memory card. 512MB will store in excess of 350 pictures at fine resolution. Larger cards are now available, but the manual doesn't discuss them, which may mean they're incompatible with the camera.<br /><br />2. A charging dock, which will allow you to recharge the camera without removing the battery  by just plugging it into the dock. The DX 6000 charging dock will take voltage inputs between 110 and 240, which means you can use it overseas, provided you have the appropriate adapter.<br /><br />3. A larger battery (1750 mAh) to replace the 1050 mAh battery the camera comes with;<br /><br />4. A carrying case. Get the cheap small one [ASIN: B00006HXMQ]<br /><br />5. Hold off on buying a printer dock until you know whether you will actually use it. You may want to e-mail your photos to a printing service or use a drugstore kiosk.<br /><br />The camera comes with Kodak software, which I found useless. If you use Windows XP, your computer will recognize the camera as a memory device, allowing you to transfer pictures easily.","I bought this camera in August 2004 and have never regretted it. The Kodak DX7440 is my first digital camera. It takes excellent pictures and is very easy to use. The auto function fullfills the majority of my needs, but I had fun using the more advanced features as well. I posted a couple of pictures to the Amazon online gallery to show the quality when used by a beginner. It made me feel like a pro.<br /><br />I had one small problem. While the camera LCD screen framed the subject accurately, the viewfinder did not. It was slightly off, so I chopped off the top of most pictures. This problem may be a flaw in my particular camera, but check it out if you want to save your battery life by using the viewfinder instead of the LCD.","I got this camera for Christmas 2004.  I immediately began snapping pictures with it.  It takes excellent pictures.  I had an earlier Kodak model that doesn't even compare to this.  The pictures are crisp and clear.  It is not a problem if people are moving around like it was with my old Kodak digital camera.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  It is very easy to use also.","I bought this camera for myself right before christmas and am very happy with it. I've taken over 1000 pictures and find the quality at all the different settings to be exceptional. Battery life is excellent (about 2 hours to charge and last well over 200 pics at high res) and I carry it everywhere I go. Movie mode is awesome and with sound makes for great memories when \"filming\" holiday events. It's connectivity to your TV is simple and straight forward for family veiwing. I bought the 256mg card and that's good for almost 15 minutes of video. With just a few minutes of video the card will still hold a few hundred pictures. I can't imagine this camera not being more then what most point and shot photographers will ever need. And even those who really into photography should find this camera pretty useful. It's goes from full auto to full manual and anything inbetween and I had fun learning what all the different settings would do. It's 4x optical zoom works really well and even going to full digital zoom renders some pretty good shots (you must be very steady or have a tripod or sit it on something that doesn't move however to keep from blurring the image). I only hope that 4 or 5 years down the line when I want to get a new one that the DX 7440 is still available so I can buy it again. I really like this camera!<br /><br />update 5 Mar 05: The little plastic battery latch broke. The battery/memory card door does however hold it inplace so it's still functioning normally. I'm keeping the camera, because it works so well i'm afraid to give it up for a replacement. I carry this camera on my person 24/7 and just passed my 6000th picture. This camera still rocks, but i wanted anyone considering a purchase to be aware of the latch problem.<br /><br />update 5 June 05: Just took a motorcycle trip to Niagara Fall and south through W. Virginia. This camera performed flawlessly (Did i say this camera rocks?). The battery latch problem hasn't effected anything and the pictures I took from this trip turned out excellent (100% of them)!!","I did a lot of research before buying this camera. The fact that it had the option of connecting lenses and filters via an adapter, and that is had basically full manual override sold it to me.<br /><br />The camera is fantastic. The picture and color quality is amazing. I have used several brands of digital cameras and this camera and kodak have been the best. The 4mp let's you crop a lot out of a picture and still maintain picture quality and focus.<br /><br />For those not interested in the complex features it is very simple to use for the average person. The preset modes are more than I have ever seen in a camera. Plus, you can have unlimited video with sound until the memory card fills. Not only that, there is a setting for higher quality video than what your standard digital camera will do. Almost like having a older digital video camera as well!<br /><br />The lens attachments are fantastic (and not as expensive as another reviewer stated - about $50 each). I was very leary about them, but the telephoto lens doubles the zoon, and the wide angle is definitely wide angle doubling that as well.<br /><br />A fantastic camera!<br /><br />Update: After using the camera the only complaint I have is that you havet o watch the way you hold the camera when using the flash. I tend to hold it in a way that I block part of the flash and darken a corner of my photos. I'm going to have to be more concious of holding the camera. However, still the best camera I have ever used, and I love it!","This is my first digital camera, and if it's easy for me to use, it's easy for you to use.  The picture quality is awesome, different scenes are easy to use, the large LCD is cool too.  The battery doesn't last too long, my advice is buy a second battery and have it charged up and ready.  I also advise buying the printer dock.  It's so easy to use, the pictures look better than WalMart.  You can only print 4x6 pictures, I'm not an 8x10 fan so that is just fine for me.  Both camera and printer dock are so small, both will fit in the large Kodak camera bag for vacations.  I'd recommend it to anyone.","I spent a week reviewing all cameras and it came down to two the ones with good price and quality.So i had to pick  i got this camera for a gift i opened it up to see if it's<br /><br />as good as people say and to charge the battery.wow man wow<br /><br />this was easy to use with out a manual this is one awsome camera the pic is a little fuz at first but in time camera got better knock on wood i got a good camera this gift amazed and impressed Everyone with the pictures and the video yah video like a camcorder the rec time is not as long but the camera that can do both great pics and vids is wow and for the price wow again.You can find cameras like this but be ready to pay big bucks yah 300 is not cheap but the camera is not little cheap piece of junk ether and you get what you pay so make count and thats the bottom line.","This camera takes awesome pictures in the daytime. However, at night in my home, I saw poor performance from the flash particularly when you zoom in.  I had multiple shots that were too dark or blurry even some when the subject was about 6 feet away.  It was kind of hit or miss if the shot was awesome using the flash.  These bad shots occured with two regular lamps on in the evening. I just wish Kodak would have beefed up the flash and added a light assist for focusing.  If so, this would have been my favorite.  The movie mode is excellent.<br /><br />I decided to return it and get a cannon A85.  This kodak camera lacks picbridge, manual focus, white balance in auto, beam focus assist for low light focusing, memory is on bottom (bad for tripod shooting), must use kodak lithium ion battery (cannon uses AA's).  The cannon flash is much better than the kodak and I am more satified.  The video mode on the 7440 is superior to the A85, but for pictures, the A85 rocks.<br /><br />Giving it 4 stars in generous, should have been 3.","We did a lot of research before we purchased this camera, and we are so glad we did. This camera is awesome!!!It takes great pictures and it's super easy to use. I would highly recommend it!","I'm not joking about the stock. This is my second Kodak EasyShare camera. My first was a basic EasyShare CX4310, which is a sturdy digital point-and-shoot. After a year of digital photography, I wanted two things in an upgrade: zoom, which is easy to find, and fast shutter speed, which is not.<br /><br />Most digital cameras have significant shutter lag. You press the button and tell people to just keep smiling, really. By the time you get the shot, they've started looking elsewhere or the smiles have faded into irritation or the photo is just a blur of movement. I went to several local electronics stores and experimented with display models (often putting in my own media card so I could examine the photos later) before making a final decision.<br /><br />There are plenty of cameras with more megapixels, but I feel comfortable in saying NONE below $900 with a comperable shutter speed. I didn't want a digital SLR. If you whip out a huge camera at parties, people flinch. I wanted something both fast and discreet, something I could carry in my pocket and whip out the second anything intersting happened without having to stage a shot.<br /><br />The Kodak EasyShare DX7440 lives up to all my expectations. If it did nothing more than take fast, clear photos, I would be thrilled, but it is loaded with other features I appriciate.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* The 16 built in presets work beautifully. I've been very pleased with the results ranging from \"Sports\" to \"Self Portrait.\"<br /><br />* If you don't like their presets, you can make your own settings very easily.<br /><br />* This camera is great for a whole family. Point and shoot people can just leave it on \"auto.\" More advanced photographers can set fstop and aperature settings manually. I particularly appriciate that Kodak made seperate controls for the dummy and pro settings. A little wheel in the upper right corner controls manual settings, so if your point-and-shoot spouse picks up the camera, they don't lose your settings OR take lousy pictures and wonder why you broke the camera.<br /><br />* The preview screen on back is HUGE, making it very easy to frame shots.<br /><br />* You can change aspect ratios on the camera itself, so instead of shooting at 4x5 (equilivent of an 8x10 photo) you can set it to shoot at 2x3 (equilivent of a 4x6 photo). This means less cropping and photo editing later. This feature is espically nice if you have a printer dock and want to print straight from your camera.<br /><br />* The video feature works shockingly well. Set it to video, press the button once, and it will film until you fill up your memory card or you press the same button, telling it to stop. You don't have to hold down the shutter the whole time, which is a major bonus. The video quality is about average, with surprisingly good sound pickup. The ability to simply plug the camera into a TV using standard cables is *wonderful.* I never thought I'd want something like this, but now I'll be disapointed if I ever lose it.<br /><br />* Burst mode works very well.<br /><br />* Zoom is smooth and fast. You can set it to either flow organically or to hop to 1x, 2x, etc.<br /><br />* The interface software is hands-down the best in the business. You don't have to \"learn\" a Kodak camera. They are very intuitively designed. Other manufacturers could learn something from studying their interface.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* The presets are easy to access, but just as easy to accidentally switch while in the process of taking a photo. Several pictures intended for party mode have ended up in \"Night Landscape.\" They were partially salvagable with color correction software, but still pretty unsatisfactory.<br /><br />* The camera loses the time and date settings every time you remove the battery. If you have a charging dock, this probably isn't an issue, but for those of us who charge the battery seperately, it gets annoying very fast.<br /><br />* Like most digital cameras, people complain about the brightness of the flash. As a photographer, I'd say they use just enough, but as a subject, it can be painfully blinding. This is all the more reason to take action shots rather than lining people up for posed photos.<br /><br />All in all, I love this camera and expect to use it for years to come. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality pocket sized digital camera.","I had a friend with this camera who was happy with it, and read the many good reviews here, so I pulled the trigger and bought a DX7440 after a few weeks of research. I now regret it.<br /><br />Pictures are often over exposed indoors. Also, you have to manually reset the camera's clock and calendar every time you re-charge the battery (not so with my old Canon). I also get lots of soft focused pictures. I do love the camera's quick shutter - there is virtually no shutter lag. This isn't a bad camera, but 2/5 pictures don't turn out because of the exposure/soft focus issues. Also, the color saturation is better with my old Canon - at least to mey eye.","This Kodak is an almost perfect combo of memory, megpixs, and convenience.  The camera comes with a load of internal memory which most users will find is all they need. Of course, the docking station - my main reason for buying Kodak - is wonderfully convenient. I use this professionally and the docking is the only way to go.<br /><br />Complaints: the software is a little wierd and keeps running in the background on my computer - not intuitive as to how to manage photo folders. I would rather make my own folders, thanks.<br />Also, the power and USB cable connections to the docking station are crumby. Finally, not clear how to replay saved videos (I get about 45 seconds).  Otherwise pictures are great and handy to use.<br /><br />_________________<br /><br />Update June 2008 - can't believe I am still using this thing professionally and personally 4 years later. My glowing review above stands. The only concern I have is that the function selector dial is getting a little crabby and may jamb up on me soon, otherwise not a problem has been had. Highly recommended, and not sure I have seen much else out there that is going to offer that much in competition with this model.","This camera is the best!  I upgraded from a 3-yr-old Olympus 3MP/2X zoom to this 4MP/4X zoom, but the best thing about the upgrade is how fast it is.  It has an internal memory that is used as a temporary hard drive, and taking pictures is instantaneous.  I think the specs on Kodak.com say it takes 0.2 seconds to take picture after picture (to up to about 6 or so pics in a row manually), and only 1.2 seconds from turning the camera on to taking a picture.  I can vouch for that personally.  You can literally circle the room, taking pictures like a gunslinger.<br /><br />Don't let the \"Professional\" grade scare you off.  Just put it on auto and go.  If you want fine tune your pics, it has 16 modes you can use, like sand, night landscape, night portrait, etc.<br /><br />It also uses a lithium ion battery, similar to what camcorders use.  It even comes with its own charger.  I know you might prefer AA rechargable types, but lithium ion lasts a lot longer.  And besides, if you don't use the viewfinder to take pictures (since it's unnecessary) your battery will literally last months between charges.  So if you are going on vacation, just charge it up before you go.  No worries.<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting the 5MP/3X Zoom that Kodak also sells, which I was also considering, then realize that a zoom level is equal to about a MP.  4MP by itself is plenty, unless you're making posters, and the extra zoom lets you focus on what you want, and helps to eliminate cropping later.<br /><br />The USB plug & software works like a charm.  Even if you don't use the software, my Windows XP automatically recognizes the camera as another hard drive, in my case, the \"J\" hard drive.  Then just cut and paste.  Some people might complain about the low budget photo editing software, which lets you get rid of red-eye, and do some cropping, and that's about it, but if you want something fancy, then go out and get some $50 software that will do everything.  Don't let that keep you from getting this camera.  The charger that comes included is worth $50 by itself.<br /><br />The camera looks bigger based on its pics, but it's actually quite small and light, and will easily fit in a pants pocket.<br /><br />The bottom line is there is nothing I would change about this camera.  Every time I use it I literally say, \"I love this camera.\"  I was very pleased with the photo quality from my old Olympus, but I'm a die-hard Kodak user now.  Don't forget about how fast it is!  Nothing's more frustrating than missing out on a great picture because your camera's too slow.","I've owned many digicams, and this one is the best! I've had Olympus, Canon, Toshiba, and Sony cameras... this is the first one I've LOVED both the camera and the capability! I've even downgraded from my 5 MP camera for the shutter speed and better zoom.<br /><br />Pros: The shutter is very fast, MUCH faster than any previous camera. It turns on quickly, and shoots fast. The pictures are great 95% of the time (not in love with the macro mode, though). There are many different scene presets, like museum (where the sound and flash are turned off), Party (red-eye reduction on), etc, etc. There are on screen prompts that tell you when you might want to use each mode. VERY VERY user friendly. It has a neat \"favorites\" mode, that saves a smaller copy of favorite pics on the camera so you can use it as a sort of album, one touch easy. Very cool. The shot-to-review time is lightening fast. I LOVE this camera, if you can't tell.<br /><br />Cons: If you have picture preview, and are using the screen to frame shots, the delay is sort of long. (Just use the optical viewfinder to avoid this problem.) The macro mode.. didn't like that preset. Did better getting further away and zooming, but that changes the depth of focus. Need to figure out the manual settings that work for this. Battery life wasn't great: I got about 100 pics, but that's why I always buy a back-up. I'm hard on batteries. Use the LCD all the time, show lots of people the shots, etc. Although the batteries are proprietary, they're not too crazy expensive: less then $25 here.<br /><br />I thought about the higher resolution DX7640 (6MP, 3x optical zoom), but a manual lens cap? Are they insane? I'm as lazy as the day is long, and would either never put it on, or lose it right away, and end up with a scratched/useless lens very quickly.<br /><br />I haven't tried the EasyShare stuff, like the dock for the computer and the printer, but some might find this nice. The pictures this camera takes are well worth printing, that's for sure, but I use online printing.<br /><br />This camera has reinstilled my love of taking photos (note: not photography.. I'm definately not a pro, just a consumer that wants to document puppies and children before they become dogs and adults). The difference a short shutter lag makes is HUGE for me...<br /><br />As a rank novice, point-and-shoot person I am, I can't tell you about the advantages of the more advanced features. But apparently the PASM can be advantage, if you're smarter than me. For me, I shoot, upload, crop, email and/or print.<br /><br />I would also like to recommend Photoshop Album for those that are getting into digital photos. It integrates well with this camera, and allows you to keep all your photos much better organized. In my years of digital photography, I've accumulated about 4000 photos... without Album, it'd be near impossible to find particular photos.","I chose this as my second camera in a rush because my HP \"fell ill\" after 3 years (that was a good camera also). I could've never made a better choice. I have so much creative control with the focus, zoom, color, lighting and all other choices that I had never had before. This camera gives you the ability to be as artistic in your photos as you want. The photos come out clear and big and as someone said in a previous review, their original resolution gives you a large enough size to work with. The 16 set scenes give you even more creative control, there is one for anything you dream of taking pictures of.<br /><br />The software is easy to install and transfer is very simple. I had the box open, battery in and had taken the first few pictures all within 5 minutes of buying it. Battery life is about 45 minutes before you need to recharge (takes about 3 hours or less depending on how much you want it charged). This camera even gives you a snapshot sound (which you can change to music) each time you turn it on or take a picture. The pictures take incredibly fast. You can literally shoot in the moment, not 2 seconds from the moment. The 2.2 inch screen is also a good size to work with. I've found no problems with it at all.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone, beginners and intermediates alike. It will put the life into your photography. You'll never want to stop taking pictures! For the price and the artistic freedom, this would be your best choice, you won't regret it!","After weeks of online reviews and talking to camera stores I selected the Kodak DX7440. The camera takes excellent pictures and the software that comes with it is EXTREMELY easy to load and use (sorry Microsoft). For the money and for someone that wants a good easy to use point and shoot camera, this is the one.","This is my second digital camera, so I shopped around very carefully and chose this one. I haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />One thing I really like is that it is relatively easy to hold and handle--not like some of those super compact cameras that are so popular now. The DX7440 has a nice hand grip, and the controls are all very accessible.<br /><br />This camera is also very FAST. Many digital camera have an awkward shutter lag. This camera focuses very very fast, and there is no discernible shutter lag. Look at the specifications and compare to other cameras!<br /><br />The \"automatic\" picture-taking setting work great with no worries and excellent quality, but if you're ambitious, there are lots of manual controls available like aperture priority and shutter priority and etc.<br /><br />The zoom lens is wonderful; 4x is better than the 3x on most cameras in this price range, and it zooms in very fast and smooth. 4x zoom is actually more powerful than the more expensive Kodak DX7630, with 3x zoom.<br /><br />4 megapixels allows plenty of room for cropping your shots and still retaining good quality.<br /><br />I just got a set of photos back from Winkflash, an on-line photo lab, and the picture quality is excellent for 4x6 snapshots.<br /><br />Battery life is quite good. I went for a 4-day camping trip and filled up an entire 512 mb memory card without running out of juice. That's with the supplied battery, and a longer-lasting one is available for $24 on Amazon.<br /><br />The extra-large LCD screen is also much better than most of the competition, and can be viewed even in bright sunlight.<br /><br />On a Macintosh, you do not have to use the Kodak software. The camera interfaces fine with mac's Iphoto software. The Mac X image capture software allows for downloading movies.<br /><br />You can shoot movies in 640 by 480, double the resolution of most cameras.<br /><br />I bought a 32x high speed 512 mb Lexar Sd card, which works fine--although apparently there is only a minimal advantage to a high-speed card, and Kodak does not recommend them.<br /><br />For a camera case, I highly recommend the Lowepro D-Res 10AW. The DX74440 fits PERFECTLY, with room for a battery and spare memory card. The case is well-designed, well-padded, and compact.<br /><br />For the range of features, ease of use, and price, the DX7440 can't be beat!","This incredible 4.0 mega pixel camera comes with an amazingly big and high-resolution 2.2\" TFT screen and is equipped with a fabulous professional-quality SCHNEIDER-KREUZNACH VARIOGON lens, capable of 4X optical zoom, which is - in my opinion - very impressive. The camera is compact and very aesthetic, easy and comfortable to use. It has excellent features, such as the very smart and useful \"Share\" button, 16 programmed scene modes, 5 color modes (low color, natural color, high color, black & white and sepia) and 2 movie modes. You can also choose image resolution out of five options: 1.1 MP, 2.1 MP, 3.1 MP, 3.5 MP and 4.0 MP.<br /><br />The camera also includes manual and custom controls. You can choose between auto mode (camera sets settings for you), scenes mode, program mode, aperture priority mode, shutter priority mode, manual mode and custom mode.<br /><br />A feature which I found helpful is the image-rotating sensor, which automatically rotates the vertical image once it's taken. It saves you the trouble of doing it yourselves with an image-editing program.<br /><br />The important feature that this camera offers, aside from many more terrific options it has, is the \"Share\" button, that allows you to tag pictures for printing and for emailing, and later when you connect the camera to your computer it can do that immediately - according to the software settings. The software is not the best I've seen, but still it's pretty good (of course, there's lots of room for improvement). I personally don't like it very much, but it helps you organize your pictures and it also has some minor editing options that help you make corrections in your images to achieve the result you want. Once the camera is connected to the computer, the software wizard pops up and helps you transfer the pictures from the camera to the computer. Also, you must work with this software in order to create an email address book and then transfer it to the camera so that you will be able to tag the pictures. For instance, if you have Friend 1 and Friend 2 in your address book, you can do the tagging so that the image will be sent to Friend 1 when the camera is connected to the computer.<br /><br />I am generally very satisfied with the camera, and it surprised me big time when I got it with some awesome things that I didn't expect to see. The camera delivers stunning pictures at an excellent quality. The pictures are sharp and detailed, colors are accurate and the result is as good as promised. The first few pictures I took with this camera didn't turn out very successful, but since these were my first ones and I hadn't known how to use the camera fully, the camera is not to blame. The last few pictures I took are stunning.<br /><br />I have a 256 MB SanDisk memory card. With an empty card like this I can shoot a video in 640x480 mode in the length of 13:55 minutes. You can also choose the 320x240 movie-shooting mode, which allows you to make a 24:28-minute long movie. That's a very good thing that I haven't seen so far in the cameras I know. The video comes out very good, but the thing I was disappointed about is you cannot use the camera zoom while shooting a video.<br /><br />The menus are nicely designed, have lots of options and let you choose and control quite about everything.<br /><br />One thing that I found lacking is the way the mode dial is built. \"Video\" and \"Favorites\" are both located behind \"OFF\", and that means that you have to turn off the camera first and then turn it back on to get to these.<br /><br />I have owned it for a pretty short time, but already impressed a lot from it, but then again haven't fully figured out how to use all the smart advanced features it has to offer. I bought my camera for 283 dollars, and I think this camera is a great value for this amount of money.<br /><br />The camera comes with a Lithium-Ion rechargeable battery (isn't it much better than those AA batteries?) that takes about two hours to recharge, and all the necessary accessories, plus the EasyShare Software CD and a manual book that explains the basic things you need to know about the camera and the way to use it. The book is very helpful, and helps you learn what you need to know.<br /><br />Plus, the fantastic Kodak website offers all the support you need (and if you lost your book you can find it there and read all of its contents on the web!), advices for taking pictures and using your digital camera, and of course if you want to buy and haven't decided yet, just go to the camera page, where you'll find everything you want to know: detailed camera specifications, larger views, camera demo, package contents, features highlight and system requirements. I highly recommend visiting the Kodak website.<br /><br />I would recommend the camera to anyone. It's simple and easy to use on one hand (you just turn the camera on auto mode, take as many pictures as you like and then press the \"review\" button to see them); but it's professional and has many options and qualities on the other hand, and that allows the advanced user to produce great images maximizing the camera's abilities. The camera also has an option for a date stamp for those who don't want to forget when the image was taken.<br /><br />Summary: Superb camera, except one weakness - the software. Apart from that, I must say I'm really pleased with this camera. You get your money's worth.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Printer Dock / Printer Dock 6000 (you might want to wait for the new model, Printer Dock Plus) would be a perfect addition. The Camera Dock would also be a nice thing to have.","This is a full featured yet easy to use camera that takes excellent quality pictures and has a high quality 4x optical zoom lens.<br /><br />It is extremely fast in focusing and taking pictures, and the focus is almost always perfect. It has a large number of preset settings for circumstances like landscape, portrait, close up etc, but has manual options as well where the enthusiast can set all the settings. It has a burst mode to take pictures rapidly and the ability to take 3 bracketed exposures to get just the right one. The shutter can be set for as long as 64 seconds, for long exposure shots of dark scenes.<br /><br />The image quality, which is where cameras must perform, is really excellent. There are setting to adjust the sharpness and color saturation to the users choice, so if one wants more muted colors they can be obtained. The usual 'normal' setting though provides rich perfect color. I've taken over a 1000 pictures on this camera to date and have been delighted in the quality of the vast majority--any problems have been the photographers, not the camera! The color reproduction is perfect both indoors and out. Kodak cameras tend to give pictures with high color saturation, but as mentioned, this can be toned down in one of the settings if desired. I like the saturation as it is--looks vibrant and lifelike. The 4 megapixel size is plenty--I've had 8x10 prints made that look identical to film.<br /><br />Battery life is excellent. The flash is powerful for indoor shots, and it's power can also be adjusted by one of the settings. It is easy to use--the settings are intuitive and the controls are easy to use and easy to find on the camera.<br /><br />The price for this is also great--making it a stand out deal in the 4 megapixel, 4x zoom lens category.<br /><br />Highly recommended--easy enough to use by a novice, but has more than enough settings and features for a more expert user.","PROS: Easy of use, 16 scene modes, large LCD display, rechargable battery, burst shooting mode, unlimited movie mode<br /><br />CON: Above average noise in picture, flash too concentrated in center area, blurring on the edges.<br /><br />I went shopping for a 4MP digital camera and the final candidates were: Kodak DX7440, Canon S410, and Nikon 4200. In comparison, Kodak DX7440 has a great form when holding with right hand, large LCD, very easy to use, lots of features. It's also cheaper than theother two products by about $100. So it's a great value. I took some photos in the show room, and with the larger LCD (2.2') display the Kodak DX7440 seem to have pretty good picture when comparing to the other LCD displays (1.8').<br /><br />So I bought it. But when I uploaded the pictures I took onto the computer and blow it up using Windows XP picture viewer, I see significant amount of noise in the photo. The edges of objects were a little blurry. In the past, my relatives/friends have emailed me picture fromtheir comparable Canon and Nikon cameras, that's when I realize the picture quality on the Kodak isn't as great.<br /><br />I like all the cool features the Kodak DX7440 can offer, some of which the rival models don't even have, but for me where it counts is the picture quality.<br /><br />So if you only look to take picture and print it out to 3x5 or 5x7 photo paper, then the noise would not matter as much, and all the features the dx7440 offer is definitely a plus. But if you are looking to blow the photo to its full size 11x14 or enlarge it as your computer screen saver, then it will be a factor in your decision.","I have been using my new dX7440 for about two months now.  I agree with the other user that the movie mode is a blast!!!  the TV-quality of the movie is just wonderful and I have a 512 MB secure digital card that stores up to 24 minutes of movies in the highest resolution of this DX7440 movie mode.<br /><br />Most of the time, I use the \"auto\" mode to take still pictures.  The colors are not satuated.  I don't quite understand why there is another review that suggests the otherwise.  The trick is that, one has to press the shutter button half-way for half a second, let the computer chip analyze the brightness, colour pattern and speed of the object BEFORE totally pressing the shutter button all the way down and take the picture.  Try it, and you get a much improved results.<br /><br />When you take pictures in \"auto\" mode, the huge 2.2 inches LCD screen shows where the focus is with a pair of squares.  If you are taking picture of a moving object, the computer chip senses it and automatically traces the object; this is some high-tech feature!<br /><br />You can also use manual mode to select your own focus point.  This comes in very handy.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this Kodak DX7440.  I have owned a SONY, Fuji cameras.  One was 3.2 Megapixel, the other was 2.0 Megapixel.  In no way, can those two cameras' quality matches the Kodak's.  You don't have to take my word for it, try it yourself.  This [the Kodak] is the BMW or Lexus in digital photography!!<br /><br />I have one suggestion for Kodak though, the flip-door on the side of the camera where the USB connector is, is hard to open.  I think that using a hard plastic door will fix this.  However, this is just pretty minor.<br /><br />After I installed the software, I connected the camera to the computer with the USB cable and it automatically uploaded the pictures and movies at once.<br /><br />One can use the Kodak software to enlarge photos and zoom left and right.  This is pretty good.  One can also adjust contrast, brightness, make black-and-white photos, cut unnecessary parts, etc.  One can even download from Kodak for a better software and have more editing features.<br /><br />I have also considered the new SONY 4.0 megapixel with full movie mode camera, I forgot about its model number.  Anyway, it is not important, I've found that the SONY's picture was kind of fake and the movie mode doesn't provide enough anti-handshake power.  The Kodak is definiety better.<br /><br />If I would ever consider buying digital cameras, I would only consider either SONY and KODAK, I wouldn't consider any other brand, not even CANON.  Last time, Sony won.  This time, the Kodak DX7440 wins hands down!!!<br /><br />If BMW is the \"Ultimate Driving Machine\", the KODAK is the \"Ultimate Picture Taking Machine\" !!  Forget about other brands.","I bought this camera after reading many glowing reviews (here and elsewhere) and was prepared to love it. And there's a lot to like:<br /><br />* Ergonomically, it's fantastic -- fits well in my hand, mechanical controls are firm and snappy and well-placed.<br /><br />* LCD screen is super-large and bright<br /><br />* Very fast, almost no shutter lag<br /><br />* High quality lens<br /><br />* Works well as an automatic point-and-shoot camera<br /><br />* Offers lots of manual controls if you want do things yourself<br /><br />* Menus are well-designed and very easy to use<br /><br />BUT... the colors it produces seem garish and unnatural. I imagine they've done this on purpose, because a lot of people are attracted by brilliant, strong colors, but I found it off-putting. I'd prefer to have the colors in my pictures actually represent the colors in whatever I'm shooting.<br /><br />So I ended up returning the Kodak DX7440 and getting a Pentax Optio S4i instead. The Pentax doesn't match all of the Kodak's good features (it's not quite as good ergonomically, has a less powerful flash, and offers less manual control) but its color rendition is more natural, and it's super-compact size means I can carry it in a pocket and literally take it anywhere without a second thought.<br /><br />If the Kodak didn't produce such overblown colors, I would have had a very hard time giving it up. It's got a lot going for it, but in the end, I just didn't like the pictures it produces.","I have received this Kodak new digital camera DX7440 for two weeks. The lithum-ion battery and charger that come with the camera are nice extras. The 32MB memory is enough for 20 pictures or about 1.5 minutes movie in highest resolution.<br /><br /> I love the movie mode right away. The camera also record sounds, I filmed my cousin's birthday party with a brand new 256 MB secure digital memory card. We connected the camera to the big screen 42\" TV and it was a moment of blast!! We laughed and enjoyed every moment of it. It captured a lot of details and it seemed that the camera erased a lot of my hand movements and shaking; i.e. stabilizer. The sound recorded was good as well.<br /><br /> Man, the pictures are wonderful. We went to the dark backyard at evening time, played hide and seek, and the viewfinder lighted up and I saw everybody in the viewfinder even though it was very dark.<br /><br /> The flash light worked excellent in dark as well and the pictures turned out great no matter day or night. The 4X optical zoom was amazing, better than my other friends' 3X; and the viewfinder was big measured at 2.2 inches wide.<br /><br /> The joystick was fun to play with, it controls a lot of things, such as when reviewing your pictures and you like to zoom to an area and enlarge it. The camera lets you zoom to 8X as big when reviewing pictures. Man, you see a lot and a lot of details. And, the quality is so amazing!!!<br /><br /> I am so much in love with this light-weight Kodak that I want to enjoy its full extend by purchasing the camera printer dock and print pictures myself. As of this writing, I am waiting for the printer dock. I will give you an update soon.<br /><br /> Man, this is one heck of a digital camera. Kodak, you did it! Highly recommended.<br /><br /> --------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Update One (8/6/2004):<br /><br /> Later found that the CD that comes with the camera contains interactive tutorials about how to use the camera, how to email photos, how to printer photos, etc. Nice!!<br /><br /> Just got our 10\"X8\" photots ordered from Ofoto.com, the pictures look perfect, no distortion, vivid and true colors. We even got our first 10 free 4\"X6\" prints. Wonderful!! I know that its capable of getting up to 20\"X30\". Yet, we don't have room for that big a picture yet.<br /><br /> My Kodak Printer Dock has just arrived. It automatically recharges the battery, nice!! Emailing pictues to friends and relatives is just one touch away after inputting email addresses. It's so very easy!!!<br /><br /> ----------------------------------------------------------------<br />Update two (8/9/2004):<br /><br />  The camera comes with 10 4\"X6\" free printer dock photo paper, the printer dock also comes with another 10 free 4\"X6\" photo papaer.  I printed 5 of my pictures; since Kodak says that the printer automatically laminates prints, I put one of them in a bowl of water and see.  I got up the next morning and picked up that picture from the water, the pictures was still intact.  The lamination was perfect and make the picture free of weather attack.  Still, one has to keep the picture from direct sunlights, but at least it is free from moisture attack and finger prints.  This is an advantage over other print sources for 4\"x6\"s.<br /><br />The quality of the prints are also great, with true colors and sharp clarity; just as how they look from the viewfinder.<br /><br />Some of my friends ask if there is another Kodak that may be about the same quality, functionality, but cheaper.  I also suggest the LS743, which also let you take 4.0 Megapixel photos and TV-quality movies with sound.  I think that that one is slightly cheaper from Amazon.com.  Yet, that one has a slightly smaller viewfinder and 1X less zoom (3X instead of 4X of the DX7440).<br /><br />Also, taking movie seems easier than using the camcorders.  The advantage is that it is smaller and lighter, making it easier to carry around and my hand does not get tried fast.  The quality is already TV-quality, which is the same as the camcorders.<br /><br />The disadvantage is that the battery does not last as long as the camcorders as theirs are heavier and bigger.  And, movie length is limited by the size of your memory card.  So, you may need a bigger card to take longer movies.  Yet, memory card prices are getting cheaper and cheaper; and battery lives are getting longer and longer.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is the camera for all the photo and movie needs, with ease of use and handy features, especially big viewfinder, TV-quality movie functionality so one can occaionally take movie for memory.  My other friends are surprised by its various abilities and quality.","The Kodak DX7440 is a near perfect combination of features and ease of use.  The 2.2\" viewfinder is great for framing shots both inside and outside and the 4x zoom gets you a little closer than most cameras in its class.  The ergonomics of the camera are also a plus.  It fits comfortably in my hand and the dial and joystick are very easy to use.  The Kodak DX7440 produces vivid colors that other digital cameras just can't match and the images are much sharper than the Canon I previously owned.<br />For the beginner photographer, it has a full auto mode and a number of special scene modes to help take great pictures.  For the intermediate photographer, it has PASM modes which give you even more creative control.  The movie mode is better than most cameras, but if you really want to make movies, you should probably get a camcorder.<br />I have only 2 complaints about the DX7440 - the lack of a superfine compression mode and the use of a proprietary battery.  However, neither of these issues are too big of a deal.  Hopefully Kodak will release a firmware update at some point in the future to address the superfine compression.  I ended up buying 2 backup Li-Ion batteries so that should not be an issue in the future.<br />In conclusion, I would recommend this camera to any beginner or intermediate photographer who wants a camera that is simple and fun to use.","I had been looking for a digital camera to carry around for special events instead of lugging around my 35mm.  I researched all kinds of cameras.  Sure there are more expensive cameras that probably do more, but for the average picture taker this is a winner!!!! I used it right out of the box; without using instructions. This is my first digital camera too!  I took pictures of fireworks with the special night mode for fireworks and they turned out great.  Also the video part is great too!  It will go as long as your memory card holds out.  I purchased an additional 256 mb memory card.  It comes with a charger so you don't have to buy a camera dock unless you want to.  The batteries really hold up.  I went a week and took numerous pictures and decided to charge it just in case.  I love this little camera.  The color in the pictures are great and I even put it on night mode and took a picture in the dark and the flash lit up the whole room and I got my picture.  Kodak you definitely have a winner in my book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"]},{"name":"Kodak DCS Pro SLR/c","amazon_reviews":["Cons:<br />1. For my uses the only con on this camera is that a fully charged battey only lasts about 15 minutes using the lcd screen to review pics I've taken, and using the autofocus feature. For some reason, these two functions are battery drainers, but I can't see using the camera without them. I should mention it took some reading of the manual to find the autofocus set lever on the front of the camera to the left of the lens and the + setting on the top of the camera on the left side.<br />2. This camera is best at low iso settings. I use it at iso-100 or less. Best is iso-80 for daylight or for flash. For long exposures it has extended low iso of iso-25 for exposures of 2 to 30 seconds, iso-12 for exposures of 4 to 30 seconds, and iso-6 for exposures of 8 to 30 seconds.<br />3. This is a complicated camera. To learn to use it I had to refer to the manual a number of times. I'm not one to read a manual cover to cover, but for me the manual as a reference to figure out basic functions such as white balance, iso, auto focus, using the timer, etc. was needed.<br />4. There is no live view on the lcd screen. To take a pic you need to use the view finder. However the lcd does let you review pics you have just taken with no problem.<br />5. The camera uses a 1GB memory card. For me this is no problem as that is enough for 70 raw files, and extra cards are cheap. And with the low battery life, I'm not going to fill a card up anyway. I use this camera for still lifes, and landscapes, so I don't generally shoot more than 20 or 30 shots on a session.<br />Pros:<br />1. The price. I bought my DCS Pro 14-N about 15 months ago on ebay for $425. It came with two batteries. I spent another $95 on ebay for a used combination battery charger and AC adapter.I wasn't ready to spend $850 for a used Nikon D600 or $1500 for a used Nikon D750. If I'm still around when these cameras or the D810 hit the used market for $400 or less, I'll snap one up in a hurry. When this camera was released in 2002 it sold for more than $4,000.<br />1. As mentioned above, base iso of 80 and extended low iso of 6, 12 and 25 is a big plus for shooting noise free vibrant colors.<br />2. The camera sensor is CCD rather than CMOS.

I wanted a full frame camera to get the full benefit of my Sigma 15-30mm wide angle lens. And the camera will autofocus with the lens.<br />4. 14MP is not too shabby, even by today's standards. And the pixels on the sensor are 64um, twice as large as any of the current Nikon full frame dslr's.<br />5. The Kodak website still supports it with manuals and Kodak DCS Photo desk software which works on all windows versions (I've had it on XP and Win 8.1) to view and process the DCS raw files. And Photoshop will open the raw files as well.<br />6. It takes great pics. See attached with the Sigma 15-30mm lens. The flower is at 30mm, 1/60 sec, iso-80, f9.5.

Because I have restricted the camera to studio use, it's only failure is of little consequence to me.  A full charge on the OEM battery is worth about fifty (maybe fifty-three) shots.

They provide extra light for focusing etc. I don't know when they are activated, or if I can turn it off.<br />---<br />I have some sample images for you here.<br />All handheld on a grey spring evening in Sweden.<br />[...] this page.<br />Problems<br />I dislike using flash, as a result indoor images turn up dark.<br />Some are VERY dark with the automatic setting in spite of normal illumination.<br />I somewhat enhanced this by increasing ISO to 200.<br />Still not as good as my Olympus D-550 (C-300) in low light. I feel it necessery to switch between ISO modes for indoor and outdoor shots. Requires clicking in the menu.<br />The G600 wants to use flash at all times indoors. Flash make the pictures flat and boring. I want to capture atmosphere, not cold hard vectors.<br />---<br />The Automatic \"focus depth\" was very tight.<br />If I focus on my face, the eyes look great but the nose gets blurry. (My nose isn't huge). I am not sure how to compensate for this. (still learning)<br />In macro mode this is apparent when shooting a fat larva where half the larva is out of focus. Unless you only photograph coins... this is a problem.<br />---<br />In the evening, the automatic light control make the images a tad less bright and less in contrast than real life. Increasing brightness and contrast +25 and +25 in Pshop helps evening pictures.<br />I suspect this can be adjusted in the white balance settings.<br />Much of this can be compensated for, with internal tweaking, once and for all. The colors overall are very natural and life like.<br />---<br />The multi spot autofocus tend to pick the items in the background and not the thing I want to shoot.<br />I saw no reason to use spot metering until I got the G600.<br />---<br />The amount of \"flawed images\" are less than with the Casio, and I think that when I get used to this one it will perform as well as the point and shoot Olympus. I am well on my way.<br />---<br />I would love it if it had a \"speed dial\" to chose<br />between different scene modes.<br />The sound and avi format works very well.<br />16 seconds amount only to 2800 kb.<br />---<br />I'd rather they had two compartments for batteries than two for memory cards. Running out of juice is a bummer when you are to shoot the sunset from the top of a hill.<br />---<br />Some would say that the zoom is too fast.<br />It is, like the Borg would say, ...efficient.<br />---<br />It could be easier to record sound and movies. The menu system requires clicking... clicking...<br />---<br />I need to test the lense and ccd more, with some colorful sunsets, but so far the quality is really nice. I can count individual strains of hair on my head on my images. I'll keep this one, because it is portable and creates great images under the right conditions and decent images under strain.<br />A third battery may be an investment.<br />Manual settings will work out some of my problems.<br />---<br />/Fredrik<br />My free for all, no copyright 1000+ image archive.<br />(Most shot with the Olympus, but that will change.)

They were all entry level cam's from the era, a couple of Fuji's, Kodak's and a Pentax. The Pentax i think might have even been around $400-500 in it's day, so above entry level...but for me the D-395 beat that out, as well.<br /><br />I'm not going into technicals, i don't have the knowledge for that. But put simply, the picture quality for both indoor and outdoor settings is very good...imho. In fact i just did a test of an indoor shot against a current entry level camera, the 12mp Lumix DMC-S1, which sells for around $90 as we speak...and i can honestly tell you the D-395 image quality was MILES ahead. It wasn't even a close contest, the S1 was super grainy in comparison, whereas the D-395 was crisp and clear in low/moderate lighting.<br /><br />As far as the negatives go, the menu won't allow you to save the image setting at the highest quality once you switch it off, which is a bit of an annoyance. It's also a bit of a slow poke between shots, and of course video is very limited and poor by today's standard.<br /><br />Overall though, just for still photos it's a fun and easy to use camera to have a muck around with, and i'm sure you can find it at a giveaway price. And as mentioned, as far as pure image quality goes, i'm sure it will still out shine many of today's entry level digital camera's.","This is a great camera!  It's easy to use and fits in your hand just right.  For the money, it's a great camera.  Sure, you can buy a $600 camera and you're going to get a lot more.  Easy for newbies!!!","I received this camera as a gift nearly four years ago and tho it has since broken, it worked exceptionally well while I had it.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying that this camera takes great photos. Don't let the 3mp limit fool you, it takes very clear and sharp photos for only 3mp's. Plain and simple the photo quality is great, great colors and all.<br /><br />The video I shot on this camera was great, it was a tad bit pixel'y, but still very clear a resolute for a 3mp camera. Again, I recommend this camera for it standard video quality.<br /><br />One thing I did'nt like, however, was the Compact Flash Card slot, an SD slot would have made things simpler, not big deal tho.<br /><br />Another thing I wasn't fond of was the flash time on this camera. It takes about 3-4 seconds to capture the image, and then another 2 seconds to process the image. Quick snap shots are simply impossible with this camera.<br /><br />The AA battery slot was no big deal, I bought rechargeable ones and they worked fine.<br /><br />In short, this camera was good for its time- 2004, and tho some of its features are outdated, its still good as a cheap camera you'd use sparingly.","A good camera for what it offers. I got this camera for less than $50.00. It does eat regular batteries but I started using Lithium and have used the same set for several months now.<br />Other than that it is impossible to find memory cards since this is an older camera.  Stores about 30 pics at the highest level. Not recommended if you don't have somewhere to download your pics. Although my friends are glad they don't have to look at hundreds of pics from my travels ;)<br /><br />This is the only digital camera I've had and I think the pictures are acceptable for a 3mp camera. I don't have the problems that others describe. I've taken this camera on two once in a life time trips and caught breath taking photos.  However I'm realistic and know that it's not a high end camera that will show you the hairs on a dog from 50ft away. You will take pics similar to a disposable 35mm.","takes very nice pictures in ideal lighting conditions. the macro is good as well.<br /><br />would recommend it for a beginner.","My hasband has taken over 5,000 pictures in the past year and a half with this camera.  He has had no problems, which I certainly can't say for my more expensive Fuji piece of crap!  He wishes you could take more pictures consecutively (with no pause between pictures), and wishes the zoom was optical rather than digital, but other than that...he has even been using the same card, and this little camera just keeps on ticking!!!","Well this Camera is near 8 years old now, a veritable antique in the context of digital camera evolution, so why am i writing this review?<br /><br />Well, i recently (very cheaply) bought a bunch of six digital camera's from this era all around 3.2mp, and this one was the clear winner for me as far as all round picture quality goes.

Good points on the D-395: easy to use. Easy to transfer photos to computer or printer. Good color on default settings. Decent features (have not yet explored all of them!).  Small, fits in purse or pocket. Uses AA batteries. Not so good, but fixable points: Small XD card supplied with camera; bought a 128 replacement. Like all digitals, eats batteries; bought rechargeables.  Bad points: No optical zoom. I find the digital zoom to be useless. Shutter button confusing for some, it has different options for simple push or firm hold push - if you hand this camera to a friend to take your picture, they usually won't get the shutter to work on the first try. Have not had much luck with the red-eye reducer, but I use software in my PC to fix it. Other: Description claims photos up to 17\"; I like to print at 300dpi - I have gotten 8x10 OK but I get the best clarity up to 5x7. I would think average users want 4x6 prints, and this camera delivers. If you plan to use this for specialized computer-edited works you will want a camera with more options like an Optical zoom and more MP. For the price and the features you get it's a great starter camera.","My wife wanted a digital camera after her 35mm broke down. She was looking for something easy to use and at a sensiable price. After doing some research, I chose the D-395 as a X-mas gift for 2004.<br /><br />Unlike Kodak that just got in the camera buisness because fewer consumers were using 35mm cameras, Olympus is a brand that has a lot of experinec with digital cameras. So the brand is well trusted. The pictures the D-395 takes are very good for a 3 Megapixel. When hooked up to a desktop, the camera works as an external memory drive. You can copy and paste pictures with a few clicks of the mouse. The software that comes with the camera is nothing compaired to Adobe Photoshop but will do for a beginer<br /><br />The controls are easy to use and once you set the camera up the way you like it, you can just point and shoot. The settings will not change even after you have pulled the batteries out and stored it for a few weeks.<br /><br />About the batteries, yes I do agree with the other reviewers, the D-395 will drain the required 2 AA batteries in a few hours but this is not any diffrent that any of the HP's and Kodac's my friends have. So add some recargables to your cart while you are here.<br /><br />Bottom line, the Olympus D-395 is a camera for beginers but in order to get the most of it, or any other digital camera. One must be a bit savy with technology or willing to take the time to learn. If you are looking for a cheap digital camera that will take great pictures with you not having to learn how to use it, then you best just stick with the 35mm.","There IS a spot metering mode and there IS a way to start the camera up without the monitor being on....to the person who wrote the last review...read the manual: I got this camera 20 minutes ago and already know that much! Anyways---I think this a great camera for the price...I have a Fuji also and like this the same but clarity is better on the screen. As with ALL digital cameras, the batteries go quickly so get rechargeable ones!! But one question-- does anyone have trouble with the playback mode of pictures-do they appear fuzzy for like 3 secs then appear clear?? Thanks.","This is the perfect digital camera for first time users like myself, takes good pictures and has a simple menu system. Ignore the bad reviews here, the pictures are fine and I suspect the photographers are to blame not the camera!","i purchased this camera for my mother who is a real estate agent. she uses it to shoot photos of the homes, and for nights out with her friends. not being a technological genius, she needed a simple camera. for her, this camera is perfect. as mentioned in some of the other reviews, its a touch slow, but she never finds it to be a problem.<br /><br />we didnt even know about the 2 in 1 and auto-stitching-panoramas that the camera/software bundle create - so that was a wonderful surprise when we discovered them.<br /><br />because of its slowness in focusing and actual capturing, i wouldnt recommend this camera to anyone who needs to do anything really quickly - but for some people, like my mother, this camera is exactly what she needed.","Was given a used D395 by a friend and have made good use of it since. Not evident problems, and picture quality seems quite adequate.","While the quality of photos I printed are good, even at 8x10, my problem is elsewhere.  Anytime the photo isn't in bright sunlight, the photo is garbage.  With the flash on the background all but disappears in blackness.  Without flash the image appears like a multiple exposure (fuzzy outlines).  Action shots are also problematic because of the delay from pressing the button and time until the photo is actually taken.  Outside of those problems the camera has held up well to my constant abuse and the short battery life is solved by turning off the auto-display of each picture after you take it & by using rechargeable batteries.","Easy to use, a great first time camera......if you are an experienced digital user, this may not be the one for you...go up to the 5 series.....batteries don't last in this bad boy, therefore consider nicad out the door....also, a larger storage bucket....gave this one to a friend who was non tech plus and she loves it.......","I just bought this camera. I compared a few and this was the best value I found. The pictures come out clear in all modes and the flash is acceptable. It is a bit slow, but so are all of these small cameras. I've used a Ricoh and a Nikon in the type and price range before and this is the best out of the three. The movie setting is unimportant to me, but the quality of the videos is very poor. If you want to take movies, buy a movie camera. This unit is very easy to use, simple on screen settings, easy fast download via the included USB cable. I do suggest getting rechargeable batteries, but I suggest that for all of these types of cameras. All in all, the camera is small and light, easy to carry, easy to use and takes great photos for the format of camera that it is. If you want to do fine photography you must buy top of the line equipment as none of these little cameras will take those kinds of pictures. There is more to it than just mega-pixels!","I just bought this camera;after buying, two negative reviews came out on amazon.This happened before I recieved the camera;worried I tried to cancel but the camera was in the shipping process.Boy am I glad I didn,t cancel;the camera works good for me.I bought it to take fish pictures;I also have a olympus 5050(top of the line camera 5mp)so I know what a good camera can do.I also know what to expect from a $130.oo camera.This camera is good for snapshot I don,t get  redeye with the flash;the movies look better than my Olympus 5050;the color is fantastic.The olympus d-395 is small light(fits in your pocket)shoots good right out of the box.I can't  stress this enough,if you like simplicity and want a simple camera that shoots good with no adjustments this camera is it.The display is 120000 pixels and looks as sharp and clear as my Olympus 5050;this makes it easy to check the sharpness of your pictures(you can zoom your picture in when displaying the picture on the lcd to check them)The camera is slow shot to shot but so are most cameras in this price range.The 395 also download you pictures without software with included USB cable.I prefer to back my exposier off -.5 when shooting in bright sunny outdoor conditions.I also turned down the LCD brightness 2 clicks.If you want simplicity,easy downloads,good picture on auto,fantastic LCD resolution,compactness and OLympus quality then buy this camera.","I got this digital camera about a week and a half ago, and I love it :) It takes great quality pictures, and good video, plus it's really easy to connect and download pictures to my PC. All I have to do is plug it in to the USB cable and it pops up a window giving me the downloading options.<br />The only problems I've had with it are that it eats up batteries pretty fast, and if you take pictures without the flash or from really far away in low light conditions, the pictures can be a little fuzzy. However, they still show up.<br />Overall, I'd reccomend this camera :) It's great, and I can take it anywhere."]},{"name":"Olympus C-60 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["Oh heavens.

I haven't had time to read the manual - but have been able to use it right out of the box because the automatic mode is easy to use.  Picture reviews are very convenient, too.  You don't have to turn off the camera - which is great.  I researched a lot of cameras before making a final decision and believe I got a great deal for the money spent - especially for a 6 megapixel camera.","I bought this camera last month and my husband loves it.  He loves the 2:1 feature, the 15 second movie bit, and the ease to look at pictures already taken without having to close the camera.  I bought an extra battery and larger XD card.  These items go a long way to a better experience.  All Olympus cameras have very similar menus to work with so it is easier to navigate through the menus if you are familiar with Olympus cameras.  This is an easy camera to operate.","This camera is very easy to use.  I took it to a bird show at an amusement park.  We were sitting way in the back and I took a picture of a bald eagle.  I didn't know if it would come out or not since it was so far away.  When I increased the size on the computer, it was still clear and I have a beautiful picture!  It's small, easy to carry holds lots of pictures.  I also took it on vacation and my traveling companion ended up getting one, too!","This is an excellent value for the price.

Bright pictures and the color is very good<br />3. Nice size. Can fit in a pocket, but you will notice it, but easy to carry around at parties and family functions.<br />4. Simple point and click if you want, or you can customize almost all aspects of a shot. It's the best of both worlds.<br />5. Great camera for the price. A ton of value at 300 bucks.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Load time when turning camera on with a large memory card is very slow. Plan on waiting 5 seconds for the camera to enter \"ready mode\" with a large memory card.<br />2. Could do better at taking wide angle shots. Canon is better in this area.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this camera for those looking for a great point and click camera.","I recently fell into a river and irretrievably destroyed my C-50 (not Olympus's fault, obviously).  Having been so happy with that one, I immediately replaced it with the C-60.  What follows is a comparison between the two, in the form of a user review I wrote for the C-50:<br /><br />[The C-50 is] a very powerful, versatile, and impressive little camera.  For taking shots in conditions of plentiful light, this camera was hard to beat, at least when it came out (it's since been discontinued).  When it hit the market, it was unquestionably the most powerful digital camera of its size.<br /><br />There are problems, however:<br /><br />1.  On the little movies, there is no \"sound\" available.<br />2.  You have to turn the camera off and close the cover to review the picture you just took!<br />3.  This camera cannot take pictures in low lighting conditions at all.  Not without the flash, at any rate.  Starting from about the late afternoon on, this camera is all but useless for natural-looking shots.  They'll be far too blurry; this is a constant annoyance.<br /><br />Olympus recently came out with the C-60 Zoom, which is the new version of this camera.  With that one, they have fixed problems 1 and 2 but not 3:  still a major problem, but this is not the only brand of digital camera with this problem.<br /><br />Also note:  if you're replacing a c-50 with the new c-60, you'll be able to use your batteries, your battery charger, and your memory disks with the new version.  You'll also be able to recycle the little cable that connects the camera to your USB port.<br /><br />Also, the C-60 can take memory cards of up to 512 MB!  This is pretty impressive (on the highest-quality setting, for example, this will allow you to take 118 pictures; on the lowest-quality setting, 6390!), although that's a pretty expensive little card.  With the C-50, coming out of the box the most it would take was a 256 MB card, unless you bodily sent the camera in to Olympus for a \"firmware upgrade,\" which was free if you provided proof that you had bought a 512 MB card.  This is not necessary with the C-60.<br /><br />Two pieces of advice:<br /><br />One, despite the vast memory attainable with the 512 MB card, I would suggest merely buying two 256's.  This is because, with this camera, the manner in which the card is inserted seems to increase the possibility of fatal scratches.  And if you have all your eggs in one basket -- thousands of pictures on a single card -- and you get that \"CARD ERROR\" message, you'll be up the creek, my friend.<br /><br />Second:  when you're buying it, you'll probably want to stock up on a few extra batteries.  The technology with the memory card and the image resolution is nothing short of astonishing, but it's surprising that the technology of these rechargeable batteries is not further along by this point.  The batteries only last a couple of hours before they need to be recharged!  If you're out shooting pictures all day, it's much more likely you'll need a new battery long before you'll need more memory.  Keep this in mind.","My previous digital camera was the C-50 and I shelled out the cash to upgrade to the C-60, and am greatly pleased.  The advantages of the C-60 over the C-50 are:<br /><br />-6 megapixel instead of 5 (not a huge deal if you're not printing anything bigger than 8x10s)<br /><br />-Movies have audio (C-50 video only)<br /><br />-Casing designed better (C-50 rubber flaps were always coming loose)<br /><br />-SuperMacro mode as close as 4cm (C-50 macro mode was horrible, only about 20-30cm focus minimum)<br /><br />-Mode dial more closely resembles other SLRs, with P/S/A/M options instead of having to navigate (C-50) through the digital menu to specify whether you want the shutter speed or aperature to be adjustable<br /><br />-Supports up to 512MB xD cards by default (C-50 supports only up to 128MB unless you ship it to Olympus for them to install a BIOS update)<br /><br />-Lens opens/closes more quickly (C-50 took 3-4 seconds)<br /><br />-Better LCD review screen<br /><br />-Supports higher capacity 12B Lithium battery instead of just 10B<br /><br />And it's still the nice small size that fits in my pocket when I travel.","Strengths: Very compact & light, quick startup (slower with bigger XD Media cards), lots of great features (like continuous shooting mode and red-eye reduction), long battery life.<br />Weaknesses: Weak flash, red-eye reduction not available in continuous shooting mode, slow startup with big XD Media cards.<br />Summary: This is overall a great camera (see list of main strengths above). My biggest complaint is that the flash is pretty weak, and cannot be brightened in \"auto\" mode. However, if you switch the camera to one of the manual modes, you have more control over the brightness of the flash -- but I've found that increasing the brightness washes out the subjects too much. So you're stuck between a rock & a hard place. The perfect flash I ever used was on a Nikon Coolpix 995 camera, but that camera is big & bulky & slow compared to this camera. So if you're going to be doing a lot of daylight shooting or outdoor shooting that doesn't require heavy use of a flash, this camera is for you. If you're doing a lot of nighttime or indoor shooting (like me), you'll be hard-pressed to get rid of this spritely little camera that's chock-full of features, and instead you'll find yourself turning on lots of overhead lights to flood more light into the room.","I have this camera for 2 months.<br />Good quality photos. Easy to use.<br />No digital zoom in auto mode.<br />I can't buy extra battery LI-12B","Simply love it, I purchased this camera about a month ago this is my 2nd olympus the 1st lasting for 5 years (and still going strong) but just a 1.3 megapixel only good for 4 x 6 prints  My wife & I wanted a camera capable of larger prints.  We have had 8 x 10s printed from the camera and they are excellent.  We were told you could get a 20 x 30 print if we wanted. Some may have trouble with the controls but this is not just a \"point and shoot camera\" it has all of the bells & whistles that photo buffs demand, but also an Auto mode and the camera will do all the work.","I have been getting excellent results with this little beauty. I don't understand the comment on battery life, since I am getting 200-250 pictures on a charge. My only complaint is the size of the XD card that they supply with the unit. For a 6 Megapixel camera, you would think they would give you more storage to start with than 32MB. other than that the quality is excellent, pictures are high resolution and the Camedia software supplied with the camera does an excellent job.","great product. only sore point was its size. not as compact as i would have liked.","Unbelievably small and lightweight for a 6mp camera. Still haven't mastered all the controls, but only because I haven't wanted to spend the time with the manual. Overall, great quality and fine prints. My only complaint is the button for telephoto/wide angle is so tiny it's actually hard to use."]},{"name":"Pentax Optio 43WR","amazon_reviews":["But the viewing screen is so small it's hard to see and easily scratched.  Using the different modes and options isn't very user friendly and once your batteries die, you have to re-set the date stamp when replacing them.  We've not dropped it in water, so can't speak to it's resistance, but seems very solid and size is convenient for travel.","Though it's been many moons since I bought this camera (let alone since it was cutting-edge), I still feel this camera is a far better choice for adventure photography than other, newer cameras.<br /><br />Here's my take on this:<br /><br />1. It takes AA's. That's worth the price of admission, right there. You can be in the middle of the jungle in Ecuador, but you'll find someone or some place with AA's (or you can bring some Nicads and a solar charger!). Not being tied to an outlet is key.<br /><br />2. There are no lens elements outside of the housing, and there's nothing to move/slide/click-into-place while taking pictures. The more stuff that moves or wiggles, the higher the chances of water getting in. The KISS principle in full effect: \"Keep It Simple, Stupid\".<br /><br />3. It uses SD cards. There's no little pins involved like with CF cards/readers, and the cards' ratio of storage to physical size are great. I don't think the software in the camera can handle newer, \"roomier\" cards, but my one-gig card can take 395 pics at max quality. I called Pentax to ask what the largest card size could be, but I don't remember what they said. It might be 2 or 4.<br /><br />4. The video and audio quality is surprisingly good. I did NOT expect that. Great for fishing/hiking trips, etc. You can get some graininess in shots (outdoors OR indoors)... I set the ISO to 200 to be safe.<br /><br />5. The most obvious negative is the image quality. At the time of writing this, there are pocket-cameras with 10MP sensors... AND they're optically stabilized. If you're not going to blow up images to silly sizes, this will do fine to capture once-in-a-lifetime experiences in wet or harsh places.<br /><br />6. Size. While it's no SLR, it's also not a tiny PowerShot. Oh, well.<br /><br />I hope this camera lasts for a long time, as I'll be very sad when it dies.","You still can't have it all.  I have taken 100's of pictures with this unit in just about every environment imaginable.  You do sacrifice something in image quality with this camera.  The flip side of that coin is that I have taken pictures places where other digital cameras would have been destroyed.  I have gotten some amazing and beautiful pics with this camera, it just does not take GREAT A+ quality pictures as consistently as other cameras I own.  If you're looking for a unit to take on your outdoor adventures where you are concerned about killing your camera during that swim or adventure in the sand and dust this is a great camera to own.","As someone into boating and sailing, I have always only bought waterproof or water resistant cameras -- starting with the Canon Aqua Snappy 35mm and Minolta Weathermatic APS film cameras.  My first digital waterproof camera, was the only one available at the time -- Sony Cybershot U60 (no longer made).  Nice little 2mp camera and I liked the memory stick compatibility with Sony Vaio laptops, but the lack of zoom was a real limitation and the requirement to use rechargeable batteries was inconvenient for longer trips (if you don't need zoom you might be able to get a good deal on a used U60).<br /><br />To get zoom and a significant bump up in mp, I bought the Optio 43WR about 5 months ago and, although only water resistant (not for diving!) it has proven to be a really versatile on-the-water camera...<br /><br />(1) for shots from a boat, optical viewfinder is critical for bright sunlight (LCD washes out), plus for bracing camera against your face,<br /><br />(2) movie clips are for real with the Optio, so no need for bulky waterproof camcorder/housing (get a big SD card though),<br /><br />(3) easy, obvious rear panel controls with minimum menu-based manipulation enable you to get the fast shot while out on deck,<br /><br />(4) AA battery power is also critical, for extended cruises (since no AC power available for chargers),<br /><br />(5) subtle but really practical point, unlike some super-thin cameras, the square box shape of the Optio WR43 enables you to hold it easily and almost completely within your palm and therefore protect the lens from spray while moving around the boat,<br /><br />(6) and with the optional neoprene case (search Amazon for product PTX-L70), a pretty rugged total package.<br /><br />Waterproof/water resistance camera options are getting more numerous... you might want to check out the Ricoh Caplio 300G/400G if you want a waterproof, large-body camera, though I believe these Ricohs are only available from Japan.<br /><br />I'm also considering a move to the new Pentax Optio WP, a 5mp, waterproof (JIS8 standard - 5ft depth) camera, or the new Sony DSC-T7 with optional waterproof housing (9.8 ft depth)... note however that both of these are LCD viewfinder-only units, so the key will be LCD performance in bright sunlight.","Excellent camera in every respect but one.  Shutter speed for night pics is very slow and pics are easily blurred by the slightest movement over the seemingly interminable amount of time before the pic is complete. i would still recommend it, just either use a tripod for night pics or have hands like stones.  its really nice to have a digital camera that can get immersed in h2o, since so many of my vacations involve water.  pentax cameras in general take exceptional pics, far better than my sony digital camera.","I bought this camera so I could take pictures while standing in the rain - literally! I don't know if I will actually do that, but it 'is' supposed to be waterproof (or at least water-resistant) and can supposably remain fully submerged in shallow water for a little while. I also needed for it to be able to take excellent quality photographs and based on examples I saw posted on the web I decided that this camera was good enough in that regard. The first day I had this camera I took about 60 or 70 pics with it on a beautiful sunny day using a Viking brand 512MB SD card that I purchased with it. I have to say that the pictures were excellent including some really amazing \"macros\" that I took of some bright yellow flowers. Also, I think that the camera is kind of \"cute-looking\". It is smaller than what I had expected it to be. I thought that it might be something like 5 or 6 inches square, but it is only 3 by 3 inches and about an inch or so thick. I like the fact that it is that small. That is about all I know to tell you about this camera. I think chances are very good anyone considering buying this camera would not regret it.","The first reviewer gave a very low rate to this great camera, not fair. So I feel I should jump in.<br /><br />When I decided to upgrade my old Canon S100, I was very clear on four things:<br /><br />1) It must use AA batteries.  Firm, very firm on this.  As long as you must carry a charger, you end up never take the camera with you. As simple as that.<br /><br />2) It must have macro mode to take good close up pictures. Without this, for example, your gadgets look horrible when you sell them on eBay.<br /><br />3) It must do good enough video recording for occasional and short motion pictures. I always hate to take a camcorder with me, but I do find sometimes I miss it.<br /><br />4) It must use SD or CF cards, not XD cards.  SD/CF are popular and cheap and they have large capacity.  Easy to insert them into my laptop, PDA or image bank to transfer images and/or view them.<br /><br />So, that narrows down my searching to three models: Nikon Coolpix 3200, Kodak CX7430 and Pentax optio43WR.<br /><br />The video taken from 3200 sucks, especially indoor video is garbage ¨C way too noisy.  It¡¯s ruled out first.  BTW, if you are going to take some video of your children indoor, don¡¯t get this 3200.  The CX7430 takes fantastic indoor video, but I never be able to get a focused close up picture.  Sadly put it out of this game.<br /><br />The Pentax fulfilles all my needs and is clearly the keeper.  It uses just 2 AA batteries and it is very compact.  If I want longer battery life, I can use widely available CR-V3 batteries as well.  Perfect.  Its super macro mode is even better than the 3200 (1cm vs. 2cm).  I could take a picture that just covers a dime with sharp focus, or a picture of my SMD circuit boards showing clearly the tiny components and their printed values.  This is a surprise, because Coolpix series is well known for their super macro capability and Pentax only claims 10cm macro in its specs (a typo?).<br /><br />It takes fantastic video outdoor and indoor.  Even at very low light conditions, the video still look good (like CX7430, with some noise, but not annoying at all).  Video recorded at 640x480@15 is smooth enough and, at 30, it is totally free of jerkiness.  However, I did find that recording is not reliable at 30fps, it pauses every 10 seconds or so, but it might be due to my slow SD card (a SanDisk 256MB, not an ultra one).  Anyway, 15 fps is good enough to me and I¡¯ll never need to carry a camcorder again, that¡¯s for sure.<br /><br />43WR has many more features, but I cannot list them all. Unique water resistant, of course.  Its lenses do not extend out like most cameras, very nice.  It starts up very quickly (less than 2 seconds) and lags between shots are very short (about 2-3 seconds with flash).  I have no idea why some reviewers such as Steves-digicams say it¡¯s slow.  Actually, it even has a quick-start feature: when this feature is enabled (not by default), you don¡¯t need to press the power button first; you simply press the shot button and the camera will turn on and take a picture right way within about just one second, very handy.  Its buttons and menus are very well designed.  The LCD screen is very good, even under the sunlight. You can see thumbernails and zoom pictures.  It displays multiple languages including Chinese. There are no doors at the bottom side; so you don¡¯t need to take the camera off a tripod to change batteries and SD cards.  Overall, a very thoughtful product, which is harder and harder to see on market.  Oh, for those who cares, the camera is made in Japan (other accessories may not).<br /><br />The bottom line is: if you don¡¯t care about the video side, the Nikon 3200 is fine.  If you don¡¯t take dime pictures, the Kodak CX7430 is decent.  If you want all, the 43WR is the one, the only one right now.","But the viewing screen is so small it's hard to see and easily scratched.

Everyone on my work said : amazing, small and really looks great! Awesome pictures, strong and durable material, extra long battery life, quality is the best and really LOVE THIS ITEM FOREVER!!","We used this camera for about a month and we were very happy with it.  That is until my husband carried the camera in his pocket on the way to the car and cracked the LCD screen making it unveiwable.  We have always carried cameras this way and never had a problem.  The warranty specifically states that the LCD is not covered.  When I called Casio they said to go ahead and send it in and the technician would decide if it is covered.  We prepared for the worst - a long process with a cost to repair equal to the price of a new camera.  However, we couldn't believe that exactly one week after we mailed it to Casio it showed up at our door completely repaired - free of charge.  We haven't even received proof of delivery from the post office.  Excellent customer service by any standard.","Esta camara es buenisima para el precio que tiene. Ya yo llevo un año con ella y no me ha dado ningun problema. Tiene un zoom extremadamente bueno y es ideal para viajar. A pesar de que se me ha caido muchisimas veces todavia sirve super bien. Se las recomiendo a todos!!!!!!!!","Well I got this camera about 6 months ago and nothing has gone wrong. Some of the best features are:<br /><br />1. Large LCD screen<br /><br />2. Metal covering, more durable.<br /><br />3. Many picture modes<br /><br />4. Easy to use<br /><br />5. Takes Quick pictures<br /><br />6. SMALL ! Yes i know there are much smaller but for $220 its pretty good<br /><br />Good for a 1st time camera","After borrowing my brother's digital camera for a trip this summer, I finally caved and decided to invest in my own. After a bunch of online research I settled on this, and I'm pretty happy with it. The only reason I can't enthuse unrestrainedly is because I haven't had the chance to figure out how everything on it works yet - and it has a LOT of features!<br /><br />One of the best selling points for me was the size. This thing is TINY! Everyone remarks on it, and I love the fact that I can stick it in a small purse with room to spare when I'm at parties. And despite the overall size, it has a screen that's large enough to appreciate the composition of the photos you take, both before and after.<br /><br />Another selling point was that it has a Pentax lens, and while I don't know much about cameras, that was a highly-recommended feature on some of the professional photography sites I consulted. Also, the body is mostly metal rather than plastic, making it hardier than some of the cheaper models on the market.<br /><br />It has enough manual features on it that I can play around for different light effects, etc. But when I want a simple snapshot, it has not only a basic snapshot setting, but a couple dozen \"best shot\" features that automatically set the various light sensitivities and shutter speeds, etc.<br /><br />I haven't really had the chance to test it in good outdoors light, since it's winter now and everything's kind of grey, but overall I've been pleased with the photos both in digital form and the few that I've had printed. Some of them have been a bit fuzzy, but I'm convinced that's from my own experimentation with manual settings.<br /><br />Two other important features made this a smart investment for me: long battery life and speed. I have yet to find myself in a situation where I have run out of batteries in the middle of the day (as I did with my brother's camera a couple of times this summer). The startup speed is impressive - you can start to shoot almost immediately after you press the power button - and the recovery speed between shots is negligible. This is a feature that makes it an invaluable snapshot camera.<br /><br />The only drawback I can think of at the moment is that 3MP is probably a bit low for the price I paid for the camera. But since I'm not likely to be making many prints that are any larger than the standard 3 x 5, I'm not too worried about that. The money, as far as I'm concerned, went into the construction and features I was looking for.<br /><br />I think this is a great starter camera for someone who wants something light, portable, durable, generally easy to use but with lots of additional features to play around with to make things interesting. If I were more into photography, I'd obviously want something with more resolution, or an SLR. But as it is, I'm very pleased with my new toy!","I felt in love with this camera. My first one! Everyone on my work said : amazing, small and really looks great! Awesome pictures, strong and durable material, extra long battery life, quality is the best and really LOVE THIS ITEM FOREVER!!","We used this camera for about a month and we were very happy with it.  That is until my husband carried the camera in his pocket on the way to the car and cracked the LCD screen making it unveiwable.  We have always carried cameras this way and never had a problem.  The warranty specifically states that the LCD is not covered.  When I called Casio they said to go ahead and send it in and the technician would decide if it is covered.  We prepared for the worst - a long process with a cost to repair equal to the price of a new camera.  However, we couldn't believe that exactly one week after we mailed it to Casio it showed up at our door completely repaired - free of charge.  We haven't even received proof of delivery from the post office.  Excellent customer service by any standard.","Esta camara es buenisima para el precio que tiene. Ya yo llevo un año con ella y no me ha dado ningun problema. Tiene un zoom extremadamente bueno y es ideal para viajar. A pesar de que se me ha caido muchisimas veces todavia sirve super bien. Se las recomiendo a todos!!!!!!!!","Well I got this camera about 6 months ago and nothing has gone wrong. Some of the best features are:<br /><br />1. Large LCD screen<br /><br />2. Metal covering, more durable.<br /><br />3. Many picture modes<br /><br />4. Easy to use<br /><br />5. Takes Quick pictures<br /><br />6. SMALL ! Yes i know there are much smaller but for $220 its pretty good<br /><br />Good for a 1st time camera","After borrowing my brother's digital camera for a trip this summer, I finally caved and decided to invest in my own. After a bunch of online research I settled on this, and I'm pretty happy with it. The only reason I can't enthuse unrestrainedly is because I haven't had the chance to figure out how everything on it works yet - and it has a LOT of features!<br /><br />One of the best selling points for me was the size. This thing is TINY! Everyone remarks on it, and I love the fact that I can stick it in a small purse with room to spare when I'm at parties. And despite the overall size, it has a screen that's large enough to appreciate the composition of the photos you take, both before and after.<br /><br />Another selling point was that it has a Pentax lens, and while I don't know much about cameras, that was a highly-recommended feature on some of the professional photography sites I consulted. Also, the body is mostly metal rather than plastic, making it hardier than some of the cheaper models on the market.<br /><br />It has enough manual features on it that I can play around for different light effects, etc. But when I want a simple snapshot, it has not only a basic snapshot setting, but a couple dozen \"best shot\" features that automatically set the various light sensitivities and shutter speeds, etc.<br /><br />I haven't really had the chance to test it in good outdoors light, since it's winter now and everything's kind of grey, but overall I've been pleased with the photos both in digital form and the few that I've had printed.

I love this part!!<br /><br />3.Easy to use: Camera has many predefined settings very useful for newbies or is you are in a hurry and don't have the time to manipulate ISO settings and so forth.<br /><br />4.Battery: This is one of the strongest points of this digicam. Once you fully charge this baby you can forget that task for a week. The battery just goes and goes and goes.<br /><br />5.Video: the video mode have a great resolution, it's fast and is unlimited. You can record your videos until your SD card runs out of megs.<br /><br />6.Picture browsing: you can browse your pictures through a built-in calendar. This is very useful when you have a big SD card and don't want to search pic by pic.<br /><br />7.Favorites: the camera has a built-in favourite's folder where you can store your favourite's pics and that way share with your friends.<br /><br />8.Speaker: this is almost standard in the nowadays digicams but is always nice to know that you can count in a built-in speaker.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1.Not great image quality: definitely this camera doesn't offer the best quality you can get in others. The pictures have a noticeable amount of noise most of the times and the colors are not bright enough. However if you are not printing big pictures then this is not a big of a deal.<br /><br />2.Poor LCD: now this is a shame. Yes, the LCD is huge however the image quality on it is awful. Is noisy most of the time and very sensitive to light variations.<br /><br />3.No standard battery support: this card us a proprietary battery so you won't be able to use your AA on this baby. I recommend getting a backup battery pack. The good news is that the battery life is UNBEATABLE.<br /><br />4.PC connection: the camera comes with a sync cradle/battery charger that you have to connect to your PC in order to download the pics. It can be annoying to carry that cradle all the time.<br /><br />Bottom line: Casio Exilim Z40 is a bang for your buck. It's very small, nice looking and easy to use also the battery life is unbelievable. However the picture quality is not great. So if you are a PRO don't mind getting this one but if you are a casual snapshooter who can trade a not-so-great image quality for economy, ease of use and small size this is a very good option for you.","I purchased this camera for my daughter for Christmas.  I was drawn by the size, easy enough for a 16 year old to slip in her pocket, the battery life and the included docking station. She loved it, taking hundreds of pictures at a time, yes the battery last a long time. Although display screen is bigger than that of my Kodak, it is grainy and poor quality, however, again she loved the camera. One major dilemma!!! Dont drop this baby. She was taking a picture and was bumped, only to have the lens mechanism stop working and basically leave the camera unusable.  I sent the camera in to the service, in N.J. the ONLY service area available apparently, and also found the most of the service people caustic. After waiting through the queue for almost 10 minutes, when I didnt have a repair #, I was promptly disconnected. I do however, appreciate the assistance of Becky, who not only assisted me with a reduction in the cost of repair, but has helped me on several occasions in my attempt to get the camera fixed. But nonetheless, the repair is not covered under warranty and cost about $200, just a bit less than I paid. So here is the dilemma, nice little camera, just make sure not to drop it and be prepared for a bit of work with the service.","I got this camera off Ebay. Slight hesitant after reading some of the negative comments. Had it for a week now and I can say no regret for getting this gem. Here is my take:<br /><br />1) Camera is well built and solid. Not too small but very light for carrying it around. I had other cameras that at the end of a outing would feel like brick! I would recommend holding it with both hands to shoot otherwise picture do blur with movement.<br /><br />2) Menu system is very well designed. Also moving around the menu is speedy.<br /><br />3) Lots of features like movie taking mode with sound, voice recording, adding sound tags on pictures, 23 scene modes...<br /><br />4) Battery life. Though I haven't test this yet. It is very important to me. I have run out of battery with other camera before and didn't want it to happen again! I understand the battery will allow 360 shots per charge.<br /><br />5) Dock is small so is the AC charger. I like the option on it to easily transfer images to my computer by pushing a single button. There is also a picture button to do slideshow while camera is on dock.<br /><br />So all in all I am very happy with the purchase. The only negative I would have is \"yes\" picture quality can be improve - especially in low light. But my need is primary to have a snapshot camera easy to carry and available at all time so this fits the bill.","I bought this camera from Amazon about 2 months ago and have not stopped taking pictures since!  The best thing about this camera is it's small size and large viewing screen.  It has a variety of functions that allow you to take just about any kind of picture you could want.  If you're looking for a good, all around easy to use camera that offers quality and versatility I would recommend this camera.  Also a great value.  For anyone who wants more professional pictures or longer video recording time this camera probably isn't for you.","Pros:<br /><br />-Very Small<br /><br />-Large Screen<br /><br />-Nice Button Layout<br /><br />-Durable<br /><br />-Nice Movie Quality<br /><br />-Tons of modes and features<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-Screen Smudges Easy<br /><br />-Picture Quality is not 4 MP's<br /><br />-Battery Drains Fast<br /><br />The Casio is a very nice camera and as a whole, I really enjoy it. However, the picture quality is really not as good as it could be and the pictures do not feel like 4 Mega Pixels for all the shots. If you are looking for a small camera with a decent photo this one may be a good call, however, the 5 MP version is not that much more money and may be a more bang for your buck!","Positives:<br /><br />- good photos in good light conditions<br /><br />- quite small<br /><br />- nice, large display<br /><br />- quick start time<br /><br />- superb battery<br /><br />- lots of predefined settings, easy to use<br /><br />- uses cheap SD cards<br /><br />- build-in 9 MB of memory = 8 extra photos when you are out of space<br /><br />- good quality movies with sound - with 1 GB SD card ($50) you can forget about a separate video cam.<br /><br />- availability of underwater kit (expensive like hell!)<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />- quite fragile (broke one, fortunately had a replacement warranty and got another one for free)<br /><br />- photos in low light conditions are unacceptable - lots of noise<br /><br />- metal enclosure is very thin and delicate (Almond Joy's almond can easily dent it and damage the camera)<br /><br />- quite expensive - for the same price you can get a better camera from a better producer<br /><br />- buttons too small to use when in ski gloves<br /><br />Overall opinion - unless you get a great deal on this camera, better check offers from Nikon, Sony and Canon.","I bought this camera as a replacement for my Olympus Camedia 3040. I found I never wanted to lug that thing around and so I started looking for a compact camera with a quick shutter lag. This camera lives up that with a terrific LCD and incredible battery life.<br /><br />The downside with this camera is the speed of the flash recharge. That can be a drag from time to time but it's something I'm willing to live with given this lil' numbers' other terrific qualities.","I researched for months to find the best camera.  I love my Casio<br /><br /><br /><br />1. The battery lasts forever <br /><br />2. The large LCD screen is a great plus. Very clear <br /><br />3. It can fit in my pocket<br /><br />4. Easy to us. that was important for me!!<br /><br />5. Comes with charging dock. <br /><br />6. Great Price.<br /><br />Plus lots of other great features. <br /><br /><br /><br />Now all my friends and family own one. <br />","I bought this camera a few months ago.  I have had no trouble with it at all, and have been pleasantly surprised by a few key details:<br /><br />1.  Casio has AMAZING customer service.  I had a question about the memory and how to maximize it; called their 1-800 number (found on their website) and a person immediately answered.  He addressed my problem and solved it in two minutes.  I suppose we should expect customer service like that, but it's rare, so I applaud it!<br /><br />2.  The camera has a number of pre-chosen settings for different situations:  \"Candlelight,\" \"Portrait,\" etc.  These work beautifully.<br /><br />3.  It does take a few minutes to learn the different buttons (realistic estimate: 15 minutes, total, over a few uses), but they make perfect sense and, as there are so many options, I can't imagine being able to include all of them in a way that would be easier to use.  The choices make sense and are organized in a way that makes them easy to remember.<br /><br />4.  The camera is TINY.  TEENY.  It fits in all my pockets - and I wear tight jeans.  And there is a beautiful case available for it on E-Bay -- just search for EX-Z40 case.  It's $16, from Australia, and is awesome.<br /><br />5.  The screen is huge and easy to see.","There were definitely a number of things I liked about the camera - size, docking station, ease of use (even without thick user's guide).  But the quality of the pictures (couldn't figure out how to get sharp, focused pictures) plus the long lag time when taking a picture had me return the camera to the dealership.  Too bad.","Pros:  compact, great battery life, quick start-up, quick release, ease of use, solid built.<br /><br />Cons:  With outdoor lighting pictures are fine but a bit noisy (electronic clouded picture), therefore not crisp, solids look cloudy.  This noise is much more pronounced in indoor or low light pictures even when using the flash; enough to make me wish I hadn't bought this.  My old 2meg Canon A20 and Nikon 2100 takes better, crisper pictures. This shows up in the LCD display and also on the computer monitor and printed pictures.  I wanted a compact camera with a quick shutter release.  This camera meets this but I am quite disappointed with the picture quality.  The 4 megapixel doesn't help.  This is my 3rd digital camera.","After reading many reviews and playing with many Canon Digi's of friends and relatives, Canon is much better in design and overall photo capturing quality compared to Casio.  My Casio destroys many shots that others capture with no problem.  Many are blurry, with poor color and digital noise.","I just purchased the Exilim Z40 for Christmas and couldn't be happier. I used to have an Olympus digital camera which worked perfect but it was big and bulky and hated having to carry it around in a bag and look like a tourist. For this reason I never had it with me and was always missing great shots.<br /><br />Now with the Exilim Z40 I can put the camera in my jean's back pocket and go everywhere and take it anywhere and never miss a shot. The picture quality is great although not so good when using the digital zoom. It feels great in your hand and the onscreen menus are easy to understand and use.","I picked up this little camera from Amazon a couple of weeks ago. Read all the documentation (even the extensive PDF manual available online) and played with all the features the camera had to offer.<br /><br />I bought it to replace my ancient (8 years old now) .8 Megapixel Olympus D-300L. A venerable camera but no longer up to the caliber demanded of today's high resolution monitors.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />I was surprised and impressed with the quality of the AVI clips that this camera took, lighting was good and the images were smooth. Sound was OK but, given the tiny microphone and the fact that this is just an \"extra\" for a digital camera, quite passable.<br /><br />Also, the dock and ease of transferring images were great too.<br /><br />Its size was great, fit in a breast pocket with no trouble at all and it was relatively quick to power up.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />In spite of its video abilities, I found the camera's images lacking, especially in lower light conditions (read anytime you are indoors). With or without flash, the images were not substantially superior than those taken with my older Olympus. I was very surprised to find, in situations where I had taken still shots and then video clips, that the videos were very nice and the stills were terrible.<br /><br />As for colors, blacks were not very pristine, taking on a rather mottled appearance of browns and grays. There were interesting artifacts that appeared when light was reflecting off of a modestly shiny surface (say a black leather jacket or someone's forehead under a light) that took on almost a sparkling aspect.<br /><br />Recycle time for the flash was frustratingly long too, 'though from other reviews I have read I suspect this may be common to all of these more compact cameras.<br /><br />Indoor pictures taken with a tripod and really long exposures seem to fare better, and outdoor shots were not as bad as indoor. But I didn't get such a small camera in order to lug around steadying apparatus in order to take pictures at parties :(<br /><br />In the end, I returned the camera. I'm still in search of a very small camera that takes adequate pictures. I recognize that I won't be able to get the quality of an SLR in such a small package, but my expectations were greater than this little camera was able to satisfy. I'm now looking at Konica Minolta's Dimage X50 (or Xg or Xt) as an alternative.","do not love my casio camera<br />i would not go with casio if were you","+ Long baterry life<br />+ small size<br />+ big lcd<br /><br />- Problems with colors (white balance) in auto setting<br />- if you taking pix with AUTO , don't expect good, sharp or natural photo<br />- to many functions/ really complicated","I bough this camera about a month ago, and so far love it! I started carrying it around in my laptop bag when I go to work. You never know when you'll need it! My girlfriend is begining to make fun of me always having this camera around!<br /><br />Anyway, I took it on a recent trip, and managed to shoot 512MB card full of pictures. As other posts suggest, the battery did not even go from showing full charge. On the plane home, reviewing the pictures, I finally saw the battery meter drop one bar.<br /><br />Finally, here is a tip to make the camera a bit more responsive. Make sure that Album auto create is set to off. You can access it via this menu:<br /><br />Menu > Play > Create Album > Set Up > Auto > Off.<br /><br />If it is set to \"On\", the photo album is re-created after each shot, and as the number of pictures goes up, the time it takes to build an album increases. There is a noticeable delay before you can take another picture. I relized this at about 100 shots.<br /><br />Good luck, you'll love this camera.","I love my Casio.  This is the second digital camera that I have owned, my first being a Sony Mavica.  The size on this camera makes it so convenient to bring anywhere.  It is very easy to use, especially with the accompanying camera dock to upload your pictures to the computer.  Battery lasts forever.  I can't find a bad thing to say about the Casio Exilim.","I did about a month of research before I finally purchased this camera and I must say that I made the right choice. Here are the reasons why I purchased it and why I am very pleased with my purchase (not in any particular order).<br /><br />1. Doesn't have the lens problem (E18) that Canons do<br /><br />2. Has high quality pictures with hardly any wait time to focus and inbetween shots<br /><br />3. Best Shot mode is very convenient<br /><br />4. Many more manual controls than most ultra-compact cameras<br /><br />5. Extremely small and light weight<br /><br />6. Battery life excedes any competitors'<br /><br />7. 2\" Display<br /><br />8. Comes with a docking station for very easy transfer of pictures to either PC or Mac<br /><br />9. The price<br /><br />I hope that this helps anyone who is considering an ultra-compact camera, it takes great pictures and is extremely convenient. Why spend more for the Canon S410 and get less?","I was in the market for an ultra-compact camera, and I knew exactly what I would use it for: real life social events (I am in my early 20's). These include weekend outings with friends (whether it be camping or playing in the park or BBQ's), dinner gatherings, family pictures, clubbing, sports events, etc.<br /><br />So, these were my main criterias when choosing a camera:<br /><br />1) Size - I basically wanted something tiny. But I wanted a real, useable camera...not those \"keychain digital cameras\".<br /><br />2) Picture quality - I wanted quality lenses, a 4+ megapixel resolution, and I wanted to have seen good sample pictures online from various websites.<br /><br />3) Unlimited movie lengths - My last camera (Dimage F100 which was great by the way, but unfortunately I spilled a drink on it) only took 30 second clips. Sometimes, moments worth recording last longer than 30 seconds.<br /><br />4) Speed - I wanted something that started up quickly, and I wanted something that didn't lag between pictures.<br /><br />5) Feature Set - I wanted a camera with a strong feature set offering, including sophisticated auto focus, different picture modes, and the ability to manipulate pictures from the camera's menu should I need to do so while I am away from my computer.<br /><br />6) SD card memory - No compact flash for me.<br /><br />7) Battery life - I want it to last through a long-weekend roadtrip. No, I don't want to bring the cradle along while I'm roadtripping or chilling on a boardwalk.<br /><br />8) Looks - After all, I will be pulling this out of my pocket at clubs, right?<br /><br />Given these criterias, I narrowed my choices down to the Pentax Optio S4i, Casio Exilim ex-z40, Sony T1, and the Canon SD110.<br /><br />After days of research, I chose the Casio. After owning it for 2 weeks now and having taken it out on the town multiple times, here are my observations:<br /><br />1. Picture quality - To make it easy: it's great. Ultra-compact cameras have come a long way in terms of sophistication and quality. I use 2304 x 1728 fine resolution on a Kingston 512mb SD card, and by the time it reaches my 17 inch lcd monitor and/or a 4x6 professionally developed printout, it's simply a high quality picture. Indoor pictures aren't glamour-photo-studio crystal-clear sometimes, especially with florescent lighting, but this camera will exceed the needs and expectations of most day-to-day uses like mine. I don't want or need to do professional portraits to frame, and if I do, I would not be using this tiny pocket camera. For sure, this Casio beats the old 35mm cameras in picture quality, plus the feature set and ease of use easily puts using a 35mm camera out of the question. In fact, most of my indoor pictures from last night were really, really good. Simply put, it is above par with what you'd expect from a high quality, name brand 4 megapixel ultra compact camera these days. And probably most of the time, you'd just be surprised at how well pictures come out.<br /><br />2. Build quality - Great. Yes, I have a Made in China version. I was wary of this and at first was praying that somehow mine would arrive in the mail with a Made in Japan sticker. But, after accidentally dropping it twice from waist level (as we will all do in day-to-day social situations), the camera is just fine. Feels solid. The little knob at the side that holds the included lanyard spins around and makes tiny squeaky noises...understandable and usually unnoticeable, but it annoys me at times.<br /><br />3. Ease of use - top notch. As expected from a company like Casio, the menu takes no brains to figure out. In my experience of designing user interfaces for general public use, I frankly think you can't make a menu that's more dumbed-down than this. The button placements are just about perfect. On/off button requires the fingertip to press, since it's tiny and hidden within grooves. But I think of this as a spectacular design feature, because I do not want my camera turning on in my pocket. Menu and Disp buttons are tiny, but come on, that's what we're looking for, right?<br /><br />4. Speed - Generally good. Start up time is more than quick enough. At a party, when a photo opportunity comes up, I'd grab the camera and push on and I can capture a moment pretty much faster than anyone else with a digital camera. With flash, occasionally you'd have to pause 1-2 seconds inbetween shots. But realistically, everyone in social situations know and understand the capabilities of ultra-compact digital cameras.<br /><br />5. Battery life - fantastic! One major reason I chose this Casio was the stated long battery time. It hasn't let me down yet. On multiple occasions of all-day normal use (including many many many on/offs, using the huge 2.0 inch LCD screen on the back for all pictures, and using flash for virtually all my nighttime pictures), the battery indicator didn't even drop from full-charge. I still charge every night, though, when I upload my pics. I'm waiting to bring it on a long-weekend trip to see how it holds up. But I'm confident I couldn't have made a better choice as far as battery. I'm pretty darn sure neither the Canon, Pentax, nor Sony could match this Casio in terms of battery.<br /><br />The negatives: not too many.<br /><br />1. When indoors, the LCD screen is extremely grainy. This is weird, because outdoors it's great and clear and impressive. But when you're at home in front of a computer and you turn on the camera and point it around a lighted room, it looks like you're watching an old tv with really bad antenna reception. But, I mean, it works just fine for you to take pictures with.<br /><br />2. Travel charger. I wish they'd give me a travel charger for road trips, because I don't always need/want to dock my camera.<br /><br />3. Picture quality. Aren't we always hoping for a camera that will one day produce perfect pictures automatically 100% of the time?<br /><br />4. No AV/OUT nor AC/DC charger capability. Not that I really would use either of these, but it's something that other cameras seem to have that mine doesn't.<br /><br />That's about it. Hope this review helps.","I'm using this camera for the past 5 months now and it is great and the battery life if really long. to enjoy it even better buy it with \"Sandisk 512 MB Secure Digital Ultra II (SDSDH-512-901)\" this will make the saving much faster and you will never be out of memory. and another good thing about this camera is how easy to load the pictures and the video clips to the PC. till date i didn't see better camera with it size and price.","OK, here's the deal; I have had a Cannon Camera in the past and really liked it.  I saw all the great comments that Cannon always had and all the bad comments for the older model of the Casio digital Cameras.  It took me a long time but I finally pulled the trigger and purchased this camera.  It was love at first sight, then it became a love-hate relationship, followed by love again.  Why the rollercoaster of Digital emotions?  Well I will tell you.  You will love the size, the quick action, the programs are better than average that is bundled with this camera, and the wonderful battery life.  I have yet to see anything less than full on the battery.  That is the love.  To avoid the love-hate thing take my advice, bit the bullet and download the full PDF file that is the Manual that they are too cheap to include.  Read is all and then take more pictures.  Your experience will be much much much better.  Little hint:  there are two types of auto-focus and you will do well to fully understand both.<br /><br />After about 3 months and over 300 pictures I love it.  I'm sure there are better quality cameras on the market but this is for snapshots.  It's is so small we take it everywhere and that alone makes this little guy worth it.<br /><br />Last note, go ahead and buy a big SD card, do it right when you order the camera.  You will want it.  With the large screen you will want to store plenty of picture and fun Video's to show all your friends.","This camera is VERY small.  It's also very light so you can put it in your pocket and bring it anywhere.  Boot up time is also incredibly fast.  It takes less than 1 second, which is considerably faster than my old Olympus C4000Z camera.  The features are nice and very easy to use.  I didn't need to look at the manual to figure out how to configure the camera the way I wanted.  Also, when they say long battery life, they aren't kidding.  You simply will not have to worry about the battery life even with the LCD on all the time!<br /><br />CONS:<br />Although LCD screen is huge, it's not as clear as other cameras out there.  I went to BestBuy with this camera and compared the LCD screen to Canon, Nikon, Kodak, and Sony and the difference was clear.  The LCD screen wasn't as sharp as the others and it was also a bit darker.  However, it looked a lot better than Sony DSC-T1, which is the smallest digital camera offered by Sony.  Also, it takes HORRIBLE indoor pictures especially when there aren't enough light (even with flash).  Lots of noise and it even shows on the LCD screen.  When I took pictures of my room at night, corners always looked blurry for some reason no matter what kind of settings I chose.  However, it took very nice outdoor pictures.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera to those that are looking for a fast, small camera with a long battery life.  Unlimited video mode feature is also a plus.  ;-)","If your looking for a good, pocket type camara with a lot of features, look no more. This camara is great. I love the quality and the awesome size. The battery is great, it lasts for 360 shots! The controls are great to, and the LCD is huge. Its bigger than most camara LCDs. Is shoots great movies(for a digital camara) and it can also has a recording voice feature. I love all the shots i've taken, they are alot better than my previous camara(Konica Minolta XG). The camara has a good grip for such a compact camara. You can put it in your pocket and take it anywhere. If your looking for a small, take it anywhere camara, with good photo quality and long battery life this is the camara for you.","I have been a Canon user all my life, and often recommend my customers to the Canon name (I work for a major electronics store in the camera department).  So initially I was a little leary at purchasing a Casio camera... but I am not at all disappointed in the quality.  Granted, I purchased it only two days ago, but I have taken over 70 pictures... and I am extremely impressed.  The macro mode is phenominal, better then that of the Canon S400, allowing me to get practically on top of a flower with a clear picture.  The other shooting modes on the camera are remarkable as well, even though I haven't had much of an oppurtunity to play with them.  For instance, there is a sunset mode, which adds a reddish filter to the image, there is a portrait mode which blurs the background adding an effect to the subject, a landscape mode, and some other fun tools that allow you to take pictures of fireworks, to stitch yourself into a picture if there are only two people, and a black and white as well as sepia filter.  The best part is the ease at accessing all of these modes.<br />Some of the best features I have seen from this camera are the battery, allowing the user to take over 300 pictures with one charge with the LCD running , the memory which by using SD allows the speed of taking pictures to be incredible, and of course, the  lens quality which is made by Pentax .  The actual size of the camera is what sets it apart from the rest- it's thin and compact, perfect for throwing into a shirt pocket, or a purse.<br />The only drawbacks I can see are the LCD in REALLY low light conditions tends to be a bit grainy, and the actual view finder itself is tough to use- especially for those who have vision problems- but since the camera is more or less designed to solely use the LCD, it works out. The only other recommendation I have is don't use the camera on normal mode- use it on fine if you want amazing quality pictures.  Otherwise you may notice a grainy quality.<br />The bottom line is whether you are a new user, a novice, or a professional, you will be impressed with the sleek style and professional quality this camera has to offer.  The average user will be impressed with the bonus features, and the person without a computer will be impressed with the editing abilities on the camera itself.  I can not speak enough about this camera, its docking cradle, or the features it contains (if you couldn't tell).  Its so intuitive- so user friendly, you have to wonder why other camera manufacturers haven't made it this easy.  I am glad to see that Casio is getting back into the market, and the Exilim Z40 is definately a phenominal product.  I hope if you purchase it, you enjoy it as much as I do.","This is my first digital camera. I was looking for something very small and nothing complicated. The large screen is perfect,and the quality of pictures taken is very good. And guess what, in my masters program with nine students, three of us are already using this camera. Way to go Casio, we just love yer!","This is my 5th Digital Camera, before I have Nikon 3100.<br />1. LCD great<br />2. Picture Great<br />3. Battery Great<br />4. Design & appearance Great<br />5. Price is Best<br />what else you need ? Need a Brand Name like Canon,Nikon, Sony - Go ahead.","i recently took this camera to London, Scotland and Florida, and it performed very well in all settings.  i will never go back to film, but i probably would have decided this regardless. anyway, this casio comes with many preset shots which work well. however, i found that playing with some of the settings manually also produces great pictures and once you find a group of setings that you like, you can save it as your own preset and call it up whenever you want.<br />the battery lasts forever.  for the average day of taking pictures, i never had a loss of power issue, in fact i don't remember the power bar going down much at all. i did charge the camera each night, so i can't say if the battery would have lasted mutliple days on one charge.<br />the large lcd screen is a big plus. a huge difference when compared to straining your eyes looking at the 1.5 in screens on most other cameras.<br />size was important as well because i wanted a camera that i could basically keep in my pocket and take out when i wanted to snap a few pictures and put it back and forget about it when hiking.<br />video mode works pretty well, after all, its not a video camera and would never substitute for one, but on the rare occasion when you need some quick video of a certain event, it comes in handy. a 512 MD card will give you about 30 minutes of video with audio.<br />i bought a 512MB SD card and had trouble filling it up after 9 days of shooting pictures. in mid quality mode, i was able to take over 330 pics.<br />i don't have many negatives.  maybe a better software package, but there are so many to choose from on the market. and if you are a serious photographer you can buy a decent one for $40. i would like to have a car charger for it, but i am sure casio or some other after market company is already working on it, so only a matter of time.<br />overall, great cam for the price, features and design. highky recommended.","First of all, I would like to correct the reviewer before me , yes there is a video mode in the US version (He/she probably confused it with the older EX-Z4U).  The video is not the greatest 15 fps (compared to the Sony T1's 30 fps), but I didn't buy a digicam for the video mode.  Anyways I have to say yes the picture quality is not the best, but it does the job.  I would give the picture quality a 4.2 out of 5 (and a Canon S500 a 4.5 out of 5, the Sony T1 couple decimals higher).  That said this camera suits my needs very well.  I had a tough decision of choosing from 1.)Canon S500 2.)Sony T1 3.)Casio EX-Z40....All of which are \"ultra-compact\" cameras.  I wanted something I could put in my pocket and use it as a point-and-shoot.  Now I will run through why I chose the Casio...<br />The Canon S500, was my \"runner-up\", I did not choose this camera because it had Compactflash (I wanted a camera that used \"SD\" (which is the Casio), because I had other gadgets that were compatible with SD...such as my Pocket PC.  The Sony T1 used the dreaded Memory sticks, which are basically compatible with only Sony products (don't get me wrong Sony makes some excellent products).  The S500 also had a smaller screen than the T1 and the Z40.  The T1 has a slightly bigger and better screen than the Z40.  Battery Life!!!  I wanted a camera with superb battery life which the Casio did, and the others did not.  With all that said I love my Casio EX-Z40.  Its not my dream camera, but its the closest thing to it.","The Exilim EX-Z40 is a small wonder to look at and hold ... and to actually use.  It's arguably the best-looking digital camera on the market today.  One look at it and you'll want to buy one.  The matching cradle is also just as \"cute.\"<br />Picture-quality-wise, it's good, but not as good as Canon's offerings.  There's a certain softness to the pictures it takes, and you cannot adjust the sharpness level like you can on many (admittedly larger) cameras.  The 2\" LCD is just totally wonderful, but does put on some drain on the dimunitive battery.<br />All in all, a pretty good package if a bit expensive.  It's definitely something you can impress a lot of people with.","For me, this camera is the classic double-edged sword.<br />On the one hand, it's great-looking, super-small, and fairly fast (with one exception... see below).  Its screen is everything you dream about.  Its menu system really is very well done: Casio obviously spent time designing the user interface, and the result is that deleting a poor shot is simple, turning off the flash is trivially easy... you get the idea.<br />But on the other hand, it's not quite the camera for me.  First, I just find it too small.  That's obviously subjective, but at a certain point, I find that something so tiny just doesn't have enough heft to stabilize the shot.  Second, while the camera is very fast outdoors, as soon as the flash comes into play, everything slows down quite a bit... and often the camera has a hard time focusing at all in \"low-light\" (ie, almost any indoor) situation.  Finally, when zoomed all the way out, you do get a bit of \"fish-eye\": vertical lines aren't quite vertical, but are bowed out a hair... again, I suspect, a function of its small size.<br />In a way, these are nits-- it's not what the dog says, but that the dog can talk at all.  Casio has packed a ton into a very small package, and if you're looking for a camera you can slip into any pocket and take to a ballgame or to the beach, this could be perfect.  But personally I'd be willing to take on a few more ounces in return for better indoor performance.","I read a lot of camera reviews before purchasing the Exilim EX-Z40.  The reasons I chose this model are: Speed, display screen size, camera size and battery life.  My experience so far has been very good.  The day I got my camera, I stowed it away in the front pocket of my casual shirt, (I could have fit two or three Exilims in there), and went to a t-ball game.  I snapped over 70 pictures in aboout 90 minutes.  The camera powers up fast (less than two seconds), and with outdoor light, photos can be taken one right after the other.  This allowed me to take two or three shots of a subject, and keep the shot I like.<br />Another positive is the overall ergonomics of this camera.  It looks cool, and just feels good in your hand.  All the controls are well placed, and the power on/off button is recessed, so as not to have the camera accidentally turned on in your bag or pocket.<br />The two inch display is nice, especially when using the on-screen menu.  The print size on the menu seems large because the menu is so big.  The downside of the large display is that Casio did not increase the resolution while expanding the display.  At around 85,000 pixels, the display is lacking the detail that will allow you to decide on the spot which pictures are good and which are great.  Sorting the bad from the good will have to be saved for the computer.<br />I was impressed with the quality of the photos I took with this camera, especially action shots.  I had feared that this camera would not take good action shots, however, I was wrong.  When I got home and ran the slide show on my PC, I was thrilled at the quality of the photos.  Some of them looked so real, I thought I was looking out a window, and not at my computer screen.  This camera definately produces photo quality images.  Another good surprise I had was the fact that of the ten or so indoor shots I took of people, not one of them had any hint of red eye.  Since almost all small digicams have problems with red eye, I assumed that would be the case, but so far, no red whatsoever - and I wasn't using the red eye reduction feature either!  I hope this holds true in the future. One thing about the indoor shots though - they were a bit grainy.<br />The docking cradle that comes with this camera is light, compact, simple to operate, and very functional.  After shooting all day, simply place your camera on the cradle, and with the press of only one button, you are watching the slide show of all your photos scroll by on your camera display or on your computer screen.  It really is that easy.  The cradle also charges the battery, and can send photos directly to your printer.  The negative on the cradle is that there is no AV output.  If you don't plan on viewing your photos on the TV, then it's no big deal.<br />The battery life on this camera is excellent as stated by Casio.<br />The full printed operating manual does not come with the camera.  You can read it on the provided CD ROM, or print the 180 page manually from the CD.<br />The only other negative I have is the fact that there is no review after capture with the display off, only with the display on.  Many cameras in this class have the review-after-capture feature, which allows the camera to be operated with the display off (battery saving) and when a photo is taken, it is displayed on the screen for two or three seconds, and then the display goes off again.  This is a nice feature that I wish this camera had.  Maybe it does, and I haven't found it yet.<br />Like many shoppers out there, I compared this camera to the Canon Elph before purchasing.  The Elph may have a slight edge on picture quality, but not much.  It does have an AV output.  The battery life will not come near to the Casio's, and the Canon has a goofy rubber cover over the AV and USB ports on the side of the camera.  This cover seems very flimsy, and is not secured well to the camera.  The Canon has good speed, but I'm not sure if it's as fast as the Casio.  The Canon can be pruchased a bit cheaper, but doesn't come with the cool cradle.  Either choice will do you well.<br />Overall, this little camera is a lot of fun, and will provide excellent photos for anyone who wants a pocketable, go-anywhere camera.","I just got my EX-Z40 two days ago. So far I am extremely impressed. The size is great for putting it in your pocket and going out or to a baseball game (like I did). Everyone who has seen it is really impressed with it.<br />The most impressive thing about the camera (besides the size) is the quick startup and shuter time. Don't underestimate this feature. I had an older 2 MP sony and the thing took forever to take a picture and I missed some really good photos because of the shutter delay. With the Casio's speedy shutter speed and startup time you won't miss that critical photo op. The picture takes nearly instantaneously when you hit the button. With the flash on it adds to the time between photos a little, but isn't bad at all comared to others.<br />The picture quality is good. I noticed a big difference in picture quality with the \"BestShot\" feature you had the camera on. I got some really bad ones when I didn't have it in macro mode with people up close. The toughest thing for me was to determine what mode to keep it in for most shots. But when I had the right photo type selected the pictures looked great...even at 1600 resolution.<br />The controls are very easy to use. The menus are very intuitive, and surprisingly the buttons aren't too small even for my big hands.<br />Also the battery life is amazingly long. I took 3 videos, approx. 50 pictures (many with flash and the LCD on the whole time) and the battery was still on 4/5 bars.<br />The camera is also packed with tons of extra features that are surprising to find on such a small camera. The additional feature of the video with sound is really cool, and the \"Best Shot\" can be really helpful (baring you understand each mode and when to use them well).<br />I would MOST HIGHLY recommend this camera to everyone. All in all it is a superb point & shoot carry along camera. This thing will get a ton of use with me.","I had 6 criteria when purchasing a new digital camera.<br />1st was ultra-compact size.  The casio is perfect.  Small as can be.  Only pentax smaller but battery, speed are better on casio.<br />2nd.  Battery life can not suffer due to size.  This battery lasts forever.  I started and stopped this camera a dozen times taking 10 pictures at a time, half with flash, all with LCD, and it still has power left.  I am amazed by this power management.<br />One important point.  If you battery runs out you are done.  You must put camera on usb docking station to recharge.  Battery is proprietary.  Casio offers a rapid charger for those who need it.  Battery normally takes 190 minutes to fully charge.<br />3rd.  Simple to use.. I understand all the settings of manual mode but implementing them can be too difficult.  The casio was easy plus it has the BEST SHOT feature.  Pick your scenaio.  For example PORTRAIT, SCENERY, CANDLELIGHT, etc...  It automatically sets the basic settings (ISO, Exposure, White Balance, Focus) based on the BEST SHOT selection you make.<br />4th Speed.  I'm tired of missing things.  I want fast finger to snap shutter speed.  This camera is great.  Even shot to shot is very good.<br />5th. Picture Quality.  This is highly debateable.  Without comparison I though the pictures were good.  Next to a high quality camera I noticed issues with sharpness and graininess.  But before comparing I thought pictures were good.<br />6th.  Low light.  Does very good compared to other cameras at this size.  Not as good as Larger.. But I was pleasantly suprised.<br />One big bonus.  If you host your own website this camera during usb connection can not only copy the pictures onto your computer, but it will also design web pages with your pictures on it.  I really liked this feature.<br />I was seriously looking at Canon SD-110,  Canon's Picture quality is better.  Also SD-110 does 640x480 movies.  Casio only does 320x240.  But I wanted a really small camera.  And though the Canon is compact it is not ultra-compact like the casio. Overall I recommend this product.","I've just recently received the Casio Exilim EX-Z4 camera.  I had a chance to play around with its functions...so far so good....It was so easy to toggle its menu and display items.  Captures images very well in various light levels.  However, the pix. display is a tad bit distorted even though it is shown on the unit's large 2\" LCD screen...which by the way takes up almost 2/3 of the back side of the unit. I think this is a great starter camera with many functions that are more than useful for the non-professionals. If you want a user-friendly point and shoot with a more than decent lens aperature then this is a camera for you!  Despite its price tag being pretty unattractive right now, I'm pretty sure you are getting what you paid for.<br />Overall, I am very delighted that Casio put this model onto their market...I was just about to pick up the EX-Z4U."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix A120","amazon_reviews":["This is my 5-th digital camera and 3-rd Finepix, after Finepix1300, have FinepixS602ZPro and bought this one for the size and quality.

My first one 'disappeared' during a concert after having served faithfully for 2 years.  I even took pictures of a fireworks display while on a business trip.  Found out a 256M card could only hold 222 picture-after-picture shots (took 2 batteries to do this).  I have a 1GB card in my present SL400R, and I always have extra batteries with me.  Due to its fast power up, I've been able to capture some of those 'Kodak moment' photos I would otherwise have missed (much to our secretary's dismay).  I carry it everywhere, and there's always someone who marvels at the rotating lens.  They really are impressed when I show them you can turn the lens the other way, it 'flips' the image, and you correctly see what you are shooting when doing a 'self pix'!<br />  Having the camera conveniently in my shirt pocket while no one knows it's there has to be the best feature, followed closely by the quick power on.  I have 4 family members who now have this camera.  They like it's point and shoot ease, as well as the convenience of this small, yet powerful camera.","I've had tons of fun with my 'spy' cam but am putting it out to pasture because of the battery situation.  Worked well the first half year, then before the warranty expired I sent it in, they didn't tell me what they did, it improved and then returned to the same problem even after I bought a new battery.  I don't get many photos or much play with photo review and zoom before the battery gets sucked down to nothing.","I've had this camera for over a year now (purchased from Radio Shack for $235) and have loved the compact portability, features, and picture quality.  Sure its picture quality cannot compare with my film camera, a Minolta XD11 (SLR purchased in 1978) with several intercahngable lens, but what digital camera can?  I wanted a digital camera that I could put in my pocket and not worry about - not my usual semi-pro 230 mm focal length behemoth (camera with telephot lens) swinging from my neck and requiring a trip to the local film processor.  On the golf course, hiking the forest, around the yard, at family reunions, parties, special events, this little wonder can be pulled out of a jacket or pants pocket, powered up and the photo captured before anyone knows you have a camera in hand.  When taking pictures of my sons running track, I found the rapid fire picture taking especially useful - capturing every nuance of one son soaring over the high jump.  Picture quality, although not as good as a film camera, matches some 6 and 8 Megapixel cameras.

My first one 'disappeared' during a concert after having served faithfully for 2 years.  I even took pictures of a fireworks display while on a business trip.  Found out a 256M card could only hold 222 picture-after-picture shots (took 2 batteries to do this).  I have a 1GB card in my present SL400R, and I always have extra batteries with me.  Due to its fast power up, I've been able to capture some of those 'Kodak moment' photos I would otherwise have missed (much to our secretary's dismay).  I carry it everywhere, and there's always someone who marvels at the rotating lens.  They really are impressed when I show them you can turn the lens the other way, it 'flips' the image, and you correctly see what you are shooting when doing a 'self pix'!<br />  Having the camera conveniently in my shirt pocket while no one knows it's there has to be the best feature, followed closely by the quick power on.  I have 4 family members who now have this camera.  They like it's point and shoot ease, as well as the convenience of this small, yet powerful camera.","I've had tons of fun with my 'spy' cam but am putting it out to pasture because of the battery situation.  Worked well the first half year, then before the warranty expired I sent it in, they didn't tell me what they did, it improved and then returned to the same problem even after I bought a new battery.  I don't get many photos or much play with photo review and zoom before the battery gets sucked down to nothing.","I've had this camera for over a year now (purchased from Radio Shack for $235) and have loved the compact portability, features, and picture quality.  Sure its picture quality cannot compare with my film camera, a Minolta XD11 (SLR purchased in 1978) with several intercahngable lens, but what digital camera can?  I wanted a digital camera that I could put in my pocket and not worry about - not my usual semi-pro 230 mm focal length behemoth (camera with telephot lens) swinging from my neck and requiring a trip to the local film processor.  On the golf course, hiking the forest, around the yard, at family reunions, parties, special events, this little wonder can be pulled out of a jacket or pants pocket, powered up and the photo captured before anyone knows you have a camera in hand.  When taking pictures of my sons running track, I found the rapid fire picture taking especially useful - capturing every nuance of one son soaring over the high jump.  Picture quality, although not as good as a film camera, matches some 6 and 8 Megapixel cameras.  I know this because some pictures, taken of events where such other digital cameras are used, were selected superior and used by the people who took photographs using the other cameras.

The size is great, very thin, but still easy to hold steadily.","I just recieved this camera today, and right out of the box it impressed me. First of all this camera is tiny. It's about the same length and width as my Palm Tungsten E, and only a little bit thicker. The rotating lens is a very cool feature, and makes it easy to take self portraits. I also bought a Sandisk Ultra II 512 MB SD card, and it works greats, especially for the high speed mode. The zoom works well, and is relatively easy to operate while pressing down the shutter. The auto focus takes a little getting used to as you have to hold the shutter button down halfway. Connecting it to my Windows XP computer was easy and required no software installation. I highly recommend that you use the included Adobe Photoshop Album software. Image quality seemed good to my relatively untrained eye, and an 8 1/2 by 11 print from my printer came out very nicely. Overall this is an excellent camera with a small size, good pictures, and a great wow factor.","i like the camera. photos are good and its compact. i got what i paid for. the minuses are bad photos in low light and the lcd screen does not show you the true quality of the photo. i use sony software when i put on pc and hit autoadjust and the photos in low light look alot better. dont be afraid to buy this camera if its what you are after.","When purchasing a compact digital camera (fits in your pocket, without the case), I expected to forfeit some quality. To my surprise, this camera contained all that I needed and more. It's also quite adaptable - transition quickly from taking poster-size prints to smaller file sizes used mainly for internet sharing. Zoom in on any picture you've already taken, making your own thumbnail right on the camera - no fancy program necessary! The video and sound quality is excellent - the length of video limited only to the size of your memory card. Scene modes (portrait, sports, night shots, macro and more...) make taking quality pictures simple for those who don't want to sort through a bunch of different settings.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for any digital camera user - even those not particularly interested in a lightweight.","The best thing about the Kyocera sl400r is the size. To get a camera this small results in some compromises, so image quality and ease of use are compromised. That's true of all cameras in this size class.  In terms of volume, the Pentax Optio S4i is smaller, and the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T1 and Konica Minolta DiMAGE Xt are slightly larger. The Kyocera sl400r offers 640 x 480 30fps video quality until the card is full, which is as good or better than any of the other cameras (though the quality of sound from the built in mic isn't great). The menu lay-out is intuitive and you won't need to refer to the manual very often. Start-up and shot-to-shot time are best in the class as well.  If you buy a fast Secure Data card (I got a 1Gb Kingmax 60x SD card for a little over $100 that works great), the Kyocera can shoot at 3.5 frames/second until the card is full, far beyond the capabilities of other cameras in this class.  On the down side, low light performance is poor, there is no optical viewfinder, battery life is short (extra Kyocera batteries are $75, though you can fine generic replacement batteries for $25) and the lack of a lens cover makes the lens a fingerprint magnet. I find I use mine mostly for video.  My 1Gb Kingmax card will give me 7 and half minutes of video at 640 x 480 30 fps, or 30 minutes at the 320x240 30fps setting. It's a great gadget that fits easily in your pocket, but it won't replace your slr.","I'm not an expert photographer, I'm barely a photo enthusiast and I love this camera!<br /><br />Even in it's carrying case, it's smaller than my wallet. I can take it anywhere, even places that don't allow cameras. Because the camera is so small, the controls are small. It takes some time to get used to, but well worth it (unless you're arthritic).<br /><br />This camera is fast! There is almost no start-up time and very little processing time between shots. Just turn it on and you're ready to go, which is great for spare-of-the-moment pictures.<br /><br />Because it takes less time to load, it doesn't eat the battery as much. I don't feel the need to keep it on for long periods of time, \"just in case I miss something\". Also, the battery is easily rechargable. Just plug the camera into a wall socket. I may invest in another battery in case I go hiking or camping, but for day to day use the battery seems just fine.<br /><br />I'm only taking snap shots, so I'm satisfied with the image quality. All the default settings have been working fine for me. If I was entering photo contests and actually understood compression, ISO and all that other stuff, then I would go for a bulkier, higher end camera.<br /><br />There is no lens cover, but the hood and the included case (which fit's like a glove) does a great job avoiding dust and fingerprints. It also comes with a little lens cleaner in case someone sticks their digits in there.<br /><br />The only downside (and I use that word lightly) I can think of is the included memory card. 16 Megs is really nothing more than a tease. Like all the other reviews say; get a high capacity, high speed SD card (makes sure it says \"high-speed\", \"32X\" or something like that) and you'll be ready to shoot plenty of continuous shots (great for sports) and movies.","I've been researching for some time for an ultra-compact digital camera to take with me while on vacation or whenever I might need to \"capture the moment\". I already have a decent all-around digital camera but wanted an inexpensive compact to carry with me most of the time. I really wanted to get the Casio Exilim Z40 but the picture quality just wasn't up to par after viewing the samples on some of the digital cameral review sites. So after checking out the SL400R's sample images, I decided to give it a shot (especially with Amazon's overall lowest price and the $50 gift certificate to seal the deal).<br /><br /> My wife and I went to Vegas last week and I had the opportunity to put the camera through the test. I can honestly say this cameral rivals my Nikon for outdoor shots. The colors were much more vibrant and the images were sharper. And when I print the images on my Epson RX500, you would think I had a photo lab print the shots. The only downfall is the quality of indoor pics with low lighting. The prints appear grainy and not well illuminated. But I didn't purchase this for indoor shooting. The only other downside to this camera is that it doesn't include a lens cover. You do get a compact camera case but that does add to the bulk a bit. I just made sure I carried around the included lens cleaner stick that's included for those times I chose not to put the camera in its case.<br /><br /> Overall, I couldn't be happier with this camera. Every time I bring it out, it draws oohs and ahhs from the people around me - it's so small, very stylish and best of all has the rotating body to shoot those hard to reach shots. This cameral was well worth my small investment!","Quite an amazing camera for the size. This Kyocera is capable of producing some fine detail in photos and does all this with speed that is usually not found in smaller pocket units.<br />I normally use the large Sony 828 which is far removed from a pocket camera but Kyocera gives many of the features of a mid range camera in a compact size. The Kyocera SL400R fills the need for a smaller unit and at 4MP it can produce close to the same quality for routine use. Focus can sometimes present a challenge but overall, this is worth a look. For it's size and capabilites, this Kyocera is gives an easy five-star performance.","First off, I'm extremely pleased with this little camera.  Does it have shortfalls?  Yes, but not many.  I bought this camera for specific reasons and it performs 100% of what I want it to do.<br />I'm in the military and on the go quite a bit so I needed something small and easy to use.<br />One of the biggest pluses (to me) is not needing a tripod.  The swivel body is perfect for setting about anywhere and getting the shot (of myself) wherever I am.  No more balancing my camera on a pile of rocks till I get the lens angle to where it doesn't cut my head off in the picture.<br />The instant on feature is awesome.  Turn it on and it's ready to shoot a picture.<br />The fast shoot is the best thing ever.  I can't tell you how many pictures I've missed with my other camera because it's focusing and processing whatever information.  Push the button and it takes a picture, not \"takes a picture 2 seconds from now.\"<br />WIth a high speed card you can take really great 640 x (whatever) movies.  The movies are good quality and full motion.  Not a camcorder replacement but fun for taking action movies at the drag races or whatever.<br />I haven't had problems with battery life.  I think for the size and intended use it's fine.  I turn the camera on, take a pic and turn it off.  If you leave it on constantly, yeah, it's going to drain the battery.  With the instant on and fast shooting, you can turn it on, take a pic and turn it off before most cameras can take a pic with it already on.<br />With the camera being so small, I don't mind taking my camera everywhere with me.  It's nice because I'm taking pictures of a lot of things I never felt like lugging a camera around to take pictures of.<br />I've got Windows XP and there have been no problems (as stated earlier).  Give your battery a full charge before you first start playing with it.  I bought an extra battery but I don't think it's going to get much use.  Don't forget to buy a high speed SD card.  I got a 512m 32x speed and I think it will work for about anything I need.  You could probably get away with a 256m no prob though.<br />Overall, I think it's an awesome little camera.  If it had a little bit better zoom it would be perfect.  It's an everyday camera.  Fun to use.<br />It's not a replacement for my other camera though and I didn't buy it with those intentions.  Keep that in mind and you will be extremely pleased.","I liked a lot of things about this camera, but had to return it for the following reasons.  First, it has no lens cover, so it is not a good idea to carry it around in a pocket unless you also carry around something to clean the lens.  Second, for some reason my very modern and up-to-date home computer (Windows XP) would not recognize the camera as a USB removable drive as the manual said it should, so I was unable to retrieve the pictures I'd taken at home.  Finally, once I was able to download the pictures to a work computer, I did not see a marked improvement in picture quality over the pictures my old Canon S230 takes.  Another negative is that charging the battery requires hooking the camera up to a 2-piece AC adaptor-like cable. Compared to the kind of charger that the Canon digicams come with (a small plastic unit that holds the battery and plugs right into the wall), this seemed like a step backwards. On the plus side, this camera is small, has lots of functionality I hadn't seen in a digicam before (\"Portrait,\" \"Sports\" modes, can take multiple continuous pictures, movie modes, etc.), is very easy to use, and also the manual was extremely useful and easy to read.","In a rather negative review, an earlier entry indicated very poor battery life.  I will admit that it would be good to have an extra battery or two, but let me share with you the very first (quite positive) experience we had.<br />The camera arrived on a Friday and after a few quick calculations I ran out and bought a 512Meg memory chip.  Then the charger was hooked up and I handed the instruction guide to my wife and said - \"go to it\".  We were having the annual show of our barbershop chorus the next day and she was going to take some pictures.<br />She brought the camera and took about 25 photos of the cast in preparation for the show, and then switched to movie mode (using the lowest resolution - to get as much as would fit on the chip) and took about 200Megs of a movie (about 20 minutes) before the battery ran out of gas.<br />I'm not sure what the prior reviewer's problem was, but that was a single battery and one full charge.<br />As to the quality, because the lighting was limited to the available stage lighting, the pictures were very grainy.  VERY.  But that is to be expected in low light.  The sound was acceptable and we have an archive copy of what the start of the show looked like.  Not bad for a first attempt.<br />A few more cautions - the multiple photo option is great but I have a tendency to move the camera while pressing the button.  This \"user error\" causes the photos to be blurry.  So when using that mode I'd recommend finding a place to rest the camera or something to lean against to avoid problems.<br />So with those caveats, I'd recommend this camera to anyone who wants to have a camera that can be slipped into a pocket or purse and used at a moments notice.","Image quality:<br />Daytime images: Excellent image quality, that fully meets expectations of a 4M pixel camera.<br />Flashimages: There is a built in flash, that allows taking pictures over reasonable distances (2 to 4 m). Unfortunately the autofocus works poorly under dim light conditions and there is no built in light assist autofocus. Fortunately the camera comes with a built in manual focus so that you can always use the camera.<br />A major adavantge of the camera over any other ultracompact is the swivel body. Thanks to the swivel body you will be able to put the camera on any flat surface or hold it onto a poll etc so that you can take night time images and self timer images without a tripod. I like this, because I seldom carry a tripod with me - in particular when I go out with a compact camera.<br />Another major advantage of the camera is the optional filter thread. This way you finally have a compact camera that permits you to add polarizer filters etc that used to be the privilege of larger cameras. (Polarizer filters are used to filter white glares from the sun that take away quite a bit of the colors).<br />Video quality: The quality of the videos you can take with this camera will suprise you (30 fps with 640x480 dots). You may take video clips of any length - of course this takes memory. The only thing I found is the somehow grainy video quality under dim light conditions. Yet, all of my other cameras have the same issue to some extent.<br />To refill the battery you only need to attach the power cord to the camera without extracting the battery or needing a cradle. The camera has the standard small USB connector, which makes directly downloading images without card reader very convenient. Kyocera provides the USB to small USB converter cable within the package.<br />All the features are easily accessible and conveniently located.<br />It is hard to say which of the two cameras, the Sony DSC-T1 or the Kyocera Finecam SL400R is any better without performing a in-depth test series.From what I have read and from what I see now from the Kyocera, I tend to believe that the Kyocera can keep up or exceed the image quality. However, the swivel body and the optional lens makes this camera way more versatile then the Sony."]},{"name":"Kyocera Finecam M410R","amazon_reviews":["I LIKE THIS CAMERA!!!I dont know very much about digital cameras,but after having this one for several weeks now,I cant imagine what an average digital camera is.I have used my 35mm Minolta for many years,and decided to get a digital.After exaustive research on Amazon and several other sites,i bought this one.It came from Willoughby's in New York City, all the way across the country from where i live.They helped me a lot to understand the camera after i bought it from them.My very first picture from this camera is on my desk top in my computer,17\"x17\".It is just as clear and crisp as the regular size picture is.I find that the manuals are easy to read,and are written for the average person to understand.The zoom on it is just one of the greatest parts of the camera.you can never have too much zoom.Anything less would not be adequate.the sequential picture mode is very fast,and CLEAR.The pictures load into my computer very fast and is easy to understand.For the money it is a great camera that rivals those costing a lot more.The more i use it, the more features i find,and how to use them.","I LIKE THIS CAMERA!!!I dont know very much about digital cameras,but after having this one for several weeks now,I cant imagine what an average digital camera is.I have used my 35mm Minolta for many years,and decided to get a digital.After exaustive research on Amazon and several other sites,i bought this one.It came from Willoughby's in New York City, all the way across the country from where i live.They helped me a lot to understand the camera after i bought it from them.My very first picture from this camera is on my desk top in my computer,17\"x17\".It is just as clear and crisp as the regular size picture is.I find that the manuals are easy to read,and are written for the average person to understand.The zoom on it is just one of the greatest parts of the camera.you can never have too much zoom.Anything less would not be adequate.the sequential picture mode is very fast,and CLEAR.The pictures load into my computer very fast and is easy to understand.For the money it is a great camera that rivals those costing a lot more.The more i use it, the more features i find,and how to use them."]},{"name":"Casio Exilim EX-P600","amazon_reviews":["I bought this camera over two years ago and it still works as good as when I first bought it. Great picture quality and easy to use. Some features can be pretty hard to understand but those features you only need to mess with if your a pro. Just charge it and go. Great Product!!!!","I love this thing!<br /><br />I am a first-time digital camera buyer and really a novice to photography.  I wanted to find a camera that wasn't to big and that was most importantly easy to use.  When researching my purchase I made the decision to obtain a camera that has a larger than 3X Optical Zoom - this narrows down the list considerablely.<br /><br />It came down to the Casio P600, Fuji E550, and Pentax Optio SV. I loved the compact size of the Optio and its 5X zoom. What killed it for me was it's painfully slow shutter lag. This may not bother some, but it really got to me.<br /><br />The Fuji E550 is a great camera (very fast),  but ultimately there were a couple of things I did not like. One was the fact that it only has a maximum 3 sec shutter exposure. I think this is really sad. If not for this, I would have bought it.  The other is that the interface, much like the Pentax takes some deciphering.<br /><br />This is why I bought the Casio.  From the moment I picked it up, it felt comfortable.  All of the buttons are where they should be. Everything is very very intuitive. I STILL haven't cracked the manual and I feel very confident that I know how to work almost all of the functions.  Being a novice to digital photography, I did not know what the different icons meant, what the differnt options could do.  If it isn't obvious from the Casio's excellent interface, it explains it for you! Don't know what a faster shutter speed will do for your picture? Don't worry, the P600 will show you an example.<br /><br />There are 25 best scene modes (most are pretty gimmicky), but all are well explained on the large 2\" screen.  It has a 60 second maximum shutter opening resulting in some eye-popping night time and low light images. Add this is a great burst mode (continous is a bit slow clocking in at just under one per second, but the hi-speed is really great firing off as many as 6 images in two seconds)<br /><br />Battery life is also great.  The first two days I had the camera the screen was on constantly as I was perusing the menus, exploring the different options and reviewing pictures.  I didn't have to recharge until the end of the 2nd day.<br /><br />In short, the P600 has an excellent interface, sturdy design, intuitive controls. The only negatives for me were an awkward off-center tripod mount, and the unusual bulging lens that made packing and unpacking the camera from its carrying case (sold separately) a bit clunky.<br /><br />All in all a really great camera.","I am an advanced amateur photographer who uses a Hasselblad and a large format Wista.  I had previously owned a Canon Powershot S100 which was ok but I found the battery life was terrible.  I carried 4 batteries with me at all times to make it through one day.  When I found the Casio Exilim I was so impressed, as time has gone by I am more impressed.  I rarely have to charge the battery and I take hundreds of pictures and videos with it.  I never worry that the battery will die in the middle of an event.  I use a 1GB SD card which allows me almost one hour of video.  It takes incredible photos, professional quality yet is still small enough to carry in my bag.  The preset settings are fun to use and I have created some beautiful portraits.

The P600 is my second digicam. I use a Nikon D100 for serious work, shoot in the RAW mode, edit on a color profiled monitor with Photoshop and print on a 6 color photo printer. I've owned 5 digicams over the last 8 years-none were perfect. There is always a trade-off when seeking portability, lens quality,speed, feature, ruggedness, low noise and resolution. At this time the CASIO P600 is the leader: 6 megapixels, 4x optical zoom high quality Canon lens, small size in a rugged body,quick startup, good ergonomics, big (2inches) viewing screen,unlimited movie mode, advanced menus and extensive features etc. This is the best compact digicam I've owned to date. Drawbacks: CASIO's somewhat spotty reputation for service,lack of a printed manual, relatively small amount of on-board memory, expensive proprietary battery (many others have this problem viz: Nikon, Canon etc.), limited software, inaccessable RAW mode, non-standard USB connection, lack of flash shoe (Canon G5 has one-Casio does have external flash sync) and few other nit-picky concerns. I considered the Olympus 5060 but it was bigger and bulkier, had less optical zoom, and lower resolution. It was close. You need to decide what features are important. I would point out that comments by other reveiwers about the lack of a memory card and difficulty with the USB connector suggest that they were very new to the experience of using digicams and might have been happier with a less expensive, simpler rig.","This camera has great features [and a 247 page CD-ROM manual] but is also easy to use without all the special settings.  However, less than 2 weeks after I got it, the USB port broke while attaching the cable to download images - this happened even when using the supplied cable & being careful to insert it in the correct way.  Now I may have to send it to their one US warranty center, in NJ, for repair.  There is another review here with a similar complaint, & others elsewhere [now that I've had this problem & looked], so it's obviously not an isolated problem.","Ok I do like this camera very much, it has a lot of really good features, however the one disapointment I had was when i opened it up and there was no memory card, from what i can see you can get about 3 pictures on the camera with out memory card, but come on 3 pictures. So if you are interested in buying this camera please remember you kind of have to buy a memory card along with it.","I bought this camera, after a long, extensive, detailed search, to replace my venerable Casio QV-4000. I originally shyed away from another Casio because they are not a mainstream player in the camera market. But after a few rounds of re-evaluating what my priorities and needs were, this one met all my requirements for a replacement:<br />- (Much) Faster startup, shutdown, and between-shot times<br />- No lens cap!<br />- Much smaller and lighter than the QV-4000<br />- More zoom<br />- Larger image<br />- Good quality optics<br />- No loss of manual controls<br />- LCD is actually usable in direct sunlight!<br />This one has all those features, plus several new and other things I might not have even thought of. Probably one of the most useful, after the bigger zoom, bigger CCD and faster startup, will be the ease in *getting at* the various controls. Though you can point and shoot just like any camera, you can make all sorts of settings with remarkably few button pushes.<br />A reviewer elsewhere mentioned how this camera doesn't use the CF memory format of the older Casios. Duh, look at the size of the camera! It's amazingly small, considering what it packs. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of a paper manual in the box. You have to read it off your computer or use a ton of paper to print it. Notice you can download it here from Amazon to find out a lot about the camera.<br />It starts and behaves very fast. Scrolling through photos in playback is lightning fast. I also like the *small* battery charger, and the fact that it doesn't have a big annoying cord. Just plug it straight into the wall; great for travel!<br />I like the large 2\" LCD. I could see it fine outside on a sunny day. It has plenty of resolution for my 42 year old eyes. It would be nice if it could zoom in a little closer, but 8x is good. I also like the Best Shot feature, where the soft focus mode is very cool. Also having fun with the high-speed modes, including the one that makes 25 tiny pictures in very rapid succession on a single frame.<br />There is also a feature carried over from my older Casio, which I didn't see mentioned in any reviews. The flash does have three power levels. This is great if you want to \"overflash\" a subject that's further from the camera, or lighten it up for some gentle fill.<br />Highly recommended if you like a camera with lots of controls and features. I'm sure this is currently the most functionality you can get in a camera of this size with these major features.<br />If you're like me you need a decent-sized card. Get the Sandisk Ultra II. Best price from a reputable vendor I found right here. Also an extra battery, though the one that comes with it is supposed to be long-lasting.<br />Some weak points:<br />- Though I hated the dangling lens cap on my previous camera, I worry about the delicate lens shutter on this one. Certainly not as strong or protective from dust and moisture as a cap, but that's what a case or bag is for.<br />- Flash is a little weak, with short range. I guess this is to be expected from a tiny camera.<br />- Folder and filenames no longer have the date in them. This was real handy with my older pictures. Wherever you stuck one, you could always reference when it was taken.<br />- No user-friendly RAW mode. Though you can access it through an undocumented diagnostic and setup menu, there is no common software to work with the files. It would be nice if Casio enabled this.<br />That list is all minor stuff for me. My rating of 4.5 is just to say there's room for improvement, which is always true. I'm glad I chose this camera, even though the price has already dropped $30 in the week or so since I ordered it. Oh the fun of being an early adopter!","You know when you buy something, having a high expectation, and when you get it, you're still amazed at how great it is?  For me, this happened when I bought this camera.  I knew this camera would be small, fast, and loaded with a ton of features, but I didn't know just how great it would be.<br /> I wasn't actually shopping for a 6MP camera, but all of the 5MP compact cameras really didn't cut it.  But the combination of features on the EX-P600, combined with the 4x Optical Zoom (16x Digital) and 2.0\" LCD said go for it.  But when I started using the camera I realized I made a really smart move.  Casio obviously spent a great deal of time coming up with an intuitive interface to access everything. In just a few steps you can set any feature on the camera, and the 2.0\" LCD screen offers enough real estate to know what your doing.<br />In simple point and shoot mode, the EX-P600 offers great pictures with little wait time between shots.  Auto focus is a snap, and you don't need to think about anything else.  I like the Best Shot mode, which lets you select from 25 different presets for optimal results in various settings.  Portrait, Nighttime, scenery, etc..  It even has a coupling mode so you can take a picture of your friend, and have your friend take a picture of you, and have it be the same image.  No more asking somebody to take your picture!<br /> If you want to get really into it, pretty much everything on the camera- focusing, exposure, white balance, color filters, are adjustable.  You can even create custom presets and have it show up in best shot mode. You can not only access everything from a Menu, but it has a quick settings button where you can tab thru all the current camera settings.<br /> Some downsides are the camera doesn't come with an SD card, so you have to buy one separately, which adds on to the price tag.  Also, it doesn't come with an AC Adapter, just an external charger, so you have to take the battery out to of the camera to charge it, unless you get the AC Adapter.  It also has an \"ex\" mode where all this data comes up when you take a picture.  The plus side is you can see all the settings on the screen, the downside is it looks like you're flying an F-16.  But you don't have to have it on, the regular mode tells you everything you need to know.<br /> All in all, if you want a camera to last a couple of years, this is yet.  The high resolution 6MP CCD will offer room when higher resolution printers come out, and the advanced feature set will let you have more creative control when you're ready for it, but it's not even too hard to figure out. This is a really smart camera, not just a good one.  This camera even has a remote control, so no more running into the picture and wondering when the flash will be for those group shots!","I bought this camera over two years ago and it still works as good as when I first bought it. Great picture quality and easy to use. Some features can be pretty hard to understand but those features you only need to mess with if your a pro. Just charge it and go. Great Product!!!!","I love this thing!<br /><br />I am a first-time digital camera buyer and really a novice to photography.  I wanted to find a camera that wasn't to big and that was most importantly easy to use.  When researching my purchase I made the decision to obtain a camera that has a larger than 3X Optical Zoom - this narrows down the list considerablely.<br /><br />It came down to the Casio P600, Fuji E550, and Pentax Optio SV. I loved the compact size of the Optio and its 5X zoom. What killed it for me was it's painfully slow shutter lag. This may not bother some, but it really got to me.<br /><br />The Fuji E550 is a great camera (very fast),  but ultimately there were a couple of things I did not like. One was the fact that it only has a maximum 3 sec shutter exposure. I think this is really sad. If not for this, I would have bought it.  The other is that the interface, much like the Pentax takes some deciphering.<br /><br />This is why I bought the Casio.  From the moment I picked it up, it felt comfortable.  All of the buttons are where they should be. Everything is very very intuitive. I STILL haven't cracked the manual and I feel very confident that I know how to work almost all of the functions.  Being a novice to digital photography, I did not know what the different icons meant, what the differnt options could do.  If it isn't obvious from the Casio's excellent interface, it explains it for you! Don't know what a faster shutter speed will do for your picture? Don't worry, the P600 will show you an example.<br /><br />There are 25 best scene modes (most are pretty gimmicky), but all are well explained on the large 2\" screen.  It has a 60 second maximum shutter opening resulting in some eye-popping night time and low light images. Add this is a great burst mode (continous is a bit slow clocking in at just under one per second, but the hi-speed is really great firing off as many as 6 images in two seconds)<br /><br />Battery life is also great.  The first two days I had the camera the screen was on constantly as I was perusing the menus, exploring the different options and reviewing pictures.  I didn't have to recharge until the end of the 2nd day.<br /><br />In short, the P600 has an excellent interface, sturdy design, intuitive controls. The only negatives for me were an awkward off-center tripod mount, and the unusual bulging lens that made packing and unpacking the camera from its carrying case (sold separately) a bit clunky.<br /><br />All in all a really great camera.","I am an advanced amateur photographer who uses a Hasselblad and a large format Wista.  I had previously owned a Canon Powershot S100 which was ok but I found the battery life was terrible.  I carried 4 batteries with me at all times to make it through one day.  When I found the Casio Exilim I was so impressed, as time has gone by I am more impressed.  I rarely have to charge the battery and I take hundreds of pictures and videos with it.  I never worry that the battery will die in the middle of an event.  I use a 1GB SD card which allows me almost one hour of video.  It takes incredible photos, professional quality yet is still small enough to carry in my bag.  The preset settings are fun to use and I have created some beautiful portraits.  The menus are extremely user friendly even if you don't want to read the manual.  It has a solid feel to it and even comes with a remote control.

A dead sensor was replaced and the camera was as new.<br />Most cameras are pretty forgettable. This is one that I keep coming back to, that I miss after a period of non-use. It can produce, one after the other, the most beautiful images. I use it often for still objects, indoors, under natural light. Straight out of the camera, the images have a unique look, often needing little or no post-processing at all. I have had stunning results just shooting on a tripod, on fully automatic. Landscapes, portraits, street work are all areas in which the LC1 also delivers.<br />I've owned both the Digilux 2 and this. I sold the former because the LC1 is more personal to me and, at that time, was in pristine condition: I like the all-black finish better; the slightly rubberised areas make it far less slippery to hold than the D2. It is retro, without being a relic. The whole machine is of excellent build quality. It feels solid and tough. Everything slots, turns and clicks perfectly.<br /><br />The lens.<br /><br />Leica Vario - Summicron, 28mm-90mm.<br />f2 - f2.4.<br /><br />I don't know how many, if any, 28-90mm zooms are as fast as this, never mind Leica ones. It is spectacular, the heart of the camera.<br /><br />Allow for its shortcomings, which are only relative to much newer cameras. It may be old but it's not humbled by any other camera. This is a superb image-making instrument.<br /><br />I have to agree with the statement that Panasonic and Leica were way ahead of their time with the LC1. It is a classic.","I've written extensively on this camera and the digilux 2 online on my own blog.<br /><br />This camera and the digilux 2 are considered true classic cameras, and a decade later they still do not dissapoint the discerning photographer who embraces the foundation of principles and fundamentals that make photography a rewarding experience.<br /><br />This camera design is truly unique- one of a kind. Dismissed by the masses but embraced by a very niche group of photographers that desire a camera to be both a design first priority, and, a work of art- at the very same time.<br /><br />The lens of this camera, its manual controls, its bright aperture, internal zoom, build quality, and ultimately its excellent performance- are the heart of its lure and soul of its operation. The body style, and external controls compliment this lens design perfectly. Its size is both large enough to operate manually without being cramped, and small enough to be carried anywhere all day long without fatigue in any way.<br /><br />It's sensor is excellent still to this day, 5mp actually translates to the resolution output of many 10mp sensors because of how sharp this lens is. So don't be swayed by that specification. While this camera's operational speed is pedestrian compared to many of today's cameras, its that exact quality which endears it to owners of it. The mere fact that this camera in some ways is inadequate (compared to faster DSLRS) to a variety of shooting circumstances forces the photographer to think his/her way through the process. Thus a shot well done grants the photographer a proud achievement.<br /><br />This is in stark contrast to using a DSLR where shooting a burst of images with a blazing fast autofocus and burst rate yeild one good image out of many.<br /><br />It's EVF and LCD are adequate, and with some practice can become intuitive to the shooters needs. The short range of ISO (compared to today's cameras) is also adequate considering the lens fast aperture, and the fact that it yields sharp images wide open. When you do the math you'll see that a comparable DSLR kit would need to use an ISO speed two stops or more higher than this camera to get the same shutter speed.<br /><br />The build quality of this camera, its handling, are first rate. Leica spearheaded its design (both cameras) and Panasonic provided the production capability and electronics. Don't be fooled into believing that this is a Panasonic design first and foremost. Its actually the other way around.<br /><br />This camera and its twin, continue to hold value extremely well. Most digital cameras end up in the trash bin and forgotten, discounted to oblivion, or end up collecting dust in a storage facilty. Not the LC1 or Digilux 2.<br /><br />There is a reason for that.<br /><br />No amount of reading will make you understand the draw of this camera. If you like to think when you photograph, if you like to practice photography fundamentals, if you like perfect manual controls, then this camera is probably going to make you very happy.<br /><br />It's as perfect of a design as designs can get, especially for the time it was introduced.<br /><br />Carl","I've had this camera for about two years. Having cut my photographic teeth on an old SLR, I am familiar with manually manipulating lenses, dials, and so forth. I've owned several digital cameras from various manufacturers, and I usually end up shooting in \"program\" mode because digging through all the menu choices to set up a shot often means that I've lost the shot.<br /><br />What a difference it is to work with this camera--a simple manual adjustment, made in a couple of seconds, is all it takes to do a set-up. The lens is larger and brighter than on most digital cameras, although the zoom range is a bit limited (a trade-off).  And 5 megapixels on this camera definitely gives you more picture than 5 megapixels on a pocketable camera -- the sensor is better, and I think the individual pixels are larger.  (Get a big memory chip as soon as you can--this camera's files seem to be about double the size of those on an ordinary camera.) Images are beautiful, and worthy of the Leica lens.<br /><br />One big minus I've found on this camera is the coarse, grainy viewfinder image--but on a digital camera you'll usually be composing on the screen.  (I like the view that's nicely gridded into thirds.) There's also considerable \"noise\" when shooting at 200 ISO. But with the larger lens aperture, I don't use that setting much.<br /><br />This is a classic--simple to use, great images. I'll be keeping it a long time.","So here's the scenario that led me to purchase this camera.  After  years of photography with a Contax RTS II system, I dropped photography almost completely for 10+ years.  The problem?  Enjoying the medium without the expense, overly complex process and lugging around 18 lbs of  equipment.  So I recently started to look at digital photography  to completely replace my film equipment.  I didn't want an SLR because a)while $1200 buy's a 20oz. technological marvel, it's still made like a disposable $100 EOS Rebel and b)I would be back in the trap of buying lenses and overcomplicating the process.  I wanted to get back to simple pure photography withough relying on fancy equipment.<br /><br />Here was the problem though.  There are virtually no non-slr digicams that offer full manual controls in a user friendly, old style manor.  Even the SLR's all rely on LCD displays, cheesey dials and buttons.<br /><br />There was only one (two including the Leica branded version)  camera made that offers a rugged classic rangefinder design, an APERATURE RING!, a SHUTTER DIAL!, and manual FOCUS! and ZOOM! rings.  While some of these are only emulate mechanical linkages, the end result is a camera that feels exactly like a Leica \"m\" or other traditional camera would.  Oh and by the way did I mention it comes with a fantastic bright Leica f 2.0 lens?<br /><br />In all honesty, I am not embarrassed to say that it boiled down to style and build quality.  Sure there are histograms, program shifts, multiple spot and zone metering/focusing options, a bounce flash (neat feature), 30fps video mode, RAW image format, etc. etc. etc. blah blah blah. All $1000+ digicams have lot's of features, and franklly they are all capable of fantastic images. In the end if you want a camera that is SIMPLY designed the way cameras were made 20-50 years ago with all the bells and whistles if you want them, this is the ONLY choice.<br /><br />Are there problems?  Sure... The low light focusing capabilities leave something to be desired as with most EVF cameras. There is no RAW buffer so RAW images take a few seconds to store. But my initial feeling for this camera is that it is a joy to use.<br /><br />This is not a cheap camera!  With a list of $1599 and a street of $1099-$1399, it will be hard for some to justify not getting a Nikon D70 and 2 lenses in order to get this instead.  It will be a certain type of buyer (you know who you are) that will buy this camera regardless of what I write.  If you are a poser, buy the Leica Digilux 2 for $1850 street price and throw away $750.  It is identical but the body on the Panasonic has a beautiful rubberized surface with just enough of a grip at the right to be effective.  The black finish is very nice as well.  It does however come with a few extras that would easily add $100+ to most DSLR's like an electronic cable release, a lense shade and filter.<br /><br />So in the end I got exactly what I wanted and if you are like me, you will not be dissapointed.","A friend had one of these at a camera event in Amsterdam. He took my SD card and put it in his camera and took a few pictures, then gave the SD card for me to put back in my Optio S4. I then took the same pictures with my camera. The difference in the quality of the photographs was absolutely astounding! The Leitz Summicron lens gives stunning quality. The camera also had a fold up shade for the large LCD on the back (don't know if this is an accessory or standard) like the old Speed Graphic cameras had for their ground glass--so you can see it in bright light. I have never seen a digital camera that produced such a high quality image, and the fit and finish is worthy of the Leitz lens.","I had been searching for this camera for a month.  I was frustrated because the best price online vendors were always out of stock.  Then I saw Amazons price and ordered it on a Sunday afternoon.  I paid for regular ground shipping thinking I could wait a few more days.  The camera was delivered Wednesday afternoon by FedEx.  The affiliated vendor, KB camera sent the camera expedited shipping even though I only paid for regular shipping.

It can produce, one after the other, the most beautiful images. I use it often for still objects, indoors, under natural light. Straight out of the camera, the images have a unique look, often needing little or no post-processing at all. I have had stunning results just shooting on a tripod, on fully automatic. Landscapes, portraits, street work are all areas in which the LC1 also delivers.<br />I've owned both the Digilux 2 and this. I sold the former because the LC1 is more personal to me and, at that time, was in pristine condition: I like the all-black finish better; the slightly rubberised areas make it far less slippery to hold than the D2. It is retro, without being a relic. The whole machine is of excellent build quality. It feels solid and tough. Everything slots, turns and clicks perfectly.<br /><br />The lens.<br /><br />Leica Vario - Summicron, 28mm-90mm.<br />f2 - f2.4.<br /><br />I don't know how many, if any, 28-90mm zooms are as fast as this, never mind Leica ones. It is spectacular, the heart of the camera.<br /><br />Allow for its shortcomings, which are only relative to much newer cameras. It may be old but it's not humbled by any other camera. This is a superb image-making instrument.<br /><br />I have to agree with the statement that Panasonic and Leica were way ahead of their time with the LC1. It is a classic.","I've written extensively on this camera and the digilux 2 online on my own blog.<br /><br />This camera and the digilux 2 are considered true classic cameras, and a decade later they still do not dissapoint the discerning photographer who embraces the foundation of principles and fundamentals that make photography a rewarding experience.<br /><br />This camera design is truly unique- one of a kind. Dismissed by the masses but embraced by a very niche group of photographers that desire a camera to be both a design first priority, and, a work of art- at the very same time.<br /><br />The lens of this camera, its manual controls, its bright aperture, internal zoom, build quality, and ultimately its excellent performance- are the heart of its lure and soul of its operation. The body style, and external controls compliment this lens design perfectly. Its size is both large enough to operate manually without being cramped, and small enough to be carried anywhere all day long without fatigue in any way.<br /><br />It's sensor is excellent still to this day, 5mp actually translates to the resolution output of many 10mp sensors because of how sharp this lens is. So don't be swayed by that specification. While this camera's operational speed is pedestrian compared to many of today's cameras, its that exact quality which endears it to owners of it. The mere fact that this camera in some ways is inadequate (compared to faster DSLRS) to a variety of shooting circumstances forces the photographer to think his/her way through the process. Thus a shot well done grants the photographer a proud achievement.<br /><br />This is in stark contrast to using a DSLR where shooting a burst of images with a blazing fast autofocus and burst rate yeild one good image out of many.<br /><br />It's EVF and LCD are adequate, and with some practice can become intuitive to the shooters needs. The short range of ISO (compared to today's cameras) is also adequate considering the lens fast aperture, and the fact that it yields sharp images wide open. When you do the math you'll see that a comparable DSLR kit would need to use an ISO speed two stops or more higher than this camera to get the same shutter speed.<br /><br />The build quality of this camera, its handling, are first rate. Leica spearheaded its design (both cameras) and Panasonic provided the production capability and electronics. Don't be fooled into believing that this is a Panasonic design first and foremost. Its actually the other way around.<br /><br />This camera and its twin, continue to hold value extremely well. Most digital cameras end up in the trash bin and forgotten, discounted to oblivion, or end up collecting dust in a storage facilty. Not the LC1 or Digilux 2.<br /><br />There is a reason for that.<br /><br />No amount of reading will make you understand the draw of this camera. If you like to think when you photograph, if you like to practice photography fundamentals, if you like perfect manual controls, then this camera is probably going to make you very happy.<br /><br />It's as perfect of a design as designs can get, especially for the time it was introduced.<br /><br />Carl","I've had this camera for about two years. Having cut my photographic teeth on an old SLR, I am familiar with manually manipulating lenses, dials, and so forth. I've owned several digital cameras from various manufacturers, and I usually end up shooting in \"program\" mode because digging through all the menu choices to set up a shot often means that I've lost the shot.<br /><br />What a difference it is to work with this camera--a simple manual adjustment, made in a couple of seconds, is all it takes to do a set-up. The lens is larger and brighter than on most digital cameras, although the zoom range is a bit limited (a trade-off).  And 5 megapixels on this camera definitely gives you more picture than 5 megapixels on a pocketable camera -- the sensor is better, and I think the individual pixels are larger.  (Get a big memory chip as soon as you can--this camera's files seem to be about double the size of those on an ordinary camera.) Images are beautiful, and worthy of the Leica lens.<br /><br />One big minus I've found on this camera is the coarse, grainy viewfinder image--but on a digital camera you'll usually be composing on the screen.  (I like the view that's nicely gridded into thirds.) There's also considerable \"noise\" when shooting at 200 ISO. But with the larger lens aperture, I don't use that setting much.<br /><br />This is a classic--simple to use, great images. I'll be keeping it a long time.","So here's the scenario that led me to purchase this camera.  After  years of photography with a Contax RTS II system, I dropped photography almost completely for 10+ years.  The problem?  Enjoying the medium without the expense, overly complex process and lugging around 18 lbs of  equipment.  So I recently started to look at digital photography  to completely replace my film equipment.  I didn't want an SLR because a)while $1200 buy's a 20oz. technological marvel, it's still made like a disposable $100 EOS Rebel and b)I would be back in the trap of buying lenses and overcomplicating the process.  I wanted to get back to simple pure photography withough relying on fancy equipment.<br /><br />Here was the problem though.  There are virtually no non-slr digicams that offer full manual controls in a user friendly, old style manor.  Even the SLR's all rely on LCD displays, cheesey dials and buttons.<br /><br />There was only one (two including the Leica branded version)  camera made that offers a rugged classic rangefinder design, an APERATURE RING!, a SHUTTER DIAL!, and manual FOCUS! and ZOOM! rings.  While some of these are only emulate mechanical linkages, the end result is a camera that feels exactly like a Leica \"m\" or other traditional camera would.  Oh and by the way did I mention it comes with a fantastic bright Leica f 2.0 lens?<br /><br />In all honesty, I am not embarrassed to say that it boiled down to style and build quality.  Sure there are histograms, program shifts, multiple spot and zone metering/focusing options, a bounce flash (neat feature), 30fps video mode, RAW image format, etc. etc. etc. blah blah blah. All $1000+ digicams have lot's of features, and franklly they are all capable of fantastic images. In the end if you want a camera that is SIMPLY designed the way cameras were made 20-50 years ago with all the bells and whistles if you want them, this is the ONLY choice.<br /><br />Are there problems?  Sure... The low light focusing capabilities leave something to be desired as with most EVF cameras. There is no RAW buffer so RAW images take a few seconds to store. But my initial feeling for this camera is that it is a joy to use.<br /><br />This is not a cheap camera!  With a list of $1599 and a street of $1099-$1399, it will be hard for some to justify not getting a Nikon D70 and 2 lenses in order to get this instead.  It will be a certain type of buyer (you know who you are) that will buy this camera regardless of what I write.  If you are a poser, buy the Leica Digilux 2 for $1850 street price and throw away $750.  It is identical but the body on the Panasonic has a beautiful rubberized surface with just enough of a grip at the right to be effective.  The black finish is very nice as well.  It does however come with a few extras that would easily add $100+ to most DSLR's like an electronic cable release, a lense shade and filter.<br /><br />So in the end I got exactly what I wanted and if you are like me, you will not be dissapointed.","A friend had one of these at a camera event in Amsterdam. He took my SD card and put it in his camera and took a few pictures, then gave the SD card for me to put back in my Optio S4. I then took the same pictures with my camera. The difference in the quality of the photographs was absolutely astounding! The Leitz Summicron lens gives stunning quality. The camera also had a fold up shade for the large LCD on the back (don't know if this is an accessory or standard) like the old Speed Graphic cameras had for their ground glass--so you can see it in bright light. I have never seen a digital camera that produced such a high quality image, and the fit and finish is worthy of the Leitz lens.","I had been searching for this camera for a month.  I was frustrated because the best price online vendors were always out of stock.  Then I saw Amazons price and ordered it on a Sunday afternoon.  I paid for regular ground shipping thinking I could wait a few more days.  The camera was delivered Wednesday afternoon by FedEx.  The affiliated vendor, KB camera sent the camera expedited shipping even though I only paid for regular shipping.  What a great surprise.<br />The camera is everything I thought it would be-great fit and finish, all the accessories promised and that wonderful Leica lens.  Kudos to Amazon and KB Camera for service that exceeded my expectations."]},{"name":"HP Photosmart R707","amazon_reviews":["Thank you very much! I really love this camera.

It has a variety of features including action and night vision and you can even further configure the shutter speed manually (through ISO or something like that).<br /><br />You do not have to worry about lifting a flap for a flash or taking a cap off for the lens.

My wife wanted a simple, small camera, that would be user friendly and take good pictures, so I bought her a Konica/Minolta \"XG\" and I was very impressed with the improvements made since I had owned my original X model. If you want a camera that is primarily for exchanging pictures on the Internet, or for prints that are smaller then 8x10 this camera is great. The huge advantage it has is it's slim, small design, while still having an excellent, non protuding, telephoto built in, along with extremely fast start up and excellent picture quality. All in all, one of the best small digital cameras that were ever made and holds its own up against the newest brands.","The Konica Minolta Xg received an outstanding review in the Wall Street Journal, which motivated me to buy it as my first digital camera. I recently bought a second Xg after my first one was fried when I went swimming with it in my pocket.  The range/view finder, which has been eliminated from most pocket cameras, allows you to see a close approximation of the picture without relying on the LCD screen.  The LCD is small by today's standards but more than adequate to check the image and show others.  Taking pictures using the LCD screen is practically impossible outdoors in bright light, even with the large screens now available.  The viewfinder allows you to hold the camera in the traditional in-your-face picture taking position where it is stable and less likely to move and result in a fuzzy image, which can easily happen holding the camera at arms length viewing the LCD screen.  I also like the non-projecting lens design, which is protected by a sliding metal panel, because it maintains the shape of the camera.  The camera takes excellent pictures in my experience, with multiple pixel settings.  My only major problem was: the flash failed and required a $100 repair.  I never regretted making that investment.","I had this camera for a year now, and I've been very pleased. The main reason I bought this camera is the size. It fits in my pocket nicely. I love the features: night, portrait, action, etc..<br /><br />The flash is a little weak at night, and you probably need to use a tripod to get good pictures at night.<br /><br />I have had SOnys before, seen pictures from a Fuji and Cannon. I have to be honest, this is a 3.2 MP, the quality is below a 5 MP Sony or Cannon, or even a 3.2MP Sony. But it's hard to give up this little camera because of the convenience. I'll probably keep this when I do get a second.","I've had this camera for about 9 months.  It proves to be a usefull camera, with the basic features you need and takes nice pictures in proper lighting.  The flash could be better, but it is what you could expect for a camera this size.  Battery life is very good.  I bought 2 extras, but hardly ever need them.  My son used it on a trip to Spain and came back with some very nice shots!","This was my first digicam and I bought it in quite a hurry. Here's what I like about this camera:1)very sleek and compact 2)zoom lens stays inside at all times 3)great outdoor and daytime shots. Here's what I dont like about my camera: 1)LCD resolution really bad 2)lag between 2 shots is too long and the worse part is that 3)this pretty thing is downright useless when it comes to night-time shots. In my opinion, this camera is like a beautiful woman on your arm.....great to flaunt; but when it comes to crunch time, you wish you had someone with more substance!","I've had this camera for about 9 month now and must say that I'm pretty happy with it. The battery capacity is great, as is the size. Picture quality is what I would consider pretty good and the features are all very useful. Particularly the ability to use it as a webcam is handy. Overall a great camera which I'd recommend in a heart-beat!","I have a Nikon 990 digital camera for work and personal projects. My wife wanted a digital camera to replace her Olympus Stylus.

I played with a friends Xt for a week and I agree, this XG felt like a downgrade instead of an upgrade.<br /><br />A totally different look in our photos. We turn the flash on for all photos, inside our outside on subjects and it makes a huge difference. After adjusting the camera f and shutter settings for your lighting and personal style the shots are still dark. Any more adjustments will make the shots blurry or washed out.<br /><br />We get photos from ofoto and they come out okay. Not as good as the Nikon 990 or film rolls we send in but good scenery shots. Startup is fast, I can whip the camera out of the pocket my family always wants the photos I take because it can capture the moment faster than anyone else with their gadgets. Shot to shot lags more than I expected.<br /><br />That is important to me - capturing the moment. Two buttons, no knobs or fiddling, just boom, boom, shoot. I wish the shots did not have as many artifacts in lowerlight and skintones. Overall, a good camera for someone who has kids or needs a second camera for the moments that you might miss because you did not have a camera on you.<br /><br />If you get this camera, watch your finger or thumb over the lens. Also, do not depend on centering a shot in the LCD display. It is way off from the actual lens.","I have had one of these cameras for about 2 weeks now. This is basically a fancy point and shoot camera. I am finding I am taking this little camera along everywhere because it is small and fun. I am taking it with me to places where I would never take a camera before.<br /><br />I love the small size of this camera, and that it is super-easy to adjust the exposure up to + or - 2.0 EVs. (I have not found any way to specifically override shutter speed or f-stop; but there is a program which places the camera in shutter-speed preferred mode.) With its very small size, I found that my finger at first tended to get in front of the lens, which is at the top corner of the camera where the viewfinder window would ordinarily be. (The viewfinder is immediately adjacent, inboard from the lens, where the rangefinder window would ordinarily be.) The battery life is excellent. The autofocus works fine. Once focus is set, the shutter lag is minimal. There is spot autofocus and spot exposure metering available (requires scrolling through menus.) Sharpness is good for a point and shoot -- I am not expecting the same performance that I get from the high-end optics I attach to my Contax bodies. Distortion from the lens is less at all focal lengths than I expected, and contrast is reasonbly good. All-in-all, so far I am very happy with this little guy and heartily recommend it.","I bought one of the first Minolta \"X\" versions of this years ago and owned it with heavy use for about 4 years.

Like most people, I am only a casual photographer who wants to cature a few visual memories.  I wouldn't even take with me a larger -sized camera, so those memories are lost.  Because of this camera's small size, I take it with me quite a bit, so I am able to capture moments on \"film\" even if they aren't suitable for poster-sized framing.  Still, the photos are very sharp and nicely colored for 5x7 prints, or even 8x10 if there isn't a lot of detail in the shot.  Who prints 8x10s anyway?  5x7 or even smaller is all most people need.  The price was fantastic, too.  Small cameras like this aren't usually 3.2 MP, so that is a plus.  I also really like the full-motion movie taking capabilities, WITH SOUND, too.  This is very cool and affordable technology in a small, sleek  form that will actually get used!","Here is a little history of my digital camera use.  I started using dig cameras when a 640 x 480 camera was $350.  Now they practically give away these cameras away in cereal boxes.  Since then I've used fuji mx2900, fuji mx4900, coolpix 990, SLR-type Minolta N-10, and minolta N-20.  Now I have a the Mionolta Xg and I must say it is the easiest to use out of all the cameras I've tested. Usually the battery life is inaccurate.  On many cameras, after 50-60 pictures and the battery is dead.  I went to korea, and I took over 160 pictures on one battery!  Thus, I bought an extra battery for no reason.  The size is incredible, and the start up time is the best.  It is quite frustrating when you want to capture something and you have to wait for your camera to start up.  This camera starts in a mere 0.8 seconds.<br /><br />Additionally, the camera has a fairly sturdy casing and automatic lens cover.  finally, the LCD is one of the best I've used in overly bright light conditions.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />One con is the iso only goes upto 400.  This makes night shots difficult.  Plus since it is hard to control the white balance, you may need to adjust some of your night shots on the computer.  Additionally, there is distortion around the corners of the pictures.  It is a trade of for the internal zoom lens system.  This also causes slight vignetting, which is most obvious when taking pictures of a clear blue horizon.  If you want to take perfect pictures and have complete control then buy an SLR film camera.  If you want a light weight easy to use camera that can go anywhere, then buy a digital like the Dimage Xg.","This is the camera for people who'd want to unload the burden while travel.  This is my first digital camera.  I was attracted by its compact size, so I bought it and took it with me to China.<br /><br />Am I glad I made the right choice.  With its compact size, it fits in any of my packet so that I can take picture whenever and wherever.  The quality is better than any fool-proof camera, and with my recently bought LCD Photo Frame, I can enjoy and share my good memory with my friends and family all the time!  The only problem is that the flash seems to consume lots of power so remember to buy extra battery.","I read all the reviews and got this great form factor camera, however it does not shoot as fast as the Sony T1 (my other choice) from shot to shot, but the startup is as fast or faster. The low light performance is better than the T1 and causes less red eye. It also has the optical as well as the lcd viewfinder. 10x zoom in a non-prutruding lens design is great. BATTERY LIFE IS PHENOMENAL! Secure Digital Card (SD)fits right into your Palm or Pocket PC. Overall a great little camera that you can take anywhere and forget you are carrying it.<br /><br />It all boils down to your memory. If you are using Sony Memory stick, stay with all Sony hardware. Otherwise SD is a great choice as you can have your choice of Palm, Pocket PC, Canon and other hardware that uses the SD format.<br /><br />This has been a great little camera. Highly recommended!","First off, I have owned a few digital cameras.  The first was a Sony dsc-p92, nice camera, great quality pictures, a little bulky for the pocket. Traded this camera for the Olympus c-750uz, which is a fabulous camera and has everything one would want in a camera except size.  This camera was stolen because instead of putting it in my pocket(can't do way to big) after the battery went dead, I stupidly put it back in my car in sight (I always put the camera in the trunk except this day) while at the Lowry Park zoo in Tampa for what was to be a few minutes while walking around the park outside. Anyway some Lowlifes broke out he window and grabbed the camera.  (We were told by the park security they had been doing this a lot, Thanks for the warning after $700 worth of camera gone).  The dilemma for the next camera was primarily wanting a camera that I didn't mind having in my pocket even after the batteries went dead, and one my girfriend didn't mind carrying(she hated both the other cameras for their bulkiness).  We also wanted a camera that took decent pictures.  Did lots of internet research and came across the Xt,  I read reviews for the Xt and loved everything about it, except that some reviewers had complained about picture quality, so it was out.  Later while going to Ritz camera they had an Xg, and was told about a wall street journal article that raved about it picture quality being even better than the new Sony 5mp mini.  Decided to get the Xg and test it out.  Wow, Minolta must have fixed any problems with the previous model, this takes a great picture for 3.2mp. It is not up to the definition of the Olympus or sony, and I do miss the 10x zoom sometimes, but this camera goes everywhere.  It is so fast to start up, advertised as the quickest, and It focuses very fast.  My other cameras were a lot slower.  Was out last night at a club, and got some great pictures of the band, the flash is very bright.  I also experimented with the movie and recorded one of the songs.  Now this place was dark, so the movie pictures were not the best, but the sound quality was amazing! If you want a great audio recorder this is it.  The movies taken in full light are ok, but you wouldn't want this camera to be your movie camera nevertheless, cool movies as long as the memory card can handle(The memory cards are very small and cheaper than comparable Sony and Olympus).  Also just started using the burst mode for pictures, If you want some good pictures of your friends this camera can snap off (very quickly)as many pictures as you need, so you can go back and keep the one where everyone has the best smile.  Why try for the one perfect picture? I get about six real quick and always have at least one really good picture.  Other nice features are the battery life, very long outlasts 256mb of pictures.  At first I wanted a camera that took AA batterys, already have rechargeables, but I love this Li-ion battrery, very lightweight and small, and can get them for about $10 on the internet, not bad, and they don't have be drained completely like the Ni-Mh.  They charge really fast too. An Hour Maybe.  SO how about the complaints?  A little weird to handle at first because of the lens and Lcd location. Finger gets in front of lens until trained :) LCD worthless in sunlight, but didn't expect it to be. If Minolta could put the lcd into the viewfinder and have an eyecup attached that kept out the light, that would be fantastic. And if they could ever get a 10x zoom and 5mp in a camera so small, WOW. Your camera purchase comes down to what do need the most.  I think the Olympus has the most features, 10x zoom is amazing plus they sell 2x multipliers for 20X!! and best picture, has raw file mode for uncompressed files.  This camera is great for wildlife photography.  The only drawback is the size, but still not a big a some digitals or 35mm.  The Minolta gives up a few things but much less than any other camera I saw that was as portable or in the price range.  The problems I read others had with this camera I did not find.  Someone had a focusing problem indoors, I did not,  without flash they will blur sometimes which is to be expected (use a mini tripod).  I have taken pictures at night without the flash(and a solid platform) to get the background and they come out brighter than my eyes can see, very surprised.  Other people complained about not having a battery cradle and AV output, but you get so many other things other cameras dont have and the easiest portability of almost any other camera, so this was not a problem for me, it all comes down to what you want, and they haven't made a Camera that has everything in one package yet.....getting close though :)","Love the small size and fast startup time, as well as the ability to manipulate manual controls if you want. A couple of things that I miss from my previous Canon Digital Elph: 1- there is no TV (RCA connector) hookup. This is a really nice feature so you can come home and quickly do a slide show on the TV. 2- the charger cable is almost as big as the charger. Again, Canon did it right; the slightly larger charger has prongs built right in, no cord to tie up or tangle.<br />Otherwise, nice small, feature-packed package with 3mp capability.","This camera is essentially the same as Xt, except that it has lost some features:<br />-no more charging stand! It's not even available as an option, since the charger contacts were removed all together. you will have to take your batteries out to charge, which is one of the design flaws on other ultralight cameras that drove me to Minolta's original design. Furthermore, the battery charger is just a slight variation of the original charging stand (which charged both camera and batteries), thus it is unnecessarily bulky (with wires galore) for its now reduced functionality.<br />-no more a/c adaptor port. to use the camera with a/c, you will have to buy a proprietary battery-replacing adaptor (a dummy battery with wires).. i.e. you'll have to take the battery out and replace it with the adaptor for it to work, and the wire coming out of a little sliding door next to the battery bay. the door becomes an extrangeous loose piece most of the time, for most people.<br />-lower resolution LCD monitor (85k vs 110k) but slightly larger (1.6\" vs. 1.5\").<br />-No more TIFF (uncompressed) format.<br />-No more video out (where you can play back pictures on TV).<br />-No more quick switching option between color modes through left-right toggles.<br />It has gained a few things:<br />-programmed AE modes: it adds nothing to its photographic features. There's nothing that the camera couldn't do already with orignal set of controls, though some may find it easier to use.<br />-New Image Processor that reportedly improves color.<br />-Better battery life (resulting from the new processor. The camera as well as the Xt uses almost no current with LCD off: extremely efficient).<br />-Added 30fps movie mode (Xt has 15fps only) as well as night mode for movies.<br />-Some seemingly useless features: a paste-over feature where you can superimpose your pictures against some cartoon background; 9-in-1 picture mode, etc.<br /><br />-Allows in-camera movie edit and picture cropping.<br />-it's priced higher.<br />I mourn the demise of a great little combination. Xg feels almost like a downgrade rather than an upgrade. Seeing Xt's corners being cut off and its price jacked up worries me with the direction which Minolta is moving. Xt's a wonderful camera, and so is this nearly-identical Xg, especially now (supposedly) with better images and longer battery life. Yet it seems to me Xt's execution was done with more heart and less number crunching.<br />my $.02","I wanted a camera that was small and light, to use when backpacking. This little camera represents an excellent compromise for my needs. I like the fact that it is compact; I carry it in my pocket all the time, unlike my other digital camera that gets left behind much of the time. I like the fact that the lens extension is completely internal, and that the camera does not change shape or get larger when opened for shooting. The internal lens means the camera is ready to take pictures in less than a second from turning it on.<br />One needs to be sure to hold the camera carefully when shooting, since the light weight makes it easy to take shaky pictures. Also, one needs to hold it as recommended to avoid blocking part of the picture with a finger or thumb. I can deal with these caveats.<br />All in all, I'm highly satisfied with this camera as meeting my specific needs. I recommend it for anyone needing a camera that's small, light, and always at the ready for a picture. This is one camera that you will take along with you.<br />Jay","All:<br />I have had this camera for a week and really like it.<br />PROS: Everything the ads say are true. Great pics.<br />Fast startup and snap. Great for people who dont want<br />to mess with lot of manual settings, although you can do<br />that too.<br />CONS: Have to think hard for these, but the lens is in a spot that you have to be careful not to cover with your finger when snapping a pic. Also, dont buy the Minolta camera case that you can get to fit the camera. It is a poorly designed case.","All:<br />I have had this camera for a week and really like it.<br />PROS: Everything the ads say are true. Great pics.<br />  Fast startup and snap.

This is probably the biggest loss for the XG.<br />Summary:<br />The ultra slim Minolta DiMAGE Xg packs a 3x optical zoom and 3.2-megapixel resolution into a body that is just 20mm thick! Though the DiMAGE Xg is almost identical to its predecessor, the DiMAGE Xt, it has a number of fundamental difference, including a faster start-up time (a speedy 0.8 seconds), a larger 1.6\" LCD monitor, and a fast, 30-frame-per-second movie mode for high quality movies. Much longer battery life - 240 minute playback versus 120 for the XT. Specific AE program modes for sports, portraits, landscapes, sunsets, night scenes. Sports means faster shutter to catch action and so on. Multi-frame in one frame capture for action sequences (9 pics in less than three seconds). Manual settings mode somewhat like the Canon S230. One switch setting chooses the auto settings including the 5 AE modes. The other lets you choose color mode, ISO sensitivity, metering, and white balance. PictBridge printing support. In camera picture editing functions such as cropping and reframing pictures. In camera cut/paste function allows you to place an image within another image. This is one fantastic camera!","This camera rivals the quality of picture with my Canon G3.  It doesn't have as many possible settings, but sometimes that's a real convenience.  Quick to start up, fast saving of pictures, and great quality, color, and clarity.  Plus it doesn't hurt that my laptop has an SD drive so it's easy to download the pictures instead of hooking up the adapter for Compact Flash.  Lightweight, easy to use, great pictures at a very very low price.  A winner in my opinion.","By far the best ultra compact, truly shirt pocket digital camera with the right combination of features.  Not the best in the world, but real close.  The start up time is less than a second and your ready to shoot.  One mode for fully automatic with preprogrammed settings for portait, sport, sunset, night, and landscape.  Another mode to have more granular control of sensitivity, white balance, and exposure.<br />Prints great 4x6 pictures on glossy paper, which is 99.9% of the type of pictures I will print.  Comes with a 16MB SD card allowing continuous shooting at 1.5 frames per second.<br />There is a 3x optical zoom that is non-protruding.  Great technology with great pictures.  I haven't taken a camera on trips due to their bulkiness.  Yes, I'm lazy.  The Xg is easily kept in a shirt pocket readily available when the urge strikes.","I like many other people, first became interested in this camera because of the WSJ article.<br />Its tiny, has intuitive useful features such as 6 different types of photo settings, the ability to turn on and be ready to take a shot in less than a second, and it can do digital video with sound.  It takes great pictures at 3.2 MP (which is all i, and most users really need.) COmbine all this that with the fact that it doesn' have a protruding lens and you have one great camera.  At $299, it really is an inexpensive alternative in this latest wave of \"compact digitals\"<br />I would have given it five starts but the battery must be removed to charge it, which really isn't that big of a deal, but a cradle feature would have been a nice touch.  Also, if you use the viewfinder to take pictures (which i do, call me conservative,) the placement of the lens and the camera's extremely small size makes it very likely your finger is going to be in the shot.  The camera is definately geared towards people who want to snap photos using the LCD screen exclusively.<br />I got no beef with this camera.  It rocks, get one!","I'd been looking for a pocketable digital camera for quite some time and finally settled on the Dimage Xg (after trying and returning several others).  For what you get it's a bit on the pricey side, but it can take great-looking images.  It is a nice size with easy-to-use menus and controls.  The zoom is much quieter than my Nikon Coolpix 995 and image quality is about the same, maybe even slightly better.  However, the Xg does have serious issues with focus, esp. in dimly-lit areas or where the contrast difference is very high (for example, at first I could not get an accurate focus on my blank and white dog).  This can be rectified with careful composing and locking the focus.  Also I found switching to SPOT FOCUS works much, much better.  All in all, it's a nice camera I can easily drop into a pocket and have when I need it.","The Dimage Xg appears to be a mixed upgrade to the Xt.<br />The Xt featured a charger stand that allowed for the battery to be charged while in the camera.  Contrary to what the Wall Street Journal article claimed, on the Xg, the battery must be removed and placed in the charger.  Ok, so not that big of a deal, but the charger is clunky with a thick external cord.  For that much infrastructure it should be a charger stand like it was on the Xt. Or, on a camera where removing the battery to charge is a must, the charger should be compact with a flip out plug like that of the Canon Elph series.  The Xg charger is the worst of both worlds.<br />The Xg also lacks the TIFF file format setting and the A/V outputs of the Xt.<br />There are some nice new features such as the Automatic Digital Subject Program Selection, but that appears to only work if one does not use the zoom.  I suppose that if you have time to zoom you have time to select the proper Subject mode but that seems like an omission that could have easily been included.<br />The best feature that the Xg has over the Xt is a drive mode where the camera takes 9 pictures in rapid succession and then produces a grid image with all 9 in one frame (albeit at lower resolutions for each discreet image).<br />Overall it appears to be a mixed upgrade to the Xt.  The gains are offset by some loss of convenience.  If the Digital Subject Programs actually help it take better pictures then it will probably be worth it.  More time with the camera will tell if the additional features are a worthwhile trade off for the loss of the charger stand.","If you are looking for a digital camera that will slip right in your pocket and takes terrific pictures, this is the camera. The Dimage XG is so small and thin you will be in shock when you see it in person. The amazing thing is that it takes 3.2 mega-pixel pictures AND includes a 3x optical zoom lens (that is built INSIDE the body of the camera). I bought a 256 MB card which lets me take over 150 \"high quality\" photos (that's a lot of rolls of film). I also ordered the marine enclosure, which I'm looking forward to using while snorkeling in Maui. The color accuracy and photo clarity are both impressive.<br />This camera replaced my \"chunky\" Olympus Camedia D-40 ZOOM. It was a pain to put in your pocket (1-3/4 inches thick), and the menu system was horribly unintuitive.<br />I didn't have the \"white stripe\" problem that another poster mentioned. Maybe their camera was defective.","After looking for a small digital camera for family gatherings, vacations, and general candid photo ops, I came across a review in the Wall Street Journal dated 2/18 rating four new small digital cameras hitting the market in the next few months.  I was amazed that they picked a Konica Minolta over the others, including the new Sony DSC-T1, which retails for $549.00.<br />I've had the camera for a few days and it so user friendly that my wife is no longer intimidated by digital photography.  It is incredibly small yet I had no trouble holding it comfortably and was able to keep still while shooting.<br />I have a Nikon Coolpix 950 which I doubt I'll use again.<br />Also, don't be misled by megapixels: 3.2 is plenty for printing, even 8x10\" photos.  Look for more pixels only if you will be  cropping large sections of the photo and then printing large copies.  The only down side is the 16MB SD card provided.  On the 'fine' setting, only 9 photos fit on the card.  Order at least a 256MB which holds approx. 154 photos.<br />Last, but certainly not least, is photo quality.  It is as good or better than larger, more expensive digital cameras I've used.  Red-eye reduction deserves special mention as working well.  Overall, a great package at an unbeatable price."]},{"name":"Konica Minolta DiMAGE Z2","amazon_reviews":["great","Camera had absolutely no paperwork with it.

The super macro is better than any camera I've seen<br />in its class and better than some more expensive cameras. These cameras are going real cheap now that they aren't being made<br />anymore and I'd highly recommend one especially if you like macro photography.","This is my second camera of this model.  The first purchase was around 10 years ago and I purchased the camera to take on my safari trip to East Africa.  The camera took such wonderful photographs and the zoom properties were so good that many asked me if I was a professional.  After a while, I decided that I needed to replace the older camera and I did but selected a gently used version of the same camera.  I am totally pleased with my purchase.","First the bad points<br />well there's just one-in gloomy conditions, or indoors without enough light it won't lock onto anything and you'll be out of focus. I'm sure they could easily have sorted this at Konolta but they didn't<br />BAD boys<br />Other than that it's great.<br />Oh the other minus-the battery compartment broke a lug so it doesn't close flush-you can see the lugs are far too small.<br />Oh and it has a hot shoe for a flash, but generic ones won't fit and it'll have to be a Minika one, or buy an adapter from Ebay<br />However...........this is a great camera. Lovely images (I'm sure they aren't as good as a DSLR but you'd never know, and neither will most people) and despite the initial reviews suggesting fragility...? Well mine has been totally immersed in a slurry pond. I fell into it carrying the camera. Don't ask how this happened.<br />It was full of water, sheep poo and dead fish. I assumed it was dead.<br />Dried it out over a couple of weeks. It's still working. The focus is a bit creaky now, but it's probably got frog spawn in it.<br />Top Marks Minnikaka.<br />Well, apart from the low light focus issue.....<br /><br />3 July 2012<br />Dropped the camera on a stone floor. The lens fell apart, outer lens element, locking ring and another bit ;) fell out and rolled over the floor.<br />24 hours later (and soberer) picked up the bits, reassambled and bingo.<br />This has to be The Terminator of the camera world.","I love this camera.  We've had this camera for years and still very happy with it.  It takes gorgeous pictures.  I like to do a lot of scenery and outdoor photography (amateur), and this camera has captured beautiful colors.  It's also not big and bulky.  As far as pictures in dim lighting, I took a shot of my son with his father after turkey hunting one day.  It was getting dusk, and the background was dark, but the picture turned out beautiful with this camera, one of my favorites.  I wish I could put it on here so you could see it.  Anyway, GREAT camera and has lasted many years with much use (I can't even remember when I bought it it's been so long).  We're taking it with us on our wedding anniversary trip to Hawaii in April.  I'm confident it will capture every moment beautifully!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I did add a couple photos, including the one of my son and his father, to the gallery. :)","I used this camera from 2004 to 2009, when I dropped it once too often. It took beautiful pictures, was easy to use, and served me very well.  Now I'm trying to replace it, and I wish there was a more up-to-date version available.","Konica Minolta Dimage Z2 4MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical ZoomFor more bang for the buck I would choose my Dimage Z2 anytime. It's fast on focus and outdoor shots are the best.","I bought this camera in 2004 and have used it extensively.  I have taken it to Kamchatka, to Egypt, and many places in the US.  This camera is capable of taking amazing pictures, easily and consistently.  It works great, is easy to carry, and comfortable to use.  Four years later, it's still my favorite camera to use when I want that 'special shot'. I wish Konica Minolta was still in business!","I have had this camera for almost 5 years.  I have taken literally thousands of pictures with it and have never had a problem. I got it shortly after my son was born and have since used it to capture and freeze moments of his life.  I take pictures almost on a daily basis not only of my family but also of nature and pretty much anything else that looks interesting. By no means am I a professional but in my opinion for a 5 yr old 4mp camera it still takes the sharpest most vibrant pictures. My mom recently bought my dream camera for herself and after using her camera then going back to my little minolta I still prefer my minolta.","Pros:<br />* Uses AA batteries and can take nearly 250 pictures without a flash on newly charged batteries.<br />* Outstanding picture clarity outdoors.<br />* Incredible pictures at night when set on a tripod or flat surface and using the timer.  Can set shutter to stay open up to 15 seconds.  Only Z2 & Z3 allow that -- later models only allow about 5 seconds.<br />* 10x zoom is awesome, and takes great pictures outdoors even when hand held without antishake technology.<br />* Hot shoe for adding a flash.<br />* Extremely easy to use. My 7 y/o takes great pictures and movies with it, can download and adjust to sepia or b/w all by himself.<br />* Camera is full of features:  ISO 50-400, movies up to 800x600, night movie mode, auto or manual white balance, no special software or equipment needed to get pictures off camera, hook up to computer or tv for slideshow, 2 macro modes, multiple flash settings, burst mode, timer, sepia/b&w/vivid color/natural color modes, sharpnes & contrast controls, able to use additional lenses, etc.<br />* More rugged than it feels. It's our family camera -- used by little kids and adults. We've taken tens of thousands of pictures with it in all kinds of lighting and weather -- it's been dropped countless times -- and it still works faithfully taking great pictures.<br />* Uses SD cards.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* When adjusting the zoom while taking a movie you hear the camera motor on the sound of the movie.<br />* No anti-shake technology. Available in the Z3 and up.<br />* Taking pictures indoors, in normal low light is a challenge sometimes.<br /><br />I love this camera and am going to buy another Konica Minolta -- probably Z3.","This was our first experience with a digital camera!  I love the fact of the zoom feature and it is much more than a \"point and shoot\".  We did experience a problem with the view finder (the window just for one eye) not working for over a year!  We didn't take it to anyone to get fixed (the company didn't want it sent back) because it was bought with a gift card and we didn't have the money.  All of a sudden,it started working again--don't have any idea why!  Besides that my biggest complaint is that it is too bulky for everyday shooting or even vacation shooting.  If you want a camera for beautiful shots and want to take your time with it, get this.","I have this Camera for almost 3 years. This camera is excellent in daylight but miserably fails in low light. This is my first Digital Camera and I am happy with day light performance but I hate it for pictures taken inside home. Automode never works good. Try manually, setup the shutter speed and aperature it is near perfect.","Buy this camera with the accessory kit and a bigger memory card. We love ours. No problems.","Even after a year, I still love this camera. I had wanted a camcorder for recording the kids but a friend cautioned that expensive camcorders largely sit on shelves 99% of the time; a camera with video capabilities might be a better value for occasional video needs.<br /><br />My needs were very modest: 4-megapixel minimum, a decent zoom (optical of course) and the best video capabilities I could afford.  After reading reviews, I had initially settled on the Dimage Z3.  However, a timely online sale and much better (SVGA) video capabilities \"downgraded\" my order to the older Z2.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />- A GT 10x optical zoom - apparently this raised eyebrows when it came out<br /><br />- TV-quality movies with a good built-in microphone<br /><br />- Color LCD display and built-in speaker for instant video playback<br /><br />- Quick startup and shutdown - no waiting<br /><br />- Uses nonproprietary batteries (4 AA), so you don't have to buy an expensive 2nd battery or run back home or to the hotel to recharge, as I have done with my Canon Elph<br /><br />- Downloadable firmware updates from the Konica website<br /><br />- Largely automatic and idiot-proof<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />- Plastic casing - my Canon Elph is all-aluminum and is of clearly superior construction<br /><br />- Low light levels defeat an otherwise good auto-focus feature<br /><br />- The flash must be lifted manually - but this is good when you don't want the flash on and don't want to cycle through menus to turn it off<br /><br />- Way too many features for me to ever appreciate - I would categorize the Z2 as a near-professional camera. It's not specialized enough for pros but is way too complex for everyday consumer-grade use. Again, not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />You will want to buy larger capacity SD cards (my high-speed 512MB SD cards, even when recording video, hardly ever fill up) and an adapter ring if you use UV or other filters.  On this last note, be aware that when I bought my Z2, Amazon recommended a UV filter that was the wrong size, and I bought it without verifying the size myself. I was unable to prove that the mistake wasn't mine (I merely clicked their link and added it to my shopping cart) and I got stuck with the restocking fee.  Make sure you do your homework before buying accessories. I picked up a Tiffen 52mm UV filter at a great price - using another website.<br /><br />In a nutshell, save your money and ignore the hot new camera this year.  Unless you take a lot of low-light action shots, buy a Z2 before they're gone.  As I write this, this once-$500 camera is still selling for about $150 at various sites.  Even though the Z2 is not the newest Dimage model, it's perfect for 90% of my amateur photo and video needs.  The video and zoom features alone make it a safe and solid buy, even today.","This camera is overall good buy for the price, however, it feels like it is going to break apart in my hands. The body is very poorly constructed, made out of cheap plastic. The black grip from the picture looks as if it is rubber, but...no. It is cheap plastic like the rest of it. Too bad, with a little extra \"beef\" it could be a bargain.","I got it refurbished from ubid for only 179. It arrived in new condition, fully functional. for that funny price I could have maybe gotten a funny pocket camera. Although I must admit I considered getting the panasonic lz2 with the 6x zoom. They are both great buys but if you want something more advanced the this is the way to go.","I've owned the Konica Minolta Dimage Z2 for about a year and a half.  The selling point was the slr at a price I could afford.<br /><br />In the past I shot with a 35mm, and swore by them against digital.  This camera changed my tune.  The quality is there, and the manual features are great.  It can be a bit quirky to work the controls.<br /><br />What I didn't like, was the only accessory listed was the wide angle lens attachment.  I wanted to use filters.  I have a ton of Cokins.<br /><br />Much to my amazment and joy, there is an attachment tube that screws on and has a 52mm thread mount for filters.  The item costs about $25 and is a worthwhile investment.","This has to be the most \"out of the box\" camera I have ever owned.  I picked this camera up for dirt cheap and really wanted a Canon Digital Rebel for $600 more.  I had this camera taking stunning photo's in about 15 minutes.  If you need something for eBay auctions, or want to dabble in digital photography before a major purchase on a high end SLR, this is the one to go with.  I would reccomend a 512 SD card, since this comes with 16 MB only.  The best part of this camera, is the vivid colors on the LCD screen.  It gives you a precise image of your photo before you take the picture and you know exactally what you will see when you download at home.","I have had my Konica Minolta Dimage Z2 for a year. I have taken about 3000 pictures in varying conditions. I mostly use it to take pictures of people, in particular of my family. The optical zoom comes is very handy for that. It makes it possible to take pictures at a distance. The subjects are less likely to notice that you are taking a picture and as a result they look more natural and relaxed.<br /><br />My main reasons for buying this camera were:<br />* SLR-style camera,<br />* huge optical zoom range,<br />* adequate resolution (4 MP),<br />* rather fast start-up time and<br />* a reasonable price.<br /><br />The best things about this camera:<br />* Possible to attach an external flash (I am buying one right now)<br />* 10x optical zoom<br />* SLR-style camera with loads of settings for the \"nerd\"<br />* Easy to use with a capable automatic mode<br />* Uses ordinary AA batteries which are available everywhere<br /><br />The worst things about this camera:<br />* Because the flash is so close to the lens subjects get red-eyes and may get a \"washed-out\" look (but on the other hand this is true of any camera this size or smaller)<br />* Auto-focus works poorly in dark rooms<br />* In bright daylight the dynamic range might be insufficient so that parts of the image gets all white<br /><br />You should consider this camera or one of its successors (Z3 and Z5 in particular) if you:<br />* Want an SLR-style camera without the size and price of a real SLR camera<br />* Want a camera with a great optical zoom range","This was my first digital camera to own though I have tried out friend's cameras.<br /><br />* I found it very simple to start using.<br /><br />* Camera's image stabilizing time is real fast comparing to similar zooms in other cameras.<br /><br />* Quality of pictures taken is excellent.<br /><br />Only thing I noticed on the camera is that the battery close door is too flimsy and delicate.<br /><br />My Suggestion would be to order a Battery charger & Rechargeable batteries (AA type); Alkaline batteries (4 in count) last for about 100 snaps.","I've owned this camera for almost a year, I took a major fall and catapulted the camera onto a concrete floor when the camera was 3 weeks old. It's always taken incredibly sharp pictures and very high quality movies before and after the fall, the plastic case held up very nicely also. Unlike the comparable Kodak cameras that need proprietary batteries and docking stations, this camera can use rechargable nim-h AA batteries. The 10x zoom and ISO 400 settings are impressive, but you need a tripod in low light with the 10x optical in use. Later Dimage Zx models stop at ISO 320. The optional top mount flash (2500) works very nicely. The wide angle adapter and a UV filter are also quality options. Do not bother with the digital zoom, any software package can do the same. The movies are crisp and high quality, exceeeding older VHS camcorders. Use a card reader to transfer the movies from the SD card. This guarantees integrity. Ignore the 16mb SD card and buy a minimum of 256Mb, the kingmax line is very reasonably priced.","Although I am not a professional photographer myself, I am sure this camera can give as professional a picture as those $1000+ cameras.  I love to take scenic shots, and I use to have a digital camera with only digital zoom.  So basically there was no chance getting good, detailed pictures of a far-off mountain range or a flock of birds in the sky.  After getting this new camera, I could take shots of a concert from a seat far away from the stage, or take a super close up shot of a spider to see it's details.  The pictures are crisp and clear, and the auto feature where the camera selects the type of picture it should be (whether portrait, scenic, sunset, or some other situation) given the enviroment is very accurate.<br /><br />The camera is not that big of a camera either given that it is an SLR (sort of) and has a 10X optical zoom lens.  I measured it to be the length and width of the size of an average palm of a hand.  The price is nice, and if you hurry you get a $50 mail-in-rebate with the purchase of this camera.  If you open an amazon visa credit card, you get another $30 off the first purchase.  That can potentially add up to $80 in savings.  The price is around $270, so you can potentially buy this camera alone for under $200.  You will need a case and rechargable batteries (costco=>panasonic 2300 mAH rechargables=>$18), and that will add up to roughly about $230 with rebates and all (or $260 without amazon credit card rebate).  The batteries last quite long, and if you plan on taking short video clips, the camera provides VCD quality video as well (up to 640X480 on 30 fps!!).<br /><br />This camera is definitely \"upgradable,\" and by upgradable I mean you can add on a wide angle converter thing that lets you take panoramic type shots (widens angle of lens, which gives you a wider field of view when taking pics).  You can also add on lens filters to sharpen up those day time pictures with the sunshine and glare.<br /><br />This camera is definitely a must buy if you are just beginning to like photography (have an interest in it) and would want a camera that is simple to use, but provides excellent quality to pictures (4MP) and zooms onto objects from as far as 30-40 ft. with ease (and gives great details of that zoomed-in obeject).","This is the first digital camera I have ever owned and I hope it never breaks.  I absolutely LOVE it.  I admit I was intimidated by the very idea of a digital camera, but the pictures from the new 35mm that I purchased did not compare to the quality of my previous.<br /><br />I am not a technical person at all, and know very little about the ins and outs of cameras and photography but I can read and this is a very high quality, user friendly camera that takes great pictures.  I was amazed how easy it was to use and how the manual is so extremely easy to follow.<br /><br /> A salesman at one store tried to stear me away from this camera to a simpler one since I was a first time user.(and this was more for a serious user) Insulted, I purchased from another store and I'm glad I did not purchase the simple Kodak he tried to sell me.  Don't be afraid of this camera!!!  Read the manual to familiarize yourself with it and you are good to go!","I like this camera very much, it has many nice features and functionalities, in a very user friendly package.  The digital zoom is great, the image quality is good, and the ease of use is well thought out.  I would buy this camera again.","I've owned this camera for a few months now, and I must say, I am very pleased with the results from this camera.  The picture quality is just fabulous; they're high quality, and the colors are very accurate.  Even the simplest pictures taken have a professional aura to them.<br /><br />I love the zoom function on this camera.  It's very fast, in the past with other cameras I have always seemed to have trouble finding a camera with a fast zoom--but this camera has pleased me beyond words as far as zooming goes.  Not only is the zoom fast, but it is very silent.  A silent zoom always seemed like an important part of a camera, and I highly applaud this camera for that.<br /><br />There's not much to complain about with this camera--however, there are a few things that I am going to have to complain about...<br /><br />The batteries?  You need four AA batteries!  It's not so much that this bothers me because it makes the camera heavier--because the camera is so well built that you hardly notice the added battery weight--but what does bother me is that this means you have a lot more batteries that you have to carry around with you.  Although, since the camera has so many features, four batteries is hardly a bad thing.<br /><br />After months of owning this camera, and trying out every feature on it, I have only found two flaws.  The first one I noticed was the battery door.  I read plenty of reviews by other customers about the battery door being flimsy, but never did I think that it would be this flimsy!  The battery door feels as if it's going to break in my hands if handled improperly.  However, if you take caution while opening and closing the door, it should be just fine.<br /><br />The second flaw I noticed, was much more conflicting.  The positioning of the flash seems to be a little out of place.  You won't be able to notice this camera defect unless you are taking a close up macro shot.  When you take a shot too close, you will find that while the camera does take a stunningly clear photo--if you use a flash, a shadow from the lens will be left on your photo area.  Even if you don't use any additional lenses or filters the original lens with the camera will still be in the way of the flash.<br /><br />This flaw only occurs, though, when you are taking a Super Macro shot.  Regular Macro will work just splendidly.  It really is a shame, though, since the camera will allow for really close shots to be taken and still come out clear--it's just the shadow that appears when using a flash that ruins it.<br /><br />Those were the only complaints I had about this camera, other than that, I am very much pleased.  It's a great camera for the more advanced beginner to the intermediate photographer.  The picture quality never ceases to amaze me--it's just brilliant to see the photos that this camera takes.  Just splendid.","I was looking for a camera with a better optical zoom than the one I own. The Dimage Z2 fit the bill with its powerful 10x zoom. (I need the zoom for swim meets and candids of my kids and dog.) The Z2 zoom works well. I was worried about comments people wrote regarding blurred photos using the zoom. I find that if you hold still (keep your elbows against your body to stay steady and wait until photo appears on digital screen) there is no problem. The 4.0 megapixels are more than adequate for my purposes and any more would use too much space on the SD cards. I've enlarged to 8x11 with no decline in quality.<br /><br />The positives about this camera are:<br /><br />  * Very light weight even with batteries (4 AA)<br /><br />  * 10x zoom is excellent<br /><br />  * Good optics (and this is what you need in a camera)<br /><br />  * the weird shape actually makes holding the camera<br /><br />  easier<br /><br />  * SD card is tiny and larger megapixel cards can hold<br /><br />  a lot of photos<br /><br />  * The camera is easy to use-all functions and buttons<br /><br />  are well planned and well explained in instructions<br /><br />  * the batteries last a long time and the monitor lets<br /><br />  you know when power is low<br /><br />The problems are minimal:<br /><br />  * case is plastic not metal but this is why its light<br /><br />  * the SD card slot cover is flimsy<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with this camera!","First off, I am a first time digital camera owner.  Have used some at work in the past.  I looked at many cameras before settling on this one and have to say that in the 7 months I have owned this camera, the camera has not taken a bad photo yet, now my shot selection, that is a different subject.  Here are the points that I think are important to know to a first time (and maybe veteran) user:<br /><br />Ease of Development: The memory card slips right into you computer with the adapter that is provided with the camera, and better yet, the card can be taken to Wal-Mart or Costco to have prints taken straight from the chip just like you are taking in film (only cheaper).  If you have an older computer without the proper ports (USB) then you can purchase an adapter to fit older machines.<br /><br />Clarity: The clarity of the images provided by the 4.0 megapixles is truely amazing.  You can zoom in and still have total clarity, better than any high quality film could ever provide.  The color of the images is true to life.  No more exaggerated colors like Kodak or Fuji films had... unless you want that which can be easily done on your computer, or where you have it developed.<br /><br />Battery: In the past, some cameras that I have used burned through the batteries in minutes.  The 1 megapixel camera I used 6 years ago used up 4 AA batteries every 12 shots.  Not that way with this camera.  The batteries usually last a couple months with normal use - 1 month with lots of use, and only takes 2 AA.<br /><br />Video:  While the video is not as versatile as my Sony digital camcorder, the quality of the finished product is better than than most television programs - not too many cameras offer this high a quality.<br /><br />Ease of Use: This camera is perfect for the beginner and the most advanced users.  From the simple point-and-click to advanced manipulation of the lens for exposure .<br /><br />Overall this is a great camera and I am very happy with the operation.  No glitches so far, and we love the shots we get at night with the use of a tripod.  The camera must have some sort of image stability because the camera moves when you hit the button but that does not show up in the image.","This is a very fine camera!  I have tried every feature on the camera, taken pictures in all kinds of conditions and I am very pleased with the results.  I love how this camera functions, and I love the design.  It isn't too bulky, it looks and feels professional.<br /><br />However, even though I am very much pleased with the pictures this camera takes, there are a few flaws that I have found...<br /><br />This first flaw I noticed--the battery door...it is very flimsy.  Before I bought the camera, I read reviews and read this complaint from many other customers, but I didn't not expect it to be this flimsy.  It feels like it's going to break everytime I open it.<br /><br />Another flaw to the camera--the location of the flash.  While taking some really close up macro shots, I found that yes, the pictures were coming out splendidly clear...but I've found that there is always a shadow.  The lens of the camera (even without any additional lens attachments) gets in the way of the flash--leaving a horrible shadow in the picture.  So, I cannot get as close to my subjects as I would like to because of the location of the flash; you can still get pretty close, though.  It's a shame, though, because the camera will allow for closer shots to come out clear, but the shadow ruins the picture...<br /><br />Those are the only flaws that I have found on the camera.  Otherwise, I am very much pleased with this camera.  I will not be needing to upgrade any time soon.","I have had a variety of kodak cameras but sadly never found one I really liked.  The minolta dimage Z2 was just a guess, check and hope it worked camera...I LOVE it.  Have had it for about 6 months now, and dont plan to ever get a different one.  The pictures are beautiful and so close.  I work with a tourist company watching wildlife and by the pictures, you'd think I was right next to the animals!  For the pictures and movies you can get with this camera, it's the best price, completely worth it!!","This is the third digital camera I've gotten, to replace an aging 1 Megapixel Sony Mavica with a 16X optical zoom.  I am VERY pleased with the results, having taken 1800+ pictures in the past three months with only a few minor glitches.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />- This is the first digital camera I've used that can take a sunset picture equal to any film camera I've ever used.<br /><br />- Very speedy<br /><br />- Awesome zoom.<br /><br />- Good battery lifespan (Using Duracell Rechargable ACCU batteries w/ 1 hour recharger)<br /><br />- Fairly light<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />- The camera has difficulties focusing if you use the zoom out on the water (if you go on a whale watch, don't use the zoom, or ignore the focus warnings - whales move much faster than you think!)<br /><br />- A tendency to focus in on the 'wrong' things - like a background when you're trying to capture a small thing (such as a bird) in the foreground.<br /><br />-The battery door is awkward to use - especially if you're rushing to change out batteries.  Once the batteries are in place and the door is put back, it is solid.  The best solution of course is to start out with fresh batteries.<br /><br />Tips<br /><br />-I have found that most of the 'jiggle' problems reported go away if you use the eyepiece - of course the further the zoom goes out, the harder it is to keep stable.  The digital zoom portion of it, like most digital cameras, is not very good, so try not to use it unless there is no other option.<br /><br />- I have gotten a 256 MB SD card for this - it can hold 200 images, although if you're taking pictures along the seashore, you can get 300 images.<br /><br />- Keep in mind that this is good for outdoors - indoors, a smaller camera with a wide-angle lens does better (I still tote my 2MP Canon Powershot A40 around when I'm our on a 'major' photo shoot to get the wider shots)<br /><br />If you're looking for a camera with a great zoom I would have to say this is one of the best currently on the market at an affordable price.","this camera is great. it takes the best pics and easey to use!!!!!!!!!!","In the picture the seems to be quite large. In fact it's small, light and I'd say, fragile by touch. The zoom works very well as well as the two macro modes. The video shooting capacity offers a variety of sizes to choose from. Can't say anything about pictures taken with it being very noisy or anything like that. Picture quality depends on many external factors, and there is no need to repeat endlessly that megapixels alone do not determine the quality and are not the first thing to look at when choosing a digi camera. The camera's three compression modes are ok if we remember that the jpeg format uses irrecoverable compression. The camera came with a 16 MB card plus a 64 MB bonus card. Not too much for shooting videos extensively but for taking pictures it suffices. For shaky hands this camera may not be very convenient.","I have had many digital cameras throughout the past few years and none compare with this one. The design of it is easy to work and very easy to handle. At first it looks like there is a lot to learn, but with a quick review of the instructions I had things pretty well figured out.<br /><br />The quality of the pictures both on the computer and when printed are excellent. The colors are bright and very sharp! I do a lot of traveling and this camera has yet to fail me. I bought it in the beginning of June and have taken it everywhere with me.<br /><br />The zoom feature is remarkable! I can be standing far away from a subject and the photo is still as clear and detailed as if I was two inches away. One particular detail I notice is when I am taking a photo of water or the splashing of water, it catches each drop in detail no matter how far away I may be. I've even caught a detailed photo of a hummingbird!<br /><br />Before purchasing this camera I did A LOT of research and it appears that this is the best professional camera out there for its price range. I would suggest it to anyone. I actually chose this camera over the thousand dollar models because it appears to be easier to take care of, but with just as many features.<br /><br />The memory card that comes with it does not hold many photos, of course. I purchased an additional 32 mb card and that did me fine until there was a sale for the 128 mb cards. I am using the 128 mb card now and get up to 280+ photos at the best quality setting. Which is enough to cover an entire vacation if you ask me.<br /><br />If you're looking for a really good \"almost professional\" camera at a really good price, this is the one for you!","This camera will do everything for you except hold it in place. The auto mode does it all. I was very impressed with the battery life and BRIGHT flash. The camera is just perfect, video mode is brilliant, no noise from the camera's AF feature. The zoom, well seeing is believing, you will not believe the details that you are missing on these 2x and 3x zoom cameras. Can't wait for the next generation. Get one!","What a great camera!  I compared this to a Cannon Elph, and this camera blew it out of the water.  It's real easy to use, it's light, and the auto focus is quick.  From the time you press the shutter button to the time the camera takes the picture is lightning fast.  The Cannon Elph was a lot slower, causing me to miss action shots.  The picture quality is great!","In short, I did a LOT of research, and I found this camera to fit my needs best. The 4MP are more than adequate, the stills are sharp, the menus friendly, the video AWESOME. Well worth your money.","Had the camera for about 3 weeks.  My husband and I are very different camera users (me professional, him amature)but we both had no trouble using it at all.<br />I love the zoom but have been very impressed with the submacro modes and the video.  I bought the 512 card to go with it and it will fit a little over 400 photos at fine on the card.  The video is very nice, though I haven't played with the resolutions yet.  What ever the standard setting is is just great for martial arts competitions.<br />The camera fits really well in the hand and I just love the fact that it takes AA batteries.  We're averaging about 200 photos or so per set of batteries with heavy use of flash, playback and some video.<br />The only thing that I'm really annoyed with is that the lenscap does not seem to stay tight on the camera and i've taken it out of my bag and had it off.  This seems to be a minolta thing.  My old x-570 did the same thing and its over 20 years old.","I have had the Z2 now for about a month. I have taken very many pictures low light, bright sun light, and about every other condition. It has performed very well. I pick this camera for myself because of price and the video function is the best but video is good only for those quick shots. Needs lots of memory. 512mb will get you about 5 minutes in high res.<br />When using zoom near its peak you must have a steady hand. I usually brace my elbows but I have tripod as well. Outdoor light this camera is at its best. I think it out performs any in its price range. The video is perfect in this situation as well and I have not notice any zooming noise in my camera.<br />With night pictures it is little harder to point an shoot. If you are automatic mode, it obivously more delay. It takes little more time to get a picture and video doesn't look very well. Night pictures can be performed well but with some time figuring out your controls.<br />Cloudy days the camera still does very well.<br />I have had no problems with using it with XP. I haven't tried it with a MAC. The flash is one of the brightest that I have seen on a digital camera in this price range. Lights up average size living room with no problem.<br />I do a lot of wildlife photography and I must say that with the zoom I have been very pleased. I have also purchased addition lens but haven't try them in normal settings. The Z2 works very well outdoors with video and pictures. I do a lot of croping and my standard size is a 5x7. It has done better than I expected.<br />Considering features and price, it is very good package and one the best camera in its range and is very lite.<br />I tested for color hazing and it has a little, but it is not noticable to any professional that I talked too. However, this is not professional camera but you get some professional pictures out of it.","I've only had my camera a few weeks, but so far I love it.  Bought mine at a camera store.  When I first got it I was a little intimidated by it, but quickly learned how to navigate through the menus.  It's great!  I've been able to take some excellent photos with it, and folks have commented what great photos they are.  It has a fast shutter speed even without using the sports mode.  My wife took some photos of kids playing ball and it caught them swinging the bat and the ball in mid air.  I thought that was pretty good.  She has took some excellent photos the first time she picked the camera up.  It's easy to use.  I really like the progressive and continuous capture modes.  This makes taking photos of events that are occurring easy.  I love the 10x optical zoom, plus I don't have digital zoom unless I turn it on.  The only down side I've found so far is the photo software included is still a little intimidating to me.  I really haven't learned to use it yet.  That's not really a problem as I chose to use a different photo program that was included with my computer.  This digital photography is great.  No messing with film!  All in all I'm very happy with my camera and am really enjoying it.","I've had my Z2 for about a week and I am very impressed with it.  This is my fifth digital still camera (the last was a Sony DSC-S75).  Other reviewers have complained of poor image quality and noisy zooming during videos.  It almost seems as if they are talking about a different camera.  My Z2 has produced very sharp and colorful images (flesh tones are a bit oversaturated even at the \"natural\" color setting) and the zoom is COMPLETELY silent in the videos I've taken.  One reviewer said the videos cannot be edited, but that is not true.  The camera comes with Arcsoft software to do some crude editing on the Quicktime (*.mov) files, but it also allows you to save the video in other formats such as MPEG, AVI, and WMV.  In those other formats the Windows XP Windows Movie Maker will do additional editing.  I recommend you use the AVI version since it seems to introduce the fewest compression artifacts.  But you have to download the camera's firmware update (version 1.02, posted 04/23/04) at [...] in order to get the sound to transfer along with the video.  When you are at the site you have to navigate to the Z2 page and then select \"software.\"  Another virtue I've discovered -- the camera is efficient in its use of energy.<br />The deficiencies I've found have to do mainly with downloading images and dealing with them once they are in my computer.  The Windows XP download wizard cannot rotate images that were taken in vertical format (as it was able to do with my Sony) unless I first rotate the image in the camera's playback display.  Images come in as JPEGS, with perhaps a bit more compression than I would like in the \"fine\" mode - the file sizes for these 4-megapixel photos are about the same as they were with my 3-megapixel Sony.  When I edit an image and then try to save it again as a jpeg, my Ulead PhotoImpact 6.0 software cannot compress the image as much as I may need.  And my Printmaster 7.0 cannot see the image, though other JPEGS come in just fine.  The workaround that I use is to save the Minolta's image as a Bitmap, close the bitmap file, then reopen it, and then save it as a JPEG at the desired level of compression -- and then Printmaster can see it.  Perhaps Minolta has done something with the EXIF data that these software applications cannot deal with.<br />With a camera that generates such widely differing reviews it might be a good idea to buy it where you can return it easily.  I got mine at WalMart (Circuit City was out of them) for something like $50 more than the Amazon price, just so I could bring it back quickly.  But I'm keeping mine.","I LOVE IT. VERY EASSY TO USED, GREAT PITCHER QUALITY.","I've had this camera for a little over a month and so far, I love it. It's got the full-auto (point-and-shoot) mode for the casual photographer/beginner, but it also has a variety of manual modes and advanced features like aperture priority, shutter priority, program mode, and full manual, as well as manual white balance for those interested in learning the art of (digital) photography.<br />The two built in macro modes (close and *really* close) allow for excellent close-up shots. Despite having almost no experience in photography beyond point-and-shoot cameras, I was taking pretty good macro shots my first day with it (at least that's what mom said ;). The 10x zoom is great for the long shots. The 16MB SD card is useless (pick up at least 256MB). I still carry the 16 for a spare, but at the highest image resolution, I doubt I could fit 10 pictures on it.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy the lens adapter ring and a UV filter for the camera. The UV filter can be had pretty cheap, won't affect picture quality, and will keep your built-in lens safe from scratches, dirt, and UV rays (evidently pretty damaging to camera equipment). And having the adapter, you'll be able to attach other filters as your need/skill grow. Oh, and get a couple of sets of rechargeable NIMH batteries too. They'll save you a lot of money. I briefly looked into the Konika-Minolta LI battery pack that's made for the camera, but being more than half the price of the camera, decided it was more expensive than I needed. At least for now.<br />So far, my only complaints are: the battery cover door seems pretty flimsy. I'd like to see something more substantial. And, I'm not sure the idea of the mechanical mirror used to select the view through the eyepiece or on the display screen is wise. It just seems like more mechanical parts to fail in the future. Also, the use of the eyepiece won't prolong battery life as it would in most digital cameras.<br />So, it's few faults aside, I give the KM Z2 a solid 5 star rating.","this is my 4th digital camra.A nice camra with lot of faults.frist picture quality is very bad and Bluer as compare to my last camera Olympus C-740 .U can not edit movie with sound. In movie recording if U use zoom the sound of lense motor comes in recording. Power button turn on easily accidently . I call customer services to ask the speed of camera read/write they have no idea they just said its compatible . In market there is 512md SD card available at different speed.Memory card cover can be break any time so cheap . Same as battery cover.soon I am thinking for olympus C-770.nice grip. battery is good.features very easy and doog.<br />bottom line picture quality barak my heart.","Dimage Z2 feels good in your hands.  The grip handle has well spaced and placed buttons.  The neat LCD screen/viewfinder switcher option is very handy.  The LCD screen does not fold out for odd-angle viewing.  This camera will not fit into a pocket, but is surprisingly light.<br />The controls are pretty intuitive, but also extensive.  They're a lot easier to understand than most VCR's.  Of course, this might be faint praise...<br />Pictures look fine on my 17 inch laptop screen.  Since I do not print out my pictures much, 4MP is more than enough.  At half the price of the digital Rebel (and the like), I can live with half the megapixels of digital SLR's.  The 16meg SD card that it comes with is completely inadequate.  My 512 SD card might seem like overkill, unless you want to film movies.  Then, the 512 seems just adequate.<br />The movie-mode is the best I've seen on a camera.  If you pick your spots carefully, you can film a wedding in both still and movie modes, and be pleased by both results.  However, the motor on the lense is very loud when employed during filming, and will be noticably picked up.  In other words, DON'T zoom while filming.  The 10X optical lense will make you forget the digital zoom.  If you must go for the digital gusto, unless you've got nerves of steel and hands of granite, use a monopod.  Z2's focus lock option allows you to properly compose your picture with your subject off center.  The focus is fast (if not quiet) and pretty responsive.  The flash is powerful (red-eye reduction), and there is a hot-shoe for a larger flash unit.<br />The 2 AA battery (with AC power option) allows a lot of flexibility.  An optional battery unit is available that pretty much provides enough juice to run a small Irish village (excluding the pub).<br />If you can accept that it is what it is (a consumer camera with lots of neat features in a well-thought-out package), then Z2 deserves its 5 stars.","I've been holding off buying a digital camera as I love my Olympus SLR camera but, whilst looking around my local camera store in February, I was introduced to the Z1 and was told that I should probably wait as new cameras were coming out soon. Well, the Z2 came out and I pre-ordered on the strength of what I'd seen from the Z1.<br />The Z2 has surpassed my expectations - I have some very good quality print outs of my first few images. I even managed to get an excellent close up shot first time that I'd previously wasted at least 2 films trying to get on my regular SLR. Focus is fast and accurate and the camera is light and very comfortable to hold. Definitely recommended."]},{"name":"Konica Minolta DiMAGE A2","amazon_reviews":["I was hoping the lens was removable, but it is not.  Before buy you should check the price of a CF SanDisk.

It works amazingly well, with excellent color accuracy, basically all the features of a Pro SRL (even today's models) and, yes it DOES offer automatic white balance.  Konica-Minolta invented this \"in-LCD\" antishake system which is every bit as effective as the ones on lenses at the time, and (unfortunately for K-M, fortunately for consumers) they were not able to protect their patents fully enough so that imitations are now commonplace.  The size, shape & feel of this camera is actually better than an SLR...it's just slightly smaller to be much handier.  I've used every feature and have performed all kinds of shots, from highest to lowest speeds.  I don't have a single gripe with this camera, its design is simply excellent...and it revolutionized the industry with its mini-SLR form factor, making it perfect for everyone except perhaps a professional photographer who doesn't care as much about portability, and who may go with something like the top Nikon or Canon.

My advice: get some double sided adhesive tape, stick the EVF down in its lowered position and never raise it.<br />Steve acme_widget@yahoo.com","I'm a very avid photographer who bought this camera as soon as it came out (4 years ago), and all its accessories (including a 4 GB microdrive...has been replaced with 8 GB CF card).  It works amazingly well, with excellent color accuracy, basically all the features of a Pro SRL (even today's models) and, yes it DOES offer automatic white balance.  Konica-Minolta invented this \"in-LCD\" antishake system which is every bit as effective as the ones on lenses at the time, and (unfortunately for K-M, fortunately for consumers) they were not able to protect their patents fully enough so that imitations are now commonplace.  The size, shape & feel of this camera is actually better than an SLR...it's just slightly smaller to be much handier.  I've used every feature and have performed all kinds of shots, from highest to lowest speeds.  I don't have a single gripe with this camera, its design is simply excellent...and it revolutionized the industry with its mini-SLR form factor, making it perfect for everyone except perhaps a professional photographer who doesn't care as much about portability, and who may go with something like the top Nikon or Canon. Perhaps the one downside is the poor video, but this feature is an add-on anyway (one would get a real videocam).","I used it in my last trip in Yucatan for the first time, without any previous trial (but I already owned a DiMAGE 7Hi) and results are exceptional without tripod (not allowed in ruins areas without special permit).<br /><br />Very satisfied.<br /><br />I would change it only for an equivalent camera with interchangeable lenses.","I've had this camera since soon after it's release and it continues to delight me. The A2 is not the best for beginners or casual shooters. But, if you are an enthusiast who wants total control of something with a 28-200 zoom that is much more portable than its SLR equivalent, get it!","I am inexperienced and have found this camera difficult to use for capturing images of products. The white adjustment is not automatic and must be tuned each time.","This is the best digital camera I've bought so far. (My fourth.) It consistently takes great photos.  I just wish it was a true SLR.  The viewfinder has a second lcd screen that turns on when the camera is close to your eye so it's better than a range-finder viewer.","The main reasons I bought the Dimage A2 camera was for the manual zoom lens that starts at 28mm, (one of the very few that starts this wide), the tilt adjustable viewfinder, (the only digital camera I know of that has this great feature) and the ability to shoot RAW or RAW + JPEG at the same time, the anti-shake feature and the hope that 8 Megapixels would produce better images.This camera has many more features and adjustments which can overwhelm some people. I had a few of the focusing and exposure quality problems some other reviewers reported but after updating the firmware and spending allot of time reading the manual thoroughly twice also trying different adjustments, I've managed to improve the focus and exposure quality of my photos. A soft focus shot still shows up once in a while though. I think the focusing sensor needs to be enhanced. I believe most people who buy this camera may be a little disappointed with the images produced with the camera at its default settings out of the box. You must experiment and adjust most settings to your taste. KonicaMinolta's own website has an excellent section on the Dimage A2 that clearly explains with illustrations, all of the A2's  features and their purpose. The manual informs you on page 35 that the camera will have trouble focusing on a low contrast area or if it's too dark or if the subject is near a very bright object or area. Also, I strongly suggest you turn Off the Continuous focus setting but keep Tracking AF On in the menu system and not use the default focusing mode, it is not too reliable. By the way, I have read  some posts from other A2 owners that the lens on their A2 has excessive play. Mine has no play at all, it is on solid so I must assume that this was a quality control problem at the factory and may be one of the factors in some autofocusing problems some A2 owners are having. For macro photography you must use a tripod and manual focus for best results. Do not rely on the anti-shake feature too much, it is only activated under some circumstances (read the manual). The anti-shake feature is nice but has its limited use and it is not a substitute for proper camera handling techniques. Optical stabilization is better but very expensive.<br /><br />This is a good camera but, it has room for improvements<br /><br />(as most do). Now that I am very familiar with the camera I am satisfied with it but I was hoping that 8 Megapixels would produce images that would be clearly better than a 5 Megapixel camera's but the images are not better in my opinion. This only proves that there is more to producing sharp high resolution photos than more megapixels. I'd rather have fewer megapixels but better image quality.<br /><br />The improvements I would really like to see are;<br /><br />I wish the Dimage A2 could take advantage of high speed flash memory because it is annoyingly slow at writing data to the flash card, especially RAW and RAW+JPEG. I used a regular Simpletech CF card and a Sandisk Ultra card and Lexar 80x card to see if it made any difference and it did not. Improved discernible image processing is a must to stay competitive in this category of camera. At least a 2\" LCD that could tilt down at least 45 degrees would be an excellent improvement. Reduced noise at all ISO's but especially at ISO 200 and above. A wireless remote control that could work up to 20 feet away would be a great accessory feature. A more powerful flash. A wider and more responsive manual focusing ring and a larger  histogram display in color. An internal focusing lens sinilar to the one on the Panasonic FZ-30 would be very nice. If Panasonic can do it certainly KonicaMinolta can do it. Video should be bumped up to VGA 640X480 30 fps. And of course, improved precise autofocusing in all modes. I hope the A3 or whatever they call the next model in the A line series includes these features if KonicaMinolta has decided to continue this line. I would gladly pay an extra $100 for these improvements because this camera just balances well and feels right to me.<br /><br />I know the A200 has some of the features I would like but at the expense of having eliminated other features which I would also like to have. Oh well, nothing's perfect.<br /><br />The Dimage A2 is a camera for people who are active in photography and like to experiment but don't want to invest a ton of money on DSLR's and lenses. If all you want is to put your camera in program or auto mode and shoot, then buy a point and shoot camera not the Dimage A2. Remember, this camera and indeed, all advanced cameras demand that you invest a bit of time studying and experimenting with them. Also, you must use proper camera handling techniques  to get the best performance from any camera.","Konica Minolta Dimage A2 with Anti Shake Optical Zoom.<br /><br />I own this camera,it was an upgrade from a Minolta Dimage 404 and I love it.<br /><br />I took a cross country trip in September and the the camera performed teriffic in numerous lighting contitions.<br /><br />The Anti Shake feature alone is worth the price.<br /><br />I recommend having several batteries,I carry 3 so that I can having one charging all the time.<br /><br />I also have 512mg compact cards,big pixils you will need large media cards","First off, let me disclose that I do not own an A2: I have an A1 and decided not to upgrade to the A2 for reasons that follow. Also, I am experienced in the use of both film and digital cameras as well as Photoshop and other digital darkroom tools.<br /><br />Here's my conclusion: buy an A1. In moving up the mega-pixels from 5.3 to 8 Minolta made a subtle trade-off in reducing the A/D conversion from 14Bit to 12Bit. The 'A/D conversion' describes how much information each pixel is able to report to the CPU and ultimately, to the final print. If the information is color, the A1 reports 16,384 while the A2 only reports 4,096. Does this matter? If you are using a 'home' version digital darkroom that only handles 8 Bits per channel, probably not. Photoshop CS uses 16Bits per channel in its top-quality mode as does Elements 3, so you should be able to see the difference with the A1 providing the better picture at 'full-pixel' resolution.<br /><br />So, the A2 might make bigger pictures, but they will not look as good as the A1. For most purposes either camera will do a fine job, I'm sure. I have shot thousands of pics with my A1 and the only complaint I would lodge is about the auto-focus in low light: it should be infra-red assisted.<br /><br />Also, save the .jpg settings for 'snapshots' for the web: there is way too much compression done in the camera and you cannot get it back in the digital darkroom. Use 'Raw' where possible and work with PS Elements 3 and you will be very pleasantly surprised.","I've had my A2 for over six months now and I can say I love it. It's not perfect, but for the price it's very good. It's lovely to hold and operate, especially with the BP400 battery grip attached. Knobs and buttons are well-placed and easy to operate.<br /><br />I'm not going to go over all the things I like about the camera. Instead I'll point out the few things I think could be better:<br /><br />- An LCD that would swing out to the side, and tilt up and down more (like on the A200). Some times it would help me take shots easier if I could move the LCD around more.<br /><br />- Less noise at higher speeds. At 400 the noise is trouble some and at 800 it's not very nice at all. Although this is pretty much the same as with comparable cameras.<br /><br />- Faster and more accurate autofocus in low light. Again, many cameras suffer from this, but when there is little light, the A2 doesn't focus very well. Luckily manual focus is pretty good, but you can't always use that.","Ok, this isn't one of my usual hands-on reviews.  I ain't got the kind of money to buy all these cameras and test them.  But I wanted to give potential buyers some help...<br /><br />Should you consider an SLR-type EVF (electronic viewfinder) digital camera or an interchangeable-lens digital SLR for serious photography?  I faced this question and agonized over it for months.  I wish I had come across this brief and very helpful article by Popular Photography Magazine (I'm not affiliated with them in any way):<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The article compares five current-model EVF cameras: Canon PowerShot Pro 1, Konica-Minolta Dimage A2, Nikon Coolpix 8700, Olympus Camedia C-8080, and Sony Cybershot DSC-F828.  It's a very easy read, and at the end the writers give you a helpful checklist for the EVF vs. d-SLR decision.<br /><br />As for myself, I'm going with a d-SLR since I want 1) high-quality lens, 2) lens choices, 3) little to no shutter lag, and 4) accessory choices.  Good luck!","Was debating between the fuji Finepix s7000 and this one.  Nearly the same price.  Made the right choice.<br /><br />Anti-shake has outstanding performance, the twist zoom is excellent and so is battery life.  Picture quality in 'sharp' mode is unbelievable.  Read some reviews that images were too soft, but the sharp mode corrects that.  Battery life is much better than competition but get a spare anyway.  Very satisfied now.","Pro: The camera itself is easy to use. Has a lot of bells ans whistle, which you may or may not need for everyday photography of ameteures. I don't think it is worth the price. If I were to buy one again, I would go for something simple. If you don't worry about every litttle detail in shooting a picture, then the numerous knobs and control will only contribute to your overall confusion. As far as the picture quality is concerned, I did not find it any different (good or bad) from much cheaper camera that my brother bought. The feature that is good is the anti Shake zoom. I have a lot of experience with SLR cameras, and if I compare the optics with those (particularly Nikon) the optics of this camera is only marginal.<br /><br />The software simply stincks !! Minolta can not write a half way decent USB driver. The computer cannot see the camera, consequently I can not transfer the pictures from the camera to the computer.<br />Minolta's technical support is really a joke. Instead of listening to what my problem is , they want to tell me what my problem is!!! And they are so adamant about it.","I've had my A2 for one month (11/11/04). It exceeds my expectations. If you want outstanding prints the A2 will deliver. Film experience will help you get the most from the cam. I've taken a couple of thousand pics with it and I continue to be suprised by the number of keepers! Very,very nice. Read the reviews and believe them. I've sold my film gear. Something I never intended when I bought the cam. Awesome.<br /><br />UPDATE (12/11/04): Still loving my A2. The software that comes with the cam does an outstanding job of editing your pics. I thought I would be using Photoshop to open my pics but so far I really can say I haven't used it.(The photos look a little different when opened with PS, but not \"better\") The Dimage Viewer Sharpens very nicely. I'm printing with my Canon i960, results are outstanding. I still give it 5 stars plus. Sweet. Viewfinder is xcellent and LCD screen is nicest around. Didn't think I would need the viewfinder to tilt up but I use it that way 100% of the time. Also the tilt up of the the LCD makes for some nice waist high shots. If You Want the Number 1 Prosumer cam the A2 is it. Frankly I have no cons. That is sweet! Oh yeah, I finally tried the video recorder and the results are outstanding. You will have to use the Dimage Viewer to get rid of flicker, etc. Once you do so you wil be stunned that a still camera can take video of this quality. I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />10 MONTH REVIEW: Yes, I still love it. Don't believe all the false reports of \"soft\" photos. Not true, this camera's photos sharpen very well with all 5 sharpening tools I have used (software).The Dimage Viewer software sharpens very well. I print 8X10 s and everyone thinks I shoot with a DSLR.(I only shoot RAW format). The anti-shake feature has changed my shooting habits.I seldom use my tri-pod now.I can't see having a cam without it.<br />Every feature of this cam has something to offer the amateur photographer. I shoot a 1,000+ photos a month with it. I get lots of compliments on MY pictures,but the A2 is the real genius.<br />If you like to spend a lot of cash, lug around a ton of equipment, fight dust, and guard your gear at airports get a DSLR. If you don't need the above get an A2! ( I use the Kata H-12 case to protect my cam. Its outstanding.)","I've owned my A2 for roughly 1.5 months.  This camera performs like a champ and am glad that I ended up buying it.  I originally had my eye on the A1, but as soon as I found out about the A2, I wasn't going back.<br /><br />Due to that fact alone, I've been reviewing cameras for the last 7-8 months.  I've looked extensively at the 8 megapixel camera arena.  It really came down between the Sony F828 and the Minolta A2.  In the end I picked the A2.  The raw format is actually usable on this camera as well as the UHS drive mode (allows you to take up to 8 shots/sec).  Another feature thats great on this camera is the anti shake.  Allows you to save up to 2 FStops alone.<br /><br />If you need further proof of this cameras superiority, just check out the reviews online (luminous-landscape, digital outback photo).","\"Playing\" with this camera for a couple of hours before returning it to the store does not give oneself sufficient time to really appreciate what the A2 is capable of. Macro, lens,build quality,battery life,EVF,features & functions,manual zoom & anti-shake all add up to stunning results when you LEARN how to use this camera to it's full potential.","Got the camera with a few dead pixels on the LCD monitor. Did they do their QC?!Returned to Amazon with no hassle though.<br /><br />I only played with it for 2 hours and here's what I found-<br /><br />Pro: auto switch between EVF and LCD, Nice lens with mechanical zoom, anti-shake, fast start<br /><br />Cons: cumbersome control for zoom in/out the photo, manually turned-on flash, no swivel LCD, the CF slot cap can be easily mis-opened (no secure mechanism), movie is limited to 15 min, no hole on the lens cap for a string to hang the cap while shooting, no AC adapter in the box<br /><br />Good news:<br /><br />I just found out that Konica released a new model DiMAGE A200 right after I returned this lemon. There are some new features which should worth the wait, hopefully won't take long. Lord, I'm so lucky out of this lemon A2. Definitely go for the new A200 once it's available.","Choose this camera if you have ever had problems with camera shake.<br /><br />This is my first ever \"pro-sumer\" camera. I upgraded from a point-and-shoot 3.2 mega pixel Sony model because I enjoy being able be creative. If you're like me, someone who is ready for more than just point-and-shoot photography, the Dimage A2 is a good match for you.<br /><br />There is undoubtedly a learning curve associated with the Dimage A2. Since it has 8.0 mega pixels under the hood, making some final touches in post-processing can dramatically improve the final image.<br /><br />One of the Dimage's most beneficial features of this camera is the real-time histogram. I'm also impressed with the quality of the electronic view finder (EVF). Overall, my wife and I are very satisfied with our investment into the Dimage A2.","Having a Konica Minolta DiMage X with which I am very happy, I decided to get this camera when I wanted an 8MP camera with better zoom capability.  At first I was unpleasantly surprised with the amount of noise (color specks) showing in the pictures.  Later I discovered that by putting the ISO setting on 64 instead of Auto, the noise is greatly reduced.  Now I'm basically happy with the camera, but it seems that they should mention this in the documentation.  Pictures at the highest ISO settings (400 and 800) are really bad - I guess these settings are there only for extreme low-light situations.<br />The electronic viewfinder is amazing.  I'm nearsighted and have trouble with the LCD display, but I can easily see everything in the viewfinder (including menus and playback of pictures).  I just keep the LCD off all the time.","I HAVE PARKINSON'S DESEASE, THIS CAMERA GETS THE SHAKE OUT, AND THE QUAILITY IS GREAT. THE PHOTOS ARE CRISP AND CLEAR. OPERATION IS SIMPLE. WAIT TIL YOU TRY THE VIDEO, THE SOUND AND FILMING IS SIMPLE. LOVE THIS CAMERA!.","If you are interested in taking black-and-white photographs for creative photography, A2 is the perfect choice! As compared to other competitors at the similar price and resolution (8 MP), A2 has the following good features. 1. It has a black-and-white mode. 2. The file can be saved as TIFF for artistic editing without losing resolution after repeated saving. 3. The battery function is satisfied. 4. A2 has a rapid focusing and antishake device.","Bought this camera before going to Europe.  Left my Nikon SLR at home.  I have no regrets.  Excellent viewfinder, no digital lag when taking photos, compact, lightweight, excellent zoom lens, long battery life.  We are done with film at our house.  Great for point and shoot, but also lots of bells and whistles for tweaking photos depending on conditions.  Well thought out.  Kudos to Minolta on an excellent product.","I have read others in forums talking about problem A2's and having to return several to get a good one.  Perhaps I was lucky but mine has been perfect right out of the box.  Even my wife who thinks I am crazy to buy so many digital cameras agrees that the photos from this one are fantastic.  As I am getting older the anti-shake feature is a real bonus.  I traded in a Sony 828 on the A2.  The Sony was a good camera, nothing really wrong except a little purple fringe under certain circumstances.  None of that on my A2.  I couldn't be more satisfied.","I should preface this review by saying that I am not an expert, rather a moderately experienced digital camera user who wants to learn more.<br />This camera has it all (read the stats), but some of the unique features include the viewfinder (best on the market - almost like looking through the lens on an SLR), manual zoom, and \"anti-shake\" which gives some protection against shaky hands. I have only had the camera for a few days. I find it to be rather easy to use, even though it is a different brand from my prior digicam (the Canon PowerShot S30). Got outside today and the results were stunning - fast focus, great zoom, impeccable detail, true color (not the \"bling bling\" color some cameras produce that just aren't real). The prints (from the Canon 860) are gorgeous. Indoor shots were typical digicam shots, difficult to take good ones, though we have had terrible light in the house the past few days.<br />It is heavy, for a digicam, but fits my hands well. There are lots of buttons and dials but they feel intuitive to me, again, even though I used to a different brand of camera. I think it would be a hard camera for someone who has never used digital or done much photography, but for  moderately experienced digital or film user, it will be a dream. It uses compact flash (none included, I would get a 512 at least) and a proprietary battery (which seems to last very well, much better than my Canon did).<br />I give it five stars after two days. I might revise my review as I continue to use it, and uncover weaknesses. This camera has an infinite array of features - I know, not literally true -and can do most anything you might ever want to do.<br />Highly Recommend - Enjoy!"]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 4200","amazon_reviews":["Awesome","the camera was sent promptly,, well packed, and arrived inexcellent condition. everything was<br />as described by the seller.. the camera is in excellent condition' asare the accessories. this<br />is a 5 star seller..","This is a replacement for a product that I have used to death in my travels to Europe and Japan.

When the flash is not in use and you're indoors, it's very difficult to get a clear shot with this camera.  The problem with the flash has led me to try to avoid using it altogether so that I can get better color and even light, which means I've had a problem with camera shake/blur in low-light conditions.  For example, with the flash turned off it takes multiple attempts to get a blur-free shot in my living room, even in the middle of the day with the window blinds open.<br /><br />4.  The removeable battery.  You have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it, by inserting it in the battery charger that is provided.  This seems like an unnecessary extra step to me.

The problem with the flash has led me to try to avoid using it altogether so that I can get better color and even light, which means I've had a problem with camera shake/blur in low-light conditions.  For example, with the flash turned off it takes multiple attempts to get a blur-free shot in my living room, even in the middle of the day with the window blinds open.<br /><br />4.  The removeable battery.  You have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it, by inserting it in the battery charger that is provided.  This seems like an unnecessary extra step to me.  Why not just design it so that you can plug the charger directly into the camera like other digital point-and-shoots?<br /><br />For casual photographer who will be shooting mostly outdoors and desires a very portable, durable camera, this camera will work for you.<br /><br />But if you will be shooting mainly indoors or with flash, avoid this camera.<br /><br />I recommend the Kodak EasyShare series as a good alternative.  I don't own one, but I've been impressed with the quality of low-light pictures (indoors) that these cameras produce.","Very nice camera for the price.  My place of employment bought one a couple years back for almost $400.  Now their down to $119.  Takes very nice close ups.  Easy to use.  Very happy with it.","i love this camera! i have had it for a year or so. perfect size, great picture quality, very easy to use and durable (i dropped it once or twice before). great battery life too! i charge it maybe once every other week, but it's probably because i don't use this camera too often. highly recommended!","Found this camera on closeout at Sears new for 86.00, am pleased with the quality and functions, 4 mp is plenty for your average user, red eye works good.  I was uncertain about the rechargable battery, It's always been easier to slip in a couple extra AA's when needed but we'll see.  Some of these batteries have been recalled so check it out on the Nikon website.<br /><br />The screen size could be a bit bigger, but is fine for me.  If you have poor eyesite, go with a bigger screen.<br /><br />All in all I like this camera and would recommend it highly.","This is my second digital camera and it is great.  Within about 15 minutes of opening the box I was up and running.  The manual and the Quick Start guide are great.  The color is good.  There is no irritating delay between clicking and the time the picture takes.  This was a big pain in my first digital.  The red eye compensation actually works EXCEPT if the background is orange or red and the flash starts up.  But any of the commonly used picture software packages can readily handle this problem.<br /><br />The movie mode is good provided you have the memory.  The camera comes with one battery but you MUST have a spare specially if you are going to shoot movies.<br /><br />There are a few areas that can use improvement.  These are:<br />01.  You can store only about 10 pics in memory.  So it would<br />  have been good if Nikon included a SDK memory card.<br />02.  Installing and removing the battery is awkward because<br />  in doing so one has to be careful not to press the click<br />  button.  But then something has to give if you want a<br />  small sized camera.<br />03.  The screen size is 1.5\" a 2.0\" size would have been great.<br /><br />All in all though for the price this is a great value.","I have a Canon EOS Rebel SLR Digital Camera with all the quality and flexibility that this sort of camera entails...but for being able to take family pictures w/o sacrificing all manual control, the 4200 is it.  The price, 4MP, auto redeye reduction, optical zoom, light-weight and small size make it the handiest pocket camera (that can still give you nice picture quality) I have even seen.  One word of advice, as with any digital camera, you need a FAST memory card like the Sandisk Ultra II, if you don't want to w**a**i**t between shots.","One of the reasons I purchased this camera was for the ease of taking close-up photos. There are \"macro\" options easily accessed without a struggle on this nifty tiny, and I mean tiny camera. (Don't let the above specification shot fool you. This camera will fit in your shirt pocket.)If you don't like \"small\" cameras, this is not for you. The access to all options on this camera are easy. The dial on the top allows you to change the menu. Then, press the menu button under the screen and make any changes you so desire. The number of options you have with this camera are only limited by your imagination.  I wish I could paste a picture of one of my fish tanks here to give you an example of the close-up detail. The difference from my previous camera is incredible. The auto-focus was a little confusing at first. It does so much auto-focusing, the picture looks a little blurry on the screen, when you push the button down half-way. Then the image becomes clear. You can turn this feature off. The only real drawback is the battery pack. It's an expensive one. Keep an extra on hand. At least there's an energy saving feature. The default is 60 seconds, which is good for saving the battery, but bad for setting up a shot. You can alter the length of time for the energy saving feature, too. In fact, I think you can alter just about any feature on this camera, except the size, the batteries, and the memory it requires!(Also figure into the cost of this camera a secure digital memory card.)","After 8 months with the Nikon Coolpix 4200, I am convinced I could not have found a better camera.  Photos are as good as any I would hope for.  The auto point and shoot setting has yet to disappoint me, and yet the options for special situations let me make the images I want, easily-- from macro mode all the way to photographing the northern lights.  Menus are a snap to use and intuitively arranged, the camera \"fits\" my hand, buttons are where I expect to find them.  The LCD screen shows clear and crisp images that let me know immediately whether I have the picture I want, or should try again.  And presto, a quick cable connection, and everything loads into iPhoto in no time.  -- Hooked, I keep looking at other similar models, and am convinced this is the one I'm happy to have with me.","Very good camera but I feel one needs to be a little bit pro in operating this camera. Auto mode doesn't always work good. The SCENE-> Indoor/party mode was good when taking pictures indoors and under light.<br /><br />Few photographs still had some red eye. I think Nikon claims that this is the first camera with inbuilt red-eye reduction. Though red-eye is not eliminated in all the snaps, most of the snaps didn't had any red-eye and they really look great. Also, most of the snaps are shaken probably due to the manual movements while taking the picture. But all the photographs taken using a tripod weren't shaken and are really good.<br /><br />The camera performed very good in pitch dark.<br /><br />Except for the automode which was not working well (when compared to SCENE->INDOOR mode)everything in this small package is great. I really like this camera very much. I had a Kodak DX series before in which the auto mode was very decent and works well indoors and outdoors. And thats probably why I feel the auto mode is bad.<br /><br />Finally, I would say this is a great camera. I would have given 5*'s but due to auto mode, I will have to cut one.","I have used a professional quality 35mm camera for the last 20 years.  Was in no hurry to buy a digital camera.  Either the quality was not good enough or it required a mortgage.  My equipment was fine for making art quality pictures, but too cumbersome for parties and trips.  This camera is the size of a credit card and still feels good in your hand.  You don't worry about dropping it.  The print quality is excellent.  Easy to use.  I highly recommend it.  Would suggest buying the extra battery and camera case.  There is very little warning when your battery is low.  Looked at the Cannon cameras and found them too bulky for my shirt pocket and not easy to use.  The zoom control on Canon's cameras is terrible.","The camera has a very nice size -- fits equally well in my shirt pocket and in my hand -- and weight. The built in red eye reduction for portrait photography works well.<br /><br />Don't bother with the picture project software; picasa picasa dot com (for windows) or iPhoto (for Mac) are transcendally better.<br /><br />After an hour with the manual you will love this camera.","Don't get me wrong. I love this camera. It is compact, easy to use and looks really cool. The menus are VERY intuitive. I didn't even have to open up the manuel to figure out all the functions. This is good for when other people use my camera b/c I don't have to explain everything to them. I can also operate the camera w/ one hand. I stis comfortable in my hand adn pocket too. All the auto options are nice, however you can't change alot of stuff manually, so if you are really into do-it yourself photos this isn't for you. If you want to the camera to do most of yoru thinking, the Nikon rocks. I haven't been super thrilled w/ the quality of the photos but then again I haven't been trying that hard to get good pics. The software that comes w/ the camera is really good though and the auto redlight removal built into the camera works great.<br /><br />Best function: continous mode (you can take 16 frames in a row w/ no reload time) great for action shots like football or track.<br /><br />Worst part: has a harder time focusing when the flash is turned off.<br /><br />I like it, but at $50 more than the Canon Elph S410 it's up to you if the ease of use is worth it.","I am by no means a camera expert.  I am a mother of two kids that wanted a quality camera to catch all the \"photo\" moments.  That meant it needed to be small and lightweight enough to carry around, start quickly so not to miss the shot, and above all, give me a clear picture.<br /><br />This camera has done all of that plus!  This is my third digital camera and by far the best.  The pictures are exceptionally clear, complete photo quality!  The buit in red eye reduction is a wonderful feature as I  like to print directly from the camera to a personal photo printer.  My husband was amazed at the quality of the pictures from this camera.<br /><br />I won't get into all of the features of the camera as most people do not use them, but there are plenty.  It's very easy to change settings on the camera as you become more familiar with it and may want to use specific settings.<br /><br />The camera has a very sturdy feel to it in hand, and has proven pretty durable since I carry it everywhere in my purse and it takes the beating my bag does.<br /><br />If I had to say anything negative it would be that you have to remove the battery for charging.  This is not necessarily a negative, just not what I am used to doing.<br /><br />Again, I am no expert, just a mom with some great photos of the kids!","It is barely larger than a credit card and about 1.5 inch thick. It is a metal case but it is very light weight. Picture quality is good and the shutter response time is reasonable in normal light condition. The product description here is incorrect about the movie mode. It can record movie with audio. The quality is good but it is in QuickTime format. That means you cannot play it with Microsoft media player. It is a little inconvenient. But the quicktime file (.mov) is a lot smaller than the microsoft video clip format (.avi). A file of 30 second clip with medium quality is only about 9M. The software comes with the camera is not very useful. The file transfer using this software is slow. I usually pull out the SD card and copy the file to the computer using a card reader."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 5200","amazon_reviews":["I was looking for a replacement of my old Coolpix 5200 when I purchased this one.

So far I've found that it can only support a 2gb sd card.  It has a lithium battery so no more buying batteries.  You are going to want an sd card because it can only save a few pictures on its internal memory.  I do recommend this camera.  It's perfect for me.","I had the earlier model to this camera and put it through a lot of abuse.  It was often strapped to the handlebars of my BMW motorcycle.

I have had this camera for six years.  It takes sharp pictures.  Does a very creditable job with video, and amazingly the sound quality is awesome.  It's small, handy, and pretty ruggedly built, though, thankfully I haven't put it through any unusual ordeals.  The downside is that interior pictures have a lot of distortion. This is more of a point and shoot type camera and will likely disappoint those who are moving from a film SLR, especially younger people.  As I get older, I am less fussy about trying to get THE great photo, but I still would love to see better quality.  The newer cameras have higher pixel ratings, but I would look for more serious SLR type lenses on the things.  Yes, more megapixels are a good thing, but unless you have less distortion in interior shots, you're not going to really make much better use of it.  This is a great camera to have around and handy because of its size and lightness, but I'd look for something with a bigger and more serious lens for any kind of serious work.  I'm quite amazed that the price is still where it is.  I would have thought that after six years this would be a fifty dollar camera.  Yes, I paid a lot more than the current price, but it was six years ago, and I would have thought that the digital camera world would have moved on a very great deal from then.  If you are a young family looking for some nice shots of the baby, and want something handy, this might be a good choice.","I was looking for a replacement of my old Coolpix 5200 when I purchased this one.

The<br />quality of photos is far superior to any other Digital Camera of<br />the same quality.  It's small and packs easily for those vacations<br />that are near and far.","I've had this camera for a little over 2 and a half years.

But for the price, you can get a much better camera for much less.  I would have to say that I was disappointed with this camera in the long run, and I am very happy with the one I have now.","I've owned a few cameras since the digital age submerged the photo world in a sea of memory cards, megapixels and jpegs. I went from a horrible  1 MP Vivitar, to a great but really slow 4MP Minolta/Konica Camera, then to this Nikon 5200 in 2004. Initially, I was weary about buying a 5MP camera, since the technology advances and becomes cheaper within the space of a few months, but the 5200 was not the case. After the first year my first one was stolen and I decided to try out the really slim 6MP Casio Exilim s500 and I was quickly disappointed with picture quality, durabilty and start up speed, before exchanging it for my 2nd Nikon 5200. Last month after 1 year and half of consistently rough usage the battery door came loose and then stopped connecting at all. Even though the battery is still secure without the door there I wanted a new camera and was planning to upgrade to the $1700 Canon 30D, but after playing with the 30D instore, I decided I wasn't ready for that kind of commitment and realized I was genuinely happy with the Nikon 5200. I played around with newer models as well and found that the Nikon 5200 is still a top camera for taking awesome pics in a wide variety of settings and delivering sparkling prints. So I just purchased another Nikon 5200.<br /><br />PROS: 1. Above all, this camera is really fast. That is my favorite feature. With other cameras I find that the start up and picture to picture speed is slow enough that you can miss many great picture opportunities whiles waiting for the camera to warm up.<br /><br />2. Great Pictures in all ranges & conditions. I used this camera outdoors whiles on backpacking & mountaineering trips and always came back with great pics. Macro/Micro/close-up pics are awesome as well. I mainly use that mode for taking pictures of stuff I'm selling on eBay and I've gotten many of compliments from bidders on the quality of the pictures.<br /><br />3. Long battery life. I usually fill up 1GB worth of pictures before the battery meter flashes that 50% power is remaining. After 2 years of lots of use the battery's stamina does dimish some like all electronics using lithium batteries.<br /><br />4. Durable; I've dropped my 2nd one many times, used it in rain, snow, sleet, at the beach and it looks like it been thru war but works like new.<br /><br />5. The Auto Picture mode actually works because the base of the camera is wide & flat enough to sit on ledges, tables, etc... so you can take many self pics where ever you go. I find slim style cameras (which is now the style of about 90% of mainstream cameras) fail at this unless you tote around a tripod.<br /><br />6. Dynamic Flash Modes actually work. Also the Scene modes are easy to use once you understand what does what.<br /><br />7. Video Mode has really loud sound recording and you can take unlimited length clips depending on you memory card'c capacity.<br /><br />8. Nice package in box. Comes with alot a good stuff, software, cables etc.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. Weak battery door clip-in points. Most cameras have this weakness and its not inherent to any one brand. Most cameras' battery door have weak hinges which is alot worse than the weak clip-in points for the 5200's battery door that eventually wears down or break off after a few years of rough use. But in the 5200 defense the battery has its own internal sliding lock that holds it in place so the door in not even necessary to begin with. Also the way the door clip in points breaks is better than having the hinge break because its easier to fix with tape (or glue if you are skilled).<br /><br />2. Learning the various camera modes and figuring out what does what takes some time only because the modes actually work (meaning every mode will give a different picture), and there are a lot of scene modes.<br /><br />Especially when it comes to taking nighttime pictures, unless you are a genius with cameras expect to spend a few weeks to a month perfecting night pics on this camera. They are a few modes for night where you have to determine if you are in normal, party, fireworks, or dusk night then you have to figure out if you want the flash or not, then after that if you choose flash you have to figure out what flash mode you want(party, sunset, fill-in, macro) . The positive thing is when you learn the sweetspots you will find that this camera takes really good night pictures a big positive that is lacking in many reviews.<br /><br />3. Battery Charging. Not really a con as much as it is my griping. I just wished the battery charged like a cellphone/iPod instead of having to travel with the separate charging plug cable & battery charger-block.<br /><br />4. No Sepia or BW filter modes! However the software that comes with the 5200 enables conversion to these filters.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you getting a 5 megapix camera that you want to last a long time and take great dymnamic pictures get this one!<br /><br /> It is also on Steve's Digicams ultimate \"BEST Camera\" list<br /><br />(On the list it is refered to as the Nikon 5600<br /><br />which is a European version that uses 2 regular AA batteries instead of the lithium ones that the 5200 has, other than that they are the same cameras.)","Gift was enjoyed by 13 and 14 year old siblings.  The delivery service was terrible.  I suggest you find another source as this was not the first time I have made purchases from Amazon and I have always been satisfied, but it was the first time I used this outsource.  Never again Cametta Camera.","I started with the Coolpix 4300 but it was painfully slow and temperamental.<br /><br />So I upgraded to the 5200, which I loved to put in my pocket and snap away with, as a simpler alternative to my D70. After a year or two, though, the 5200 would start up with a black screen about half the time. I have to restart it and restart it in the hope that it will get back into working mode. My theory is that this is due to grit getting in the zoom barrel, so my next purchase has been the Pentax W20, which has internal zoom. It seems like that or the two-lens, no-external-zoom Kodak V610 are better choices these days.","I just received my Nikon Coolpix 5200 a couple of days ago and I'm already in love! This is my second digital camera and already I know that we will have many memories together! I like that this camera is small and compact but still has the ability to take amazing pictures. I love the variety of different modes - such as party mode, sunset, and even firework mode. This makes it versatile and easy to use. Out of all the cameras that I looked at while shopping around, I chose this one because of the built-in red eye reduction. I feared that this camera would be a piece of junk because of the low price but I was wrong. Buy this camera, you won't be let down!!","Compare 5 MP sony, kodak, cannon camera, you will see diffrance in Nikon is quality , clear and best color on a objects. Not only on computer or LCD screen it looks good, specially take a print out, you will find print out came out from Nikon is a best.","Great camera for a cam with average lens @ 1/1.8.<br /><br />As others have reviewed, the AF is troublesome. But after I disabled the AREA AUTOFOCUS and left the AUTO FOCUS ENABLED, I found that problem ceased to exist. I also got 2 after market batteries for 4.98 a piece 1000MAh and they last a very long time.","This is a solid camera that takes great pictures.  It is easy to use and has some good controls on it, allowing you to take pictures at different shutter speeds, colors, etc.  The video camera on it provides decent quality video.<br /><br />I have no complaints nor have I been amazed by this camera.  It gets a 4 out of 5.","My previous Nikon (Coolpix 3700) took fantastic pictures, sharp, clear...top notch.  This 5200, although it is more comfortable to handle because it's a better fit in my hands, has been a huge disappointment because it doesn't seem to ever have good focus. I'm an average photographer who would've thought it was my own fault, but having had such excellent results with my previous Nikon, the 3700, I think it must have something to do with this model...or I got a lemon.","Purchased this camera as a gift for my wife when it first came out.  Just did something I thought I'd never do - purchased a second one as a gift for our daughter even though it's no longer being manufactured.<br /><br />Quality of 5Mp Nikon cameras has exceeded my \"tin-eye\" ability to tell one from the other.  Newer ones may have more \"refined\" features but I'm already pleased with the CoolPix 5200's quality.  As the current supply is exhausted, the price is coming down - another good thing.<br /><br />Never thought I'd be happy with anything that didn't have a 5-pound chunk of high quality German ground glass on the front of a big black box!  Because it's so small, we take it everywhere while the big SLR remains in the closet!","Summarizing major issues:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- High definition pictures. Colors are great, pictures clarity is really amazing at times (if you can get it focused - read more of this bellow).<br /><br />- Great Design. Small and compact, so you can comfortably carry it with you inside a pocket or so. Stylish and good looking.<br /><br />- Fairly easy to operate. Navigation in and between menus is straightforward and comfortable. On-screen display is great. The camera also has lots of \"modes\", which are presets of configurations designed for common photo opportunities.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- First and foremost, *Really Bad Focusing System*. Unless you're an experienced photographer (and then again, even if you are), you may lay to it that this camera will take allot of getting used to. Blurry, out-of-focus pictures are common, and you're going to have to repeat shots until you get the hang of it. This is a major issue in comparison to other cameras I've been using.<br /><br />- Mediocre automatic flash system. When using \"automatic flash\", in many cases the camera flashes unnecessarily, creating over-brightened images. You'll find yourself manually turning the flash on and off with this one.<br /><br />- Weak x3 zoom just doesn't cut it, in my opinion.","Nikon Coolpix 5200 is my first digital camera, bought after siginificant web research. I used SLR cameras in the past and was initially reluctant to use digital point-and-shoot. After having used this new camera of mine, I must agree it is not bad at all. Let me list down some positives and negatives that I have noted so far:<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />  1. Very light weight. When I compare with my friend's Canon A85, etc. this one is really light.<br /><br />  2. Clear picture, nice color balance. Quality lens.<br /><br />  3. Decent battery life + rechargeable battery.<br /><br />  4. Great look, nice design. You feel proud.<br /><br />  5. In-built Red Eye.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />  1. The auto focus is not up to the mark. Unless you are very careful, there is a high chance you will land up in out-of-focus shots.<br /><br />  2. The potrait mode comes with default Red-Eye reduction and you cannot permanently change it. The problem with Red Eye reduction is that several flashes are triggered and wastes battery life. Note that you don't necessarily need Red Eye for all potrait shots. So for every shot you need to change the mode to single-flash.<br /><br />  3. Too many modes unnecessarily create confusion. Pictures taken in different modes not necessarily are different.<br /><br />  4. In-built Red Eye works, but not always. I have got quite a few Red Eyes even using Red Eye reduction mode.<br /><br />  5. 3x optical zoom is barely enough.<br /><br />A few tips on purchasing digital camera:<br /><br />  1. Don't go by the megapixel bandwagon. I rarely use the 5 megapixel feature of this camera and almost always use it in 2 megapixel mode to store more shots in my 128 MB flash.<br /><br />  2. 2 megapixel shots are good enough for up to 8x10 enlargements.<br /><br />  3. A good camera is defined by its lens, metering ability, focusing, zoom, low distortion, color balance, etc. They come from the digital processing and the lens function.<br /><br />  Hope this helps.","I bought this camera 2 weeks ago, and I love it!  I have two Nikon SLR cameras already, so I decided to go once more with Nikon for my first digital camera.  I bought an extra battery (batteries take 2 hours to charge, but battery life is good), a 512 mb card, which holds a LOT of pictures, and a camera case.  Most of my pictures have turned out pretty good.  I have had a few that were blurry.  I have also had some reddish skintones, but by trial-and-error, I have come to the conclusion that it was from poor indoor lighting.  The red-eye feature is great, but if your kids more around as fast as mine do, using this feature slows the shutter speed, and you miss the actual picture you were trying to get!  I think the few minor problems I have found with this camera  are due to my mistakes. I have yet to try out several of the other features. You will have little problem with this camera if you READ THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL!!!  I looked over mine while the battery charged the first time.  It saved me a lot of time.  Nikon wins again!","I purchased this camera and have been very happy with it.  It is a great size and weight.  My pictures have turned out great!<br /><br />The program it comes with to edit your pictures has a great email feature...  It automatically reduces the size of the picture from 5MP (or whatever you took the picture in...) to 640x480 for easy and quick emailing.  It sends the picture(s) directly to your email software.<br /><br />I have only 2 problems with the camera...<br /><br />(1) you can't rotate pictures on the camera.  If you take a picture lengthwise, usually a camera (like many Cannon and many Sony cameras) will have a feature that allows you to rotate the picture so you can view it without holding the camera sideways.  Nikon should have added this simple, but useful feature.  You can, however, rotate the pictures once you upload them to Picture Project before emailing them.  But, it takes time to go through each photo and make sure it is positioned correctly for email, but at least you can  do it so people don't have to lay their heads on their desks to view your pictures!<br /><br />(2) the Picture Project software that comes with the camera makes it very easy to post your pictures to Nikon's website, but it takes alot of time to post your pictures to (for example) Ofoto.com or Sams's Club.com.  Both of those companies print cheap digital prints (Ofoto is .29 cents and Sam's Club is .18 cents per print)... I think Nikon.net's price was .45 cents per print (no thanks!).<br /><br />A BIG plus to buying this camera is their technical online help.  They were GREAT!!!  I emailed my questions about my two \"problems\" above and they emailed me back with solutions within 3 days and it was FREE!  I can wait up to 3 days for an answer if it is free.  No problem!!<br /><br />All in all I think this is a GREAT camera and I would purchase it again even with the two MINOR problems I've had!!  It was even rated \"Editor's Choice\" in a few magazine's.  I'm very happy with the Nikon 5200!","It is a great camera. It takes great action shots in the light, good portrait shots anywhere. and really great regular shots. Battery life is great and size is perfect. It just works and does the thing its supposed to do, TAKE GOOD PICTURES. You won't be disapointed.<br /><br />Don't forget to get at least 256MB for memory card)","This is an excellent camera!<br /><br />I particularly like the speed of wich it takes picures in the \"sports\" mode. No other cameras I have experience with is anywhere close to its 2,5 pics per second (you'll probably need a good quality SLR to match this). If you, like me, plan to take action pictures (skiing, etc.), no other compact camera is better.<br /><br />The picture quality is very good, and the \"red eye-fixer\" is working allmost perfectly (I think I've seen red eyes ONCE during my first couple of hundred pics). The user friendlyness is also very good, logical and easy to understand, even for me that have little prior experience with Nikon.<br /><br />The only downside with the camera is the screen size which does not match many of today's new cameras. Besides the size the screen is good, with excellent visibility in most situations. And in my opinion, cameras are constructed to TAKE pictures, slide shows should be on your tv or computer..","I purchased a 5200, primarily due to the $100 rebate they have going with Epson for the Picture Mate.  As it turned out, the camera is very competitive with others and takes great pictures.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Color - I had a Minolta and a Pentax before this and the Nikon provides the best color saturation and true color. The Minolta had a habit of making everyone look slightly red and the Pentax made darker skin people look even darker.<br /><br />- Design - although not as shirt pocketable as the Minolta Dimage X, the new Canon SDs or the Pentax Espios, it is still pretty compact.  The \"handle\" on the right side of the camera makes it easier to hold, but makes it a little bulkier than the other cameras<br /><br />- Flash - a decen flash for a camera this size.  Some of the others I have used can't illuminate anything more than 6-8 feet away.  This camera can go a little farther and wider.<br /><br />- Lens - a true Nikon lense, you can see the difference in the clarity and when playing with the \"depth of field\"<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Pictures can be soft - They look great at 4x6 prints, but you can tell a little fuzziness on a large LCD monitor.  I think it might be on purpose, as I can sharpen up the image considerably using some photo software.<br /><br />- LCD - only 1.5\".  The competition is using 2\" LCDs now.","Hi-I just wanted to say that the guy who gave this 2 stars wrote that same review for a lot of cameras so dont be fooled by there review. Its a GREAT CAMERA!","My hubby gave me this camera for my birthday and I must admit that I love it!  First, it is very easy to use and takes fantastic pictures!  It is lightweight and compact and fits well in your hand!  I have smaller cameras, but I'm always afraid I'll drop them - the Nikon Coolpix 5200 is much eaiser to handle.<br /><br />Previewing pictures is a snap with the large LCD screen, and you can switch from picture mode to sport mode (takes loads of pictures in rapid succession) to movie mode.  The zoom works well and you can even add voice.  Battery life is good - which isn't always the case (you know what I mean when you've taking pictures at a parade and when your child finally shows up the battery has died - argh!).<br /><br />The price is a little steep, but you can usually find it on sale somewhere and the quality and ease of use definitely justify the price!  A great camera - a perfect holiday gift!","This cute little thing works like a mule to get you good pictures.It was up and running in about 10 minutes,after I charged the battery for the first time.The instruction manual,and the layout of the various operations is clear and logical.And the ergonomics of the camera are fine.Feels good in the hand.Not flimsy,as you might expect with such a little camera.The software  was easy to install,and it works well,but it is pretty basic.I just bought PSP here at amazon,and I am anxious to see how I can tweak my pics.<br />I had a perfectly wonderful  digital camera,but it was too large to fit comfortably in my jeans pocket, so I opted for the Nikon.<br />Also..I have read in other reviews that there is a problem with reddish skin-tones,and I can truthfully say I haven't run into that problem at all.<br />Ease of use:5 stars. Picture quality:5 stars(in macro-mode,as well)Cuteness factor:10 stars.<br />Coupled with a quality printer(which I have),I see a long partnership with this little cutie!","I got this camera as a birthday gift and I love it!  First and foremost, it takes incredible pictures.  I've had prints made and they look just as good as the ones from my old 35 millimeter, if not better.  The Nikon 5200 is compact and lightweight, but not so small that it's uncomfortable to handle.  It's easy to use and has a large LCD screen for you to preview your pictures right away.  The zoom is also pretty good, although it took me a little while to figure out how the enhanced digital zoom works.<br /><br />There are a bunch of different shooting modes that you can choose from, and they're very easy to figure out.  I've been very impressed with the battery life, too, and that's a big selling point for me.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fabulous camera.  I suggest shopping around for it online, though, because I was able to find it selling for about $150 under the MSRP (brand new).","slurged on this camera before a trip to europe.  did a lot of research first and decided on the Nikon.  then found it at electricsam.com for $360!  score.  also found cheap memory at bestbuy (256 mb/$35), score again.  the size is perfect - small but no too small to get a good grip on. and very easy to use with all these pre-set options.  i used a bunch of them:  lanscape (w/ and w/out peeps), arcitecture (w/ and w/out peeps), museum, sunset, indoor, portrait, etc.  and the settings really make a difference.  i took some pictures of the alps in austria lining things up with the display on landscape mode and the pictures came out absolutely sick!  we had several blown up (16X20!) and they look as good as the professional photos of the mts in utah we bought last winter.  also very cool b&w and panaramic modes.<br /><br />highly highly recommend the nikon 5200!","While looking for a pocketable and powerful digital camera I tried out the Pentax 555, Optio, Sony T-1, Canon S500...and the Nikon 5200. And the 5200 simply takes the highest honors and my hard-earned cash--$410 from AMPhoto.com!<br /><br /> While each of the cameras I compared and tested are small and pocketable-the Nikon was the easiest to reach in/pull out and \"know\" which end you have-which is important when catching spur-of-the-moment pictures at parties or other events.<br /><br /> The grip and feel in the hand is great and can easily be operated one-handed-unless you have very small hands.<br /><br /> The display is bright and easy to read-even in regular sunlight. The auto-gain for the display the camera uses while \"looking\" at a dark area is ingenious and incredibly useful.<br /><br /> Controls/buttons are well-placed and thought-out.<br /><br /> The menu system is great and very intuitive-no guessing/digging for features in menus.<br /><br /> Pictures simply are wonderful. Contrary to other reviews-I have had no issues with color being off for people.<br /><br /> This is a FAST CAMERA. Start-up is under 2 seconds. Without the flash picture-to-picture time is just over a second. With the flash picture-to-picture time is about 2 seconds.<br /><br /> Nobody has talked about about how FAST the zoom is! While looking at the other cameras I thought all zooms were lethargic-but Nikon's zoom is incredibly F-A-S-T!!! I did heavily consider the Pentax 555 but its zoom was so lethargic that I'd miss the action before it zoomed all the way in!<br /><br /> Macro mode is a blast and VERY good. The focus for macro is as close as an inch which allows you to get up close and personal with the object/subject<br /><br /> The movie mode is just incredible! While not camcorder quality, the 640x480 30 fps rate is great and a lot of fun for clips. I don't know why other camera manufacturers put limitations on the amount of video you can take...but Nikon gets it-if you've got the memory the use all you want for whatever you want!<br /><br /> Battery life hasn't been an issue and the fast charger which is INCLUDED lives up to the promise of fully charging a dead battery in 2 hours. I do wish Nikon had included the AC adapter but no matter...it can easily be picked up for $30.<br /><br /> I would recommend BUY AN EXTRA BATTERY! They are small and light-and you'll definitely be taking lots of pictures with this baby, and while battery life is good-the last thing you want to do is run out of juice when the party is just getting started!<br /><br /> Also buy as much SD memory as you can afford!<br /><br /> **Please note-this is a point-and-shoot camera with a few advanced features to play and have fun with... it takes the guesswork out of pictures. While the camera has a host of features to help you take better pictures based on the situation and lighting, it does not prevent or protect the user from taking bad or poorly composed pictures. Read the manual for the basics then get out there, take lots of pictures and find out how to improve yourself!","This one is indeed stylish in design. An excellent camera in the 5.1MP, compact Range. Small but big on features. With such wide range of features, I am surprised how very intuitive the user interface is. You really dont need the manual. You will be up and running in minutes.<br />Picture quality is excellent in all its modes. The Nikkor Lens with its ED & Aspherical elements, provides an impeccable quality of pictures. Sharp, crisp and vibrant colours. Low light focussing is fast. Interface to the computer? You dont need any driver software if you are on XP, 2000 or Mac. All USB. Just Plug it and you see a drive configured on your windows explorer which you can manage it just like a hard disk. Pictures in seconds!! The 1\"X1\" 256 MB SD memory card can store 270, 6\"X4\" high quality images. Movie recording is smooth, not at all jumpy, very powerful microphone. Treats it just like a picture. Make movie in seconds and send it...<br />I indeed recommend that you look at this one before you make a decision.","I really like my new 5200.  I am new to the digital camera scene but I'm glad I bought the Nikon.  The salesman explained the diferences between the many 5 Meg cameras in stock and I found the Nikon to be the easiest to learn to operate.  My wife is usually the camera person in the house but I believe this camera will be much more fun than a regular film camera.  I love the idea of snapping loads of shots, looking at them on the computer, and THEN deciding which ones to keep. Digital is the way to go and this Nikon is the way to get there.","I have been looking at digital camers for a very long time. I wanted a 5 mega-pixel at the consumer price range that was easy to use and small enough to place in a pocket.  The Nikon 5200 meets these simple needs and far exceeds any other expectation. From the start this was an easy camera to operate. I was taking pictures right out of the box. After spending some time to read about it's other capabilities, I learned that there are some super cool things it can do.  The \"sport\" mode is wonderful. I can take a picture of a golf swing, my son pitching, or any other action shot with a series of 21 pictures in rapid succession. You get to see the progression of the action through each frame.  The Movie mode is also cool. It is very easy to move from pictures to movies. You don't have to be a member of Mensa to maneuver through the options. I love the ability to add voice memos to the pictures AND, this to is very easy.  Nothing complicated about this camera. Loads of options, easy to use, OH and did I mention great looking pictures....So happy I waited for the Nikon 5200.","The new Nikon 5200 is much more compact and elegant than its predecessors. The first thing that struck me was the smooth design compared with the rather chunky 3700, 4300 and 2100. The main reason is the new grip and battery compartment - a vast improvement. The pictures are faultless for amateur use, the lens is above average (somewhat distorted in the edge), much better than the Canon 500, and on par with the Pentax 555.The menu system is very intuitive and easy and most importantly the recycle time is comparable to normal cameras - it has always annoyed me when I have to wait for a digital camera to be ready for the `Kodak moment', no such problems with this Nikon. The only fault I have come across is the rather weak flash."]},{"name":"Olympus D-540 Zoom (C-310 Zoom)","amazon_reviews":["way exceeded my expectations.

This camera was my first ever digicam and was received about 2 years ago.<br /><br />I've been using it for so long and still discover new things I can do with it, and new features. I can't say one negative thing about this camera, even if I wanted to. It's been reliable, easy to use, and takes absolutely lovely pictures! I have heard negative things about Olympus in the past but chose this camera anyway, and am very glad I did. It hooks up effortlessly to my new laptop, and transfering digital images to your computer is so simple and easy to do. I have a 256 card in it so that it holds tons of pictures.<br /><br />Back when this camera was first introduced, it's larger screen was far more rare among other cameras. The screen is very nice and clear. The shooting modes offer a wide range of choices for any shot you could want to take, I especially like the landscape and movie modes. I can take over 5 minutes of video (without sound, the movies on this camera do not have sound).<br /><br />The zoom is easy to operate and the lense has a cover that wraps over it when closed for protection. 3.2 MP is PLENTY for almost any shot you could need, and some of my pictures have come out so beautifully, you would've thought that they were professionally done. I will post a few photos I have taken with it in the \"customer images\" section.<br /><br />One thing I adore about my camera is the total and complete EASE of operation. Anyone could use this, whether novice or professional. My grandfather has loved photography and been a photographer for many years, and he also agrees that this is a great camera with great features.<br /><br />When I decide it is time for an upgrade, you can bet I will look at Olympus cameras again, the only other I would buy is a Canon, which are also fantastic. For the price however(I'm a college student with a double major and work only part-time, so money is tight), Olympus is the way to go. The ratio of quality to price is untouchable.<br /><br />I've taken this camera to college, on vacation, out for nights with my friends, and just used it around the house... and it's performed beautifully each way. The fact that it is compact and light enough to not be cumbersome, yet still feels sturdy, makes it easy and un-obtrusive to bring anyplace you go.<br /><br />If this camera will be as good to you as it has to me, don't have any worries. It will last a while if you take good care of it. It's been a joy to use. Just make sure you buy lithium batteries (AA's simply DON'T cut it), and you're good to go.","I have purchased two of these cameras at seperate times as gifts because of the excellent quality and easy to use features of this model. Only one drawback i have encountered is the battery life is relatively short if using standard batteries .Owners may want to think about upgrading to rechargable lithium batteries.","I have had this camera for a couple of years, we paid a lot more for it when it first came out.  It takes pretty good pictures although if the flash isn't on, they turn out blurry.  I don't know why this happens, but it makes it difficult when needing to snap the shot without the flash on.  I have noticed that regular batteries don't last even one day in this camera, although the Lithium ones last several months. It is worth it to spend the extra money on them.  I have learned that making the size of the photo smaller makes the pictures look a lot less clear when you try to develop them.  It is defaulted to the 3rd largest setting and it's for a reason, they're the ones that turn out clear, very clear in fact.  I really like it, takes great color shots and even does great in the Sepia setting.  The camera is very user friendly and even when it's pitch dark, the flash lights up the area and takes great pictures.  Also, the flash hasn't given us any \"White out\" pictures, it seems to have just the right amount of flash for almost any picture.  I really like this camera, it isn't top of the line, but for the price that it is now, it's a great buy.  I really like it's durability also, a few weeks ago at a family gathering, my little sister pushed me in the swimming pool not knowing that my camera was in my pocket.  I took out the memory card and batteries and let it sit on a dry towel all night, it dried out and works great to this day.  I even developed some pictures I had on the memory card and didn't have a problem at all.  She was worried, feeling that she would DEFINITELY have to replace my camera, but it was a trooper, it works great to this day, took a few extra days for the LCD screen to dry out completely, but it did.  I gotta say, this camera is AWESOME in that respect.  Hope this helps.","I purchased the Olympus D540 about a year and a half ago and it worked fine at the beginning. It had no lag, started up quickly, and took pictures fine. Then I noticed wear that came from nowhere. Cheap parts. The camera took an unusually long time to startup, even with brand new batteries. It flashed black every time I turned it on. Eventually, it just stopped working altogether. I've tried replacing the batteries, and I've tried Olympus for help, but they have absolutely nothing. They have the worst website information I've ever seen. They didn't even have a FAQ of common problems as they're too busy releasing new cameras with cheaper parts every 3 seconds to pay attention to their current customers. This camera sucks. If you're looking for something that will last and not break down on you, then you should be looking somewhere else. This has completely soured me on digital cameras since it seems that all of them break down, are horrifically expensive especially considering you need a memory card, battery charger, warranty, dock if you want to print, ink, etc. The memory card included with the camera could only hold 20 pictures!! I had to purchase another one for $40. I'd suggest that you stick with regular cheap cameras. Until they start making digital cameras cheaper, stop releasing new ones and lowering prices for old ones, providing more in the package, and offering better technical support, I'd say don't bother with them at all.","Having already used my Mum's Olympus C-100 (1.3M) for about a year, I decided to take the plunge and buy a camera of my own. After extensive searching through many reviews, I was pleased with what was written about the C-310 Zoom (UK version of the D540). Part of my work involves very close up shots and I have had some excellent results using the super-dooper-zoom feature. I don't print many photos but they look spectacular on my laptop screen and I can zoom in really far before the pixels become apparent.<br /><br />My one beef is the battery life. I have since read a couple of reviews that claim the 'low battery' indicator comes on too soon. If you're clicking like crazy and using the LCD screen, it will drop quite quickly. I tend to set up my shot with the viewfinder, use the screen to double check the framing then turn it off and shoot.<br /><br />I also picked up a valuable tip on memory cards. Get the largest card you can afford and shoot away. That means more battery power for shots - you can weed the rubbish ones when you download to your computer. I have a 256MB card and I have never filled it - I think the most photographs I took were 273 out of the possible 320+ HQ images.<br /><br />I have also used this camera to produce stereoscopic pictures with excellent results when printed.","A number of reviews have complained of short battery life. I discovered that there is a rechargeable lithium pack now available for this camera. I ordered it with a special charger from an online source, and am now satisfied with the battery life. Also,the lithium battery pack does not lose its charge like the NiMH batteries do.","I base my 5 stars on how this camera has fit my needs and exceded my expectations. It's my first digital camera and I have read a lot of reviews about it. Everyone has their own list of pros and cons. I guess that they are all \"true\" for the person who has experienced them. I got into digtital photography after throwing out thousands of 35mm slides and photographs and swearing off of collecting phots any more. My 30 year old Asahi Spotmatic sits on the shelve. Then, I started to think about the digital concept. Why it's just a lot of electrons arranged in a lot of 1111111111s and 0000000000s. And so easy to \"develope\" and \"throw out\". Easy to carry in the forest and so convenient for taking pictures that I really have no intention to save or develope. Well, I do save a few...but just electrons, remember. I love it!<br /><br />I cracked the LCD screen after a few months. Oh, fiddl-faddle! Well, what to do?<br /><br />I decided to order an LCD replacement from Olympus and fix it myself. I thought...\"what the heck, it's that or throw it out. So, I'll gamble the $70 for the LCD and try to repair it myself.\"<br /><br />It was a little scary at first. But I did not care if I fatally messed up the camera. I took out all of the little screws I could find and pried the back off of the camera. There I found more small screws holding the LCD in place. There is a tiny two conductor cable with a tinsy two prong connector on it. Also, the LCD is attached to the camera electronics with a tiny ribbon cable. I took out more screws and used tweezers to disconnect the cables. The two conductor red and white cable has to be de-soldered and re-soldered to the new LCD. The LCD bracket has to literally be pealed off of the old LCD and reused on the replacement LCD. Will it work? It put everything back with no parts left over! And it worked!!!! Let me confess that I have worked in the electronics industry, so I am not too intimidated by the computer \"guts\" of this camera. However, I think it really was my \"I don't give a hoot\" attitude that got me through this repair.<br /><br />Olympus Parts Department is not very easy to deal with. Some rude people and some helpful people. After gettting 3 different prices, each higher that the last, I ordered the part. I did not receive a new screen. It had a date tag on it from the previous year. No one said it was a used part on the phone ! It was back ordered and took two months to come in. I was so tired of dealing with Olympus that I used it and all has turned out well in the end.<br /><br />I can shoot all of pictures that I desire and a movie or two on just the 16 meg card. I never print photos, so the 16 meg card will hold about 135 email quality pictures that I can send to friends and they can easily throw out. Who needs the clutter! I got a deal on a 64 meg card so I got that as a backup.<br /><br />I love this camera. It does all of the good stuff that other reviewers say and more. I think that most negative comments are from people who are very particular about some feature or expect this camera to perform outside of its price range. It does a great job, is easy to use and repair, easy to carry (don't bump any concrete walls with the LCD) and has lots of features to explore.<br /><br />Prices are going up with the pixel count. I don't want more pixels. Probably 1 would do for most internet photos. 2 would give good 4x6 prints. Where are these simple, cheap cameras ?<br /><br />I guess they are where the simple, cheap cars are ??????????","1st, BELIEVE THE HYPE !  The image quality is TRULY AMAZING! GORGEOUS, TRUE to LIFE COLORS! They are about as close to a 35 mm photo as I have seen (including those from cameras costing 3-4x the price!).  The salesman at my local WOLF camera store (who is very knowledgeable) was surprised that the pictures I developed were from a (3 MP) digital camera.  YES-THEY ARE that GOOD.  And I am not easily impressed (anymore).<br /><br />2nd, I am by no means a \"novice\" when it comes to digital cameras.  I have lost count as to how many cameras I have bought and sold over the years in my futile attempt at finding \"the perfect camera\".  It is my belief now that there is no \"perfect\" digital camera that will fulfill ALL of your digital needs.  You need to prioritize what's important.  For example, if video with sound is very important to you, you can rule this camera out.  However, if image quality ranks HIGH on your list, please keep on reading my review.  I have tried all of the really tiny, expensive cameras and have ultimately, always ended up disappointed by its picture quality.  My \"BIG\" camera (which I highly recommend) is the Panasonic Lumix FZ20.  This has become the perfect \"take anywhere\" camera for me.  I like it better than the Sony P200 that I paid over 3x for.<br /><br />3rd, a term I just coined for this review is \"megapixel smegapixel\".  Four years ago, I paid a thousand dollars for a top-of-the line 3 MP camera (Nikon Coolpix 990).  To this day, that camera has taken some of the best pictures including those from 5 MP cameras like the Nikon 5200 or even 7 MP camera like the SONY P200.  The thing is that the higher the megapixel, the higher the incidence of NOISE.  99% of us do not need a 7 MP camera.  It's simply overkill and the pictures, ironically, often end up looking more GRAINY than a picture from a great 3 or 4 MP camera!  Even though this is \"only\" a 3 MP camera, that is enough resolution to print up to 11\"x14\". So, don't get too caught up in the \"megapixel race\".  You just end up paying a lot more for something that you don't even need! This camera proves that you don't need to spend $500 to get a great digital picture.<br /><br />Finally, like all cameras, there are the \"cons\" which other people have alluded to - namely, the short battery life and relatively long shutter speed.  If you are trying to capture a toddler on the loose, this is NOT the camera for you!  But I find it more than acceptable.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: NOW, FOR THE MAJOR ISSUE OF BATTERY DRAINAGE - I read ALL of the reviews on Amazon IN FULL and no one has yet mentioned that it can also use CRV3 battery which lasts longer than rechargeable \"AA\" batteries.  Or even better, that for $30, you can now purchase rechargeable CRV3 batteries !!!!!  My favorite is the one by MobyPower, sold here -<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Also, I always use use a Card Reader to download photos from my cameras instead of draining battery power. I'd recommend you buy a separate card reader - they are very inexpensive and will save you lots of money on batteries!<br /><br />Fianlly, I paid less a tad over $100 for mine.  In my humble opinion, dollar for dollar, this is simply ONE of the BEST DIGITAL Cameras out there.  Whether you are entering the exciting (but often intimidating) world of digital photo,or you need a great Second Camera, this camera should more than satisfy you, without leaving a dent in your pocketbook!<br /><br />IMPORTANT UPDATE : As of April 2005, If you want video with sound, you can buy their NEW 5 MPG D-595 camera for only $50 more !","I was looking for a 3 megapixel camera in the price range of $150.  This camera definitely fits the bill and is totally worth it.  You'll just need to invest in a good set of rechargeable batteries because standard AA's won't last long.  Other than that, this little camera is impressive.<br /><br />The D-540 is not the most stylish-looking camera, the body is plastic, but the pictures it captures are remarkable.<br /><br />I recently went to Aruba and took this camera.  The pictures turned out sharp and vibrant.<br /><br />I've had experience with Olympus and Nikon digital cameras before the D-540.  I think this is one of the most encomical 3+ megapixel point-and-shoot cameras out there.  I highly recommend it.","1. Pictures come out VERY crisp and clear.  Love them!!!<br /><br />2. Size is fantastic.  Can put in a small purse and carry around.<br /><br />3. Batteries get used up at a ridiculous rate.  Even after I bought rechargeable batteries with 2300 MAH, they still get used up too fast!<br /><br />4. Price is great.<br /><br />5. Very easy to transfer pictures to computer.<br /><br />6. Sleek look.<br /><br />Overall:  Although I really love the output quality of my pictures, I would not buy this camera again.  It is just too much worrying about when the batteries are going to die so I always have to cary 8-10 batteries JUST IN CASE!!!","I was looking to spend a couple hundred dollars on a camera but not expecting to get much for the money I had. This little camera far exceeded my expectations. Get great buy, especially for the price. Easy to use. Very nice quality of pictures.","I have taken more than 1000 pictures with this great camera. Here are my opinions on it..<br /><br />Positive Stuff:<br /><br />1. Excellent picture quality. No doubt, I liked the picture quality more than a Sony Cybershot 3.2 MP camera.<br /><br />2. The most powerful flash I've ever seen. The camera can take a good picture in complete darkness.<br /><br />3. Decent battery life. Even though the camera might indicate a Low battery indicator soon, it actually lasts for a long time. I used Panasonic 2100 mah rechargeable Ni-MH battery. I got about 32-34 pictures (all with flash). If you actually turn off the LCD display while not using it, it saves a lot more battery power.<br /><br />4. Transferring images to a PC is pretty straight forward.<br /><br />5. The camera is compact and light as well. It was able to fit in to my jean pocket!<br /><br />6. The camera makes good judgement when to use flash and when not to use. At the end of the day, we are totally satisfied with the image quality.<br /><br />Negative stuff:<br /><br />1. The camera is just too slow to respond, particularly, if the battery is low.<br /><br />2. There were occasions where I had to take some moving objects, but just couldnt time my camera to take it. The response time between pressing the trigger and the camera firing is about 1.5 to 2 seconds (which might be too late sometimes).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />1. If you use a rechargeable battery with a good MAH, the camera is pretty neat.<br /><br />2. What matters at the end of the day, is people should get good remarks about the photos they take and I get that all the time when I use this camera.","I have always love Olympus image quality, the colors are great and the lcd discplay shows exactly how the picture will look like when you get it into the computer, the pictures look alive, i compared to other digital cameras such as HP, Kodak, and there is no point of comparison, Olympus Rocks!!, the only problem with this model is the battery life, i recommend that yo turn of the display, disable the flash when you dont need it and get rechargable batteries, and carry them with you every time.","The camera takes great pictures. The only things you should know is that the flash is a bit slow, and the slider to change modes sticks and is hard to put into the picture-taking mode. Other than that it's a good deal for your money.","A x-mas present that blew me away. The camera is small and very portable. The battery problem is a concern. The low battery light came on within the first hour of using the supplied batteries. I put in new 2300mah batteries and had the same problem ,although they never actually went dead. The power-saver feature does work, despite another review I read. The xd-memory is a draw back, being new and $10-20 more than Sd media; xd is half the size of sd however.<br /><br />Overall, while I am pleased with the camera; a little upgrading would be worth it. The 540 takes short movie clips, but has no sound. The 560, for I believe $10.00 more, has audio.","This ia great little camera with so many extra's jammed in it its hard to belive how easy it is to use with them all inside! but it is SO easy, with amazing picture quality, which is so much better than other digital camera's which claim to have the same quality images (kodak for one) i really recomend this camera. i did have some problems with battery life but you can avoid this. first by linthuim batteries they last heaps longer. also, turn your flash off when you don't need it, and don't use your zoom when you don't need it because these whaste battery! turn your camera off once you've finished taking photos, in till the next opputinty, don't leave it on waiting for another photo opputinty to come alomng-this whaste power. also, i have found that if it runs pretty fast from usung it over and over again, leave it for a while, then turn it on, you might be able to get a couple more pitures out of it. and last but not least, carry battries with you everywhere! but paying for battaries is a small price to pay for the picture perfect, professnal look this camera gives your pictures<br /><br />two words<br /><br />BUY IT!","The camera has exactly what I was looking for. The image quality is very good, its easy and simple to use and a great value for the price. The night mode is excellent, but be careful not to shake when shutter is open. Tripod recommended when using in night mode. Don't worry too much about the battery life, you will be ok if you have a two pairs of rechargeable ones.","There are not enough superlatives in the English language to describe this device.  Suffice to say, it is a fantastic little camera.  I'm a digital photographer who decided that his 4 year old (that's right, FOUR) was going to get a digital camera from Santa this year.  Well, she and I couldn't be more pleased.  As a point and shoot, it doesn't get much easier than this.  She's taken over 200 shots since Christmas day and they are near flawless even if her choice of subject matter does lead to some amusement (I think we have over 50 \"My Little Pony\" shots on the computer now).<br /><br />  Previous reviews indicated the need for a couple of sets of rechargeable batteries (this camera only requires 2 AAs instead of the typical 4) and a larger memory card (get at least a 128mb XD, though it wouldn't hurt to spring for the 256mb).  They are correct.  Add a small camera bag and you're set.  My little one is.  Though arguably brilliant, if she can do it with this camera, so can you.","I would not be writing this except for the fact that I found these reviews so Helpful at Christmas when I was looking for a camera and other items. I brought this as a gift for my son, who had no idea he was getting it. He has never been into electonics or computers so the ease of use that other people stated was a big fact in my buying. My son was surprized with the Gift and taking pictures in minutes of opening it. He told me the camera was Great and easy to use, when connected to the USB port it pops up on the screen asking if you want to send pictures to the printer or computer. He said it was Very easy to use and figure out. The batteries are the negitive thing just as everyone else had said. It uses them Toooooo Fast! But from all the reviews I read on the other cameras it sounded as they all do. We have some Rechargeable on the way, I hope they help.","THE BATTERY LIFE SUCKS! I recently went on a trip to Europe for 2 weeks, took 2 12-packs of energizer e2 titanium batteries and I wasted them all in the first week, I had to be buying batteries at every stop. So I've decided to buy the Olympus B80SU NiMH Overnight Battery & Charger Set now.<br /><br />Other than the battery life problem, this is such a great camera.<br /><br />Its really easy to use, the lcd screen is big, which is great for previewing pictures, and the menu is clear. The camera itself is a great size, not too small and not too big, it fits in your pocket. The picture quality is really good, theres also 4 options of picture quality;SHQ-2048x1536,HQ-2048x1536, SQ-1600x1200, SQ2-640x480(HQ is the default).","After much deliberation I purchaced this camera to take pictures of my new son; knowing Olympus's great quality and userfriendly apperatus I did not think I would be dissapointed, I was not.<br /><br /><br /><br />The photos from this camera, particularily in superfine mode are outstandingly crisp and clear, after ordering prints online (including 8x10s) I realized what a signifigant purchase this was there was virtually no difference between the prints and photographic prints.<br /><br /><br /><br />Two hints for anyone wanting to buy this camera however<br /><br />a) buy the 256mb card it is worth it for the 115 SHQ shots you'll get<br /><br /><br /><br />b) it is absolutely nessessary to buy a battery charger with four Ni-MH batteries. These will last you one whole day. about 70-80 shots.","My title says it all - the ease of use is nullified by the fact that there is not a valid batter option. This camera operates on either two AA batteries, or one lithium battery. Here is the problem - it burns through them at an umbelievable rate!! If you are planning on taking lots of pictures at once (on vacation, or taking the kids to the zoo, etc), one set of AA batteries will not even get you through the day. You will easily need two or three sets of AA batteries to get through a day of heavy picture taking. That really starts to add up! I tried buying two sets of rechargables with a charger, but the first set of batteries will run out before the second set has enough time to charge. You would need two or three sets that could be charging simultaneously to keep up. I then went to the litium option. While these do last longer, they still only last about 10 days with limited picture taking. Again, if you were in a situation where you were taking lots of photos, you would probably need one lithium battery for each week. At about $10 each, that's gonna add up quickly as well.<br /><br /> To make matters worse, you burn the batteries when you are downloading your photos to your computer, and there is no \"safety\" that turns it off after a minute of two of not being used. So it is easy to hook it up, download your pictures, get busy managing your photos and forget that the camera is still on. An hour later - dead battery!<br /><br />For the record, my mother has a different model of Olympus camedia that comes with its own rechargable battery, and it is much, much more practical. I would definitely recommend paying more to aviod going broke buying batteries!","this camera provides clean solid basic pictures also allow you to be able to have good images for moving pictures.I would suggest this camera to all people interested in a good digital camera.<br /><br />Rakesh","The Olympus D-540 is a good camera for the money. I hear that the digital zoom causes grainy photos, but have found this to not be so. It is a little slow to shoot, but this allows for some last minute aiming. The self timer is a little extraneous, as is the micro zoom function. The video is nice, but if you want a longer video, you'll have to purchase a larger memory card, which I have yet to do. You can save your settings which is nice, especially if you want a smaller size picture which takes up less memory, or if you use the digital zoom frequently.","This is my 3rd midrange digital camera in as many years.  I picked this one for my latest based on it's features (macro, self portrait, etc) and the awesome huge LCD screen.  The screen is much bigger than it's competitors.  The self portrait mode worth noting... some one was finally genius enough to note that many a snapshot is taken where two subjects squeeze together and hold the camera at arms length and snap the pic.  This setting adjusts the flash and lense to accomodate that!  Genius!<br /><br />The downsides... even with rechargable batteries this sucker goes \"battery low\" way before other digi's I've had.  It's worth noting.  I think it runs out about 30% to 50% quicker than other camera's I've had.  That's pretty notable.<br /><br />Also... the bootup time is Loooonnng.  When turning on the camera, the time between turning it on and actually taking a pic is way too long.  Also the lag between shutter press and actuall photo/flash is incredibly long.  MUCH longer than other cams I've had.<br /><br />You sacrifice a few things here and gain a few there with digi's but, the lag time and battery life are deal breakers for me and the type of pix I take so this puppy is going back.  :(","I bought one of these cameras for my 16-year old daughter.  Within minutes she was able to take photos with it and enjoy the world of digital photography, including shooting a short movie.  The camera has a 3x optical zoom which allows for better close-ups.  It has a few drawbacks, but as a beginner's camera, it can't be beat, especially for the price.  Best to buy the rechargeable batteries, as these cameras eat up electricity, and also a bigger picture card so that you can load up on the photos and enjoy a little home movie making.","I love this little camera. I had a chance to try out this camera and compare it to three other digital cameras. The Olympus 540 won hands down. This is the camera I take with me every day. I own a better camera, but like the size and ease of use of this camera.<br /><br />I took identical photos with this camera and a 4 mg pixal camera and you couldn't tell the difference in a 8x10 print done on a color laser printer. I also enlarged and printed a 48\"x36\" image on a large format printer and was extremely please by the results.<br /><br />The camera is easy to use. In seconds you can choose anyone of the eight shooting modes. Also, adjusting the flash to be auto, always on, off or a fill flash is a quick click on the back control button. By pushing the shutter button half way down you can set your exposure.  This is very helpful in some lighting situations.<br /><br />If you purchase the camera, I would recommend buying re- chargeable batteries and a larger storage card.","I must say, this is my very first Digital Camera and it's great!<br /><br /> First of all, the flash is powerful! I took a picture of my roommate in his room with the lights off....so I just changed the mode in my camera to \"Night Mode\"...the picture came out bright! Great for bars, clubs, etc (small enough too)!<br /><br /> The Menu is extremely easy to use. It took me about 5-10 minutes and I got used to the options.<br /><br /> The pics come out very clear.","I received this camera as a gift and subsequently took it on a long trip to Russia (instead of my bulky SLR film camera). This camera was outstanding: easy to use, produces good quality pictures, lightweight. It makes toting \"regular\" camera gear around too cumbersome to contemplate: this camera slips into a pants pocket easily enough. As my first digital camera, it's everything I had hoped it would be and more.<br />The software (Olympus's Camedia) is pretty good and relatively easy to use, although managing your pictures can be more work than it needs to be. Maybe I'll upgrade that to the Pro version. Nonetheless, I was downloading pictures quickly and everything worked cleanly. The main reason to use the software (rotating pictures) is convenient.<br />The camera itself is lightweight and pretty durable (my son dropped it a few times and it survived just fine). The 16 MB card that comes with it is too small for realistic use, but a 128 MB card is easy to purchase: budget for it, as you'll want the storage. There are only a few minor annoyances that you'll want to compare to other cameras before choosing this one (I don't think anyone else does it any better).<br />First, this camera (like many digital cameras) devours batteries. The \"low battery\" warning comes on very quickly--way too quickly, since battery life far exceeds the warning. However: as the battery runs down, the camera itself processes more and more slowly. So I've found that you'll often miss shots because you need to know about a second in advance to push the button. The lag between \"go\" and the camera firing is annoying.<br />Second, the zoom control is a bit difficult to use. It's located on top of the camera and twists, an action that I find difficult to perform while aiming the camera. I've taken to holding the camera at about chest level to shoot pictures so that I have better control.<br />Overall, the picture quality settings are easy to manage and the pictures themselves are bright, clear, and sharp. The autofocus is almost always perfect and you'll rarely dig into the menus to adjust the camera performance. The panorama capability doesn't seem to work, but it's an extraneous feature.<br />In any case, this is a great little camera. It does everything a digital camera should, is well made, and makes me a happy camper.","This tiny, light and easy to use camera is a perfect choice for those who aren't professionals, but in some cases even for those... the Super macro mode, which lets it take pictures from 2 cm away, is awsome, and you can't find this on no other camera inn it's price category...It takes great crispy pictures and it has a super-powered flash light.. Except it doesn't record sounds...it's the perfect camera.","I searched high and low for a new digital camera, buying and returning 4 different cameras in a week before finding this awesome little Olympus. I tried cameras from Kodak, Fuji, and Canon and none of them compared to this camera. It is small, simple to use, and affordable. First off the LCD display is extremely crisp and clear and the menus are very user-friendly. The camera starts up fasts and takes pictures relatively quickly also. I will say, it is not the best with batteries.(a common problem in digital cameras though) Just invest in some good rechargables, it's worth it. Anyway, my pictures, snapshots and closeups, come out very sharp and look comparable to those taken with a 5mp camera I have. I think if you are looking for an affordable, portable, great new digital camera invest in the Camedia-540.","I have the Canon A80 (4.0 Megapixels) and also bought this new camera (known over here as Olympus C-310) recently.  While the Canon may have a 1.5 inch swivel LCD screen, this camera has a larger & more pleasant 1.8 inch LCD screen, definitely takes SHARPER pictures, and has less chromatic aberration (purple fringing).  It does have slightly more picture noise (i.e. digital 'film grain') compared to the Canon, but you will notice this only if you have a keen eye for it.  (the extra picture noise probably arose from the more aggresive sharpening algorithm employed by Olympus as compared to Canon)<br />The heavier & more solid Canon uses 4 AA batteries and last for hours upon hours even on alkaline batteries, but you can only take a few more shots once its low-battery warning flashes.  In contrast, the Olympus uses 2 AA batteries only and is therefore much lighter, but one caveat - on both new & newly charged rechargeable 2100mAH NiMH batteries (2100 mAH and above are strongly recommended), the low-battery warning indicator does start flashing too soon, when the camera gets warm.<br />However, I have found to my surprise that with the low-battery indicator persistently flashing, this camera still allowed me to take approx. another 120 continuous shots, around 80 of which had used flash.  This means that while rechargeable battery life is actually ok for the camera, the low-battery warning is way too premature to be relied upon.<br />While this camera also lacks other features found on the more expensive Canon and requires the newer, smaller (and more expensive) xD memory card, it is very much more pocketable, and has a new hidden Ace - the 'Super Macro Mode' hidden in the Menu option, which allows fantastic close-up photos from under 1 inch (2 cm) away, compared to the Canons and Nikons which can only go as close as 2 inches (4-5 cm) max only.<br />Overall, this camera takes very colorful, contrasty, razor-sharp pictures, and pictures taken with the flash were also well exposed.  I have noticed that the latter are definitely brighter than those taken with competing Nikons, such as the Coolpix 2100/3100 & newer 2200/3200 range, which seem to suffer from slightly underpowered flash and remain unrectified by the manufacturer until this very day.<br />VERDICT: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - despite the premature low-battery indicator, the camera delivers one of the very best picture quality in its price category, with a new hidden bonus (Super Macro Mode!).  This is my very first review ever at Amazon.com, and I hope this short review has helped.","Compact, simple to use camera. For the price it comes packed with features - easy transfer of pics to PC using USB cable. Excellent picture quality when used at best Pixel setting - 20 pics with original 16MB XD memory card. Not used the movie mode - own a camcorder. I invested in a rechargeable Li-Ion CR-V3 battery pack (yes! now available as rechargeables), much better life/performance than even the higest rated rechargeable NiMH - not very expensive given its performance, available on Amazon for $31 (I bought my Li-Ion battery pack from Buy.com at $29.50).","Although I've access to assorted digital cameras,a need for super close up work in electronics had left me frustrated, since most modern units max out at a handspan (~200mm. Grr !! BUT - this new Olympus C-310 (as it's sold here in NZ) fits the budget bill well, since it goes to just 20mm (~1 inch). Yah - see sample pix (itself resized to ~100k from original 600k)=> [...]<br />* Top features - supermacro, 2 AA NiMH, large LCD<br />* Downsides - rather chunky styling, no sound with movies<br /> Of course all the \"normal\" Olympus features & user friendly software is included.

Today's cameras have evolved even more with features. I still use this camera for intermittent settings with family and friends and it works really well. I really like using this camera over other cameras because you have more control over its features and it’s not as advance as cameras now. I can use this camera with Adobe programs, Windows programs, and Dropbox and its really easy. Also, this is a ok starting camera if you want to get into a photography business since you can do a lot of editing through the different programs.","We've had this little Digi for eight years now.

The only problem is we got about 24 pictures out of a set of batteries and they were done.  We only kept the camera for about 3 months because of that.  It was just to much of a hassle.  We may have had better luck with more expensive batteries but after a year of buying them we could have just bought a camera with a rechargeable battery.","This was my second digital camera and while it was good for the first year, after that it began locking up. I would take a picture and the camera would freeze and I would have to shut it off and try again. I lost many good shots because of this and it led to me buying a new camera.","Has been wonderful, especially before smart phones became so ubiquitous.","Great for the price.","replaced an old camera","It arrived on time and everything worked and it looked almost like a new camera.  A very good camera.  I will be taking a lot of pictures with this camera.","When I first bought this camera 5 years ago this was a top of the line camera. Today's cameras have evolved even more with features. I still use this camera for intermittent settings with family and friends and it works really well. I really like using this camera over other cameras because you have more control over its features and it’s not as advance as cameras now. I can use this camera with Adobe programs, Windows programs, and Dropbox and its really easy. Also, this is a ok starting camera if you want to get into a photography business since you can do a lot of editing through the different programs.","We've had this little Digi for eight years now.  It's dinged up, scuffed, and still works like a champ.  It was an impulse buy for us on our way to a beach, and didn't feel like bringing our more sophisticated photo gear with us.<br /><br />Did we expect incredible photos?  No, not at 4mpx, but the pics are plenty good enough for our website and keeping friends in touch with our activities.

I also found you need to use name-brand alkaline batteries if you want to take more than one or two pictures at a time; see my review for AA Alkaline Battery Value Pack.  Also, the battery charge indicator is basically useless regardless of the type of battery; it tells you if you have enough battery for few shots.  No semblance to a gas gauge; more like an out-of-gas indicator light.  I do get a lot of pictures out of the CR-V3 lithium batteries.  And I can play around with the zoom a lot with the lithium ones; with alkaline, zoom a few times, and you may need to wait for them to rebound to take a picture!<br /><br />Sometimes I get great pictures, and other times it seems the auto-focus sensor seems to be confused and locks in on the wrong part of the image.  The latency from pushing the shutter button to the camera capturing the image is frustrating long; especially using the flash.  Pushing the shutter button down part-way helps somewhat.","PROS: Ive had my Olympus D-580 for about four years, and I have finally decided to upgrade.  I have to admit that for what I paid (around $250) it has been a great little camera with a lot of features.  My most-enjoyed feature had to be the video, which has zoom feature.  I took my first video at Niagara Falls and was astonished at the quality of the picture and sound, even when at max zoom.  Since then I have taken countless videos of my children, and aside from needing a lot of lighting (outdoors is best) I have no complaints.<br /><br />I like the fact that it uses AA rechargeables, and it isnt a big battery burner.  I could take about 250-400 photos, depending on size, before needing to change the batteries.  Carrying a spare set solves any worry about running out.  And, if you forget your spares, you can always buy a pack of AAs in an emergency.  I say this is a bonus because the lithium ion batteries dont offer such convenience.  The night scene also performs remarkably well, if a bit grainy.<br /><br />My main reasons for the upgrade, and the reasons this camera gets 4 stars instead of 5, are the following CONS:<br /><br />* Very slow picture-taking.  It can take up to three seconds from click to capture, which is just completely unacceptable to me.  In fact, I would rate that part of the camera a 1 star because it has caused me to lose SO many great shots.  By the time the thing gets around to capturing the photo, my scene was gone.<br /><br />*Auto-focus can be sticky.  Sometimes the three-second delay becomes a permanent one when the auto-focus seemed to get stuck mid-thought and the camera just didnt take the photo at all.  Adjustments to scene would probably help a bit, but honestly, it didnt help me much.<br /><br />*You have to hold PERFECTLY still to get a nice, clean shot.  Thankfully it's digital so I could toss the many blurred pictures I had throughout the past few years.  This problem seems to have worsened has the camera has gotten more use.<br /><br />*Unexplained grainy pictures. Sometimes, without any apparent reason, the camera will take a few really grainy photos.<br /><br />*Lens is prone to spots, and boy will those ruin some great photos.  This is easily remedied, just keep a good lens cleaner on hand and always check your lens before taking photos.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend the Olympus D-580 to anyone looking to go digital.  The 4MP offer surprising clarity and beautiful, bright photos.  It's a great family camera (aside from being slow to capture, which people trying to photograph small children may find very frustrating) and performs well in a variety of lighting situations.  It's nice and small, lightweight, but not so small and lightweight that you're half afraid of losing the thing.<br /><br />The reason I am upgrading at this point is that I am more into photography as art in addition to wanting the great photos this camera can offer.  I'm a feature creature!  I will definitely be keeping my Olympus D-580 for a backup though, it's been a great little camera.","By  Kathy \"kainesis2\" (NJ USA) - See all my reviews<br /><br />It's about 3 years old now and I have never had one whit of trouble with it. My 6 year old granddaughter has been taking pictures with it also, since she was 3 and she has become quite the photographer (though she's dropped the camera from time to time and it survives!). The pictures are always crisp and clear, with great color. Sometimes there's red-eye with flash photos which is normal, and I can easily take care of with Picasa. Family members have other more expensive digital cameras, but mine (around $250 at the time) takes the best photos, in my opinion. I have been extremely happy with this camera.","The camera takes nice pictures but even with rechargeable batteries, they have to be replaced after about 20-25 pictures, maybe more depending on how often you open and close the camera.  I always have to have extra batteries charged and with me because we never make it through an event without having to replace the batteries at least once, ofter more.  Also, there is a long delay between pressing the shutter button and the actual taking of the picture.  I have missed so may shots because of this!","This was my first digital camera & I am so happy I bought it.  I have had it for two years & have taken several hundred photo's if not over a thousand with much satisfaction (I also get alot of compliments on my pictures). I am a scrapbooker & I take this camera with me wherever I go....it stays in my fanny pack unless I'm using it.  I do not use the software that came with it as I already had Google's Picassa2 & was happy with that.  I see many complaints have been made that this camera eats batteries.  I buy Walgreen brand photo batteries & they last a long time.  I will probably upgrade to a new camera this year but I will most likely buy another Olympus camera I think.","I had this camera for about 2 years and I truly enjoyed using it. Great outdoor and indoor pictures. I was especially impressed with the indoor pictures as not that many cameras I owned or tried were able to take great bright pictures indoors. Beautiful, rich colors and very sharp images - it was hard to take a bad picture. It did use alot of batteries, but Rechargeable CR-V3 Li-ion batteries would make a great difference. The only problem was the sliding lens' cover that I think was the reason why my camera broke down. Or may be the batteries were running out of charge - but all over sudden it started bipping, the lens wouldn't come out and then the power would go off. I'm still giving it 5 stars because I was very happy with it and would recommend it to everyone.","I bought a D580 because I had an earlier model Olympus digital camera that was OK and I thought that an upgrade would be an improvement. Picture quality was great with the 580, but hard to get what you shoot because of the l  o  n  g  shutter lag and the  l  o  n  g  start up time, I really grew to HATE the cute little camera for those two reasons. I was using high mAh NIMH rechargeable batteries and had no complaint about battery life at all, just missed a lot of shots because the thing wasn't ready or because of the shutter lag. It does have a happy ending, on a boating trip in the Gulf of Mexico, I bumped the rail and the case with a velcro belt loop came loose and it got dumped in the Gulf, good riddance. I promptly bought a Fuji because it uses AA batteries and the other XD memory cards that I had, I'm now a happy camper.","Whatever anyone says, the battery is zapped by this little handy camera.  If you like to take plenty of pix, be ready to shell out for the batteries.<br /><br />The pictures are great, easily handlable camera. Love everything about it. but the battery life.<br /><br />I've tried the lithiums, i have recharagables, but they all get wiped out by the powerusage on this machine.","I bought this camera about a year ago, as my first digital camera. I love photography as a hobby, and this camera takes beautiful pictures. I often get asked if I am a professional photographer. I recently upgraded, but love this camera so much, I stayed with the Olympus brand. I still plan on using this camera often.<br /><br />Only con: It is a battery hog, but you can fix that by getting rechargeable batteries, or the Energizer e2 lithium batteries.<br /><br />*Update 2008* Just updating that I still use this handy little camera, and it is still working like new for me. Fits great in a purse to carry with you all the time if you never want to miss a shot.","This is a great camera.  Inexpensive, lightweight, and very versatil.  It takes great pictures.  The only downside to this camera is the delay when you snap a picture.  I took a picture as someone was walking out the door and after the delay all i had was the door.  The batteries are long life, took pictures all day on one battery.","The instructions were not congruent to the actual camera settings.  However, after just a few minutes, I had it figured out.  This camera is BY FAR easier to use than the D-510 that it replaced.  As per the \"beef\" about battery life, that I have read: What is the difference if you change two batteries every 20 or so shots or four batteries every forty shots? Thus far, I am very pleased with this camera.","Honestly, I don't know why people are complaining about this camera. It is a simply designed snapshot camera that offers great resolution at an extremely affordable price!<br /><br />What more could you ask for<br /><br />4.0 MP<br /><br />3x Optical, 4x Digital Zoom<br /><br />larger LCD screen<br /><br />Weight: 5.8 oz<br /><br />PRICE: just over $100!<br /><br />I cannot believe you have anything to complain about<br /><br />simply a great camera, and I have tried them all","Several of these reviews sound like they are talking about a different camera than the one I'm using. Or they didn't read the manual and don't know how to use it. I've only had my D-580 a few weeks but couldn't be more pleased. It's compact and stylish and has Olympus's trademark sliding lens cover to protect the lens.<br /><br />The sliding lens cover does seem a bit stiff, but so does the one on my Stylus 35mm camera. I've been using that for 5 years and it still works just fine. The thing you have to remember, and they tell you about it in the manual, is to close the lens cover in 2 stages. You slide it part way to the detent, the lens retracts, and then you can close it the rest of the way. I like the sliding lens cover.<br /><br />The D-580 has 4MP resolution with 4 settings: SHQ, 2288 X 1712; HQ (the default setting), also 2288 x 1712, but more compressed; SQ1, 1600 x 1200; and SQ2, 640 x 480. The included 16MB xD card will hold up to 19 pictures in HQ. In SHQ, it will hold only 6. Obviously, you will want a larger card. They're available all the way up to 1GB. Using Olympus cards and the Camedia software, you can stitch together panoramas from as many as ten images.<br /><br />It has several modes accessible through the menu: Program Auto, Portrait, Landscape, Portrait-Landscape, Night Scene, Self Portrait, and Movie. Most of the time you'll get the best results by using Program Auto, the default setting, and letting the camera do the thinking.<br /><br />The easily accessible macro setting (there's a separate button for that) allows you to to take pictures from as close as 7 cm. The macro pictures look great and I've been using the macro more and more. And you can use the zoom in macro, allowing great flexibility. Apparently the zoom is disabled in super macro mode, which is accessible through the menu.<br /><br />Speaking of zoom, it has a smooth 3x optical zoom, and 4x digital. Thankfully, the digital zoom has to be turned on whenever you want to use it. I don't ever see a need to use it, since with 4MP to work with, most of the time you can just crop the picture and still end up with resolution to spare and much better results.<br /><br />The numbering system used for pictures is P + month + day + number of the picture for that day's shooting: e.g. P6070001, for June 7, 2005, picture number 1 (the year doesn't appear in the file name, but is recorded). That ensures a unique filename for each picture. One little quirk is that the date resets to January 1, 2004 if the batteries are taken out for 3 days. Not a problem, just something to be aware of. Resetting the date is pretty easy.<br /><br />The included Camedia software seems fairly useful, especially if you want to do panoramas, but since it mostly duplicates software I  already have, I didn't install it.<br /><br />Picture downloading on the Mac is simple, and you don't even have to turn this camera on. When the USB cable is plugged in, the LCD lights up and gives you three choices, the first one of which is PC (the others are Print and Exit). You just click the OK button and iPhoto launches. The camera shows up in the finder as a drive, so it must be ejected before you can unplug it. Unplugging it without first ejecting it triggers an error message.<br /><br />It is powered by 2 AA batteries, and while power consumption is heavy, it isn't quite as heavy I expected. I used the supplied alkaline AAs for about a week before they gave up the ghost. Then I switched to rechargeable NiMH batteries, and it did much, much better. I use the Monster Cable MB 4-DCRC, sold by Amazon. I prefer cameras that use AA batteries over cameras that use proprietary lithium ion batteries because AAs are cheap and available and in a pinch you can drop in some alkalines.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with the D-580. Picture quality is consistently great with Olympus's new image processor (TruePic Turbo), and it has enough settings to fiddle with to keep a person amused for hours. Not that you have to -- on Program Auto, it does everything for you and does it very well. I highly recommend this camera for the amateur who likes uncomplicated cameras, but occasionally likes to dabble in creative photography.","I expected a good camera when getting this model due to prior experience with the Olympus digital line.  This camera is wonderful!  The comparable Stylus had a few more features, but I'm very happy to save a few $ in buying this one on sale.  Video quality is good.  Night photos are surprisingly good for the specs.  Macro shots are amazing.  I bought the camera just in time for the California desert bloom & an Hawaii trip.  On video of a cheetah running by 2-ft from me, you can hear its paws beating the ground.  The photos are unbelievable - even with hyper, shaky hands.  People rave about my photos.  The camera's performance offsets my shortcomings as a photographer.","I used to always borrow my dad's C-5000 (I think that's the model... now I can't remember!), so my parents decided to buy me my own camera for Christmas. My mum picked this one for me, and I think she made a pretty good choice. The camera is very easy to use. At first it may seem intimidating to have to flip through the digital menus to change settings, but it quickly becomes second nature.<br /><br />All of the pictures that I have taken using just the point-and-shoot method have come out very well. The flash is sometimes over-powering, but for the most part it does its job well. Pictures taken in the auto mode are generally very crisp, unless I turn the flash off anywhere other than outdoors (in which case the shutter speed is longer and my hands shake too much to get a clear picture.. I also have this problem in night mode).<br /><br />I love this camera because it makes playing with different settings -- flash, white balance, macro mode -- very easy. It's much, much easier than the C-5000. It's a very good camera for anyone who wants to dabble in photography but it's ready to drop the money for something more serious. And it's also a great little point-and-shoot camera.<br /><br />Of course, a big complaint is the batteries. Don't even think about using regular AAs. I found an Olympus package at Best Buy for about $30 that solved my problem... It included two sets of rechargable batteries with charger, a camera case, and a (very) mini-tripod. With regular batteries, I think I took about 20 pictures, but I can take many more with the NiMH batteries the package included.<br /><br />Another thing -- don't bother with Camedia software! We have it on my parents' computer, and it's a hassle! If you have Windows XP, bypass Camedia and use the default XP programs, they're much better!<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a wonderful starter camera, and have been very pleased with it. I'll drop the money on something more sophisticated when my photography skills get better, but in the meantime I'm a happy girl. Even if you just want this camera for point-and-shoot purposes, I advise that you play around with the different settings (I like to practice on my dogs, so I'll know what I'm doing when I have to take real pictures) -- they can improve your pictures greatly!","I bought this camera a month ago and use AA NiMh batteries that I recharge.  They last for a long time, in fact I have never run the batteries down on a photo shoot.  I do have to turn the flash off on several occassions when it really is unnecessary.  The photos come out great and all the user interfaces are easy to use. The down loads to my pc are fast and easy too.  For the price, this is a great buy for a digital camera.","We got this camera for a good price from Costco, and we're pretty happy with the pictures we're getting. Like most people would, we moved the files to our hard drive using the software that came with the camera: Camedia Master. The program freezes up on me frequently, but that isn't my beef. In order to e-mail the photos you take, to move them to a disk to get them processed, to move them back to your camera, really to do anything except print them or use them as wallpaper, you have to pay for the 'pro' version, which costs $20. By the time most consumers discover this and start using another program to upload their photos, they will, as we have, already put dozens of photos in this program where they will be irretrievably locked until they pony up $20 they hadn't bargained on when they bought the camera. This kind of business practice is really underhanded, because it makes basic functionality a premium product. Buy the camera, by all means, but don't use the software at all, or budget into the endeavor an extra $20 to do the very minimum you'd want to do with digital photos.","This is a great little point & shoot camera. I paid $199 at Costco.<br /><br />It take really nice pictures and is VERY easy to use. The only downside is it's slow to focus in low light.<br /><br />I keep the flash off and the LCD off to save batteries.<br /><br />It's a great first digital or travel camera.","I received this camera as a Christmas present from my wife.  I think this is a really nice digital camera.  It's very easy to use and takes terrific photographs.  I've read the reviews on this page about the camera being a battery eater.  In fact, it exhausted the batteries that were included with the camera in less than 15 photographs.  That got me nervous and I was ready to return the camera.  But my wife also got me a nimh battery recharger which made all the difference in the world.  These rechargeable batteries last significantly longer than the alkaline batteries.  I would recommend this camera.  It's inexpensive and a great starter digital camera.","i got this camera for Christmas and i love it because it is very easy to use and to hook it up to the computer is soo easy.","I upgraded from a D-510. The D-580 Consumes batteries too quickly - need to carry several backups, and use rechargeable batteries.  I wish it held 4 AA batteries like the 510, rather than 2.<br />In all other respects it is a great camera for the money.<br /><br />Pocket-sized, simple to use, the D-580 makes digital photography easy for anyone.<br />4 mega pixels , 3x optical/4x digital zoom, auto focus only, program exposure only, JPEG file format, ISO range 50-400, movie mode with sound.<br />The movie option is good fun, but nothing like a VHS. I use this for e-mailing short clips to friends. 160 x120 pixel mode uses about 75kByte/sec, maybe 5% less in a zip file. High resolution uses about 340Kbyte/sec - unusable unless you have the 64MByte-memory card.  Sound quality not bad.<br />The shutter speed is noticeably faster than the D510, there is a delay of about 1/5 second between pressing the button and taking the picture. So it is still slower than a 35mm camera, making moving action shots a challenge.  But this is true of all digital cameras, and the D580 seems the best in its price range.<br />The USB connection is very fast and easy to use - Windows treats the camera like an extra hard drive.<br />I am pleased with this purchase.","I bought the Olympus D-580 as a birthday gift for my wife and as our initial foray into the world of digital photography. The D-580 is certainly easy enough to use and the picture quality is very good. I've made some 8x10 prints from the D-580 that look great. The controls are all very intuitive and user-friendly: you basically scroll through options on the on-screen menu. Transferring pix to your PC is a snap. With Windows XP, I just connected the camera to my pc via the included USB cable and I was ready to go - no need to even use the included software.<br /><br />A few negatives I noticed pretty quickly:<br /><br />1) the D-580 will demolish your AA batteries within about 20 pictures (combination of flash/no flash). After the first set of AAs quickly died, we switched to the CRV3 Lithium battery pack and got much better battery performance (or, invest in some rechargables...)<br /><br />2) the auto-focus is hit and miss in dimly-lit situations, due to the lack of an AF illuminator. (This has me looking at the C-7000, but that's another story.) So, if you take a lot of indoor photos (party pix, etc), the D-580 may not cut it for you. It's hard to tell whether photos are sharply focused until they've been transferred to the computer, which has been frustrating for us and the reason I didn't give this camera another star or two...<br /><br />All in all, though, I'd recommend the D-580 to anyone looking for a first digital camera or even just a simple-to-use point-and-shoot camera without a lot of bells and whistles.","Pay extra for the Olympus 410 because this is a battery sucker. Would you rather be walking around with a bag full of batteries? I had to constantly change the batteries. That was when I decided this camera wasn't worth it. It becomes a hassle when you have to change the batteries after 30 or so pictures.  I have to admit the picture quality is better than the 410 but the fact that it doesn't come with rechargeable batteries made me return the item. In the long run this camera would be too expensive to keep because batteries are expensive and having 3 or 4 sets of extra rechargeable batteries becomes a hassle. I found it rather troublesome having to change batteries after a few pictures.  Never again will I buy a camera without the rechargeable lithium-ion battery technology. Overall the camera takes almost perfect pictures because the lag time is not noticeable. In fact I didn't even notice there was a lag time until I got the 410 to compare to. Another downside to this camera is that it is rather bulky and big compare to other digital cameras. I have small fingers and I found the buttons rather hard to press at times.<br /><br />This item only gets a 3 because there are more cons than pros. The only pro is the picture quality. But the AA batteries make it a  con in the long run.","My first digital camera was a Olympus D-390. It was great,but it was a fixed lens(no optical zoom). Then I tried a kodak cx6230 and really didn't care for it at all. I considerd the D-540 and  Stylus 410. My wife sort of borrowed it,and seems like it very much. She likes the auto program mode and the sharp picture quality. I use rechargeable batteries and always have a spare set charged and use the LCD monitor to much to tell you how many pictures I get out of a pair of batteries. I have had this camera for a couple of months and shot over two hundred pictures and have not been disappointed.","This camera is an excellent value!  It is very cheap for a four megapixel camera, has zoom, takes great, sharp, and colorful pictures!  I bought this camera for my girlfriend based on what I had read about ease of use for this camera.  You would be hard pressed to find a more user friendly camera in this price range or above.  THe auto focus on this camera is excellent!  We have taken lots of picures with this camera during the day and night and little have come out anything but clear and colorful.  Two of the night photos I took of fireworks came out blurry but this is to be expected when not using a tripod.  This is a great camera that has a very powerful flash and is easy to use.  A word of warning would be not to even try using Alkaline batteries, they will be spent in about 20 shots. One warning, for outdoor wildlife enthusiasts, the zoom motor on this camera is very loud! Instead get one of the Lithium CR-V3 batteries which give excellent picture taking volume in this camera.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for an easy to use, great working and low priced camera.","It is an excellent camera for this price (I bought it for $250 about 2 weeks ago). Last week I used it to take pictures in Niagara Falls during day and night. The pictures during the day are crisp. During the night, I held it by hand to take pictures of rapids and the water falls (without flash). The water flow effect was surpringly clear and bright.<br />Its TruePic Turbo image processor is indeed very fast. I used the camera to take pictures of fireworks. During 10 minutes I took tens of pictures.<br />However, it is quite necessary to have four recargable Ni-Mh AA batteries with this camera. It uses battery power pretty fast.","I purchased this camera for my wife because of it's ease of use (point'n'click) and the lense is automatically covered when turned off (protects lense in her purse or briefcase). It is a nice camera, easy to use, picture quality is OK (my daughter's Kodak 6340 and my Nikon 5700 pictures are much sharper), good camera for beginners. Batteries do not last long, pictures blurred with full digital zoom.","This is my second Olympus and I really like it.  Small and compact, takes great pictures.  Easy to understand instructions.  Great point and shoot camera.  I wish the lense cover and body were a bit stronger.  Lense cover seems a bit flimsy - like it may not last a long time without breaking.  But we will see.  I have only had it about a week.  I bought the Cannon A75 and hated it and took it back.  Olympus takes much better pictures and it much more amature user friendly. Cannon seems to be for the professional that knows how to manually set the settings.  But if you want a great little point and shoot camera  \"Cheaper\" than cannon,  then go with Olympus.  I think my next one will be the Olympus Stylus, since it is made for all weather and a all steel body.  I wish I had gotten the Stylus, but it is a bit more expensive.","I found this camera to be very easy to use right out of the box.  The software installation went off without a hitch and I was able to view the pictures on my PC with ease.  Anyone looking for a first-time digital camera would be very pleased with the package Olympus has put together here.  However, after only having had the camera for four days, the lens would no longer retract when I went to turn the camera off.  So now, the camera beeps and the indicator lights near the viewfinder constantly blink which if I read the manual correctly indicate some kind of battery problem (which it isn't).  I'm planning on exchanging it for another one and hopefully, this lens problem is just with the camera I have now.","This is my first digital camera.  I was looking for something that was easy to use, took excellent pictures, and wasn't too expensive.  After looking at Fujis, Kodaks, and Canons, I decided to go with this one.  Boy am I glad I did! The picture quality is excellent, it's really easy to use, and has enough options for a beginner without going overboard.  Screens and options are easy to navigate through; you can start using this camera in no time.  There were no problems getting my computer to recognize the camera.  The only compliant is there were some minor problems with the installation software for the included photo editing software.  The installation program thought the serial number wasn't correct even though it was.  I just had to click the back button then reenter it again to get it to work.  Overall this is an excellent camera, especially for only $299.99.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great point and click 4.0 mega pixel camera.","Easy to use straight out of the box.  Great automatic features and has the option of manual.  Over 130 photos can be taken with a 128mb card, more than enough I think.  The good price makes it top in its class. Instructions are very clear and easy to understand.  The software that comes with it is easy to use.  Makes a great first digital camera, as it is mine."]},{"name":"Olympus Stylus 410","amazon_reviews":["Great Camera!","Purchased this used, but complete with all accessories, for an excellent price. This is my 3rd Stylus, the others were dropped, and it performs well, except that it takes about a minute to boot up. This can be very annoying when trying to take a quick shot. Probably why the previous owner sold it. It uses xD cards, which are becoming obsolete due to lack of memory space. My next camera will be a TG, which is shock resistant.","This was a 'good' camera when it first came out, and was the first digi cam we bought when we had our first child.  It takes good pictures and mediocre video.  It has a number of different picture settings, that seem to work alright, if not great.  This camera shines in a \"Point and Shoot\" function, as long as you don't mind it taking a second or two to shoot after you push the button.<br /><br />It's pretty long in the tooth now, but it's a great starter camera for any young kids (<10) you wanted to get started in the world of photagraphy without worrying about the cost of a broken camera WHEN they drop it.  As an added bonus, this camera is fairly tough and is water resistant.<br /><br />As an extra selling point to me, I still have my underwater housing for this, so I can take it SCUBA diving if I wanted to take pictures.","I purchased this from amazon in april 2004. It must have been lost. Over the last 3 months my son got maried, and I sat at the Kitchen table and I noticed a familar camera case. I asked whose it was and my teen agers said \"It's yours DaD!\" They found it in my now married son room. I was Perplexed. It was all there. The camera, xd card, charger, rechargabled battery. So I charged it up and it is back in service again. It is sturdy, takes great photos, I know it is only 4 megapexils but I do not care. Brand new condition. I have a vague memory of useing it, but when I looked it up they where going for near $200.00. Over all a great deal. Oh the really funny part. It had photos of mt now teenagers building a igloo in the winter. Thanks to Amazon and Olypus!","This camera has been my travel buddy for three years now, and we've taken quite a few amazing photos. Its been especially good at giving me crisp black-and-white pictures despite the (now) low resolution. With some common sense (turning off the flash when it isn't needed, using a tripod for night scenes) and actual reading of the online instructions (using the macro setting for close-up texture), one can take great photos within the zoom and pixel limitations. Unfortunately, this lil' guy won't read a SD card larger than 128 megs, which are a bit pricey considering the cost of a new model camera. So, if you have some older SD cards to use, go for it! It'll be a great bargain for a camera to tote around in your backpack and bash about.","This camera takes great pictures and has enough options for the casual photographer.  They only feature I don't like is the lens extend and retract by the opening and closing of the lens cover.  Other than that, it is great and a tough little camera.  I would certainly recommend it.","Great little camera, got it to replace a 400 model that recently quit on me.  It fits great in the underwater housing and i absolutely love it!","i have had this camera for over 6 years and it still works wonderfully.  i am no professional photographer, but the pictures i take are good for sharing with other people.  i have printed some of them out and they are good quality.  the only issue i have with this camera is taking pictures at night.  its really hard toget a picture that isn't blurry.","Great Camera!","Purchased this used, but complete with all accessories, for an excellent price.

I gave it 4 stars only because it is an older camera with lower megapixels by today's standards; but even so, it's big on features, and it can take some fabulous pictures.<br /><br />This camera is very hardy and rugged, light and very compact, yet if feels solid in your hands. I keep it with me all the time, throwing it in my purse to take it down the street or across the country. It is dinged up, scratched, and slightly dented, but it just keeps going. Living in the Sacramento valley, I have also subjected it to some fairly extreme conditions -- from Tahoe snow to over 100 degrees F in the summer. It even fell in the water on a boating trip, and it's still going strong.<br /><br />I chose this camera because of its many features. I especially wanted the option for video with sound, and originally thought I'd only be taking snapshots of people with it. However, this camera can do so much more. It has several condition settings, such as Beach+Snow for bright sun, Landscape, Landscape+Portrait, Portrait, Indoors, and even a Cuisine setting for food! I've also had fun with the Macro and Super Macro settings. For the ambitious and creative, you can vary the White Balance and Exposure Value for indoors, outdoors, and different lighting conditions. It also has a Stitch Panorama setting (for taking multiple photos of a wide or tall scene and stitching them together with Olympus software), and you can record sound with a picture. It will also shoot multiple frames at about 3 fps. The zoom range on it is decent -- you can take pix of landscapes yet still get rather close for action.<br /><br />After two years, I have pretty much maxed out this camera's abilities and will be upgrading to the Canon EOS 40D. But I would definitely recommend this camera to a friend, and I'd buy it again for its price, features, and overall quality.","This is a beautiful looking camera. It is a very comfortable camera and fits easily into the palm of your hand. It slips into a pocket for easy carry and you can drop it and it still works. I've dropped mine several times. It's also water resistant.<br /><br />If you want a rugged camera that takes good pictures and don't need manual settings this is a bargain for today's prices. I bought one<br />when they first came out and paid a lot more.<br /><br />I also have the telephoto and wide angle lenses which are held on with magnet rings.<br /><br />Don't care much for the CamedaMaster software and don't even use it.<br />You have to pay extra to activate some features. Also would prefer the entire manual in print and not on disk. The menu takes awhile to learn. Use the no reset feature to save your settings.<br /><br />Hope that helps. For today's prices this is a good deal for a camera that you can<br />just take with you anywhere.<br /><br />Update: 3/7/11 It's 3.5 years since I wrote the review and I'll just say that this was my first digital camera and I've had many cameras since but I'll always keep this one.<br />Michelle Ress","This tiny jewel of a camera is a snap to use, fits easily in one's pocket, and is surprisingly sturdy (with its solid construction, automatic lens cover, and all-weather rating).  We've taken many great pictures with it, including all those we'd have missed because toting our big SLRs was either too inconvenient or not an option.  Our Stylus 410 stays with us whereever we go --- because we've found that it's so much easier to take a picture if you have a camera at hand.  We've very much enjoyed our Stylus 410 and heartily recommend carrying one.","I purchased this camera at Costco after doing some extensive research.  I have had it for just under two years, and the flash has died.  Since its out of warranty I would have to pay the repair, which is almost the cost of the camera.  Its been a good camera, good picture quality, reliable, but I have had the same issue as other reviewers.  If you bump the sliding cover while shooting a pic, the camera goes off.  You have to wait until the battery is totally dead to recharge it.  To erase a picture you have to go through an insane menu, and its soooo slow to go through and manually delete things, you might as well do it on your computer.  But, it was faithful to me, and took good pictures for my scrapbooking.  If you can reconcile spending $200 for a camera every two years or so, then its acceptable.","I have had this camera for 2 years and it is a HUGE improvement from my big Sony Mavica.  However, after camera shopping for a few weeks, I have noticed the things that frustrate me about the camera.  The slide to turn it on was great and neat- at first.  When you hold the camera to take a pic, if it just touches the slide, it turns the camera off and you have to restart the thing all over again.  It seems to always happen when I ask other people to take pics with it.<br /><br />Also, the pics are nice and enlarge well, but if it is low light, the pics are orange and blurry- even with the flash and night setting turned on.<br /><br />I loved the weater resistant feature, though and I have dropped it more than once and it fires back to life each time.  The battery seems to last forever.","I bought this camera from Best Buy in October 2004, took it to Iraq with me and it worked beautifully.  I thought the sand storms or the heat might get the best of it so I bought an extended warranty.  Haven't needed to use it yet.  The only drawback is the fact that it can only take 20 second videos.  Besides that, this is a great camera.","THIS CAMERA IS GREAT, TAKES A LITTLE BIT TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE SETTINGS, GREAT PICTURES","..but has some drawbacks. One is that it's too easy inadvertantly to open the aku cover while holding the camera for a snapshot. Photo quality is very good, can enlarge to 8\"x10\", but not as good as the C 300, which is no longer produced (the C 300 is the cat's meow). The successor is the C55 in Europe, the C5500 in the U.S. The 410 is smaller than the C 300, water tight and very light, good for long distance hiking, is light because it uses an akku rather than 4 standard heavy batteries. If you're not concerned with weight and watertightness, buy the C 55. I find the 410 a bit too small to hold comfortably, it's about the same size as our Olympus all weather mu-II film camera, but one has a better grip on the latter. With the Olympus quality (I'm told they bought Leica's lenses), film is out unless you want to make slides.","This is truly a great camera to own.<br /><br />I'm not gonna say much, take a look and see<br /><br />for yourself. [...]<br /><br />You will have to be patient though as most of the pics are high resolution (1024x768)the link takes an aweful lot of time to open up .","This is my first digital camera, and Iv'e had it for 9 months, and I love it.  It takes awesome pictures, flowers and closeups look like there are right there, the colors are wonderful.  Scenery pictures are usually awesome, just make sure it is bright, if it is slightly dark, most likely the picture will come out blurry, which is one of my few complaints.  It doesn't take very good night pictures, which is no big deal.  So far it has been waterproof, and I have gotten it slightly wet in creeks when hiking, and it hasn't bothered it.  Also, this is one tough little camera.  I have dropped it on gravel roads and when hiking, and there were no little drops.  The farthest I have ever dropped it has been about 4 feet, and it scratched it, but it still works just fine.  The only other complaint is that it has a small zoom.  If you don't might that, this is a great camera.  Overall, this is a great little camera.","I'm a whitewater canoeist and I bought this camera to take with me in the boat because it's water-resistant and I could use it with wet neoprene gloves on. I keep it in a dry box while running rapids, take it out to take photos or movies of other people running the same rapid. Issue number one is photo quality. It's not near as good as my Canon Powershot A80. With the Canon, I can use my software to zoom in much more on shots before the image gets pixelized. (Both are 4 megapixel cameras.) The Canon's focusing system also handles action shots much better, as well as low light conditions. Issue number two is that the battery door can easily be flicked open by an inadvertent finger movement. I was shooting a photo and grazed the door with my thumb and the battery dropped in my lap (fortunately not the water). Issue number 3, it is hard to set the mode for picture taking using the software and screen. They could have designed it to be easier to read in bright conditions. Overall, I'm not that happy with this camera and wish someone would invent a better water-resistant camera for rough outdoors use.","I bought this product last year and I have been using this camera so far. It is a good camera. You can bring it to anywhere because you can take your pictures in any conditions, snow, rain, waterfall. It is a nice metal made. This camera give you a crystal picture (only day time). but still have some problem when you take a picture at night because the flash that come with the camera is really small. it can't reach the object way far from it. however, it's not that bad. I like to take my picture in day time anyway. Simple and easy,,,if you want some thing handy...good quality picture (day time only) and inexpensive camera...Just Go For It.","I've been a heavy user of my camera since buying it in July, and it has proven to be a fantastic camera. It's light, it's rugged, it's survived rain storms, sandy beaches, banging against rocks as I've been hiking, etc.  Having a rechargable lithuim battery saves a lot of money, and it's small size allows me to take it anywhere.<br /><br />My two problems with it are the slow slow start up time, sometimes you can't afford to wait ten seconds, the moment is gone.  Also it takes a while to switch from settings, about another ten seconds sometimes.<br /><br />Overall I definitly recommend this camera to anyone.","This camera is terrific because it takes excellent pictures yet is small enough to fit in a purse or keep in the car.  The movie feature has come in handy and I use it  instead of my movie camera to take short movies of my granddaughter because it is readily available.  It is quick to load the pics into the computer too.  I would recommend expanding the memory though.  Great camera.","I had been given this camera for work, and I really was very happy with the photos. They were clear and crisp and the camera was really easy to use. I took it everywhere, even to the beach and dropped it in the sand and it never had a problem. The remote control is great for group photos that you want to be in also. The only drawback was the fact that you have to close the lense cover in order to playback the photos you just took. Sort of a pain. But the battery lasts forever! I then got the 410 model which is supposed to be better. Well, they corrected the fact that you have to close the lens cover to see the photos, but I hated that camera. It took terrible blurry photos, unless it was a sunny clear day outside and then you have to have the flash on at the same time. It also has this annoying sound that you can shut everything off except the fake shutter click sound. And the battery doesn't last very long. I returned it and am going to buy the 400 again for myself.","Most of the comments I have about this camera are positive.  Fast focus, quick shutter release, nice interface and sharp lens.  Great quality photos/color in good lighting.<br /><br />But there are two flaws that stand out:<br /><br />* The flash is incredibly weak.  Forget group shots or anything that's not 8' from you or in bright light.  It is just awful.<br /><br />* Slide-open cover prevents sticking it in your pocket with the strap on top.  Every time I stick this camera in my pocket it slides the lens cover off and the camera powers up in my pocket (lens extends, etc.)  Yes, I know I could simply turn the camera around so it'll power up when I pull it *out* but then the strap is on the wrong side.  Olympus... move the strap to the other side, or at least give us an option of where to mount the strap.<br /><br />I recommend the Canon A85 over this camera.  Yes it's bigger and not weatherproof, but it's 14' flash power is worth the sacrifice.","I bought this camera for a friend the same day I bought a Pentax Optio 5si for myself.  I'm now kicking myself for getting the Pentax.  We've taken pictures side by side with the same settings and this camera just takes better pictures.  The color is perfect.  When I compare my Pentax's pictures to ones from this camera, the Pentax ones look flat.  This camera feels really well made as well.  It's weather proof, easy to use, small, comes with rechargeable battery and cradle charger.  You can't really ask for more.  Highly recommended!","I read leel1's review about this camera, and decided to follow all of the advice, including the Lowepro 8m camera bag.  All of the advice was right on!  Even with my big hands, the camera is a snap to use, and the pictures turned out great.  Follow leel1's advice, and you can't go wrong!","I would have to say this is one of the best purchases I've made this year. I bring this camera everywhere. Its not as easy to use as the Olympus D-580 4MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom but its better in the sense that battery is rechargeable. I returned the Olympus D-580 because it was using up too many batteries. I had to switch batteries after 30 or so shots. But the picture quality at night doesn't measure to that of the D-580. I would have given this camera a 5 star if the picture quality was comparable to the cheaper D-580. But other than that I love everything about the camera. Its fun and cheap for a college student like myself who likes taking random pictures.<br /><br />As for the time delay, well that's when the camera is focusing. I do have a problem with it as well but its not as noticeable as some have made it out to be. You just have to hold and freeze for a little while.  At times this can be bothersome but for the price what can you say?? I don't mind saving money on this feature because I'm not using this camera to take pictures of little children or fast moving animals.<br /><br />Indoor pictures are terrible- even with the correct setting indoor pictures do not measure up to those taken with the D-580. I find that with indoor pictures, one gets the best pictures if it is totally dark but if there is lighting then the picture comes out darker. The best pictures I've been able to take with this camera were those taken outside. In June I took a picture outside and I was able to blow the picture up to a big 20 X 30 poster and it came out beautiful. I've blown up many poster size pictures but I've had the best result with the Olympus 410.<br /><br />I've used this camera to take pictures of documents as well. Sometimes professors post answers to exams on the walls and whenever I didn't feel like copying down the answers I just took a picture of the documents and I was able to read the words when I uploaded the pictures onto my computer. The things you can do with this camera is endless. Having a digital camera is very handy. If you take it to lab, you can take pictures of the organ being studied and then review it for your next lab. Its very handy.<br /><br />Overall I would have to say I love having this camera. I was able to do many things with little effort. for the price this camera is a bargain. Even if I had the extra money I don't think I would get a bulkier camera for better quality pictures. I like the size and the look of the camera. If you are unsure take a look at the camera around town before you purchase.","This unit is very stylish looking, and well built.  It won't be bothered by a little rain or snow, or the splash of a dolphin.  I am impressed with how well this little camera is put together, with a solid metal case, yet still very compact and light-weight.  The controls are logical and simple to use.  I'm not a big fan of proprietary batteries (you cannot just toss in a pair of Duracells in a pinch), but it seems necessary to achieve this compact size.  This camera would be perfect for a lady who wants to keep in her purse, glove box, briefcase, etc., to be handy for all occasions.  It is not a camera for the serious photographer though.  Picture quality is generally very good, but clearly not as good as the Olympus C-770 for example.  The image can be a little noisy in low light, for example on cloudy days, grass will lack sharpness and end up looking like a big mass of green.  The flash is on the weak side too (good for 12 feet at best), and you cannot add a more powerful one.  The 32MB memory card is adequate only if you reduce capture mode to say 1.2 MP size (1280 x 960), otherwise you'll want a bigger card.  The Stylus is made for someone who just wants to point and shoot with good results, which means it's perfect for some people, but I would only consider it as a second camera to have the go-anywhere portability, or backup camera for a more serious amateur photographer.  (All pros carry a back-up).  I'll give it four stars out of five, but depending on your needs it could be five stars or three.","this camera rocks, if you want something to just take to a party or a bbq, or just a night out on the town, this camera does the trick, i love it!","I shopped around for at least a month trying to find a good balance between price and megapixels, and memory card compatability. After the long search, i finally picked this camara up. To be 100% completely honest, i wouldnt have bought any other camara. I take this camara everywhere with me. I have had no problems whatsoever. Its easy to figure out how to use, and the pictures it takes are gorgeous. It uses a standard SD memory card, which are also fairly inexpensive. As for the picture delay that others complain about, its not even a problem for me...meaning ive never noticed it. Its super-macro setting allowes you to take super detailed close up shots that turn out great if you can hold still enough. Ive used it in the rain, at night...and take it camping with me and what not. Its super durable, too. Like ive said before, i wouldnt but another camara, because this is the perfect price-megapixel balance.","Ok, I see there have been some disgruntled users. This is an outstanding ultracompact AND weatherproof camera for the money! Tiny and fits in a woman's palm. I've carried it in my purse due to it's ultracompact size. As a longtime Canon and Nikon 35mm SLR user, the compact digital point and shoot cameras are not perfect. I really resisted going compact digital but carrying around a 35mm SLR can be weighty and inconvenient. Unless you wish to spend $999 or more, the 410 is a great stand-in. This camera takes superb pictures even in low light. All digital point and shoots will have some difficulty in low light conditions. This is why external flash units are available...even 35mm SLR's need addl lighting depending on shooting conditions! Yes, the flash is rather bright but with PC editing features this is easily remedied...better to have too bright a flash than weak flash. Remember nothing can be done regarding undercompensation. I did not find any significant delay time. Olympus designers also did a terrific job with the look and feel of Stylus 410. Show me a better looking camera on the market! The all-metal body and cover offer excellent protection. It weighs 5.8 oz. Just pick up a LowePro D-Res 8M weather resistant and fitted camera case ($12.75 at Amazon vendor Adorama Camera) and you are ready to go. This case is specially form-fitted for Olympus 410 and allows carry of (1) extra battery or memory card. Super small bag with shoulder strap. I have never owned an Olympus and did extensive research prior to purchase. I borrowed a friend's 300 Stylus and that is also a darned good camera for the money.<br /><br />If you are not a professional photographer and just need to take some vacation pics - this is a best buy. You should really not need more than 3-4 megapixels if you are taking 4x6 vacation pics as photo quality is very high. Even 5x7 photo quality is extremely good. Higher megapixels such as 6.0 will yield better looking 8x10's but how many of us really regularly shoot 8x10 photos? Otherwise, invest in a 35mm digital SLR (hint: Canon Digital Rebel - got one and love it!). Another good camera for the $ is Nikon Coolpix 3200 with 3.2 megapixels.","Have a 300 Stylus and tested a 410, will buy one soon.  Lots of myths out there:<br />- Never buy a camera that uses non-rechargeable batteries (i.e. AA).  You'll go through piles of them with even light usage.  They'll die just when you need more.  Why is it so hard to simply recharge your Li-ion battery more often than letting it run down to zero?<br />- I know it so hard to be inconvenienced, but you have to press the shutter down so the camera can focus.  If you're on a strange angle or poor lighting, the camera just won't take the shot - it's trying to focus during that time and conks out.  Anyone who wants \"instant\" shutter snaps needs to return to analog film.<br />- Skin tone is hard to get with any flash camera unless it's professional.  The Olympus flash does tend to be rather bright, I must admit.  But I'd rather have brighter (can adjust later with some editing software) than too dark (can't do anything.)<br />- Who wants all this extra bulky photo editing software?  I just want to plug the camera into my computer's USB slot and download the photos without all this baby-handholding \"editing software\" that comes with other cameras.  Only the Olympus allows you to do that.  If you're at someone's house or at work or wherever, you can download right to their computer.  Can't do it with others if they don't have the editing software CD.<br />Beats Fuji and Canon, this camera.","The Olympus Stylus 410 is great for my needs.  I use it for snapping photos around campus and on outdoor adventures.  The 410 takes quality photos outside, but inside is a different story.  When the light is good, and flash is not required, the photos come out very well.  When flash is required, people often complain about how bright it is--and how much more brighter it is than other cameras.  The flash also makes the photos turn out horribly, in some instances.<br />If you need a digital camera for outdoors/recreational use, the 410 should suit you well.  Not only does the camera take excellent outdoor photos, it also makes reds and blues more radiant.  I look forward to boating and canoeing this summer!  One suggestion:  buy a 128 or 256 MB card-you'll need it!","I've had my camera a bit over a year now, and I have come to know its good points and idiosyncrasies as well. I chose it because of the 4 megapixel quality and my prior use of its film cousin. I rate it four stars because it isn't a professional level camera- though it is very good for casual shooting and \"memory\" photos.<br />What I like: I love the compactness of this camera! This camera alives in a small carry-case with three spare batteries and a flat holder with three spare 1 MB xD cards, and some lens paper. (The TV and PC connecting cables, small charger and cord, with appropriate adapters, go in my carry-on stuff.)<br />I also love the dust- and water-resistance of this camera. In typical Stylus build, it has protective gaskets for every opening - and I have used this camera in gear-jamming dusty locations as well as very moist ones (Iguazú Falls, salt water small boat cruising.) It's taken very good scenics (including really nice sunsets) and people photos. It is fairly quick as long as I have pre-focused, and I am only taking one or two photos (always at high quality.) The software allows you to \"stitch\" several photos together for a panoramic view, and its convenient compactness feels good when I am visiting where tourists with flashy cameras are targets for thievery and muggery. When it is closed in its self-contained \"clamshell\", it fits discreetly in my pocket.<br />What don't I like? The menu system, if you want to use it to its maximum capability, can be exasperatingly counter-intuitive and arcane. The extensible lens, when extended to its maximum length, can be subject to distortion if you press against it.<br />This camera is NOT for anyone who needs telephoto (sports or wildlife? get a digicam with 10x OPTICAL zoom - NEVER use the \"digital zoom\" feature on any digital camera, disable it!) The screen can be difficult to see in bright conditions - use the viewfinder, disable the screen (which will also save battery energy,) realizing the photo will show a bit more than the finder will and leaving you a little cropping room.<br />It also can get expensive when you buy extra batteries and large-capacity proprietary xD cards, but then when I compare it with many rolls of film, processing and knowing what I have only when I'm back from the trip, not to mention reusinig the batteries and cards, you will save lots of money if you take lots of photos like I do.<br />Remember that even without a telephoto, camera motion is your enemy - practice breath control and squ-e-e-ze the shutter release, brace the camera - carry a folding table tripod, use a table, wall or chair as a base in low light conditions. I've got some unforgettable (and sharp!) sunsets, Eiffel Tower at night, etc. with my plastic folding angle-leg table tripod or pressing the camera against a lamppost, using this camera.<br />I scuba dive, and have even taken this camera to 125 - 130 feet in its Lexan housing and taken some reasonable underwater photos (you will want an aftermarket accessory strobe for decent color rendition if you go deeper than, say, thirty feet.)<br />For someone who travels and subjects cameras to varied environmental conditions, but wants a nice, compact, easy to use digital camera that will give you a decent 11 x 14 or under photo of people and scenics, I heartily recommend this camera.","The people that say that the delay do not know how to use a camera.  Usually, when I buy an expensive piece of equipment like this, I like to know how to use it.  There is only a negligible delay when taking pictures.  These people are just mashing the shutter button at the moment they want to take the picture.  This exactly what you are NOT supposed to do.  The delay they are getting is from the camera focusing.  What they should do is hold the button half way down, which focuses on the subject, then they just need to push it the rest of the way when the time is right.  They will then have a picture of exactly what they wanted.  Those reviews should be disregarded.","This camera is one of the greatest out there. Great Price too! The delay is not bad at all on the camera if you take the picture correctly. You need to focus it and then click and it will take the picture right away. I would tell everyone to get this great product.","This camera puts out some nice looking photos. But there is no perfect camera, so you have to decide what is most important to you. This is my third Olympus camera, I had a D490, a C750 and now a Stylus 410. I am now more of a Olympus fan than ever. Because Olympus gives me what is most important to me, sharp, clear photos with good color quality. They are slightly behind Nikon on skin tone. But ahead of most cameras companys when it coems to sharp, clear, photos with good rich color.<br />This is a small camera though, and it does not have all the features that it's big brother has. Of course, it would be pretty silly to use this camera for sports, so there really is no reason to put a sports mode on it. What it does best is get up close and personal and the stylus takes good photos of people. You could even get a fair photo of your house.<br />It is good enough for a small camera, but I am looking forward to Olympus coming out with the flat camera with the big screen on the back. I may well be the first one in line for the AZ-1 when it comes out in this country. In the mean time, my wife is happy with the little 410 stylus, so it should work out just fine for us. Just don't expect me to give up my C750 for this little guy. Unless I am at a party and I can get up close. When I am out photographing the iron workers building a bridge, I do not think the stylus will get the job done there.","I've used Olympus products for many years.  I have tried the 2 previous stylus digital cameras (300 & 400).  This new 410 is the best yet.  It's fast, accurate, easy to use.<br />The best digital camera I've ever had.<br />I would highly recommend it.  Use the different modes for any type of picture you want.  It does an excellent job!","I purchased the Digital Stylus 300 when it was released last summer.  Compared to other 3 and 4 megapixel cameras at that time, I thought that the 300 was very good.  My big complaint was the delay from the time that you press the button to take the picture to the time that the camera actually takes the picture.  I timed this delay and it is a full 2 seconds.  When I saw that the Digital Stylus 410 claimed to have a 30% faster processing time, I thought that I found a fix.  I just got the 410 and it still has the same delay.  In fact, if anything, it takes longer for the 410 to take a picture from the time that you push the button to the time that the camera actually takes the picture.  This is especially disappointing, not only because they market that they have improved this issue, but also because other manufactures have implemented new processors that actually do fix this delay problem.  Looks like the 410 is going back :-(<br />Other than this complaint, the 410 is generally a good camera.  That is why I gave it a 3.  However, given the advancements that others have made, it is hard to give the 410 any better rating."]},{"name":"Olympus C-8080 Wide Zoom","amazon_reviews":["This is a good beginners camera for someone just starting off or wanting to practice.

Takes beautiful vivid shots.  Lightweight.  A bit on the noisy side.  Has lots of options that aren't the easiest to figure out -- a lot of nested menus and if you aren't setting them all the time you have to rethink how to set them.  Got this Lowepro Toploader Zoom 45 AW (Black) to carry it in and it fits snug as a bug in a rug.  Nice all around camera.  Lightweight too.","This is a great camera, even used, it outclasses alot of new ones.  I purchased it because I wanted something close to a DSLR for image, but all in one - currently you can only get cameras with the tiny little point and shoot sensors as all in ones.  The C-8080 has a physical sensor size that is somewhere between those tiny point and shoot and a DSLR APS sized sensor - the bigger the sensor (not the megapixels), the better the picture (lens quality applies as well).  It also has a big fast (F2.4) lens (wide angle and gathers alot of light) and is built like a tank (Magnesium body I think).<br /><br />As a note, after this camera came out the entire industry shifted their pro-sumer lines (bigger physical sensors) over to DSLR's - since DSLR's were falling into the same price range.  They could make more money selling you lenses there.  So this was an example of the pinnacle of high end point and shoots.  Of course you couldn't get a DSLR with a high quality F2.4 lens built out of Magnesium for those prices...but that's the way the cookie crumbled.<br /><br />I have a small point and shoot, the C-8080 and a DSLR.  The pictures from this camera are so stunning compared to the point and shoot that I rarely use the point and shoot anymore (it is now the take it in dangerous conditions camera).  The DSLR pictures are slightly better, but the C-8080 is the Camera I take with me.  Its not too big, takes fantastic photo's (that lens and bigger sensor size) and just works.<br /><br />The one downside to it is that the auto-focusing doesn't work quickly in lower light (like evening indoors unless you're close to a bright light source) as you can have it hunt for a moment - losing instant picture moments - but you want a DSLR for that.  This doesn't get in my way much, even with a 2 year old daughter.  Highly recommended.","I have been reviewing the reviewers of this product.<br />I have owned this camera since it came out.<br />I have the lens adapter and lenses that are available for this product and have used them.<br />The pros: The camera has minimal turnaround time from shot to shot.<br />  It works the best in bright light whether indoor or out.<br />  It makes great portraiture shots in good lighting.<br />  It has great battery life.<br />  You can make a video with sound in video mode and the video is<br />  as long as your storage card will allow.<br />  You can play back video with sound on your camera.<br />  It takes two different brand of cards.<br />  This is a wide angle camera.  I also purchased a wide angle<br />  lens specifically for this camera that takes approximately a<br />  100 degree shot.....maybe more.<br />The cons: Does not do well in low light.<br />  Automatic view finder centers on wrong object.<br />  Searches when focusing sometimes (low light).<br />  I bought the telephoto lens specifically for this camera and<br />  have found that you cannot zoom with this attachment.  Also if<br />  you tend to get a tunneling effect if you do not have the fixed<br />  zoom lens positioned right.  I used this tunneling effect in my<br />  photos with good results.<br />  Does not take good action shots.","i think it makes things more complicated than they really need to be but it takes great pictures.  also....after purchasing the product, i learned that the camera has to have a proprietary zoom lens that is way more expensive than say, canon.  but other than that i am very happy.","Before this camera I owned the Oly C3030 and C5050.  All great cameras but they pale when compared to this one.  Even as I write this today, I would still recommend getting this camera used at a great price rather than spend more on a newer model.  It has every control a camera enthusiast could hope to have short of owning a higher end SLR, with the convenience of having everything in one fairly compact package.  After a little bit of a learning curve, this camera becomes intuitive and is a joy to use.<br /><br />Who is this NOT for?<br /><br />Someone who needs to shoot a lot of images in rapid succession at high ISOs, and who want interchangeable lenses.<br /><br />This camera has a rather slow buffer and file write time, especially if you are shooting RAW.  Also it only goes up to ISO 400 and noise is quite noticable at that ISO.<br /><br />Who IS it for?<br /><br />Everyone else.  If you shooting style is more sedate and you shoot at lower ISOs, you will be reward with stunning imagry and very little noise, if any.  You can exercise the utmost control over every aspect of your photography, or just set it on auto and let it do it's thing.  You will love the results and the wide angle 5x zoom is like have 3 lenses in one.<br /><br />Don't want to take my word for it?<br /><br />Feel free to visit my website (kramerkreations dot com) and peruse my photo gallery.  I think you'll agree that is one amazing camera at a great price.  If I had to do it all over again, I would get another C-8080WZ without hesitation.<br /><br />Happy shooting!","I've owned by C-8080 for over a year.  Several months ago, I bought a Canon Rebel XT DSLR.  The XT gets better resolution, focuses and stores faster, has a broader dynamic range, and slays the C8080 in medium and low light hands down.  Add an image stabilized lens to the XT, and performance-wise, the C8080 gets left in dust accross the board.<br /><br />But I still often I pack the C-8080 and leave the XT at home.  In good light or when using flash, the C8080 takes great pictures, with very respectable resolution and clean, bright, vibrant Olympus style colors.  It boasts a lens with one of the widest front diameters of all the digicams on the market (and thus captures more light), and the quality of the glass is superb.  Raw mode storage is slow, but the results can be wonderful---you can sqeeze one more level of resolution and color depth from raw.  Comparable pictures shot with my XT would blow up to bigger size, but the C-8080 is more than adequate for the typical 8-1/2X11's that I print at home.  The C-8080 can produce fine prints in many cases at 13X19.<br /><br />While not \"compact,\" the C-8080 is a tidy, convenient, sturdy tool that is suitable for the serious photgrapher.  The 28-140 mm is too short for field sports, but it's great for indoor people shots, landscapes, and the majority of common shooting situations.  Autofocus is generally \"fast enough.\"  The dual memory card format offers a convenient way to organize pictures and immense storage capacity.  I like the tilting viewfinder.  The control layout is a bit complex, but you learn to maneuver it.  It offers more precise control over shutter speed, aperture, and ISO than most digital cameras; ISO choices are, for example, 50, 64, 80, 100, 125, etc., instead of the more standard 50, 100, 200, etc.  This means, among other things, when you haven't got enough light for ISO 100, you might not need to drop to ISO 200 where you will pick up more noise; instead, maybe you can capture the shot at ISO 160. Noise is typically not an issue until you are pushing ISO 200.<br /><br />I wish the C-8080 offered image stabilization.  I wish it did  better in dim light.  I wish it zoomed out to 200mm or better.  But it is an easy camera to pack and operate, and in many, many situations, it does more than well enough.  This is useful, quality gear that was built to last a long time.","My background in photography extends back to my high school days in 1976, through selling cameras professionally for 6 years in retail post high school, and then later after college taking wedding photos with a Hasselblad and pro lighting for a few years 'on the side.'<br /><br />In 2002, I sold all of my film-cameras, and went digital with an Olympus C-3020 to start (a 3.2 mega-pixel camera).  In 2004, I upgraded to a C-8080 and bought a 2-gig card and extra battery.  In 2005, I purchased an E-300 Olympus, and both are 8 mega-pixel cameras.  The battery is exactly the same, so now I have three batteries and two chargers.  Staying in the Olympus family made the transition to new menues very easy, and when my wife takes the C-8080 (recently on a trip to China) I have the E-300 to use with additional lenses.<br /><br />I am very happy with the image quality of the C-8080, and with a 2-gig card, this unit can hold just over 1,000 high quality photograps, making vacation and family photography enjoyable and almost flawless.  Many have discussed the advantages and how \"great\" this camera is.  So, I will touch on some of the more sensitive areas.  Understand, first, that these are overcome by the other qualities of this camera -- it is really super.<br /><br />The C-8080 is an SLR (see through the lens), but understand that the image that one sees through the camera is a projected image, like a TV screen.  This is on EITHER screen, inside the camera or on the back.<br /><br />Contrast this with the E-300 and one sees the acutal image just like looking through a real (film) 35mm SLR in the E-300.  This is partially why I gave the C-8080 camera 4 stars (I would have rated it at least 4.5 if that rating selection was available).<br /><br />What that means is that, with either view, the image is using battery power.  Still on a two week treck across the US to Ohio and Michigan, I over came that worry with the extra battery, and in two weeks and over 400 images, I still had power to spare when I returned home.<br /><br />Additionally, looking at the image, one again does not see the actual image, but its reproduced equivalent.  In lower light, one cannot pick out, say, a reflection on a subject's shirt button or other small point of reference to use as a manual focusing reference (the screen does not display well in very low light).<br /><br />One offsetting advantage, though, is that the image display plate on the back of the C-8080 can be 'pulled out' and positioned (adjusted) so the photographer can hold the camera overhead to make shots in crowds of people, or it can be adjusted to view the image at waste level - kudos, Olympus!<br /><br />The other disadvantage that I find is the focusing in lower light.  Where on the E-300 that camera uses a pulsed flash to help in focusing, the C-8080 actually sends out an amber-colored beam to help \"illuminate\" a lower ligted area, but this is not a strong beam and doesn't help the photographer, other than to give one some illumination to try to see and watch the camera re-focus if at first the unit doesn't succeed.  This is the other reason why I gave this a 4-star rating.<br /><br />Overall, though, I love this camera.  It's all I used on several travels now, and each time I've been pleased with the results.  Even with its fixed (non-interchangeble) lens, the variety of focal lengths was quite enough in 98% of the photos, and the exposure meter is exceptional.  It can be used as easy as a point-and-shoot, and has some really nice advanced features.<br /><br />A person can take photos \"out of the box\" when the battery is charged, and in the meantime walk through some of the neat things outlined in the manual to learn the menu system and make advanced modifications.<br /><br />Last, but not least, the overall Olympus quality in digital cameras has without a doubt impressed me.","The sinister Minister here. To give you some insight on yet another camera that has inspired me to go forth and take pictures! The C-8080 has been my 2nd Olympus camera,(The e-300 was my first) and will most definitely not be my last.Some of you may have seen my review of the Sony V3 camera which I considered the ultimate point and shoot camera, that was until I got my C-8080. The c-8080 has all the important features of the V3 such as dual memory capability (XD & CF 1&2, Hot shoe, Etc.) But it surpasses in many other areas such as 5X optical zoom as opposed to 4X on the Sony. A swiveling LCD Screen, 8MP instead of 7.2 (yes it makes a damn difference) and finally a much more in depth and concise menu system and exposure control, allowing you tons of other options in how you expose and take your pictures,(Scene presets, shutter speeds, exposure control, focus options, White balance, ISO settings) On almost all counts the 8080 came out the topdog over the V3. Even the battery life is better.It was even as good as the V3 in low light wich really surpised me! Now understand that this is not a pocket camera neither is the V3 for that matter, I mean you could kill a mugger with this sucker and take his picture afterwards! Again not so with the V3, it is a sturdy camera to be true, but the 8080 is made of metal and forever. While on the subject of design-the 8080 is a larger but more comfortable camera to use, it fits sweetly in your hand and not quite as chunky as the V3. Shot to shot I rate them about the same as far as speed, and the Sony I think is a little quicker on start-up but not by a margin that would be outstanding. Okay so we did the tech thing now what about the pictures? Again I have to go with the C-8080. I found the color reproduction a little more on the money and over a wider selection of settings (which the V3 didn't have to begin with) I still love Sony's film clip mode and in camera editing features better than anything else out there however so that one goes to the V3.<br /><br />This review comes a wee bit late, Olympus has already released thier new models for the 2005 Holiday season and most of those suck in comparison to the 8080 (except the E-500-mines on order!). But even so I would reccomend picking up this camera while you still can. Because in its class there really isn't anything out there that can touch it as far a form, function, and the ability to take amazing photos! Some cameras do outlive upgrades & trends (like the Sony F-828) I think the C-8080 will follow suit.Actually its the new designs that have turned the 8080 into the ultimate point and shoot camera! Most point and shoot cameras are now between 6&8 MP (Fuji has a 9MP!!) have an optical range of 3-5X and are getting faster by the day! (well some are)<br /><br />The little camera that could? That could still be around in 2 or 3 years because its just one hell of a camera! I still stand by my 5 star rating I gave the V3, but as we speak I've sold mine and kept the 8080 to take its place.By the way theres one thing you should know about digital photography, that no salesman or self-proclaimed pro will likely tell you...you will outgrow your camera! But hey thats a good thing right!? So if YOUR ready to grow look no further! Thanks for reading and Happy shooting!","I have the D-490 Zoom and needed to upgrade.Great picture quailty but not enough MP and zoom.After reading reviews and being so satisfied with the Olympus I have I decided to buy the C-8080. I am no professional and needed a camera that would do almost everything automatically. The pictures are exceptional quality. I am still learning but that is why I bought one with so many features. I can grow with this one.","After having had 2 older olympus cameras I decided that I would stick to what I am familiar with and I purchased the C-8080. I am very pleased with the camera.<br /><br />Most of my picture taking is outdoor scenery and wildlife so that is what most of my review is based on. I rarely take indoor photos so I have no opinion as to the quality of it's indoor pictures.<br /><br />For outdoor use..<br />Pros:<br /><br />Picture quality is very good (Best for daytime use). It has a very quick startup time and the different options it offers are very nice. It allows you to set up the features you use the most and then saves those settings for future use (My Mode)..very handy in a pinch. I have discussed problems with the focus below BUT I wanted to point out that when you do get the camera in focus the pictures turn out fantastic (see butterfly photo in album). I have been using this camera for capturing butterflies and insects on flowers and am very pleased with the results! I have also photographed elk and deer with it and have gotten some awesome pictures. The battery on this camera is also very good. I have yet to purchase a second battery because the one that came with the camera has a long use life. I do plan on purchasing a second battery only because it is just a good idea to have one on hand. The camera is, in my opinion, easy to use and a very good camera for the money.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Nothing is without it's flaws and this camera is no exception.<br />I, like many other reviewers, am not real pleased with the focusing on this camera. If I want a closeup shot of a flower(for instance) then I have to back up a good distance away in order for it to work. The manual focus is not fantastic and you usually have to sit there for several minutes trying to get it to focus and, occasionally you will wind up taking several blurry pictures before you get one that will work. This is NOT good when you are trying to take pictures of moving targets! I have taken several deer pictures where the deer is fuzzy but the tree in front of it is clear as can be. Good thing it's digital and you can remove the unwanted photos! I have also found that in low-light settings the photos are almost not worth having as they are very grainy.","Purchased the C-8080 Wide Zoom to replace my Olympus C-3020. Excellent decision at first. Two months of great pictures, except in low light situations (poor focus). Then the bottom dropped out. The camera froze in the middle of the operation - just like my computer often does. Nothing worked - no zoom, no shutter, no on/off switch. Had to reboot by removing and replacing the battery.<br /><br />Operated normally for 10 shots, then ... iced again. Changed battery - functioned normally for 15 shots, then ... again. Changed to additional battery - three batteries - frozen again. Removed cards, one at a time - no difference. Currently undergoing repair at Hauppauge, NY.<br /><br />Love the camera - fits my hand well, everything except POWER SWITCH in acceptable position. Looking forward to getting it back. Optics are superb. Movie capability is excellent, with great sound pickup. Should be 4-star+.<br /><br />Will continue using my old 5-star rated C-3020 until the C-8080 returns. See follow-up review when I get it back. Will also include time duration for repair.","I bought a brand new, USA warrenty Olympus C-8080 camera a few weeks ago from Buydig.com--for $472.00, about half what this camera cost when it first came out last year.  Had considered an Olympus Evolt, but I went for the convenience of an all-in-one-piece high-end amateur camera which has been receiving very good reviews and seems considered the best of the 8-megapixel non-SLR cameras available.  I'm an illustrator and large-format photographer--and a  stickler for image quality.  The C-8080 produces beautiful images with sharp resolution and even illumination from corner to corner. The lens and image quality are simply superb.<br /><br />This is my second digital camera, the first being a Panasonic FZ10. Both these cameras have EVF's (electronic view finders) instead of optical view finders. EVF's are very useful--the screen actually gives some visual indication of an exposure before you take the picture. The FZ10's EVF is especially accurate in this regard.  The C-8080's EVF is less so--but it is only a matter of experience decifering the image that appears in the EVF before making the exposure.<br /><br />The C-8080 has far more functions than I am likely going to explore using.  Since I am mostly shooting landscapes , all I really want is confidence in the exposure and focusing functions of the camera--and after a few days of experimenting and a 2 day trip in Yellowstone shooting scenics, I'm quite pleased with how the C-8080 handles.<br /><br />I especially like the AEL (auto exposure level) button on the front of the camera.  It allows you to preset the exposure before focusing on the image--and generally, if a scene has both dark and very bright components, you will not get a good exposure if you just point and shoot. I found it necessary to point the camera at the brighter/brightest elements of a scene (pointing it well up into the sky with clouds, for example), then set the AEL, then return to the scene to be photographed and make the exposure.  The C-8080's EVF does not give you an accurate visual indication of the exposure--if the scene in the EVF looks good, likely it will be a little or more overexposed.  If the scene in the EVF looks disturbingly dark, then it is about right. When you have to choose between what looks good in the EVF and what the AEL button gives you, trust what the AEL button gives you--even if the view is very dark. Having shot 4x5 and 5x7 film in the field with a lightmeter and faith, the C-8080 exposures are a breeze.<br /><br />One disappointment with the C-8080--the manual focus functions. Various user reviews dating back to last year mention problems with the manual focus--and it seems to be a design flaw.  Not only is manual focus a time-consuming multi-step effort, but it doesn't work.  Photo results using manual focus at infinity are noticably inferior to the same scene in auto focus.  Hard to believe Olympus let this camera out of the lab with such a crummy manual focus ability.  I hope Olympus is reading this--they ought to design an easy, fast, one-step, \"get-me-there-now!\" manual infinity lock. In some low-light conditions, the auto focus has a hard time locking onto infinity--and you have to scout around in all directions to find anything far off that the cameras will settle on.  Using manual focus instead is out of the queation.  I should note, that in the two days in the field in Yellowstone, I did not have any problems with auto focus--it worked fast and reliably.<br /><br />The above said, the C-8080 is a great digital camera.  Prefered settings can be programmed and returned to quickly by turning the dial to 'My Mode\", which is very handy. Very good battery life.  Very good low compression JPG's. TIFF and RAW if you want them. Image color is very accurate (some call this neutral) and can be adjusted with various settings in many small increments. Also, the memory cards and batteries are compatiable with top-of-the-line Olympus SLR models. Just be sure when erasing memory cards in camera that it is set to the card you intend, since the C-8080 defers to the xd card (if an xd card is in the camera).","This will be short and sweet.  I just moved up to the C-8080 from the C-5050 (which I loved for several years now).  I am glad I did.  This is a (realitively) simple camera, two media types, and very easy to use.  The results have been great so far (4 days of joy) shooting plants, birds in the yard, the neighbors kids, and I can't wait for vacation this summer  where I think it will shine shooting vistas in Arizona.<br /><br />I am one happy camper that I bought this camera.<br /><br />I might add that I bought an extra battery so I can keep one charged at all times.  I'm still on my first charge.....<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera...","As other reviewers have already talked about this camera, I want to give my comparisons.<br /><br />Olympus C8080- The best so far. 8MP, picture gives you complete details.<br /><br />Olympus E10-A best 4MP SLR digital camera.<br /><br />Olympus E20-5MP, but very slow.<br /><br />Olympus C5060-Very good, slow start.<br /><br />Olympus C5050-Great camera and slow, not so good for big prints.<br /><br />Olympus C700 - Good zoom, very good color, bad contrast.<br /><br />Olympus C3020-The best at 3MP, very good for small photo prints<br /><br />Olympus C4040-The best at 4MP cameras, but had some issues with skin colors<br /><br />Olympus C50-Horrible focus and not happy with<br /><br />Olympus D510-Good camera for web photos, very poor color though.<br /><br />Olympus D360L-Good for web photos, no optical zoom.<br /><br />Nikon 990 & 995-The best 3MP camera but odd shapes.<br /><br />Nikon 3200- except the size of the camera, very disappointed<br /><br />Canon IS S1 - At 3MP and 10x optical zoom, this camera rocks.<br /><br />Canon S400 & S410-Good cameras, but you can not get the details of the subject.<br /><br />Panasonic DMC-FZ10K - Great optical zoom, but very poor image.<br /><br />Hope someone using these cameras find my review helpful.","I bought my C-8080 last summer, and I was immediately impressed with the image quality as I walked up and down the beach for hours testing the camera's features, not to mention the capacity of my Xd 512mb card. I have been abroad all year in France and this camera was the first item I packed. It has been able to withstand the Parisien winter downpours and still take some exquisite pictures. My shutterfly account has never been so full! The color tones of the camera's image sensor are increddible, and its feature set is limitless. The learning curve for the c-8080 is steeper than other cameras in its class, which is why I would call this camera a pro-enthusiast device. When you master the settings and buttons, the images improve that much more. One thing I have to comment on is the battery life...I have gone on trips for two weeks and did not bring the charger. It was only on the last day in Nice that the battery light started blinking, and I had gotten at least 35 pics in each day. The camera has survived my backpack, which is not the most forgiving place considering my traveling addiction, and has yet to have a scratch. Olympus has provided me with a great way to capture all my photographic desires in one package.","I have been using a Canon G5 for the last year. I wanted higher resolution (althought the Canon is excellent for 8\"x10\" images). I have read C-8080 Wide Zoom reviews on the most prominent review sites. I noted the comments about the excellent image quality and the comments about slow writes shooting raw, the power button too close to the shutter release, etcetera...Forget all the negative nonsense. I acknowledge that I am only one user in thousands of my new C-8080, but this camera is wonderful. The image quality is stunning. I took the time to read the online manual (I don't care if it wasn't printed all nice and tidy). I studied the settings, got used to the features. It took a few days of practice.<br /><br />I find myself truly motivated to plan outings to practice the art of photography. If my images aren't quite what I am expecting, I can use the incredible C-8080 feature array to make the necessary adjustments. I use a tripod when necessary. I use a polarizing filter when necessary. I am waiting to receive my FL36 Olympus flash for additional lighting when needed.<br /><br />If you are more serious about image quality and control than a particular button being \"here\" instead of \"there\", you should give this camera serious consideration. Buy it. Use it. Enjoy the art of photography. I'm leaving now to take my C-8080 Wide Zoom and create some new works of personal expression. Good luck to you in your own photographic experience!","This camera takes excellent, clear, vivid, high resolution images.  A myriad of different customizable variables.  Super bright lense system.  EXCELLENT battery life (more than 400+ photos w/ LCD screen ON and flash OFF).  The startup time for the camera is very quick, among the fastest I've seen.  Would definitely recommend over the other 8MP cameras.  Owned the 8080 for about two months now.","I'm not getting it.<br /><br />I have no problem with this camera defaulting to the xd card when you turn it on. It stays wherever it was when I shut it off.<br /><br />I'm having no problem with the power switch. It's on the top, the shutter is on the front. Since I'm still trying to learn how to walk and chew gum at the same time, I don't understand the problem many seem to be having.<br /><br />Swivel LCD? It's cute but the only use I found for it is taking a pic of myself in a mirror. (Not a pretty sight!) :)<br /><br />Low light problems? I have no complaints. Contrary to popular belief, *most* indoor shots with a digital camera *don't* need flash. In fact, more often than not, flash will ruin it. The \"film\" is free. Try it both ways. :) Experience will let you know when you need it and when you don't. Don't just pop up the flash simply because you are indoors. I remember a few years back reading a lot of complaints about my old nikon coolpix 800 having low lite problems but I never did. No problem with the c8080 either. And if all else fails... that's what they make Photoshop for! (And I hardly ever need it with this camera)<br /><br />Auto focus problems? Don't use it if it doesn't work for you. (Yes, it does have manual focus)<br /><br />Remote shutter release plugs in? I must be missing something again. I got a cordless one with the camera.<br /><br />The only con I have is that the manual has to be printed out, but what doesn't anymore? Never had a digital that came with a book.<br /><br />Ok, two cons. Yes, I know it's a heavy piece of equipment but still I would have liked a wrist strap.<br /><br />I learned from past experiences with digitals... even before you take your first shot, print the manual and read it.<br /><br />If you go by the old adage... when all else fails, read the manual... you do this camera and yourself a disservice. And reading it on your computer doesn't really cut it. You need to print it out or you're going to miss a lot.","Ok, this isn't one of my usual hands-on reviews.  I ain't got the kind of money to buy all these cameras and test them.  But I wanted to give potential buyers some help...<br /><br />Should you consider an SLR-type EVF (electronic viewfinder) digital camera or an interchangeable-lens digital SLR for serious photography?  I faced this question and agonized over it for months.  I wish I had come across this brief and very helpful article by Popular Photography Magazine (I'm not affiliated with them in any way):<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The article compares five current-model EVF cameras: Canon PowerShot Pro 1, Konica-Minolta Dimage A2, Nikon Coolpix 8700, Olympus Camedia C-8080, and Sony Cybershot DSC-F828.  It's a very easy read, and at the end the writers give you a helpful checklist for the EVF vs. d-SLR decision.<br /><br />As for myself, I'm going with a d-SLR since I want 1) high-quality lens, 2) lens choices, 3) little to no shutter lag, and 4) accessory choices.  Good luck!","As someone who has jsut begun to get beyond the basics in photography, this camera has allowed me to really grow.  This is a terrific tool and I have been extremely pleased with my pictures:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Yes, it is slow in low light to focus.  Yes it is a bit bulky (but feels good in the hand to hold) but that lens takes terrific pictures.<br /><br />I have had the camera for about 6 months now and love taking it out more every day.  Lots of flexibility and features to keep me busy.","I've pursued photography as a hobby for many years, and have been using digital cameras or a number of years.  After reading the glowing reviews of the 8080, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The camera build is excellent, and the ergonomics are great too.  It has a wonderful feel to it, and the controls are placed well.<br /><br />But, unfortunately, I have found this camera to be very slow focusing indoors, and that focusing is often inaccurate.  Shooting in a living room with an incandescent lamp or two, the focusing performance is poor, going through a hunting sequence.  It takes about 4 seconds to get a prefocus lock.  I have experimented with the AF light on/off, and various focus settings, but nothing really helped.<br /><br /> If you shoot mainly outdoors or in bright light, this is not an issue, of course, but if you intend to shoot indoors at holidays, parties, etc, you may be disappointed because of this issue.<br /><br />The playback time tends to be slow as well (using a CF card)... to move from pic to pic takes a second or two - noticibly slow.<br /><br />Others have discussed already the great picture quality, so I won't go into that here.  The slow performance in low light has made it a dissapointment for me, and I will return it.","Today's bright and sunny, but you have major photos in which you have to take for that over due book or portfilo. The olpmpus C-8080 wide zoom digital camera catches the closest snap shots when you need to get that 200-400 speed shot of a moving animal or that clear visible close-up shot of the models on runway.. Although, it may seem like a timeless task, but with this camera , the photos are taken like a breeze. Also, it is very easy to use ,so no need for that refresher course for visual commications for that new heads up on speed photograpy...<br /><br /><br /><br />So here's to the high life of the world of photography<br /><br /><br /><br />Thank You<br /><br />Shara L. Bouie<br /><br />Atlanta,Ga","After 40+ years of taking pictures in 35mm I decided to wet my toe in digital waters with an Olympus C2020. Used that excellent<br /><br />camera for three years and decided this spring to upgrade to the<br /><br />Olympus C8080WZ just then released by Olympus.<br /><br />This camera takes great pictures, many examples can be viewed at digicam.com by going to the forum for Olympus Digital. The Olympus lens is considered by many reviewers to be the best available for digital. So... why not five stars?<br /><br />End results are, of course, the bottom line in an camera but some weight must be given to how difficult it is to get those results. This is where I must hold back a star on the C8080WZ.<br /><br />The camera is difficult to focus in many situtations... low light, low contrast, fast moving subjects. There are options as to how the camera's auto-focus is applied but each has its own issues. I do not think Olympus has done a good job with the auto-focus in this otherwise excellent camera.<br /><br />Personally I don't like the EVF (electronic viewfinder). It is overloaded with information in my opinion and under high contrast conditions it suffers degrading vertical color bands which do not show in the photos but are distracting when trying to compose a nice landscape scene.<br /><br />The power zoom works... but I would prefer a manual zoon. Power zoom seems a waste to me, it is never as accurate nor fast as manual zoom and uses battery power in the bargain. I suppose this is a necessary evil but could do nicely without it.<br /><br />Maybe I'm spoiled by my years of Nikon SLRs that were straight forward in their operation. Look through the lens, set apature and shutter from built in metering, focus and trip the shutter.<br /><br />Now it's a half dozen choices to be made and in things like focus you really don't have much control anyway... the camera<br /><br />decides and you are stuck with that.<br /><br />My Olumpus C2020 remains my favorite for most outings. It is a true \"point and shoot\" and gives fine results within its 2mp<br /><br />capability. An 8mp camera that operated as nicely as my C2020<br /><br />would be a true \"upgrade\" for me.","I am still getting acquainted with this little gem.  In spite of all the criticism below, I am definitely happy with it.<br /><br />I have to say that I agree with pretty much everything JB said in his review \"Great in the day, noisy at night\" -- I haven't done any night work with this yet.<br /><br />So why post?  Some comments I've got are not included elsewhere.  Some are worth repeating.<br /><br />As mentioned in other reviews, I too have hit the power button when I wanted something else.  The main annoyance with this is the camera's configuration is reset on power-on, so if you had a shutter speed set, you get to reset it.  There is a camera setting to reset all settings on powerup or not which is presumably intended to correct this.  Personally I'd rather have the settings reset and have the power button recessed, or at least a little bit stiffer.  The power button is *very* responsive.<br /><br />I *LOVE* the startup speed.  It's on and ready to shoot before I can have the shot framed.  (This does take some of the sting out of hitting the power button accidentally)<br /><br />I *HATE* the manual focus.  It zooms into the center of the image and you are supposed to be able to tell from very raw pixels when you are focused or not.  It isn't as easy as it sounds -- slow, painful, inaccurate, and tedious.  There has to be a better way.  My Nikon CoolPix 995 boosted the sharpness of the preview in a way that let you tell what was in focus and what wasn't.  Still painful, but much better than this.<br /><br />The 8080 doesn't overexpose as much as my 995 did.  I like not having to adjust.  The only thing I have encountered (which I need to reshoot to understand better) was a pinkish flower in my yard that for some reason was oversaturated on the blue channel.  Probably an out-of-gamut RGB color?<br /><br />I very much like having all the buttons for individual settings.  The 995 was a real pain going into the menu and browsing to find the setting.  The 8080 is nice -- hit the right button, spin the wheel to the value you want without being required to dig through menus.  Those of you who like digging through menus will be relieved to know that you can do everything through the menus that you can do with buttons.<br /><br />I definitely like it.","Some thoughts from an amateur having been using it for a while.  Note that my overall score is high and I'm very happy with this camera: bang for the buck this is great.<br />So - these comments are deliberately critical since I think that's what most people want to know about.  If something really cool stands out - such as dark frame subtraction on this camera for us astronomers - then I'll point it out.<br /><br />1. Do not look at this camera as a 'point and shoot, slip it in my pocket' sort of camera.  This is big, has many functions and can be overwhelming at first if you're new to this level of camera.  That said - the functionality and positioning of features is exemplary: for example the dual use of buttons to allow quick access to features and settings.  Also, assuming you've got the camera setup how you want it - you can flick it on and be snapping away pretty quickly; the 'user setting modes' are great in this regard, since you can save different types of setup to allow quick access.<br />2. In auto focus mode, the camera can be a little slow to focus and you can miss your intended photo moment - frustrating!  You can set it to manual focus mode, but that can be slower since there isn't a focus ring for you to turn a-la-SLR.  You have to use the buttons to focus and that can be tricky with your eye wedged up to the viewfinder on sunny days!<br />3. A full printed manual isn't provided - it is online on the CD only.  I think that is cheap, Olympus!<br />4. I'm an astrophotographer and so far I've only been able to take piggy-back shots (not a problem with the camera - I just need to make some adapters).  Dark frame subtraction in night mode is extremely useful, but so far it seems the noise generated by the CCD is too much for it to handle, even in relatively short exposures (on a 75 degree F night at ISO400).  I'm going to try slower ASO speeds since that should improve it a litle, and I know cooler evenings will help a great deal, but still not off to a great start.  Also, cooling would help but at 800 bucks you can't get everything! ;-)  ADDENDUM 9/NOV/04: this camera works OK as an astrophotography camera, but basically you get what you pay for.  Because it isn't an SLR, it is difficult to achieve focus using the camera with it's fixed lens, through an eyepieve and into the telescope.  hugely magnified and actually too much noise to speak of.  I'm persevering, but I'd recommend the extra step to an SLR if you're going to be into astrophotography (Canon 20D)<br />5. The remote shutter release doesn't plug into the camera: you have to buy a power battery holder and plug the shutter release into that.  That seemed a little stupid to me and just an excuse by Olympus to make you buy more stuff.<br />6. I find it very frustrating that you can't plug the camera in to the mains (with the optional mains adapter) and CHARGE the battery with it still in the camera.  You have to remove the battery and use the separate battery charger.  That means more stuff to carry - and that's annoying.<br />7. Battery life seemed exceptionally good to me, but because of the charging scenario described above, I would get a spare battery<br />8. Video quality is good: I've taken a few but for some reason I have to convert them on my PC, presumably because of some coding issues (they import into Adobe Photo Album v2.0 but won't play).  ADDENDUM 9/NOV/04: this is now resolved and is not an issue related to this product, but rather some clash in load order between Adobe and Quicktime.<br />9. I don't like Camedia Master, whatever version.  I'd personally recommend the use of a separate photo manager and ditch Camedia.  The only useful thing I've gotten out of it so far is stitching some panorama shots together, which worked quite well but it won't stay installed on my PC just to do that!  Other software can do that, too!<br /><br />Overall?  I like the camera and it's taking some great shots that have printed onto 11x14 photo paper to produce stunning images.  I find it comfortable, easy to use (after a simple learning curve) and everything you'd reasonably expect from a camera at this level.<br />So far, though, I haven't been that impressed with the night time photography - but I'll be able to test that extensively soon so will update this review at that time.  ADDENDUM 9/NOV/04: my conclusion for astrophotography is it is worth saving some extra pennies and going for an SLR (the Canon 20D).  For daytime shooting, this camera has produced some stunning shots and I'm extremely pleased with it.<br /><br />Happy shopping<br />JB","After some extensive research on 8-megapixel digital cameras, I decided on the Olympus C-8080 for several reasons.  I'll highlight a few of them below.<br />* The magnesium cased Olympus C-8080 has a quality feel to it in my hands.  It feels solid.  This camera won't creak or flex when handled like some of the others I tried.<br />* The Olympus C-8080 power up time is extremely fast which is important for catching those special moments.  It has one of the fastest power up times of any 8-megapixel camera.<br />* The C-8080 has one of the best lenses available in its class with just the right balance of range and speed... The lens is rather large for good light gathering ability.  It's also very sharp.  At 5x and 28mm - 140mm (35mm equivalent) range, some might lean more toward a camera with a broader optical range sacrificing speed and quality.  For me, it's about quality not quantity!  I find that I often use 28mm indoors where space is limited or for those wide outdoor scenic shots.  And 140mm is usually sufficient for most of my 'telephoto' needs.  You can also purchase optional adapters for wider angle or more zoom if you find it necessary.<br />* Battery life on this camera is top notch... it's one of the longest lasting and far superior to most other 8-megapixel cameras.  Although I own 2 batteries for my Olympus C-8080, I have yet to need more than one for an entire day of shooting.  My findings pretty much mirror what the professional reviewers have tested with regard to long battery life on the Olympus C-8080.  I have yet to see my 'low battery' indicator come on!<br />I should also mention that I wear eye glasses which is a problem for me with some viewfinders.  Not so with the Olympus C-8080.  The ring surrounding the viewfinder is rubberized and when I place the lens from my eye glasses up against the view finder, I can see the entire frame clearly and comfortably.  The viewfinder also has a diopter adjustment to compensate for less than perfect vision.<br />Some people have commented that the controls on the Olympus are a bit confusing.  The camera is very versatile with many features and I've gotten used to the controls.  Also, the power on/off button is located fairly close to the shutter release button but I got used to this within just a few minutes.  It really isn't a problem.  Unless you're seriously lacking in manual dexterity, you'll get used to it very quickly.<br />Also, don't skimp on the memory card.  I have a 512MB xD card in the camera and keep a blank 256MB card in my pocket in case I fill up the first card before getting a chance to download all the images to my PC.  I might just get a 512MB CompactFlash card as well since the camera has a slot for both xD and CF style memory cards.<br />To quote another reviewer, the Olympus C-8080 is the one to get!","This is my third digital camera. My first was a canon powershot g3-- A camera I would still be using if it hadn't developed a problem with storing images to CF cards and downloading them to the computer.  My 2nd camera is a Canon s100 point and shoot.  Just so that you can understand the view point of this review, I will let you know that I consider myself an amature with intentions of improvement. If you are a pro photographer or even an advance amature,  this review won't offer you much.<br />That being said, if your aspirations are like mine, this camera is an excellent choice.  I explored most of the major online sites prior to making my choice: Steve's Digicams, DPR, etc.  All those sites gave the camera high marks.<br />What I liked most about this camera was the image quality.  It had the least noise, and least chromatic abberation and distortion of any of the 8 megapixel cameras in nearly all the reviews.  Since what I wanted most at the end of it all were excellent photos,  this was enough for me to make my choice.  And if you aren't happy with the shots straight from the camera, you can tweak every thing from sharpness to saturation to achieve the results you want.<br />Other features that I liked included the wide array of image size, and shooting options available.  I felt that this camera could certainly grow with my skill level for years to come.<br />Many have complained about the placement of the power button.  I haven't had any probs with it.  I have not accidentally turned it off or on even once.<br />Now what I would change if I could:<br />Oh I wish the LCD were a swivel display.  I have grown accustom to this with my canon.<br />The flash does not automatically pop up when you need it.<br />The EVF is taking some getting used to.  I am still wary of weather or not what I am seeing actually represents actually color, lighting etc...<br />The menu system could use some revision.  I am sure it will take me a while to learn to use the camera to its best capacity  simply because the menu system is not intuitive.  You actually need to read the manual and the one on the CD to work out the ends and outs of the camera.<br />The camera defaults to the xD card if you have a both and xD and a CF card in place.  This has caused me some problems.  You will be less frustrated if you only have one or the other installed.<br />I like this camera more and more every time I use it. I researched my choice exaustively and none of the other 8 megapixels currently available even tempt me when I look at the whole picture.  I don't think this camera will dissappoint you .","Here's a little optic lesson.<br />The higher the zoom ratio i.e. 2x vs 7x, the more problems with the lens.  This may show up as<br />distortion, out of focus corners, resolution, etc.  Generally, the greater power, the more<br />apochromatic problems with the lens.  Also the higher the zoom power, the lens gets larger or the<br />f/ get smaller as it's zoomed.  Olympus did a very good job with this lens.  The \"cost\" of a greater<br />power would be of not much value if they had to compromise the image quality.  Just about, the<br />only one who cares about 5x vs 7x are idiots.  Don't get a complex over it.  You have the best lens (for 8MP camera's today)","I bought this camera a month ago. so happy with that.<br />This is my first digital camera, so I am not sure I have to authority to compare?<br />Bought this one since all my previous cameras were Olympus and I loved them.<br />However, I am a bit questioning the 5X optical zoom. Since I am new to digicam I am not sure what I am missing here. Can someone please say what is the drawback of having 5X in the C8080 versus the 7X or more in the Nikon Coolpix and Minolta A1/A2?<br />Thanks","If Robert F Derenthal contacts me, I will send him the CD for the 8080.  erroha@bluefrog.com","Make sure your read the last paragraph of this review to see why an outstanding camera gets only three stars.<br />Before buying this camera I read a variety of professional reviews on various websites. The consensus seemed to be that this was the best of the lot of the new 8 megapixel cameras. As a lifetime Canon owner who also  has a Canon D60 6.3mp SLR digital camera I was disappointed that the new Canon Pro1 didn't get as high ratings, but I believe that quality pics beats any brand loyalty that I might have.<br />I was in the market for one of these new high resolution cameras because I wanted something to carry around for quick shots when I didn't want the trouble of lugging my Canon D60 and a  host of lenses.<br />I took it on a recent trip in to the California coastal mountains. I was totally pleased with the results. The professional reviewers were all concerned with noise in higher ISO settings for this breed of cameras. All of my pictures were shot in the range of ISO 100 to 160 in bright light. I used Photoshop to greatly enlarge pictures taken at 100 and 160 and compared them for noise. ISO 160 pics were noisier, but still printed out clear 7.125 by 9.5 prints. Colors were very accurate, and I noticed no significant distortion.<br />The large number of buttons and menus posed no real problems for me. You just work yourself gradually into this, and soon you are at ease. I particularly liked the button on the top that allows you to make a custom setting. I use it for ISO settings, making it a breeze to quickly change ISO when I want to.<br />What criticisms can I make? Here's my brief list:<br />1. Buttons on the top right of the camera are very crowded, and it takes a while to get used to them, and not be changing the wrong one. I find it somewhat difficult to hold down the custom button and rotate the selector wheel at the same time.<br />2. I am not too enthralled with the electronic viewfinder. I found it sometimes difficult to see things clearly, and colors were harder to detect as accurately as in a normal viewfinder. I particularly had problems adjusting a circular polarizer filter to best effect.<br />3. I am used to manually zooming an SLR camera, and the power zoom on the c-8080 is a bit frustrating. It is difficult to zoom to the exact point that you want. You keep over and under zooming it. But I suppose this is a problem found on most power zoom cameras.<br />As most professional reviewers have noted, this camera is built like the photographic equivalent of a tank. It feels solid and indestructible, a heft that you usually find only on very expensive professional cameras.<br />Oh yes. Why did I give this camera only a three star rating. When I received the camera the software disk was broken. The disk is important insofar as Olympus is too cheap to provide a complete manual with the camera, and a further 180 pages or so of it are on the disk. Three phone calls and an email, and over a month later I get a software disk in the mail. But it's not for the c-8080. Another phone call and I am told the that the c-8080 disks come only with the camera itself. They have no extras, and I will simply have to do with this one which is written for other cameras. It supposedly will suffice for the camera to computer interface, although the c-8080 is missing from the reference manual of listed cameras. When I first called and waited on hold for a long long time no one even new how to deal with this problem. I was given the run around from department to department to department. You better hope that nothing is damaged in shipment, and that you never ever need tech support from them.","I've owned the c2020, c5050, nikon's 5700, canons d10, in that order,and I'm back with olympus c8080. theres nothing in my opinion like the glass of olympus, great for daytime shots, too slow in low light situations. the on off button is to close to the wide angle, telephoto button it's taking some time to get used to. pros.........the colors are the truest no need to adjust in photoshop, and rarely in photoshop with this camera...what you see is what you want to keep! it's alot of camera for a small package........very light for all thats inside....go olympus!","I've owned nine digital cameras at one time or another, looking for the perfect one. The olympus E-20 came close except for the weight and that monsterious lens that scaried the hell out of people. Then i found the Fuji S7000, which is a great one and i thought nothing could ever beat it. So i was hesitant to buy the Olympus 8080 but was glad i did. As soon i handled the camera, i knew this was different. I love the camera more each day, it grows on you. It has licked most if not all the past problems associated with digitals. Speed in all departments and well, what you read in the specs is all true. and the price is also great. I was a little worried about the placement of the off and on button, but i got used to it.","I bought this to supplement my E-20, and after having used it for just over two weeks, I think I'll put the E-20 away.<br />Pros:<br />-Nice size. I have big, arthritic hands, and it is a joy to use<br />-Best image from any digital i've owned, and i've got/had a few<br />-FAST, FAST, FAST, except for playback<br />-Quiet<br />-Beautiful resolution, edge to edge.<br />-I really like the rubber grip on the lens (and the body)<br />-Great battery life.<br />Cons:<br />-Slow playback (but I rarely use it, so ho hum)<br />-You must have a micro drive for images<br />-Lens cap doesn't fit well with lens hood (nitpick).<br />I am particularly impressed with blues and greens. Great rich color and great detail. Can be manipulated to give results very much like film, or crank up the saturation, contrast, whatever, and go crazy.<br />I also really like the sort of odd angle the lens is at with the body and the viewfinder, makes the camera VERY intuitive to aim and hold. I've seen some complaints about the position of the power button and exposure button, but I find them very well placed. All the controls on the left side of the camera are easy to access when holding the camera with your right.<br />My brother, who is a photo novice bought the camera at the same time I did, and he is producing very nice images, just using it point and shoot.","Very good camera but...<br />If you shake the camera, it rattles, the lens is not firmly mounted.<br />The power botton is horriable.  You can hit it with you finger working the camera and be turning it off in the middle of an operation.<br />Highlights can easily be blown out.<br />Focus in the dark are out of focus.<br />jog wheel is over too far, and trigger bottom tripped over the front too much, instead of on top.<br />Pixel per pixel, my 2 MP Canon S110 is by far sharper.<br />Odd backround noise in movies.<br />Most external flashes hit the pop up flash, making it no good.<br />Lens hood will interfere with flash on 3 ft close ups.<br />Can not come close to SLR optical manual focusing.  This has manual by buttons.  Not that great.<br />Slow post views of images.<br />LCD sticks out and I'm afraid will be the blunt of bumbs.<br />Battery charger has cord.  My Canon, has flip out AC plug.<br />Have not used software yet.<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />Since most people only want the bad, that's what's above.  I don't have the time to list all the good.  I think this is the best 8MB to date.  Bought for $789  I'm still learning about it too.  Wanted the Nikon D70, but with lenses and flash, too much $.","If your like me and dont have a bunch of lenses already there that could be added to the camera as in the Canon Rebel then the next best choice is to try to get a camera that has all you need in one camera. This camera also feels better than any other camera I tried. And I tried them all, HP, Canon, Minolta, Fuji, Sony, and Olympus less expensive older models.<br />That is what I see is one of the main advantages of the Olympus C-8080. It is a very flexible highly featured camera. The lenses on it feature both wide and telephoto capabilities and Olympus has taken the time to make sure that the lense does well in these areas. They were special produced for this camera.<br />I have been able to get some excellent image quality out of my Olympus C-8080 so far. By excellent I mean that there is alot of detail in mid tones. Some of the noise artifacts in high contrast areas in other cameras such as purple hazing seem to either not be there or greatly reduced. In other words I have not seen that as an issue. This is attributable to a new CCD for the camera that impliments cyan dots into the color capture system. I love the extra colors I am getting from the CCD on board that has increased my color ranges in blues and greens as well as neutral shadow areas.<br />Olympus also implimented an anti noise feature in this camera that is said to help with those issues.<br />This camera is complex. It will take alot of time to be able to use all its featured capabilities. The menu system is intuitive and very customizable.<br />Am I glad I bought it? Yes definitely.<br />Also look at the built in historgram. Better than any of the competion. That is because it has a historgram in a historgram. You can learn on line how to use historgrams and then that feature will mean more.<br />Negatives:<br />Red laser focus system can be blinding for shooting portraits<br />lack of stablization system like Minolta uses<br />Lack of illuminated controls for night shooting","Pros: Outstanding picture quality, surprisingly low noise level, fast startup time, magnesium body, USB 2.0 PC interface.<br />Cons: power off/on button is located too close to the shutter.","The Camedia body design has always been traditional, which I've favored over Sony's outlandish model F717 & F828 body/lens layout. The C8080 has a nicely refined body style. It's a compact 4.75\" wide, by 4.7\" deep, and 3.4\" high. For old-school film SLR users like myself, it resembles that look and feel. The ergonomics is just about perfect. It's a real joy to hold, even with one hand. The controls are easy to see and become acquainted with. The shutter lag is almost undetectable. And if you set it for continuous frames (1.6 fps), it will give you 3 to 5 shots in quick succession. The lens and picture quality is up to par with the previous Camedias. Olympus lenses are outstanding. The 8 megapixels sure help.<br />The things I like about the C8080 are: 2 memory card slots (CF and XD)and you can toggle between the 2 cards. So if you have a 512 MB capacity for both cards, that's 1024 MB total. If you want more, get an IBM 1GB microdrive.  You don't have to download software. Plug into the USB 2 in your PC, and you're in business (Win XP os). The viewfinder is electronic, which saves on battery consumption. The display screen can tilt up or down, and is visible even in bright sunlight. It's very comfortable to hold and shoot. And of course, it's got 8 megapixels. The thing I don't like about the C8080 is you have to remove the battery to charge it.<br />For pro-level amateurs and professionals, I recommend it highly.",">shoot short videos (without audio)<br />The odd thing is that the review says \"without audio\" (as above) but the Olympus website says it works with audio as the 5050 etc do.  Any idea why it would say that?"]},{"name":"Olympus C-765 UZ","amazon_reviews":["2nd one I had gotten - takes a lot of abuse , high quality pictures - definite recommend !!!!","April 21, 2016<br /><br />My husband and I have actually owned three of these cameras, at some point. I purchased the first for him, sometime between 2001 and 2003 (yes, that long ago!), and he absolutely loved this camera. According to him, it took clear, sharp pictures, and it had a really good macro setting. He was actually quite upset when, a few years ago, he lent the camera to his niece, who subsequently left the camera in her car, in plain view and with the doors unlocked. Naturally, the camera was stolen. Even after several years and new cameras on the market, though, he insisted on replacing his camera with the exact brand and model I had purchased for him. When he saw a second one in better condition, he gave me the first one he purchased, and he still continues to use it, to this day, along with several other cameras he's collected. As for me, I have three cameras: the one on my Prism 2 phone, which is terrible, as it has no flash, causing the pictures to come out blurry, a Fujifilm camera which isn't very good at taking still pictures, but is great for video, and this one, the Olympus, which is the camera I prefer, when taking still pictures. (It takes great video, but my favorite use for it is still images. I'm more likely to take casual videos with my Fujifilm camera, though, as it is smaller and easier to carry around in my purse, which is why I keep it on me, more often, in case I ever run across something worth taking video of.)<br /><br />About a month ago, there was a bunch of moving around, going on, so I hadn't been able to find its battery charger. I finally remembered I'd lent it to my husband, for his camera, as he had lost his own charger. I'm very glad to have gotten it back, because all of my product pictures, up till this point, have been made with my Fujifilm camera, and the pictures are awful. At least, with the Olympus, I can take reasonably decent pictures with it. I'm not much of a photographer, but this camera helps me pretend I'm a passable one. If this camera broke, I'll likely try to replace it with one exactly like it, to be honest.","Camera seems to work great.  Arrived in good time in good shape.

While technology has advanced WAY beyond the capabilities of this model, it still suits us well. Compact, handles fair resolution, battery life not too bad, and came with a charger for the rechargeable box battery. I have purchased many many Olympus digital cameras over the last ten years plus at work, and knew this would be a good bet. I will buy Olympus again and again. I haven't had a bad one yet!","This Olympus C765 replaces a Nikon Coolpix 2100 (reviewed here two + years ago.  Of course, the resolution is better, but it is almost as small and it is just as simple (or simpler) to use.  I have been very pleased in the past month of so that I have owned this.<br /><br />Among other features, the \"C\" series has exceptional optical zoom capabilities (the C765 is 10X).  In my opinion, this is one of the most important features of a camera, as you can do the zooming up front without burning through pixels during a touchup.  The lens quality is fine.<br /><br />Both of my children have \"C\" series Olympus cameras, one as much as 4 years old (the camera, that is), and love them.  I'm expecting a long life for this puppy.<br /><br />Two small nits:  The default setting is to use the LCD screen when going into photo mode - I prefer to use the viewfinder.  You can toggle to this, but it's a minor hassle. If you prefer the LCD, you'll be fine. Secondly, the software that comes with the camera seems to demand that you store your work in their proprietary \"albums\" buried deep in the program.  I will need to work with this more to make my photos more accessible.<br /><br />As usual, you will want to buy a larger memory card.  I also sprang for a case.<br /><br />All in all, very satisfied.","I bought the 765 primarily for the 10x zoom and the sports mode.<br /><br />It was priced right and the 3rd digital camera I own.<br /><br />The automatic settings are great and in my spare time I try to work with the manual adjustments which are plentiful.<br /><br />For sporting events the continuous mode works well for action, but must be reset if the camera is turned off.  You should also have a monopod or tripod when using the zoom.<br /><br />It's not an SLR, but the lag time and features are the next best thing.  The C series is being replaced and on line is about the only place you can find this model.  Got it in 3-4 days.","Has everything you will ever need.  Small size is compact and excellent for small hands of a 12 year old.  Not loaded down with options that you will never need or use once in it's life time.  If it doesn't have it, you probably don't need it.","I recently purchased this camera and therefore haven't used it a lot. So far, I like it a very much. I read a review of it from DCRP Review: Olympus C-765 Ultra Zoom. The review was very good. I like the 10x zoom capability; my pictures are very clear. The camera has more bells and whistles than I'll be able to use now but I am glad to have them. I recently signed up for an online course on digital photography and I am very glad I purchased this camera. I think my creativity will be pleasantly challenged. In addition it is very light and easy to hold (or carry). I am looking forward to many pleasant photography experiences on my own and in connection with my course. One experience - I was watching a DVD calculus course. The instructor was tracing a graph with a cursor. My daughter's cat was fascinated, stood on his hind legs and batted at the TV. I was able to quickly set up the camera and take a terrific shot of CC the cat learning calculus. I would recommend this camera for novices and professionals alike.","I love this camera!  It has everything i need on it! It is easy to use and the pictures come out beautifully.  The zoom is great and the sports setting takes great action shots!!!!!!!!  I highly reccomend this camera!!!!!!!!","I recently purchased this camera as an \"upgrade\" from the basic Pentax Optio50 camera I had lost earlier this summer. I am already noticing several flaws compared to the other, cheaper camera:<br /><br />* It is far more difficult to use -- you have to change the settings manually each time you wish to use the additional digital zoom. A number of other settings, including the macro modes, require time-consuming manual changes. This is in stark contrast to the automatic style of the Pentax, with several modes to choose from on the wheel atop the camera. The zoom is also set up awkwardly, so that you can't do it with your finger still on the take button.<br /><br />* I notice already that the picture quality is much worse, despite the mere 1MP difference. All of my photos come out with red-eye, no matter how I set the flash and camera.<br /><br />* Shutter speed is extremely slow, as is on/off.<br /><br />* Focus is terrible. The first couple of days I got this camera, I was excited to go out and experiment with different modes -- night mode, macro mode, portrait mode, action mode. Even while steadying my hand and taking care not to move at all, the photos always turned out blurry. The ONLY usable mode left on the camera is \"auto,\" and even then the photos are often blurry.<br /><br />I admit that I am no expert with cameras. However, in comparing this (more expensive) camera to my little Pentax, I find that the additional zoom is hardly useful. I don't even want the camera anymore, but I purchased it through a non-Amazon retailer (still at amazon.com) and the return process is proving more complicated than it would be had I paid the extra $20 to get it straight from  Amazon.<br /><br />I hope that reading the above issues with this camera will help you make your decision. I would strongly suggest buying directly from amazon.com in any case -- from what I understand, their return and service policy is worth it, no matter which camera you choose.","I have had this camera for over 1 year now and just bought 2 more for my office.  It is a terrific super zoom, easy too use and has enough advanced features for the serious amateur photographer.  It is not completely idiot proof but it is not meant to be.  It is also very economical given what some of the other super zoom models cost these days.  I highly recommend it.","I got this camera recently as a replacement for my 4 years old C-700 that broke when I dropped it to the ground by mistake. Although some reviewers said that this camera is bulky in comparison to other popular digital cameras, I find it more compact than my old camera and does not look silly even if you bring it to a party & etc. However, due to its  protuded lens part, it won't fit into a small camera case so choose a medium camera case if you are looking for one. The camera is pretty fast (except for the night mode) and gives a clear photo. Tripod is a must for a dark room since a hand vibration could cause blurred photo like most digital cameras. It doesn't bring out big red spots like my old camera in the dark room, but taking photo with a night mode is slow. Taking video with this camera is pretty good in a lit area. The instruction booklet is hard to use (reduction of details in favor of having millions of translations) and playing with a camera might be a better learning technique. You can set the camera in Japanese, English, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Russian (prob) so the camera itself is user friendly for international people.","I guess it is my own fault but with such a powerful zoom the lens must be large.  Other than a but bulky the camera takes great pictures, also you must remember to put the flash up, it is not automatic.","This camera takes great pictures. This is my first digital camera and I know how to do the basics. The manual didn't do a good job explaining how to use the more detailed features. The camera is very light and I like the fact, that it shuts off, after it is not being used for 3 minutes. I am very happy with this purchase.","I bought this camera one year ago,after doing extensive research for 2 months reading other reviews online. I have never had a camera capture the true pure colors of what I was photographing like this little gem does!!! I love the 10 optical zoom and even took a few not too bad 40x digital zoom( alittle grainy though)of birds outside my dining room window.  However, like life it does have it's little quirks. It is not the greatest camera for low light indoor pictures ie.in a restaurant. The camera needs a tripod for low light focusing. Also, Olympus really should include a better paperback manual instead of having it on a CD. I actually went to my office & downloaded the CD to paper and understand now why Olympus put the info onto a CD! I now have a 124 page BINDER!  It took me a little while to get use to the tiny XD card & the lithium ion battery. Use to it now, no big deal! I had no problems when I went to Italy,using an adaptor convertor,some people on our trip did though with other camera models. I bought my adaptor at Radio Shack. To download pictures easily to my lap top I use a DAZZLE digital media adaptor. Works like a charm!! When traveling at least a 256 memory card is needed and an extra battery. Still LOVE the camera and get tons of compliments on my photos.","This camera takes great pictures.  The detail it captures is amazing.  It is easy to use and much smaller and lighter than I thought it would be.<br /><br />The camedia software it comes with made my computer blue screen and I lost my pictures, so I don't recommend installing the software.  Luckily, I hadn't erased the pictures from my camera, so nothing was lost.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the camera is great and the software is terrible.","My 4-years-old Fuji digital camera was dead because I left it outside and get rained for two days. I spend quiet a lot time searching for a upgrade. Cannon A95 almost got my attention because its good review on Amazon. However, I am tired of small zoom. Then this Olympus C765 with 10X zoom got my attention. It has all the advanced functions I would like to have: movie, sequential shoot, and several preset shoot modes. This one has everything. Then I bought it finally. I just finished the first round of testing. The pictures are great, the color is beautiful, and the zoom is amazing. The software and manual is very easy to use. I am glad that I have the perfect upgrade.","I just treated myself to this camera as an early birthday present and, I must admit, I am quite impressed.  This is my first \"quality\" digital camera and I am very happy with it so far.  After ordering it, I received the camera within four days and have been snapping at least 10-30 pictures a day for the past week to familiarize myself with the many different settings that it provides.<br /><br />Before committing to this camera, I did quite a bit of research online;  reading reviews and deciding on what type of camera would best fit my current and future needs.  I am a novice photo snapper, and after buying this camera I must say that I can see myself getting into photography as a hobby.  This camera offers a wide range of manual settings.  It has a full manual mode that allows you to control the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO setting (64-400) along with manual focusing, for when the camera just can't seem to get a good lock on what you want it to.  The 10x optical zoom was one of the selling points for me, as using digital zoom degrades your final photo quite a bit.  It does have a digital zoom option, however I will never use it for that reason (which is one of the \"lies\" of digital camera marketing).  As far as picture resolution goes, the C765 has 5 different quality modes (TIFF, SHQ, HQ, SQ1, SQ2), each of which has it's own resolution modes along with it.  So, for the casual picture of friends and family that you might take, 1280x960 (SQ1, High) would be more than enough to print a quality 4x6 picture for the photo album.  However, personally, I like having the option of using extremely high resolution (TIFF, 2288x1712) for those pictures where you would want more detail and may like to print a larger copy.<br /><br />There are few things that I must recommend when buying this camera.  You absolutely must buy a bigger memory card, as the included 16MB card is just not enough.  This camera has a movie mode as well, and 16MB only gives you a 14 second movie before the card is full.  I bought a 256MB card along with it and, at 1600x1200, you can fit 182 pictures on it (with approx. 13 minutes of video if you want to use it).  Another accessory that I highly recommend is another battery (Li12B).  I have found with my tinkering that the included battery (Li10B) will only last for 1 - 1 1/2 hours of continuous use (with the LCD on).  It sounds like a long enough time but you definately should have at least one extra battery just in case.  Lastly, I highly recommend a tripod.  I have found it quite hard to keep my hands steady enough to take a sharp picture at full zoom... plus using the manual settings you can have the shutter open for up to 15 seconds (for night photos, extremely low light, and creative photos), and it's close to impossible to get a non-blurry picture at that setting.<br /><br />So, to end my rather lengthy review of this camera, I highly recommend this camera to any user who wants complete control over his/her photos.  It is definately a learning experience deciding when to use specific settings, but taking the time to go through the manual (full manual on the software cd) will give you a better understanding of the finer points of digital photography.  I look forward to experimenting with all of the options that are available to me and hope that my review of this camera helps someone else decide upon this excellent camera for the relatively low price.","Olympus is known for great lenses and the C765 is no exception.  Outdoor shots are terrific, indoors the camera tends to hunt to focus (Olympus did not equip the camera with focus assist beam for indoor shots, hence the 4 stars).  Menus are intuitive and customizable so you have your most used functions 1 button away.  Overall, a great cam for the money.  After cam purchase, be sure to go to olycap.com and buy the nifty little aftermarket product that protects the C765's lens.  It looks cool too.","I've had an SLR most of my life and several point and shoot models, plus an inexpensive digital.  This is the best camera I've ever owned!  It'll take me 6 months to figure out all the things it does do!<br /><br />One GREAT thing about this camera...it is NOT HP!  I had an HP digital and then bought and HP 3 in 1 printer thinking they'd compliment each other.  WRONG!  HP makes nice hardware but they have the BUGGIEST software going!  The camera's software actually conflicted with the Printer's software and both were HP!<br /><br />Now, no worries and no ugly \"dock\" to stick it in (that only works about half the time too).  This camera just plugs directly into the computer and download away with NO conflicts!  The Camedia software is nice, if rudimentry.  I would advise a Print Shop Pro type program to REALLY work with your pictures, particularly if you do any web hosting/posting.<br /><br />I took a picture of our black german shepherd at dusk, sitting in a shadow covered corner of the house and did NOT use the flash, just to see what would come out (the HP camera would have rendered a black screen).  With no flash I got a GREAT picture of our dog without that possessed look that you get when your dog looks directly into the flash.  Just amazing pictures.  I took another one of the flowering bush outside out house THROUGH the window and there is no way you could tell!  My daughter commented that the picture was nice enough to put on a calendar. And she's right.<br /><br />For less than $300 this camera takes fantastic pictures.  Of course you have to have an eye for your photo taking too.  I have a friend who bought a $1200 camera and his pictures stink because he thought a more expensive camera would make him a better photographer....WRONG!!! hahahahaha!!<br /><br />You can macro set this camera (ultra close ups) or shoot sports or shoot in just about no light at all.  If you want one camera that'll last you for years to come, this is it!","My husband just bought us this camera, and we love it. We're both long-time photographers, and have run the gamut from high-end SLRs to PHDs (Push Here Dummy.) This camera is excellent for everything we do with it, from adding images to our website (see [...] to compare some photos which were scanned in to those which came straight from the camera) to selling things on Ebay, to making prints to send to grandparents.<br /><br />It is simple to use, easy to get started (no need to read the entire manual unless that's your thing), and painless to transfer files to computer or printer. I do agree that a larger memory card is a must-have from the get-go, and we also purchased the USB reader, although you can connect the camera directly to your computer with the provided cable if you wish.<br /><br />The only downside I've found is that it can be hard to see the screen in bright daylight, but it's easy enough to switch to the viewfinder in those situations. The color is clear, the depth of field excellent, and the detail glorious. If you're thinking of buying this camera for home or light office work, don't hesitate, go for it!","I shoot thousands of close up pictures per year of American Indian jewelry for my website (most at a distance of 8\" to 24\"). See Chacodog.com for real examples of close up photos from this camera. I'd been using an Olympus C3020 for the last three years and liked it very much, both for ease of use and the true color it produced. All such shots are taken outdoors and everything is taken on auto settings in macro mode. It was time to  step up and I was favorably disposed to Olympus cameras (I have a Canon SD10 ELPH and, while it's okay, it's not as easy to use the menus as on an Olympus and it seems to yield colors that are a little more vivid than what you shoot). I chose this camera because there was no point going beyond 4 megapixels for web photos (most people reduce their photos in size to send them via e-mail, etc. and throw out half or more of the pixels, so anything beyond 4 megapixels is for the thin air crowd, i.e., pros). Cutting to the chase: I was stunned by shots I got effortlessly with this camera. Particularly, it was easier to shoot in several different light conditions with it and the C765 would adjust automatically for conditions and create a great shot whereas my old C3020 could produce a great shot on auto but the light had to be within much narrower perameters for success. This camera also has super macro, which I needed because I sometimes shoot objects that are too small for the C3020 to focus on properly at 8\" and beyond (which is the closest it will work). The C765 will get you to within 1 1/2\" on super macro. Okay, granted, this is very specialized as a need, but someone out there needs this for the same reason--shooting close ups for eBay, for example, if you're running in eBay's hamster wheel, on their treadmill, working in their salt mine. I found that this camera produced much less noise than the C3020 and I still prefer Olympus colors to those produced by my Canon ELPH. I may shoot thousands of photos per year, but it's wash and wear photography. It has to be true for color, but I don't have time to do much more than crop, re-size and re-name photos. I can't take hours touching up photos (which wouldn't necessarily yield a true photo, just a pretty one). I need a camera that does most of the work automatically and permits me to shoot up to 200 photos in a session with a high rate of success and produces honest shots which don't need tweaking. This has a vastly improved speed on focusing and just knocks out the photo right. I make a living with this camera and it carries its weight and more. My only regret? That I spent too long shooting with the C3020 before upgrading. I just figured that any problems with my pictures were my fault and eventually I got to where I had a 90+% rate of success with the C3020. Who cares if it was my fault--moron or not, I can shoot great pictures faster, more consistently and effortlessly with this machine.<br /><br />I was also intrigued by the zoom power on this camera and hoped that getting all these features wouldn't bugger the most important one for me--close ups. Anyway, I've used the zoom at outdoor track meets and gotten great, clear shots from 50 or 60 feet. And I've used the high-speed sports setting coupled with sequential shooting at track meets to get crystal clear shots of track events with runners at full speed (100 meters finish, coverage of all eight lanes in the curve on the 4 x 100).<br /><br />Had I paid a little more attention when buying this, I would have bought the C770 to get the MPEG video and the remote control (though I might never use either one). I find the battery life on a charge is wholly acceptable and I always have a spare battery charged. Likewise, I prefer having two xD cards of 256--it's plenty of pictures to shoot without uploading to the computer and a larger card just isn't necessary for me. Great deal on the 256's, so no sense in buying 128's. In short, buy an extra battery and two cards (the one they give you has zero capacity, it's just so they can say they gave you a card with the camera). I bought the bullet proof case for ten bucks or so and it will fit the camera and extra cards and batteries and is good enough while keeping the size small.<br /><br />I don't see how you could go wrong with this camera.","I was looking for a digicam with ultra zoom that I could basically use for point and shoot purposes along with video.  I went to the Steves-digicams.com website and found this in the category of \"best of\" under the super zoom cameras.  Turned out this was the smallest size brand of zoom cams and was actually under $300 at another reputable online store.  I decided to give it a try and figured that Olympus specializes in cameras so it shouldn't be too bad.<br /><br />At first, I couldn't believe the camera was so small.  When I started playing around with it, I was pleasantly surprised that the video function lasted more than the usual 3 minute limit that most other cameras have.  I tested it up to 5 min then turned it off.  I also was happpy with the zoom and the pop-up flash.  Often, I take it to b-ball games and other events and don't want the flash accidentally going off.  Picture quality outside is great but inside, its a bit suspect.  But I'm not really anal about all my shots.  The shot-taking speed is a bit slower than the Canon A75 I used and that is a bit annoying but its ok.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a great zoom camera thats smaller than any other, is a good value, and is versatile then get this camera.","I really like this camera.  The biggest bonus to the camera is how adaptable it is. If you are a novice, it can be used as a simple point-and-shoot camera, and it has several scene selections (portrait, landscape, sport, night, etc.).  If you are a more advanced user, this camera is great too.  It has several levels of customizability:  choose one function and allow the camera to determine the rest, or you can select ALL the settings yourself.<br /><br />The camera has threads on the lens, so it is essentially upgradeable, with more advanced telephoto (not that you need it with a 10X optical zoom built in), macro and other lens attachments available through Olympus.  Or you could attach filters.  It is as close as you can get to an SLR without paying an arm and a leg.<br /><br />The C-765UZ has an electronic viewfinder.  Many people don't like EVFs, but I love it.  I have some visual difficulties, and sometimes can't really see through an optical viewfinder.  The EVF is very bright and clear.  It is even manageable in low light settings.  It was the brightest EVF of any camera in its class that I tested.<br /><br />Many people may say that the C-765UZ is a little pricey compared to other 10X zoom cameras.  However, those other brands are usually 3MP instead of the 4MP of the C-765UZ.  In addition, the optics on the Olympus C-Series is generally superior to those other camera.  Remember you get what you pay for!!  Plus the C-765 is the SMALLEST 10X optical zoom camera on the market today (Spring 2005).<br /><br />The only complaints I have are with the packaged accessories.  Olympus only provides a 16MB xD card, so you need to add a 256MB card to your initial purchase.  Also, Olympus provides the Li-10B rechargeable battery, but the \"replacement\" 12B battery has a higher capacity.  It would have been nice to get the better battery in the initial bundle.  Oh, and speaking of batteries, the C-765UZ ONLY takes the rechargeable Li-10B/12B batteries, so if your battery is running low you can't just throw in a few AA's to get by until another charge.  It keeps the size and weight down, but trades convenience.","We bought it before Christmas and while it took us some time to get used to it (as this is our first digital camera), we can now say that it is indeed a great camera. It's totally worth its price. It's not great for candid shots due to some lag time, but otherwise it captures beautiful pictures. I didn't think that we really needed the 10X zoom until we went to a graduation ceremony and was able to take great shots despite the distance from the podium. We found that the pictures are less blurry when you rely on the viewfinder rather than the monitor. (I would also recommend saving all of your pictures until you load them on the computer, as the actual detail/quality is not entirely evident when viewed on the camera monitor.) The video quality isn't great, but proved to be a bonus benefit when traveling and catching unique performances.<br /><br />In terms of cons: as mentioned earlier, some lag time compared to a traditional point-and-click; incorrect settings (as the dial is easily turned when taken out of the camera bag - but that's probably just our problem); and short battery life (especially when you use the LCD monitor). I bought an extra battery via Amazon (one of the cheapo kinds) which worked out really well. Also, when you get a larger memory card, make sure to get SanDisk/Olympus instead of Fuji, as the latter does not support the panaromic setting.<br /><br />Finally, as mentioned in a previous review, it is best to print out the manual (double paged) from the CD.<br /><br />Good luck!","I reviewed tons of digital cameras before buying the C765.  I'm glad I did.  This camera is lightweight and small which is what I was looking for.  The 10X zoom is great!  I've gotten clear shots at full zoom w/o a tripod almost every time.  The macro and super macros are awesome.  The pic quality is absolutely incredible.  The battery life is good, using the flash it's going to putter out sooner so I recommend getting a spare.  Recharge on the battery is quick too.  You will need a 256 card right away.  I was worried about the electronic viewfinder, but it's not posed a problem at all.  Most of the 10X zooms, at least all that I reviewed, have EVF's.  I've only had a few problems focusing indoors.  Like all digital cameras there's a minor lag and if your toddler moves as you're taking the pic, you'll get a blurry shot.  This is such a minor problem considering how many great shots I have gotten in and outdoors.  I've had this camera for 6 months now and just love it.  I was able to use it right out of the box.  I still have more to learn about it, but have been having great success w/ the auto settings, I've not needed to play w/ the manual ones yet.  I will!","I cannot express how great this camera is. Not once has it let me down in ease of use, advanced features (when I need them), true color reproduction, contrast, or anything else that makes a picture a \"good\" picture. You just can't beat the 10x OPTICAL zoom -- not lousy digital zoom -- either. Get yourself an extra rechargeable battery, a couple of high-capacity memory cards, and have fun with one of Olympus' best consumer level cameras ever released.","this is a high quality camera with the zoom you need to get those great shots that may not be close enough with a regular digi cam. i don't know that much about cameras nor am i good w/electronics, but this camera is pretty easy to learn - just put in the time to go thru the brief manual and you'll be taking amazing pics immediately thereafter.<br /><br />i haven't been able to learn what aperture is yet or do many of the other features like the camcorder part, but my pictures are absolutely amazing - i've impressed my friends when we went on vacation to jamaica and all my co-workers when i returned home with my \"artistic\" pictures which are just scenic pictures, plain and simple. i needed an easy to use camera (a no brainer) that would take great pictures for me, but that also had incredible zoom for my scenic picture taking compulsion.<br /><br />i've read that the 4 mp is just right for taking pics for the size 8\"x10\" or less which is fine cuz i rarely print pictures - i just send them over the internet to friends and family to share my memories - and of course the file size (2 MBs per pic for quality shots) is perfect for that. the clarity and color richness is stunning to say the least.<br /><br />of course there are much better cameras out there, but there's no need to spend too much $ on something i won't use too much. i felt that if i was going to spend $200-$300 anyhow on a digi cam, might as well get one with the zoom that i want for a lil bit more ($350). this digicam also takes the night pics that i want for a new york nightlife too which gets rid of the red eye, background disappearing, problem i get with a normal 35 mm camera.<br /><br />for the problems that others listed on this review website, they're all workable/recoverable kind of problems. i think there's another review that offers solutions to some of those problems.<br /><br />hope this is of help. good luck w/finding the right one","I have had this camera for a couple of weeks.  It is extremely easy to use in any mode, has a great optical zoom, acheives auto focus almost always, has good flesh tones and color saturation, and it has a truely superior Macro and Super Macro funtion that works extremely well. Even when zoomed in close I haven't had any problems with blur from camera shake.  Even though there is no Image Stabilization feature on this camera. In general this is an excellent camera.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that It didn't come with a wrist strap. Otherwise a superior performer.<br /><br />Experience:  Casio Z4U, Kodak DX7630, Fujifilm E550, Olympus D-580 and now the C-765","just like the rave reviews given, this is a very good camera to have.  the best feature for me is the 10x zoom which just blows away the 3x zoom which other similar priced cameras have.<br /><br />now for the sad part.  if you happen to upgrade to a 512 mb xD card, your battery just won't be able to keep up.  according to olympus the battery can only average 175 shots per charge for typical use. if you're a typical user then you have no problem.  a 512 mb card can manage around 500 shots.  the battery will be dead before you can fill up the memory card.  you'd better buy an extra battery or two especially if you're going on long trips where there are no electrical outlets available.<br /><br />*  if the C765 uses typical AA batteries all you have to do is stock up on those but unfortunately it uses special ones which are expensive.","I've had this camera for about a month now, and it's easy to use and takes great pictures. For people who don't know much about photography, it has point-and-shoot convenience; for those who are more experienced, there are lots of features you can set manually. The pre-set macro mode is great fun--it allows you take some gorgeous extreme close-ups. You do need to keep your hands extremely steady or use a tripod to prevent the picture from being too blurry (using the action shot mode also helps, since the shutter speed is faster). I bought mine for $339, and it's a really good value for the money. The only minor complaint I have is that the propietary XD card is pretty expensive and you need to get the Olympus brand if you want to take panoramic pictures, but I managed to find a 256MB chip for $40, so really I don't have too much to complain about. If you're looking for a decent mid-range digital camera, I highly recommend this one.","I love the small size which provides great portability and it's hard to believe all the great features packed into this little gem of a digital camera.  The zoom lens is a much used feature as is the built in cropping and other editing tools.  You really need to read the instruction manual to get the most out of the camera - after reading it I discovered just how much I was missing!  Although you certainly don't need to read it to be able to use the camera as it's very easy to operate.  I was advised to get at least 3MP for good end results when printing the photos and the 10x optical zoom cannot be beat.  This camera produces extremely clear photos that can be enlarged to 8x10 without loosing clarity.  My belief is that it's not worth spending $150-200 on a digital camera if you end up with grainy photos - just keep your regular camera until you're ready to make an investment for the higher grade camera and if you are ready, I highly recommend this camera.  I know the dollar amount could make this purchase a question mark but it's well worth it!","This is my second digital camera, first one was Olympus C-750 (which I used for abt 1.5 yrs) and after i lost it, I was determined to buy its next version C-765. This camera is simply awesome. It has all the things anyone would want in a  camera: Optical Zoom, Small Compact Size, Great quality pictures & movies with sound, lots of modes & easily customizable, ease of menu and fast pictures.<br /><br />Olympus has decreased the size (compared to C-750 which has same features) mainly by changing from standard 4 AA batteries to small Li battery. They have removed the hot-shoe , which usually slips & fall down. Turbo PicPro helps to take real fast pictures like in football game. (That was my first photo session with this new camera). I have compared my results with other comparable cameras and found this one better than others.<br /><br />Sometimes there could be some problem of focussing at higher zoom, but it can be dealt easily by waiting for a few seconds once you increase the zoom before taking picture. It gives the time for enough light to enter. For better pictures, its aperture and shutter speed can be adjusted as well. Night mode picture quality is good and panoramic quality is really great. For self-timer photos, it gives you about 12 seconds before taking the picture.<br /><br />Overall, I will recommend this to everyone, be it a beginner in digital photography or an enthusiastic like me.<br /><br />Updated: June 14, 2005<br /><br />I have been using it now for about 8 months and have used it in almost all the different geographic locations and at different times e.g. Blizzard in boston, desert and stony terrain, tennis courts at late evenings, football game, capture stage-shows, fireworks, babes at beaches, breakdancing events. I observed that this camera can be customized for almost any condition and it gives the best results. recently someoen asked me to suggest a camera cheaper than this and with approximately same quality in pictures. Frankly, I couldn't find one.<br /><br />Update: July 5, 2006<br />This camera is doing really very impressive job. Apart from doing travel photography for landscapes and cityscapes, I have used for sports events like football games, horseraces and catching fireworks. Results are really impressive. These days, most cameras are in 5-6 MP range and create bulky files, more than 1 MB each. This camera is 4 MP and the file size is 600-800 kb with quality still very good.","I've had this camera for a couple of months and I love it.  The pictures look great and it is very easy to use.  Its big and boxy so it won't fit in a small purse or pocket, but its worth hanging a camera case around your shoulder if you like to take high quality outdoor pictures.","The C765 is my first digital camera after years of shooting pictures with 35mm SLR'S. I've owned the 765 for about 5 months now and have taken hundreds of pictures that range from hummingbirds in flight to floral still lifes. The camera has been an absolute joy to use and the results have been excellent. I take all my pictures at high resolution (2288x1712) and still get almost 300 shots on a 256MB card.","I feel so happy taking pictures with this camera. The 10X optical zoom is critical for the stile of pictures that I like to take: portrait, detailed pictures, lots of deep. Pictures are so good that it reminds me my old SRL film camera that had an 80-380mm zoom. Colors are vivid, details are excellent, supports 512MB media.<br /><br />Flash is OK but I was expecting more of it, the C-770 has better flash.<br /><br />Don't install the software. If you are using Windows XP you won't need the software. It is good for nothing, shame on Olympus!!!. If you don't want to spend more money download one from Internet, ie: free Adobe photoshop album.<br /><br />If you want to have the best pictures, you will need editing software that works well like Photoshop Elements 3 that is the one that I recently bough.<br /><br />My final advice: what ever camera you buy, learn to use it well, study the manual, practice taking lots of pictures. The combo that I have is excellent: C-765 (see also the C-770) and Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.","Very pleased with this camera!Great pictures and so easy to use.I actually first bought an Olympus d-560.I HATED it!I actually GAVE it away!I had problems loading the software to my computer.....Trigger from Augusta","We recently purchased the C-755, which is essentially the same camera as the 765, it just came from a different store, thus a different model number.  Costco.com had a great deal and we decided to go for it and replace our old digital cameras with this one.  I haven't had a chance to learn EVERYTHING as there are many many features available, but it has been wonderful so far.  When using the auto feature, it takes beautiful pictures and the quality is top notch.<br /><br />There are two things, both related to the flash, that caused me to rate it a 4 rather than a 5 (and I'd go 4.5, if I had the choice available to me).  First, if you don't remember to put the flash up manually, there is no flash.  Of course this is a good thing when you don't want the flash accidentally going off like in a museum!  The second thing is that when you use the auto function you cannot force the flash ON manually.  When it says AUTO, it means AUTO.  There are so many features like the ability to program personal settings to be accessed later and the ability to use it for short video that are awesome and the zoom is amazing for a camera at this price.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera!<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  This camera requires the X-D memory chips which is newer technology, thus a little pricey.  We were disappointed that the chips for our old Olympus digital would not work.  We purchased a new chip at Costco for around $70 and it holds over 200 pictures.  Sorry I forgot to mention this initially.  It's still a great camera and the chips are likely to come down in cost as time passes.<br /><br />In addition, I had no difficulties loading the software into my Sony Vaio Computer.  It was quick and painless and all I have to do is plug the cord from the camera into my USB port and the software starts right up.  It asks me what I want to do and I can quickly download my pictures.","I've had this camera for about 3 months, and I love it.  There are a bunch of professional review websites up(dcresource.com), so if you want to know all about this camera, then go there.  As far as an amateur/for fun review, then I have to give it 4 stars.  I would give it 5 but I must say that in low light situations, it's sometimes hard to get the camera to focus.  But, the overall ease of use and picture quality of this camera is great.  The only other camera I even thought of getting was the Cannon S1, but didn't like the 3 megapixels and the fact that the camera would not focus correctly at max zoom....(verified this fact by playing with one at my local camera store...If cannon would only fix this little problem...then I will get the next generation of this superb camera).  Great little introductory camera for those of us with little knowledge of picture taking.","Wow! This camera does everything I expect from it and more. I've had it about a month, now, and I'm very impressed with the results. The aperture and shutter priority shooting modes enable capture of any scene. Sharpness and color rendition is outstanding. Flash results are excellent. Movies are superb. I used it for movies at the Seattle aquarium in a darkened exhibit last week and the results were perfect.","I replace my old Olympus 450 with this camera. I loved the old camera but it did not have all the features that I wanted. The new camera is great. It takes great pictures out of the box. If you spend the time to get to know all the features it takes even better pictures. I love being able to customize the settings. The zoom is the best feature of the camera. Allows you to get very close to your subject. Battery life is great but I would buy an extra battery because it does not give much warning when it is going.","Other than a cheap point and shoot camera, this is the first real camera that I have owned. I decided to go with a digital camera that way I would practice my photography skills without wasting a whole lot of money on film. Overall, I have been very impressed with this camera. I recently got back from a trip to London and everyone was very impressed with the pictures that I got. For the beginner, you can set the camera on Auto Mode on and get great shots. For the more advanced photographer, the camera offers enough creative control over things such as aperature and shutter speed. I experimented with the camera in the Sport Mode and was able to freeze an acrobat in the middle of a flip. This camera is not for a professional, but for the beginner to an intermediately advanced photographer, it makes a great camera. My only real complaint with the camera is shooting pictures at night or extremely low light situations is somewhat difficult. I recommend using a tripod or some other way to stabilize it for best results. It is possible that there is something that I haven't figured out yet since I feel like I am still learning a lot about this camera. Other than this though, I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a solid, reliable camera that takes excellent photos.","I just got this camera.  I love it.  It takes excellent pictures and is easy to use.","I just purchased this camera and love it.  Prior to getting this one, I had been using my Olympus Camedia 3030.  This one has several things that really make it better than the old one:<br />First and foremost, it has the 10x optical zoom.  I often found with the C-3030 that I couldn't get close enough in on people and animals if they were more than about 20 feet away.  This one solves that problem.<br />Second, the lag time from pressing the button to the shutter releasing is significantly reduced in this camera.  I can actually capture my son before he has left the picture frame.  It still isn't as fast as an SLR, but it is light years ahead of where it used to be.<br />Third, I have noticed significantly fewer red eye issues with this camera.  This is a big deal for me since everyone in my family is fair skinned with blue eyes.<br />Last, the battery is a Li rechargeable.  It only takes about two hours to get a full charge.  Picture quality is exceptional.  I haven't had any problems with the zoom lens (but I do try to steady the camera on a fence or something if the zoom is fully extended).<br />All in all, I think this is a great camera.  Admittedly, I don't use all the bell and whistles -- mostly the automatic settings.  Oh, and one other thing I like -- it is easier to control the flash with this one since you have to open it to use it.<br />A Few Cons: It may be overpriced compared to the competition.  The battery and charger come with the camera, but a spare battery costs approx. $50.00 (and you can't use AA's in a pinch).  You'll definitely need to buy a 256MB card right away.  The one that comes with the camera only holds about 16 pictures.  The digital display window can not be adjusted or turned -- so it is hard to preview your images in some bright light situations."]},{"name":"Samsung Digimax 530","amazon_reviews":["SMALLER SCREEN THAT i EXPECTED","I have owed this very camera since 1996 and it's still today giving me GREAT service even after taking a few hits out in the field with me<br />like dropped down a metal stair case at about 12 feet and bounced all the way down !!!

I like it.","I got this camera for my birthday and for a cheap camera it has the best picture. My mom bought an extra 128 memory card so my  camera took 10 minutes of video and 100 pictures. I think the camera is a really good one. When you switch the camera to heart mode, whenever you take a picture it has pretty designs. When you hook the camera up to your computer the camera has sound on the video mode but when you play it back on the camera, it will have no sound. I would recommend this camera.","Pros: compact, excellent price, great pictures, easy-use, 16 Mb built-in memory and produces video with sound<br />Cons: no optical zoom (not a big deal)<br />After a long search and try-outs of 3.0 MP digital cameras from reputable brand names, I found DIGIMAX 301 from SAMSUNG an excellent acquisition. I bought it from WalMart (near $ 118 bucks), a great price for a really nice camera. I have seen some notes from previous non-satisfied reviewers on the Internet, but I found later their complains are unreasonable and incoherent. Then I decided to write this review.<br />USABILITY: The manual is very well written, full of figures and diagrams. You can get the basics right away. You can download the manual written in several other languages (which was very helpful for my in-laws). Once you set the camera according to your desired settings, it is just a matter of \"point and shoot\". My in-laws (old guys and obsolete regarding modern technology) went out on the second day after I purchased this camera, and they took nice shots and movie clips. If they can do it, you will do it as a master. The camera has a macro function that takes very close shots. This function is enabled/disabled by a lateral switch. Indeed, once I forgot to disable it, and I got blurry pictures of long-range shots. But this was my fault, and I could realize it right away. Some previous reviewers said they got unfocussed photos, and this is the probable cause of their frustration.<br />PICTURE QUALITY: So far I got excellent pictures considering it is a 3.2 MP camera. Day light, close shots, night shots with and without flash, all them are just perfect. The best way to prove this is to show some of my photos, [...] (note that some of them are really large files, i.e. up to 1 Mb size). The flash works fine, it does not produce overexposed close shots, neither underexposed long-range (up to 10 feet) shots. With a tripod you can get nice night shots without the flash, and best of all they come out clear, no grains and with nice resolution.<br />SHUTTER LAG: The camera initially shoots with less than 2 seconds, then it takes 6-7 seconds to be ready for the next shoot if you are using flash, the maximum resolution, and if you set the camera to preview the shot image. If you remove this last feature and set the camera to take normal resolution pictures without flash you can drop the shutter lag down to a fewer seconds. Note that if you use low quality batteries the shutter lag dramatically increase, since the batteries will not be able to deliver power to the flash right away (an usual problem of all digital cameras). Consider using rechargeable batteries with capacities above 2000 mAh, and you will have fewer problems with shutter lag.<br />BATTERY LIFE: I have not found any digital camera that does not efficiently consume battery. If you frequently use flash and the LCD screen, then you probably will wear out your batteries very fast. Once again, this is a common problem of all kinds of digital cameras. I bought an inexpensive charger along with four Ni-MH batteries (about $ 10 bucks), and they do their job nicely.<br />EXTRA FEATURES: There is the option to downgrade the resolution of your photographs, which is nice in case you want to send pictures to you friends over the Internet, who uses dial-up connections (small files). You do not need to buy an expensive memory card if you are able to print the pictures at home. With 16 Mb built-in memory you can take about 36 photographs with right-resolution and normal pixel definition. Using such settings, I could print perfect 8x10 (letter size) photographs, no grains and no low pixel definition. If you want improve the pixel definition (to ultrafine), you can store up to 12 photos, but the gain is just a little. To download the pictures to my PC is easy as drag-and-drop. If you are not able to do this, just buy a SD card and develop your pictures at a local department store (you can get a generic 128 Mb for $ 25.00 on WEB stores). The camera software has a PRINT function that will help a lot the not-friendly PC users. Finally, I forgot to mention, you might use your camera as a simple recorder.","I was wondering how this canera would look being it said it was used. But when we got it, it was in NEW condition.

We are returning the camera for a refund because of this problem.<br /><br />2 The Digimax 430  takes only  two AA batteries, when it should probably have been designed to take 4 AA batteries - so the battery life is rather short (particularly in video mode) We were using only the regular 'Duracell' Alkaline batterys for all out photo tests - So you may be able to do better with a longer lasting type.<br /><br />Good Points:<br /><br />In all fairness, the outdoor shots were very good - stills & video.<br /><br />The craftsmanship and design of the camera body is very good.<br /><br />The optical zoom worked well and was clear and in focus.<br /><br />The video mode worked  real good - but did drain the batteries a bit faster.<br /><br />The sound and mike pickup was remarkably good(using video) for such a small camera.<br /><br />The Menu and controls are easy to use and well thought out.<br /><br />The Camera case is nice and also has some soft padding.<br /><br />The packing, manual, software and cables were satisfactory.(Separate manuals, one in English, other foreign)<br /><br />Summery:<br /><br />Good for outside pictures and video - nice design, very small size - not the best for indoor use.","I must say I never would have bought this camera had it not been on sale, but I am so glad I did.  Not only does it take really great pictures but it also records video with sound.  How many $200 dollar digital cameras do that.  We have not so great lighting in our house and my previous digital camera a Cannon did a terrible job with indoor pictures, but this one does so well, I have yet to have a picture that was too dark.  Anyway, I am very pleased with my purchase so far.","i just bought this camera yesterday, and so far i am surprised a the quality of it.  it does video clips, expandable with greater memory, has a flash, which some do not do, has many function usually available with only more expensive cameras. it can use two differant types of media and does well in low light.","I bought this camera #1, for the price.  I have been an avid film SLR user for many years.  I must say I was very skeptical about buying a digital point and shoot camera.  Let me explain why I bought it.  My father, who lives 2 hours away, was recently diagnosed with cancer, and has not been able to see our 2 week old newborn son.  We also have a 3 year old son.  When I found this camera, at such a low price, I figured I would give it a try, and if I didn't like it, I would simply return it.  I took a few test shots inside and outside, under different lighting conditions, and took them to my local Target and had 4x6 prints made to see how well they turned out.  I must honestly say that both my husband and I were truly impressed and surprised at the quality of the prints we received back.  They were very true to life, and the colors and the clarity were outstanding from this little 4 mp camera.  I am also happy with the fact that this camera can shoot short videos WITH SOUND, which can be very hard to find in this price range.  Now I can send my family updated pictures, daily, of our children, as well as short videos.  I would recommend this camera to anyone!"]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P93","amazon_reviews":["great when youg, about to replace","This is one of the first digital cameras of this size I've used, and I'm totally satisfied with the performance.","I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOTHER ON CHRISTMAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

Over the past 5 years, until recent months, this has been a great starter camera for me.

I have always taken care of my camera, so I'm not sure how to explain the why, but within the past 6 months it will shut down in picture-taking modes, when there is still enough battery power.  If it doesn't shut down after attempting to take a picture, it will turn on when powered on, the lens will extend, then the camera will die.  I have attempted recharging the batteries, changing the batteries altogether, and every time whichever batteries are in, as soon as they are 50% exhausted, the camera fails, which was really frustrating on my honeymoon.","The quality of the photos produced by this camera is outstanding. Absolutely no trace of purple fringing on high-contrast scenes. No jpeg artifacts to hide the details. Most of the 5 megapixel cameras I have used produce photos that look good when they're reduced to 1280x1024 pixels or so, but when you look at them in full resolution you see blurriness in the details, or fringing around objects. There is absolutely none of that with this camera.<br /><br />Add to that the ease of use and the wealth of exposure controls (full auto, shutter and aperture priority auto, and complete manual, along with a few programmed modes).

At first, I was in love with it.  The size is perfect - it fits into my purse or pocket.  It has 5.1 megapixels - which will print beautiful 8x10 pictures.  I use this camera to take short videos, and they upload onto the computer and can be sent out in email.<br /><br />Lately, after having the camera for over a year, I've noticed the quality of the pictures going down.  I no longer use this camera indoors - I find that it doesn't pick up the light, and leaves the picture with almost a grayish tone to it.  I also have a Fuji FinePix camera, and I recently took the same shot with both cameras and I can really see the difference.<br /><br />All in all, this camera does good outdoor pictures, but I am glad I did not buy it because the indoor quality of the pictures is poor.  I would look elsewhere for a camera if you are into photography and want the best quality picture.","First, I would like to say that this is a good bargain, and you will most likely get tons of use out of this camera. The picture quality is very good, the battery life impressed me, and there are a lot of features that will allow you to take the very best pictures in all lighting conditions. The LCD screen is large enough to see your pictures on, and is accurate in showing the quality of your pictures.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this camera is the size/weight. It is a little heavy, and can be bulky if you need to carry it around for a while. But if you want a small camera, be willing to pay more, or you're probably going to lose out on some of the features (and quality) included here.<br /><br />This camera is a very good deal, and would be an excellent choice whether you are buying your first digital camera, or replacing an older one.","I have had this camera for over a year. Everyone comments on the wonderful pictures I get from it. It has alot of options and I do admit I don't know all of them yet.The quality is outstanding though. I have compared my images with family members who have Kodak, HP and Vivitar cameras. They are far better. The screen is also much clearer for viewing shots. It lets you know if the light is bad or your just too close.I love that it takes video too with sound (an option not on the others). I don't use my video camera as much since it is so easy to put these clips onto video tapes/Cd's. Its much more convenient to grab when the little was is doing something too cute not to record.The best place I have found to upload and have prints made (that last) is Winkflash.com. Its a great service. Very fast. The best prints too with the best price.If you want professional looking photos this is your camera. You can even make poster size prints with beautiful details. I also love how it comes with the rechargeable batteries and charger.Its all around one of the best for the money.","PROS: Just place the dial on it's \"camera\" icon setting and you are ready to go.  There is no guesswork here if you just want to take quick pictures.  I did not read the manual until I wanted specific results or had special situations.  You can download drivers, etc. from Sony's site and hook the camera up to your computer through a usb cable.  Very easy.  The batteries last a very long time for me.  Though it has automatic shut-off, it probably depends on how long you keep the camera on trying to figure things out (read the manual first)...or if you leave it on and forget when you have it hooked up to the computer, but if you stay aware of these things you should have excellent battery life.  CONS: Two complaints, and they are the same for any digital camera that I've tried or heard about: I want instant capture when I press that button (like a 35mm), not a three second wait, which is a long time when you're trying to capture children, wildlife, or sports. Also, the color of ordered prints is slightly off 80% of the time.  I don't have time to tweak coloring in hundreds of pictures.  CONCLUSION: However, the pictures are sharp and I can take as many pictures as I want and ease of use is high. The video is nifty too. OVERALL I am happy with this camera.","I bought my Sony DSC P93 in Feb 2004. Its been 2 years now and never had any complains about anything. I have the same Original Rechargeable batteries going strong. I have compared the picture quality with some of the Sony's latest ones but they are not that great. If I have to buy a camera today again I will buy Sony DSC P93.","help ... the book says nothing about this:<br /><br />I set my cybershot to the fine, and the 5m setting (largest) but when i go in to photoshop to \"play\" with my images it shows me a very large image 35\" x 27\" but only a resolution of 72; i see jagged edges that i think i should not see with a 5.1 megapixel camera.<br /><br />when i \"resample\" the image and lower size to 8\" x 10\" the resolution goes up but the image stays the same.<br /><br />how do i take a high rez image (300 dpi)not just a large image?","I had to replace my Olympus D-550. It was difficult to make a decision as I had loved the Olympus, but I dropped it on the floor and it was broken. The decision to buy a Sony stemmed from owning rechargable AA batteries and my dad owning a sony memory stick already for an older Sony Mavica.<br /><br />I have had nothing but great pictures with this camera, unless I moved.  Batteries last a long time but the included charger and batteries would have been a better deal if it charged more than two AA batteries at a time.<br /><br />The manual is very easy to follow; there are alot of features in this camera so I refer to it every once in a while to refresh my memory. I mostly use it outdoors with children in my day care in very bright conditions or in florescent lighting and all the pictures are great.<br /><br />I download using the USB cable and Windows XP camera wizard. I only installed the basic software to run the camera, because all the other software is useless.  It doesn't edit the pictures, so I actually edit them on Camedia. I know some people don't like that software either, but on the whole it is easy to use and works well.<br /><br />You won't be sorry if you buy this camera. It is small enough to go anywhere, and will do the job.  Unless you want the semi-pro models to change lenses, this is one of the best cameras I've ever owned.","After owning 2 Canon cameras over the last 6 years, I knew for my new one I did not want a proprietary battery format again. This Sony is great, and it uses AA batteries! I rotate between the pair of recharbles it came with and 4 more rechargables I bought. Highly recommend. The pictures and videos are very good. Also, the video clips aren't limited to any amount of time, only by your memory.","I just need to rave about this camera.  I loved it from day one it is easy to use and has so many options.  It is also a great price.  The thing that has completely shocked me and amazed me is that my camera was accidently taken outside and left outside by a younger sibling of mine and it still works.  He thought it would be funny to bury it in the snow this past winter.  I had on clue where it was it sat outside buried in snow for at least a week and then when I finally found it the snow had all melted so it went through a lot.  Never in my dreams did I think that this camera would still work.  I took out the batteries replaced them with fresh batteries and took out the memory card and replaced it with the same memory card.  Hit the on switch and it turned on!  I've been using it ever since with absolutely no problems.  So if you want a camera that will take a beating with lots of options and that is easy to use this is the one for you!","Great Camera! Compact, Sturdy, FUN. Accessories are easy to find.<br /><br />Use is pretty intuitive, right out of the box. Uploading pictures to the PC is quick and EASY. Resolution is outstanding!<br /><br />There are so many \"fun\" features: including (but NOT limited to) black and white, snapshot video, ability to hook it to the TV to see it on a big screen...<br /><br />The quick snapshot is VERY handy when capturing \"fast-action\" shots (like our toddlers)!<br /><br />Highly Recommend! (I LOVE IT!!!)","This is my first digital camera purchase, so i was a bit worried about getting a dud with so many to choose from. i was looking for one that would allow me to indulge in a hobby of picture  taking but not bust my budget. all the other reviews have really gone over the pros and cons of the camera, and i really agree with it all. the macro mode works good, the multi burst mode at first wasen't a real big selling point but i got playing with it and i really like it, i didn't understand reading about it that it take multiple pictures with one press of the button, giving it a slow motion effect, the individule pictures are smaller in size (640 X 400 it looks like) but cool none the less. the movie mode is sweet, yes it would really be great to have a stabilizing system but it give good movies with good sound quality. the zoom works great, but as with all cameras in this price range it would be nice to have more than a 3x zoom, digital zoom hasn't been all that amazing. someone said the photo quality wasnt that great, maybe he's some expert (yeah right) but the quality is better than my freinds 3 and 4 MP cameras. the batteries have lasted pretty well but definetly keep a pair on hand. i ordered a 256mb Pro memorey card the next day from sandisk because the 32 just dosent cut it and i want to record the hi-res movies. the only real con i have about the camera is a lack of any photo editing software. guess I'll have to look for some software. i also bought a $5 camera bag too. over all for a single guy who wanted a good camera to take hiking and camping and to get some family shots too, I'm really happy with it. i give it five because it really dosent have any major defect for the price, features and ease of use (oh yeah i love the easy interface and button set up)","That multi-point focus always seems to focus on someone's shirt buttons...switched to the setting that has the picture of two people on it...even for one person...and that corrected it.<br /><br />This is my second Cybershot.  I purchased this one in May 2004 as a replacement for my first one, a DSCP7 whose PC Card blew at 13 months (so out of warranty) and it was cheaper to by a new one! I like Sony products, but if something similar happens with this camera where I have to have major work done on it, I'll go to another brand.","This was my first digital camera, so my perspective is probably a bit prejudiced by my inexperience.  Things I like, and dislike, about this camera are:<br /><br />1.  Easy to use.  You point and push the button.  It does the rest.<br /><br />2.  Virtually unlimited storage capacity.  After you buy a decent size memory chip (i.e. 256MB), then you can get up to 98 pictures at full size or 350+ at a moderate size.  The memory chip that comes with this camera (32MB) will only story the following number of pictuers: 5MP = 12, 3MP = 20, 1MP = 50, VGA = 196.<br /><br />3.  Prices vary wildly for memory.  I bought three memory chips and paid between $57 and $37 for the same product at different locations.  Be sure to shop prices on the net before you buy.<br /><br />4.  Slow shutter.  If you are used to 35mm, then get used to blurry pictures while you learn.  It takes a second for the camera to focus and light levels can have a big effect on clarity.  Also, using some type of support (i.e. tripod) can also greatly increase clarity.<br /><br />5.  Eats batteries quickly.  If you use the camera a lot, it will go through the AA batteries quick.  Luckily, they are rechargeable and are not unique to the camera.  Carry extras.<br /><br />6.  Good low light pictures.  Assuming you use a support, and the subject is stationary, you can take great low light pictures.<br /><br />7.  Don't have to wait for film developing.  You can snap away to your hearts content and then delete all the bad ones later.<br /><br />8.  Easily transfers images to your PC.  It's just a couple of clicks with the mouse.<br /><br />Bottom line - It's an easy to use camera that can take beautiful pictures with amazing clarity.  This assumes you have good lighting, a stationary subject, good support and take multiple frames.  If you try to use this like a point and shoot 35mm, then you will get nothing but blurry, out of focus pictures.<br /><br />Glad I bought it, but it's taken me several thousand pictures to figure out how to get shots that will equal my 35mm SLR.","I got this for my mother for Christmas and she's taken about a thousand photos with it.<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />-SOLID build quality<br /><br />-Quick start-up time<br /><br />-Focus-assist lamp for GREAT low light shots<br /><br />-Killer MPEG movie mode with high framerates and sound<br /><br />-Power miser...the included batteries last for hundreds of shots.<br /><br />-Easy-to-use USB connection.  Treats the camera like a drive!<br /><br />What I REALLY Like:<br /><br />-Great photo quality for a common level camera.<br /><br />Accessories I'd Recommend:<br /><br />-At least a 256MB Memory Stick PRO.  You want the PRO version so you can get the high quality movies.<br /><br />-A SanDisk Memory Stick PRO reader...so you can just slot the memory stick in the USB reader and treat the card like a regular drive while saving battery power.<br /><br />-The rapid recharge and case kit....a good deal because you get 2 extra batteries and a rapid charger and a Memory Stick case.<br /><br />I like my mom's new camera so much that my next camera will DEFINITELY be a Sony!  Prolly the P150...","The title sums up what I find to be the most descriptive way to define the Sony DSCP93 Cybershot. The pictures are crisp and can be huge allowing you to reduce the size if you want to without compromising photo quality. The lens extends and retracts very fast and taking a photo is very quick. The flash is a bit weak but if you buy the optional flash it will be pretty much more \"professional\". Pictures taken in the dark are a bit hard to line up but this happens with other cameras also.<br /><br />I laugh when I see a thousand cameras at a game all flaring their puny flashes at figures over 50 feet away...hehehe. The camera's aperture can be changed easily allowing shots in darker settings -like fireworks. This camera can be a simple point and click or used with foresight.<br /><br />It took less than ten minutes to plug the included usb connector line into the computer, insert the disk with the driver on it and download the pictures directly into windows xp home version for viewing, storage or editing.<br /><br />Some reviewers here and elsewhere often hold every item to a standard set by Hollywood or by comparing to a fully professional unit. Remember that this is a comsumer camera and it is better than many professional units available in the past. Wonderful photos were taken on tintypes and their resoloution was not all that great..<br /><br />Good photos are in the EYE of the picture taker and the camera should help them realise their goal of capturing what the photographer sees. This Cybershot allows me to take marvelous pictures and the added bonus of video is really a plus-especially for web applications. If you want a solid camera with a small profile and ease of handling, several features not seen in many digital cameras under 400$ and add on options like a water proof housing,telephoto lenses and wide angle lens, get this. We did and it is a real beauty!","This camera is fully loaded with features, and if you are the kind of person that is atracted to change settings for each possible lighting, atmosferic, focussing, and so on conditions for each pic you take, this camera is made for you.<br /><br />If you just want a point and shoot camera (like me) this will also do, but you have to be prepared for the hundred and more pages of instructions and the \"easy\" menus within menus that lead to menus... be patient, practice a lot before the real thing, and you'll enjoy the thingy.<br /><br />...amazing video quality, just like Hi8 (buy an 1Gb stick for 45 mins of recording), excellent picture quality, excellente battery life...","I enjoyed by taking many pictures with this camera. This is my first camera, so i feel that i took the right decision.","Pros: Compact design, very handy, powers on really quick, takes only 2 AA size batt.<br />Extremely good value for the money-less than 270$ total in one of the online stores (jan/05)<br /><br />Cons: None so far. But it is made in China, My previous camera - Sony DSCP5 was made in Japan! but it is a matter of trust in quality of labor, I guess...<br /><br />Several things if you considering buying this camera:<br />1. To take advantage of shooting movies in Fine mode you need Memory Stick PRO - buy min 512 MB (approx. 85$ on ebay -as of Jan/05) don't settle for a smaller ones, you will buy bigger sooner ot later.<br />2. Invest some extra money in spare NiMH batteries - I got 8 batt + international 1hour charger for 21$ on ebay - I am NOT going to run out of battery power anytime soon :)<br />3. Do not take it out without a case!<br />4. A small tripod (less than 5$ on ebay) allows you to be on your own pictures :)<br />5. Plenty of shooting modes: several preprogrammed, one complete manual (makes you feel like you own a SLR camera) and one total auto - even a toddler can make a picture<br />6. Setup allows you to create folders on MStick and switch between them (as you take the pictures) - pictures are organized before transferring to your PC<br />7. Upgradeable - You can buy e.g. telephoto lens or underwater shooting case<br />8. The only difference between Sony MStick and other brands (SanDisk) is the price !<br />9. It has 1.5\" LCD - the price for being so compact - you need to be comfortable with such a size. If you need strong glasses for reading, look for another model :) Larger LCD usually means bulky camera or extremely costly compact. Larger LCD is also easier to damage...<br />10. Included A/V cable allows you to see the pictures/movies on your TV - GREAT feature!<br />11. Do read the manual, read it also again after you know the basics, you will find something new every time...<br />12. In my opinion perfect camera for everyday use.<br /><br />Good Luck! Hope it helps...","This is my first digital camera and all i can say is......... Wow what a camera! I have had this camera for about 2 weeks and taken soooooo many high quality pictures. Fair amount of standard memory. The video recording mode is OK. Better to make it 160 than 640 standard so u can hold more video. I love the options of memory sticks.","I have purchased Kodak, Fujifilm, and Olympus digital cameras all above 4.0 megapixels within a year and this Sony is far better than any of them.  The Kodak and Fujifilm had red eye in just about every picture in the light or dark and neither took a good crisp picture.  This Sony Cybershot takes excellent clear pictures with NO red eye!  In a low to no light setting a red light is seen on your subject before the picture is captured, which adjusts their eyes for the no red eye and it helps you to see the subject.  This camera is much faster than the others I've tried, I can't say enough about it...this is a great camera!<br />PS  I did not write the below about no voting buttons?","I think that this ia an ok camera - If this is your first camera you may not know any better and you will be happy but there are some definite problems!<br /><br />First pros - It does take pictures and they are nice enough. It is Also small and compact which is great for travel. and if you really need a 5 mega pixel this is a great price. Cons- ifyou need a fast shutter speed for small kids that do things in a blink of an eye there are other camera out there that will do the job better. I can take almost 2 pics with my other camera before this one is ready after taking the first picture. I am not real pleased with the picture quality it blurs around the edges I have taken better pics with my other camera. Also probably not real important but I do not like the how images look on the LCD screen it is kind of distracting.","If there are disadvantages to having the casing made of plastic, I don't know what they are. This is a wonderful camera at 5 megs for the price. You can shoot in black + white, and sepia formats. About the only minus is the too-small lcd viewfinder display on the back. That's about the only drawback I've encountered. Great value and performace...so far.","This is my first digital camera.  I went with a 5.1 megapixel because I wanted the flexibility of printing larger photos if I ever wanted to.  I never have, but hey, you never know.  A few observations so far:<br /><br />I've heard bad things about digital zoom in terms of quality.  If you take pictures at the highest setting (5.1 megapixels), the digital zoom feature isn't available, so you don't have to worry about possibly pixelated pictures.  However, at lower settings (3 megapixel for example), the zoom bar shows a green line signifying when digital zoom is being used.  Yes, you can turn off digital zoom, but with this camera, you can keep it on and see when you are in digital zoom.<br /><br />I thought the battery life was weak, but it's actually pretty good.  A friend bought another brand of digital camera and complained that after taking just one picture, the battery would drain.  He found out that the batteries that shipped with his camera were cheap and underpowered and he had to buy a better battery.  The batteries with this camera are fine.  I thought the batteries were draining, but I was looking at the memory stick indicator (gimme a break, I said it was my first digital camera).<br /><br />Video capture is ok, especially for a camera.  I've only used the 32 MB stick that comes with the camera, and I've been able to capture the \"video mail\" size which is very small, but easy to send in an email, and the 640 size, which is better, but still a little choppy.  As I understand it, the Pro memory sticks enable you to capture at the \"Fine\" setting, which is supposed to be better.  I have still found it suitable to capture those humorous moments in video.<br /><br />The flash is very bright.  I took a picture where I couldn't even see anything on the LCD screen, and the flash was bright enough to make it look like the lights were on.<br /><br />I was able to view the pictures I took on my TV without any problems, using the cable that came with the camera.  I was also able to view the videos I took, and the videos do have sound.<br /><br />The camera also has sound when turning on, taking a picture, and navigating the menus.  They're not annoying, and actually are nice as confirmation for changing a setting (and when taking a picture, you get that shutter sound like on an old-fashioned camera).  It also has a volume control and plays back the sound when reviewing video on the camera.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great purchase, especially for my first digital camera.  It fits in a jacket pocket nicely, and has great features (I haven't even got through the manual, but it's easy enough to use without going thorough the whole thing).  One more note--it takes 6 hours to charge the batteries when you first get it (a battery charger is included).","I bought this camera and I have no regrets. It works very well taking pictures even at low-res (standard mode). Works fine with low light conditions and also has a powerful flash. The video capture feature works better when using a 512 MB memory stick which I also bought at amazon. With the 32 MB memory stick that comes with the camera you can't do many regarding video. The digital zoom works excellent, but only in standard mode. Pictures are taken without becoming blurry, except in manual mode where an indicator tells you that the camera is moving.<br /><br />The only negative thing is that two weeks after I purchased it, a white pixel appeared on the LCD screen, it's very very small and after a while it becomes unnoticeable. On the manual it says that it's a normal behaviour and that this can happen.<br /><br />100% Great camera!","This camera has all the features I've wanted in a digital camera and is easy to learn. There was only one disappointment. I was hoping to be able to place the memory stick into my Sony PDA and view the pictures there but alas it turns out not the case. My Palm  JPG viewer was not able to access the photos on the MS. You'd think Sony products would have some compatibility here. I do recommend you get a larger memory stick.","This is my second digital camera, and I must confess that it a great one.<br /><br />I received this camera 2 days back and it was defective. The camera's lens wouldn't come out and I got it replaced with another one from Amazon. Amazon did a great job by sending the replacement in two days time.<br /><br />The resolution is awesome and loaded great many features. Particularly, I liked the \"live histogram display\".<br /><br />The thing I did not like about this camera is the \"Plastic Casing\".<br /><br />As of 12/29/05.<br />Then I lost the flash bulb too. Sony is asking $171 for the repair.. What a waste!!","I waited and waited a long time before I finally bought a digital camera for my wife and I'm glad that I did. Although this not the smallest camera (Casio has several good small models), I like it for several reasons.<br /><br />1. I have the larger DSC-F828 and very happy with Sony's line of cameras. The DSCP93 uses memory sticks just like the larger camera so no extra media to buy.<br /><br />2. This is a 5 megapixel camera so whatever pictures I take will look good even at 8x10.<br /><br />3. It's a decent size, not too large and not too small. The button placement is good. I had a camera where a function button was placed near the right thumb rest. I kept activating buttons that I did not need to.<br /><br />4. It has many features like movie taking and sharpness control.<br /><br />5. It has an optical viewfinder to save on battery life. I use the digital viewfinder for picture review.<br /><br />6. Talking about batteries: It gets a long life out of two \"AA\" rechargeable batteries, which came with it. Although you do have to use an external charger for these batteries it's fine since you don't have to worry about down time while the batteries charge like you would if the batteries were charged internally.<br /><br />7. The batteries are standard nickel metal hydride and relatively cheap and available anywhere, not expensive batteries designed just for this camera.<br /><br />8. Very important! When you change batteries, you do not lose your settings like the date and time.<br /><br />9. There is a built-in lens cover.<br /><br />10. Flash is bright and recharges relatively quickly.<br /><br />11. The telephoto is optical rather than digital.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with it. I do hate Sony's 90-day labor and 1 year parts warrranty though.","The good sides of the p93 camera need no further comment. The camera really produces nice pictures (and use of the maximum pixels  is certainly strongly advised) and videos. Using a tripod, one can look 'into the night' to a sufficient extent. The only bad thing that needs to be mentioned concerns the stubborn Sony strategy on the whole rather than this digi camera. The memory stick memory card is very slow compared to other cards. The camera does not support uncompressed formats, and I've heard that taking a tiff picture with the next model (the dsc-p100) is very time-consuming. Manual settings can be adjusted easily, and this is very good because the light that comes from the built-in flash is nearly as bright as the natural lightning - too much for the subject not to close his eyes at night.","A long-time SLR user, I was concerned that a digital camera would not satsfy my photography needs, since the only digital camera I have ever had came free with my computer.  I was not sure the convenience of a digital was worth the several hundred dollars this camera cost, but my wife kept nagging me until I bought it.  She was tired of carrying our bulky SLR camera and several roles of film every time we go to Disney.  I must say, she was right and I was wrong!!  This camera takes such excellent pics that I doubt I break out the old dinosaur too many more times!<br /><br />My only complaint is the very large storage size of the 5MP pics.  They look awesome, but you can't email them and can't store too many on your computer unless you have a very large storage disk.  I take hundreds of pics, so over 3MB each is just too large!  At least this camera has the ability to downgrade the size and MP for your everyday pics or pics you want to mail.  It also comes with software to easily transfer images to CD.<br /><br />The video and sound are good except for the fact that it is lacks the anti-vibration feature.  All-in-all, this camera is definitely worth the money!  Just make sure you have plenty of money if you decide to buy accessories--they are very expensive, but at least they are available.","I upgraded from a 2MP fuji to this camera.  This camera has tons more features, obviously.  I also have a D100 nikon slr 6M pixels and this camera quality of picture rivals that.  Of course it cant do the same things a digital SLR can, but I would buy this one again if it were to get stolen or something. It fits in your pocket and buy an off brand memory card for 100 bucks, get 512mb(200 pics at 5 Mp) and you are off.  Also, the movie quality on this camera is decent and the sound pick-up for such a small microphone is excellent.  You need to hold the camera very still since there is no anti-vibration switch.<br /><br />All in all a excellent camera.","This is simply the best digital camera I have ever owned.<br /><br />It takes great pictures, very easy to use with a lot of extra features.<br /><br />My only knocks on it are: Somtimes the camera gets confused how much battery power is left (you have a full bar go down to a half bar and then back up to full), and sometimes getting it to focus on what you want it to focus on is difficult. Digital cameras are not like film cameras in that it takes a few seconds from the time you push the shutter button for the picture to actually be taken. In that respect, I've tried to take some quick pictures of my son doing something only to have the camera take too long and miss the picture.<br /><br />However, these are tremendously outweighed by the pros.<br /><br />I've taken 10 times at least as many pictures as I did before due to the instant gratification of it and highly recommend this camera. It is awesome.","Well, despite the price (it's 499 dollars in my country) this is an excellent camera. If you are a newbie like me with digital cameras, you're starting with a monster.<br />This baby can take beautiful pictures, and offers options never before seen in P series. Manual control is superb.<br />Cons: It needs Memory Stick Pro to save video... agh!","It's my first Digital camera, and I must say, \"It's perfect & worth every penny!\"<br />With its 5.1 MP Sony lens, the photo quality is amazing! Crisp, Sharp, Colorful and very detailed.<br />I have to say, it works better than some CANON models! I took a photo of a same stationary subject with both cameras. I found out that the SONY's output was better than the CANON's. So I went for Sony.<br />The camera has various features to enjoy including Video recording and OPTICAL/DIGITAL Zoom.<br />Well done SONY! :)","I just bought this camera and I have had the best time using it.  It takes wonderful crisp pictures and is easy and fun to use.  It works great in all conditions.  This camera was a great buy at 5 megapixels at a great price...better than other cameras that were more expensive at 4 megapixels with features that an everyday user would not need.","This was the first digital camera I purchased, and I must say that I got quite lucky.<br /> The resolution is brilliant at 5.1 MP. You can stretch and crop all you want without distortion, and it doesn't have that blurry look quintessential of digial cameras.<br />  The price is an excellent bargain, especially since here it is offered for $350 (probably subject to change) as opposed to the list $450.<br />  It is very user friendly, and has many functions to produce the optimum photo for your situation/context. The amount of flash is automatically decided by the camera, making one's life easier, although you do have the power to override flashes.<br />  I recommend that you pruchase the two-sided, 128 MB each memory stick by sony to go along.<br />  My only negative comment would be that the batteries are not the super-power ones found in most other cameras. I don't know much about their chemical composition or any of that, but I do maintain that the batteries have a tendency to run out rather fast. However, they are rechargeable and the camera comes with an included recharger you can plug in to an electrical outlet.<br />  I really suggest you buy this camera. I am certainly glad I did.","As a user of both Canon and Sony Digital cameras in the past, I wanted something that used rechargeable AA's (flexible for travel) with excellent picture quality (barely noticeable picture quality from the Carl Zeiss lenses) and portability (slightly larger than the P100). Also wanted something that good samaritan photographers could use easily and hold adeptly. (this was a problem with my tiny Sony U30)  I have had numerous friends take pictures for me with this picture and the pics have been rock solid with this camera.<br />The  price point is great. Uses Memory sticks which are coming down in price.  Also, the power up time is fast, and the shutter lag is very small.  Flash works great in dark situations.<br />Drawbacks of the camera is that since it's using NIMH AA's there is less battery life than a Li Ion batt. The big bonus is that NiMH batteries are so prevalent.  Also works well with alkaline batteries in a pinch (I tried it out.)  There is also the styling - a tad dated compared with the snazzy new T1's, SD10's, and U40's of the world.<br />In combination with my current U30, the P93 synergistically works as a high-photo quality camera when I don't absolutely have to have the micro camera on me."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P100","amazon_reviews":["I received the product from an honest and generous dealer.","Works well in good shape","I have the same camera that I got when my Mom passed away.

I've travelled a lot during this 3 years w/ my camera and I have nothing to complain about the quality of its images. The only thing that I would consider is its width dimension in comparison to a newer version... also, the display size is much smaller than the newer models. But talking about pictures quality, I have NOTHING to complain about it...it's excellent!!","This camera has more options than any other and with 5.1 is all you need for great 4x6 photos. I took 10,000 photos with last camera like this and ordered this one because the others have NO good options","Our job requires us to take photos almost everyday, so we have tried and worked with many digital cameras in the past years. We bought the DSCP100 like a year ago, and we have been more than pleased with it. The size of the camera is great, the quality of the body is amazing. Battery life is great too. It takes very good pictures, and starts working immediately, so you will not loose that special scene.... Because all of the above, we simply can't stop using the little DSCP100. Sony got it right with this camera !","The Sony dscp100 is such an appealing camera - small, easy to operate - that my shutterbug wife ordered a second one.<br /><br />The reason to order a second one: little black dots began appearing in both viewfinder and photos - in compositions that had a light background such as a sky. So she found a new old-stock model - both have the Zeiss lens - and was happy for a few weeks. Now the second one has the dots. They resemble human eye floaters. Yes; we're sending the seond one back for warranty work.","Reasons to get this camera:<br /><br />-- It is durable (it has a metal frame)<br /><br />-- It should last a long time<br /><br />-- It has a good resolution<br /><br />-- The MPEG Videos are not limited to a particular length<br /><br />-- The videos record sound<br /><br />-- It focuses automatically (easy to use)<br /><br />-- Uploading photos is quick (no tedious software like with Kodak)<br /><br />I gave it five stars because it was nearly perfect.  The one flaw (at least with my camera) is that sometimes the screws fall out.  Fortunately, it is not a serious problem because you can tighten the loose screws, and easily order more from Sony if you lose any of them.","I bought the Sony Cybershot DSCP100 5.1 MP Camera after much researching on the internet about digital cameras because it was my first one.<br /><br />I like the size and shape of the camera. It can easily fit in a small purse or pocket, which is nice for the price.<br /><br />However the pictures turn out blurry unless in bright sunlight or with a flash, where I was previously not used to using one.<br /><br />I also took this camera on a long backpacking trip into the Grand Canyon and it must have gotten bumped, though i don't remember doing such, because now the zoom occassionally has issue coming in and out.<br /><br />Also I did not find the shutter lag to be very quick.","Only one word comment EXCELLENT<br /><br />No Problem after using almost one year.","I bought this two years before. It works great till now. The size is small and easy to operate. If you want to record video using this, the quality is not very good. The picutre's quality is good.","I wanted to love this camera. But in its most automatic modes, a combination of its physical design (lens at the far left of the body) and lack of high shutter speed tends to result in soft/blurred pictures in any but the most glaring of sunlit situations.<br /><br />The 5.1 megapixel capacity and quick start-up is of little use if casual snapshots are ruined by image blur.<br /><br />I've just ordered a Canon Elph to replace the Sony. My first digital camera was a 2.1 megapixel Elph, about 4 years ago. It never suffered from this problem, and I hope its successor performs as well.","This is a good entry level digital camera for those on a budget.  But if you are a hardcore photography junkie then pass up this one.  I bought this camera just for shooting.  Film cameras are a dying breed and I could edit my digital pictures on my computer, not to mention how easy it is to send pics on e-mails.  Well so far I had no problems with the camera, easy to point and shoot.  There are many great features on it, my favorite is the candlelight setting, which makes pictures look soft when taken in a dim room.  Overall this makes a great first digital camera, but for experts, not for you.","I got the P100 (for free using Sony Visa bonus points), as a companion to a three-year-old F707, which is a wonderful camera (at the high end of the non-pro spectrum in its time) but sometimes too big to take on a walk with a toddler.  I was in some ways pleasantly surprised.  In every respect except of taking still pictures, the P100 is better.  That's technological evolution at work: much nicer movie mode (excellent quality of video and sound!), a nicer directional pad/selector, a handy stand-alone delete button, faster picture taking, accepts MS Pro cards, nicer LCD.  Photos aren't as good, especially indoors, but that is to be expected with the tiny lens and small flash of the P100--but tiny is why I got it, so I have no complaints.<br /><br />Outdoor pictures can be excellent.  Indoor pictures can be quite good if one is careful.  As always, some pictures won't come out, but that's my fault as photographer.  I am quite happy--for my purposes, the camera does the job quite well.  It's not going to produce pictures that a high end consumer camera can (the 5MP spec is certainly not everything--the F707 is also a 5MP camera), but if one wants a small camera that one can carry around in a pocket and quickly fire up whenever something picture-worthy shows up, this is a good choice.<br /><br />I particularly like the focusing spotlight, because it lets me know what the camera is pointed at without my having to look at the LCD/viewfinder, which for certain shots is nice.  I wish it came with some sort of a case, but I guess people might want different ones.  (I just use a draw-string little cloth bag that a flash for my F707 came with.)<br /><br />I'd like to address two complaints in other reviews.<br /><br />1. Focus issues.  Some reviewers complain of focusing problems.  My impression is that this is when one is taking pictures in multi-area focus mode, which averages out the data in different areas, and which can ensure that no areas is in focus.  This is the only focus mode available in the easy-shoot mode (the one with the \"camera\" icon).  I tend to switch to the program mode (the one with the \"P\") and set everything on automatic except make the focus be center-area only.  Then I point to the part I want in focus, press the shutter half way, compose the picture, press the shutter all the way.  One really does need to control which part of the picture is to be in focus--no camera can read one's mind!  And outdoor this is a lesser issue because with more light the lens will tend to be stopped up more, and hence have a wider focus range.  My impression is that the focus might still not be perfect in low-light conditions, but I haven't tested this thoroughly.<br /><br />2. Ergonomics.  Out of the box, the camera is hard to hold in one hand when taking landscape-orientation pictures.  For portrait, I think it's fine, and it's fine for landscape with two hands (which one really should use for optimal stability anyway).  For someone like me with big hands, it's easy to cover up part of the flash when holding with one hand, and the weight is inconveniently distributed.  But there is a way of fixing the ergonomics: egrips ([...]  These are very grippy sticky things to keep electronics from sliding out of pockets, etc.  If one applies them in the right places on the camera (I put a strip vertically along the rear right and two horizontally along the front, where the right hand makes contact with the camera), my grip became MUCH surer, and I could hold the camera reasonably comfortably without obscuring the flash.  It seemed worth the ten bucks plus shipping for the egrips, as it fixed the ergonomic issue.  (I have no connection with the people who make the egrips, but they're a good deal, I think.  The camera kit comes with a lot more stickies than one needs for the P100 so there may be enough for some other uses, too.)","I bought this camera last July and could not be more pleased. It is the perfect camera for slipping in your pocket and catching those candid shots thanks to its quick start up. I have taken a lot of very good photos with this camera. Photos I would have otherwise missed.<br /><br />The battery life is great. As long as I don't go nuts with the pictures, I can go days or weeks between recharges.<br /><br /> I am looking forward to taking several more this summer underwater thanks to the newly aquired underwater housing. The great thing is that I will be able to take more photos with this little camera than I could with my old underwater film camera, because thanks to the 2GB memory stick I put in it I can take about 800 pictures at full resolution bofore I have to empty the memory. I bought that memory stick for my PDA but loved having the ability to take so many pictures so much I left it in the camera. (Anybody got a 2GB memory stick they aren't using; those things are pricey.)<br /><br />I plan to buy a digital SLR in the near future but I know that this little camera will still always be in my pocket.","I got this camera to replace my Fuji Finepix 3.2MP camera.  I wanted a camera that I could use to take photos of my pets, and according to many sources, this camera has great red-eye reduction.  Well, when I take pictures of my dogs, they turn out great and the pictures look like they are fresh from a regular film SLR.  However, it's about 50-50 when I take pictures of my Ragdoll kitten.  It may be because he has blue eyes, but for some reason he always ends up getting more red eye than anyone else.  Although this is dissappointing, it is still better than my old camera.  It has a lot more features, some of which I still haven't used.  Another fault of this camera, however, is the fact that in considerably well lit places, if you do not have the flash on, anything that is moving in the picture will be a blur.  This basically forces you to use the flash in all conditions other than extremely well lit places, like the beach.  The LCD screen is very easy to see, and is a lot bigger than the one on my old camera.  Again, how well it works depends on the situation.  In very sunny situations it's IMPOSSIBLE to see the screen.  At least there is a viewfinder to help you out.  The software that comes with the camera is pretty bad, and I can't figure out how to save pictures to my computer.  Much harder to use than that which came with my old camera.  The battery is a plus so far, as that it lasts a very long time compared to my old camera.  Charging it isn't a pain at all.  The memory stick that you must use is a bit of a pain because they are more expensive than a lot of the alternatives that I could have used if it did not require the stick.  The accessories, other than the memory stick, are fairly priced.  The video taking capabilities on this camera are awesome.  Some people have complained about them, but they are SO much better than any I have seen before on a digital camera.  It really helps that I can connect the camera to my TV, using the cables provided by Sony (this is one of my favorite features).  All in all, I do not think that I regret my decision on buying this camera (yet), but I wish that I would have considered other choices that may have had less of a red-eye problem.","After months and months of research, I have finally found a camera that produces sharp, crisp pictures. I haven't even had to edit pictures with software. Just point, shoot, and print.  Of course I have the Epson PictureMate (must have)and no one can believe that a digital camera can produce such high quality images.<br /><br />After reading many reviews from several different websites, I purchased the Canon Powershot Pro S1 IS.  It didn't take long to realize that I wasn't going to get sharp images from that camera.  The images were too soft and had to be edited with software.  I sold it, took a loss, and purchased this fine Sony Camera.  I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />The camera is so easy to use (unlike the Canon), and produces excellent images.  The movie mode is awesome, too.  Takes great movies...you need at least a 1G memory stick.  I am so happy with this camera, I am going to start buying all of the accessories (lenses, filters).<br /><br />I suggest that you buy at a store that has a return policy in case you are not happy with your purchase.  Staples offers a 14 day return policy.  But I won't be returning mine!<br /><br />Try it...it's worth a cyber-shot!!!<br /><br />Update 3/13/05<br /><br />If you're trying to decide between the Sony DSC-P100 and the Sony DSC-W1, maybe this will help make your decision. I have had the recent experience to play with the DSC-W1. The pictures were okay, a little soft, but sharpness can be increased in manual mode.  I like the pictures from the DSC-P100 much better.  The movie mode wasn't quite as good as the DSC-P100 either.  The DSC-W1 produced blurry movie mode scenes without even moving the camera.  Thought this may help.","I am a sony freak. My laptop is VAIO, my palm is a Clie, my camcorder is a Sony MiniDV, my surround sound, cd, alarm, you get the picture. So when I decided to get my second digital camera (don't want to discuss the first, a Kodak easy share I bought about two years ago, the wounds are still fresh) I knew I would get a Sony, I just didn't know which one.<br /><br />After doing some research I decided on a 5.1 megapixel for quality, and I wanted small, but not so compact that I would lose it. The DSC-P100 is small, but not microscopic like some out there. It's also made of metal and easy to grip, I don't feel like I'm going to break it when I use it. I've had it for about a week now and the pictures are magnifficent and the resolution is unbelievable! It comes with a 32mg memory stick which is enough for just taking pictures casualy at events, but eventually I plan on purchasing more. The sound playback on the video is great, I can clearly hear what is being said on playback on my camera.<br /><br />Sony does well with using the Carl Zeiss lens, I also have it on my miniDV and knew I wanted it on my digital camera. I have yet to use the burst feature, I didn't even know it was on this camera until after I bought it.<br /><br />I didn't have much luck with my first digital camera (OH! the terrible pain!) so I consider this my first real experience with one. I love it, it's easy and fun to use. The LCD screen on the back is big enough that I can clearly see the picture without having to squint.<br /><br />Side note: I bought my printer when I bought my camera and I have to say I tried about 15 different printers for picture quality and the Sony color 4x6 printer was horrible. The best picture quality I found was an Epson Stylus Photo R320, the pictures look like I just got them back from the developer, not my printer. If you're going to buy a camera that can output perfection the way the Sony DSC-P100 can, get a printer that can represent it properly.","after months of searching around for a digital camera, i finally decided to choose this cute sony for a number of reasons. one, it was in my price range with rebates and discounts from sears. two, it was the upgrade of a model that was fairly successful and customers had been pleased. three, it has 5 whopping megapixels! with the added features like scenes, mpeg movie mode, and changing the resolutions, i knew this was the camera for me. the metal body is also an added bonus. if you are an amatuer and just want a digital camera, this is a good camera for you.","I thought a long time on which camera to get, it was either P-100 or Canon A95 and in the end i went with the P-100. Let me tell you it's a great camera, easy to use, great pictures, just overall a great camera. Who ever buys this camera won't be disappointed. I also like the flash it's very good!!!","Awesome manual features, and effective automatic features.  You'll have great pictures no matter what mode you choose.  And there are plenty to choose from.  What an improvement over my Sony cybershot of 2 years ago.  This thing is ultra-fast, and the battery life is substantialy long.  Great movie clips too.  not clunky, but slim, sleek and stylish, not to mention light weight and small enough to fit in your pocket comfortably.  Definately the best point-and-shoot camera available at this point in time.","I like the camera.  About 2 months of use.  Read reviews of focus problems - they are right about the problem.  I have found that setting my camera on the \"P\" setting and selecting \"Center AF\" helps.  Sony needs to address this problem.  The battery last a long time on one charge even when using flash.  You need to spend some time with this camera to get the most out of it.  I like it enough to purchase the 7.2 megapixels and will give this 5.1 as a gift.  I purchased this camera for a pocket camera and it is serving that function well.","Wow! This camera is great! I'm not too sure there's anything wrong with this one... There are some features that have been removed since my last Sony Cybershot 2 Megapixel, but those have been replaced with some great NEW features. I especially like the histogram display, it tells you (when you're going manual) if the picture is too dark or too bright. Pretty neat idea. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this camera at Amazon's price. I bought it the day after thanksgiving for a little cheaper, but the Amazon price is still good. I'd like to mention the dock too. I haven't bought it yet, but I plan to. ANOTHER THING: Rechargable LI-ION in the cybershot! FINALLY!, the charging port is in kind of a wierd place, but there are ways to work around that.<br /><br />THE ONLY CON (perhaps?):<br /><br />The USB is on the bottom of the camera, it doesn't use the traditional mini connector, it's a whole new fandangled connector. The box includes two of these, one for USB and one for connection to the TV (MONO SOUND TOO!) YOU CANNOT HOOK THE USB AND TV SIMULTANEOUSLY!!!! (It's not possible) UNLESS... you buy the docking station.<br /><br />Overall, through what i've done with it so far, it's a great little camera! BUY THIS ONE! It should last you an amazingly long time too. (5.1 Megapixel is AWESOME, 4x6 Prints Easily, no quality loss even when cropping) Thanks for reading, and do yourself a favor and buy this camera, you'll be happy you did!","I am not a camera nerd... yet, I would say this is the best camera I have ever owned.","i was looking for a flat camera with optical zoom. this is it! okay, it's not cheap, but comparable cameras from cheaper companies than sony had some critical reviews in terms of picture quality, especially moving images. this is my second sony, and i am still very happy with it. 1 inch flat is like a pack of zigarettes, you can carry in your pocket without problem. and the zoom helps a lot if you cannot or do not want to get too close to your object...<br /><br />i carry the camera all the time, it's really fun. and the movie-optionus useful too. so you pay a little more, but you will not regret it.","I put off buying a digital camera for a long time because I heard from friends (and saw) that the results with theirs were disappointing. But now that my child is in pre-school, the need to share pictures with others has increased dramatically, and the expense of printing bad takes has become just plain senseless.<br /><br />I purchased this camera about a week ago and have been playing with it nonstop ever since. To my amazement and delight, it has so far taken the most pristine pictures of any camera I've ever owned - PERIOD! I'm no photography expert or even so much as a hobbyist, but the comparison in picture quality between this and my previous camera, a Nikon point-and-shoot 120 ED, is night and day. The difference can be seen vividly when viewing pictures on a computer screen. I can now blow 2MB pictures up to poster size before any noticeable pixellation occurs; with my old camera, a picture scan of that quality would use up at least 60MB. (You read that correctly: two versus SIXTY megabytes!)<br /><br />As others have pointed out, you need to know going in that Sony includes a rock-bottom bare minimum of storage in the Memory Stick provided with the camera (only 32 MB), and you will almost definitely want to purchase a larger one (it doesn't pay to buy anything less than 256MB). And be prepared to spend some time with the camera's manual in order to understand some of the basic settings. But I shopped around and researched before I took this plunge, and right now I don't think there's any better family-friendly camera or deal on the market.<br /><br />In short, if you've waited for digital cameras to cross a certain threshold of quality, reliability and price, that day has come at last. GO FOR IT!","DSC-P100 is my second Sony camera, I bough on june 20 2004 and the battery is damage with just 3 months used.  Now I have to buy a new one.","I've been using my P100 for about a week now and I've been THRILLED with the results. I have used a Canon PowerShot S45 for the past year and a half and was very disappointed with the auto focus performance. The P100 is SO FAST when focusing and taking pictures....it's much easier to capture great photos of my 2 year old. The complaint about Memory Sticks being expensive is invalid, there are a lot of manufacturers available now and the prices have come down substantially. Awesome battery life and small size are additional pluses. All in all a great point and shoot camera with some flexibility for being creative.<br /><br />The honeymoon period with the Sony DSC-P100 was short lived.  While it has great macro performance and portability, the weak flash and over-aggressive anti-noise processing kill the good features of this camera.  Even in bright light there was a 50/50 chance that the picture would turn out well.  We took roughly 1000 pictures and finally decided to sell the P100 on ebay.  [...]Maybe mine was defective and others perform better.  I wish I could change the 5 star rating I've given the camera but I can't.","I am impressed with the overall performance and image quality of the P100. It really has a very fast start up time as well as a very short shutter lag (0.3-0.5s )also as mentioned at imaging-resource.com. It rivals some of the D-SLR's on these parameters! It has a Carl-Zeiss lens that provides excellent quality iamges. The colors and saturation of images are well balanced, I do not feel to play around with imaging software to make them  look better. In addition, it is light and thin, can be carried around w/out much hassle. It has a great macro. Finally, the battery goes and goes and goes without dying out... Overall I am very satisfied with P100 and would definitely recommend it as a full features high-quality P&S camera.","great camera.....you will be so happy.....but an exact camera comes out next month in 7MP from sony, the DSCP150, same size, same options, little different caseing, and all under 500 bucks.....amazing","Everyone has aleady said what needed to be said except that the camera (as fast as a rocket that it is) slowes down a lot on flash photography after battery is half empty (remember half empty is not empty yet). With a fresh charge flashes are ready in no time but after %50 of battery charge, it will take 3-5 seconds for the flash to recharge. I think that could be imporved. Other than that I think it is an AMAZING camera. Oh yes and my other personal wish: Add a stitch option to take pictures and connect them together easily (just like Canons)","I have held out on purchasing a digital camera because I have been unimpressed with the quality of pictures that my friends have gotten with their cameras. During a recent vacation, my niece received a camera for a birthday gift. I watched her take pictures, and I loved the idea of instant gratification by being able to see the picture immediately. For the rest of the trip, I looked at digital cameras, and finally at the end of the trip decided to purchase the Sony Cybershot DSP 100 camera. I took pictures the last week of vacation, and had them printed out. I was so pleased by the quality of the camera. The day after I returned, I took pictures of some flowers at a local Botanical garden, and I was so excited by how well the camera captured the beautiful colors. Everyone that has seen these pictures have remarked on the clarity and color.<br /><br />  The Carl Zeiss lens was the deciding factor over the other 5.0 cameras I looked at. My dad recommended this lens to me, and I must say, it makes all of the difference.<br /><br />  I have not had a chance to try out all of the special features, but I am already so happy with my choice. If you are deciding on a camera. I say go for this one.","After months of searching for the perfect ultra-compact camera I came down with Canon S500, S410 and Sony P100.  I then decided to go for the Sony P100 and that's one perfect decision I'll never regret.  This camera is awesome and you can't go wrong with it. As advertised, its lightning fast and its battery life is unbelievable.  I used this on a 5 day museum hopping in Chicago, and in those 5 days I took hundreds of pictures and several videos and only needed to charge my camera once! While my friend who has a Canon S410 had to charge his camera everyday. Picture quality is also excellent and is the same if not better than Canon's.  But with a better movie mode, LCD screen, battery life and speed, there's no way you'll choose Canon over this one.","After many internet research and asking friends, it came down to Canon S500 vs Sony Cybershot P100.  Final decision was Sony Cybershot P100 and I was very happy with that decision.  This little camera give very real image color and quality.  I had a Olympus Camedia 3040 which I was very please with but carrying it around can be a hassle.  with this little camera, it become a pleasure to have it around and best part is that you know you can still take nice pictures.","After doing about 2 months of research on a digital camera, I decided on and am very pleased with the Sony P100.  I had narrowed my choice between the Canon S410 and the Sony P100.  I could not justify paying more for the Canon when the Sony had triple the features. However, I purchased both these cameras so I could compare picture quality for myself.  Much to my delight, once I got it home and played with it, I found out the Sony took better pictures.  Yes, that's right BETTER pictures than the Canon S410.  Isn't that the bottom line?  Great pictures have always been #1 on my list.  And yes, all the other reviews are correct, it is incredibly fast.  I have two young children and I will not be missing many, if any, great memories.  I would have to say that the Canon does feel a little more solid in the hand but that is just personal preference.  It comes with numerous special features that I hope to learn.  But until then, it is nice just knowing they are there when that time comes.  Also, strangely enough, the Canon does not have a date stamp option.  Something that my husband and I really use.  Try it, I think you will be very happy.","I could not be more happy with this camera!  It was between the Nikon 5200 and Sony W1 and I am so glad I chose this one.  I tried out the Nikon for a few days and returned it; too light and awkward and terrible colors.<br />This camera is perfect!  Just the right size, small and pocketable but still with enough heft.  Although, for one-handed shooting I feel much more comfortable with the wrist strap on, since it is small and feels like it could almost slip out of my grasp, although it hasn't happenned yet.<br />I previously had a Sony DSC-S85 which is HUGE compared to this thing and was so slow, you could never catch any action.  But it took beautiful photos, and this one is even better.  I have not had one bad picture yet, and I've taken about 150 so far, in all kinds of lighting situations.  The only editing I've had to do is a couple of red eyes, not bad at all.  I haven't noticed any \"purple fringing yet\" and the pictures are clear and crisp and gorgeous.  Skin tones are right on (which is a problem in many digicams), and the histogram feature is really nice in questionable lighting.<br />This little puppy is blazing fast.  You push the on button and you are snapping away in literally a second.  Lag time is next to nothing.  It's a little more if you program it to show a quick preview after each picture, but you can turn that feature off. Speaking of features, there are tons!  The scene pre-sets are handy, and the menus are intuitive.  Although, I have had to adjust to the slightly different layout from my previous sony.  This one's is better though.<br />When reviewing pictures this camera is speedy.  You don't have to wait at all for the pictures to load clearly.  The multi burst feature is cool, you can get dramatic slow-motion effects.  But I don't think you can view them anywhere but on the camera, at least I haven't figured that out yet.<br />The battery lasts forever.  I shot about 80 pictures and video (standard) at my nephew's birthday party today, used a lot of flash and reviewed the pictures many times, also turned the camera on and off lots.  There's hardly a dent in the battery, in picture mode it's telling me over 150 minutes left.  My last camera had the infoLithium also and it was so great!  Sony has it figured out.<br />The video quality has improved dramatically but don't plan on using as a substitute for you camcorder -it's not that good yet- plus you'd have to spend $1000's on a couple 1GB memory stick pro's to hold those enormous files.  But in a pinch it works nice.  Speaking of the memory sticks, those things are expensive, so factor in at least one 256MB pro stick (512 would be ideal, but more $$$) which will run at least $60.00 if you go sandisk or lexar, etc.<br />Another great feature is that you can get conversion lenses.  However they look a little bulky and awkward but I think I may invest in the telephoto someday.  Hopefully by the next time I'm ready to purchase a new digital camera they will be putting higher optical zoom lenses in them at this price rance.<br />Overall, you get a great little camera for a lot less money than many with less features and less quality.  I have finally found a camera my husband will use (and can actually produce printable pictures on!).  I couldn't recommend this little camera more.  You will not be disappointed!","I agree with tmax.  I also bought the Nikon 5200 and was not happy with it.  The store that I returned it to had the Sony sitting there waiting for me to give it a try.  I really liked the Nikon 5200 for the overall \"cool\" factor, but when all was said and done, the Sony just plain old beat the pants off the Nikon as far as quality goes.  The video was about the same, but the picture quality was far far superior.  I need a camera that I can point and shoot - and still come up with good photos (without having to fiddle around with a bunch of settings).  The Nikon took awful pictures.  So, I'm keeping the Sony.","Here are some of my initial impressions after using the P100 for a week now. These are things that I had read about that I thought might be a concern before I bought the camera, and now that I've actually been able to use it here's what I have found so far:<br />1) Sharpness of photos: very good. There is an option to adjust the default setting to +1 sharpness or -1 sharpness depending on what you like. I chose to increase the sharpness and find this captures all the details, facial features, environment, crisp and clean.<br />2) Size: this is very compact which I like and is very portable. It also feels sturdy, so no complaints. I feel like this is something I can take with me very easily without any hassle.<br />3) Movie mode: this was a key factor in luring me to this model. After shooting some movies, I plugged in the supplied cable to my TV (AV cables) and voila! I was watching my footage on the 34\" screen and it looked great. I used the 640x480, 30 frames per second, fine mode (the highest quality setting on the camera) and was very impressed. User tip: the focus needs to be set at a fixed distance such as 0.5m for closeups, all the way to infinity if shooting landscapes. If left on multifocus or centerfocus the camera focus will constantly be adjusting to every movement in the frame causing a very disorienting effect. Caveat: this is not a camcorder and could never include all the functions of a dedicated camcorder. But, for someone like me who only wants to carry one device and keep things at a minimum this is a fantastic gadget. With the 1GB memory stick pro (which you will have to fork over some $$ for), you can shoot about 12 mins at the highest quality setting (so I bought two of them).<br />4) Startup time and lag time: startup time is virtually nil. Press the on button and it's running. Amazing. Lag time will depend on your settings, most importanly, how you set the flash settings. So this will vary from user to user. On the basic 'auto' mode, the lag time from pressing the shutter to the shot being taken in only a couple of seconds. When using the 'red eye reduction' flash mode, it's probably around 4-5 seconds lag.<br />5) Battery duration: aboout 2-2.5 hours depending on what you're doing, viewing, etc. Full battery charge takes about 3 hours.<br />The main things I was looking for in improvements over my last Sony 3megapixel digital camera were:<br />1) would it be faster: overall, yes<br />2) smaller size: yes (I don't think a smaller camera would be  user-friendly)<br />3) improved video: yes<br />I'm a nit-picker when it comes to electronic devices, but have found the P100 to meet or exceed my expectations. If there were one thing I would like to see improvement on (and this applies to all digital cameras) is achieving a zero-second lag time when it comes to pressing the shutter and having the picture being snapped. This might not be possible, but I would like to see instantaneous click-to-shot times.<br />----- update to my initial review ------<br />I went and bought the 'base station' for the camera. My main reason for getting this was for ease in hooking up the camera to my tv. You can hook the camera up to your tv without the base station, but because the cable connection in the camera is on the bottom of the camera, it means you have to lay the camera on its front or back which I didn't like doing. I can keep the station hooked up to the TV at all times, it doubles as a charger for the battery, and it has it's own remote so you can sit on the couch and scroll through the picturs and movies. You can also zoom in on pictures (and the pictures hold their sharpness--amazing zoom detail). Pricey but a handy accessory.<br />P100 cybsershot case: this is the black case 'made for the P100' which has the square metal \"logo\" on the top flap. This is a POOR case for the camera. While I like the materials, the closure is velcro and the camera fit is too snug, so it feels like the flap will pop open. My suggestion would be to look for a different case.","I just purchased this as a replacement from my Sony P-72 3.2 meg camera.  WOW!  This camera is so much more improved from only a couple years ago.  Aside from the 5.1 megapixel count, this camera excels in almost every conceivable area relevant to compacts.<br />First off, this camera starts up in less than a second or so--truly fast compared to other similarly priced cameras.  This feature is essential when attempting to capture that oh so special kodak...er...sony moment in a blink.<br />Secondly, the camera is beautiful.  Sony got it right this time when designing a sturdy, compact and lightweight technological masterpiece.  True, it's not as small as its even lighter cousin--the T-1, or the Pentax Optio S4i and Casio Ex-z4, but it passes the pants pocket test with flying colors. Additionally, when compared to the T-1, this camera uses the regular memory stick size and not the smaller duo like the T-1. Sooooo, if you already own a sony, this is a natural upgrade.<br />Some other excellent features on the P-100 are the manual overides.  You can adjust the shutter speed and aperature which, for a camera in this class, is a true rarity.<br />Unlike the T-1, this cam does have a tripod mount, a no brainer for any serious photographer.  I also am enjoying the extremely high quality video mode; although not the most important selling point, having the ability to take camcorder like videos with sound for unlimited amounts of time (unlike 30 second segments from many other cams) is handy.<br />Another amazing feature is the battery life.  I remember my first sony digital camera--the DSC-P50 2.1 mega pixel.  It's battery life was dismal.  My P-72 was slightly improved, but still suffered from chronic battery munchies.  The P-100 fully charged can take pictures for over 200 minutes!  If you're on the display modes, it can last almost double that--another breathtaking accomplishment.  The info lithium works well in calculating the remaining battery life--a major complaint from owners of other cameras like Canon that lack this feature.  Lastly, it is a proprietary battery, so purchasing an additional one is recommended.<br />Needless to say, the 1.8\" lcd is gorgeous, just like the past sony cameras I've had.  It's extremely hi-res and I have no difficulty seeing it in sunlight.  The lcd's navigation is similar to earlier sony cams with a few new additions like a light metering box.<br />Overall, I'm tremendously pleased with the picture quality from this puppy.  I envision this camera lasting well into early-mid 2005 when Sony will release yet another improvement.  Until then, I highly recommend this for most anybody who appreciates quality and functionality incorporated into a lightweight package.","This camera has to be one of the best cameras out there. When i first got it I noticed its sleek design. Its so small and light. It fights in the palm of my hands and I can carry it anywhere. I actuallly noticed too that its basically smaller than my nokia 6800 cell phone which is shocking. anyway the camera has a nice 1.8 inch LCD screen. The photos look amazing when you view them. When you are dealing with this camera you also get the FASTEST performance. The camera starts up in like 1 or 2 seconds and it shoots with NO LAG. Even if you are shooting with flash the shot to shot time is awesome. The zoom pops out very fast too which also makes a funny noise. i don[t reallyh ahve to explain the picture quality because you know Sony is always EXCELLENT with that. Others say that canon is better but I think Sony's a tad better well atleast with this camera anyway. The movie mode on this camera is comparable to a camcorder. It shoots VGA (640x 480) at an option of 15fps or 30fps. 30 fps is basically smoother but requires about twice the memory so 15fps would be sufficient for any user. To tlel you the truth i bought this camera for the movie mode too because its much better than the Canon S500. Lastly, the battery is outstanding. You can shoot pictures a little over 3 hours worth. I recommend geting the accessory kit from sony (comes with battery, case, wallet thing) about $65 on ebay and a 256mb memory stick card or 512 memory stick pro card. You can get the 512mb one for under $120!!<br />Oh and I forgot to mention the cool accessories available for this beastily camera. You can get 1.7X telephoto lens, 2.6X lens (turns ur compact camera to almost a 8X optical demon, lol), .7X wide lens, marine pack (underwater case) and external flash (some say the flash on the camera isn't bright enough so people buy external separate ones)","Ultra-compact digicam comparison: which ultra-compact camera should I buy? Make sure you read the whole thing - it'll give you an idea of what to look for yourself.<br />Considered: Fuji F610, Sony T1, Sony T11, Sony P100, Pentax Optio S4i, Canon S500, Nikon 3700/5200.<br />Fuji 610 (72 x 93 x 31 mm)<br />Pros: excellent camera with awesome image quality. Claim that vertical design will limit camera shake - maybe. Video quality excellent at 640 x 480 (30fps). xD picture cards cheap.<br />Cons: Larger than canon s500 and sonyp100 - but not a huge problem considering the better features (especially the amount of manual controls with shutter/aperture). BUT - NO AF ASSIST LAMP: therefore poor low light performance. Not able to switch off digital zoom such that the optical switches over to digital automatically - which will reduce image quality stored. But the clincher here is the lack of AF assist lamp.<br />Sony P100 (108 x 51.5 x 26.6 mm)<br />Pros: It's a Sony: their attention to detail is always guaranteed. Nine scene selections which makes shooting for amateurs so much simpler and takes you up that extra notch - read excerpt below. Option of attaching a wide-angle telephoto lens down the track - should you start to take your photography (more) seriously. Excellent video quality at 640 x 480 (30fps or 17pfs), size unlimitied). AF assist lamp. Battery life indicator: provides estimated mins remaining. Battery has also been found to be of exceptional stamina - compared to other digicams of this size.<br />I got this from Imaging-Resource: \"Scene mode offers a range of preset exposure modes, including Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Landscape, Soft snap, Snow, Beach, High Speed Shutter, Fireworks, and Candle modes. Both Twilight modes optimize the camera for low-light shooting by allowing shutter times as long as two seconds, while Landscape mode sets the camera up for shooting distant subjects. Soft snap mode warms skin tones and sets focus to slightly soft. Snow mode enhances saturation and adjusts exposure, to prevent loss of colour in bright white snow scapes, while Beach mode ensures that blue tones are recorded accurately in lakeside or seaside photos. High-speed shutter mode is for shooting action or bright subjects. Fireworks mode preserves colour in shots of fireworks or other night light displays by fixing the lens aperture at f/5.6 and setting the exposure time to the 2-second maximum. Candle mode slows shutter speeds and biases exposure to keep candlelit scenes looking natural; a tripod is recommended in this model\"<br />Cons: Memory stick: expensive, but prices have come down and will come down further. Definitely get yourself a MS Pro Duo (either a 256, or better still 512MB). Getting the Duo now (which is not much more $) will keep you ahead of the game. Size: slightly longer than Canon S500 but thinner - so not so bad. Overall the cons are not awfully bad.<br />Sony T1/T11 (T!: 91mm x 60mm x 21mm)<br />Pros: Awesome design. Very thin. All other pros similar to Sony P100. Nice option of black.<br />Cons: NO tripod mount - sure it's an ultra-compact which you'd carry around, but sometimes it's nice to mount it for macro and other shots. I would have seriously forked out the extra cash for this camera but the lack of a tripod mount was the clincher.<br />Canon S500 (87.0 x 57.0 x 27.8 mm)<br />Pros: Size: I like to use this camera as a benchmark for size comparisons with other cameras. Design and form factor: almost as good as Sony: very elegant. CF - cheap, very cheap. I've previously had the Canon S230 (3.2MP 2X optical) and it was an excellent camera.<br />Cons: VERY, VERY POOR: no battery life indicator - with the S230 I have been caught out many times, this is especially so when other members of your family use the camera and you have no idea how much charge is left. The solution is to get a spare battery, but Canon should have rectified this issue by now and they have deliberately chosen not to and that tells me something. Video at 320 x 240 (15fps): if you want 640x480 only available at 10pfs: compare this with Sony and Fuji, both at 640x480, 30fps!! Now I know that this is a digital camera and not a camcorder - but it's nice to know that you can take VGA quality shots at an instant - so you're always prepared - because who carries the camcorder everywhere?!!<br />Pentax Optio S4i ((83 x 52 x 20mm))<br />Pro: Size. Size. And price.<br />Cons: No AF assist lamp: therefore poor in low light. Although a good camera, you'll read that it's more a `fun' camera than half-serious like the Sony P100 or Canon S500. Of course the Fuji F610 takes it up a notch as far as manual features go. Also the video quality is poor: similar to the canon S500 - although I would imagine Canon would still do a better job of it.<br />Nikon 3700 (95.5 x 50 x 31 mm)<br />Pro: Scene selection. Size.<br />Cons: Some have claimed a disparity between sound and video - not sure about this though. Appearance: very uninspiring, like the rest of the coolpix family.<br />CONCLUSIONS<br />Rank overall:<br />1. Sony P100 (image quality, scene options, video quality, it's a Sony)<br />2. Canon S500 (two downfalls - and both quite big - no battery life indicator and low video resolution)<br />3. Fuji F610 (NO AF assist, can't switch off digital zoom)<br />If size and form factor the most important and tripod mount absolutely not necessary (e.g. if will be in handbag all the time): Sony T1","My excellent f717 was stolen so I purchased the P120, the black version of the P100 that includes an extra battery and belt wearable carry case. First thing you notice is the excellent 'only Sony can do this' build quality. Sony are not so good at large items, but excell in the small stuff. The second thing you notice is the speed of all features. Soon as you press the power button, the lens zips out right away and you're ready to shoot quicker than you can get your finger on the shutter release! Shutter lag is virtually non-existent. Sony's new improved independent menu navigation buttons are better than the previous all-in-one joypad. The picture quality DETAIL is not as good as the f717, but then, the lens is far smaller, but the speed and responsiveness is twice if not thrice as good. Movie mode is almost DVD quality with a Memory Stick Pro (640 x 480 at 30fps). What really made me buy this camera (and not buy another 717), other than the lovely compact design, is it's manual controls. While limited, you can adjust both the shutter and aperture, although only two f stops. I have only had the camera a few days, but can tell from what I have tried that Sony have fixed most of the flaws in their other compact digicams to deliver an outstanding piece of engineering that I shall be wearing on my belt everywhere now to snap that 'Koda', no, 'Sony' moment! :-)","Read my review on the Nikon 5200 - I compared the 2 and the SOny has much better color.. The Nikon was miserable..<br />I like the P100 so far very much","This is an absolutely great camera. I use it for Videos as well as pictures. The sound quality for the movies is good. It is easy to transfer the movies and pictures to your computer, especially if you have a Sony PC or laptop. Even otherwise, the USB cable provided is sufficient.<br />One thing though - and this would be true for any 5 mega pixel camera - the 32mb stick provided is really not sufficient. You should really plan on buying a 512mb stick with your camera, else you will constantly be running out of space."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W1","amazon_reviews":["Likes: The camera has an infinity (sideways 8)feature for focus.

I have had this camera for about seven years and the LCD viewfinder went out on it.  It wouldn't take pictures but everything else seemed to work.

I found that photos without the flash turned out best (I think this is true of most cameras, even the digital SLRs have flash issues).

I did have a problem at first with batteries draining super fast but then i bought rechargeables and it worked better. This camera has been through alot and it still works. just recently, though, the LCD display went out so I now have to look through the view finder. I have gotten some great pics and some bad ones out of it. The zoom is just horrible. Always fuzzy. But i have to say that it was a good camera for a beginner and I am looking for a better quality canon now.","My mother won this camera from her internet server on their grand opening.  Since she didn't use it, she gave it to me.  I love it.  I have never had a problem with my batteries draining to fast, but I do always carry spares.  (Mainly thats because I've had my batteries die in my other cameras when I needed them.)  My biggest love of this camera is the Canon name and their service department.  Two weeks ago I had a bottle of water leak in my backpack, and of course my camera was drenched.  It quit working immediately and I went into a panic.  When I got home from work, I went to the Canon website and emailed their service department and explained what happened.  Within 30 minutes they had returned an email to me with options on either fixing it for a base price of $79 with options if more service was needed.  Or upgrade to a refurbished Canon A400 for $75.  I decided to take the flash card out along with the batteries and let it air dry overnight.  The next morning I popped everything back in and (yippee!) everything works like a charm.  I think this camera is great.","I have the previous model A300 for about 2 years and have since taken more than 1000 pictures with it. It has given me satisfactory results most of the time and very good image quality considering its price. You can try out the various settings to get the desired results. I give it four stars because in dim light the camera doesn't always focus well. And the flash recharge cycle is a bit long.<br /><br />I used it heavily during my travels and it caused me no trouble.","I was looking for a good camera for a good price, and found the a310. Since I don't need great photos, even though this camera gives great photos, it's great. All the controls are very user friendly; you can switch from camera mode to movie taking mode with a mere switch, which brings me to the movie taking ability. Of course, you can't expect a great movie capability, but this camera sure covers what I need. With a decent sized card, you can get a whole lot of movies. However, on the highest resolution, you can only take movies up to 30 seconds long, which is okay for me since most movies longer than that get boring. I use a 512mb card, and can get about 450 seconds of high resolution video(30 seconds each)and more than 1000 seconds on medium. on low resolution....wow. I find myself using the movie capability more than the pictures. If you're starting out in photography, or just want a decent camera for a great price, you've found it.","This is an excellent camera and with an excellent price.  I had no problems with this camera out of the box.  It was simple to use and the picture quality is outstanding.  The movie mode is great for taking short movies.  The only complaint is taking multiple shots with the flash, it does take a little bit for it to recharge.  Other than that, I love it!","I bought this camera on a friend's advice. I have been very happy with it. It is packed with loads of features. I find it easier to use than my old point and shoot analog camera. The only drawbacks are, battery life, and the small CF card it comes with. I bought a 512mb card which allows me 300+ pics on the highest setting. I also bought re-chargable NiMH batteries which give me about 200 pics before they need to be replaced.","Was very excited to finally receive this camera through mail. Tried it out but was amazed of how quickly the included batteries died. Nothing major that rechargeable NIMH batteries couldn't fix. Loved the quality of the pics, but even loved it more when i figured out how to set it on the Superfine setting. The sliding lense cover both acts as a protective cover and the power switch which makes it very easy to use. The included USB cable and power adapter makes transfers to the computer an easy process. My favorite feature on this camera though, is the video mode with sound! The lag between each shot with the flash on is pretty aggravating though. Overall, This camera performs very well for the price and I take it everywhere I go!","This camera is pretty neat , light weight, excellent quality and nice videos. I bought this camera from Amazon about 2 weeks before and it came  with 64 MB Flash Card other than 16 MB internal memory. The only flaw I think it has is the quality of snaps taken in little dark places are not good enough according to the canon standards. Otherwise, its really nice to have such camera at such a low price.","Its a Canon, what else is there to say. It takes great clear pictures and the flash works great. This canon is also small in size, not big and bulky like other brands. Look at the cost, incredible, you pay under $140.00, no tax and free shipping. This camera cost a lot less than most of its competitors cameras that do about the same thing and like I said, you get a Canon, one of the worlds best camera makers, you cannot go wrong with this camera and you wont be disappointed, buy it today!","I bought this for my daughter because it is inexpensive and easy to use, and it's been a lot of fun. You will be hard pressed to find a better 3.2 megapixel camera for the money. Picture quality is excellent, operates on two AA batteries (get rechargables with a recharger because battery life is short), downloads your photos in seconds to your computer through a USB cord that comes with the camera, has a zoom (the 5x max zoom is not sharp; you are better off cropping and enlarging a non-zoom photo image on the computer), the flash is decent, and the features are functional. My daughter loves it. I have been a confirmed film camera purist and still prefer my Nikon with its hefty 28-210 zoom to a pixel image, but why lug that around when we have this little pocket wonder? A perfect introduction to digital photography...","This camera is very nice. Okay, having no optical zoom is definetely a setback, but all of its other nice features make up for it, still giving it 5 stars. It uses only 2 batteries, and doesn't weigh a ton. Also, the sliding lens cover makes it a bit more durable than other cameras without one. But my favorite feature is the movie mode. How can anybody argue with a camera this small, this cheap, with movie mode?","As an owner of two other canon cameras (G2 & S50) I'm obviously pleased with the products they put out. When I decided to look for a smaller lightweight anytime camera I again went with canon. I did look at nikon, fuji, and sony, who all had nice features but for the money and options this camera looked best. After playing with it for a bit I'd have to say the point and shoot pictures are very good--outside. the load up time is short, and I can simply snap away without a problem. The pictures come out very bright and clear for a 3.2mp camera--some nice stuff. Now when taking pictures inside, the story is a lot different..the flash drains serious battery power (a310 takes AA or nimh rechargables) and takes close to 30 seconds to 'recharge' before you can take another picture. Luckily I don't plan on using this inside much, but if you are this is definitely something to be worried about. The lens is fixed, but there is a 5x digital zoom that works pretty well between 3-4x once you get to 5x its very grainy. Size is good, it's about the same size as my s50 but much lighter, the power-on mechanism is the same, using the front lens cover as the switch. it's rather secure compared to the s50, i don't feel that it will open up accidently often. To wrap this up, my overall feeling is that I'm pleased with the purchase, the battery life is short, my first set of AA batteries died in about 45 minutes, the features are good, the pictures come out nice and the video option works fine. indoor pictures aren't so hot, but if you change the ISO speed and exposure you can pull off decent pictures with or without the flash. It's a great camera!"]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot A75","amazon_reviews":["works good","camera was defective. but received full refund","A replacement that works very well.  Well worth my effort.","I wish I had know that the screen didn't work. It works but I wish I could see the pics I take. Kinda disappointed.","good unit","Great!","works good","camera was defective. but received full refund","A replacement that works very well.  Well worth my effort.","I wish I had know that the screen didn't work. It works but I wish I could see the pics I take. Kinda disappointed.","good unit","Great!","I had to send it in for repair once, but it was covered for free.  I like the fact that I can use interchangeable lenses on it, which is the only reason why I bought this model.","So let's get one thing straight right away. Canon's had a defective image sensor in several of the products they sold from roughly 2003-2005, the A75 included. Btw the sensor itself was made by Sony. But the good news was that Canon gave away Free repairs until Jan of 2012 for the A75 when they ran out of parts.  So just be aware if you buy an A75 and have the purple ccd problem you'll need to buy the sensor off ebay and then do the repair yourself or pay someone to do it for you IF you end up ever having that problem.<br /><br />Regarding the A75 itself, it is still to this day a great camera. The only thing separating it from a 2012 camera is it doesn't have an absurd number of megapixels you'll never use and has a small screen. Plus it's obviously chunkier than a 2012 model. In it's time period it was one of the very best pocket camera you could buy. Plus it has Full manual controls and to top it off was affordable. Full manual controls on affordable pocket cameras simply do not exist today, period.<br /><br />If you are wondering about using a 3MP camera in 2012, the bottom line is people don't even print photos anymore for the most part. They put them on Facebook etc. Even if you do want to print, I've made great 8x10 prints with this 3MP camera. Now they will tell you that you need XX number of Megapixels to print 8x10 etc but I promise you that this camera makes perfect 4x6 and 5x7 prints and great 8x10 prints. Just keep in mind the potential ccd issue which may or may not affect you. The only reason this camera gets 4 out of 5 is the potential ccd issue. Even then when I had the problem it was after 5 years of use so I literally have nothing to complain about.","I was given the underwater housing for this camera, and I purchased it used for $50.  For a 3.2 MP it takes astoundingly sharp photos, and given the right conditions, will challenge a dslr camera.","I brought this camera and I liked it, it came to my house in record time and wanted to take a picture","I love this camera! My pictures are always perfect and sharp. If something ever happened to it, I'd definitely get another Canon camera. I sent it in one time for a repair that was covered by Canon. They sent me the mailing label and returned it at no charge. They went the extra mile by cleaning the inside and lens. Canon offers superior service!","This was my first digital. It did great however after three years the sensor went dead. According to my dealer this was common with that camera. He sent it to Canon even though it was out of warranty. I only paid for the postage, the repair was free. Do not buy one of these unless the sensor has been replaced as it is common for them to go out. My wife's A75 also had the sensor go out. We threw it away and got a new camera.","Good, easy to use camera.  Camera does all the work, just point and shoot.","This is the little camera that can.  Ours is old, we didn't buy it used on this page, but I wanted to post.  We've had it for years - not sure how many, and it's going strong.  The picture started to get funny, and Canon immediately replaced the CCD unit (a known issue apparently) as well as a couple other parts, completely for free including shipping both ways.  We got it back exactly 13 days after mailing it, and this was over Christmas and New Year's!!!  The pictures are completely perfect again, the resolution is great, it takes movies (like all cameras you can't zoom while taking them) - for a relatively cheap camera, we're thrilled.  It's all we need.  The CF cards probably are the biggest downfall as everything seems to be SD anymore.  But I feel confident in saying trust Canon when you choose a camera - they really come through and make a good product.","This originally purchased for my intro to photography class in 2005. I still use it today! Truthfully, I only ever use manual mode. Occasionally I make mini-movies with it (the movie function only records for 1.5minutes at a time). Its been somewhat abused (dropped a couple of times)- so I'm impressed that it still works great. This is excellent for beginners who aspire to develop their photography skills but aren't ready to commit to the higher end SLRs like the Rebel.<br /><br />Many people don't like the autofocus boxes. Over the years I've learned to manipulate them so they aren't quite the hinderence they could be. You just gotta learn how to trick the camera to focus on what you want- I use my hand, its the best tool to get the autofocus boxes to move to where you want it to go. Obviously that adds more time to the setting up process of a shot.<br /><br />For fast spur-of-the-moment pics, you'll either want to turn that feature off or switch over to auto. The hard part with auto of course, you can't control the fstop and iso settings as well as you can in manual. So give and take.<br /><br />Not a pro camera by any means- but for the enthusiast, it is a good little workhorse. I love it!  --- I would definitely recommend rechargeable batteries and 1GB+ memory cards.","This camera is a winner. I got this last year for Christmas and man was it the perfect gift. Super easy to use and it takes the best pictures. I love that it is little and fits in my purse but still takes great pictures like the big cameras. You won't go wrong with this one.","It was a pretty good camera until Canon came up with this tiny bit of cameras which does not require 4 AA batteries. Man, that is so unfair!<br />Anyway, I still used it, it drinks the batteries very quickly.<br />I would definitely pay a little bit more and buy a s300 or sth better.<br />Now, after 2 years, suddenly, no falling, no nothing, its display is not working and it will not take any pictures.<br /><br />So I am left with it. I am planning to buy a sony this time, hope I will be lucky.","I bought this camera a few years ago and it worked wonderfully up until this summer.  It started saying \"memory card error\" on the screen and wouldn't take pictures.  If I executed a complicated series of commands, I might get the camera to turn on and take pictures for a brief amount of time.  There was no guarantee that the memory card error would not come back and delete the pictures or make them inaccessible, so I never left pictures on the camera for more than a few minutes.  This made using the camera outside of the house pretty much impossible.<br /><br />Eventually even the complicated button mashing was no longer enough.  It was all memory card error, all the time.  Then the camera stopped turning on and/or off.  It would freeze with its lens extended and not turn on no matter what, or it would refuse to turn off unless I removed the batteries.  If I did get the camera on, when I pushed the menu button it was anywhere from 5-10 seconds for the menu to come up if it did at all.<br /><br />I borrowed my mom's camera for a few months and hadn't bothered with this one, but I recently started messing around with it again.  Once I figured out that simultaneously holding down the power and set buttons would let me turn the camera on, I contacted Canon support.  I told them that I was getting a memory card error and that the camera was very difficult to turn on.<br /><br />The response that I got was to reset it to the factory settings, and if that didn't work then I would have to send the camera in to them to repair.  There was no mention of trying to format the memory card, cleaning the memory card and the slot, try a different card, nothing.  Just send it in.  I pay for shipping and insurance, and there's a minimum repair charge of $79, not including parts.  Oh, and if I don't want to do that, they'll sell me a refurbished camera for $110.  Why would I ever want to buy another Canon with customer service like that?  No attempt was made to be helpful, they just wanted more money.<br /><br />The only reason I gave the A75 three stars instead of one was because it took pretty decent pictures for the time that it worked, especially outside.  So if you want to buy a camera that will only work for a year, year and a half tops, go ahead.  I know I'll be replacing this one with a different brand and I doubt I'll ever buy Canon again.<br /><br />The A75 is not the only Canon that has the memory card error problem; it seems like all the different models do.  Buy at your own risk and don't expect any help from customer service.","First of all--it's a great little guy. I have owned it for 3 years, and it has not failed me. It takes AMAZING pictures in lowlight settings. As someone who much prefers natural light to using a flash, that is an important feature for me. I also have found that the 3.2 megapixel ability of the camera is fine. I don't plan on printing over 20x30 sized prints, which I am able to do with this camera (according to photo printing websites).<br /><br />The macro lens is a nice feature, and it works well, although sometimes I have a difficult time seeing on the LCD screen if it's in focus. LCD screens never seem to be sharp enough.<br /><br />The video function is pretty good. The sound is recorded great. It is a little bouncy, though, if you don't hold your hands perfectly still, but I can record 3 minutes worth of video on this. Not too shabby. However, the light meter doesn't adjust as you record video. So, if you move from a dark area to a lighter area, it just overexposes, and vice versa if you start out somewhere bright and go into a dark room.<br /><br />All in all, it is a great camera. What you should be aware of in 2007: CF memory cards are getting harder to find. I luckily found a 1GB card for this in November 2006, but that was the only one they carried on a whole display of other kinds of cards. If I were you, I would check around and make sure you can find extra CF cards. The 32MB card that comes with it doesn't hold much at all. A positive: it uses AA batteries. If you travel to a foreign country, you can always find those. If you have a lithium battery in a camera that requires its own charger, you would have to bring a power adapter with you, etc, just to charge your battery. Get rechargeable AA's and you're set to go.","I bought this when 3.1MP was just giving it up to 4MP and 5MP cameras. I needed an affordable solution with decent features and good quality digital photos and the Canon A75 3.2MP did the job for over 2 years, until someone stole the camera from my bag!<br /><br />This camera traveled with me through Europe for 2 months, China for 1 month and was always carried on me, in my sack or in my car almost all the time without a case every single day for 2 years.  It was thrown around in my sack or backpack and it did not fall apart or break, though it did show some cosmetic wear. I was impressed that it never mechanically broke and the camera worked flawlessly even after all the miles I put on it.<br /><br />I must have taken well over a 1000 pictures with the camera and the flash never dimmed but I did go through batteries much quicker at high quality settings. But at mid level (1024x768) and low res settings, the camera was very battery efficient.<br /><br />I was impressed by the quality of the pictures, very clean and very nice high quality images for the most part. I was also impressed with the high ISO sensitivity for indoor pics.  I took a bunch of indoor sports picks without a flash at high shutter speed with ISO mode and they turned out very well for a point and shoot camera. I was impressed for a cheap camera. At the time, the A75 3.1MP camera was great and I will miss it.  I'm sure the person who stole this camera from me is getting great use from it too.","I got this camera for my 7-year-old girl.<br /><br />I compare this camera with my cameras and it does crappy pics.<br /><br />However, for her what else I want?<br /><br />She is very happy with this camera and it is easy to use for her<br /><br />so I do recommend this for a kid.","Purchased the Powershot A75 after extensive research approximately 2 1/2 years ago.  Excellent everyday use camera (great photos and great ergonomics) for those who do not want an SLR.  I was completely satisfied with the product until the display went bad on December 25, 2006.  Display went dark with flashing horizontal lines and no photos could be taken.  Since the camera was out of warranty, I decided to look for a new camera as repairing it would not be cost effective.  While checking the new Canon camera line on their website, I found a Powershot A75 service advisory related to my problem.  In addition, the advisory stated that Canon would pay for the shipping and repair the camera for free, regardless of the warranty status.  I called Canon and spoke with a representative on December 26, 2006 and was told to mail the camera in for repair.  Canon emailed me a prepaid UPS label and a service request the very next day.  I shipped the camera to Canon on December 28.  On January 3, 2007, I received an email from Canon stating the camera was received for repair.  Also included was a link to their service center where I could track the repair progress.  Estimated time to repair and return the camera was 10 working days.  On Jannuary 11, I received an email staing camera was shipped on the 10th and would be delivered on the 12th.  Fedex delivered the camera mid-morning on the 12th.  The enclosed invoice (NO CHARGE) indicated Canon had replaced the CCD unit, updated the firmware and cleaned the camera.  Checked out the camera and everything is working perfectly.  This is OUTSTANDING customer support! Will I buy aother Canon product?  ABSOLUTELY.","Almost 2.5 years since I had this little babe, A75, I have accidentally swung it to the floor at least 5 times. And each time it survived. It takes excellent pictures. Four batteries might add some weight to the camera, but hey, when your batteries die in the middle of road, you will appreciate the fact that you can go into a convenient store and walk out with a camera fully charged. I love every single bit of this camera. My parents are very satisfied with this camera and the quality of the pictures taken. They don't need the camera to be too light or small in size. So they are going to take over this 2.5 year old camera. I am going to move on to another canon PowerShot. It had been a wonderful experience with A75.","The camera was delivered on schedule.  I examined the used camera and I found no scratcnes, wear marks or other regularities; all of the manuals and cables were provided. I could not believe that it was a used camera. I read the instructions and was impressed with the number of operating moads available; about 6 point and shoot moads plus series of manual moads. I shot a few pictures and was pleased with them. I would buy a used camera from this vendor without hesitation in the future.","great product. So easy to use. Compact. I would reccomend buying rechargeable batteries for it. Play around with all the different shooting modes, they are cool.","I have had my A75 for two years, and it just won't turn on now.  I recharged my batteries, then tried brand new batteries, but it just won't turn on.  Since the warranty was one year, I guess I am out of luck.  Probably more to repair it, than to get a new camera.","If you can get a new one, this so easy to use. I bought it for a boyfriend about 4 yrs ago and I still use it everyday to take pictures for work. I don't use the movie feature but the macro also is fine. For the money if you need to take everyday pictures of family and friends you won't go wrong. Only problem is that you need to make sure you press firmly on the botton. If you have anyone take pictures of yourselves, ask them to take a few just in case. It is great to use with all your left over compact flash cards. I carry a small battery charger on trips so I never run out of juice. I only wish I could carry this in my pocket. You can't have everything. The price is right.","I bought this camera two years ago and love it.  I now have two others that are newer and more expensive, but I still end up using this camera so often because it's practical, the batteries last forever and it takes the right size pictures for uploading fast to online printing services.  The pictures are great when printed as long as they are not enlarged much past 8x10 and the camera is extraordinarily sturdy.  I have kept it in my purse for extended amounts of time, taken it on many trips, it has been dropped several times, and it just keeps working  It is so easy to use in every way.  All of the menu items are entirely self explanatory.  I would highly recommend this camera.  My others are Canon also and I love them all.","When I bought my A75, I did a little research, and the reviews I read were great. 2 years later, I am happy with my choice. I got an excellent camera that has taken a lot of pictures on different places: beaches, mountains, cities... The quality of the pictures is awesome. Even if it is not a 7MP, I think that for an \"amateur home user\", this camera is more than enough","I haven't read the other reviews, but wanted to put my thoughts in.  I've had this camera for two years and it has performed wonderfully.  At one point my brother dropped it from about six feet onto concrete and it hasn't affected performance at all.  The 3.2 megapixel is more than enough to print great quality pictures ... I've printed mostly 4x6 and 5x7.  I think this is a great point and shoot digital camera, and it's a nice bonus to have the movie mode.<br /><br />There are a few limitations ...<br /><br />It guzzles battery power, particularly if you use the display all the time, which leads me to another point ... if you try to save battery power and sight photos through the viewfinder, the picture will be quite different than you think.  The only way to truly compose a photo to be exactly what you want is to use the display screen, which again causes short battery life.  Since it uses AA, I would recommend buying some rechargeable batteries, which is what I did.<br /><br />Another drawback is that it doesn't take good action shots.  There's a delay of about one second when you push the shutter button, particularly if the subject is moving and the AF won't lock.  You can hold the shutter button halfway to lock focus, but sometimes the subject has moved out of focus.  So, if you want to shoot a lot of action stuff, this might not be the camera for you.<br /><br />Another thing that I'm conscious of when I shoot with this camera is it's photo dimensions.  This camera offers image quality/proportions of 2048x1536, 1600x1200 and 640x480 ... all of which are basically 4x3.  So, if you want to any common print sizes - 4x6, 5x7, etc. - you have to go in and crop some off each photo.  If you can't do this manually, you photo processor will likely do it themselves without much care, taking equally from the top and bottom of shots, which might cut something you really want in the picture (like people's heads).  So, I have to be very careful now when I take pictures that I include enough space to make that crop.<br /><br />Overall though, I think this camera is worth the money.  It does a lot and has a lot of great features, but if you buy it you should be aware of its limitations.","I've had this camera for about a year and a half and I can't really complain! It takes fairly decent photos ~ outdoor photos are generally better. I don't normally use flash indoors (I like natural photos) and it does OK with this (better with a small tripod), but could be better when it comes to low-light settings as the images get grainy. I love that the batteries last on this thing so long. I bought two sets of rechargeable batteries and they seem to last forever. I can get a good 500 images at a time, which is good for travel.<br /><br />The best part about this camera is the durability. I dropped this thing on my hardwood floors once (gasp!!) and the side of the camera actually popped out. Guess what? The camera still works beautifully and I keep taking photos even though the piece is kind of popped out.","I got this camera over a year ago. I am very satisfied with the quality of the images. It does have a few limitations.<br /><br />1. Cannot shoot action shots because of the 1 second delay when auto focus is \"on\".<br /><br />2. Cannot shoot bright objects - they will over saturate.<br /><br />3. Occasional glitch when camera will not switch to capture mode.<br /><br />4. The viewfinder does not show the full view of the digital capture-only LCD show the true field of capture.<br /><br />5. Auto focus does not work well in low-light situations.<br /><br />6. Flash is too strong for close-up shoot.<br /><br />7. 3X optical zoom not quite enough and 10X digital zoom lead to  noisy images(almost useless feature).<br /><br />Other than these, the camera is easy to use and handle.<br /><br />Recommend you get 256KB flash memory and 4 rechargeable batteries. You can take up to 250 shots. Great for vacations.","I wanted something relatively easy to use that took high-quality pictures. I got just that and so much more. There are so many options and easy-to-use preset settings. I love that I can take short videos with sound. And even black and white (sepia-colored?) vintage-looking photos. I also really like that although it's easy to take good pictures without a lot of fooling around with settings, I also have the option of playing around with all the different settings and speeds to take more artistic images.<br /><br />The quality of the images is remarkable. My boyfriend and I both tried to photograph a vineyard scene at sunset-directly towards the sun. I with my Canon and he with his Kodak. I didn't even think it would come out but mine came out beautifully and his-not at all. I love, love, love this camera. I take photos of my artwork and need  to capture color accurately and fine details and this camera does a wonderful job. By the way, I've had it for a year now without any problems at all. I never usually write reviews, but in this case, I felt compelled because I think this is such a great product.","Canon powershot A75 is an excellent choice for an affordable digital camera with outstanding quality. The size of the camera allows easy handling and its controls to be easily accessed. Still images and video clips taken using its default automatic control setting are almost of professional quality even for novice users or children. The rechargeable 4 AA batteries and CF memory card allow one to enjoy it for very long time at a minimal cost.","When we first bought this Canon Powershot A75 digital camera I was very impressed. This was my first \"real\" digital camera (because I had used a simple free one before with very low quality pictures at 640*480 resolution) and I really liked how it was easy to use and had a clear and colorful 1.8\" LCD screen on the back.<br /><br />We originally had the 32 megabyte memory card with the camera, which can hold enough pictures (the storage depends on the resolution of the pictures, however 32 megabytes is good for about 100 pictures at decent resolution). My brothers and I mainly used the camera to take pictures of awesome sports cars and rare foreign cars such as old vintage Porsches, Dodge Vipers, and Lamborghinis (we participated in what we dubbed drive-by-shootings, where we would drive by and take pictures of rare and awesome cars, and now our collection has over 1000 pictures). The pictures were generally very good quality, but the problem is that this camera is very susceptible to movements while taking a picture.  Therefore, many of the pictures come out blurry. However, there are many modes for the camera, such as outdoor mode, action mode, indoor mode, night mode. These modes help when you're taking action shots, but unless you have a tripod there are too many pictures that will come out blurry.<br /><br />The zoom capabilities of this camera were a pretty cool feature, although 3X zoom is fairly common on digital cameras. The menus and options are generally easy to use, and you can get by without learning about all the advanced features if you just want basic pictures. However, I suggest that you get the 512 megabyte memory card, because then you can store an almost unlimited number of pictures. With this card, at high resolution you can store over 700 pictures, and if you opt for the email-friendly low resolutions pictures at 640*480 (which come out looking pretty good) you can store thousands of pictures. This is great for overseas trips or for convenience because you don't have to keep uploading to your PC. Also a 512 MB or 1 GB memory card is great for taking videos.<br /><br />This camera also takes short videos, which are actually impressive quality for a digital camera of this price. The sound quality is pretty decent also, and the videos are either 320*240 or 640*480. With our 512 MB card we could take a video of about 20 minutes at the lower resolution.<br /><br />By now you're probably wondering why I gave this camera 3 stars. Well, after having this camera for about a year it had a major failure. I was using it to zoom in and out at one of my brother's school award ceremony and then the LCD image just became very blurry. From then on, the LCD monitor was constantly blurry and all the pictures became blurry. So after that we couldn't take any more pictures. Now the camera is ruined, and with our warranty expired we'll have to probably get it repaired at a high cost. Hopefully, the new Canon Powershot A90 doesn't have this serious malfunction. There are many other excellent Canon cameras to purchase, but I don't suggest this one unless you get at least a 2-year warranty and perhaps use the zoom sparingly.","I have owned many brands of Digiams from HP to Sony to Kodak and have found this to be the best of them all(with Sony as a close runner-up). The pictures you get from this are simply stunning. Perfectly saturated colors with VERY little noise(Even on high ISO's). Battery life is very good with nimh's, mainly due to utilizing 4 batteries. The interface is FULL of features, yet not overwhelming. Canon really did their homework on the A-series cameras!","Pros:<br /><br /> - Features: does everything automatically for you with pretty good results and lets you do anything you want manually (ISO, F-Stop, Exposure, Focus, Flash Power, etc.)<br /><br /> - Good feel: most smaller cameras feel flimsy and don't fit well with a grip, but its big enough to feel like a camera.<br /><br /> - Great picture quality.  3.2 Megapixel is plenty for any home photography, including being able to crop.<br /><br /> - 3x Optical zoom works great<br /><br /> - Uses CompactFlash, which is really cheap to upgrade.<br /><br /> - Uses 4AA's, so you don't have to switch batteries nearly as often, and has pretty good battery life.<br /><br /> - great panoramic software that's easy, and produces good results, even without using a tripod (though they reccomend using one)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br /> - A little large to put in a pants pocket.<br /><br /> - no swivel screen.  Consider the higher models if you want to do more artistic photography that involve holding camera at ground level or above head that have a swivel screen if you want to use the camera for these things.<br /><br />Overall, a great camera.  I have had mine for close to a year now, and my dad has two, one for work and one for home use.  We love this camera, and have had excellent results from it.  Great for someone who wants good quality photos from a camera that is easy enough for your wife to use, but has enough features to appease your desire to tweak with the pictures.","[Canon has discontinued sale of this model since the review was written. The A75 still may still be found in some retailers inventories - and factory reconditioned units are still available at great prices. You should still consider the A75 as a great entry level camera.]<br /><br />As a Defense Contractor, and the owner of a Canon Digital Rebel, I wanted a backup camera that would not cause much attention to be paid to me or my camera - here or in some parts of the world. Looking at price point and sharing of compact flash memory cards were two prime considerations in camera choice.<br /><br />I'm partial to Canon digital products. Fit, finish and performance at every level of purchase price make them dependable buys. I've not been disappointed in any of my 3 cameras, printers or 3 lenses purchased from Canon.<br /><br />The A75 camera takes marvelous daylight pictures - and pretty good flash pictures. It has enough control features to satisfy even advanced photographers like myself. With a Canon made underwater housing (purchased while scuba diving in Aruba WP-DC30 ... see my review) it allows me to go places no other camera I own will take me.<br /><br />Movie mode is limited. Although good for some - the picture quality and lack of zoom features says - get a camcorder! Redeye is a distinct problem in lowlight and all flash modes. The lens/flash position allows only a narrow angle of satisfactory picture taking. Redeye reduction might be effective -but I haven't seen it work acceptably. Plan to spend time in Photoshop or other software products to remove what the camera has created.<br /><br />Shutter and auto-focus lag time. Most disconcerting. Sometimes the camera hunts forever. Even in controlled circumstances - the processor speed (or lack thereof) becomes annoying. Most disappointing feature of this camera.<br /><br />Plan on purchasing Ni-Mh recharable AA batteries. This camera - while not a battery hog - will drain your wallet with non-rechargables. A spare (2nd) set is a good bet - if this is your only camera - and you take a lot of pictures.<br /><br />Case and lens ring wear is evident after 18 months of use. Dirt and grit can get into the zoom lens mechanism in high dirt/dust environments. A mini-vac or air blower bottle has become a permanent fixture in my camera kit.<br /><br />Buy a camera pouch that firmly holds the A75, and has a separate compartment for a spare set of 4 AA batteries. I share compact flash memory with my Digital Rebel. A 512mb high speed card - and you can shoot forever. 250-300 pictures in full quality on a 512mb card is possible.<br /><br />After 18 months of use - I'm more than satisfied. The camera is starting to be phased out by many retailers. A reconditioned A75 would make a great entry level camera at a great price.<br /><br />As critical as I've been - I LIKE this camera. Many 8x10's of grandchildren adorn our walls and those of our kids. Great pictures - sharp (enough) - if somewhat oversaturated color (makes snapshots look great) and a perfect camera to create and send e-mail photos. While still a great fan of my Digital Rebel, this camera has it's place in my equipment bag wherever I go.","I've had this camera for nearly a year now, and I couldn't be more pleased.  Unlike some of the smaller cameras, it feels like a \"real\" camera in the hand.  It takes beautiful pictures and is very easy to use.  I couldn't be more happy with it!","I've used Canon SLRs quite a bit and I was pleased to find out how much this little point and shoot has in common with its big brothers.<br /><br />Thirteen different shooting modes are easily accessed by the dial on top, giving the user total control. Naturally you would expect this camera to have a fully automatic modes, and it does. But, unlike many other point and shoot digitals, this Canon allows you to control the shutter, aperture, and focus manually.<br /><br />I am pleased with the lens on this camera, but it is not a stand-out feature. The zoom is adequate most of the time. Just don't expect it to catch any real macro or telephoto shots.<br /><br />Overall picture quality is excellent and colors are bright and accurate. You can now buy consumer digital cameras with 8 or more megapixel CCDs, but save your money. This camera's 3.2MP will be enough for 90% of consumers. Unless you do a lot of cropping or want to make prints bigger than 8x10, a camera like this one will do quite nicely.<br /><br />Some cost cutting on this camera led to a couple disappointments, but they were easily fixed. The included alkaline AA batteries lasted less than two days. I purchased a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and they have lasted much longer and can be recharged in 30 minutes. Also, the included Compactflash card is only 32MB. This means you can only take 22 high-resolution photos before the card is full. I purchased a 256MB CF card which allows me two take 242 high-resolution photos.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with this camera. If you are looking for an inexpensive point and shoot digital, this one has a lot of good features and is made very well.","The digital camera market is very vast these days, and after researching and reading the rave reviews of the A75 on amazon, my decision was an easy one.  The Canon Powershot A75 is a GREAT camera.  This was my first digital camera buying experience, and I am very impressed with the results.  It is very easy to figure out how to take the pictures and movies, and I am excited to figure out the different picture effects.  The best part about this camera is that I can upload the pictures and movies onto my computer easily with the USB cable and CD-ROM provided, so I can share them easily. I also love the size; it's small, but it has a gripping area where the batteries go in so you can hold it easily.  Overall, I love this camera and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to buy a Canon.","I got this camera for Christmas and am totally thrilled with it.  It takes supurb picutres, has the ability to do manual settings and it really tough.  One of my kids knocked it from the top of an old upright piano and it bounced off the leg of the piano and hit the floor.  Nothing wrong at all, it just kept on working.  I would recommmend the A75, A85, or A95 to anyone!","I just bought this camera because the cheaper Fuji I wanted was sold out. It is my first digital camera. Well am I ever glad I spent the extra $50, this camera is amazing. Upholding the good Canon name with flying colors. The first time I used it I got 75% amazing pics and 25% of not so good ones but I believe that was more operator error. Also I was photographing action so there are always a few that don't turn out. This camera takes pics that are better quality than some more expensive cameras. I would suggest it to anyone who is a 1st time digital user, its easy to use & takes great pictures.","There is so much to like about this camera that I don't know where to begin!  According to Consumer Reports, it has the best battery life on the market and the image quality is top-notch.  It's compact enough to fit in a shirt pocket, is loaded with extra functions and features, and for the price will not let you down!","I got my Canon A75 for Christmas and LOVE it. It's very easy to use, attractive, small, and takes great pictures. It's a great value, but I'd reccomend buying a bigger memory card with it!","I am a beginner in digital photography. Plus I had never bought a camera online before- after doing extensive research I finally decided to buy the PowerShot- and have not regretted it. All I did was follow the super easy instructions. Nothing to it-just follow the instructions and you will have no problems. You will not regret it.","I've owned this camera for 6 months and taken it on a trip round the world, so I've got to know it quite well. Here are the pro's and con's:<br /><br />Good points:<br /><br />------------<br /><br />+ Picture quality is excellent for the price.<br /><br />+ Flexiblility. This is the main thing that appealed to me about this camera (and still does). It has all the settings of my old SLR Canon A1 (i.e. shutter speed or aperture priority, manual mode) plus a load of new digital ones (e.g. black and white, sepia, vivid etc...).<br /><br />+ Battery life is very good if you get some decent rechargeables.<br /><br />+ Nice big, crystal clear screen.<br /><br />+ Uses flash memory, which seems cheaper than the other formats.<br /><br />+ Movie mode is good fun and surprisingly good quality on the high setting.<br /><br />Bad Points:<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />- A little bit bulky.<br /><br />- I've noticed that the image through the viewfinder and the screen don't always match. The one on the screen is the accurate one, which is annoying as in bright conditions it's not always easy to see.<br /><br />- Works best in light conditions. I find it sometimes struggle to get the exposure right when using the flash. So use a tripd where you can.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />-------<br /><br />A very versatile (and quite tough) camera that with a little effort gets great results. I would'nt recommend it for people just looking for a point and click, there are plenty of smaller, lighter cameras that will take just as good pictures. This camera is perfect, however, for people who like using SLR's and want a digital camera that lets you experiment a little whilst still producing excellent pictures.","The Cannon A75 is a great little camera, but the zoom lens at its widest is about equivalent to a normal 55mm lens on a 35mm camera.  If you're planning on using the wide angle lens attachment you may be in for a disappointment: The add-on lens blocks part of the optical viewfinder, so you have to rely on the lcd screen.  The screen is fixed and sometimes impossible to see in bright light. On the other hand, when using the lens attachment in low-light situations you'll find that the lens blocks the built-in flash.  If you need a digital camera with wide angle capabilities, this is not the one for you.","I bought the A75 because I wanted to upgrade to a digital camera that had some control over the manual settings, but didn't want to spend a mountain of cash.  This camera is everything I hoped it would be, and more.  It's small and comfortable to hold, and it packs a big punch of features. I was previously a point and shooter all the way, so I'm new to manual settings, but I haven't shot anything in auto mode since I bought this camera a month ago.<br />Set up properly, it takes awesome shots in almost every scenario you can throw at it.  If you are interested in learning manual controls, there is no better camera out there for the money that can do what this one can.<br />If you're someone who just wants to strictly point and shoot, it's still a great choice because the image quality is right up there.  When you feel comfortable with the camera, you can then experiment with the manual controls and I guarantee you will want to keep learning more. Oh and the movie mode rocks too. I'd hook up with at least a 128MB or better memory card though because it only comes with a 32MB card and if you take shots at the superfine rez, you won't have alot of room for images on the 32 meg card.  I'd also recommend at least one set of 2300 mah batteries. I got two sets plus a 3 hr. Maha charger that works like a champ.<br /> You definitely won't be disappointed with this camera, and CF memory is reasonably priced, so a larger card won't cost you a mint.  I put 4 pages of images online from this camera. You can view them at [...]<br /><br /> Bottom line is, the Canon A75 will not disappoint if you just take the time to LEARN how to use it...start by reading the manual. These people who are saying they've got fuzzy images are not setting up the camera properly, and probably have the digital zoom engaged, which will produce fuzzy looking photos.  As you may know from research, digital zoom is just hype and pretty useless.  It's not rocket science folks, rtfm and you'll get great shots from this canon.  You do have to hold these cameras still, or again, you'll get crappy looking images.  As I said, check out my gallery at the link included above and see for yourself what awesome images this thing produces. You can't get a better digital for this price!","Hi, I previous owned a Canon A40, and I was very satisfy with that camera, I really liked it. Later I upgraded to this one (A75): More pixels (from 2 to 3.2), Large viefinder (1.8\"), more video capacity (up 3 min) and extra stuffs. But I was very surprised not to see what I was expecting ... The pictures were fussy, a lot of Red Eyes (even with the red eye reduction On), quality not so good in some cases.<br /><br />I'm a snapshooter and all I want is to put in Auto (Large and Superfine) and take pics, But i didn't like how they looked like, specially in dark situations it was very dissapointing to me.<br /><br />The movie option is very good, up to 30 sec in Large (640x480) .. up 3 min. in smaller format. You can edit them directly in the camera and hear them. Nice!<br /><br />I sold it, I'm going to continue with Canon beacause i think they're the best, now i'm going to buy the A400 and see.","it's not the best digital camera but with decent price it has so much features and great for snap shots with your friends","I bought this camera online from Target about 2 months ago and I love it!  It has many differant features that make it great to work with.  There are a few drawbacks but they are minor... It takes regular AA batteries and can suck the life out of those quite fast, so I would reccomend you buy rechargeables for this bad boy; The auto focus isn't that great so sometimes you end up with a blurry picture.  Also when you take video in dim light it shows up kind of dark since there is no light on the camera... But it is an otherwise great camera.  This is the first Digital camera I have purchased for myself, I have used many I just didn't own one... LoL  It has been wonderful for catching all the special moments I have with my son.  Two thumbs WAY WAY up!!  :)","I didn't know if I was going to be overwhelmed with all of the options and modes on this camera, but within a few days I had nearly everything figured out (without opening the manual).<br /><br />From what I've seen from other digital cameras, this one has very good all-around picture quality. On other digital cameras that I've borrowed from friends, they would have great outdoor pics but terrible indoor or night pics, or visa versa depending on the camera. The A75 has (from what I've been able to tell) the best overall picture quality for a camera under $300.<br /><br />Also, shutter lag is pretty good with this camera, although some of the newer cameras in this price range are better.<br /><br />Overall, I couldn't be happier.","i got an a75. it has tons of stuff/features/modes. i dont even know most of it. but the video (mpegs) are nice and have good audio. id say the negatives are:<br /><br />the size/weight, especially compared with some of the slim ones out now.<br /><br />it needs 4 AA batteries. i have rechargeable. u might want to look into them.<br /><br />and when u snap to take a pic, it takes like 2-3 seconds to actually take the pic. kind of annoying/awkward to sit there trying to hold the camera steady for a few seconds while pushing down on the button.<br /><br />the pics are clean though.","I purchased this camera for my wife for Christmas after doing a heck of a lot of research.  Let me share with you the reasons I chose the A75:<br /><br />1) Resolution:  With digital cameras getter \"better\" all the time 3.2 mp does not seem like a real high quality photo anymore.  This is not true for the average camera user.  I have a 2.1 mp Olympus that I blow up to 8X10 with no noticable loss of clarity.  I am sure that the 3.2 will follow suit and is sufficient for the use of the wife.  The main thing to remember is that the higher the pixel resolution, the larger the file size as a trade-off.<br /><br />2) Batteries - I am a firm believer of the AA NiMH batteries and thier associated chargers.  I was able to get the wife an Engrgizer charger with eight batteries for about $20, which will last forever.  The other nice thing is that in a pinch any set of AA batteries, available literally anywhere, will keep you shooting.<br /><br />3) Storage media - I prefer the compact flash media for one main reason, durability.  The hard case with no external contacts make for a long lasting memory card.  I personnaly like the size as well since some of the newer cards are so small they would be easily misplaced.  The second reason I like compact flash is cost.  [...]<br /><br />4) Size -  The wife loves the way the A75 fits in her hand, unlike my Olympus.  The battery area forms a nice handle on the right side of the camera which fits her small hands just right.  The over all compactness of the camera is great too.  I figure the smaller the camera, the more likely we will actually have it with us to take pictures.<br /><br />4) Brand - It's a Canon, after all.  Nuff said about that...<br /><br />5) Features - I have barely explored half of what the camera is capable of, but I am surprised at the depth it offers.  Yet, the automatic mode is simple enough for the wife to \"point and shoot\" with exellent results.<br /><br />That's about it, I recommend this camera, from Amazon.com, to anyone looking to buy today!<br /><br />Update August 2008:  The camera died a week before Christmas 2007.  It lasted three years with pretty regular use, so I guess it is not bad.  We replaced it with a newer Canon.","Canon A75 stands out for its performance and cost. It is the best entry level digital camera out there in the market. The pictures come out clean and crisp if you use it outdoor. Sometimes, I get blurred images when the lighting is not too good. But that does not happen always. The camera looks sleek and stylish. The user interface is easy to understand without reading the manual. Btaerry life is very very good. I was able to take aroun 200 pictures with LCD turned on always. It uses Compact Flash -Type I cards which are cheap as dirt. Optical zooom is good, but images get blurred if you use digital zoom(which is understandable).<br /><br />Overall a must buy if you are looking to get an entry level digital camera that is worth having for 3 years and only wish to spend $200.","This is my first digital camera, so I can't really make any expert comparisons to other cameras. However there are a few things worth noting.<br /><br />The image quality is definitely fantastic, especially for a 3 megapixel camera, and for anyone who does casual shooting (not for professional purposes) its more than adequate.<br /><br />Some people claim the video mode is weak, but in my opinion its very good. Good capture quality, sound and enough features. It would be nice if you could capture as much video as the memory card could hold however.<br /><br />I have heard one of the main cons of the camera is how long it takes after pressing the button to actually take the picture. I thought this was going to be a problem for me, but after trying it, I hardly noticed. It actually comes as an advantage, because when pressing the button, you exert force on the camera, and this can cause motion, so by the time camera is back in perfect position it takes the picture and it comes out fine. It may sound like a long time, but really its only about 1 second or less.<br /><br />The camera build quality is very good, it feels strong and somewhat heavy, which may be a problem for shirt pockets, but it feels good.<br /><br />In comparison to another camera I have used within the same price range and also 3.2 megapixels (I will not name the brand), it is like 10x better.  This is a very basic and simple review, so for those of you who just need a good midrange digital camera and welcome the extra features and obviously the great overall quality, this is a must buy.","Bought this camera 2 weeks back. But used another one for a month. This camera rocks. For [...](on Amazon) you can't beat it with any other in its class or even till 5 megapixel (unless you want larger then 8x10 prints).<br />I,like most of you reading this review, agonised over which one to buy. It is just frustrating. There are so many options out there and after a while brain just gives up. My shortlist looked something like this : A75,A95,Fuji E550(6.3 mp , $250 after rebate at buydig.com)<br />A95, IMO, has more noise than A75. Also its bulky and it always shakes while pushing bit too hard snap button. Only great thing with this one is its swivel LCD. Resolution on LCD is extremely good. I liked images more on it than my flat panel PC monitor.<br /><br />E550, seems to be excellent price as well, for 250 after rebate, this one is too tempting. But I thought Canon powershot is safer buy. Just because so many people have bought it and have given good reviews.<br /><br />A75 is loaded with features, for the price it just offers unbelievably rich feature set. It has Aperture,shutter,manual mode, exposure compensation, white balance compensation, 3 metering modes, tons of special situation modes, addictive photostitching mode.<br /><br />Image quality is excellent. I could not believe how crisp images it produces. Color are vivid, shadow details are great. In fact I think, colors are little more satuaated than they are. You dont need polariser to get a dark blue sky.<br /><br />Battery life is amazing, around 400 images with LCD on and moderate use of review mode.<br /><br />This review caan go on and on, just because I am impresses a lot with this camera. I just hope this lasts good. Body is plastic and I am scared of this E14... error people keep mentioning.<br /><br />To summarize, I would say , if you are looking for a digital camera that you can comfortably carry anywhere and take good quality pictures then search no further. Just buy this one you will not regret.<br /><br />PS. Buy lens adapter and Tiffen 3 filter set to save shipping, also a canon case ($5)","Unforutnately we did not heed the warnings; the compact flash slot on these cameras is NOT good.  Brand new out of the box it was defective, which is a common complaint.  Canon must do something about this, because it is otherwise a fantastic camera, for a great, great price.  We will likely buy another Canon (they make good digital), or try again.","This review will be short and sweet.  There are a lot of great detailed reviews here about every feature . . . I'm going to just talk about what I think matters with this camera.<br /><br />#1 - Picture Quality.  I have a HP 2.1 MP camera that I just used to take a picture of my sons under the Christmas tree, then printed it out on photo paper.  When I got my Canon A75 camera, I took the same picture of them, then printed it out.  The difference was stunning!  The color and quality of the Canon printed picture was 10x better than the HP.  It looked like a photo center picture.<br /><br />#2 - Software.  It's okay, but not the best. For organizing and viewing after downloading, it's fine. I wanted to print a picture, and all I could find was Album printing and \"contact sheet\".  It didn't give me size option (4x6, 5x7, etc.)  I ended up using my HP Printer software.<br /><br />#3 - Fun Stuff.  There are some fun things - like sounds.  When you are in the Canon software, you can go to \"My camera options\" and change the sounds and opening screen picture (while your camera is connected).  I have a nice Christmas scene for the opening picture and some cute Christmas sound effects.  They have other themes like baseball, cats/dogs, wedding, etc.<br /><br />#4 - My biggest problem with this camera is shutter speed.  It takes a few seconds to actually take a picture.  By the time my kids are done saying \"CHEESE\" the picture snaps.  So I've learned to tell them to say cheese a second after I push the button.  I have a feeling I'm going to miss some good shots because of this issue.<br /><br />#5 - Batteries.  Sure, it eats batteries, but all digital cameras do.  But comparing it to my HP, the Canon A75 lasts twice as long.  And does even better with a good set of rechargable batteries.<br /><br />I would surely recommend this camera.  It has amazing quality and a ton of features for the price.","I just got my A75, and I must say I'm thoroughly impressed. I've been taking pictures ever since I was 10 (my first camera was a Kodak 126 cartridge model with the flip flash). We have a Canon EOS digital Rebel, which is awesome. That said, I wanted something smaller to tote around, and the A75 fills the bill nicely.<br /><br />Initial Impressions<br />This baby is ready to use right out of the box. Although reading the manual is advisable prior to using any new gear, I found the camera's controls to be quite intuitive (perhaps owing to my experience with the EOS). Once you install the included batteries and 32mb CF card, you're ready to start taking pictures. There are many options for various shooting situations (sport mode, portrait, etc.), as well as a \"scene\" mode for more specialized scenarios such as \"snow\", \"fireworks\", and \"foliage\". The creative zone settings enable the most control I've ever seen in a camera of this class, all the way down to full manual exposure and focus control. Using manual controls can make the camera work faster. For example, go into manual mode, set the focus around 2 feet and f2.8. Everything from 2 feet to infinity will be in focus, and you can zing off hip shots quickly. Although there is no metering in manual mode, the LCD will preview your shot (if your settings are wrong the preview will look too dark, too light, or too blurry). Exposure compensation controls are quickly accessible in most modes. There are three different metering modes, you can adjust the ISO rating of the sensor, and choose from one of several color balance presets (tungsten, fluorescent, etc.), and even define your own. It's got a rapid-fire mode, and can even take short videos with sound. The more you read the manual and play with this camera, the deeper you can get into the feature set, and it's pretty dang deep. Quite a lot of bang for the buck.<br /><br />PROS<br />1. Excellent image quality.<br />2. Ease of use.<br />3. Lots of features in a relatively small package.<br />4. High overall quality, good solid feel.<br />5. Uses standard AA batteries.<br /><br />CONS<br />1. Size and weight not quite suitable for shirt pocket. Jacket pocket or purse will be fine.<br />2. Some shutter lag, which varies depending on selected mode. Not bad for a camera of this type, but certainly not on a par with, say, an SLR.<br /><br />Although the A75 comes with software, I must recommend Adobe Photoshop Elements. It has a very nice capture feature and photo-organizer that makes managing your image library a pleasure. The editing features are quite extensive, and easy to use with many tutorials and liberal assistance. It's even got a feature that can stitch together the \"photo stitch\" panoramas from the A75. All in all, PS Elements works a treat with the A75 (and the EOS, for which it offers RAW file support).","I got lucky with my very first digital camera; I bought the Canon Powershot A40 and haven't looked back.  Now I'm upgrading for the 3rd time to the A75 (the A85 is just too much).  Here's the amazing thing: with the last two PowerShots (A40 and A60), I took *over 5500* pictures and neither one coughed once.  I sold the A40 6 months ago (after 4000 pics) and the current owner says it's still running like a champ.  This line of digital cameras is the best thing going for the price.  My Dad and brother both seem to insist on buying Nikon cameras.  Then, every time we get together for the holidays, all I hear is \"I wish my camera did that\" or \"Can I get a copy of your picture?  It looks better.\"  This camera sports features that even $400 cameras don't (I know, because I gave the other manufacturers an honest chance to get me to leave Canon this time, but they just couldn't offer anything comparable).<br /><br />Now, I'm no dummy when it comes to photography.  I've been an SLR user for many, many years (currently, I have a Canon EOS Rebel).  Unfortunately, digital SLR's are still too expensive.  I bought the Powershot because of the full manual mode (I do a lot of astrophotography and this is perfect for it).  I have total control over the settings.  Combined with a 52mm lens adapter, this camera satisfies 90% of my SLR cravings.  The pictures are consistently crisp and well exposed.  I rarely encounter a situation where the PowerShot isn't able to rock and roll.  Battery life is stunning.  I routinely get 500 pictures with the LCD on and maybe 30% flash (I have 2100 mAh NiMHs).  Added features such as 600x480 movies, a really sharp panoramic mode (photos are \"stitched\" together on the computer), manual white-balancing option, histograms, manual focus, aperture/shutter priority modes and PictBridge printing are icing on the cake.<br /><br />The one con I've found is that the Powershot line seems to perform a bit sluggishly in low-light conditions, often requiring a few seconds to get a decent reading.<br /><br />This really is THE best camera in its class(IMO and that of many \"professional\" reviewers).  If you search for a certain price or megapixel resolution and a Powershot \"A\" line is included in the results, buy it.  You won't be sorry at all.  If you buy one of the others, you'll honestly pay too much.","For the price, this is a very good camera.  Image quality is great but can be improved by manually tweaking the settings.  The shutter lag is about average, but I had hoped that it could have been a tad faster.  Burns through 4 AA's batteries very quickly (lasted one day when using flash) so the other reviewers' recommendations to use rechargeable NiMH are right on.  Be aware that Canon cameras sometimes have a problem with the lens mechanism which results in the dreaded E18 error.  If the warranty has ended, the cost to fix is very expensive.  Since this is an old problem, I can only blame Canon for not addressing this issue in the later models.","To preface this, I own a Digital Rebel (or, in some locales, the 300D).  I love my rebel.  It loves me.  That said, the Rebel is hardly portable or handy.<br /><br />I originally picked up the A75 for my 9 year old son.  I figured, the user interface is vaguely like my camera, it uses the same memory, and uses standard AA batteries (something we have in abundance at this house).  And, it was fairly simple to use - a great intro camera, to get him started.<br /><br />As it turns out, I liked it so much, that I ended up buying a second one for myself.<br /><br />Things I like:<br /><br />- User interface is not far off from my Rebel<br /><br />- Completely operable by my 9 year old<br /><br />- Manual controls for exposure, aperature, iso speed, focus all available (!)<br /><br />- Video clip recording is not half bad!<br /><br />- White balance OK at automatic - and easy to set a custom value<br /><br />- Flash exposure is decent for being a P&S camera -  especially for a Canon<br /><br />Things that could be improved:<br /><br />- The grip is big; a bit awkward to stick in your pocket.  If this bugs you, look at the Elph.<br /><br />- Response times to focus and snap are slightly slower than average, but not bad.<br /><br />- The bundled memory is too small.  Buy at least 512 megs.","This is a great little camera with lots of features for the price.<br /><br />It is easy to use and handle.  I love that it can take regular AA batteries, that can be very convenient!  Canon is a reputable company and once again they've made me happy!","Canon Powershot A75 made my day. I was planning on buying a digital camera for myself for sometime. After long search and frustrating analysis, I decided on Powershot A95. Got one through Amazon. I returned it the very next day.. I was not satisfied with the pictures. Probably it's my fault. But still..I was not impressed.<br /><br />My wife and I are planning to gift two digital cameras for our parents.. and not to buy similar ones for apparent reasons.. budget is about $200. So I went for Powershot A75 (canons are always my favorite) and she picked Kodak 4530. (mind that Kodak 4530 is a 5 MP camera). After comparing the pictures and various other things, she returned her Kodak 4530 and got A75. The picture quality is crisp. I am still wondering on why A95 disappointed me.<br /><br />Bottomline is if you are looking for a affordable ($200 range) but good camera.. Go for this one. Oh! another point to add.. I compared Nikon 4200.. I tested this NIkon piece in Circuit city and figured that it takes few seconds in recording a picture. That is there is a wait period between when you take a picture and you can go for the next one. [..]<br /><br />Go for it and you wont be disappointed.","I gave my Nikon Coolpix 2000 to a friend and started shopping for another 3Mp point-and-shoot in the $200 price range.  I use a Minolta DiMage 7Hi for my serious picture taking.  After looking at the Olympus D540 zoom, and Nikon Coolpix 3200, I settled on the Canon PowerShot A75.<br /><br />All of the other reviewers are correct in assessing the pros and cons for this camera.  The 3X Optical Zoom is great, but the zoom ring is located on top of the camera around the shutter release.  Takes some getting used to since the Coolpix 2000 zoom lever is on the back within easy thumb range.  Another plus is the camera has both an LCD screen and a more conventional conventional viewfinder.  After 25 years of composing through a viewfinder, I'm used to it, and use the LCD screen to review my pics and check and adjust the camera settings.  Even though I plan to use it primarily as a point-and-shoot, there are lots of options for manual adjustments, more than you would expect for a camera at this size and price.<br /><br />What finally sold me on this camera, was that it takes CF memory cards, and I already have several that I use with the Minolta and the Nikon.  Therein lies the only problem so far, since my memory card reader, built into my PC, will not read the 32Mb card that came with the camera.  But, the cards I already own work just fine.<br /><br />This is a great second camera for the enthusiast, and a great entry level camera for someone making the switch to digital photography and is used to having more control over the camera settings.  Beware the learning curve, though.<br /><br />Highly recommended.","I was just looking for the right camera and I found it!<br /><br />when I first took photos with this camera I was not a<br /><br />person who love to take pictures but this baby made me<br /><br />see that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Now i cannot<br /><br />stop shooting on my days off. The pros images are great<br /><br />and you can purchase a LA-DC52C to use teleconverter, Wide Angle<br /><br />or UV Filters which gives you room to grow with your A75.","Canon made a great camera and I had only used this for a day however in 1 day I went through the batteries. But this seems to be very comon in digital cameras I know a few more people who have HP's and Kodak's who's cameras both do the same thing. So I'm not that upset. This camera is easy to use and takes great pictures. I didn't even have to look at the manual except for looking at the correct way to put the batteries in. I then plugged the camera into the computer with the USB and it worked with the current software I had on my computer. So I din't even have to add more.<br /><br />Thanks Canon,<br /><br />for making a great digital camera!","I just purchased this camera for my mom for Christmas, and I decided to try it out before I gave it to her. I LOVE this camera, it is definately the best buy for the money. The color is great, and it is light, easy to use, and the batteries last fairly long. My 7 year old son took some awesome pictures on the Auto setting. It is a great camera for non-professionals that want great famliy pictures and more. Sorry mom I might have to keep this one!","handy, nice picture quality but batteries don't last long...<br /><br />I would suggest rechargeable batteries with it","If you're like me, you live for those rare moments when you just know you've spent your money wisely. I must tell you that from the moment I purchased this camera and began using it, I have had a perpetual grin. You quite simply cannot do better on a camera in this price range. It kicks [...]! I'll leave the technical stuff to others but suffice to say this takes great pictures, is intuitively designed, and the software included is incredibly easy to use and packed with features. I love this thing!","I really like my camera.  It takes great pictures.  The only problem that I have is the batteries.  I purchase new batteries and they don't seem to work.  I usually have to go thru several AA batteries before the camera actually turns on.  It's quite fustrating when you put new batteries and nothing works.  I suggest getting the battery charger although I do not have one myself but am considering it.","WOw this is a great camera.It is fairly cheap, and for the money you pay, you get a great camera that is perfect for novice and intermediate photographers.you can buy many upgrade for this camera, like zoom lenses, wide angle lenses, underwater cases, tripods, and printers.I would highly reccomend this camera to anyone who needs a digital camera thats not a billion dollars.","My first digital camera was a Kodak DC3200 that was purchased two years ago that I am very pleased with and still works to this day.  However, the door to the battery compartment no longer closes so I have to use rubber bands tied around the camera to keep the batteries in place (annoying); the batteries are always falling out!  The other problem was the lag time between when you actually press the button and the seconds that pass before the image is actually recorded.  This is problematic because I mostly take pictures of my toddler who is always in motion.<br /><br />This is where the Canon A75 enters the picture.  I did not want to spend a fortune.  I do not have to have the biggest and the best.  My list of requirements in a digital camera is as follows:  minimal lag time, built-in zoom, point-and-shoot capability, crisp photographs, and affordable price.  The Canon A75 fit the bill perfectly!<br /><br />I've only had my Canon for a few weeks now, so I cannot comment on its durability.  So far I've only taken pictures using the \"Auto\" setting and I've gotten some great shots!  This camera is super-easy to use.  I immediately changed the resolution to the lowest setting (640x480 pixels) and the pictures come out the perfect size for emailing with no re-sizing required.<br /><br />If, like me, you are simply looking for a great little camera to take shots of your kids, pets, holidays, etc, I don't think you can go wrong with the Canon A75!  Sure, you can pay more and get 5 megapixels and whatnot, but why, when this camera does the trick?!!","If you're looking for a moderately priced digicam with manual features to flex your artistic side I don't think you can go wrong with Canon's A75. With a sub $200 retail price this go any where camera beats larger megapixel competitors with better color fidelity and expansive manual controls. However there are a few flaws in the design. Although you get a low battery indicator a battery meter is missing. This kind of makes you guess how much juice you have left before the low battery warning comes on. Not a deal breaker but a weird design flaw that should be remedied. The plastic door for the memory slot is a bit flimsy in design but does its job well. As a matter of fact the whole camera is made of plastic. I don't think this is a design flaw since it is high quality plastic and does reduce it's overall weight but does have a bit of a cheap feel to it. For anyone getting this camera as a first digital you NEED to buy 2 things. A larger CF memory card. Don't waste your money on ultra speed products. There's only a hand full of prosumer digicams that can take advantage of the extra speed, save your money and buy more megabytes. A 512MB CF card is nice but a 1GB card is better. Some people might think this is over kill but when you're not limited in the number of pictures you can take you can really start having fun and sort out the true winners out of them all. Another must is a couple of sets (pair of 4 AAs) of rechargeable NiMH AA batteries and a good charger. Don't get cheap here as there is a real difference in the amount of pictures you can take between an 1850mAh and 2300mAh batteries. Maha and energizer make dependable batteries. As for chargers the best is made by Maha. One last note about the Canon A75. As with any digital camera check for \"dead\", \"stuck\" or \"hot\" pixels in the CCD. You know you have it if you see any red or white pixels that show up in most or all of your shots. If you see this send it back for an exchange. Happy shooting.<br /><br />Sam","One of the reason I give this five stars is because this camera is cheap for all of its features. I just bought this recently and the you can be as creative as you like! If you are beginning then just switch it to auto and snap away, but if you want to be creative, go ahead and mess around with it! The photo stitch mode is awsome and makes cool pics! The battery life is another great thing about this camera, it last the whole day, literally! But when you buy your memory card make sure to by at least a 128mb so you don't have to worry about erasing cute pics. But the 32mb card it comes with is a special bonus! I took 27 pics and a 30 second movie all on that one little card.  One more thing is the movies. They're nearly as good as my $800 mini video camera. Anyway I really recommend this camera for anybody! Good Luck!","This is my first digital camera. The 4 & 5MP models are nice and some feature long zooms, however you are going to spend 2-3X+ the price of this one. I bought the A75 due to it's review in Consumer Reports and also due to it's price drop. Canon got great marks for fewer repairs, which is very important. When I first saw it in the store I was impressed w/ it's small size. I bought a small case for it also. Buy yourself a good set of rechargeable NimH batteries w/ a fast charger and for the fastest transport to your PC consider a USB 2.0 memory card reader. It's \"pict bridge\" compatible, so it plugs directly into my printer & the USB cable's in the box! Talk about easy prints. The 3.2 is perfect for 4x6 & 5x7s. Some of it's features include: 3x optical zoom, real image viewfinder, 1.8\" LCD, great battery life, compact flash type I memory, manual controls, and AA batteries. My sole complaint is a minor design issue, I wish there was a removable hard plastic cover for the lens (for better protection). I'm disappointed Canon doesn't give you the a/c adapter also. Another way to make more money I guess. In closing, I'm confident I got a great camera at a great price. Thanks Canon! The A75 rocks!","I just entered the world of digital cameras and I am NOT disappointed that I purchased this Canon A75.  It is a great little point and shoot camera.  With the \"Auto\" focus to help those who just want a great shot or the manual focus for more custom pictures, this A75 is the one. Lots of modes to choose from and it also has 6 special modes (even one for fireworks & underwater shots).  It can hook up with just a printer, your PC or TV to veiw your perfect picture.<br /><br />Consumer Report Magazine has also rated this 3.2 meg in the top 5 for performance, battery life, features & repair history in it's class.<br /><br />I originally was going to purchase another brand.  I'm glad I took the time to review and shop around for this camera.  I know it'll be one of my best purchases.","I bought this camera 5 weeks ago and so far had lots of fun and taken good pictures.  I am very happy with the software & the features that it offers.  I have been able to take pictures manually and I was amazed at the results.  The photostich capability is also very cool ,because I was truly able to take 180 & 240 degree pictures.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this for anyone, who does not want to spend a lot of money and takes a lot of pictures for on-line albums.","I got this camera as a replacement for my Kodak DC 280, which is a very good and reliable camera.<br /><br />I am really pleased with it, although you have to get familiarized with the buttons and setting up the features.<br /><br />Things I like:<br /><br />Different resolutions that fit to your needs, whether it's quality or memory space.<br /><br />It includes a 1024X768 resolution enabling you to display your pictures in full size as your wall papers.<br /><br />Flash modes include elimination of red eye.<br /><br />Self Timer 2 or 10 secs. The second option is best if you want to be in the picture.<br /><br />Can connect to your TV so you can share the pictures with friends who don't have a computer and with out the need of printing them.<br /><br />You can record video clips, but I rather use my camcorder for that.<br /><br />Up to 3.2 megapixels<br /><br />Optical Zoom, beacuse digital zooms affect the image.<br /><br />Includes USB for computer and AV cables for TV or VCR to record your picture slideshows on videotape.<br /><br />PRICE: NOW IT IS UNDER 200 DOLLARS<br /><br />Compact Flash Cards are the cheaper memory cards in the market, and also my fomer camera uses this media so I save in getting more flash memory.<br /><br />32 MB COMPACT FLASH CARD INCLUDED other cameras include only 16 MB media cards<br /><br />Recommendations:<br /><br />Battery Charger and rechargable Batteries. It is better to use rechargable batteries with this cameras, they last longer and don't need to be buying often. You should have two sets for when one runs dry you change them.<br /><br />Card Reader. Nowadays computers include them. If you can buy a Compact Flash Reader or Universal one. It will help you save battery life and time,because you don't have to set up camera drivers to connect the camera to your computer or install the software included with the camera.<br /><br />This is definitely a great deal, considering you can only get 3.2 MP cameras under 200 dollars if the have a digital zooom instead of an optical one, and use more expensive memory cards, and by the way you also get a 32 MB card instead of the usual 16 MB included in the box. And I have forgotten to mention is not any camera is a Canon, a leader in the market. Whether you are starting in the digital camera world or have more experience this is a great deal.","I owned an A70 in the past and now I have an A80 and I just bought an A75 as a gift from Amazon and took many shots from it just for comparison.<br /><br />When I first started checking prices I found that the A75 was not the cheapest on Amazon, so I used the feature Amazon provides to let them know about a lower price at another online retailer (with shipping). And lo and behold, Amazon dropped the price of A75 by a whopping 40 dollars to make it the best deal available on the net.(Hats off Amazon!) Of course, I bought the camera at Amazon with the super saver FREE shipping it reached me 4-5 days later!<br /><br />I had loved my A70 and now A75 offers all that and more:<br />- A larger 1.8 inch LCD screen, what a difference it makes when you don't have to squint to see the image and it works better in low light situations too<br />- New SCN modes for quick shots of special scenes - Fireworks, Beach, Snow, Underwater (with the waterproof case), Foliage and Indoors. Now even amateurs can use Canon experience to get the best shot quickly before they miss the photo opportunity. I haven't had the opportunity to test out all the modes, but will report back with an update soon.<br />- Print share button to directly download/print from camera, though I don't think I will ever print the images directly from my camera<br /><br />I LOVE the new control buttons at the back, the way the SET button is now in the center of the up-down/forward-backward navigator buttons. Now, the navigator buttons are also clearly marked with arrows to avoid confusion. The overall feel is more ergonomic than the A70, which is great. A small gripe is that the rubber flap that covers the A/V out and Digital port is slightly larger than on my A80, but it is not very noticeable.<br /><br />What is great about the CANON A75 (which hasn't changed since the A70):<br />--A75 also offers 3 resolution settings for video including 640X480 (VGA max 30 sec). With yahoo/gmail etc. now allowing larger attachments, it is fun to send small clips of video to people.<br /><br />--Complete Manual functions available - shutter priority, Aperture priority, White balancing, Manual focusing etc.<br /><br />--Photostitch - For stitching together panoramic views. I have shot countless seascapes, 'bridge'scapes, landscapes etc using this function and stitching togehter 6-10 shots in one. It is really easy too with the software provided which does it intuitively!<br /><br />-- Tone settings (Tungsten, Sunlight, Cloudy etc.) which help correct the White balance<br /><br />--Special effects (B/W, Sepia, Vivid, Nuetral etc.) I have used sepia a lot when taking potraits giving them an 'old world' feel. Vivid has been helpful in special situations like a red kite against a blue sky to bring out the colors.<br /><br />--Free Canon software, which works well and allows you to edit images, photo-stitch images, make fun photos, maintain an album, change camera settings from your computer, subtitle and edit videos, upload images back to camera to transfer to another computer etc.<br /><br />--It uses AA batteries which are available anywhere in the world.<br />NOTE: A Sony Super Quick Charger (5 hours) with 4 rechargeable 2300mAH NiMH batteries is available for under $19 on Amazon! Charge these batteries upto 1000 times. I keep the LCD on for all my shots and usually I get 300-360 shots from each charge from the A75 including the battery power used to download these images to my computer with the USB cable and playing back these images for friends! That is quite a feat by Canon.<br /><br />--Macro mode - Great for close ups of children or product shots<br /><br />At the current price on Amazon it is quite simply one of the best cameras you can buy. First time digital camera buyers will find it very easy to use as will those who want to experiment a bit with the manual features available on the AXX range of Canon cameras. If you want a decent, reasonably priced camera that is versatile enough for photography buffs and gives you crystal clear 5X7 prints - go for this camera.<br /><br />About the complaints on this camera from other reviers-<br />E18 - I have had an A70 where I did get an E18 error once in a while but I just turned the camera on and off and it went away. I never had this problem on the A80 in 2 years and nor on the A75. So maybe Canon has taken care of it now.<br /><br />Quality of prints - I have had crystal clear prints from Canon, yes the pics look the same on the computer even if they are low resolution. So make sure you are using the larger modes like L /M1 when you want to print the pictures.<br /><br />Delayed response to pressing the 'take picture' button - ALL Canon Cameras have this as they send out an infra red beam to evaluate the light conditions, so you must hold the camera still 2-3 seconds after depressing the button. This feature gives perfect pictures each time but if you give your camera to strangers just tell them to hold it still 5 secs after they have pressed the button. After all the pic quality is worth the effort.<br /><br />So go on - get it NOW before it sells out around Christmas!","This is my first digital camera, bought after reading all the reviews on this site. I couldn't be happier with it.<br /><br />It's easy to use. The color rendition is excellent. The auto-focus isn't easily fooled. Battery life appears to be excellent, and it uses AAs, which are far better than the proprietary batteries used by some others (e.g., Kodak). I do use high-milliampere rechargeables and carry spares on a trip.<br /><br />It's small and light enough to take everywhere. The manual settings seem usable, though I doubt I'll ever take advantage of them, as the auto settings seem perfectly adequate.<br /><br />Once the software is installed on your PC, the images download automatically as soon as the USB cord is plugged into the camera. It's dirt simple and hasn't failed yet.<br /><br />I haven't seen all the other cameras on the market, but owning this one, I won't bother to look--it is great. If I find anything that makes me change my mind (I've owned it for about a month now), I'll post again.","After going through 5 digital cameras in about a month (this was my 6th), I am really thrilled! A fantastic camera, with awesome features. This is one camera which can satisfy both the novice as well as the advanced photographer. You can make the camera automatically adjust all the settings if you want to, or you can manually adjust all the settings. The LCD screen is 1.8\" big, and is cool. The best part is the batteries. It requires 4 AA batteries. With the 4 supplied by Canon, I took about 160 pictures, using the LCD a lot of the time. This was in addition to using it for playback, etc. This time, I am using the NiMH rechargables, and I have already taken about 200 pictures, again, using the LCD most of the time. Great job, Canon!!!!","The A75 and A85 are Excellent follow-ups of the A70, and offer some very nice improvements.  The most noticeable is the larger LCD, scene modes for those who don't like to tinker with the settings, \"C\" dial position to save your custom settings, and the print/share button to make things easier.  For those who don't know, scene modes are easy-to-access presets of a combination of manual adjustments, optimized for shooting in different situations such as when you are indoors, at the beach, taking shots of kids, shooting at night, or shooting fireworks, etc. The camera features full manual controls over shutter speed and aperture, manual focus, saturation, exposure compensation, custom white balance, ISO, metering, and a histogram in playback mode.  I know most people think they won't ever use some of these, but when you have an important shot that just isn't coming out, you'll be really glad you have it (or wish you did).  For those who don't know, control over shutter speed means you can use a fast shutter speed to capture fast action or you can use a slow shutter to avoid using a flash or for taking shots of night scenery.<br /><br />The areas where the Canon A75, A85, and A95 really excel at are:<br /><br />Being fairly small(small price tag too!) for a camera with this many features and having picture quality this good.<br /><br />Creative shooting:  this is a great camera for those who want to do creative shooting but can't afford to plop down $600+ for a Canon G6 or more for a Digital SLR.  It's got all of the most important controls, and with your memory card, you can do all the creative shooting and experimenting you want virtually free compared to using film.  It's even expandable with telephoto, wide angle, or close up conversion lenses and there's also the waterproof casing.<br /><br />All Canon cameras also come with an excellent software package that lets you stitch panoramic photos, retouch photos or rescue those that came out wrong, add special effect, and view thumbnails of pictures so you don't have to open them up to see what the picture looks like (good for those who are using an older version of windows, I know there are still a lot of you out there).  The best part is that it's free!  It does more than Kodak's software(which is pretty decent), you have to pay $20 to get the better version of Olympus's software, and Sony's editing software is pretty much non-existent.  Those who already have Photoshop won't be excited.<br /><br />For those of you who are concerned that the camera doesn't come with rechargeable batteries, don't worry, it's really not a big deal.  Good rechargeable AA's, type NiMH are super cheap at around $10-$15 for 4, compared to $50 for Lithium Ion battery packs, and at that price, everyone can afford a spare set, which is really important to have.  I've seen people who bought much crappier cameras at the same price, just because they came with rechargeable batteries - not a smart choice in my opinion.<br /><br />Yes, there is the problem with purple fringing, but it's not a very common problem and most people either don't know what it is or don't even know think it's much of a problem when they see it.  Some people think it looks cool.  With full control over aperture, you have the ability to get rid of it or at least reduce it.  Compared to the problems that other manufacturers have with their cameras, I'd take a bit of purple fringing over noise, soft/fuzzy images, and over-sharpening any day!<br /><br />If you want 5 megapixels of resolution, a very useful rotating LCD screen, and Flexi-Zone (lets you choose an area that is off-center to focus on), then look at the A95.<br /><br />Remember, Higher Megapixels do not always equal better picture quality, or better cameras.  The Canon A-series is a fine example of cameras that offer superior performance and picture quality over the competition and other higher price cameras.","I just made the switch to digital format photography. I've had this camera for about two weeks and love it! I always thought that high megapixels was the key to a good digitial camera, but there is really more to it than that.  After looking at many cameras, I think the A-75 takes better quality photos than many higher megapixel cameras.<br /><br />The camera is easy to operate right out of the box.  My wife, who doesn't quickly take to electronic devices, is taking photos and video without any problems.  She is even doing some more creative manual shots now (black and white feature is pretty cool).  I was suprised by the quality of photos and video and how easy it is to capture both types of media.  We looked at the A-80, but the price, video quality, and lcd size of the A-75 won out in the end.<br /><br />Despite some other reviews, I think the shutter delay is pretty short compared to other digicams.  We have a 2 year old and we are able to take photos quickly without loosing the shot.  The key is focus-locking (push the button half way down) before you shoot.<br /><br />We are taking many more good quality photos and video than we ever did with the old 35 mm and camcorder set-up.  The size allows you to take it anywhere. I don't think you will be sorry buying this.  Get rechargeable batteries and a larger memory card and you are ready to do some real cool things with the A-75.","Been using the Canon powershot a75 for almost a month now and my feelings are mixed. The camera is very simple to use and it's very easy to navigate from one setting to another using the mode dial on top of the camera. It is also very simple to quickly transfer images from the camera to your computer - just attach the usb cable to the camera and pc and the camera does the rest. When using the automode, the image quality is very good to excellent when taking photos outside on a bright sunny day. Subjects come out in-focus and the automatic exposure does a great job of getting the colors just right. Pictures taken indoors are also very good if the camera is close to the subject(within the range of the flash) although some of the shots come out slightly overexposed which is not a problem and can be easily fixed with minor tweaking and the camera set to program mode. Now for the bad. The auto-mode is practically useless when taking night shots or even some shots taken on very cloudy days or in areas where there tend to be lots of shadows. The pictures come out very noisy. Apparently the camera increases the ISO value to compensate for the low-light condition and the larger the ISO value the greater the amount of noise in the picture. As mentioned above, it seems to increase the ISO value even on cloudy days or in shadowy areas leading to noisy pictures. I have minimized the affect of noise in low-light conditions by using the cameras program mode and setting the ISO value to its lowest setting which is 50 on this camera. This dramatically reduces the noise. The problem of noise seems to be a problem on all digital cameras in this category and  price not just the canon a75. If your searching for a camera that will give you less noise look for one that has a bigger sensor (1/1.8\" instead of 1/2.7\") although that will cost more. I've been looking at the canon a80 which has a bigger sensor and the pictures seem to come out not as noisy. Another bad part of the camera is that it is impossible to see the LCD screen when the sun is very bright. The folks at Canon should've coated the LCD with an anti-reflection coating to minimize the glare. But anyway what matters most is the picture quality which is good but not great. So to summarize although I really like this camera, the noisy pictures in dark conditions (in auto mode) led me to give it 4 stars. Can someone recommend a good digital camera that is noise free? For sample pictures from all these digital cameras check out the following web site -[...]","My Cannon A75 view finder in the back was fuzzy and not working properly.  I sent it to their Customer service center and it was fixed free of charge and returned to me via Fed EX next day air in 8 days.  That alone will keep me buying their products and spreading the good word on them.","Easy menu's, great pictures.<br /><br />I can see the LCD and menu's very easy. But most important Canon stands behind the camera, After having 2 months my camera was dropped on carpet less than 2 feet with the lens open. To my horror lens did not operate! Sent in to Canon repair they replaced lens under waranty, NO charge working great! I will stick with canon from now on.","Over the past several years, I've gone through a lot of Digital Cameras...Kodak DC3400 (great for its time), Minolta Dimage 7hi (good for its time), Sony DSC-F828 (terrible -- very high noise level), Canon A70 (great), Canon A75 (see below), and Nikon D70 (love the D70).  For the high-end, the Nikon is incredible.  For the low-end, my all-time favorite has been the Canon A70.<br />I liked it so much, that when my first one was stolen on vacation, I purchased another one.  It has the best feature set of any digital camera under $300.<br />Unfortunately, my second Canon A70 took a swim at a water park...and was never quite the same.  So I replaced my A70 with the A75 this month.<br />Almost everything appeared equal between the A75 and A70.  And the Picture quality continued to be very good for both.  However, this camera has one show-stopping problem that I cannot live with.  It has the worst auto-focus mechanism of any digicam I've owned.  I take lots of pictures of my kids, and the A75 cannot keep up with them.  What I can't understand is how did Canon make the auto-focus worse in the A75 than the A70?<br />I compared my A75 with floor models at a local electronics chain, and discovered they were all equally poor.  I've since returned the camera and am now searching for a suitable $300 replacement.","I am very happy with this camera, The A75 has excellent image quality, Canon's new DIGIC processor does its job very well, The Canon AiAF autofocus system is more or less a joke, But this camera has plenty of manual controls to get excellent results, The macro mode is cool, Get the accessories and lens adapters and you are into a new world of Marco Photography, Many other cameras use a proprietary lithium-ion battery pack. It's nice to be able to use rechargeable or \"off the shelf\" batteries in this camera, Battery life with NiMH 2200mah or better is excellent, This camera is a great combination of well balanced performance, Excellent image quality and ease of use, all at a very affordable price. Go get it..!!","I just received my Canon A75 Camera yesterday, And I have already been using it on a regular basis. I have viewed my pictures on th TV sreen, downloaded them to my computer, made a slide show & more.The manual is very good with describing how do do things. I have yet to get into the camera's more advanced features, but I have looked into a few of them, and it was very simple and straight forward. The quality of the pictures are great, I even did a quick film, complete with sound. I looked into Digital Cameras for a while, and for the money, this is a can't miss camera.","I've had this camera for a while now, hacve never experienced any problems with it, and LOVE IT!<br /><br /> Since I've read so many reviews with PRO and CON layouts that helped me, Im going to try that<br /><br /> PROS:<br /> -Nice large, bright LCD screen<br /> -3 optical and 10 combined zoom<br /> -MANY scene settings<br /> -Fun photo effects<br /> -Quality video<br /> -Sleek design<br /> -Good Flash<br /> -Great Photo Quality<br /> -Good Macro, close-ups<br /> -Simple controls and software<br /><br /> CONS:<br /> -With batteries its heavy<br /> -Occasionally a blurred photo (Rarley)<br /> -Average battery life<br /><br /> Overall, i would definetly recommend this camera. Canon will never let you down! I wasn't expecting to buy this camera, actually it was mostly an impulse -spur of the moment- kind of thing, but i couldn't be happier with what I got!<br /><br /> If there were decimals in the ratings, this camera would receive a 4.7 from me, the .3 points dropped because of its weight and average battery life.","Don't be fooled by the \"Point-and-Shoot\" classification given to this camera. The camera is very easy to use for those who are new or not-so-new users, yet it offers the flexibility to let seasoned users and enthusiasts take control and unleash the power of this artifact. With 13 shoot-modes, fully manual controls (or fully automatic, if you so choose), and a variety of powerful firmware software (inside the camera) makes this camera a very solid runner-up.<br />The manuals are great and very explicative and instructive (which most manuals lack). The layout of the camera has a functional no-nonsense approach, which makes it accessible for those of us who have adult-sized fingers. The LCD is very good and its brightness and sharpness is definitely a plus. The \"feel\" of the camera is absolutely great. In spite that it's a bit on the heavy side (as compared to other digital cameras), the camera design allows for a very comfortable and secure grip.<br />The battery life is great with rechargeable batteries, the internal buffer of the camera makes for easy continuous shooting a breeze. The \"creative\" settings are very good and it makes life easier when the one is trying to accomplish a task to which one needs some priority (Aperture, Shutter Speed, Exposure, etc.). The picture quality and compression are superb.<br />This is my 5th digital camera and I'm convinced this is among the best, if not the best, of all the cameras I've owned and used. At this price range ($200-250) it's practically a gift.","Bought this a few months ago since the A80 is now the in cannon camera, so the price point on the A75 has dropped. It seems that you can get a 3.2MP at a good price these days if you shop around. I have been happy with my A75. I dont think you get a better bang for your buck unless you move up to the SLR digital camers with their shorter shutter speed. But for the $200-$300 range this is a great buy.","I've been holding out on buying a digital camera for quite a while. One thing I did know while doing research was that I wanted a Canon. I decided that I wanted a digital SLR for my artsy \"pro\" shots and a point-and-shoot for \"everyday\" use. For the SLR my decision was easy, a 10D (or whatever its successor is, I haven't purchased it yet). Deciding on a point-and-shoot was a bit more challenging. I didn't want to buy a point-and-shoot that was too high-end as I would soon be investing in an expensive SLR set-up. I was considering the higher-end G5 or the S1 IS. Honestly, the A75 wasn't even on my radar. Then one day the decision was made for me. I learned of an awesome deal for the A75 and it required that I act fast. I picked one up and immediately dove right into the user manual to learn all the capabilities that this digicam had in store for me. I was instantly impressed by all the features they crammed into this little 3.2 MP wonder, like the 13 shooting modes, which are much like presets for certain subject/scene situations. It has a large clear 1.8\" LCD to frame and preview your shots. The 9-point AI Auto Focus will ensure that your pictures are clear and sharp. I especially liked the fact that this camera could also be used in a fully manual mode. I enjoy tinkering with settings to get the optimal shot of a subject or scene. I'm one of those who don't mind setting a custom white balance (BTW, there are presets for that too!). Overall, I am VERY pleased with this product and would definitely recommend this camera for users new to digital photography or the seasoned veteran looking for a good point-and-shoot for those family gatherings.<br />If you plan on purchasing the A75 I highly recommend getting rechargeable NiMH batteries. I own the Rayovac PS6 15 minute charger for use with their I-C3 15 minute rechargeable AA batteries. The ability to charge these batteries in 15 minutes has proven to be an indispensable feature for me.<br />I would also recommend purchasing an extra compact flash card with a minimum of 128 MB.","I bought this camera after returning my other one... I really the zoom (3x) and the quality of the pictures. Although it took me 2 days to learn ALL the buttons I figured it out by reading the manual. The movie mode- with sound- works well. I was able to by RECHARGABLE batteries which will last long. The Memeory card that it comes with is also a plus. Its larger than the other camera I had and returned,  mine help 15 pictures and 1.05 minutes of video. NICE! I also like the size- not to big not to small.","I wanted only canon after owning Panasonic, Sony & Fuji Cameras, Canon Simply does it great ! Menus are awesome & software is even better.<br />A lot of people didn't note this ! Canon has great video quality, with A75 you can zoom before starting to record the video.  It beats my $1000 DV Camcorder !!!!!!!!!!!<br />Canon Pic quality requires no further explanation.  Esp with Canon i960 printer, it is fantastic !!!!!!!!!!!!<br />1. I picked A75 over A 70 becos of bigger LCD, 9-point AF, nice very useful pre-set pic modes like indoor, beach, foliage etc.<br />2. I picked A75 over A80 becos of better video mode (640), less heavy, brighter/bigger LCD screen, cheaper.<br />3. I picked A75 over S1 IS becos of AF Assist Lamp & less purple fringing.<br />4. A75 uses AA batteries as opposed to S50/S60.  Also, S50/60 doesn't support lens attachments easily. A75 costs half of S50/60 & produces equally good pics.<br />5. My next replacement will be New model that replaces S1 IS with 5MP, AF Assist-lamp & cheaper Memory card of 2-4GB capacity, for now i am very happy with A75.","I've had a Kodak DX3400 for about 3 years now, and it came time to upgrade...I wanted a compact point and shoot that had some extra options to take creative photos.  As a hobbyist photographer, I managed to get some fantastic photos out of my old Kodak, but it took horrible photos in low light and took poor action shots.  After much research and comparison at some fantasic review sites, I decided on the PowerShot A75.  I am NOT disappointed.<br />The Canon Powershot A75 is everything I wanted in a point and shoot.  It's small (but comfortable in your hands), has plenty of resolution for point and shoot abilities (great prints up to 8x10) and has enough manual options to take nearly every type of shot.  I did some serious experimentation, and found that even in very low light situations, the camera can either capture what it really looks like, or, by using the shutter priority, you can get vibrant, full color shots that look like they were captured in bright daylight. (I photographed my entryway at 9:45 PM, with dusk filtering in through windows 18 feet away, and got a vibrant, perfectly exposed photo...amazing)<br />The auto mode is good, but should really only be used by inexperienced users...the best shots come from taking advantage of the Scene modes (the indoor scene setting takes PERFECT indoor shots, with perfect exposure, white balance, and color saturation).  The portrait mode opens the aperture way up to capture the subject in crisp detail while blurring the background, and it goes on and on.  In addition to the Scene modes, there's also a 'fast shutter' and 'slow shutter' mode which are fantastic for taking action shots or blurring moving water, respectively, without having to worry about setting the shutter speed and aperture.<br />There's also a movie mode and a PhotoStitch mode.  The movies are good quality for a still camera, though nowhere near the quality of a digital camcorder.  The PhotoStich mode assists you in taking panoramic photos, by showing your last photo and letting you line up the next shot with the first one, so the included PhotoStitch software can automatically merge them on the computer.  The panoramas work quite well, and preserve the exposure of the first shot, which limits color variation.  The photo stitch software took about 10 seconds to stitch 9 photos together and create the single panorama.<br />The manual controls are fantastic.  Custom white balance for oddly lit areas is extremely easy to use (though the preset white balances and the auto do quite well).  Manual focus is outstanding, and can be used in conjunction with any other mode, except full auto.  I used it to take great clear photos of my darkened treeline in the moonlight, and got a crisp, beautiful photo.  Full manual is tricky if you aren't used to adjusting shutter speed and aperture together, but it will let you know if the camera settings will over or under expose the image (though you can still take the shot).<br />At the slower shutter speeds, you do need to be steady, so a tripod or setting the camera down helps enormously for night or time exposure shots, but that's the case with any camera.  To aid in steadying the camera for these long exposures, the camera has a 2 second self timer in addition to the standard 10 second...so you can take photos without having the jitter from pressing the shutter.  That said, in good lighting, the camera is fine to treat like any other point and shoot, and with a fast shutter, you can get crisp images with the camera bouncing all over the place.  Shots taken while riding in a car are very crisp and clear while using the 'fast shutter' mode.<br />Overall, I am extremely impressed.  For the price, this camera is just outstanding.  In my opinion, you don't need more than 3MP for a point and shoot, so this is a great buy.  One thing that I would do, though, is buy a mini tripod to put in your pocket so you can get great photos at night.  A larger memory card would be nice too, but I already had a 128MB from my old camera, so I didn't need to worry about it.  I'd say this is the best point and shoot for the money.","Best $ I've spent on a Digi-Camera. Outdoor pics are incredible, colors are 98% as accurate as my expensive 35mm lens Cameras. Motion pics are not blurry, still pics are crisp, indoor pics tent to be a little dark for subjects around the focused item but much better than other digitals out there. The zoom and activation responce times are fast, ease of use is great. Digital 10x zoom is crisp and comes out as good as 3x Optical when on print. Upload times are fast, software which comes with it is easy to use. 4AA Batteries last about 200+ shots on the 1200 x 1600 high res mode (4x6 print mode), including playback view time and all the zooming in/out time. Overall I am very happy with this Camera!","This is my first digital camera.  I researched for months on cameras and decided that I didnt really need to spend $500 on a 5MP camera to get the quality shots I was looking for.  My only quirk with this camera was the 1st one I bought had a problem within 30 minutes of buying it, it got an E18 error message which the shutter had a problem.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I took it back to Target and the replaced it, no questions asked.  Since the defective camera went back the new one has been supurb.  I have enjoyed every photo I have taken. I would recommend this camera to anyone that doesnt want to spend the big money on a camera they dont need.","This is my first digital camera.

Even if your hand is moving a little tad, the picture wont be perfectly clear. It can be hard to take a perfect picture. But...if you fool around with the settings, the pictures come out nearly perfectly most of the time, with complete gems thrown in every now and then..","My mother wanted something more compact (and \"cute\") so I sprung for a S410 for her.  For my step-dad, who has Parkinson's, the A75 has turned out to be PERFECT.<br />The human engineering on small cameras is a feature people often overlook.  I own a large Sony digicam, but I can't handle any of their compacts or their V1 without having to concentrate on where my large-ish fingers are resting.  Another thing people sometimes fail to consider is how SECURE the camera is in your hands.  A child could grab the S410 from my hands, but no one on Earth could get the A75 loose.  My parents are in France with their cameras now and I'm sure that no jarring in a museum or crowded street will dislodge the A75 from my step-dad's weak hands.<br />One reason for the nice grip is because that's where the four AA batteries go.  For some people (me included), this seemed like a weakness of the camera versus the custome Li-ion batteries of the competition.  However, once you spring about $25 for four 1850 mAH (or stonger) rechargable batteries, you will find yourself getting double or more the bttery life of a S410 (which with it's 850 mAH battery does surprisingly well).  The well-respected dpreview website has tested the A75's predecessor (the A70) in comparison with a slew of other small-format digicams and found it to have the best battery life by a wide margin.  WARNING:  the AAs that come with the camera only lasted one day of intermittent \"training\" use...so don't be disappointed.<br />The A75 takes great pictures.  We set up a scene with lots of detail to compare all possible size and resolution settings (\"L\", \"M1\" which is 1600x1200, \"M2\" which is 1024x780, and \"S\" which is 640x480 (for e-mails)) and took a shot at each of those sizes with the three resolution settings (\"Superfine\", \"Fine\", and \"Normal\").  We printed them at 6\"x4\" at a local Kodak digital picture kiosk (recently deemed better and cheaper than Fuji's by a consumer group...Consumer Reports IIRC) and compared them with a magnifying glass.  There were no easily discernable differences in quality until we got to the M1/Normal setting.  Even then it was just a tiny difference in some detail in the pine needles of a distant tree.  In other words, if you're starved for storage card space, don't panic -- you should be able to get fantastic prints with this camera even with the lower settings.  (Another indication that there's rarely a reason to go beyong 3.2-4.0 megapixels in a pocket cam -- don't waste your money on ANY compact 5.0 cam, Canon or otherwise (ex. S500 -- forget it!).<br />The A75 uses the ubiquitous Compact Flash Type I cards.  That's not as important as it used to be (all cards, SD included, are rapidly getting cheaper).  However, you can get these anywhere for cheap in a pinch, and Amazon has GREAT deals on CF cards.  I got each of my parents a SanDisk 512 card for ~80 each -- that was six weeks ago and they've dropped since.  My step-dad's A75 on max size/max-resolution (\"L\"/\"Superfine\") will take just over 300 pictures on that card!  (My mom's S410 will handle a bit less -- 280 IIRC).<br />The picture quality on auto is great, the \"panorama\" feature is addicting as heck (I'm looking forward to their France panoramas -- a feature offered on the A75 and the S410).<br />The included software is fine -- nothing special, but all you need, and it worked on my parent's old PIII running Microsoft Windows 98 (not even \"SE\"!).  If you have a newer computer, you will have a hard time beating the Adobe Elements/Album combo that Amazon offers -- well-worth it!<br />We originally considered paying list price at Be$t Buy in order to get an extended warranty, but we realized that if they go bad in France it won't help, so Amazon saved me a bundle.  THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE AFAIC TO BUY DIGI-CAMS AT THIS LEVEL THAN AMAZON.  MEMORY CARDS, TOO.<br />Me, I'm waiting to see how Sony's new W1 looks (I like the huge movie resoultion it offers, perhaps Canon's only weak area compared to the compettion).  If the Sony doesn't do anything for me, then I'll probably go with an A75 for myself -- the S410 is an awesome little cam, but it's a bit uncomfortable in my hands and the screen is only 1.5\" which is another weakness compared to the competition.  If they had a 1.8\" LCD on the S410 I'd go with it so I could have a great (but not as versatile) cam I could keep in my pocket -- heavy though it is.<br />I hope this helped.  The world of digicams is tough, and changing fast.  With that said, I don't think you can go wrong with the A75.  The S410 is also great (weaknesses noted) but you can get something similar from the competion for $100 less (alhtough you'll sacrifice a bit in picture quality).<br />Good luck!  (And search Amazon on weekends for CF deals -- go with a 512!!)","This is my third digital camera and I just love it. It is easy to use, the LCD monitor is crystal clear and the pictures are just beautiful when printed.(I use an online photo processor.) The software is really easy to use.  I highly recommend the A75.","Awesome Camera!!!  I had researched for weeks trying to figure out which camera to go with and each one had little \"problems\" or \"quarks\" with them so I finally decided to go talk to a salesman and actually see the cameras.  Found a great salesman (non-commission) who first asked me what I was going to take pictures of mostly and then took the time to explain the different cameras and features.  I went with the Canon A75 (which was not on my list when I walked into the store) and I have had it for about a month now.  We have a 10-month old son and we just got back from vacation and I just have to say this camera is AWESOME!!!  I did purchase the 256 mb card and the Canon Powershot Package (with battery charger, set of rechargeable batteries and case).  Highly recommend these items.  For ease of transfer to computer, I bought a card reader (like $16) and it is so simple.  You just pop the card out of the camera, into the reader and your \"album\" opens up.  Download and erase all in one shot and ready to go again.  Battery life is great; having the digital video with sound is also a very nice feature and I had a couple of prints done at the local store and crystal clear pictures.  Looks even better than my old point and shoot 35mm.  Guess I am heading next to e-bay to try to sell those.  No more film developing and \"wasted\" pictures for me!  Happy shooting!!","I've wanted a digital camera for years, but being of the older generation I am somewhat put off by technical gadgets. Besides, my 22-year-old 35mm Canon Program AE seemed sufficient for me. After a lot of online and instore research, I finally broke down and bought the Canon Powershot A75. Suffice it to say, it's a breeze to use and the picture quality is out of this world. Great product for the money.","This is our first digital camera and we are taking pictures like crazy!  It is so easy to take photos (without even figuring out what all of the little icons mean) and download to your computer.  The software makes it easy to put photos on your computer or dvd and the printed picture quality is great!","Just got this camera couple of days ago and I am very impressed. Comfortable grip, controls and picture quality looks great. It's a good idea to buy an additional (larger capacity) compact flash memory card since the stock 32meg doesn't hold that many hi-res photos. If you only want shots for email / web, the 32meg will probably suit you fine, but if you want good quality prints, you'll need more storage. Pet peave is lack of case and accessories in one bundle with camera. I had to fork over additional $45 for a soft case and charger(inc 4 AA batteries). The charger says to use Canon AA's only - not sure why. Overall great little camera - just could use better product bundle (charger, case, extra flash card).","A camera worth a thousand words.  In the past, i have owned two digital cameras; a Fuji 2600 and a Kodak DX4330.  The Canon A75 has far surpasses both of these cameras COMBINED.  The camera is very easy to use, and the image quality is GREAT.  It comes with a 32mb card which can hold 50+ pictures at the highest quality, and over 300 pictures in the absolute lowest.  Then there are several size and quality intervals giving varing numbers of pictures.  Not only are the pictures great but the batteries last FOREVER!!  I purchases a set of Monster Power cells (NIMH batteries 2100mah), and put them in my camera.  I then took my camera with me on a trip to new york, and they lasted from 5 AM  all the way to 11:30 at night with the LCD and Redeye Flash on for every picture.  Even at 11:30 when i got home again, the camera was still going strong.  The best part is, that i NEVER had to change the batteries once the entire time.  I got over 125 pictures, plus the added minutes of scrolling through the pictures.  At first, i was sceptical that a camera with a 1.8\" LCD and powerful flash could last this long but I took a chance, based on Canon's reputation.  And a great payoff it was.  The Canon A75 is a terrific camera, and I would recomend it to anyone who is in the market for a digital camera.","So far, so good. Ive heard tons of complaints about the A70 (E18 Error), but im hoping the updated version got rid of most of the problems. I havent developed any pics yet, but i will very soon. Seems like a good idea to extend your warranty with the company that you buy it from, because the horror stories about Canon's support service are many.<br />But yeah...ive taken some pics, used the video mode, played around with the features. Everything has been working just fine. The pictures that show up in the LCD display are pretty great. I hope this translates well into a developed product.<br />Anyways...i just wanted a point and shoot camera that had extra features in case i decided to get creative. If youre looking for something more, look elsewhere. If youre like me, just trying to find your way through this new digital world --- go with this camera. It fits into the hand perfectly, it's fairly simple and easy to use...and seems, so far, to take great pics.","My wife and I looked at many cameras before deciding on the Canon A75.  It's got the perfect blend of quality images, not too many features or un-needed features for that matter.  This camera was very easy to take out of the box and get snapping away.  The size and weight of it seem perfect as well.  A very good camera at a reasonable price for digital imagery.","ok...this ISN'T my first digital camera...In fact I have five counting this one. I can say without a doubt this is the best of the lot when it comes to a point-n-shoot digital camera.  In fact, it has tremendous features that make this a great camera for an intermediate photographer.  You have full auto modes as you would expect but you also have full manual modes...even manual focus.  You really have the features necessary to be very creative with this camera.<br />The software that comes with this camera is great.  Has all you'd expect.  The instructions are pretty clear and everything works as described.<br />Resolution isn't 4 or 5 megapixels like some of the competitors but I have those as well and I always shoot with a lower resolution anyway.  3.2MP is plenty for a 8x10 and fact is rarely will you need more than an 8x10 from a point and shoot digital camera.<br />Great camera...I'd highly recommend it."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S410 (Digital IXUS 430)","amazon_reviews":["One cannot go wrong with any Canon PowerShot series camera.

I can't upload photos from the computer to the camera.<br /><br />Two downsides: The body began to discolor after my first visit to the seashore. I'm not sure whether it was the salty air or whether the Coach bag ostensibly designed for it is lined with an inappropriate material, but dark splotches have been spreading over the formerly shiny front. At least the camera looks very old now, so maybe it will be less of a target for theft!<br /><br />Also, there is a delay between depressing the shutter release button and the exposure. This is not a problem for still lifes and posed portraits, but if you are a decisive moment photographer, you'd better keep shopping.","i think the company i delt with was great - the camera was not my taste, but worked fine and they allowed me to exchange it.","I had the error message on my and I checked the canon website and found that they have a recall for it, I sent it in and they fixed it for free. Check the website and call the provided phone number even if you don't see your problem listed, eventually they might do other recalls do to all the complains.","I bought this as a gift to a family member and what can I say.  Easy to take pictures, and they come out looking really good.  This is the second Canon I've purchased and its very reliable.","Without doubt, if Canon did not make the best digital cameras out there, at least it makes the most popular digital cameras. S400 and S410 are the first two which made Cannon so successful in digital camera market. And the later SD series definitely push Canon to be No. 1 digital camera seller in US and world(sorry, Kodark yields to Canon this year and HP is considering to leave this market).<br /><br />So far, I am still happy with my choice made about 3 years ago. I have used this camera almost daily, taking over 12,000 pictures already using this S410. It still is strong, except a few scratch on the body. I am satisfied with the picture quality. Before this one, I used Fuji, Kodark and also used other's Nikon, I would say, S410 still the best to use and gives best quality. If considering for the next digital camera, I would take the even smaller size Canon SD series without question.<br /><br />This camera is NOT perfect, anyway. But please tell me, which one is? And it might not never have one. However, it's good enough for me. Specificly, the cons of S410: startup is not fast, focusing sometimes takes longer time than expected. Not good at contiguous shooting. Also I got the famous E18 error after two years of heavy use. Being lucky enough, I just tap it against the table and problem is gone. Other than that, it is so far so good for me to carry it and use it everyday.","I have never owned a camera in my life (hubby always took all the pics) and this has been perfect for a beginning photographer mom.  It fits in my pocket (guess that's the elph part), and we have taken it on two summer trips so far.  I can't believe the photos are so crisp and colorful, and print up as well as the ones we always had developed at the drugstore.<br /><br />I have to admit that my two young children have helped me with the batteries, memory cards, and understanding how to get the photos off and printed.  But if they can do it, I can certainly learn.  Great camera and I am capturing memories I might have lost otherwise.","I bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends. I have had if for more than one year, and it has performed above expectations under all conditions. The 1 minute video feature is great, and was an unexpected bonus (since I didn't know about it when I bought it off Amazon).<br /><br />The camera works great with iPhoto and MacOS X. I bought a 512 MB card for it and so far it has been great. Both my father and my father in law have the previous Powershot S400 and they have had no problems with it. I figure at some point I'll have to change the battery, because Lithium-Ions lose 20% capacity per year, but so far it has worked flawlessly.","I have this camera for almost 2 years. It has pretty much every intricate and sophisticated features of BIGGER ones...I have a NIKON N80 35mm....I can literally match any image from N80 with my S410. It is very easy to use! can be easily hid anywhere....Excellent camera with some excellent features....can be used anywhere from indoor ocasions, sporting, landscape to under water shooting. You can see for yourself from the sample pictures","I have taken this camera with me on my travels. I have not been gentle with it. I has never failed me. Please see the photos on the Amazon.<br /><br />I have \"upgraded\" to another more expensive camera with mixed results and then returned it.<br /><br />Pros: Uses Compact flash which appears tougher than SD cards, has nice metallic solid feel, battery charge lasts longer than any conceivable picture taking situation, nice sharp lens when using macro and 1x magnification, 4 megapixels is sufficient for elargements of at least 5x7 and it appears to me 8x10, although I do not find the need for it. No bells and whistles but solid workhorse..thousands of pics with no problems. My friends and family own one too and are of the same opinion and do not want to trade up.<br /><br />Cons: Shutter response could be a little faster, if you are using  3X magnification...have a very steady hand, sunny day and a tripod:) or the pictures will be blurry. This is true of most other cameras in that class. I have found that even the cameras with stabilized zoom do not do very well with anything greater than a 3X magnification.<br /><br />I really like this camera. Check my pictures please.","I've owned this Canon s410 for 3 months now, it replaced my s230, which I passed down to my son. I really loved my s230 and was hesitant about buying this one. All I can say is WOW! Don't know why I waited so long.<br /><br />The picture quality from this camera is so much better than the s230. Of course I love the fact that it takes the same batteries and CF that my s230 took, as I have spares of both. The real thrill was how few blurred pictures I take now. LOL I have to be one of the worst photographers (snapshot shooters). When my husband looks at my pics lately, he asks me how come they are so good. This really is unusual for me.<br /><br />The only thing I can attribute it too is the s410. This is a great camera for anyone, even a total camera klutz like me. I love to shoot pics, but nobody wanted to look at them before.<br /><br />I highly recomend this camera, even though it's discontinued. If you can find one, buy it.","We really love this camera and strongly recommend it. Canon keeps its reputation for high quality lenses and advanced technology. The pictures are great both in daylight and in inner areas/night (sometimes you don't even need the flash). The user interface is very simple and easy to use.<br /><br />The only (minor) disadvantage might be that it's a bit heavier than we expected.","I own both this camera (PowerShot Digital Elph S410) and the Canon Digital Rebel (a digital SLR camera with interchangeable lenses).  Of the two cameras the Digital Rebel takes exquisite pictures. Yet, I use the S410 far more often and tend to take far more pictures compared to its expensive cousin (Digital Rebel about $1,000).<br /><br />Why? The small size of the Digital Elph makes it so handy and inconspicuous. I do not think twice about sticking the Digital Elph in my back pocket and pulling it out for a quick shot or two. It's a social thing. There are a lot of social situations where you would rather not have a big honking SLR camera around your neck. You really look like a photographer in those circumstances.<br /><br />As I said, there are times where you just want to blend in with the activity and this camera is great for documenting what you are doing. No one seems to mind when you pull it out. With a larger camera (Digital Rebel) I tend to spend more time fiddling with the settings and people can be a little more self conscience.<br /><br />I love both cameras and the Digital Rebel certainly has its place but the Digital Elph is perfect for taking snapshots. Image quality is very good; low noise and bright, vivid colors. This camera is probably a better choice that the 5 MB S510 as the S410 has less noise at higher ISO speeds.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like with the Elph is that the battery doesn't last too long. It charges quickly with the battery charger, but I should probably invest in a second battery. Also, you should invest in a larger CF card. A 256 MB card will hold a full weekend's worth of pictures and then some.","I bought the Canon S410 because I wanted a longer (3x) optical zoom than the S230 (versus 2x optical zoom) I already owned (and love).  I also wanted a model that still used compact flash cards, like my S230, so that I would not have to begin purchasing yet a different kind of memory.  All my digital cameras use Compact Flash memory and that makes my life simpler.  And I was also attracted because it used the same battery, and hence the same charger as my S230.<br /><br />I debated buying the S500, but decided the S410 had everything I needed...and cost about $100 less.<br /><br />I have been shooting with my S230 since August of 2002 very happily, and still use it with good results.  The S410 seems just as capable, and the longer I use it and familiarize myself with where the settings have been moved to, the more I love it too.<br /><br />So, one month on, and I can say I am a very happy customer.<br /><br />I had read a lot of reviews on these cameras (the S410 and the S500) and many readers mentioned an \"E-18\" error. I then researched this error on the Internet.  I have not experienced this, but I have only owned it a month.  I can only hope that if I am careful with it (it isn't a toy, nor indestructible), that I will have many happy years of use from it.<br /><br />I also shoot with two Nikon digital cameras (both are professional models) and take photography seriously.  Sometimes I am quite amazed at the quality my Canon cameras produce for me.  I believe these should not be underestimated.  I find that the more I use any camera, the better atuned I become to what it can do or cannot do, and also what it can do well!  Everything has its own strengths and weaknesses, not just human beings.","I bought this camera as an upgrade from the S200.  I can keep all my previous accessories and get the higher resolution and zoom features.  It takes pictures faster than the S200 (focus, shutter, and flash seem faster) and still the same size and weight (in fact, I think it's a bit lighter).  Plus, at $250 it's quite a bargain.","I am getting married soon and purchased this camera for when I go on my honeymoon to Hawaii and so far I am very pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />The camera is easy to pick-up and learn to use, with a very quick learning curve.  The pictures it takes are very high quality with no pixilation.  The screen on the back is very clear and a nice size as well.  Point and shoot in every sense.  And the videos you can take with it are pretty good for a digital camera. Others I know have the same camera and they are all pleased with it as well.  If you're looking to get a digital camera for the first time, then this is a good place to start.<br /><br />If you get this camera though, make sure you get at least one spare rechargeable battery.  Like every other digital camera, if you plan on taking a lot of pictures (such as at a wedding) the battery will likely die on you 1/2 way through the day and there is nothing worse than being about the take a picture and the camera just shutting down completely.<br /><br />Also, getting a larger size flash card is highly recomended.  The one it comes with will hold about 50 pictures or so, which is twice as much as most disposable ones, but it's a digital camera and the whole point of getting a digital camera is to be able to take as many pictures as you want without having to worry about film, and most times you're going to take more pictures than the card will hold, especially if you still have pictures left on it from the last time you used it.  I got a 1GB card that I love because it holds well over 900 and now never have to worry about memory.<br /><br />But all in all this camera would be a good purchase for anyone looking to get into the digital camera game.","Canon's definitely got a good little camera with this Elph.  I would strongly suggesty buying a larger capacity memory card as the one that comes with the camera only holds about 35 pictures.","I am extremely happy with my camera and so are my friends.  It's so easy to use and the pictures are amazingly clear.  This camera is worth every penny!","This is great little camera I can take anywhere and still get great snapshots. Much of the time this great little Canon will suffice, and I don't mind carrying/wearing it on my belt when a heavier camera would have been left at home.  Most of the time I do not need the firepower or flexibilty of my G5, Digital Rebel or D10.  I have often regretted not having a camera with me when a great shot or memory came up and I left my big and heavier cameras at home.  Now I have no excuse.  It uses the same CF cards as my other cameras.  The camera is built tough and does not show finger prints.","My experience with the Elph S410 has been a love affair from the very first picture I snapped.  I was used to using a 2.0 megapixel, 8 year old Kodak digital which weighs at least 4-5 times as much as the Elph and is twice as large.  I have always been partial to Canon cameras since I bought my first Canon AE-1 SLR about 20 years ago.  Even so, I shopped extensively before selecting this camera.  It is easy to use and has an adequate zoom for most situations.  There is no comparison between the quality of the photos between this 4.0 megapixel and my old Kodak, but all I can say is that the pictures come out very sharp and the colors are incredibly true.  I fully intend to buy a digital SLR 8.0 or higher MP camera in the future, but this little sweetheart is a great camera in the mean time.  The battery is rechargeable using the charger adapter which comes with the camera.  I also purchased the Accessory kit which includes a carry bag large enough to carry the camera, the manuals, the charger and the spare battery that comes with the kit.  It is even large enough to carry your wallet and other items so you can use it as a \"purse\" if you so desire.<br /><br />The camera comes with a fairly small CompactFlash media card, so I would recommend purchasing a larger one if you don't want to spend your time constantly downloading and deleting pictures.  With a 256MB card I can take a couple hundred pictures without downloading for quite a long time.  You can directly connect the camera to your PC or a direct print printer to do your download with a USB cable or you can use a media reader.  The charge on the battery lasts a very long time.  I have not actually calculated it in hours, but I keep the camera with me most of the time and it usually lasts through 5 or 6 shooting sessions if I don't use the viewing feature (which uses a ton of your battery life!).  Having the extra battery charged up and ready in the case makes it a snap to swap them when needed.  It takes a little over an hour to recharge one of the batteries.  This is so superior to the older digital cameras that I am in heaven!  It took absolutely awesome pictures when we visited the Grand Canyon earlier this year.<br /><br />The Elph has an impressive list of features including the ability to set it to manual if you prefer setting up a photo that way.  I usually keep it on auto, but have used the manual feature a few times and it works great either way.  Both the media card and the battery are very easy to remove and reinsert.<br /><br />It is extremely lightweight and compact and it fits in the palm of your hand.  Although there is smaller media than the CompactFlash used by other cameras, this was a bonus for me as I already owned 2 CompactFlash media cards from my Kodak which work in the Elph.<br /><br />I just cannot get over the quality of this little camera.  Amazon offered it for a very nice price.  If you are looking for a great little versatile camera, check this one out.  I am sure you won't be sorry!","La cámara es excelente y las fotos que toma muy buenas, lo único que no me gustó fue que en el modo de toma de fotos automático, no hay opción en el botón del flash para que este dispare obligatoriamente, lo cual es muy necesario para elementos que estén en contraluz, o como flash de relleno cuando hay muchas sombras............si se quiere hacer esto, hay que pasar al modo manual y hacer ajustes lo que demora mucho la toma de la fotografía........en cámaras de otras marcas, esta opción de flash si está en el modo automático","After about a year of thinking about ordering a camera, I finally took the leap and bought one.  I chose the canon s410 and thus far have been happy with it.  It is easy to use and the pictures look good.  For the price, I am happy with this 4 mp camera.  It has a solid metal body which makes it heavier then other models, but I think will make it better in the long run for durability.  The battery charges pretty quickly and you don't have to charge it completely before using it again...which is nice if you just need enough power to take a few more shots and don't have time to wait for it to charge.  The life of the battery is also pretty good...I used it for a couple weekend trips and took about 60 pictures during the period, reviewed pictures often and even took 3 short film segments and then it finally ran out. It does not give you a long warning for low battery however.  Probably only about a minute or two...the light came on I took a picture and then the camera went dead. It doesn't have a lot of extra features, but for the beginner, point and shoot operator, it seems to have enough.  Overall I am happy with my choice of the canon s410.","The wait was worth all the grief I've taken from my friends.<br /><br />Jumping into the new millenium couldn't have been easier and the results leave me wondering why I waited.  The camera and the pictures(movies) are the best quality, plus the purchasing process was top-of-the-line customer fiendly.","I love this camera; it is easy to use and produces high-quality images.  I will say, though, that I do not require prints larger than four by six inches; I have not tested to see how large of a print it can clearly produce.<br /><br />As a college student, this is a great on-the-go camera, and I take it everywhere with me.  It easily fits into my pocket or purse, and is great for life's random (forgive the cliche) \"Kodak moments.\"","It is really good one. I am using one and bought the same one for my parents. I think they can really enjoy it.","I love the camera and the compact size is great for vacations. I just slip the camera into my purse.  The pictures are very clear. I would recommend this camera to everyone who would like a compact digital camera.","Great battery life. Don't need to worry about additional re-chargeable batteries since the camera comes with its own battery pack and charger.<br /><br />Easy to use features even in manual mode. Red-eye reduction on the camera doesn't seem to work on some people but nothing that the provided software can't fix. Wonderful clarity, not the mention the very portable size.","A great digital, small, light, & good battery life.  Easy to operate, also has move mode. Very clear & bright display.With a 512mb memory takes all the pictures you want.","I LOVE my camera and I couldn't be happier.  It was delivered earlier than I expected and is in perfect condition. I'm extremely happy with my purchase.","I bought this camera for a trip to Hawaii and because it is small and fits well in my purse. Could have more memory and a larger view screen, but for the price, it is an excellent deal!","Great camera for such a little package.  Easy to use and enjoy the ability to view pictures immediately.","This is the most compact incrediable camera you can buy.  It is my second one and I love it.  You can learn how to operate this camera with out using your owners manual, adjust the camera to your personal settings, and carry it in your pocket.  It is great for travel and everyday use.  Don't pass on this camera...it is well priced through amazon.com and a must have!","Very, very happy with this camera.  Easy to use for beginner digital camera user and has many features to grow into when I am ready.  Excellent price.","Positive:<br /><br />+ Good Battery Life<br /><br />+ Wonderful Photo Quality<br /><br />+ 3x Optical Zoom<br /><br />+ Wonderful Video Quality<br /><br />Negative:<br /><br />- No Manual Options<br /><br />- Only 32 MB Memory Card Bundled<br /><br />It's a great camera, unless you don't mind not having manual options.","The S410 may be skim on features and manual options, but the photo quality is excellent.<br /><br />I just LOVE the photo quality of the S410. The S410 is probably the best camera on the market when it comes to photo quality and print-outs. The video quality is very good too, though, the videos can not be shot at or above VGA, and the S410 can only handle low resolution. However, the video quality is crystal clear, and crisp. There is barely any lag at all when taking two pictures, or a multi-shot.<br /><br />The durability is very good. I haven't dropped this yet, but if I happen to, it seems it will take the damage. It has a very strong build, and seems to be made of very strong material. That's quality right there.<br /><br />A negative on the S410 is that there is one or two manual features. That's fine if you just want to take normal pictures, but ones in a complex scene will have a loss in photo quality. Actually, there aren't any big features on the S410 at all. The LCD is normal and is the size of most common digital cameras, and there's no manual settings. Once again, if you just want a basic digital camera, this is it. But, if you want some features, you may want to look around. Photographers may want high resolution videos if they're doing a documentary, or a special project. If you need features, get a camera with features. If not, the S410 is your camera.<br /><br />So, even if the S410 is very skim on features, it's excellent photo quality and durability should make you think about clicking add to cart.<br /><br />Recommended.","What to do when a family member covets your SD400? The answer was to buy them an SD410 and save almost 40%!<br /><br />I have been buying digital cameras from the beginning, starting with some brands that are now extinct and some cameras that offered less than 1 megapixel resolution. My most recent acquisition was a Pentax Optio SV which I panned in a review posted here on Amazon.<br /><br />Anyway, Canon is the benchmark for all other digital cameras. This model offers the usual Canon sturdy build and very good visual appeal. The size and weight are about 50% larger than the SD400, but still not too large for a purse.<br /><br />The LCD screen is excellent; 1.5 inches and readable even in bright sunlight. The optical viewfinder (I just don't like cameras that make you rely upon the LCD only for framing images; sometimes I feel I need to frame an image the old fashioned way) is tiny but very bright and also features all of the menu items you select from setup (or none if you prefer).<br /><br />The 3X optical zoom is smooth and fast and in most cases that's enough zoom power, though I did buy that Optio in search of even more power. For the record, pay no attention to digital zooms. They are computer trickery that enlarges the central part of your image at the expense of image resolution. For example, a 2X digital zoom effect exactly halves your resolution, making such images often unfit for printing. Talking about resolution and printing, the 4 megapixels available on this model allows for high quality 8\" x 10\" prints. The camera is also capable of functioning as a camcorder in a pinch.<br /><br />The controls of the SD410 are simple and intuitive and the menus have evolved nicely, making it much easier than it was with my S200 to navigate and adjust things. That said, the SD410 is part of a class of cameras designed mostly for automatic users; if you crave control, you're probably not shopping for this type of digicam.<br /><br />I find the Canon colors to be about the truest, though performance in that area is degraded when using the flash. Also, \"red eye\" is a problem, though newer software programs like Microsoft's PictureIt! Photo Premium 9 have finally made red eye fixes really easy.<br /><br />The fact that this camera operates on 2 AA batteries is great. You can be environmentally friendly using rechargeables and in a pinch you can just use alkalines available anywhere.<br /><br />Of course the included 32 meg CF memory card is too small to be useful, but that is the case with every single digital camera I've bought. No matter, these cards are the most reasonably priced format available, with prices now below ten cents a meg.<br /><br />Lastly, I want to commend the new Digic II processor in the SD410. It is ready to shoot in about one second after it is powered up, and there is almost no shutter lag at all. Recovery time for a second shot is similarly brief. Shutter lag is a big factor when selecting a digicam and this one jumps that hurdle very nicely.<br /><br />On balance, I'd say the SD410 is a \"best buy\".","super fast delivery and item was as described and works perfect i couldn't be happier thanks","First let me say that this is the first digital camara I have<br /><br />owned.  I am very pleased with the camara.  It is easy to operate and the pictures are great.  I would definately recommend this camara.","This is one of the best point and shoot camera's out there in the market today. You can't get better than Canon S410 for a simple point and shoot 4 MP camera that takes excellent quality pictures. The battery life is pretty good and dont forget to get an additional battery from Ebay. Of course for this price range, you cant expect many manual controls.<br /><br />My advise is:<br /><br /> - Get a second battery<br /><br /> - Get a good compact flash card (Ultra II)<br /><br /> - Use self timer for night shots (preferably on a tripod)<br /><br />and check out the excellent pics taken from this camera at: [...]<br /><br />I have not encountered the E18 and other errors described by other reviewers, so cannot comment on that.","The Canon PowerShot S410 4MP Digital Elph with 3x Optical Zoom it is brand new in box,never opened.I have 6 Canon PowerShot S410 4MP Digital Elph with 3x Optical Zoomat the price of 200$ each.Thanks","This is a wonderful camera, I was amazed at the digital zoom capabilities! Crystal clear photos, this is a super easy camera to use.  Truely point and click, great for the \"technically challenged\" it comes with a battery charger (most brands don't) so you are not wasting $$$ on batteries.  I have yet to run my battery down.  I also purchased the Canon MP760 copier/scanner/printer.  That is a wonderful machine as well. I would recommend purchasing a larger CF card if you want to take video.  This camera is worth every penny!<br /><br />Update May 2, 2007, this camera is fabulous! The battery is still charging up well and I so love this camera, I bought my husband the A540 a few months ago, and this one is much better in my opinion and my husband has asked to switch with me..LOL now the A540 is nice, don't get me wrong, it is just not as compact and works on AA batteries..","First off, I love the Canon digital Elph series. I bought the S100 when it first came out, then the S200, and most recently ordered this one because I wanted to have more megapixels (both the latter cameras still function.) I have to say that I am disappointed though, for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. The screen is tiny and hasn't gotten any bigger over the past 4 years despite gains in screen technology on the market... Clearly Canon has the technology to do it--just look at the SD200 or SD300 both of which have beautiful big screens. The tiny screen on this thing is put in the lower left hand corner of the camera, no ability to pull it out or rotate it which are functions available on other Canons.<br /><br />2. The 'box' hasn't changed in 4 years...it was an impressively small size when it first came out, but at this point, it looks big compared with the SD series or against the Sony series. Guys, it's time to change the look!<br /><br />3. I was quite reluctant to keep a camera that got so many poor reviews...even though the overall review at amazon is more than 4 stars, there are a ton of 1 stars hidden back there, and it's clear that there is a fundamental error in the design of this camera. Check out the other reviews to learn more.<br /><br />In the end, I decided it was worth it to pay more for the same functions in a smaller package, and to buy an SD300. I hope that I won't experience any of the errors described here.","I'm naming this \"The Little Camera That Could\" because it far exceeded my expectations of what a digital camera could pull off. I was a hardcore 35 mm SLR lover until I went on trip with someone who had one of these tiny babies. Suddenly I was envying the gorgeous shots he was getting simply because he had the camera in his pocket while mine was still around my neck the with lens cap on!  A little thicker than a deck of cards, this Canon is palm-sized and very easy to use.  Yep, turn it on, point and shoot.<br /><br />The flash is shockingly powerful for such a tiny camera ... enough to capture the light on dust motes floating in the air. Generally, a flash is only good for about 6 feet. I swear this one shoots to at least 7 or 8 feet. The zoom's pretty good too. Put that together with a serviceable manual mode (for those of you who still want some control over your camera), and you got the ultimate travel camera.<br /><br />A few drawbacks, just to keep honest (but these are not enough to keep me from raving about the camera). Small LCD screen in the back. Comes with a small compact flash card (as all these cameras do) which I recommend you immediately upgrade. Movie mode is limited (but get a movie camera if you really want to get into this mode).<br /><br />Great things about this camera include its optical viewfinder. So many of the newer digital camera are leaving out the eye porthole for design reasons.  Very shortsighted ... if you are in bright sunny conditions, the LCD window is all but useless. Long battery life and excellent refresh. Canon customer service is great as well.<br /><br />You'll be pleased by how many people ask you if the awesome pictures you took were with a digital camera!  Who knows? You may make a few more converts!","I JUST HAD TO WRITE BECAUSE I READ ON SOMEONE'S REVIEW THAT DIGITAL CAMERAS WILL NEVER TAKE THE SAME QUALITY PHOTOS AS SIMILAR PRICED REGULAR CAMERAS. HOGWASH.  I HAVE A CANON ELPH THAT TAKES FILM AND THE CANON S410 DIGITAL AND THE DIGITAL CAMERA TAKES FAR SUPERIOR PRINTED PICS THAN THE FILM VERSION - BETTER CLARITY AND COLOR.  I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT FOR NEW DIGITAL USERS - DIGITAL IS SUPERIOR TO FILM CAMERAS HANDS DOWN.  MY ONLY PROBLEM IS MY LCD SCREEN BROKE - I WAS CARELESS.  BE SURE TO ALWAYS KEEP YOUR CAMERA IN CASE AT ALL TIMES WHEN NOT IN USE.","I like the camera and for the price it is a pretty good option.","I had good luck (so far) fixing the CF Card Error on my Canon Digital Elph.  Here is what I did.  I removed the memory card and battery.  Then I removed every screw I could see on the outside of the camera.  I opened the CF card door and carefully opened up the camera a crack and blew inside. (I did not even remove the case completely.) Then I closed it up and replaced the battery and CF card.  THE CAMERA WORKS NOW!<br /><br />(Note: The tiny screws look alike but they are NOT!  Keep track of each screw and place them on a card with labels or something so you know which screw goes where.)<br /><br />My camera was 3 years old when the CF Card Error appeared all of a sudden, for no apparent reason.  It is an S200 digital elph.  After trying a new card, a new battery and other things that did not work, I contacted Canon. I received the same response as other people: repairs would cost at least $150 OR I could upgrade to a \"refurbished\" S410 for $175 (only six month warranty on this one).<br /><br />So I decided to buy a NEW one rather than buy the refurbished one. Amazon had a great deal on the S410 (came with battery, card, software, cables, etc.) so I ordered it.<br /><br />Then, since my old one was headed for the trash can, I decided to look inside.  I don't why looking and/or blowing inside it fixed it, but it really did!  I am very happy right now.  I hope this works for other people.  Who knows, it might work with other cameras too.  Spead the word if it does.<br /><br />I get stunning photos with my S200 so I canceled my order for the S410.  However, most people would probably like the S410 even better than the out-dated, low megapixel one I have. I will likely upgrade to another Canon Elph in the near future.  For now, I am completely nonplused by the fact that my S200 is working again.","It would be helpful if you included \"What's in the box\" as you do in other cameras. It would be helpful if I knew that  a battery charger, for instance was included with the camera and what ever else is included. Thanks, ----WJH  PS I also notice that the S410 is sold at Staples for $229.50.","I spent months (2) reading reviews and going to stores knowing it was going to be a lot of money for a digital camera and knowing that I would have it for years-so I didn't want to get one that wouldn't fill my needs.<br /><br />My main need was something relatively small. As one reviewer said so insightfully, if you don't have your camera, you can't take pictures and having a camera I can put in my jeans pocket means more fun taking it to parties, dinners, to school (I am a teacher), and everywhere. If I want I just strap in on my belt with a case and extra battery, and off I go.<br /><br />Other than that I wanted to make 5x7 prints that are near photo quality.<br /><br />This camera easily does both these things. So here's the breakdown:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Small<br /><br />Long battery life<br /><br />Video<br /><br />Near photo quality (I can't really tell the difference)<br /><br />good construction<br /><br />Easy to use<br /><br />Easy to charge and quick charging<br /><br />Easy to upload photos onto PC and do simple editing<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Proprietary battery (bought two for long outings<br /><br />Ignore digital zoom, it's worthless<br /><br />Not too inexpensive<br /><br />Comes with too small a memory card (I went up to 512, been great!)<br /><br />In the end this has been a great camera. I CF cards are taken everywhere and are really stable and don't have exposed connections, and the camera is easy to use and carry","This is a great camera for it size.  My only complain is that under low lighting the flash whitens things out. If the Flash is turned off, the picture will be blurry some times.","I have been riding the digital wave since its beginnings with my first casio digital camera that would only print postage stamp sized photos.  Since then I have owned my share of digital cameras and this one fills a niche I didn't think could be filled.<br /><br />I use two cameras on a regular basis, this camera (S410) and a bulkier digital SLR (Canon 20D).  This camera is exactly what it needs to be.  A point and shoot camera that will fit in your pocket.  The pictures it churns out are not of the same caliber of that of the 20D but that is to be expected in the price diffrence ($1500 to $240).  I take this camera everywhere because of its ability to fit in almost any pocket.<br /><br />The camera is easy to learn out of the box but there are a few modifications you might want to make to the settings to optimize the camera for what it is really made for.  First of all never, and I mean never use the full auto mode.  This is because of the lack of options.  Sometimes it is nice to cut down on the options to choose from but this camera is designed not to be a professional camera so it really dosent have many options to change.  In the (semi) manual mode there are new flash options (i.e. night mode) a multiple exposure option for getting more shots in (great for sports when timing needs to be perfect) and even another focus mode (the full auto only allows for portrait mode)<br /><br />With this camera it is all about accessability.  Because of its small size it is really meant to be used as the moment arises.  This makes shot to shot time and start to shot time (from when you turn on the camera to when it takes its first shot) a big concern.  You can decrease the camera's time by turning on the \"quick shot\" option.  This makes the camera focus faster but sacrifices the ability to see the camera focusing on the LCD in real time.  This cuts the focus down more than half in some cases.  This was a real good option put in by Canon.<br /><br />Another option you might want to change is to set the camera to auto ISO in manual mode.  Because of the small size of the camera there is not a dedicated button for changing ISO speed (another nice part about SLRs)  This makses it nessicary to change it through a menu system.  This is not something you want to be doing with a point and shoot.  You really want to \"point and shoot\" not \"mess around with ISO and shoot\"  The camera gets the ISO right almost every time and usually it knows better than you.  Let the camera do this for you.<br /><br />There is a mode on the dial for stiching together pictures (like a landscape) by taking multiple shots.  The camera has you take one shot which it then moves over a little and allows you to line up your next shot.  It allows you to string together shots like this until you run out of memory.  All and all, this is a pretty useless setting and really has no business being on the mode dial<br /><br />A more usefull feature is the movie mode which allows you to take a movie for as long as your card will allow.  These movies are low quality but it is a fun feature for a camera like this.<br /><br />The battery life of the camera is amazing.  I can get more than 500 shots of the highest quality (not using flash) on one single charge.  If you are using a 512 MB card (or less), your card will run out of memory before the camera runs out of batteries.<br /><br />All the buttons are well placed and easy to use after spending an hour or two with the camera.  Those will large hands will find the camera hard to use due to the lack of a good place to put your hand but this is something you sacrifice for such a small size.  One thing I dont like about the design is the difficulty of selecting soemthing (i.ei delete).  The set (okay) button is in an awkward place and so a frequently used button is hard to reach.  If canon put the set button where the \"pict-bridge) button is it would have been a useful improvement (if Canon removed the pict-bridge button it would have been an improvement, most useless feature ever for a camera that has the megapixles to crop images)<br /><br />More on design the optical viewfinder is useless.  It does not cover the full size of the picture, does not show you when the image is in focus and makes you squish your nose when you use it.  I guess it would be useful if you need to save batteries but because the battery life is so good that really isn't a concern unless you are traveling and forgot to bring the charger or a couple spares.<br /><br />As for image quality it is pretty high for a camera of this size.  It isn't near the size of quality of my 20D but for the price, I would give it an 8.  There is a small problem with purple fringing in high contrast areas (i.e. taking a picture of two buildings with some sky in between) but this is pretty usual.  Photoshop (or another image editing software) can usually take this out pretty easily.  Another problem with image quality of this camera is the image degrades a lot when exposed at high ISO settings.  Because of the small size of the chip the sensors are tightly packed together causing a big ISO problem.<br /><br />All together this is a great camera for those who need to take something with them.  It will easily fit into a pocket or purse and is tough enough to resist small drops or your keys (the lens is covered when not in use by an automatic cap).  The LCD could be bigger if you wanted to sacrifice some battery life (which is great) and the buttons could be a little better placed, but the image quality, shallow learning curve, and speed of this camera make up for that (and more).","This is a great camera. One of the best buys for your money if you are looking for semi - professional photos. Very Easy to learn. Great battery life.<br /><br />What I love about this camera the most is that it is ultra compact and yet I dont feel limited in terms of the features. Even has an instant Histogram to let you see if the light / exposure is right.<br /><br />The manual controls are also good to have in area of halogen lighting and dark conditions. You can set the ISO from 50 to 200. Exposures upto 15 secs.. for starry nights !<br /><br />Very Impressed ... great buy at $ 250.","I've now owned two Canon digital cameras.  The first was their 2 megapixel model, and now the PowerShot S410.  I loved the first camera, took 1000's of photos, but eventually the display screen went stopped working.  I decided to replace the 2MP with the 4MP S410 since all of my old accessories match the new model (batteries, CF cards, chargers.)  The S410 is compact, takes great photos, is fun to manipulate with custom manual settings, but is easy to switch back to automatic for point & shoot.  I love using the macro-zoom for up-close shots, and enjoy the night-shot function to make party photos more arty and interesting.  The camera has documented every vacation, party, dozens of sunsets, and bike rides.  I have no quarrel with either camera while they function, but they only seem to last for about a year and a half.  This one now has two problems:  1) it gives a \"Memory Card Error\" and won't re-format the 256MB card, and 2)  It is sporadically responding to the \"power on\" button.  Sometimes it won't turn on.  Is it the batteries?  Is it the camera?  Will I have to buy another one?  I'm getting tired of spending $300+ every 18 months to replace my digital camera.  Check the warranty info before buying, and hold onto your receipts.  Learn the features and take lots of pictures!","I have numerous expensive digital cameras, but I wanted one for the wife that took great pictures, was small, and easy to use.  I could not be happier with the 410.  The only concern I have it that the camera does not have a battery level indicator.  To combat this problem, I simply bought an extra battery.<br /><br />Happy shooting.....<br /><br />R)W","Quite impressive overall. It's SMALL yet I wish it was just a little bit smaller. I have yet to read the manual cover to cover but have enjoyed snapping pictures in the automatic and manual modes so far.<br /><br />The size of the S410 was one of its two biggest selling points. I want a camera I will have with me, not one that's at home taking up space. The other thing I wanted was decent to good image quality, and what I've seen so far makes me think that this camera is a good choice.<br /><br />I ordered a second battery and used an inverter I already owned to charge it in the car. Much cheaper than the Canon car charger. The manuals are (somewhat comically) also very small little books. A useful road-map poster of features is included along with a quick-start guide, which is always square one as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Color reproduction seems very good. Clarity is decent at this point. I obviously need to read the manual to understand everything that's going on, and it's clear that there's a LOT of technology stuffed into this little gem. The controls are well-placed and the menus seem concise, operation overall is quite snappy. I'm pleased. The LCD screen is extraordinarily bright and crisp. Time between shots is acceptable, pretty quick, really, and time-to-first-shot is very good.<br /><br />I don't think you'd need a case for the camera. Wrap it in a handkerchief if you're worried it will get scratched. I like the lens being covered by two little doors that close on power-off. Keeps the lens safe and you don't have a loose lens cap to worry about. The camera is smooth, no protrusions to catch on anything. It's a great looking little thing. It's a little bit heavier than you'd think it would be. I wish it was a little bit lighter and a little bit smaller. Which seems greedy given how light and small it is now!<br /><br />One thing I like in particular is the B&W setting. Shooting in black and white is something a lot of folks who didn't spend time taking Intro to Professional Photo back in college may not have experienced, and it's worth checking out, particularly for portraits. Black and white can tell a better story than color.<br /><br />I'm probably being unfair giving this camera only four stars -- there are certainly no glaring faults, far from it, but this was a realistic choice for me, a camera that I can take everywhere with me, and, no, for this price it's not going to perform like a Canon D20 which is ten times the price, but it is MUCH smaller and twice the resolution of my beloved old Nikon 950 (circa 1999). Maybe I'm expecting D20 performance at a S410 price..?<br /><br />For its size and the price, this camera is quite a good value and is everything I expected, very well put-together and quick. A good choice. Not film-quality images, but very good for what it is. A good balance of resolution, size and weight. A handy, good quality camera to snap photos of the kids with, small enough to have with you everywhere you go. Not that I'd mind the \"inconvenience\" of having a Canon D20 over my shoulder 24/7... but that's simply not in the budget!<br /><br />No regrets at all having chosen the S410!<br /><br />Five years later: I had dropped my S410 and I couldn't use most of the functions, so I shipped it off to Canon to be repaired (for $100, ouch)... and it stopped working after about a month. I was sharply disappointed. I didn't want to send it off AGAIN (another $100), and I was unhappy having no camera. Canon offered a \"loyalty program discount\" or whatever they called it, I could buy a refurbished next-step-up camera from them for about $150, but after the $100 wasted on a not-very-robust repair I was reluctant to do that. I ended up buying a used S410 off a popular auction site. I expect things to last basically forever, so I was disappointed that I was clumsy enough to drop my camera and disappointed again that Canon's repair was extremely short-lived.","just received the S410 in the mail and I love it!...it is sleek, small and easily fits in a tiny purse. It does a good job capturing detail in all kinds of lighting. The 32mb card that comes with it is a waste since it only holds around 20 pics, so order at least a 256MB (holds around 120+ pics) card right off the bat with your new camera as I did.<br /><br />The only downside is that I haven't been able to figure out how to upload the pics to my laptop/pc. I downloaded the software that came with the camera, but somehow, I am still unable to make it work! I will try again and will eventually call customer service if I can't figure it out.","Just bought the S410 2 days ago and took alot of pictures, did not do too much manual reading, only when I was,nt sure of what to do.<br /><br />Most shots were on full automatic and some on manual automatic.<br /><br />Results are beautiful, sharp, great color. camera is built like an MBTA1A, printed some, they were even better than on the lcd<br /><br />I cannot critique a thing on this little beauty, just love it.<br /><br />On most of the smaller digitals, the finder is a joke, too small, this one is a good size, clear and extremely usable.<br /><br />One of the best.","I just received the S410 in the mail and I love it!...it is sleek, small and easily fits in a tiny purse.

All the candid shots of my niece are going to be cherished by the family forever...as I keep them updated every week.<br /><br />I have uploaded all the pics I have taken onto my laptop without any problems. I am using a 256K MB card (Viking) and it does a great job thus far.<br /><br />That's it for now.","It's a camera for those of us who don't know what a darkroom is...This camera makes taking pictures a snap!  It's nice and compact, small enough to fit in my pocket!  It's also feature-heavy, although I must admit I don't know how to use most of them.  The accompanying software is pretty basic - I'd recommend getting Photoshop - you can pretty much do anything you want to a picture with that program.  One recommendation - Get an extra battery!  The low battery indicator does not come on until you have just a few snaps left.  Pay the money - you won't regret it!","I bought this for my wife and we love it. Easy to use, the movie feature is great and the pictures are great for a point and shoot.<br /><br />No complaints, worth every penny.","The Canon PowerShot S410 is a slightly upgraded version of the immensely popular S400 model, which has been discontinued and can be found for close to three-hundred bux. I think since the S410 is only slightly improved -- it is slightly faster than the S400 and sports a new print/share button which I'm not sure you'll be using a lot if you are the typical user -- the S400 is a much better buy.","Got the camera yesterday and i have to say it is great, I took the instruction book to work and read the whole thing. It works great and takes great pictures, Good deal on a very small camera. I ordered a extra battery and card for my cruse in may, Anyone looking for a great camera this is it but just wish it came with a camera bag or holder.","I bought this item based on the good reviews it has received. But I am surprised that it doesnot put date stamp on the pictures. This is the least of the features I would have expected in a DIGITAL camera. A 50$ film camera does that.<br />  Picture quality is good. I am really disappointed that it doesnot put date stamp on the pictures.","The Canon PowerShot S410 is a slightly upgraded version of the immensely popular S400 model, which has been discontinued and can be found for close to three-hundred bux.

Try it, it doesn't hurt anything and it might work. By formating the card it makes something reset in the camera.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />Original message;<br />I have a Canon S400 and after the warranty expired I got a memory error. I did a lot of research on-line and found the following information that it was easy to do and fixed the Memory Error problem.<br />You will need a card reader and a computer (I did it in my laptop)<br />1.Get the CF memory card (CFMC) and place it in the reader.<br />2.On your desktop, Click on \"My Computer\" icon<br />3.Right click on the reader drive<br />4.Click on Format<br />5.Make sure that the file to Format is the \"FAT\" file.<br />6. Proceed with formating.<br />7.Insert formated card back in the camera and try it.<br />I formated the 256mb that I purchased separated and it didn't work. Then I did it with the 32mb. card that came w/ the camera and it did work. Even the 256mb worked after the 32mb did, I am using the 256mb now and it is working fine. Canon will charge you over $150 to fix it and chances are all they do is the card formating. Also, before formating the CFMC remember to download any pictures that you might have in it since formating it will erase it all.<br />Hope this works for you. It is also supposed to work with other Canon cameras that get the Memory Error. ; )","My husband and I did a lot of research looking for a camera that I could throw in my purse/diaper bag and have it handy for everytime my kids would do something that I wanted to remember.  The ease of handling this camera makes it nice for a busy mom of 3 small children.  I was looking for a camera that was compact, sleek, pretty stylish and easy to turn on, point and shoot.  My boys love looking at the pictures right after I take them and the handy screen on the back is a plus for all of us.  When you're taking pictures of three kids you sometimes can't get everyone looking and/or smilling at the same time.  With this camera I don't waste money on developing pictures that aren't up to my standards.  I wind up taking at least 3-4 pictures before I get exactly what I want and then I just go back through the photos and erase what I don't want.  It's so easy to download the pictures to Shutterfly.com and order right from there!  This camera is a must!","This is my first digital camera purchase, and I relied heavily on customer feedback from Amazon and Circuit City.  I bought the Canon S410 from Amazon.  Amazon free shipping exceeded my expectations as usual, even in the busy holiday season.<br /><br />Here are a few pleasant surprises the camera provided:<br /><br />- The lens has a couple levels of protection.  First, it's offset from the camera housing, protecting it in the same way as the human eye.  This was useful when I was doing a closeup of my dog, and he licked the lens housing.  The lens remained perfectly clean.  Second, a shutter automatically protects the lens when the camera is off.<br /><br />- You get a visual \"motion\" warning when you're not holding the camera steady or when your subject is moving too much to keep focus.<br /><br />- You can view magnified shots you've already taken, using the LCD display.  This has given me instant feedback on just how crisp my shots were.<br /><br />The only minor nuissance is likely related to my old Windows98 computer - I need to restart it prior to downloading pictures. Otherwise, all software & features work fine.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with the Camera and with Amazon, and recommend both.","We bought this light weight, easy to use camera for the entire fmaily to use and now we are going to buy another for our college daugther.  The software is especially easy to use and we have used software for many competitive cameras. Canon's software by far is the easiest.  We find 4 megapixels is enough for reasonable quality prints. Good little camera.","I had a hard time researching digital cameras...there's just too much info out there.  I even tried to use the recs from Consumer's Reports, however the things i needed didn't necessarily match what they would rate as high. For example, it was more important for me to have the camera fit in my purse than say for special ergonomic handling.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great camera that gives Better Than Your Friend's Cheap Camera That's Only 2MPX, this is the camera for you lol.  Even the CF card is more than enough for a weekend trip of picture taking.<br /><br />The only downfall is the battery situation...you get all of 10 seconds notice when it's about to die.  It's easy to plug in and recharge the battery, but i would buy an extra one if you travel alot.","i have used the S 400 for less than a year. the photo quality and manual controls are very good. battery charger system good.<br /><br />HOWEVER- for the third time in < 12 mos, the camera HAS FAILED. error message \"E 18\" appears, and you must return the camera to Canon for service. They have handled it n/c twice, and i expect they will again- BUT this lack of reliability is , in my opinion, a fatal flaw.","I reviewed different cameras for a while before deciding on the S410. I've now had the camera for 4 months and I see that I've made the right decision. A lot of the reviews for the other cameras were made within a day or so of getting the camera-- but this is not.  This camera goes everywhere with me and is light enough and small enough to fit in my bag.  It even has survived Hurricanes Charley, Frances AND Jeanne with pictures as proof (literally, outside in the hurricanes)!<br /><br />The only con, as with the other reviews is that theres no battery life indictator but I bought an extra battery so if I go somewhere that I know it'll be use a lot.","I ordered this camera as a replacement/upgrade to my 2.0mp Nikon Coolpix 2500 camera. It is on its way back to Amazon for a refund. The Nikon camera takes much better pictures than this 4mp camera.<br /><br />The color on the canon pictures was fantastic, saturated and beautiful. The sharpness left much to be desired.<br /><br />Maybe my Nikon has spoiled me, but I'll stick with the 2.0mp camera for now and save my money!","After doing tons of research, I ended up going with the Canon S410 and am thrilled!  This camera takes such a great picture- especially for its size.  Now granted, this model is a little outdated in terms of features, but don't let that stop you.  One thing this camera has that makes a load of difference is a focus assist lamp for low-light shots.  Although I've been told this is common, you'd be surprised how few cameras actually have this.<br /><br />Another thing I love about this camera is it's size.  It's really small, but not so small that it's hard to hold or use.. even one handed.  Not only that, but lets say you want to snap a shot of something not right in front of you at night (i.e. - other people at a party while you're talking to someone else), you can palm this thing, hit the flash, and use the focus lamp to aim your shot..  very handy and great for candid shots!<br /><br />Some people might be turned off by the small LCD, however, a smaller LCD is less likely to get damaged if you use this alot after a few drinks or as a road warrior..<br /><br />The only real con I can see is the lack of a battery life indicator.  Not a big enough deal to not buy the camera though.","Power Shot S410 does all that it says it will.  Very Good pictures, servicable video (wouldn't call it good video) with sound, very good battery life, and excellent ergonomics in a compact case.  Well built.  Feels solid.<br /><br />Have had no troubles with anything.<br /><br />Buttons and switches make sense.  Menus are complex but that is because of all the flexibility you have.  Full auto mode works very well and I use it most of the time.  Manual mode allows great tweaking.  Rapid shoot mode works as described.  Video mode is handy though no replacement for a video camera.  Great options on picture storage and compression.  My only improvement need is that I would prefer the digital photos to be brighter than they are.  But I feel that way with almost all digital photos and it may just be my preference.<br /><br />I bought the camera my 5 year old son to use on an father son trip.  I gave it to him at the start of the trip begging him not to drop it.  After a week, he could take pictures zooming in and out, review his pictures, and delete those he didn't like.","If you're looking for an ultra-compact camera at a good price that is very versatile, I'd highly recommend the S410.  I recently purchased one before a long trip to the UK and was impressed with it's many features and how easy it was to get familiar with them.  It's nice to see more manual settings (e.g. ISO, shutter speed) available compared to earlier digital Elph models.  The 3x optical zoom is great, and although the LCD screen isn't as large as with some competing cameras, the ability to zoom in and out in review mode more than makes up for it.  And, the smaller screen size keeps the camera nice and compact and is easier on the battery.  I also like the bundled ZoomBrowser software (it's a nice improvement from earlier versions offered by Canon).  The S410 is fairly priced, and with CF media slowly losing share to SD cards you can get tons of storage at great prices.  And most importantly, I've been very pleased with the picture quality...it takes sharp pictures and rarely requires manual settings for optimal results.  Night/low light performance is particularly impressive.","I spent a lot of time shopping around for digital cameras last summer, and we purchased an S400 - same as the S410 w/out the pictbridge feature.  Have had no regrets about our purchase, and now my entire family has the S410.  The camera has proven to be very reliable in auto mode, and we have used the manual features to shoot in a variety of conditions.  Ease of use is wonderful, and the thing is built like a tank.  Feels nice and weighty in your hand which is nice due to it's small size.  Small size is one of big selling points for us on this camera, and because of this we can take the camera everywhere!<br /><br />The battery life is excellent, but I do recommend another battery or the car charger for when you are on extended road trips or will be shooting for a long time.<br /><br />We have been printing our photos on an Epson R200 - the greatest $100 photo printer out there.  Excellent quality for the price.","I've been a long time fan of Canon products from the original APS Elph to my personal Canon PowerShot S210 Digital Elph. So when our family needed a new camera, getting a Canon was a no-brainer and I'm glad we made that choice. This camera lives up to all the expecations that I have for a Canon. The pictures are generally very crisp and high quality and the zoom provides equally good pictures in the optical mode. The digital zoom never is as good as the optical zoom but still allows you to have adequate picture quality for most purposes. The video recording feature of this camera is never meant to rival a true video camera, but it is great for getting a quick video of something while on vacation, especially if there is sound involved you also want to capture. The microphone will capture a decent mix of area sounds perfect for that special moment, like a clocktower or an impromptu sidewalk concert. Combine all this with some of the best battery performance in the industry. I am always pleased with the fact that I can take about a hundred pictures before requiring a battery change. I would highly reccomend to anybody buying this camera to purchase an extra battery as well so that you always have a spare around. It can come in real handy and is a small investment to keep your camera clicking, especially when compared to other digital cameras that require 2-4 AA batteries for every 50 pictures. Overall, the Canon is one of the best buys in the industry right now and I would highly recommend it to anybody looking for a simple point and shoot camera. It's well worth it.","There are a couple things absolute about this Canon S410 and that is simplicity, cute, and takes nice pictures. Hands down with a couple of adjustments it will take very nice pictures. I recommend the automatic settings. Its very stylish yet not sacrificing intuitive controls. In short, everything is comfortably placed accordingly.  Higly recommend this camera to anyone itching for outstanding pictures.","Hi,<br /><br />I just took this stylish little camera on a three week tour of the UK. It performed very well over the entire trip and provided me with over 800 quality pictures. I really enjoyed the cameras small size (fits in a baggy pocket) and ease of use. Overall, a very good camera.<br /><br />For people looking at buying this camera there are three things that are very important to note before you purchase:<br /><br />1) Because this is such a SMALL camera, the lens is also small. If you are used to a larger digital camera, with a larger lens, this one will NOT take quick, sharp indoor pictures in most cases. Expect to hold the camera VERY steady or place it against a stable object. If you can live with this it provides fair to good indoor pictures (in comparison to other, larger digitals).<br /><br />2) The flash on this camera is very, very strong. Hard to believe considering it's size, but it is. I try to never use the flash, the pictures just turn out too bleached.<br /><br />3) This is my biggest complaint, and the reason I gave it 4 stars. This camera has no battery meter! You only get a warning that the battery is low, and at that point you only have between 4-15 pictures left (depending on LCD and flash settings). This requires you to either have an extra battery or just miss out on important events. This is a huge problem if you are on a trip without an easy place to charge your battery. You'd think canon would have figured a battery meter out by now. I didn't find out this important fact until after I had mine.<br /><br />Hope this helps!","Amazing what can be packaged in such a small case.  This camera takes incredible pictures.  I had a Cannon digital camera before, and I was very happy with it, this one surpasses my expectations.  The movies are very crisp, and look almost as good as if they were filmed with a camcorder.  The only minus for the price it costs is you can't zoom in the movie mode once you start recording.  I have a friend with an Olympis which does zoom in this mode but no sound, and the movies look like they are filmed on an old super8 movie; fun but I'll be keeping my Cannon.  If you want to film in different perspectives just stop filming change the zoom, and shoot some more.  Then make your movie with the easy to use software.  Editing the movies with transitions is actually a lot of fun.  If you set the price aside this camera is a very good value.  You're not going to buy a camera every few months so spend the money, and get what you will really be happy with.","This is my second digital camera, my first was a HP315. You can't take a bad picture with this camera. Great color and exposure. Build quality is outstanding. I compared this to my work camera which is a Nikon 2100 the detail and color is better with the Canon S410. I also ordered the ELPH leather case.","I've had this camera for a week and so far it's been wonderful.  The reason that I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is that there is a lag between pushing down the button and taking the picture, that makes it hard to catch action shots.  Other than that, the pictures are wonderful in all settings and it can be used as a point and shoot camera or much more advanced.  The movies are great!  Definitely buy a large flash card.<br /><br />Hannah McChesney","Amazing camera. Very easy to use in the auto mode for the amatuer photographer and the capabilities are unlimited if you are an enthusiast. Very intuitive menu features. Crisp impages, nice for short videos too. I plugged in a 512 Sandisk CF card and my wife went crazy clicking over 550 pictures in a 10 day trip. Night shots in complete darkness come out phenomenal using some basic speed and light settings (set the flash off and speed at 400ASA.) The camera is versatile and we used it for timer setting on a rough nature trail. With the tough casing did not have to worry about damaging the camera when setting it on the ground of dirt, just enough to keep the camera steady.<br /><br />Only downside was that it does not have a good cover. Taking it in and out of the pocket the mode switches to video and gotta be careful particularly if u hand the camera to someone to take a snap of you.<br /><br />Overall very pleased and highly recommend it.","This camera fixed many of the flaws of the S200 and S230. There is now 3 min movie recording with built in speaker so that you can hear your video on the camera, an optical zoom improvement (2x to 3x makes a pretty big difference) and a battery life improvement. My old S200 used to drain the battery in half a day but with this one, I am finding that I can often go 2 or 3 days without recharging! There are only two things that I wish I could change on this camera: One draw back is that this camera isn't too good at taking fast action shots. There is some shutter lag that is often frustrating. The second is that even though it is in the super compact category, it is still a little bulky to put in my pocket (I'm looking at the Sony Cybershot DSC-T1 but I hear the picture quality isn't too great), but I mean, getting smaller than this may be asking too much. Overall for regular shots of non-moving targets and even slow moving targets, the pictures are crisp, clear, and colorful (especially with the \"vivid\" mode), and I reccomend it.","I bought this camera to replace my Powershot S30, which is old and tired now.  Love Canon quality and features, and had lots of CF cards, so wanted to stay with Canon.  I like this camera's small size and found it very intuitive to use.  I enjoyed the movie mode.  I had to call Canon to find out how to set the high-speed continuous mode, and that's where the trouble lies.  When using the high-speed continuous mode, it only takes pictures quickly in bright conditions.  While in my office, I took several quick shots under the flourescent lighting in a couple of seconds.  Great!  At home, it would take a picture every 4 to 6 seconds.  Not enough to capture expressions of my 1 year old son.  I got so frustrated at missing shots because of shutter lag that I had to return the camera.  Talked to Canon twice more and was told that this is a disadvantage with their Elph and A-series line, something about the lens and small aperture.  The only cure, according to them, is to move up to another Powershot S-series.  So, I have a Powershot S60 on order.  Love Canon, would have loved to give this camera a complete thumbs up, but it just couldn't hold up to what I needed.","This camera is insane.  Takes beautiful crisp pictures.  The auto mode will usually give you everything you could want.  But if you're a camera person, the manual mode gives you plenty of ways to alter the photos.  I immediatly got acquainted with the photo stitch program that comes with it and used it along with the camer'a panoramic mode to make some sweet surround photos.  The movie mode is pretty good.  It won't replace your camcorder, but it's great for making little movies for your computer.  I don't mind not having VGA sized videos.  They're usually way to large and I prefer having movies that are better sized for transferring.  One hand operation is easy with the shutter/zoom combo.  The AI auto focus works really well is quite impressive to watch.  I enjoyed playing with the custom sounds/pictures.  You can set your own background picture and record/upload you own camera sounds for startup, shutter, etc.  The flash is really bright and works almost too well.  The only downfall I have found is that to get the clarity that the camera can provide, you need to keep the camera very still between the focus and shutter, which isn't too long.  If I really want a crisp picture, I use a tiny little tripod to get rid of my arm motion.  It takes decent actions shot, but it's no SLR.  All in all, unless you're a professional photographer, this camera is just what you want.  I bought two 256 mb sandisk ultra cards and that was plenty.  My parents used it yesterday just during the day.  They liked it so much, they put in an order for their own.","In my oppinion you could spend the next few weeks, maybe even months looking for a better pocket-size digi cam, and you won't find one. I've owned this camera for a little over a month now, and I took it on 2 vacations with me so far. I've taken some great pictures with it, but like every camera it has it's flaws...and not all came out great.<br /><br />  Generally, however, I found that if you read the instruction manual carefully, with the camera in your hand, and practice with different settings, when time comes to imortalize a moment, you won't be disappointed. I fiddled with it for a while before I took it for a spin, and I figured out what works best for each type of situation. Unfortunatly, this camera doesn't offere memeory buttons that allow you to load pre-set settings at the touch of one button, but it usually won't take you more then 5-10 seconds to get everything right if you need to.<br /><br />  I've read people say that the menu is not very intuitive...but I've found it to be quite the opposite. People also said that there aren't a great deal of manual functions available... well this is my first camera, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I've been very satisfied with what the manual shooting mode offers in terms of addujusting the exposure, shutter opener timer, shutter speed, lighting environment, etc. Again, by playing with all these settings I've taken great pictures in poor/no light, indoors/outdoors, portraits and panoramics.<br /><br />  I particulary like the fact that you can shoot short 3-minute clips w/ sound, I really like the stiching feature, and the fact that it allows you to record 60 sec voice memos for the pictures you take. I didn't hear anyone mention the software, which I think is an importan part of the package. My experience with it has been a very good one so far. I found it to be very easy to use, especailly for first timers, but it also allows you to get into more detailed settings once you know what you are doing.<br /><br />  My biggest dislike about this camera is that it doesn't have a battery indicator. You never know how close you are to a dead battery untill it happens, at which point it will flash you a red battery icon on the display and 15 seconds later the darn thing will turn off and you can't do anything about it. Now the battery will last you pretty long (190 shots they say). If you play with the settings, view pictures and what not, it is really much less then that. But honestly when will you ever take 100+ pictures w/o being able to recharge the battery.<br /><br />  I would also recommend that when you buy the camera you also buy a CF card with no less then 256 MB available. I like to take my pictures in the finest setting at the second highest resolution. This will give you about 230 pictures without sacrificing picture quality whatsoever. If you go to the highest resolution you will get about 115 pictures.<br /><br />  Having said all that, I think this is a great camera if you are looking for portability w/o sacrificing the most basic functions and still get some great shots. If you want more functions, more performance then you're gonna have to sacrifice size, and you shouldn't buy this camera","If you don't mind using flash for indoor pictures, this is an effective and convenient snap-shot camera. I bought it mainly for my wife to use to record her family, parties, flowers outside, that sort of thing and she's quite pleased with it. It's hard to do selective focus or anything creative with this camera. I'm looking for a decent digital slr for myself.<br /><br />But back to the Canon. Flash flattens everything out, especially a tiny unit locate close to the lens such as with this camera. But if you turn off the flash you'll need a tripod to hold it steady, and even then it's very difficult to specify what part of the picture you want in sharp focus. Other than that, it's a pretty good Instamatic replacement. The initial investment is a bit high, but it's inexpensive to operate for the long hall. You can view the pictures on the computer screen and only print out and keep the real winners.","It's very small, and takes very good pictures.  You'll need a little time to figure out how to operate the many modes, but after that it's easy to use.  It will take 3 minute movies, and they don't take up that much space, either.  It comes with good software that will manage your pics, including a program to splice together images to get panormic pics.  The battery life is great, and it recharges in about 30 minutes.  I can't think of a single problem with this camera.","The fully auto mode of this camera is the closest to making digital photography a totally idiot-proof experience.  While I am personally not at all technologically challenged, I have several other users and potential users of this camera who will appreciate the idiot-proof modes.<br /><br />I like the fact that this camera uses Compact Flash (CF) memory which is not only cheaper that SD and xD memory formats but also appears more rugged.  But for me CF was a big plus since I had a number of old CF memory cards left over from my a previous digital camera that I was able to reuse.<br /><br />The only con I really see is that the battery is proprietary and expensive and also cannot be charged in-camera.  If you buy this camera do consider purchasing an additinal battery to keep handy.  This camera does not have a battery meter so the battery could go quite suddenly.  Having a spare battery would be very helpful in such cases.<br /><br />I found the basic mode (1024x768, Normal Resolution) to be good for most type of pictures.  I purchased an after market 512 MB memory card from Costco for $79 and using the basic mode the camera reports that I can shoot 2714 photographs.  Naturally this is a ridiculously large number of pictures to take even on the most exotic vacation.  But I am comforted by the fact that I can now let my kids take pictures with wild abandon not having to worry about deleting pictures.  In fact this is the only memory card that I will need for my upcoming holiday.","I got this camera because I was looking for a camera that was small but had great resolution. This camera can fit right into the palm of your hand. The only thing i didn't like was that the video is 320x240 pixels but the camera takes outstanding photos.  This is a camera for someone who wants a small camera but with great resolution.","If you just need a digital camera to take pictures in the sun light, you can almost pick any digital camera.<br />But if you want your camera to take great pictures under all different light conditions (i.e. in door, with dark background, wedding photos and other complex light situations), then Canon S410/S500 will be the only choice. Thanks to Canon DIGIC Image Processor and iSAPS Technology, this Canon S410 really takes perfect pictures in all different light conditions, which no compact digital camera from other vender can match.<br />However the Canon case for S500/S410 is very dispointing, which is poorly made with cheap fake leather.[...]","The S410 is built like a little tank and feels much more robust than the Nikon digital I have owned. I have yet to drop it, but it seems like it can withstand impact. The camera reminds me of my old 35mm in that it is basically point and shoot, unlike my Nikon that required scene selections via a scroll wheel selector to get a decent shot. The fast shot option allows you to quickly take second and third shots when needed. The 3x zoom is pretty standard, but does feel quite limiting. Other cameras offfer trade-offs between options and zoom. It may make sense to consider this before making a purchase decision. While the memory card is pathetically low capacity, all of the manufacturers do this; I guess to reduce cost? The camera's sound effects are selectable and add some value.","First lets talk about cons:<br />  1) Auto mode light distribution on the pictures was not as good as in Manual mode.<br />  2) It is heavier than other ultra compact cameras in the market.<br />  3) Battery gets heated up after some time (maybe other cameras has the same problem).<br />  4) No preset modes like night portrait, sunset etc are available in this camera (only portrait and landscape modes are available).<br />  5) Has only a 1.5'' LCD<br /><br />Pros:<br />  1) Take very good quality pictures<br />  2) Has a very helpful picture details like Histogram( display the light distribution in the captured image), ISO Setting and other details in the playback mode that could help you to improve your picture taking skills.<br />  3) Eventhough the LCD is small it is bright and display qulity is good<br />  4) Has a good Manual mode with White balancing, ISO and Exposure settings(if you are a person who likes to take pictures in manual mode rather than in auto)<br />  5) Can do Panorama assist for 26 pictures.<br />Overall, this is a very good camera that takes very good pictures.<br />If picture quality is the most important thing for you in your camera then this is THE camera.<br />If you like to have many cool preset modes and depend very much on auto functionality then you may need to research other cameras.<br />Hope this was useful.","After reading all of the contradictions between customer reviews, reading countless online publications, and going to electronic stores I ended up buying the Canon S410. Sure people will complain about small things, but I find people complain about almost anything.<br />The bottom line is when you are trying to get the best quality shots off quickly this is the camera. It's ability to calculate exposures and make rich, beautiful picures is just amazing. You can shoot in to the sun with this camera while standing in shade and still get beautifully exposed shots. I was worried that the camera was completely automatic. It actually is not. You can control exposure quite well (even take night photographs), use manual focus, and use as b/w. If you are an amateur photographer looking for something fun and light I highly recommend.","I have been using Canon Powershot for around 3 years now and I think I am in pretty good position to dissect it's features, pros and cons.<br />I started out with Canon Powershot S100 and now upgraded to this one. And it's been pleasure all the way. Let me explain why.<br />1. It's incredibly rugged and the aluminium-steel body is way classy then most plastic-bodied cameras out there.<br />2. The picture quality is awesome and I can rival Webshots in photography with this tiny little camera. I am a lot satisfied with the quality of photographs I have been taking all these years. Shots at night are perfectly focussed, thanks to focus-assist light that turns on when you press the shutter halfway down.<br />3. The movie mode has been upgraded over earlier versions and this one lets you shoot clips of upto 3 minutes, with sound. The number of movie clips you can shoot is only limited by your card size. The sound quality is not great, but okay for amateur shooting.<br />4. Ease of use is not really a very important criteria coz I believe no one using a digicam is that dumb. But I believe this one is really easy to use.<br />5. The battery charger doesn't have dangling wires and the prongs are collapsible. Not a great thing, but pleasant.<br />Cons: (What canon could have done to make it better)<br />1. Should have a battery level indicator. This is important and can give you heartbreaks when you run out of power in the middle of a great shoot. It does have a low battery warning, but that comes too late.<br />2. It's not plug and play. You can't just connect this camera to your Win 2K or XP pc and download the photos. You need canon software or a CF card reader. Can be an annoyance sometimes.<br />3. The 640X480 movie resolution doesn't look great and doesn't really make sense to shoot in that mode. It looks as if 320X240 mode is digitally enlarged. The picture quality in 320X240 is satisfactory.<br />4. The text near controls got erased by use a little too early I guess. They could have used better technology for printing text onto the camera's body.<br />The facts:<br />Fact 1. When I purchased this camera, my friends had none. Now after 3 years, I can see atleast 10 of them who own Canon Powershot. This makes me believe this is the best of the lot.<br />Fact 2. I recently went to a store and wondered if a Sony or a Nikon would be better choice over Canon Powershot. The store guy told me this - \"Are you insane!\"<br />Now the verdict: Everything has cons. But ultimately I believe for a digital camera, the quality of photo matters. That stays as memory. Everything else is history.<br />You can take my word and get this one. You will thank yourself!Good luck.","I've been using a Canon G-2 and went looking for a smaller camera for my wife (wink, wink) and for travel, and ended up with the S410, a compromise trading size for features.<br />I've been using it now for a couple of months on and off, and I'm growing to like it very much. It takes excellent photographs in a variety of lighting conditions. Controls are somewhat different from the G2 and I'm still learning, but results have been generally good. It has pretty good macro capabilities.<br />(...)/<br />I would probably rate the S410 a \"5\" if it handled RAW files.","It's a good compact camera, but the LCD seems smaller. It takes very good pictures even in dark. Overall, satisfactory performance.","This is the ultimate camera for active/sporting/outdoor snapshots. It's so small you can stick it in a pocket, and yet it has flash, 3x optical zoom and 4 megapixel resolution! Because it's digital you can see the results immediately, and you don't have to worry about wasting film. Send your experiences and memories to everyone!<br />Pros:<br />* Very small and handy<br />* Unobtrusive-your friends will stop posing every time you try to take a picture! My friend Christine has mastered the art of stealth photography with her S410; she looks in a different direction while glancing at the LCD viewfinder!<br />* Uses Compact Flash (CF)- Low-cost easy to handle memory cards available in capacities up to 1 GB!<br />* Picture quality (so far) is excellent<br />Cons:<br />* Uses a rechargeable battery-This takes some extra planning and perhaps a purchase of a spare battery.<br />* Non-automatic operation is difficult-the small size makes it hard to read and navigate the controls<br />* Small size can be a danger! You could lose it accidentally or drop it out of a shirt pocket","So far, the dog has gotten our ELPH Powershot S200 (the 2.0 Megapixel version of this camera), and it's been outside through an entire day of thunderstorms and then an entire day of sunshine.  Still works perfectly.  This camera is small, easy to use, takes good pictures, and it's as strong as a tank.<br />If you're looking for something that you can drop 100 times and still work, this is the camera you want.","I received this camera for Mother's Day. It's wonderful, I can keep it in my purse and always have a camera to catch a picture.<br />It is very easy to use and takes great pictures. The pictures are very clear and noise free and have perfect color.","For about 80% of people, this camera is going to be a dream come true.<br />Simply put, it's the pinnacle of ultra compact digital camera technology.  With a 4 megapixel resolution with a better sensor than almost all of its competitors in a body the size of a pack of cigarettes, the Canon S410 is fabulous.  The buttons and other physical factors of the interface are all well designed: the zoom and shutter button are in the same place for ridiculously easy one handed operation.  The function knob on the upper right provides easy access to several shooting & playback modes.  Compare this to other recent sexy, ultra-compact powershooters by Casio & Fuji (Think Z4U and A340) and you'll understand why this is a superior camera.<br />Other pros:<br />-Canon STILL uses Compact Flash media, which is significantly cheaper than xD and sD, which a good 90% of other brands use.  I have yet to see a downside in everyday use (don't ask me about extreme temperate conditions or whether the various media survive prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields of varying strengths, as I won't know, and most people don't care).<br />-I personally like Canon's picture quality far better than that of most of its competitors, within the same style of camera.<br />-The auto-focus system is superior to all other cameras of this size and strength.  VASTLY superior.<br />Cons:<br />-Canon's movie mode is growing steadily outdated.  This is one area where you may be able to find another camera that serves better: This camera is limited to 3 minutes of 15 FPS 320 x 240 resolution motion capture, regardless of the size of your memory card.  I do, however, think that if you're that serious about wanting to record digital movies, you should look to a device more aimed at that sort of thing, like the new Panasonic digi-video-cams that take still images as a secondary function.<br />-Memory door is made of plastic, not metal like the rest of the camera, and I have seen it break.<br />-1.5\" LCD leaves something to be desired (esp. compared to Casio's line of 2\" LCD ultracompacts).<br />-No easy, pre-set scene modes like Fuji or Minolta have.<br />Reasons why you would NOT like this camera:<br />-If this is your first digital camera.  I can understand how you may be disappointed by the fact that 99% of point & shoot digital cameras do not make film-quality prints.  This is something you will just have to deal with, or not use digital cameras: short of a $700+ SLR digi camera, you will NEVER consistently get film-quality prints, and even then, you will not get the same quality as a comparably priced film camera.<br />-If you are a photo enthusiast.  Canon's Digital Elph line of cameras is designed around every day snapshooters that do not need or know how to use things like manual white balance, various aperture settings, add-on lenses, etc.  The similarly priced Canon S45 is much more along the lines of what you're looking for, if you insist on remaining in the compact category.  Otherwise, invest in a digital SLR camera, as you will be much happier.","I've been reading the reviews on this Canon PowerShot S410 camera before and after purchasing my own.  There certainly are numerous whiners out there.  It seems people love to find something to whine about.  Honestly, this camera has given me nothing but pleasure, excellent pictures and compliments from others.  This is a solid well-built camera (my cats knocked it off my desk and dragged around a bit and it had no scratches and still works excellently) with excellent picture quality both indoor and outdoor and easy to figure out menu and buttons.  People also seem to complain about the LCD screen being small on digital cameras in general.  My answer, look through the view finder.  In addition,  with the Canon S410 the image on the LCD screen is so vivid and clear and the colors so rich that it doesn't really matter.  After all, the most important thing is both the final print and how it looks on your computer not the size of the LCD screen.  When I connect the camera to my Canon CP-330 compact photo printer, it's a one press operation and away it goes printing the best quality pictures ever.  Unless you love to nit-pick (there's really nothing to nit-pick about on this one) you'll love this camera.  Minor note, Canon could have possibly been a little more generous in what comes with the camera, such as an AC power adapter (although I love the battery recharger).  However, don't consider this a complaint, just a suggestion to Canon.  If you do decide to purchase, ENJOY!  And to those whiners, life is too short .......","this camera is ok if you 're used to point and shoot (film) cameras. as for me, i doubt that i'll keep it. it pales compared to my slr. i guess i was expecting too much, but after reading all the great reviews i was sold! my biggest complaint is the dullness in color. to be fair, i'm not ruling out user error. i'll play around a bit more with it. thus far, i've been printing at home; i'll take the cf to a lab to see if it's my printer. i've been told that i have a very good printer, but i was told that the s410 as a very good camera. we'll see.<br />on the positive side, it's really convenient and lots of fun to have a digital camera.","I love this camera!! After researching digital cameras, I narrowed my search to the S410 & S500.  After looking at all the reviews for multiple sites, i notice that the S500 had more electrical problems/defects posted from people who own them.  So, i decided for the S410 and I am so happy!!  It rocks","The S410 is an excellent value, takes beautiful pictures, and is very easy to use.  If you want to shoot video though, you need to know that this camera does not allow use of the digital zoom function while it is taking a movie!  The lens remains fixed!  I was absolutely shocked when I discovered this the second day I owned it, because nothing in the technical data mentions it, and even the S410 Owners Manual has it buried.  The video features were one of the prime reasons we purchased this camera instead of another Nikon, and we were disappointed to find it incapable of something our ancient Coolpix 775 could do.  We are not happy right now.","Pros:<br />Powerful Flash<br />Cons:<br />High Cost<br />Less intuitive menu function<br />Despite having a 9 point AiAF, poor auto focus<br />Small LCD screen<br />Blurry,un-focused indoor pictures, despite the reviews I have read.<br />After reading the positive reviews on Amazon and other sites my girlfriend and I went out and bought one of these cameras.  One of the main selling points for us was the supposed great indoor photos.  One of the complaints about my camera, Casio Exilim Z4U was that the indoor/low light pics can come out grainey at the least.  I don't know if the S410 we purchased was defective, but auto focus stank in general and more than half the pictures we took indoors came out unfocused.  The Menu navigation stinks.  In auto mode one can not change focusing preferences, EV shift or any of the other settings for focus.  The focusing in Macro mode is lack luster also.  Believe it or not, my Casio (Not the best I am sure) took better, sharper in door pics, and did a much better job in macro mode (I think the Casio is pretty good in Macro mode) at close up objects.<br />In summery, I was not impressed at all with this camera.  We took it back and are still looking for another camera.  I would have given this camera two stars but I was trying to be fair considering I don't know if this camera was defective.","I've owned a number of SLR and point-and-shoot cameras over the years but this little guy gives me sharp, clear photos wherever I am and downloads them via USB in a few seconds so I can edit them or send them to friends via Ofoto. At a dinner for 25 people at home recently, the movie mode allowed me to capture the real feeling of the evening along with the stills - neat! I also bought a 128mb chip and a spare battery to make sure I don't run out of storage or power on sightseeing trips and a leather case to fit on my belt which keeps it with me when I want it. All in all, I'm really happy with this camera.","My first Canon digital camera was actually called IXUS (branding in Asia & Europe) because my son's godmother bought it for us in transit through Tokyo 5 years ago.  It is the same size as the S410 and we used it all the time because of the size.  When we lost our IXUS earlier this year, there was no doubt we will get another in the ELPH series.  We bought the S410 instead of the S500 becaue of the balance between the price and Pixal counts.  We love our S410.  Simply put: we use this camera (IXUS/S410) because it is the only one we bring everywhere we go (over 12 countries and 21 states), and it is easy to use.  The ZoomBrower software is easy to use and my six year old son can use it.  Canon keeps it simple even with all the additional features since my first Canon digital IXUS.  It is not the smallest camera in the marketplace, but it is that perfect combination of features and size.  By the way, our IXUS was US$799 5 years ago and it only had 2.1 Meg.","Regardless of what style of digital you choose - make sure it is Canon.  These, like all of their cameras are great.  I currently use the Canon Rebel and I am looking at the digital rebel.  I am not a big brand name person - unless it counts.  It counts with Canon.  Here is a link to some photos taken with the 35mm Rebel.  Canon is a great company.<br />[...]","I want to point out that you should never buy a generic battery, like the person from San Diego who reviewed the S410 on May 15, 2004, was recommending.  Yes you'd save money, but there have been many reports of generic batteries exploding when charged for too long.  And don't think if your generic battery explodes you can sue somebody and win millions.  These batteries are made in sweatshops in China, India and Korea, and I doubt you can find anybody to sue.  So play it safe, both for your own sake and the camera's sake.  If you want a spare, get a real Canon one.","Rcvd from Amazon about 6 wks ago.  Great camera.  I was suprised to get higher quality prints than from my old 35mm.  See full review on epinions.com.  Battery life is fine but needs more memory!  I get 17 shots on the CF card that came with it.","Compact, light, affordable, and quality are the 4 words that describe this camera. The Canon S410 provides top-notch photos with vibrant colors and amazaing detail. It is one of the smallest cameras in its class contained inside a rich, strong metal body and an excellent rigid shape designed for the use of one hand. It provides adequate night shooting (wide range of shutter times), great macro shots (closeups), and a good host of functions (rapid shots, photostitch) needed for the beginning/intermediate photographer. Although it does not have many of the advanced features of other cameras in its classes, most users will not need them as point-and-shoot is generally what is desired. This camera will not disappoint as it's quality and size will make picture taking an enjoyable experience. This 4MP camera with its adequate functions will be the camera that will last for a lifetime.<br />Pros:<br />1) Small, light, good looking<br />2) Excellent quality, zoom, colors, macro shots, night shots<br />3) Easy to use, good battery life<br />4) Great beginning/intermediate functions<br />Cons:<br />1) No battery display indicator (only displays when time to recharge)<br />2) No advanced functions<br />3) No scene modes","I own a 10D which I absolutely love and was getting tired of using my old Olympus Epic (a GREAT film camera) and was looking for a good digital point and shoot. My two major candidates were the S410 and the S50 and possibly the new S60 (not yet released at the time of this review).<br />If you follow the photography boards at all you realize that this is a fairly common dilemma - the S410 or S400 vs the S50. The S50 offers excellent manual controls while the S400/S410 is significantly smaller without any manual control whatsoever other than exposure compensation. I just LOVE the look and feel of the S410 though if anything it could be argued that it is TOO small. If you feel it is and you are looking for a carry everywhere camera it is well worth the effort to get used to the small size because the camera takes beautiful pictures.<br />The S400 is simply beautiful. I can live without all the manual controls since I own the 10D and since this camera is primarily for my wife and for me when I don't want to lug the 10D around.<br />Several have pointed out that since this camera is so small it will always be with you whereas the S50 would be less likely to be carried along because of its increased size. This is a very good argument! The camera is SUBSTANTIALLY smaller than its bigger brother the S50. The form and size factors are what finally won me over.<br />One criticism of the camera. Low light focusing is less than ideal. You need to work with the camera to understand its limitations indoors.<br />I am a huge fan of the Canon cameras and I would advise anyone looking for a camera, whether a point and shoot or a DSLR to carefully consider the Canon line since, in my opinion, Canon currently represents the state of the art.","I've owned the S410 for a couple of months and I give it 4 Stars. This camera targets a particular kind of consumer and it does a great job of it. I've seem some hard-core enthusiasts portray a negative picture of the S410 as well as it predecessor the S400, and I believe it is unfair.<br />This camera was a gift for my wife. My wife will carry a camera only if,<br />1. It is relatively light in weight,<br />2. It is compact (fits in her pocket-book), and,<br />3. It will think for itself.<br />The Canon does these well, and is meant for consumers like my wife. Switch on and shoot!<br />My wife upgraded from the Canon Elph (APS) to the S410. If the SD110 had a 3x zoom, we'd probably have gone with it. The S410 is built in stainless steel and is built like a tank. You will feel this in the weight of the camera. It is not the smallest or lightest out there, but it's one of the best when it comes to balance between weight and size. It feels very comfortable in the hand.<br />The buttons are sized and laid out very well. I like the mode-select wheel, which is particularly advantageous to people with large fingers. People who have not used Canon P&S cameras will be pleasantly surprised by the zoom controls. The zoom encompasses the shutter-button and is extremely intuitive.<br />The menus are self-explanatory and relatively simple to use, though it does take a little getting used to the menu mechanics.<br />The most used controls, macro mode, flash modes, metering modes and timer functions have hot keys and are selectable without accessing menus - a big advantage to accommodating last second changes.<br />There is a short startup lag, so don't expect to just pick-up and shoot. The auto-focus is fast. There is a delay between depressing shutter and capture, but is about the same as other cameras in this class. There is also a slight lag between shots, but again, is the same as other cameras in this class. One glaring issue is that the red-eye reduction is not very effective. To speed up shot-capture, switch this mode-off. It really helps!!<br />The photos are AMAZING! Indoors and outdoors, the photos are crisp, the colors vibrant and life-like, and, this was very surprising to me...the camera could capture depth. The photos are truly a pleasure to look at.......you can experience Canon's over 50 years of optic and technology expertise at work here. (FYI, I'm a NIKON person...it is huge for me to say this!!)<br />Why only four-stars?!!<br />1. Strong, over-powering flash. The flash is SO strong that it hurts subjects 5 feet away. You can literally feel the heat. There is a high possibility of flash-spots or wash-outs in case your subject is in front of a reflective surface.<br />2. This might be related to the strong flash...the front of the camera body becomes \"very warm\" but not \"hot\" after taking a few photos (approx. 10), with the flash on, in succession. I guess the metallic body heats up.<br />3. Auto-Focus. The auto focus can get annoying at times, especially if two subjects are nearly the same distance from the camera. It'll keep shuttling between the two subjects. The multi-zone AF is one of the reasons I did not buy a Canon SLR a few years ago. I find it inconvenient.<br />Overall, I think this is a great camera. It balances mega-pixel resolution, optics, technology, size, weight, price, and features-functionality in a compact package.<br />If you're the kind of person who likes getting great photos without working for them, this is the camera to buy.","Recently my girlfried and I decided to purchase a new digital camera to go with our new computer. I wish I could speak to the process of getting information on digital cameras from the big box stores. (Man, talk about uniformed.) Basically I decided on this model because of many friends' reccomendations and the reviews I read online. Let me assure you that the reviews are all correct. This camera is nearly bulletproof in it's pros and the cons are no different that any other digital camera- battery life is a little short. Just buy an extra battery. I chose this model because it uses cheap media to record the images and does so very quickly. I compared this against the Olympus 410 splashproof. The reviews were also correct that the Olympus lags so much in taking the photo that the moment is gone. With a simple menu change one can activate,\" Quickshot,\" on the Canon S410 and picture response time increases significantly. This camera is extremely easy to use and within a day you'll want to start experimenting with all the extra modes. The color is so vivid the it makes my 17\" LCD monitor look like a window. I really want to thank the other reviewers of this product. You were all a great help in my purchase decision. I do not regret purchasing this model in any way!","I too recently purchased the Canon S410 and love it.  It's amazingly lightweight and compact.  Fits easily and discreetly in my pants or jacket pocket.  Yet packs as much power as many of it's 4 megapixel toting brethren.<br />However I thought I should make a quick correction on the prior review in order to prevent consumers from being misled.  The Canon S500 comes with the 640 x 480 video resolution but the Canon S410 does not.  The S410 only has 320 x 240 and 160 x 120 video resolutions.<br />The one immediately noticable difference between the S400 and the S410 is the addition of the Direct Print button on the back of the S410.  This allows the user to connect the S410 directly to a Direct Print or PictBridge compatible printer (not necessarily a Canon brand printer) and allows him to print straight from the camera (rather than using a flash card reader or interfacing through a computer).","The Canon PowerShot S410 is a slightly upgraded version of the immensely popular S400 model, which has been discontinued and can be found for close to three-hundred bux.  I think since the S410 is only slightly improved -- it is slightly faster than the S400 and sports a new print/share button which I'm not sure you'll be using a lot if you are the typical user -- the S400 is a much better buy.<br />That said, the S410 will be the new standard bearer for 4MP digital cameras.  It has a compact form factor, although not as small or light as offerings from Minolta or Pentax or Casio, and it's a bit heavier than you might have expected from the size.  It puzzles me why Canon continues to use the older CompactFlash memory card as opposed to the more-standard Secure Digital format.  Maybe they simply wanted to save money in upgrading the S4xx series.  The plus side is, CF cards are a lot cheaper than SD ones for the same capacity, although the difference is shrinking as expected.<br />Like the S400, the S410 produces excellent image qualities, both indoors and outdoors.  It's got the best color and exposure balance from automatic programs among all the cameras I have tested/used.  The S410 is slightly faster in taking pictures than the S400, but image quality is largely the same.  You won't be disappointed.<br />And as before, the S410 is easy to use, with buttons that aren't too small like on ultra-subcompact cameras from Casio or Pentax.  Battery life is about the same as before, which is pretty good and should last you a whole day of moderate shooting.  As always, turning off the LCD (via a simple press of the Disp button), turning off the flash, avoid zooming in and out frequently, and using a lower resolution and lower quality will all help preserve battery life (this comes in handy when you realize the battery is about to run out).<br />I wish Canon had increased the optical zoom.  3X is standard but not adequate in a lot of situations, e.g., shooting a stage play your kid's in.  But this is only a minor complaint for a camera in this price class.<br />For another hundred bux more, you can get the 5MP S500 model.  Should you go for this or the S500?  I think for most consumers 4MP is plenty enough, with room for cropping and enlargements.  5MP is only necessary if you really crop a lot.  The S410 strikes a great balance between pixel count and price -- it's a good value.","I'll keep this review short since I'm sure there will be a lot more coming soon... The main thing I noticed that was different and an improvement over the S400 is the ability to shoot 640x480 VGA Videos up to One minute in length (versus 3 minutes for the 320x240 and 160x120 modes) but at this resolution it consumes a lot of memory/storage space... It's ironic that the original S200 (2MP) had this 640x480 VGA movie recording ability but it was only good for 6 seconds which of course is quite useless! Both the S230 (3MP) and S400 (4MP) removed this ability for some reason, and many folks have been asking... WHY?... and I guess Canon finally listed to the customers and brought this S200 feature back!!<br />The little speaker on the S410 just like the S400 and SD100 is really nice when playing back videos you record! This feature was missing on the S200 and S230 Canons...<br />With the price of Compact Flash memory cards dropping, just pickup a few extra memory cards and you'll be recording some nice videos in no time! Not to mention the photographs it takes are awesome as well! Instead of bringing both the digital camcorder and camera, we now just bring the Canon instead!<br />Truly an amazing camera!! It'll be interesting to see how the S500 compares to the S410!"]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S500 (Digital IXUS 500 / IXY Digital 500)","amazon_reviews":["Canon PowerShot S500 5MP Digital Elph with 3x Optical Zoom. Small but nice pictures.","The Canon Powershot S500 is the last of the Elph series capable of using large Compact Flash memory cards. If you have a professional quality DSLR two years old or older it probably uses these cards. The S500 has an optical viewfinder, a feature missing on most current P&S cameras but almost essential when taking pictures in bright sunlight. The sensor has high enough resolution to take decent 11x14 pictures. Two of mine, taken with this camera, were recently accepted at a big regional photo show.

The S500 has an optical viewfinder, a feature missing on most current P&S cameras but almost essential when taking pictures in bright sunlight.

The flash is pretty powerful. This is the best cannon camera for all those people who want to keep the camera in pockets and not in bag or hand.","A birthday gift for my daughter. Lots of great digital pictures were the result!  Great quality pictures, the only minor problem was a loose on/off knob.  It still works but requires more attention than it should.  But still takes super quality pics....","I'm surprised to see that a lot of people only give 1* to this camera! I've had it for 2 years now and i just love it! Thanks to it, I discovered I had a real passion for photography... It's very easy to use and my pictures are great! When I show them, people usually tell me \" you must have an expensive camera\"... and i just show them my little Canon S500 and they are surprised with the result!<br /><br />I'm just loving it!","This was my first digital camera that I have ever bought, and I am completely satisfied with it. Talk abt the resolution or the camera's feature. All of it is packed into one small sleek camera. I recommend this digital camera to everybody. And I would say if I would decided later in future to get another one. I would alwayz go for Canon. They are the best in making Digital Cameras.","I needed to replace a lost S4oo we had for about a year. Looked at the SD series and thought them too small for comfort. There is such a thing as too thin to handle comfortably. The S500 is, like the S400, just right in size. Big area on back for thumb so you an even one-hand hold it. Try that with any SD. Pictures are excellent for a hand-held. Not Nikon N70 film SLR good, but plenty good enough for any snapshot purpose. Bought one of last new S500's available at NewEgg abd very, very happy with it.","This is my second day owning this camera and it is replacing my S50 which I have been using for the past three years. The reason why I bought it was mainly because of the compact size compared to my bulky s50 and also the video mode produced better quality videos than the s50. So far I love this camera!<br /><br /> I have been comparing shots with the s50 and s500 and one thing that I did notice is that the LCD is of a better quality on the s50 and that would mean the images would look much better when viewing from the LCD monitor. I was able to view images that I took with the s500 on the s50 and the images from the s500 looked much sharper , clearer and superior. So I will be keeping the s500 for a long while. I also noticed a few unhappy customers that experienced error problems or LCD cracks. For those, I would recommend that you purchase the camera from a store that will issue a refund like COSTCO , this is my first choice in purchasing digital cameras because you can return it at any time whether its 1 month or 1 year from now, as long as you have the receipt. And they will issue a full refund, plus I got it $100 cheaper at costco off of the retail price.<br /><br />Also in response to another reviewers concerns about speeding up the shutter speed. All you have to do is change the image capture mode to the \"action\" mode.<br /><br />And please read all of the manual! I 'm pretty sure the error screen is appearing because the format of the av/out is not matching up correctly. You have to pick the right format befor you connect it to your tv.","I bought this camera to replace a larger Kodak I had.  I was looking for something smaller that could fit in my purse but wanted great quality pictures.  I do a lot of scrapbooking, so I needed the zoom quality options.<br /><br />I take this camera everywhere to capture opportune pictures so it has taken a beating and still works great. (I did accidentally drop it in a creek once and it stopped working.  I contacted Canon and they fixed the camera for $75.  As mentioned in a couple of other reviews I have read, they are very water sensitive.)<br /><br />I have been very happy with the quality of the pictures.  I have an HP Photosmart 100 and can print the pictures right off the card.  Have also designed web-sites and have been able to use the pictures on them.","i bought this camera after i lost my old canon s230 (3.2MP). i was going to buy the same camera but then decided to upgrade to a 5MP.<br /><br />i am already familiar with this series of cameras so i wasn't expecting much of a difference, but i was in for a shock.<br /><br />on my old s230 the flash wasn't very powerful and the digital zoom was never worth using since the pics would come out blurry. also it was an annoying delay when taking action shots.<br /><br />the new s500 fixed all these pet peeves and i am amazed at the quality of pics. the flash range is great and you can use the digital zoom and still get great pictures. also there is a new mode that takes pics superfast so you won't miss that special moment.<br /><br />definitely a great upgrade from older S-series.","This is the first digital camera I have ever purchased (I bought it for myself as an early graduation present), and I read tons of reviews before settling on this camera. This is the ideal camera for people who like to carry around a camera all the time because of its compact size, and it takes EXCELLENT pictures!<br /><br />Pros: compact size but big enough to easily hold onto it, works well indoors and outdoors, flash is great, almost no delay when you press the button and when it takes the picture (a problem I noticed with other cameras), pictures come out with very high resolution even when they are cropped and enlarged, the screen on the camera moves very quickly and smoothly, you can adjust many of the modes with the buttons on the camera rather than going to the menu option (very convenient for changing the flash option quickly), the software makes it VERY easy to upload your pictures onto your computer, the battery charger is very easy and convenient to use, and the case for this camera fits like a glove if you decide to purchase it.<br /><br />Cons: no battery life indicator (I solved this problem by purchasing an extra battery to carry around with me), screen is kinda small.<br /><br />As you can see, the pros greatly outweigh the cons. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone. My dad is a fanatic about taking pictures (not sure what kind of Canon he has, but I think it is a Canon Digital Rebel), and the pictures I take with my camera are comparable in quality with his. I have had my camera for almost 3 months now, and I have never had any problems with it! It took perfect pictures for my prom and graduation, and all my friends were begging for copies of my pictures because they were so great. If you are debating over getting a lower megapixel (like the 4 megapixel version of this Canon), I'm sure it would also work as well as this one (especially if you are going to buy normal 4x6 prints for most of your photos), but I have never had any experience with that particular camera. Canon seems to make high quality cameras, and this particular model would be the perfect camera for anyone.","I've only had the camera for a few days, but so far it's great.  It's easy to use, takes beautiful pictures, and it looks good.","I have owned the Canon S500 for 7+ months now and taken over 1000 pictures. I must say that this is a highly capable camera in its class. It's neither too tiny to handle nor big enough so as not to fit in a small pocket. It has more control than a simple point & shoot camera and gives consistently high results.<br />The LCD though small is higher in resolution and it makes it look better than the bigger but grainier LCD's on certain Sony models.<br /><br /> Surely, small cameras like these are never comparable to professional ones but i would find it impractical to carry a big SLR everywhere! Pictures taken carefully (i.e. proper conditions and settings), are really capable of standing high among the results of much better cameras.<br /><br />Even though there are newer, sleeker cameras with better video capabilities, I reiterate that when it comes to still picture quality, the S500 is one of the most capable in its size and resolution category.<br /><br /> Finally, you must always remember that a camera with (x+1) mega pixels does not necessarily offer superior quality than one with x mega pixels resolution.","This digital camera isn't really mine though.  My dad bought this camera last summer and this camera is pretty cool because it was voted on TIME Magazine that this camera was one of 2004's hottest and best technology.  The picture quality is good and you can zoom in as far as you want to.  You can also take videos but you may need a bigger Memory card if you want to take videos and pictures together.","This is a fantastic camera. Its true you can get yours free...<br /> [...] GOOD LUCK","This is an outstanding camera if you want a 5MP that you can easily take with you wherever you go.

I don't want to travel by air with expensive equipment that the morons at the airport toss around while they trash your carryon, I also don't like the \"stupid American tourist, pls pickpocket me\" look that an SLR around the neck labels you.<br /><br />Enter the S500, compact flash compatibility with the Canon dSlR's should you ever upgrade, ultraportable for shirtpocket storage, quick startup for those once in a lifetime photo ops, and the accessories are as light and easy to carry as the camera.  The only thing missing is a 10x zoom, but with 5mp, you have plenty of pixels available to crop and still get a great \"enlarged\" shot of the one subject you wanted in the picture.<br /><br />Menus are intuitive if you cut your teeth on canon digital cameras previous to this one, and use other canon digitals besides this one.<br /><br />Cons - old tech in digital camera age. if you are just starting out, look at the other memory media which allow even smaller ultracompacts.  Doubt there will be a Canon S700 with compact flash card storage, but if you lug Canon dSLR's around at other times, or plan to upgrade to Canon dSlR's in the future, the memory media standarization with the S500 is a godsend to protect your memory card investment.  and the current price of the S500 is a bahgain!","The get-a-Canon Powershot-for-free \"offers\" you see spewed everywhere on Amazon don't work!

It was nice that the 2 batterys that I had worked, and I also now have an additional charger.  Picture quality is great...a little red eye here and there, but I think that is more from my picture taking.  Included software is good, but i'd recommend Picasa 2...free download from Google, for Window's users.  It's as close to iPhoto that I can find for XP.  Pictures developed via Walmart look spectacular.  512 mb card helps.  The 128 card that I had before would only hold 50 pictures from this camera...","I did a bake-off vs a Pentax Optio & was quite surprised how much better  this camera's photos usually were.<br /><br />All were in our living room. The Optio had more trouble getting a good focus in less-than-bright indoor light. There was much less detail in its results when the focus WAS right (even after tweaking the \"JPEG details\" settings).<br /><br />Especially I found less noise in the darker areas of the Canon's photos. Due to a bigger light sensor, which makes the camera a bit bulkier? Could be the reason, and a point to consider when you want a real ultra-compact / ultra light small camera.<br /><br />There WERE a couple of shots where the Pentax colors looked a bit more natural. Maybe variations in brightness? Anyway, the differences were modest and neither was displeasing.<br /><br />My wife was (very!) disappointed when she first got this camera (a birthday gift) because she'd focused on her friend's smaller ligher Optio. But when she kept getting compliments on her shots, while her friend had frequent disappointments, she changed her mind.","Especially considering the price, this camera is a fantastic buy. I've used several different digital cameras, and this is definitely the best(Olympus C-765, Pentax Optio S4, several Olympus Camedias). That being said, I have a few complaints:<br /><br />Flash - Indoor scenes often have too little light to take a picture without a flash, but regardless of how little light there is inside, a flash will always make the pictures look incredibly washed out at ranges closer than about eight feet or so. More than ten feet will result in a blurred, low quality image that really doesn't benefit at all from the flash. So, for low lighting, get a tripod-- and get a decent tripod, too, the cheap ones are really unstable.<br /><br />Batteries - Third party batteries cost me something like $5, and they work for maybe three recharges-- so do NOT buy one of these. The OEM batteries are exorbitant, though.<br /><br />Lens size - A tiny lens means a tiny camera, but it also means a camera that can't take pictures that require a lot of light-- you either use a flash(losing color quality), or take a very blurred picture. For some reason, as well, low-lighting conditions often result in bizarre white balance. Indoor pictures always seem too orange, however I set it...<br /><br />Additional praise:<br /><br />Focus - Generally works out to be perfect or near-perfect.<br /><br />Movie Mode - I don't expect it to be like a professional video camera, but for what it is, it works quite well. The microphone's easily twice as good as iPod mics I've used..<br /><br />Size - It's so small! And the design is incredibly well thought-out. Everything's in the right place, and easy to use.<br /><br />Quality - Picture quality is fairly consistent if you have the right ISO settings-- I usually use medium or high quality on S or M2-- low quality small pictures are only worth it if you want to just show them to friends and take a zillion, they're not really suitable for printing.<br /><br />While I think I might rather have an EOS Rebel ideally, I'd rather go with something that's 1/3 the price and half the size. Good work, Canon! =P","I love this camera.  I really didn't know what kinda of camera would be good for me being that my husband & I ride quads and we needed something compact but that would also take crisp shots.  This is the best camera I've ever used.  I was a bit hesitant about the size because most cameras that take good quality pictures don't come that small, but this is definitely worth every penny.  And Amazon has it for the lowest price anywhere online.","I am new to the digital camera market. 4 weeks to be exact. I previously owned a cannon 35mm film camera. I am pleasantly surprised at the color and sharpness of the photos. I went with the advice of other reviewers and only use Cannon Photo paper. I also bought one of their printers. IP 4000. The combo is a winning one. The basic features are simply to use just reading a few directions.","This is the best camera. I have two small kids this camera fits in my purse but takes really clear pictures.","Takes great photos. Works great all the time. I can't think of a thing wrong with it. I am very happy with it.","I can't say enough about how great this little camera is!  I bought it in anticipation of a 10 day trip to Europe and it outperformed even my high expectations.  I've had some experience with photography, a few classes, and some nice cameras (all Canon's) in the past but this is my first digital.<br /><br />As I wanted to make sure I had enough coverage for the trip (hence the 5mp purchase), I added a 512 MB card and spare battery to my order.  Just over 200 pictures later (at full resolution), I have the photo record of a lifetime!  The images are clear and crisp and the color is excellent.  Even on cloudy days the camera captured great shots.  And even though I took the manual along, the camera is so intuitive I never had to use it.  I played with the various settings throughout but if all you want is easy high quality images you'd never have to bother.  I love that you can preview the pictures on screen and delete them if you're not satisfied.  The battery is long lasting - one would take me through the day and charge up overnight (the extra was a little overkill but appreciated in situations where I couldn't immediately charge).<br /><br />Since returning from the trip, I've transferred the images to my laptop, uploaded the images to Ofoto to share with family and friends, written slide presentations to cd, and had pictures printed in 4x6, 5x7, and 8x10.  All have amazing quality and have received great reviews from whoever has seen them.  In fact, 7 framed pictures are in my office and many think they've been professionally taken and purchased!  The quality of the camera and prints, coupled with the ease of use of the camera and software is outstanding.<br /><br />Recently, I purchased an iBook and Canon PIXMA ip3000 printer.  The Canon connected to the iBook without installing the Canon software package and interfaces seamlessly with iPhoto.  Although I haven't had a chance to print from the laptop yet I did connect my Digital Elph directly to the printer.  On the sample paper that was included, I printed 3 images directly from the Elph.  All are great, straight from the camera with no color alterations or cropping.  I can't wait to see how they print with a little tweaking on the laptop!<br /><br />Well done Canon!  This is a combination I anticipate having for a long time.","I can't say enough good things about this camera.  Great pics, tons of options and it's small to boot.  Ever since I got this camera, I'm amazed of the picture quality.  The only negative is that it lacks a preview button to view the last picture taken.  Otherwise, the camera takes great pics indoor and out.  I often do not even need a flash in a normally lit room.","LIKES<br /><br />1) Nice compact size. Easy to carry.<br /><br />2) Great pictures for about 90% of the shots.<br /><br />3) Great features. Video mode. Manual mode. Sounds and Wallpaper (Themes).<br /><br />4) Uses Compact Flash which is the cheapest type of memory.<br /><br />5) Runs on same battery as the S100 (my old camera) so I have spare.<br /><br />6) Browse/Zoom feature is great when reviewing photos (improved a lot since S100)<br /><br />7) Decent price (paid about 320$) for 5MP camera back in Dec 04.<br /><br />DISLIKES<br /><br />1) Pictures come out a little on the reddish/yellowish side indoors for 10% of the shots, so I use the Manual Tungsten mode and it comes out nice.<br /><br />2) Video shooting on highest mode is choppy and skips w/ audio playback. I recommend using the middle quality and dont move the scene too much while recording.<br /><br />3) Video is suppose to shoot only 30 seconds, but I found that using my 1GB fast CF, it can do it longer by separating into chunks then you can stitch together later on your PC.<br /><br />4) LCD is a little smaller than usual (but its good in a way so it saves batteries)<br /><br />5) Only comes with 32MB CF. I wish the digital camera industry can just do away without memory cards in the package. Buyers end up buying a bigger faster memory card anyways, so why not save us a few bucks?","I originally purchased the Canon s500 because I wanted a small, portable camera that would take decent pictures. That's exactly what I got.<br /><br />There's no doubt about it that there are cameras out there who take better quality picture than this one. Originally I got this camera thinking that it was more important that I get the shot than that the shot be completely flawless. I must say, when I first got the camera and took some test shots with it I was pleasantly surprised with just how nice the pictures turned out. I rarely shoot in the full 5 mega-pixel mode, as for me it's over-kill. Yet the camera still produces very nice pictures. Add to the great photo quality the camera's small size and you've got a great package.<br /><br />Build quality on the camera is very nice. The metal casing feels substantial and sturdy in your hands. Unfortunately, I've dropped the camera a few times, yet it still works flawlessly. The camera uses a proprietary, rechargeable battery, so you can't pop in typical alkalines if need be. This may be a drawback for some; however the battery is nice and compact, and seems to work just fine for me.<br /><br />The only drawback to this camera, at least that I've encountered, is the flash. It does a nice job of illuminating subjects up to ~10 feet away. Being a small camera, much beyond that and the flash isn't bright enough and pictures come out somewhat dark. Overall I believe this is a great camera. Its small size, great picture quality, and good usability make this camera a winner.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you're looking for a compact camera with great picture quality you can't go wrong with the S500.","AWESOME FIRST DIGITAL CAMERA.IVE HAD IT FOR 2 DAYS.MORE FUN THAN A BARREL OF MONKEYS.ive had it for a couple months now & cant find just a canon camera bag i like.most universal bags dont fit quit right.","I bought this camera few days back and results look amazing.  The only thing I would agree that its pretty techy.<br /><br />You'll need to read the manual before doing some operations.","Just upgraded from Canon S100 to Canon S500. Very happy with it. Same steel case and small size... perfect for mobile use. The main reasons I upgraded to the S500 are the 5MP imaging and the ability to capture videos. The newer options for continous shooting mode and video clips are handy. The audio on the video clip came out surprising well and the subject was 50 feet away too. Added a 1 GB CF card for plenty of storage space (video and photos). Picture quality is very good on photos. The *very bright* flash can wash out images in a close up while in darker areas (not in sun light), so I usually turn off the flash and the photos come out fine.<br /><br />New camera software (ZoomBrowser) works better than the older version that came with the S100 ... I make my edits in PhotoShop. Slick package.<br /><br />Five stars for value in a small, durable package. Glad I upgraded.","This camera has proven to be quite an excellent companion.  The pictures have decent quality and the battery life is excellent.  It's survived a few drops on concrete with some serious nicks and scrapes, but the camera continues to function like a champ.  The quick start up and small size make it easily fit in a pocket which will make you more likely to have the camera close by for those 'canon' moments that can come at any time.  The pictures print in excellent quality (use an HP photojet with a Mac).  The software with that comes with the camera is sufficient with the stitching software proving to be quite capable.  I use other programs such as elements and iphoto for all other photo work which is usually superior to any photo software that comes with any camera.  The durability and battery life have me sold on this camera.  The picture quality is fine for my needs although I would like to be able to adjust the flash intensity for close up shots (currently try to filter the light with my finger over the flash which somewhat works).  This camera replaces an older 3MP Sony camera with much satisfaction.","I've just upgraded from a Canon A50, after toting it around for the past 4 years and putting it through loads of abuse. I've recommended Canon digital cameras to everyone I know and I've yet to hear a complaint. This camera was EVEN SMALLER than expected...easily HALF the size of my A50! They are not joking when they say it is the size of a deck of cards. Especially since my reason for upgrading was to have a small, yet powerful digital that I can carry along in a waist pack when I run the Honolulu Marathon next week.<br /><br />My limited tests can be seen in the customer image library above, but I am sufficiently impressed to write my review immediately. I did make sure to buy a new camera rather than a refurbished model because I did have two problems with my old Canon, which required the 1-year warranty (you only get 90 days with refurbished). Since the repairs on that old camera, I've not had a problem in the last 3.5 years...despite dropping it a few too many times. The S500 has the same solid construction and aluminum casing, which should also protect it from mild abuse from its owner (I'd also recommend getting a nice little neoprene case for it...they may not always be pretty, but they're amazing protection!).<br /><br />I've not had enough experience yet with it to speak about its battery life, but from past experience, Canons have better than average battery life, which I extend even further by limiting the use of the LCD screen. This models battery isn't much larger than a compact flash card, so I'm interested to see if it's as reliable as their other rechargable batteries. They did one major improvement in the battery charger that is worth noting...it doesn't have a cord. Much like the Apple Powerbook power cord, it has the prongs that fold out for charging and fold in for storage. Such a nice, tidy design for something that is normally cumbersome.<br /><br />I have my degree in photography from Art Center in Pasadena, CA, so I feel qualified to give two solid thumbs up to this camera. It's not professional grade, of course, and any camera with a built-in flash can often give you red-eye or harsh shadows, but it's perfect for snapshots, vacation photos, ebay shots and having fun without carrying around a ton of equipment. It seems that most digitals do their job best when you just use the flash as fill, rather than your only light source...or better yet, turn the flash off and let the ambient light do its job. I know this one has quite a few manual override functions for shutter speeds and such, but I haven't had time to explore them very much yet.<br /><br />My last suggestion would be to get a very large compact flash card in addition to the one that the camera comes with. I purchased a 1GB Ultra 2 from Sandisk (I found one for about $80), and it's very fast and will hold well over 100 uncompressed images. That will keep you from fiddling around with multiple cards when you're out and about. I felt a bit frivilous when I first ordered it, but now I am very happy I did.","I just bought one of the S500 it a sweet toy.  I was recently looking to buy a digital camera. I have a Petax SLR which my bro has been using for his photography classes.  My bro also had a digital camera but it is a couple years old and batteries have been kinda short lived (canon S45?).  I borrowed it for a while and enjoyed it but it was still too big and heavy.  I really enjoyed my real camera, but I realized my slr is not something that I can bring to a party in my pocket.  I really wanted something small without compromising the image quality.  So I did my home work.  I looked at sony, pentax, casio, nikon,and of course canon. I had my heart settled on a T1 or the new yet to be realeased T3.  5 megapixls and a huge screen and tiny as hell.  But the memory sticks sony uses in particular the duo is small in capacity and pricy.  I was still not entirely dishearted.  When I had some free time I went to a Sony Style store.  He told me due to the small lense size that the color saturation is not the best.  He tried selling me a different sony but they did not catch my eye.  Then I started workin backwards. what is the biggest memory card type?  Compactflash. Best bang for buck? CompactFlash.  Same type of card my bro has too.  So then I favored canon and nikon.  I immediately zoomed in on the s500.  Small fairly light.  Kinda on the heavy side for its size, but not bad at all.  Recharable Li-Ion.  Short movies, 5mp, 3x optical zoom but you knew that.  It had my bro's camera beat.  I bought 2 1gb lexar cards incase one died on me, a spare battery, leather case and compactflash card reader to go with this new toy.  I love it.  I just went on vacation and I did not need to change the battery until the last night.  It was great at parties right into my pocket.  I snuck it into a dashboard concert and got some great picks too.  Did not even need to be that close.  For its size it compromises some of the more advanced features that the s-(doubledigit) line has but I haven't found anything I am missing so far.  I highly recomend getting a Compact flash card reader.  They plug and play with almost any OS mac or PC, and you can avoid all the messy camera software.  I have not tried canon's latest but with the reader I have no need or desire too.  The other benefit is with the reader your memory card doubles for file transfers.  Anyway great buy.","The top end of the S digital Elph series camera is now the s500. It is a great, reliable camera with excellent performance, especially compared with my old 230.<br /><br />Pro:  Light, easy to use, has advanced feeatures if you are advanced, and reliable, decent battery life, and well recognized camera.<br /><br />Con:  They still never have figured out the problems with the movie/manual settings/movie being so close together.  Also the Shoot/play toggle is frequently found in the wrong position.  Not smart enough to take nightime pictures and still see any lights.  Still sluggish on startup.<br /><br />And the software?  I never installed mine, and pitched the disc.  I believe in iPhoto.  However, I found ... uh ... movies stay on the camera unless you have the software.  That would be nice.  But they only let you download the update version.  *Shrug*  Guess its my fault.  Now how do I fix it?","Did a bit of online research after reading another review regarding condensation problems. Please note that<br /><br />condensation seems to be a problem with any make, model and type of camera. This however doesn't seam to be as widespread as mentioned, and/or confined to one make.<br /><br />Below a link to someone that experienced the same problem with a Sony.<br /><br />http://www.digital-camera-reviews.info/html/digital-camera-reviews-2.cfm?Make=Sony&Model=DSC%20S%2075<br /><br />Keep you camera in plastic bag when in hot and humid conditions, store it with silica and keep it out of water (obviously).","The Canon S500 5MP camera is everything you can hope: small, easy to use, reliable, great pictures, and cool.  You can truly put it in your pocket and take it anywhere.  As with most digital cameras, it could be faster in taking the picture from the time the shutter button is pressed, but the S500 is better than most.  The battery life and battery life indicator could both be improved.","some of these reviews are terrible.  for someone to complain about \"it always takes blurry pics or needs lots of color correction\" is beyond belief OR you have a bad camera - hey, built by humans, so there's got to be some that are just bad.<br /><br />i just took plenty of santa pics today at the mall... while we were waiting for my kids to come up, guess what, i experimented and must have taken 20 shots to see what was going to work... hey, yes there were some blurry ones due to ME moving the camera, but when i held it still the pics were crytal clear - and you can check this with the easy to use ZOOM IN feature while reviewing the pics.<br /><br />i started 6-7 years ago with digital cameras with a olympus 1.3 megapixel.  then a canon g3 and a $1000 nikon d100.  today, we had this a500 in the car when we stopped by the mall - our pics are great.  so if you have bad results its either YOU or you have faulty equipment - exchange it and get over it.<br /><br />about the Windows XP software - geez - who would use that crap anyway?  or any bundled software for that matter?  Adobe Photosop Album 2.0 is the bomb and its affordable - get this and you'll thank me, but don't complain about the giveaway software and pan the camera.<br /><br />have never heard about the e18 error, so can't talk about that.<br /><br />this camera is small, incredibly easy to use and takes great pics as well.  its also available at CostCo.","The Canon engineers have truly outdone themselves. I work for a high end photo retoucher, and my boss could not believe the S500's amazing image quality.<br /><br />Sleek yet solid, the Canon S500 is the perfect little gadget to wow everyone. I never cease to be amazed on how they fit a 3x optical zoom lens and a great, fast image processor into such a small package.  In fact, because the S500 is about the same size as an Ipod, it can fit into your shirt pocket or those neat Ipod clip cases.<br /><br />I highly recommend this wondrous camera to anyone who demands quality without compromising style.","I've had my S500 for about six months, and have used it extensively indoors, outdoors, and underwater.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />Size.  With any number of slim cases available, the S500 can be worn on your belt very comfortably.  It's not too heavy, and it's small enough that it doesn't get in the way much more than a cell phone, doesn't look like a fanny pack, etc.  If you're considering this camera, size is probably your number one concern, making this a great choice.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Pictures sometimes come out bright when using the flash.  The brightness isn't bad enough that your pictures won't turn out good, but it is slightly brighter than you might expect (I.e., if you're using another Canon or other digital brand already).  It also looks brighter on the LCD than it does when you view the pictures on a PC.<br /><br />MISC.<br /><br />- At max size and resolution, pictures may be over 3MB in size.  I use a (few) SanDisk 512MB CompactFlash cards (SDCFB-512-A10), which hold around 200 pictures a piece.<br /><br />- Battery life is decent, but you'll probably want a spare if you're going to be on the move all day.  The Canon Digital Elph Camera Accessory Kit includes a battery, mid-size carrying case (great for travel) and a slim belt case.  At ~$60, you can't beat it.<br /><br />- For underwater photography (also good for rain, skiing, etc.), the underwater housing (WP-DC800) works great.  I've taken several hundred underwater shots at a variety of depths (snorkeling and diving), and they come out very clear, with good light levels.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a high-quality, compact digital, I don't know that you can do much better.","I have bought this camera this year. It exceeded my expectations - picture quality is great. So is the size, because I can just put it into my pocket and take it everywhere. I have no problems with it at all. The only issue is the battery life - it is little short and I need to recharge more often than I would wish. I wish I could use the standard AA batteries instead.","This is my second Canon digital elph camera. Both were great cameras. Recently upgraded to the S500. About 6 months later I get the dreaded E18 error. I searched the Internet and found numerous people having problems. When I determined the problem to be the lens not fully extending I decided to give it a tug. It clicked and the camera came on, ready to take pictures. Turning it off and on produced the E18 again. While turning it on I gave it a nice little bump on the side (where the USB connector is) and the lens popped out on its own. No problems since.<br /><br />Its a nice compact and light camera and takes great photos and videos. Only complaint (other than E18) is the limit of 30-second videos on 640x480 mode. I've got a 512MB compact flash card, I should be able to take as much footage as I have memory in one take.","I'm happy with this purchase. Only issues are that there is a shutter delay that is longer than I expected.  Also, I had to search for and download drivers for Windows 2000 - this was not needed to immediately connect to Windows XP.","If you just need a digital camera to take pictures in the sun light, you can almost pick any digital camera.<br />But if you want your camera to take great pictures under all different light conditions (i.e. in door, with dark background, wedding photos and other complex light situations), then Canon S500 will be the only choice. Thanks to Canon DIGIC Image Processor and iSAPS Technology, this Canon S500 really takes perfect pictures in all different light conditions, which no compact digital camera from other vender can match.<br />However the Canon case for S500 is very dispointing, which is poorly made with cheap fake leather.<br />I found the most beautiful, perfect fitting leather case for Canon S410/S500 from [...]","I find the double zooming feature (optical/ digital) very useful and powerful.<br />The quality of the resulting pictures is fantastic.<br />I highly recommend this product.","Not all memory cards work well with all cameras. I tried to use a Viking card with my Canon s230, and got the E18 error mentioned here. As soon as I swapped my SanDisk back in, the problem was gone forever. I think sending the memory card back was a much better and cheaper solution than ditching an excellent camera.","I've always wanted to have photography as a hobby and I decided on this camera for my first one. Being a graphic artist I'm looking for some new material to work with. This camera is a good camera, but it does have its problems. It takes pictures at a maximum of 2592 by 1944 pixels, so size is never an issue. Just make sure you buy a 256 MB memory card if you plan on taking many pictures in one session. In daylight or normal light settings this camera works great. Sometimes if you're shooting something with strong light on it, the light will appear much brighter than you'd expect, but generally daytime pictures are sharp and vibrant. However, I just walked around my neighborhood at dusk, not dark, but the sun was out of the sky. I took roughly 200 pictures of various things (without the flash), and when I came home and transferred them to my computer they all appeared very dark, if I brightened the image all of the detail was there, but the image itself was unrecognizable at it's original quality. But if you're shooting a light source, the image will come out fine. I've taken some dead of night shots of lamp posts, and they came out very artistic with no loss of quality. The flash is only helpful at night if you're shooting close ups of objects, because beyond 10 feet the flash has no effect on your surroundings.<br />In normal light conditions the flash isn't required because the camera will take quality pictures.<br />Also, another review mentioned that his camera had a dead pixel, and so does mine, sadly. Fortunately I edit all of my pictures anyway and it's very easy to remove, but it's kind of annoying to have a single tiny white dot on every picture. I doubt it will happen to yours, but it did show up on mine.<br />You can view the photos I have taken with my S500 at [...] I'm giving this camera a 4/5 stars because despite its problems, it has still fulfilled all of my amateur photography needs.","Im 16, going to portugal for a year. Got this camera to take some photos before i leave, and while im there. Has great photo quality (printed some out at Walmart) I love the camera, holds a good charge. I lost the charger already (3 weeks) oops! but its a great charger. Many options on the camera. I love it!","Update: A year on the camera still works fine. It's still too slow for any sort of action shot and there's no way to put it into shutter priority so far as I can tell. As a belt camera I still haven't found anything better and it's showing very little sign of wear from being with me every day. Battery life is still very good. However, the slow reaction of the camera has driven me to buy an EOS-20D. I can't take it everywhere but it's way better for any form of action. Curiously some of my best scenic shots are still with the S500. Would I buy it again? Only if I couldn't get something the same size with shutter priority and faster reactions to the shutter release.<br /><br />After a couple of weeks of taking pictures and experimenting with settings I'd say this is good, great in many circumstances, but not perfect.<br /><br />Some of the issues are just limitations of the form factor, the form factor was the deciding point in my choice of cameras. Perhaps I had some unrealistic expectations of the ability of technology to overcome physics?<br /><br />Basically, with a 5M pixel sensor and a tiny little lens you don't get fast shutter speeds unless you either have excellent lighting or use the flash. Fortunately the flash is perhaps unexpectedly powerful, so most indoor shots can be well lit and fill-in can be used outdoors, though you seem to have to go to manual mode to force the flash to be used.<br /><br />The battery seems to last well even when using the flash. Some reviews say you need to use one battery while charging another. Well, I don't know what they were doing, I meant to change the battery yesterday morning and the camera is still going strong today, I think that's about 150 pictures since I last changed the battery for the spare. Batteries still have memory effect even though it is less pronounced than with NiCd technology of the past, the NiMH battery in the laptop I am using now has only half the capacity it should.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the camera. The metering system isn't clairvoyant, it does sometimes pick the wrong subject, especially in backlit conditions which is why I know about forcing it to use fill-in floash.<br /><br />Indoor shots without the flash will often be blurred, I took one just after landing in Chicago ORD and there was a lot of blurred motion on walking people though I had managed to hold the camera steady as the background was sharp. If you don't use the red-eye reduction mode on the flash you will get amazing red-eye.<br /><br />I use a 512Mb Sandisk Ultra II that I picked up for about $120, that gives me about 350 shots in fine mode. The speed of the card hasn't really been a noticeable benefit the way I have used the camera.<br /><br />The colors are good, I'm not certain they are great, I have a suspicion they are a little blue. Certainly blue scenes seem very blue.<br /><br />Speaking of blue... my old Olympus shows red flares to the right of bright edges, so a white light will have a red halo to the right. On a couple of shots the S500 has shown a blue halo to the left, one example was a person standing with their back to a very brightly lit window, even though he was correctly exposed. Perhaps fill-in flash would have fixed this, but that would have given some red-eye.<br /><br />In summary, this camera has shown me that there's no substitute for big pieces of glass even in the modern day, the lens is still the most important part of a camera. My old Olympus 3040z with an f1.8 lens was much more effective in low light... but I never had it with me when I wanted to take a picture \"right now\". The S500 in the small belt pouch with the 512Mb compact flash has proven sufficient for about 3 days of casual photography. However, if I want to take memorable and sharp scenic shots I'm going to have to bite the bullet and buy the EOS10D. I hear now that the S410 may have better low light performance, so perhaps I'll sell my S500 and try that instead.","I was shopping at Best Buy with my friend, who decided on the SD110, the smallest in the ELPH series.  However, after a little research, I found that the s500 is only marginally larger than its smaller sibling.  Even so, this marvel can slip into my front pocket easily and takes superb pictures.  The s500 also has the distinction of having 5 megapixels--fully 2 more than the SD110, and 1 more than the cheaper s410.  I'm thinking if I'm already going to be spending so much money ($500 with an additional battery pack), I might as well go all out for the best, or just stick to a cheap $200 camera.  Right?  And who wants to buy cheap electronics?  :-P<br />I also have the Canon A70 and the Sony Cybershot U40.  While the A70 was my trusty workhorse last year, it is rather homely and bulky.  While not *very* large, there would have been no way to slip that brick into my pocket, with it's protruding grip and lens.  Also it is only 3.2 megapixels.  From looking at the pictures I took today on the s500's \"shakedown\" around the neighborhood, I can already tell that it takes far more detailed, sharper images than the A70, which suffered from a minor \"softness\" in the pictures it took.  Also, the s500 is less a camera than it is a work of art in it of itself.  When off, the camera has a slim, elegant look.  It has an nostalgic air of Art Deco about it.  From the front, the highly polished silver and handsome gold rings around the lens will catch anybodys' eye immediately--a breathtakingly beautiful machine to take breathtakingly beautiful pictures.<br />On the other hand, this camera is not nearly as small as the Sony U40, which was about the size of my index and middle fingers put together.  However, that had no zoom and took only marginally acceptable images (2 MP and rather grainy)--I bought it primarily so I'd have a throwaround camera.  In any case, the s500 is not *as* small, but it still fits into my pocket without any hassle (you'll know it's there, but it won't bother you), and the optical zoom and high image quality more than make up for it.<br />Again, the image quality is superb, and all in such a portable package.<br />Manual controls are light.  There is AUTO, Manual, Panorama, and Video mode.  In Manual, you can control the ISO and F stops, but they are not readily available, and require fiddling with the menu to access.  I don't care, personally.  I bought the camera for it's portability and ease of use when I want to snap pictures.  I leave the wheel on AUTO and I am perfectly content with the images I get--for the average picture taker, too, I'd imagine.<br />The movie mode is decent.  This is a camera and not a camcorder, it's still part of the package, but I'll not put it into consideration when rating this camera.  Subpar.  My A70 could take 640x480s at 15 frames/second while the s500 only takes a sluggish 10.  It's is quite choppy, but bearable.  The s500 can have 15 frames a second under the two smaller video resolutions, but they still do not look as good as the videos I captured with my A70.  There is just an element of choppiness that I do not like.  Perhaps the increased megapixelage necessitates a decrease in smoothness, I don't know.  However, the movie mode is just an additional nicety in this otherwise superb piece of machinery, and it decent, acceptable, just not as good as I know it could be, for Canons, but I know this feature is important for many people considering digital cameras.<br />The proprietary battery is also something that I do not like (I prefer AAs) but I suppose there have to be some trade-offs--I'd suggest getting a spare, since it's theoretically supposed to last only about 2 hours per charge.  I'd also suggest getting the skin-tight leather cover for this cam, since you can still fit it in your pocket while keeping that lovely luster intact, away from the coarseness of your pockets.<br />I'd also suggest getting a CF that has as high a write speed as possible.  When taking pictures at maximum size(2592x1944) and maximum resolution (super-fine), my card took about 1-3 seconds to finish recording.  I could continue taking more pictures almost immediately afterward, but I would still have to wait for the images to finish writing before turning off the camera.  I did not notice this when I took superfine photos at the Medium size settings.  Speaking of CF, I'd also suggest getting as big a card as possible.  This monster takes pictures at 1-3 Mb each which means about 100-200 picture for me--my 256Mb card doesn't seem so adequate anymore.  But it's fine.<br />Conclusion.<br />So definately a great buy.  It takes wonderful, superb pictures, and decent movies.  By itself, it is a work of art, and truly is a handsome camera.  All this, and is still compact enough to throw in your pocket or for the ladies, purse.  There are slightly smaller and cheaper ELPHs, the sd110 and s410, but you will already be spending so much, and if you are, you might as well spring for the full 5 megapixel goodness that the s500 offers--3 megapixel cameras belong back in 2003.  And there are other brands to choose from, but I honestly have not seen a more handsome camera that takes such spectacular images, and I think if you are considering this camera at such a price, that surely, you will be considering the aesthetic value of what you are buying.  This camera is sure to please.","I just purchased the S500 as a second camera and addition to a Canon G1 that I have used for three years. The S500 is simple to operate, has extremely easy to use set up tables on the lcd, very solidly built, attractive, small and takes INCREDIBLE photos. I think I will retire the G1. I tested the camera out of the box for resolution, dead pixels, etc. It was flawless and the first photos blew everyone's socks off. A photo of a child from across the room was zoomed in to show individual freckles and eyelashes. The leaf veins on a nearby plant became clearly visible when zooming in the finished photo. Multiple indoor, outdoor, close and distant photos revealed the same resolution, clarity and detail. Note that on superfine, the camera does use nearly 2Mb memory per photo, but with a 256Mb CF I still get over 100 pictures between changing cards. I tried a Minolta and sent it back. I've used Nikons and Olympus digitals at our office. None offered the ease, clarity, size and feel of the Canon S500. I am VERY pleased.","I am a big fan of Canon cameras, so I might be a little biased.  But that doesn't mean I don't use cameras from other manufacturers.  I have found that Canon cameras, in this case the Powershot S500, are at the top of the camera market.<br />The design is terrific.  Canon really outdid themselves with the design of the Elph line of digitals.  It's good looking and compact, but still packed with all the features you need.  The one thing I really love about this camera is that it just feels solid in your hand.  It's a small camera, but some people are surprised at how solid it feels.<br />Included with this camera is a high speed 32mb compact flash card.  They're the first to include a card of this type and size which is great.  But if you're shooting at maximum resolution, you can really only take 11 pictures.  You'll need at least a 64mb card to get 24 pictures at maximum resolution.<br />The quality of the pictures and performance of the camera are very high.  I can't believe the amount of information that is captured at 5 megapixels.  The pictures are remarkably clear and vibrant.  The camera performs well in all conditions.  The low light assist lamp works well.  The only thing they could have included was an 'action' shot mode that trims down the shutter speed to capture fast moving objects or people.<br />The software you get with this camera is very good.  Easy to download pictures, great organization, and all the little features like stitch assist are great.<br />Overall an excellent camera.  If you're looking for a top of the line point and shoot, you'd find it hard to find a better camera than the Canon Powershot S500.","This camera is perfect for taking on outings with friends or going on vacation. Stick in your pocket and whip it out when you want to take a snap shop of your buddies acting silly. Only thing it lacks is the ability to manually focus your picture. When you point and shoot you don't want to spend time fiddling around with the manual focus, autofocus does an good job of giving you a crisp clear picture. Canon has done it again with the S500.","this camera is compact, easy to use, a tad bit thicker than the sd100, which has a darker gray sliverish surface. this camera has a lot of options/fuctions, the best part i think is the 640x480 video option. the 30 sec limit means about 18 mb videos un compressed. it's great quality. and the picture's \"smart focus\" is great.","I love this camera. I wanted a small camera that I could take everywhere with me. My first digital camera was a Nikon Coolpix 700 which did me great, but was bulky and difficult to tuck in my pocket. The s500 takes wonderful pictures and is so compact. I love the stich assistant feature which is on the included software- after a trip to the Grand Canyon it worked beautifully. As others have suggested, it id definately worth purchasing a larger capacity memory card if you intend to go on vacation with your camera as the 32MB included takes only 11 pictures at full size. I also use a close fitting case rather than one with lots of padding and pockets. I think using a bigger case defeats the object of having such a small camera in the first place. You can always put extra cards and batteries in your pocket/purse.<br />Overall this is a fantastic camera. It is portable, and takes great pictures. It looks great too!","If you are looking for a camera that has excellent picture quality, easy to operate, and compact enough to take everywhere - Canon's PowerShot S500 deliveres. This camera replaces my Sony DSCV1 Cyber-shot 5MP and left treadmarks on it. The S500 has better picture quality and is smaller. These are the qualities that I want in a compact, portable, point and shoot rig. If you want more features consider the new Canon Rebel (digital rig). Pound for pound this camera hangs with the best of them.","I'd been waiting for the five megapixel version of this camera to come out, but after a bit of research I have some advice; buy the four megapixel version instead.  Canon's been having problems putting five megapixels on such a small sensor like the ones used on the S50 and S500 (they use the same sensor).  Check out the online review at dcresource(dotcom).  Why buy a five megapixel when you get better image quality and smaller file sizes with the 4MP version of the same camera?  I ended up buying a brand spankin' new S45 on closeout from Amazon for 2/3 of what these sell for.<br />Let the members of the upgrade of the month club have their new toy, and be waiting to take their \"old\" camera off their hands, or buy a new one at a fire sale price.","Awesome compact size, nice images, great color, easy to use with excellent construction. In short the camera has a very high \"Coolness Factor\" and worth every penny. The only two thinga I would change would be to relocate the tripod socket to the center of the bottom plate. The camera is dense for it's size and with the \"center of gravity\" where it is, relative the tripod socket, restricts the camera's use in the vertical position when matched with a tiny tripod like the Sima ST-10T Mini Tripod with the tripod legs retracted. Get a slightly larger tripod (30-50% larger) and everything will be just fine. Second, the camera will let the user set exposure compensation in 1/3 EV increments, and set the type of lighting source, ie florescent, incandesces... but not in video mode.","The new Canon PowerShot S500 is a 5MP upgrade to the immensely popular S400 model, which was a 4MP digital camera.  The S500 produces excellent images, is easy to use, and is compact enough to carry in a pocket.  3X optical zoom is standard on these cameras.  Besides shooting still photos, you can record low-res video clips as well as audio clips, but don't expect high quality on either.<br />For a hundred bux less, you can get the 4MP S410 model which is otherwise identical to the S500.  Should you go for this or the S410?  I think for most consumers 4MP is plenty enough, with room for cropping and enlargements.  5MP is only necessary if you really crop a lot *and* plan to blow up the cropped images.  The S410 strikes a great balance between pixel count and price -- it's a better value.","This is my first digital camera, and I have no regrets.  It's a damn fine point-and-shoot with very intuitive controls and can be used virtually right out of the box (just charge the battery a bit). The video capture feature is just fine; afterall, if you wanted a video camera, you would have purchased one.  I considered the Sony DSC-T1, but with Sony's proprietary memory requirements, the cost/benefit just didn't add up.  The S500 is a sturdy camera, and should satisfy the casual photo enthusiast for quite some time.  The included software is also user-friendly and easy to use.<br />My Canon Elan 7E and Canon Elph 2 kept me content for quite some time. With hundreds if not thousands of dollars spent on photo-processing however, it was simply time to get into the digital age.<br />For accessories, you'll want to get a case for it (such as the PSC-50) as it only comes with a wrist strap.  In addition, consider purchasing a larger CF card (256MB or 512MB... I purchased the SanDisk Ultra II 256MB).  Once you buy a card, you'll be able to use it in digital SLRs if you go that route; the included 32MB card will quickly run out of space if you are taking full resolution photos.<br />Anyone interested in taking the leap into digital photography and wanting unbiased reviews should take a look at Steve's Digicams at [...]<br />Choosing a digital camera is very much a function of lifestyle.  If you are used to SLRs and like being able to bring multiple lenses for special photography opportunities, then consider the Digital Rebel or EOS 10D; you won't find better cameras on the market.  If however, you want a compact camera that you can easily take anywhere, consider the S500 as a happy travel partner to capture those moments, and never process film again!","I'm a big fan of Canon cameras.  I have an old AE-1 SLR, a point and shoot, and a Powershot S100.  I got the S500 mainly because of my past experience with Canon.  I'm not disapointed in the least.  I love my S100 because of the size.  I literally carried it with me everywhere I went.  Now with the S500 I do the same thing, and the pictures are so much better.  I just got my first set of pictures from Ofoto and they came out stunning.  The pictures are sharp, vivid, and balanced.  I love my S500.  I do think you should get a bigger memory card, because 32mb is barely enough for a handful of pictures.  However, the camera is top notch.  And the size makes it so much easier to deal with.  Your not giving up quality for size with this thing.","This is an outstanding camera, excellent enlargements, and very compact, not a hassle at all to take with you in any line of work or vacation.  Get a monster flash card, though, top line pictures fill up included 32MB memory card after 15-20 shots.","I exchanged my camera from Best-buy after finding the spot on the LCD the very next day.  Since then I have had the opportunity to take some pictures and I must say I am very happy results.  My wife took the camera for our daughters easter parade and the pictures are excellent.  Crisp clear picture of little kids doing their thing as they marched (or ambled is more like it) to the chapel.  Some people have said that Canon does not deliver true skin tones - for me that myth has be shot to bits!  My daughters class is ethnically and racially diverse and skin tones were delivered flawlessly.  Flash is quite effective.  I could not find any obvious flaws with it.  In fact I like to use the camera without flash to capture indoor shots and I was blown away by the results.  Of course, I was capturing inanimate objects. I like the manual setting options.  The camera allows you to set defaults for each mode (except auto) i.e. exposure, ISO etc.  Thats useful if you want more control over your shots.  It allows you to shoot in B&W also, which is great(and I<br />don't thing the P10 has this - I may be wrong.)  I also bought a 256mb flash Card - and I can get 99 pictures at 5mp.  Decreasing the size to 1600x1200 at Fine (instead of superfine) gives you approximately 420 images.  The flash card (SanDisk 256mb) cost only about $45 (it was on sale at best buy and I got 10% off of 4 Digital Camera accessories.)  What an awesome buy!<br />P.S: I tried to update my original review but my updates are not reflecting.  I","I own a 20D which I absolutely love and was getting tired of lugging it around and was therefore looking for a good digital point and shoot. My two major candidates were the S500 and the S70.<br /><br />If you follow the photography boards at all you realize that this is a fairly common dilemma - the S500 vs the S60/70. The S60/70 offers excellent manual controls while the S500 is significantly smaller without any manual control whatsoever other than exposure compensation. I just LOVE the look and feel of the S500 though if anything it could be argued that it is TOO small. If you feel it is and you are looking for a carry everywhere camera it is well worth the effort to get used to the small size because the camera takes beautiful pictures.<br /><br />The S500 is simply beautiful. I can live without all the manual controls since I own the 20D and since this camera is primarily for my wife and for me when I don't want to lug the 20D around.<br /><br />Several have pointed out that since this camera is so small it will always be with you whereas the S60/70 would be less likely to be carried along because of its increased size. This is a very good argument! The camera is SUBSTANTIALLY smaller than its bigger brother the S70. The form and size factors are what finally won me over.<br /><br />One criticism of the camera. Low light focusing is less than ideal. You need to work with the camera to understand its limitations indoors.  Also, battery life could be better, but that's the price you pay for such a small camera.<br /><br />The sensor size of the S500 is the same as that of the S60 and the S70 - 1/1.8\".  This is an ideal size for a point and shoot IMO.  The 1/2.5\" sensor used in the smaller SD series cameras represents a poor image quality trade off.  Stick with the larger sensor which give less noise, chromatic aberration, and better image quality.<br /><br />I purchased the leather Elph case which protects the camera well and only adds insubstantially to the bulk.  Some have complained that prior iterations of this camera scratch easily.  I've owned them and found that if you keep the camera in a case and exercise modest caution that the camera will remain pristine.<br /><br />The pictures are just fantastic!  Color saturation is superb and the file size is sufficient that you can crop moderately with little negative impact.  Other than in low light the camera locks onto its subject quickly and accurately.<br /><br />One other consideration:  The S700 will undoubtedly be hitting the streets soon.  It will employ the larger Sony sensor used by the S70 which gives fantastic results.  It might be worth your while waiting.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of the Canon cameras and I would advise anyone looking for a camera, whether a point and shoot or a DSLR to carefully consider the Canon line since, in my opinion, Canon currently represents the state of the art.","So after exhaustive research and countless hours of trials at Circuit City, Best-buy and Penn Camera we decided the best way to capture those candid moments of our 3 yr old daughter was with the PowerShot S500.  We decided to buy the camera from Best-buy for $499.00 and bought their extended 4yr warranty along with it for an additional $79 (because it is sooo small and also because I had read about the E18 errors of the S100.)<br />We chose the camera mainly because it was the only one that actually gave us clear pictures of our daughter who barely sits still.  A side-by-side comparison with the DSC-P10, P92, P72 etc put the Sonys to shame.  None of them - could give sharp pictures of moving objects.  The Nikon CoolPix 5700 was good but a tad over budget.  We did have to use the Quick Shot mode to get the sharp pictures but even without quick shot it consistently gave us good pictures (all these tests were done using the floor models at the 3 stores.)  The sales men at the Penn Camera were the best informed and the staff at Circuit City was the worst.  The staff at Best-Buy was clueless but very helpful - spending almost an hour with me obliging by supplying me with the necessary memory cards etc. on each visit.  The most helpful was my daughter who obliged me by never sitting still so I could do a true side by side comparison.<br />Huge disappointment when we got the camera home.  The moment it was fired up in my comparatively poorly lit home(as compared to Best Buy) I noticed a light blue dot on the right side of the LCD (just sightly of dead center.)  It would show up very clearly when I focused on any dark object.  The same dot didn't show on my Sony Vega, or when I played back the images.  Took it back to Best Buy less then 24 hours purchasing it.  First they refused to see the dot.  Then they agreed it was there and admitted it was a problem with the Lens and was even showing up on prints and that others had complained about it.  Apparently even the first floor model had the same problem.  Canon is aware of it and has fixed it on the newer ones.  What bugs me is that even though they were aware of the problem they didn't do a recall and Best Buy didn't bother to test the Camera before selling it.  They don't have any more in stock but a branch 20 miles from here has ONE but they can put it on hold for us to go and pick up.  I called the store and found out they have 5 in stock.  Now I am going to pick 1 from there but of course I will be testing it before I bring it home.  I'm going to keep it as I have the 4 year warranty from BB.  Looks like I may need it.<br />Update:  Got the camera exchanged.  Have been toying with it since and am amazed with the picture quality.  I had read some reviews of Canon cameras not showing correct skin tones - I must say this camera has no such problems.  I took the camera to my daughters school and took pictures of her easter parade and all the pictures came out beautifully.  Her class is a multi-ethnic class and I can say with 100% certainty - skin tones are not an issue!  I would have liked to link to my pictures but am afraid I cannot do so without permission from the rest of her class.  Awesome Camera!  Only 4 stars because of the problem with the first camera I got.","Canon has got itself a real winner with this one.The S500 is a very comprehensive point and shoot.Quality construction,ease of use,asthetically pleasing and good value.Pictures come out sharp and vibrant.The movie mode could be a little better(compared to the new Sony DSC T-1 which can take video at 30fps,just like you would see on a DVD)but that's a small complaint.<br />  All the new cameras coming out in May04 from just about all the manufacturers will have a high-res movie mode,so you might want to wait if you want to take video with your cam as well.<br />  Back to the Canon.I highly recommend this camera.Of course you will want to upgrade the included flash memory of 32MB which is just not enough.Also get some sort of carrying case,this camera is too expensive to let it get knicked or bumped.I found another site that has great articles on digital cameras:[...] Check them out for a second opinion.<br />Enjoy","Canon have done it again and produced this year another great ultracompact camera. The Powershot S500 really hits the mark for me. Small, and well designed it is also a well-rounded performer in the digital camera world. At 5 megapixel resolutions you can take very good quality pictures. The camera itself is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. It comes with 32 MB compact flash, so you may well want to upgrade this capacity. Also, a case is not supplied in the box. Still these are small minuses. Like a lot of the newer ultracompact digital cameras the S500 has a movie mode, and can capture 2-3 minutes. Outdoors it takes some very nice pictures, but I was actually pleasantly surprised by its indoor performance with flash. It is possible to take some good photos without red eye problems. You cannot really go wrong with this camera if you want a good high performance compact."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot SD110 (Digital IXUS IIs / IXY Digital 30a)","amazon_reviews":["This is a great, compact camera for the non-professional photographer who values high quality photos.

Yes, they do promise a 10 day delivery by standard mail but what is not said is that the clock starts only after they process the order.  So if it takes them one wk to process the order you're now looking at a 3 wk delivery date from the time you hit \"ENTER\" and place your order.<br />To make matters worse the UPS delivery date was delayed so it took 5 wks to get the camera.  This was not the fault of the company but their s  l  o  w processing added to the problem.<br />In fairness, they did offer to send me extra goodies for my inconvenience and they were response to my emails.","It's a decent camera for the time it was made, but if you don't take a picture with the flash, or on the surface of the sun, it will not have enough light and will be blurry.  I need to find one with more resolution and more sensitivity in normal light conditions.","After 3 years of using this camera for backpacking in Europe, and living in Spain and going all over the world, plus using it for taking photos for my business website, I can say that this camera has been one of the best that I have had. Its time to buy a new one, but if 3 MP its enough for you and you would use it for traveling this is a great choice!","I have used this camera now for over 2 years and have literally taken thousands of pictures. This camera combines excellent quality, small size, ease of use and affordability into one fine product.<br /><br />Picture quality is great. Very intuitive. I skimmed the instructions for about 2 seconds and started taking pics. The Canon photo software is very good. I alternate between using it and Microsoft Picture software.<br /><br />One thing I find really enjoyable is the movie mode. I assumed it would be horrible, but you get decent video and audio. With my 1gig card, I get about 3 minutes, which is plenty for shooting your pets doing something priceless or to document something. I have a Camcorder, but who wants to lug that around when this fits into your shirt pocket, or attaches to your belt using the optional leather case?<br /><br />Two years of reliable use, having been dropped a few times in the process. The rechargable battery still holds a good charge, and generic replacements are readily available on a popular auction site for next to nothing. The 1 gig SD card I use was literally free at one of the electronic big box guys over the holidays, and holds tons of photos. In practice, I usually downloaded 10-20 at a time just for ease of managemnt, so even my previous 256k card was more than enough.<br /><br />Size was a big factor in my decision to purchase. Smaller is better when you have a lot of other things to lug around. This stows easily in a pocket of my laptop carrying case, or as I said earlier, in a pocket. My previous camera was too big and I found I used it a lot less for that reason.<br /><br />2007 UPDATE: LCD/Sensor failed. I did some research and discovered that Canon was fixing this for free REGARDLESS of warranty expiration date. I sent it to them with the form from their website, and had my camera back and working perfectly about 10 days later! Thanks, Canon, for standing behind your product!","I honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars. The moment I got it, I was delighted with the quality of the pictures (except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star), and by its portability.<br /><br />I've dropped it, abused it, took it to countless parties, countries and it is now FULL of scratches and bumps (GET THE CAMERA CASE!), and guess what: it still works as perfectly as the first day I got it. This little piece of technology is amazing, so if you're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality (for us amateurs, of course) just go for it. ACtually, I even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it. I even love it and rely on it so much that I won't change it even now that it looks all messed up.<br /><br />Don't think twice. Just go for it.","I've had this camera for almost 3 years now, and I'm getting \"Memory card error\"'s. It's out of warranty, and Canon wants 200$ to fix it. There's no way to fix it either. Useless","I am happy with this camera; however, I would point out a couple of things that might make this a deal-breaker for some:<br /><br />1.  I like the date on the front of my photographs.  This is only possible w/ this camera if you print your photos at home or use the software to manually add the date on each individual photo.  Then you have to save your changes.  I have my photos printed at wal-mart, so this is a huge pain.<br /><br />2.  The ZoomBrowser software that comes w/ the camera is not too exciting.<br /><br />I think the camera is overall good, but I can't believe they dropped the ball when it comes to the date function.","I bought this camera for my daughter about a year ago. We did quite a lot of research before making our minds up. She wanted a  small camera that would be easy to use, that had a digital LCD screen, optical zoom, some manual features, and of course, that would take good pictures. But, needless to say, and specially being for a girl, good looks ARE important. Cosmetic appearence is one of the most important features of this little modern digital cameras.<br /><br />Well, this beautiful little camera had it all, and besides that, it is a Canon! Good camera guarantee!<br /><br />The camera does work well, it takes good, clear pictures, specially in good lighting conditions, like most of the digital cameras in this price range. It does offer different creative possibilities given it has some manual control options. It is very small and fits in your shirt pocket or a small purse. No complaints in its overall performance.<br /><br />My daughter was really pleased with her new camera and very proud of its good looks, which were complimented by her family and friends.<br /><br />But this did'nt last long. Less than a month after we bought it, dark spots began to appear everywhere in the camera body. My daughter was afraid that she was keeping the camera in the wrong place (she keeps it in a dry drawer inside a leather Canon soft case), or miscaring for it in someway. The spots began to grow more all over the camera day by day. So I wrote to Amazon and they said I had to direct my inquiry to the manufacturer, which I did'nt knowing this would'nt solve anything.<br /><br />Later I found out, by reading other costumers' reviews, that what really happens is that the finish in the camera shell rubs off. I  just read that this also happens to the SD100. So, beware. If you are into buying any Canon of the Digital Elph series, check thorougly and see if there are no complaints in that sense. Costumer reviews at Amazon are very useful for this research. These Canons are very beautiful and more expensive than the Canon \"A\" series. This is because of their smaller size and metal (not plastic) outer shell. This means you are paying more for cosmetic features that are going to wash off later!!<br /><br />We decided to keep the camera and try to sell it at some cheap price and buy another one. But we have'nt been able to sell it because everybody says it looks like it's 50 years old. Well, I have SLR cameras, that belonged to my dad, which are 50 years old or more, and they don't look remotely like this one. Like another reviewer very appropiately said: \"It looks like I've been through war with it\". It is embarassing to offer it for sale. It looks as  if it was washed with paint remover or some kind of acid.<br /><br />One reviewer said: \"That does'nt matter much to me\". Lucky him. It does very much matter to me. And I think to most of the people who are paying good money (not cheap either) for this \"little jewel\" that at the end comes to be a big dissappointment.","This camera is pretty good, it's very fast, the photo quality is excellent, video recording mode is awesome, and is perfect to carry everywhere since it's pretty small, but after several months of normal use, the metal case begins to look pretty rusted, that's why i dont give this camera a 5 star rating.<br /><br />But check the flickr photos, you will see examples of the great photo quality of the camera.","I bought this camera summer of 2005 when I was working in London after my old camera died (completely) while I was in Rome. Overall, I really haven't had any problems with the camera that I wouldn't expect from a less than $200 camera.<br /><br />The paint is very worn and looks likes I've been through war with it but the picture quality hasn't changed. As with any point and shoot, don't expect museum quality prints. Beware of low light situations. Even if you think the lighting is pretty good, my camera always wants to use the flash so when I turn it off, half the time the shots come out blurry. Also, randomly the shots would come off blurry in perfect conditions. Only happened a two-three times now, but very disappointing because of that.<br /><br />On the feature side, it's not too shabby. The Manual Mode is OK, but the highest ISO is only 400.<br /><br />I would recommend this with reservations. I run a small printing company so we have digital SLR's I take sometime so when comparing them it is night and day. Go for the SLR if you can, but this isn't bad either, especially if you are on budget. I got a 512 card and I highly recommend it! Also, the battery holds a pretty good charge so that is perk.","I just finished a semester in Brisbane, Australia. I must say, in retrospect, the best thing I took with me on this trip was this camera. She is a champ, definitely an adventurous camera. The thing is cute as hell yet solid like a rock. I cannot remember the amount of times I dropped it in the sand, with no negative consequences whatsoever. I even dipped it in the ocean by mistake once (not encouraged) and the thing still works like a charm.<br /><br />It also has features like Sepia and a weird flash that makes lights do something funny, making the pictures wicked cool.<br /><br />The outer covering has shown wear, but it only helps to acknowledge that this camera can take rough handling. People even comment on this on a positive light, it has become a part of my travelling gear.<br /><br />It is also great for scenic shots, and has the panorama option.<br /><br />In retrospect, it was an amazing buy, and so affordable (I'm on a backpackers' budget)!<br /><br />Only because I have seen amazing skies and breathtaking scenery would I consider upgrading to a camera with better pixelage. But if you are staying in hole-in-the-wall hostels or sleeping on the beach, you don't want to have an expensive camera on you.<br /><br />This thing is great. The battery life is also great (for the sake of topping off the cake).","The picture quality from this camera is great. It is sharp and clear. But, I have been disapointed by a couple of things.<br /><br />A) The LCD screen is very small and dark and it is hard to tell the quality of the picture you have taken until it is actually on the computer.<br /><br />B) The flash is so bright that if you take any kind of close up of someone they turn out all washed out in the picture. When I use the manual function and turn off the flash, it is hard to get a clear picture even if there is enough lighting. For some reason the pictures turn out blurry most of the time.<br /><br />C) The picture speed is VERY, VERY slow. I tried to take pictures of my 6 year old sledding with no luck. It was so slow and delayed that even if she was going slow, I would end up with a picture of just the snow.<br /><br />Other than those things, which are pretty important to me, the camera takes nice pictures as long as the object is not moving and is far enough away so that it doesn't get washed out by the flash.","Its exactly the same size as a pack of cigs. Perfect for carrying in your pocket for nights out and activities which would make you leave your larger SLR at home. Quality of pics is more than good enough and the size/quality is easily customizable. For the price its everything you could hope for in a camera, and you'd need to be a really good photographer to make a more expensive model worth the outlay.","I have owned my Canon SD 110 for a little over a year.  I immediately bought a 1GB memory card and 2 extra battery packs and took it to Europe.  I keep the camera set to maximum resolution and the memory card will let me take over 600 pictures and many 3 minute long movies.  I had been a die-hard traditional 35 mm camera user so that I had the ability to manually focus, but I have never looked back since buying this camera.<br /><br />I use it with iPhoto on my iMac and I put together great slide shows to music to show other people.  The photos look great on the computer.  I don't print often, but when I do, the photos look great too.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the silver finish started coming off right away.  I got such a great price on the camera, that it doesn't matter that much to me.  I also got a cute little Coach case with it and keep it in it pretty much all the time.","I purchased this as a secondary camera to carry in my purse or briefcase.  My first camera is a Canon EOS 10D and since my printers are all Canon I figured this would be a good compliment to my existing hardware.  For the price it's a great compact unit.  Controls are easy to use, read and I can confidentally give it my nephews or strangers and now that they all they need to do is aim and press the button for a decent shot.  Battery life has been good and I've yet to run out of battery before I ran out of shooting time.<br /><br />The not-so-good things:  it's so small that larger hands (mine are small) might have problems with the controls, there is a small delay between pushing the button and the shutter action.  This means that action shots will be blurry and you'll need to anticipate if your subject is moving.  I had heard from others that this is common in lower priced cameras and was a bit disappointed to see the blurry results especially with babies who are in constant motion.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great value for the price but be aware of its shortcomings.","Good camera of year 2005, took excellent pictures.

If this occurs, the signal is not output from the CCD normally in Shooting Mode, which may cause a distorted image or the absence of an image. This malfunction can be confirmed on the LCD monitor screen during shooting. The same malfunction also appears on the recorded image.<br /><br />Canon's Response:<br />Effective immediately, and regardless of warranty status, Canon will repair, free of charge, the products listed above exhibiting the above-mentioned malfunction if Canon determines that the malfunction is caused by the CCD image sensor. Canon will also cover the cost of shipping and handling in connection with this repair.<br />----<br /><br />My old review...<br />I gave Canon PowerShot SD110 camera to my girlfriend as a gift on her birthday. After looking at the quality of the pictures she has taken using this camera, I bought one for myself ;) No need to say she liked it for its look and everything.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />  - Ultracompact and Unisex Style (fits in purse or shirt pocket)<br />  - 3.2Mega-Pixel provides you the best quality pictures upto 8x10\" size pictures on photo paper.<br />  - Uses Secure Digital Memory card (SD card), which is very small in size. Unlike sony's memory-stick(R), SD cards are manufactured by many, hence price cut everyday. 128MB card may hold 80 or more pictures at a time. Go for 256MB or 512MB SD cards if you need more pictures to be taken before transfering them to a CD or to your computer.<br />  - Takes movies with sound. Handy on special events and easy to transfer to computer and email it.<br />  - Rechargable battery and the charge lasts longer too. \"AA\" batteries can not be used with this camera. Rechagable battery usually degrades after a year or two or more. But you don't have to spend any money on batteries until that time.<br />  - 2x optical zoom is good enough for most of the purposes. This camera is not for people who carry a tripod with them.<br />  - Digital zoom: Turn them off. You can have digitally zoom any picture using computer software. More digital zoom means less picture details/quality.<br />  - DIGIC Imaging processor?!! Duh! scary words? All it means is that this camera has used new technology to make it smart, fast and high performance camera.<br />  - Value for money.<br />  - Highly recommended for those who is looking for a point & shoot type digital camera that gives good quality regular size pictures.","This camera is great and easy to use. It totally changed my experience in taking pictures to a whole new level. A could take pictures of almost anything and not worry about wasting film.<br /><br />A totally great buy.","I really can't say enough about this little camera.  I've had a bunch of different digicams -- from a high-powered Olympus to a compact Fuji to a larger Canon -- and none add up to the quality and convenience of the SD110.  For less than $200, I got a 3 megapixel camera that shoots beautiful shots.  The added bonus?  Its size.  It has a rectangular shape, different from many cameras which have odd parts that stick out.  In this respect, it's perfect for traveling as it can easily fit in your pocket or tote bag.  About the only drawback is its minimal 2X optical zoom, but if you're traveling, how often do you need a high powered zoom, anyway?","I bought this camera to supplement a larger and more capable digital camera (a Minolta Z2).  The SD110 fits easily in a pocket, so I find I take it with me much of the time.  At first I took it using the theory that ANY camera you have with you when you need one is better than the finest camera you don't have with you.  But the image quality turned out to be so good that I now use this camera more than the Minolta.  In side-by-side comparisons of 8x10 prints from the two cameras you can't tell which one took any given picture (though the SD110 is 3 megapixels and the Z2 is 4 megapixels).  Both produce very good results.<br /><br />The video capability is impressive -- 640x480 pixels at 30 fps, with sound.  That used to be available only in larger and more expensive cameras.<br /><br />Be aware of the limitations before you buy:  only a 2X optical zoom, and a flash of somewhat limited strength.  If you need significantly more zoom or flash, you will be happier with something else (though it may be bigger and will certainly be more expensive).  The SD110 offers a nice combination of price, image quality, and pocketable size.","I don't think you can buy a better digital camera for the price. I own Nikon SLRs (world's best optics), and I think this little camera has clarity very near that of my Nikons. It functions well in difficult lighting situations, has a sufficent flash and a nice-sized screen for photo viewing. My only complaints are the battery life and the size of the included memory card (16MB). The camera's small size makes it a good tag-along accessory and with the Coach case you can buy separately, it's pretty darn stylish. You can buy cameras with better resolution and a bigger zoom, but certainly not at this price.","I got this camera as a gift, and I must say I'm very, very happy with it.  It takes wonderful images -- especially for a 3.2MP (which is quickly becoming bottom of the line).  I keep a Flickr album that is populated exclusively with images from this camera, and you are welcome to see them here: [[...]<br /><br />The unit is a very convenient palm-size style that's easy to tote around in one hand, and the battery has pretty good power.  I can take 120-150 pictures (depending on the flash) before it dies on me and requires recharging.<br /><br />If I were forced to make a complaint or two, it would be that (a). this does not come with a case and (b). the zoom isn't very powerful.  It's all but useless except for the macro mode and for helping frame shots,  but all in all, this is a superlative model for an amateur photographer.","The Canon SD110 is perfect for your camera needs. It's compact, takes great quality pictures, and looks nice. The zoom could have been better, but you can live with it.<br /><br />Pros.<br /><br />Compact<br /><br />Takes great quality pictures<br /><br />Video is nice<br /><br />Looks nice<br /><br />Cons. [Don't really care about these]<br /><br />Flash is a little harsh<br /><br />Takes time to take a photo<br /><br />Zoom isn't good<br /><br />Picture quality: 8.0/10<br /><br />Size: 8.9/10<br /><br />Looks: 9.0/10<br /><br />Overall: 8.8/10","I JUST RECENTLY BOUGHT THE CANON POWERSHOT SD110...IT IS A WONDERFUL CAMERA.  IT IS SO COMPACT, IT COULD FIT IN MY BACK POCKET.  I DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LUGGING MY BIG CAMERA AROUND ANYMORE.  IT HAS A VIDEO CAMERA ALSO!<br /><br />I WILL CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND THE POWERSHOT SD110!","The Canon SD110 has exceeded my expectations.  I needed a simple point and shoot camera, and it offers just that.  It offers a variety of functions that are easy to use, and make for much more interesting pictures.<br /><br />Great Camera.  I highly recommend for the person who needs a simple.  Great battery life and software for the computer.<br /><br />Some drawbacks are...<br /><br />... delayed shoot time, takes a second to actually take a picture, and shutter speed can only be set at 50, no faster.<br /><br />... blurred pictures when not using flash.  This is self explanatory, but other cameras adjust shutter speed to take faster so the shot doesn't blur, the SD 110 doesn't seem to do that.","I got this camera around christmas time because it was at a really low price on amazon. I love it to death! It is the best digital camera I have owned ever. It takes great dark room shots without the flash and the color and quality of the pictures is great. I love how you can set it up to take black and white pictures as well as sepia and some others. The zoom is pretty amazing, and the size of the camera is great to just throw in your purse and take it everywhere you go! I'd also recommend getting a small case for it, for protection. :)","Purchased this camera in January and have used it nonstop ever since!  I did a lot of research before choosing this camera.  Canon and Nikon are consistently the best digital cameras, however I find Canon cameras are more user friendly, especially for the amateur user.  The automatic settings produce great pictures, the battery life is surprisingly good, and picture quality is as good as if not better than 35mm.  My only two complaints would be that the SD Card is a little slow as memory cards go, and the flash on this camera is quite powerful and can produce some glare, but in such cases, turning the flash off is easy and still produces great pictures!  If you are looking for a good quality, reliable camera at a value price, this is your best bet!","After owning several 35mm's in my life and several point and shoot cameras, I just wanted an easy to use, takes good pictures, digital camera - and one that was compact. This camera fit the bill better than I ever imagined it would. I LOVE the battery life with this camera, it lasts and lasts. I love the quick response (oh those pets and grandkids) and I get great (not good) pictures.  I have recommended Canon's Elph to two other friends; they bought them and they love them; and I'm buying one for a daughter's  b-day gift.  I bought the little leather case - ok, so it's CUTE, but this little camera goes in my purse with me everywhere. I am so past big bulky cameras - I LOVE this camera.  My husband (I'd never seen him use a camera in 17 year of marriage) got a 45 second \"here's how to use it\" lesson on the way to the airport for a business trip to Tokyo and Seoul. HE took great pics and videos. I was amazed. I waited a long time to buy a digital camera, I did a lot of research, and I got the right one. I take adult people pics, grandkid pics, pet pics, work pics, scenery pics - have a spectacular picture of Mt St Helens from inside a plane.  This is one versitile little camera.  Canon should pay me for my tesitmonials - I am such a convert! I'll never own any other kind of camera again. From a non-technichal, everyday users's \"value\" perspective, this is a good - no, great camera and a great buy. I am so enjoying my digital camera experience.","I love the convience and quality of the photos so far. Battery life is fine and the video quality is great. Very easy to point and shoot, ut is a little slow during between pictures.<br /><br />This is and overall great value however I wish the zoom were a bit etter","Now that this camera is on sale for $160, it is by far the best deal available right now. It takes amazing pictures, is easy to use and is very conveniently sized. The newer model which replaces it boasts a 1/2\" bigger lcd screen and 3x optical zoom instead of 2x. It also costs $300 for these 2 extra features. Take advantage of this great deal while it lasts!","If you're looking for a ultra-compact camera that you can carry around with you everywhere, than this is your camera.<br /><br />It's the smallest camera with optical zoom in the market.<br /><br />It's also very light weight but yet so strong built.....plus it looks great but most importantly, it takes GREAT pictures.<br /><br />LCD is bright & big enough for most people.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with the Canon PowerShot SD110.","This is a great little camera.  It is my first digital, and I love it!  I was a little worried about buying it after reading some of the reviews, but I have had no problems with it so far.  I have even dropped it twice (bad me!) but it still works great.  The first time I dropped it the battery pack came loose, so it didn't turn on until I figured that out.  Small moment of panic!  The photos are quite good depending on the settings you choose.  I first went for the smallest size and compression (640x480 and Normal which allows for 126 pictures with the included 16MB SD card), but found the pictures a little blurry on my PC.  Right now my camera is set on Fine compression and small size (which allows for 80 pictures) and I find that the resolution on my PC is clearer.  The camera easy to use, and the manuel is pretty straightforward.  The best part is that I didn't even need to install anything on my computer to download the pictures from the camera since Windows XP does that automatically.  I just plug in the cables and off we go.  Also, it is nice and small so it can fit in a purse or pocket no problem.  But I recommend getting a case for it.  It is a little heavier than I expected, but not ridiculously so.  Also, you have to hold the power button down for a few seconds for the camera to turn on.  The price is definitely attractive!  It is a $400 camera for less than half!  Don't hesitate.  If you are considering buying a digital camera, you won't be disappointed with the SD110.","I got this camera a couple weeks ago to find out every picture I took had a red dot in it.  I think it's due to a dead pixel.  I sent it back only to receive another one with the same problem.  Now I'm just getting a refund for it.  The red dot only comes out on darker pictures and it can be photoshopped easily.<br /><br />The overall quality of this camera is excellent.  The colors are very vibrant.  It has a strong sturdy feel to it.  The battery life is great compared to my last camera.  The flash is too bright though, almost blinding.  If it wasn't for the dead pixel and the flash this camera would be perfect.","I was amazed at the features in this camera for this very low price. The pictures come out flawless even low resolutions. There are so many variables which you can adjust for taking that perfect photo. While it is very easy to use for the novice photographer, it is still going to take a year to go through the manual because of the endless features integrated into this unit. Canon gets an A+ for this one!","My friend told me to buy this item and I have to agree this is a great digital camera. Great price too.","This camera is awesome.  A lot of bang for the price.  This little beauty is just slightly larger than my cell phone, and since I don't like to carry large purses, it fits neatly in mine.  The pictures are beautiful, I had no problem with the included software, and compared to my old camera (4 years old, RIP) it downloads it's pictures in a snap instead of an hour.  I was a little confused by the camera's functions and menus, but that is because I never read instructions, so my shortcoming, not the camera's.  I definitely recommend this sweet little camera with the big roar!","You get what you pay for in this case you get a small camera for little money that works great, for the purpose intended.  I bought this camera for my wife who has a fear of anything digital.  The camera is easy to use and takes good pictures.  The 3.2 MP is enough for most people (who needs a 2' x 3' picture).  The 2x zoom is a little weak, if you want more spend an extra $100+, I don't think the difference between 2x and 3x is worth it (my camera has 10x )  We use this camera mostly inside parties etc where you don't need a long lens. This camera is definitly worth the price, I would recommend getting a larger SD card right away (128?).","This is a great camera at twice the price. But at this discount, it's unbelievable. I'd been wanting to buy a Canon Digital Elph for a while now to replace my 2MP Fuji, and I'm glad I waited and got this one! Great auto mode for those shooters who want simplicity, and also versatile manual features for photogs who need more control. The best part is how compact and sturdy it is, so you can take it with you everywhere, everyday, because you just never know when a good photo op may present itself. I can't even say how often I found myself camera-less when I saw a potentially great picture op in front of me because I never liked carrying around my old digicam. But now, with the SD110 strapped to my belt or in my backpack, I'm ready to shoot at a moment's notice. Piece of advice on a carrying case: Do NOT buy the leather sheath offered, it sucks. Instead I bought a $15 Lowepro case at Best Buy specifically designed for the Digital Elphs... The camera fits just right, and the case has a pocket for an extra battery or SD card. Enjoy!","I've had this camera for about a month, and I carry it with me everywhere. My purpose for buying it was so that I could always keep a small camera clipped to my belt to take pictures of the many \"cute\" moments my toddler spontaneously created. In doing this, I have found that this camera can take great pictures.<br /><br />Keep in mind that any piece of technology is meant to meet a fairly narrow set of needs, but for me this camera is perfect. I don't print snapshots at a size larger than 5 by 7; I don't expect people who look at them to pore over them with a magnifying glass; I am not at all interested in using this camera for professional purposes; and I am by no means a professional photographer.<br /><br />That said, let me tell you what I love about this camera: It is extremely well-built, and is far more substantial than you would expect given its diminuative size. It has a good battery that will easily last you through even a long vacation without needing to be recharged. It is so portable that I need never be without it; this is a huge plus, considering that I am mostly interested in candid shots of my family and friends. The controls are intuitive and easy to understand. It comes with a great manual that explains everything. I have generally found this to be the case with Canon's products, and this camera is no exception.<br /><br />Well, what's wrong with it? It should be taken as a given that the memory cards that come with these cameras are useless. I knew this up front, and bought a 256 meg card that says it will hold 270 pictures at max resolution (nice). The 2x optical zoom is limiting, but it suits my purposes fine. If you really feel like you need more than this, you'll pay a lot more for it in a camera of this quality. About 1 in 3 portrait shots has some red-eye, even with the red-eye reduction flash on. This tends to be a pretty standard complaint for tiny cameras, so I view it as a trade-off for its portability.<br /><br />This one will likely be discontinued as soon as they sell out of their present stock, so if you think it meets your needs then by all means buy it. It's a great little point and shoot camera.","The Negative:<br /><br />I liked the camera's user-friendliness and the quality of the photos. However, I only got to use the camera for a total of about 45 minutes.  Toward the end of it's life it just shut off by itself. I turned it right back on and just a few minutes later it DIED altogether, leaving the lense open. I tried everything to revive it, including fully recharging the battery but to no avail.<br /><br />It appears I got a camera with the same defect as \"BigDaddyWill\" (his review was on January 9, 2005). Maybe I should have heeded the warning...<br /><br />The Positive:<br /><br />I got a GREAT price on the camera and purchase of the camera made me eligible for a $70.00 rebate on a Canon printer!<br /><br />Amazon's staff were great!. They took my call, heard my story and now my free replacement is on the way (should be here in 4 days), and it looks like the process for returning my defective camera will be a breeze.<br /><br />I trust I have better luck with the next one.","I just got this camera, and I am astounded that something this small could take such great pictures.  After reading countless reviews for various cameras (only seriously considering Canon), I came to the conclusion that the most important feature was portability.  What good is a camera that's too clunky to take with you?  And the SD-110 is about as small as digital cameras get.  It is also very easy to use, I have yet to read the documentation, and this was my first digital camera.  We were just looking for a simple snapshot camera, and this is perfect for us.  And the low price makes this a true bargain, especially for a quality Canon camera.<br /><br />In my case, I took advantage of the $70 rebate and picked up a Canon PIXMA IP3000 photo printer.  I already had an HP printer that could do photos, but after the rebate the Canon printer was around $25... the ink is worth more than that, so the printer was basically free.  I decided to get it as a dedicated photo printer, printing directly from the camera without constantly downloading photos to my PC.  It's extremely easy this way, and I don't have to swap cables or change paper (I just leave photo paper loaded all the time).  And the print quality is perfect, far better than I expected from a free printer.  Another plus: ink for Canon printers is much cheaper than HP ink.<br /><br />So with the photo printer, a case, and a Kingston 256MB memory card, the grand total for the purchase (after the rebate) was a little over $200.  That's a deal that's pretty hard to beat.","I just love this camera!  It's small, easy to use, and it takes fantastic pictures.  At the price amazon is offering it, you literally can't afford NOT to buy it.  I have friends with similar versions of this camera and they swear by it as well.<br /><br />Memory cards are really cheap right now-I personally bought a 128mb, which in my opinion is plenty (will hold over 100 pictures.)  I also bought the leather case and it fits the camera snugly.  Others have complained that it's TOO small because it won't hold anything else (extra cards, batteries, etc.) but why purchase a small camera if you're going to carry it around in a giant bag with a bunch of stuff?  This case is good to have to protect it from being damaged in whatever bag/pocket you carry the camera around in...and it too is cheap.","After years of SLR use my first Digital Camera was a Canon G2.  Took tons of great and numerous not so great pictures.  My complaint was the tendency of digital photographs not being \"smooth\" (dont know what the technical term is but objects running diagonal in the pictures occasionally/frequently being jagged).  My, as it turns out, uninformed conclusion was that it had something to do with resolution (pixels).  When 8 megapixels hit the market, I coughed up the serious dough to buy the Olympus C-8080.  The quality of the good pictures improved but but the number of out of focus or bad pictures increased.  Yes, yes, I am not motivated enough to read all the materials on digital photography and use the knowledge to decipher the users manuals! (read lazy)<br /><br />I needed a simple and small camera for my work, saw a great deal (under $150) for SD110, ordered and got it a couple of weeks back.  The results are an eye opener.  They are fabulous and the quality of the pictures on the monitor and printed on a Canon I-960, up to 8 1/2 x 11 size, rivals the ones from the Olympus.<br /><br />The quality of the movie clips is as good as from the C-8080 and better than the 30 sec clips from the G2.<br /><br />The lesson learned, and I think it applies to a vast majority of the people, is that mega pixels matter not specially for the point and shoot type of photography.  I wish I knew that some time ago and not lugged the G2 during my Grand Canyon backcountry hike while not carrying sugar to avoid weighting down the backpack!<br /><br />Update 6/19:  Since this camera is rarely used, the other day when I took it out of its pouch after over a month, it looked sick as the finish had developed these black spots.  Called Canon and they are going to replace the casing.  Hopefully, nothing will get screwed up in transit.  Still think it is a great little camera and was a steal for under $150 back in March.","I just got my camera 2 days ago and am already enjoying it tremendously. It was very easy to figure out and I was able to start using it after charging the battery for a mere 90 minutes (full charge). I purchased a 512 mb SD card as the 19 mb SD card it comes with is virtually useless. the 512 card was only an extra $40 (including shipping) and available on Amazon as well (Viking).<br /><br />I had considered pricier, SLR-type cameras, as I was a photo major and am somewhat of a \"photo snob.\" But I wanted a camera to use for snapshots, something portable and easy to use for nights out with friends and roadtrips, etc. This camera is perfect for snapshots and the resolution is perfect for those size prints. I can't imagine wanting to blow up any of these shots over 8X10 (I'd use my Nikon film camera for those types of shots). Can't wait to bring my SD card to make prints for the first time.<br /><br />This camera is an all-around great buy and I highly recommend it.","I am amazed at the simplicity of this camera , and the results are astonishing.<br /><br />My friends have bought very expensive cameras .. professional looking and they take great photos .. and they have a \"great\" price too.. My camera gives the same results at less than half the cost..<br /><br />This camera is equipped with all the good features that canon gives with its bigger brothers, yet its small in size.. stich assist work like a charm for the panoramas , u can control the shutter speed and light exposure manually- thats ample for night photos.. focus assist and focus lock are cool.<br /><br />I liked the feature to add sound clips to ur snaps.. sort of captures the moment ..<br /><br />Navigation between menu is great , and amazon also refunded 30 dollars after price drop(i got the camera just before this offer) !! I could not have asked for more..<br /><br />check out my snaps from this camera at :<br /><br />photos.yahoo.com/anubhavxgoel<br /><br />cheers !<br /><br />Anubhav","Just couldn't pass up the $150 price point and didnt mind having an extra camera to carry in my back pocket for those just in case moments.  Features surpass my Exilim S2 and image quality is crystal but best of all its Made in Japan.  Attention to quality and detail is amazing.<br /><br />Powerful little camera.  Seems to have many of the features of my Canon G2... Anyways you won't regret this purchase.  A+","I just got it today! I was so excited! It is a great camera for those who are new to Digital cameras. Its small and light. I love the style!  It is easy to get used to. The zoom feature is ok, it would have been better but it is totally fine for everyday use!  The pictures came out great!  The movie mode is awesome.  Overall, this camera is a great buy, and you'll be satisfied of its performance..","I just got my camera yesterday. Its my first digital camera too. I shopped around for one for 5 months. I didnt want to get this one cause it came out last febuary 2004. I was thinking it would be old school. But, now that I have it, i'm so happy. Its small and great. i love it. Its my first digital camera. But, as of now i'm loving it. I'm just using it to take basic pics of friends and stuff. I'm now a photographer to the core, but i like to take snap shots and this camera is great for quick snap shots of friends and stuff. The software is great too and its easy to download to the computer to share with friends. I really like this camera. :)I hope this helps.","Got this camera in July and love the size and weight of it.  Taking pictures was quick and enjoyable and the movie mode has been awesome.  Got exactly what I expected from it until.... in late October the camera would no longer focus properly.  I've never dropped it and it hasn't been heavily used so I just can't explain what happened to it.  When turning the camera on and trying to focus it just gets out of focus regardless of distance to object.  This certainly is a warrantee issue, but luckily I didn't have to deal with Canon (who sound very difficult) due to the fact the airlines lost the bag the camera was in.","The best & the smallest budget camera for point & shoot today. bought it in nov '04 from amazon, loved it since then. 2x zoom may seem less, but i think its fine for everyday use. The pictures always come out sharp & crisp, even under low lighting. Infact i've dropped it twice & nothing happened !! except for a few scratches on its case. Had it been made of plastic, it surely would not have survived. the aluminium casing is a big plus. people go GAGA over it whenever someone sees it for the first time. Its samller than a pack of cigarettes. At the price which its selling right now... don't think anyother camera can beat it in convineance & style.","This camera is by far the best camera I have had.  I cannot speak for those wanting to take complex shots.  I have only used a couple of the specialized modes very rarely, such as black & white.<br /><br />From those who want a great snapshot camera for the money, this is it.  The camera has been in service for about a year now with no problems.  The camera's computer seems to get the autofocus and light levels right just about every time.  Buttons and camera menus are thoughtfully laid out and relatively easy to use.  Some of the hieroglyphics that are used to describe some of the advanced functions are confusing.  Otherwise, I was able to use the camera without reading the instruction booklet.<br /><br />Battery life is exceptional.  I can take about 150 photos with flash and have the LCD screen active.  Switching batteries and SD cards is easy.  The access door on the bottom serves both.<br /><br />The included PC software works relatively well.  The Zoombrowser software lets you page through all photos on the memory card and download only the ones you would like.  The only drawback is that with the larger memory cards, it does take about 60 seconds to show all the photos as thumbnails.  This is not a big problem though.  It is the exact time I need to mix myself a drink...<br /><br />I would recommend getting a 256 or 512kb memory card.  The SD card that is included is small.  I would also suggest users buy an additional battery.  You don't want to be in the middle of a party and be required to charge the battery.  The secondary battery will sit on the shelf for about a month or two before losing its charge.  I purchased an aftermarket battery for about half the cost of the Canon battery.  It seems to have the same performance as the OEM battery.  You may wish to buy the Canon case to preserve the camera's good looks.  I bought the Canon leather case for about $10 from Amazon.<br /><br />Overall, the camera's logical design and small package make it a great choice for snapshot use.","OK, so the camera's probably pretty good, but I wouldn't know.  My daughter saved for a YEAR to buy this cute little guy, and within three weeks it was on its way to the shop.<br /><br />It wasn't really the fault of the camera--it was the fault of the lousy case Canon's marketing to go along WITH the camera.  DO NOT buy the soft leather case--virtually ANYTHING else you can pick up at Wal-Mart (including a folded sheet of Bounty) will protect the camera just as well or better.<br /><br />There is NO point to a stainless-steel bodied camera, in terms of durability, unless that LCD screen is protected as well.  In our case, the camera was in its case, in her purse, before she brought it to me, in tears, with the LCD cracked internally.<br /><br />Of course, this is NOT covered under Canon's warranty (and it's a good reason to buy from another dealer offering an extended warranty that DOES cover accidental damage), and you need to be aware that repairs do not come cheap:  I was quoted a price of $100, plus shipping and handling, and the number rose to $150 once the factory service center had the camera in hand.  (This was a flat rate for an LCD repair on the SD110;  it's not like they determined that there was something else wrong with the camera!) This is just unfair and dishonest business practice, in my opinion, and you may want to reconsider buying a Canon camera on account of it.  Heck, given the price of a brand-new SD110 is about $180, it made ME reconsider having the repair done!<br /><br />Anyway, Canon's reputation for producing a nice camera is one thing, but DO NOT buy their case, and pray fervently that you won't need their service!","Can you get a better camera than this one?  For real.<br /><br />Is that camera going to cost you more? For real.<br /><br />Is the cost difference woth the extra cash?  Not for me.<br /><br />It's small enough to fit in your pocket and takes good pics.  It's probably not enough for the pros or anything, but I don't think the pros were looking at this camera in the first place.","I just got the camera a few days ago. ON the whole I realy like it. the zoom could be better, but they have other cameras for that. The flash is a little bright but its okay too. Most of the time pictures come out great. I have a little bit of truble getting it to focus where i want it too but I think it is my fualt not the cameras. This is my first camera ever so I think some of my problems are that I don't know how to use all the featurea quit right(yes I did read the manual). I think after a little more playing I will have it figuered out and this camera will be my new best friend. However my next camera will be 4 or 5 meagapixles.","If you're not frequently taking pictures of your friends, family and life's minor events... If you wish you had lots of pictures of people through the years, but you don't... It may not be all your fault!  It could just be that your current camera is too big!<br /><br />Even a relatively compact digital camera gets left home when you're heading out for some frisbee in a t-shirt and shorts.  And forget it if you're going to a formal event and that little black purse of yours barely holds your driver's license, some cash and a Chapstick!<br /><br />If you want to take more pictures of your life, get a digital Elph.<br /><br />In the days when I could not carry my camera in my pocket, I would not bring a camera to most \"events\".  I eventually realized that I had hardly any pictures of the people, informal events and  spontaneous moments that make up most of my life.<br /><br />Oh, I had a great SLR camera.  And I took some great shots of Diamond Head and Big Ben!  But I almost always made a conscious decision to leave that camera home when I was just going out with friends or just plain didn't feel like carrying it (e.g.  at football games, casual parties, birthday dinners with friends, camping, etc.)  In other words, camera size dictated -- in advance -- that none of those moments were going to be photographed!<br /><br />Enter the Elph.  I received an APS Elph and all that changed.  Even with its leather \"case\" (it was more like a sleeve), the Elph fit in my pocket.  My coat pocket.  My shirt pocket!  Even my front jeans pocket!<br /><br />These Elph cameras are literally the size of a pack of smokes.<br /><br />Now I have an SD110 digital Elph.  It lives in my coat pocket.  I take pictures of things without any internal debates (e.g. Should I bring the camera?  Is this worth a photo?  How many pictures are left on the roll?  Blah, blah blah.).  Now, I just take the picture!  If I want to keep it, I keep it.  If I don't, I delete it.  If I want to print it, I print it.  If I want to send it via email, I send it.<br /><br />For me, it was all about the size.  As such, the Elph was the perfect choice.<br /><br />The other reviewers have covered eveything, but I'll add a few comments just to back them up.<br /><br />As for specs, the 3.2 megapixel, 2x optical zoom is just fine for the casual shutter-bug.  That made the SD110 a good choice for me because it was adequate and still relatively inexpensive.  The resolution is photo quality and that's all I need. As for the 2x instead of 3x optical zoom, if I want to zoom closer, I use my anatomical zoom (i.e. I step closer to my subject).  But if that's not good enough for you, there are Elphs galore to meet your needs.<br /><br />An Elph is small, right?, so it doesn't take regular batteries.  That means you can't run to the store for batteries if it goes dead.  All I'm saying is that, unlike cameras that use, say, AA rechargable batteries and, therefore, regular batteries in a pinch, the Elph requires some forethought.  I.e., if you're traveling or you think your battery is not going to make it through that all-day event, plan ahead.  Maybe get a second battery and/or throw the charger in the car and/or get a car charger, etc.  After market accessories are available and are a lot cheaper than the Canon's.<br /><br />The Elphs take great pictures, have great automatic features and plenty of manual options if you're so inclined.<br /><br />The $5 leather case (amazon.com) meant for the APS Elph will do just fine.  It doesn't fit like a glove, but it's only $5!<br /><br />As with any camera, forget the 16MB card.  Plan on getting a 256MB (on the web, they can be had for as little as $20 with some rebates).  256MB will seem like more than you'll ever use!<br /><br />I also recommend that you get a card reader eventually (around $20).  That way, you can download, edit, and upload back to the card (for that trip to the store for prints) without hooking the camera up to the PC.<br /><br />The included ZoomBrowser software seems more cumbersome than other software I already have, but it works.<br /><br />Good luck!","I wanted to get a smaller digital camera than my Pentax D380 (great camera but not pocket size).  BUT I did not want to spend big bucks.  I actually bought a smaller Pentax but returned it - you get what you pay for and it was too cheap.  I jumped on amazon and read the reviews for the Canon SD110.  So I dove in and bought it.  In my experience, it is the best value and has the most features of any camera in its class.  If you are just point and shoot and develop 4X6 prints, this is it.<br /><br />I also bought a 256 card and a back up battery.  The card included is a joke - holds about 15 pics.  Small warning:  the camera has no continual battery power indicator light - when low it just suddenly flashes a red battery icon at which point you have about 5 pics left - then it goes dead.  Just keep a back up handy.<br /><br />I love this camera.  Amazon was great - shipped it fast, free and gave me the best price.","Bought this cam with my first salery and , it was the coolest piece i bought myself for christmas. This cam is compact ,just the size of ur palm which makes it easy to carry.Coupled with the canon's latest technology I rate this piece as something which gives you your moneyz worth.","I bought not only one but a few of this camera and gave it as gifts. It is easy to use and fast. Just buy it for the price, you will not regret.","I own three digital cameras and a pricy SLR and the Canon SD110 has made all the others obsolete.  This camera changed my photo-taking behavior and excitement, and now I always carry it in my bag or pocket.  First, you should know Canon and Nikon make the best digital cameras - primarily because they were smart in outsourcing electronics to the best Chinese component manufacturers (Flextronics, Celestica) and used their own industry-leading optical lenses.  I prefer Canon because of ease of use (both camera and downloading to PC), braoder range of sophisticated features, rock solid reliability, accessories (you must get the cute leather case... all your friends will ask!), and the cameras just *look* and *feel* infinitely cooler.<br /><br />The SD110 is a small, powerful, high performer even among its Canon peers.  Though I provide a balanced view below, as a connoisseur of every new technology out there for cameras, I can attest this little machine boasts a ton of horsepower.<br /><br />The Pros include:<br /><br />1. Great pictures (up to 8\"x10\")<br /><br />- balanced color resolution (thanks to the Digic processor)<br /><br />- outside pictures are brilliant, inside pictures come out fine, though the flash is a bit strong to compensate<br /><br />- nice redeye reduction, but this does delay the picture by a half second or so<br /><br />- photo zoom mode, so you can zoom into part of a picture (or \"move around\" the picture) to check clarity, color, etc. immediately after taking the shot<br /><br />2. Customizable features on par with top-line cameras<br /><br />- all the same features of my Canon Rebel 2000 SLR and 3x more expensive Powershot G5. Landscape, portrait, moving images,<br /><br />- color schemes are better and broader than Nikon, Sony, and Olympus: black & white, sepia, neutral, vivid, etc.<br /><br />3. Ease of use<br /><br />- simple menu structure, no complicated buttons<br /><br />- delete bad pictures with ease, effectively increasing your total photo capacity<br /><br />- photo inventory mode (advancement from earlier Canon models) that lets you look at 8-12 pictures simultaneously and flip quickly through memory by screen shots rather than one picture at a time (critical for memory cards over 64MB)<br /><br />- \"smart\" download to Canon Zoombrowser (software that comes with the camera) - just plug in and it automatically downloads<br /><br />- Zoombrowser software (new version) is clearly superior to earlier generations, and I did not need to buy Photoshop (other camera brands come with a poor software interface so you need to spend an add'l $80-100 on photo editing software)<br /><br />4. Physical attributes<br /><br />- compact and lighter than even the S300/400/500 series, fits in your pocket or purse easily<br /><br />- SD card is wafer thin and cheaper than compactflash (which most other cameras use)<br /><br />- nice silver/chrome metal finish that catches the eye<br /><br />- solid rechargable battery (can take 80-100 pictures using the LCD screen) before next recharge<br /><br />- recharger is small and very cool: battery slips into the bay, and the unit goes right into the wall socket<br /><br />- one touch on-off (does NOT turn on-off by accident as some other cameras do)<br /><br />The Cons (none of these are deal-breakers):<br /><br />1. optical zoom (2x) could be more powerful but digital zoom does a decent job compensating (G5 and SLRs are superior here)<br /><br />2. shutter speed can be improved: 1.0 second to take pictures (vs. 0.2sec for SLR, 0.5sec for G5), and then you can adjust how long the camera holds the LCD image for you to see<br /><br />3. Included memory card (16MB) is useless.  Think of this as a \"practice starter\"; you will want at least a 128MB SD (120 pix) or 256MB SD (245 pix) memory cards - both cheap and under $30 extra.  Picture counts are estimated and at high resolution<br /><br />You will not regret buying this camera.  Simply amazing how much this has changed my picture taking behavior.","I can describe this camera in one word: FABULOUS. This little camera is the whole deal, all rolled up into a tiny package. It has everything you'd need. It takes great picture with amazing clarity and vibrant colors, the videos are of great quality, and on top of that, it is the most adorable camera I've ever seen.<br /><br />The 16MB memory card included with this camera is much too small, so I'd definitely recommend buying one that is at least 256MB. I have a 512MB SanDisk memory card. On the highest setting for this camera (superfine at 2048x1536), it holds about 302 pictures. On the lowest (normal at 640x480), it holds 4419.<br /><br />Battery life has been okay. It's not amazing, but it is pretty good, considering the camera's size and functions. If you turn off the LCD, it saves a lot of battery, but I definitely prefer to use it. Also, some people have recommended buying an extra battery. I personally have not, but if you are going to be going on a trip where you won't be able to plug in the battery charger, it'd be helpful.<br /><br />The body of the SD110 is very sturdy. It's a cool silver-white metal (though at times it looks almost champage. Amazon's pictures are somewhat misleading because the color of the camera looks different in real life) and has not yet gotten a scratch. Just in case, however, I bought the PSC-50 soft leather case. Though I wish it was included, it's only an additional $10 and can keep your camera in tip-top shape.<br /><br />If you are just a snap-shot photographer like me (I take pictures of friends, etc), then this is the best camera to get. If you are looking for something more professional and need more than 2X optical zoom, then you might want to reconsider. All in all, this is an amazing camera, and you should most definitely buy it!","I won't give this camera five stars because that would reflect perfection and that just does not exist.  So I'll give it four stars with major prejudice toward the fifth.  I generally shoot video, but really hate those camcorder/camera combinations.  If you want to shoot video, get a camcorder. If you want to shoot stills, get a camera.  So that is what I did. This unit is exceptional. I mean exceptional in every way. Clean, well designed, simply to use, and it offers manual controls that allow the artistic side in all of us.  I hear complaint about the zoom. Granted, you might be a sports or nature photographer and need a long lens, but most of us folk can simply move closer for some tight framing.  I also purchased the underwater case and was really impressed with that unit. Fits the camera like a glove, plus give you access to all controls. I'm using it when I shoot in very bad weather.  Get this camera. lt don't buy the AC power adapter. Amazon's web site stated it would work on the SD110 but it does not. I had to return it.","This little camera takes incredibly good pictures, very nice colors and excelent size. functionality is friendly user, and the features are very good. however its sad to say that customer support is not what I expected of Canon, my camera's metal case (2 months old) has started to deteriorate in a great matter. I took it to a cannon representative and they said that Canon would only replace the case but not the camera. considering that this is a new camera and that this is a known quality problem for them I think that they could of done better and replace the unit. if you are considering buying this device take in consideration that Canon has recently discontinued this unit due to quality issues.","Ive had my camera for over 6 months now, i take it everywhere.  its small and light and functional.  I just throw it in my bag or pocket and take pictures of everyone and everything.  im the resident camera taker of my group of friends.<br /><br />i only wish it had greater optical zoom, becuz who needs digital when u can crop on your computer.  all in all...great camera.","I bought this a couple months ago and am very pleased. The pictures come out great, it's easy to use, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE how small it is!! I needed something REALLY small, that I can carry around in my pocketbook, and this fits the bill. Once you see how small it is, you'll realize how BIG some of the others are, like the Kodak EasyShares. Battery life is excellent, and I know that's a HUGE problem with the EasyShares and many other cameras. I did a lot of research before buying and I'm very happy with my purchase. DEFINITELY buy a second battery, and always have it ready just in case.<br /><br />I haven't figured out all the manual controls yet, but I like that they're there for when I become more advanced.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed, I'm very picky, and it's a GREAT camera!","If you just need a digital camera to take pictures in the sun light, you can almost pick any digital camera.<br />But if you want your camera to take great pictures under all different light conditions (i.e. in door, with dark background, wedding photos and other complex light situations), then Canon SD110 will be the only choice. Thanks to Canon DIGIC Image Processor and iSAPS Technology, this Canon SD110 really takes perfect pictures in all different light conditions, which no compact digital camera from other vender can match.<br />However the Canon case for SD110 is very dispointing, which is really designed for the bigger S500/S410 and is too big for SD110/SD100.<br />I found the most beautiful, perfect fitting leather case for Canon SD110/SD100 from [...]","I don't understand the review of the person below that complains about this camera. This is one of the best and easy to use. I have the S400 and got this one for my sister. This one is smaller and lighter than mine, and the quality is as good. Yes, you will need to purchase a bigger capacity SD Memory card, but now a days those are cheap. The video function is easy to use and the quality is very good. I highly recommend this camera.","My only complaint about the camera is the stingy SD card size of 16MB, but this is cheap and easy enough to fix.<br />Apart from that this camera seems to be an excellent buy. The battery charges very quickly, and seems to provide good life.<br />The photo quality is great, and the automatic mode seems to expose and fill-flash perfectly in every situation, similar to my Canon SLR.<br />The video feature works very well, and the microphone quality seems excellent even with a lot of background noise.<br />The flash seems to work great for indoor use (not tried outdoor yet) giving nice even coverage, and perfect exposures. The red-eye reduction seems to work great also.<br />The build quality seems to be great, and the bundled PC software and TV out cables mean that this camera can do pretty much everything I could want.<br />I would recommend this camera in a heartbeat if you are looking for a small point and shoot.","After much consulting with my camera expert friend, I bought this camera. And after help from the camera guy in Target. I liked the Movie Mode with sound and picture quality... but I RETURNED THE CAMERA. I did not like how it zoomed. It only had a 2x zoom. I wanted more- so I got more for cheaper!","I just purchased this camera from my local camera retailer (cheaper than Amazon.com, if you can believe it!) after debating on the wisdom of forking over my money for this little machine.  I have a fabulous Fujifilm S3000 digicam with a lot of zoom and great picture taking capibility, but I found I needed a smaller camera to carry around for those times when the S3000 would be too much of a hassle to haul places.  That said, I knew deep down that I was pretty much set on the Canon PowerShot SD110 just because it was so darn cute.  It's tiny, smaller than the Elph that a friend of mine bought last year, and can easily fit into the smallest of my purses without taking up much room at all.  The size alone was what had initially sold me on it, and the fact that it has a good reputation for being a decent digicam (for reference, it's smaller than the average pack of cigarettes and more compact than some cell phones).<br />The biggest detractor for this camera is the optical zoom, however.  It's just not as much as I would prefer, but that's a personal thing and others may find it works well for their needs.  Since I have the larger Fujifilm camera to fill in for those times when I need a lot of optical zoom, the SD110 is perfect for just about any other situation.  I also like the fact that it takes video with sound, the first of all of my digicams to offer audio recording.<br />The 3.2 MP is more than enough for quality photos, and I'm quite satisfied with the resolution.  The flash seems a little harsh, but just a bit so.  I like the fact that opperates on a rechargable battery, although this may present problems if you run out of juice somewhere where it's not possible to plug in the charger (camping trips, foreign countries, etc).  In that case, it's wise to bring around a full charged back up battery.<br />I also bought a Lexar MMC/SD Reader and 256 MB memory card while at the store.  The reader plugs into my computer via the USB port and the memory card is removed from the camera and inserted into the reader, which then uploads the photos.  It's good to avoid draining the battery by directly hooking up the camera to the computer, although it's obviously not necessary if you don't wish to purchase it at an additional cost.","Let's be serious. Most people aren't going to need that $2000 digital SLR camera with the 15X opitical zoom that looks like it'd be really cool to carry around and make everyone else very jealous of you. If you're looking for a great camera that you can carry around in your front pocket and not have people laugh at the bulge, then the SD110 is great. It's got just enough for you to have great photos of the people you care about without having to worry about things like shutter speed and ruining the moment. Best of all, it's inexpensive. I just got mine delivered last week and would definitely buy it again. One thing that is a must is buying at least a 64mb SD card; the 16 mb card that comes with the camera is pathetically small and will force you to have to keep running back to the computer all the time. Other than that, it's a great buy. Especially at amazon's price.","The SD110 is identical to the older SD100 model in every aspect, both technical specs and picture quality, except the SD110 model comes with the new PictBridge button, which gives you one-button printing to PictBridge-compatible photo printers.  It's convenient if you never post-process your digital images, but I think most of us do perform some kind of enhancements like contrast adjustment and cropping.  So it's better if you get the SD100 model for a lot less.<br />I don't like the 2x optical zoom.  Everyone else is doing 3x, why is Canon still giving us 2x on ultra-compacts?","I've chose this camera over Pentax Optio S4, Minolta Xg, and I've tried SD100 as well. Both Minolta and Pentax had better specs (x3 Zoom, 4Mp), however SD110 ends up making better pictures, and with no effort what so ever.<br /> It is, probably, one of the easiest cameras to use. Automatic settings work perfect in almost all the cases. If you'd want to get comparable picture quality from other cameras you'll have to fiddle with manual controls for a few minutes, otherwise you get 4Mp worth of crap (and with high zoom factor as well).<br />Manual mode is rather simple, although lets you take good night shots (up to 15 sec. exposures). Macro mode is not as great as in other cameras, though.<br />Start up time is fast enough. Zoom is fast and very easy to control. Other controls are also well placed. One feature I particularly like is that it has separate \"Func\" and \"Menu\" buttons. \"Menu\" has basic camera settings, which are not used very often, and the \"Func\" menu contains all the picture settings, such as exposure compensation, ISO mode, compression quality, resolution, etc. It makes it much easier to find and change the settings you really need. The only thing I find inconvenient is the lack of a separate \"quick view\" button. It is necessary to use the mode selector instead.<br />Movie mode could be better too. Zoom and exposure are fixed the same moment you start shooting, so you do not have the same flexibility as a regular video camera (or Minolta Xg) has. At 640x480 resolution, max you can get is 30 sec at 15 fps, which makes this mode pretty much useless. The 320x240 mode is more practical in this sense. And the in-camera movie editing can help save some storage space when you need it.<br />As for the lens, you do get some purple fringing in rare cases. Vignetting is lower than in other ultra-compacts. Auto focus and resolution are also pretty good compared to the competition. I guess Canon decided to go a different way than the competition. They traded off zoom ratio instead of picture quality for the compactness.<br />To put it all together. If you want fast and easy to use point-and-shoot camera that takes great pictures as well, there is nothing better to choose from. Even considering all its weak points, it is still the best camera there is in its market segment.<br />I regret that I didn't get an SD100 for $60 less, though. Since I print all my pictures at Costco anyways, and do not need the stupid PictBridge button.","So today is my third day with my SD110, and I've been having a great time with it. So here is a neat pros and cons list:<br />pros:<br />size- It's small, which is convienient.<br />  nice outdoor shots- Every shot I've taken outside has turned out very beautiful. I took it out to a nearby garden and took pics of the flowers. The colors are vivid.<br />  video with sound- Well, a lot of cameras offer video with sound, but I really like this feature. It's really fun taking random clips of thing.<br />  easy to use- I read most of the manual because I'm a real dork about that kind of stuff, but most of the things I could have figured out on my own.<br />  battery life- so far, so good. I've been liberal with the number of photos I take to get a feel for how long the battery will last. I've taken about 60-70 photos, not to mention a number of movie clips, which add up to about 10 or so minutes. Not to mention all the time spent playing around with the menus (yeah, switching to foreign languages is fun!). So I might be near the end of the battery soon...maybe tomorrow...<br /><br />cons:<br />indoor shots- It's kind of difficult getting an indoor shot that I like, especially at night. The flash seems a little too strong and a lot of things in the foreground end up looking all over-lit and such. Although, I'm not a very experienced photographer and I'm still working out all the different functions so perhaps as I get more practice these will turn out better.<br />  battery- After taking a lot of photos in a row, the battery pack starts to get kinda hot...and it's at the spot where you hold the camera, too. I vaguely remember the manual saying something about being careful about that. Also, the battery takes a long time to charge, so that isn't fun if you're wanting to take pictures.<br />not sure whether it's pro or con: zoom- The zoom on this camera is not very strong. That was my biggest argument against buying this camera, since I'm kinda crazy about zoom when I use my film camera. However, I found the zoom to be adequate for the types of photos I take (snapshots of friends, etc)...not as much as I'd like, but also I don't feel like I'm missing out, though.<br />All in all, I think if you're just a casual photographer, this camera is pretty good. After looking at so many cameras before finally buying this one, I came to realize that what mattered the most is your intended use for the camera. So buying a 5.0 MP or higher camera just b/c there's more pixels is not going to do you much good if you never make huge prints of your photos. If you just want something that can take some decent pictures of the school picnic or your dog and is easy to carry, SD110 might be the right camera for you.","I've had this camera for just over a month now and I can't even begin to tell you how happy I am with it. But I'm gonna try.<br />From my understanding, Canon went with the SD format on this camera to cut down on its body size, and it shows. Stylish and sturdy without the bulkiness and weight of other cameras, you can literally throw it in your pocket or purse and go.<br />Usability on this little number is top-notch. The AiAf focusing helps to ensure that you get the best photos every time, and the red eye reduction is on par with some of the best consumer cameras I've seen. Best of all, it's easy to use for anybody to use (my kid brother loves it more than I do), but when you're ready for something more, the camera's Manual Mode gives you a bevvy of options to work with.<br />The battery seems to go as long as you do (though I recommend buying an extra battery to be on the safe side), and how Canon managed to pack 3.2 MP's worth of quality into the SD110 is beyond me.<br />Setup on my computer was a snap. Running Mac OS 10.3, all I did was plug my camera in and voila, the camera was recognized immediately! I haven't tried the included software but if you have Apple's iPhoto you really don't need it.<br />In addition to an extra battery (the batteries on this camera are rechargeable, by the way), you would be wise to purchase a bigger memory card as the included 16MB SD card simply doesn't do it justice. With a 256MB SD card (I've been using Delkin's eFilm card), I can fit 152 photos at the camera's highest quality and size settings.<br />In short, if what you're looking for is a no-nonsense camera for those precious moments that treads the balance of form and function, look no further than the SD110.","I got this camera a week ago and I can find nothing to complain about.  It's quick, takes great pictures, small but sturdy, bright vivid LCD, with a great battery, charger and print functionality.  The only minor issue is the 16M card in a 3.2 MP camera.  But, a 16M card is still about standard for any company so no marks off here.","The Canon Powershot SD110 is the most practical, compact, easy to use digital camera. Yes, it's expensive and I do recommend an extra 256 SD card, but the money is all worth it. I just bought the camera a few weeks ago, and the reviews for the SD100 are basically the reviews for this one. None of the bad things that they say about the camera are true exept I do recommend an extra battery. The battery takes 95 minutes to charge and the manual says it can take over 210 images with the screen. If, however, your battery is running low, it will give you a 10 second warning. Not much... The SD100 and the SD110 are just about the same camera but the SD110 has a much faster shutter speed and has a print button which I find no use of. The quality of the pictures of this camera are absoulutely beautiful. The camera has settings of normal (1 mp), fine (2 mp), and superfine (3 mp) (I think). I took pictures in fine mode and they were the most beautiful pictures I've ever seen! The superfine mode pictures were even better. The inside shots are sweet! People lie about the quality of the pictures indoors. Why sit here and read my review about the camera..... GO BUY IT, YOU WILL ABSOULUTELY REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T!","Compared to Nikon Coolpix 3200, Minolta Dimage series, untested new models from Fuji. Budget = $(price).<br />At $(price), the closest competitors were the larger 4-AA battery A series from Canon and two models from Sony: one old, one new. I was leaning toward Sony until I priced their memory.<br />The SD110 had everything I wanted: steel body, small size, fairly affordable media, optical zoom, video w/sound, TV out.<br />Why four stars and not five? Two reasons: SD memory is expensive compared to CompactFlash and the battery is proprietary (not purchasable at a corner store).<br />Why not the S400? It was fourty dollars more and thus over budget. I figure last year's top-quality camera is still okay.<br />SD is still cheaper than Sony Memory Stick and smaller. Price 'em out and you'll see any benefits from Sony are dampened by high memory costs. Further, MMC cards will fit in the SD110 and work fine, so if you see a closeout on MMC 128 MB (the largest size in MMC) you're free to buy that too. And generic batteries on Ebay are plenty cheap.<br />This camera rules for so many reasons. Read the S100's review at Cnet.com and add the new printer standards like PictBridge.<br />UPDATE: I bought the Canon i560 PictBridge-compatible printer and tried the technology for the first time. Results? Eh, middlin'. I didn't have the opportunity to edit the picture or change the advanced printer settings. Today, it's easier to put the image on your PC and print from there.<br />However, in the future, I could see PictBridge becoming a retail kiosk standard, where you could print pictures by plugging in your camera. This beats plugging in your memory card to the Sam's Club computer, because such cards could easily contain virus proggies, which I bet companies have developed PictBridge to help avoid..."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S1 IS","amazon_reviews":["Waste of time and money, The camera does not work, it cannot work, even after investing money for memory cards, and batteries, its a waste.","This was a *magnificent* camera, back when I originally bought it, which was in the 2004-2005 timeframe.  At that time, 10x optical zoom was un-heard-of in a non-DSLR camera; I used this very much in my hiking photography, and its imagery was wonderful!<br /><br />However... the $599 price that is shown here, is simply absurd!!  I don't know why they're even bothering to show such a price.  At the time that I got it, $600 was *FAR* out of my price range!!  I don't have receipt any more, but it was something in the $250 range.  In these days, of course, you can get a Canon SX230HS for about this price, with 12X optical zoom and FAR more capability.<br /><br />So in general, my statement is, if you can get this for a reasonable price (I can't suggest a number, but it would have to be much less than $200 in my mind), you will get a superb camera that will provide excellent image quality with a very modest image size... since I use my images mostly for wallpaper, 3 Mpixels is plenty for a 1920x1080 HDMI monitor...","my son loves this camera...","I love that the package came earlier than expected","Canon had problem with this S1 - was replaced with a used S5.","At first it didnt work, not sure if it was me or what. I was gonna return it then the next day I decided to try it again and it was working.

I have taken the camera to 6 of the 7 continents including 2 weeks exploring Antarctica. Don't leave it in a hot car, be careful of water on your fingers at the beach, and don't drop it...hard. I have had to get the camera repaired after all of those mishaps, but would rather have done that than to learn another camera. I was really sold when the local camera repairman said I had all the camera I needed and repaired the camera as opposed to selling me a more expensive upgrade in his own store, which I was prepared to do.<br /><br />The best thing I like are the attachable telephoto and wide angle lenses that are available. I am learning a lot about photography and the use of different lenses at a more affordable price, a more compact unit, and a unit that is easy to use.<br /><br />Yes there is a lag in focus time as described by others and I can see that when I pick up someone else's camera. I am at times jealous of some of the shots I see from friends' phones. Also, the camera has a limit on the length of time I can leave the shutter open and that keeps me from getting shots of star trails. Other than that, it's exceptional!<br /><br />So if you are looking to upgrade from the point and shoot and learn a bit more about how to manipulate a camera and its lenses to maximize shots, this camera is the one to use.","I bought one of these used a year ago and I LOVE my camera. It takes great quality pictures for the price it is - it's perfect for novice point&shoot use but has a good enough zoom and enough settings it can also take semi-professional shots in the hands of a good enough photographer. I have several friends with far nicer cameras that have been shocked at the image quality of my S1. Overall a very good camera.","The Canon Powershot IS S1 is a good product... should work well for some time... but with a -potential- bad defect, the CCD sensor.  At some point, it -may- fail, rendering only a black/purple screen/pictures... although you may be able to view old pix/movies from your storage card.<br /><br />Don't throw your camera way, you don't have to pay.<br /><br />This is a known failure affecting -many- brands of cameras, and Canon decided they will REPAIR it for FREE (including paying shipping and handling both ways) REGARDLESS of warranty status.<br /><br />There is a Canon 'advisory' stating such... since I can't post the URL, you'll have to search the web for it... search for \"Canon CCD Sensor Service Advisory\"<br /><br />As for their service... sending a note to their \"carecenter\" email results in their providing a few steps to check, and then they'll send a UPS shipping label for you to use for shipping to their repair facility. Heavily document the matter... copy emails and the product advisory in with your shipment... leave out accessories.  (Some Canon models' repair window has expired, is expiring this year, 2011, so be sure of meeting that requirement.)<br /><br />For more info on the subject you can search for 'canon-digital-cameras-showing-black' (good instructions) and 'imaging-resource  badccds' (detailed info).<br /><br />Otherwise, the Powershot IS S1 is very versatile, inexpensive, good cam.","This is a great, great camera, but canon should take care seriously about the lens error of the camera after 5000-10000 shots. My camera was replaced at the first time without any question, but 7 years after buying it I had the same problem with the lens and the camera unusable, without a single drop or dust on it. It works only to display images. After checking other reviews, I can see there is a common damage to almost all the S line after a period. I wish I could compare to Sony, Nikon or Panasonic in lens duration.","Excellent camera for an older model. Viewscreen is small but clear even in bright light. Viewfinder washes out some in bright light. Battery life excellent so far. Picture quality excellent.","We bought the same camera 4 yrs ago when our first daughter was born. Used it like proud parents! We then used it again on our second child and on many many vacations, school events, birthdays, etc. The original camera was sturdy and gave us the best quality pictures we could have ever wanted. Well, it finally broke down and was too expensive to fix. I found a used on on Amazon and was a bit reluctant but for $110, what the heck. I was very pleased with the packaging and quality of the camera. It looks like new and works better than our first camera. Best camera for the money!","I bought this camera in 2005 and I still use it as my preferred camera. I also own an Elf Camera by Canon that I love, but the S series is so versatile. I only had to learn a little bit about digital photography to be able to take incredible pictures with this thing. When I bought it, I sacrificed some megapixels in order to get the great zoom and it was well worth it... especially since there's no way I'll ever need a print larger than 11x14. It's easy to use, reliable, and I'm very satisfied with the pictures it takes. The multi-angle LCD screen really comes in handy too.","Bought this camera in 2005. It has been a good camera. Simple to use for my wife who wanted a simple point and shoot and with enough adjustments to offer flexibility for myself.<br /><br />Has worked great until vacation this summer(July, 2009). The image sensor went bad on the first day of vacation. Thankfully, we brought my camera with us(I purchased a digital SLR a little over a year ago to satisfy my inner photographer), so we didn't lose out.<br /><br />When we got home from vacation, I did a little searching on the internet and found out about the Sony CCD problem and that Canon would repair at no cost. Canon customer service was extremely helpful and very rapid in their response to my e-mail. Canon paid for shipping, repaired it, and sent it back in perfect working order. And no, it was not a ploy to get the camera in the shop for other expensive repairs, as another reviewer posted. The entire process from initial e-mail to Canon until I got the camera back was 2 weeks. I'm still quite impressed.","Received as a birthday gift in 2004. I was unaware of the PowerShot S series at the time, but have the PowerShot G2 model.<br /><br />Have had the PowerShot S1 IS for over 5 1/2 years now and still works great. Its LCD went black (known malfunction) in June 2008 and sent to Canon to have it repaired. It was well out of warranty, but had replaced free of charge because of the defect. Received it a few weeks later and has worked as it should ever since. For some reason, its picture quality is a smidgen less from before the repair. I have recently purchased Panasonic DMC-ZS3.<br /><br />Overall experience...<br /><br />- Taking photos of the snow comes out clear and not too blue under ambient sunlight. Takes great sunset photos without the flash. Once took many photos of the Moon - even lunar eclipse twice, with decent results on maxed zoom. However, it takes trial and error because focusing is difficult with dark/bright subject.<br />- Picture quality very good, but has compression artifacts and some grain/noise.<br />- Movies are quite yellow and grainy under incandescent lighting, but much cleaner and whiter under fluorescent. Does surprisingly well in grayscale (B&W) on well-light highways at nighttime, especially in the rain and snow (albedo effect helps?). Recording movies has subtle-bright vertical bars, i.e. chandelier, tail/head lights, and sun (says a phenomenon with CCD in the user manual), but as with any given CCD camera, these bars aren't recorded in the photos.<br />- Excellent movie recording at the time of this model, but mono sound to the newer S2 IS (I don't have that camera).<br />- Don't record movies with alkaline batteries - after two minutes, they are exhausted. With NiMH Duracell batteries, once I recorded about an hour of movies before the low battery light came on display. Have not tried lithium.<br />- Recording movies with high-capacity card works well, but using a standard (not high-speed) card will cause corruption, or more likely, intermittent dropped frames, especially when moving or zooming quickly on the fine setting. Use of 640 X 480 @ 15 fps on any speed card recorded w/o problem.<br /><br />Suitable with the neck strap and small case, but not for carrying in your pocket (why I purchased the Panasonic). I would recommend this camera, and if you do buy it, check for firmware updates and watch out for any LCD defect. If the camera's viewfinder starts flickering intermittent green/purple blotches, it is a matter of short notice the display will go black, needing repair.<br /><br />Camera Window has a tendency to malfunction on PC and Mac (uncertain of its known issues), but when it works, copying the data is straightforward, but will copy 1-2 megabytes per second via USB.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful. Overall, I'd rate this camera B to B+.","I love using this camera with my underwater case.  I have been able to take clear and amazing pictures underwater here at the Channel Islands off  California and on a recent trip to Galapagos Islands. It takes great pictures in and out of water.  My first digital camera and my favorite so far.","My original Powershot S1-IS broke one day, it was cheaper buying a used camera than to repair original.  Item shipped as promised, in a timely manner.  Very satified.","I have had this camera for 3 years now, if you are not looking for SLR's and wanna practice shooting with manual settings (e.g. shooting time etc.) this is a very good camera. It was the smallest camera for 10x optical zoom at the time, I am not quite sure if it still holds the title: so it's also quite compact, which is also good. The video is also quite high quality, I wasn't expecting to use this camera that long, but it's still responding to my needs successfully.<br /><br />[...] If you have a good reason to buy this one instead of another cam, don't hesitate.","I purchased this canon powershot s1 about 4 years ago.  This was (and still is) my first digital camera.  At 3.2 MP's I think it takes great pictures and I really like the 10x zoom.  The zoom factor was the main reason I bought this camera.  About 3 months ago, while on vacation, I started having problems with the viewfinder.  When I got home I did some research and discovered a lot of people have had the same problem.  I contacted Canon and they sent me shipping labels so I could pack up my camera and send it to them for repair. They fixed it for free (I was sort of hoping they would send me a new camera, like a S5, but I didn't really expect it).  I'm quite happy with the Canon company and I'm very happy to have my camera back in good working condition.","I have had this camera for over five years and have carried it almost everywhere with me. This camera has hiked the Great Wall of China as well as carried around in my backpack on a daily basis. I have never had any mechanically problems with it, nor have I ever lost any pictures. You don't have to spend extra money on more MP's if you plan on using it to do regular sort of stuff. I can not say enough about this amazing product. [....]","I bought this camera way back in 2004. I took it on numerous trips, Thailand, Bombay and of course I used it at home as well...<br /><br />It gave fantastic service, I took some really great photos all over. I had trouble iwth it once, when I had to take it into Canon repair for the pop up flash, which wouldn't pop up.<br /><br />Apart from that, nary a complaint. (Being a novice photographer, I guess I wasn't too demanding to begin with).<br /><br />About six months ago, the LCD/EVF conked off... I would get  a haze and then later I would get a line and black screen. The first few weeks I was in denial. It can't happen to me etc. and then I was too busy to take it in for repair. I was to go on another overseas trip, so I finally decided to get the camera fixed and handed it into canon.<br /><br />I was told, that the parts to fix are not being made any more. My first reaction as... oh crap.<br /><br />BUT, they replaced this camera with Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP 12X FREE of charge.<br /><br />Thank You Canon! I need to buy a Point and Shoot. No prizes for guessing, which brand of camera I'm going for...","I purchased this camera in Oct 2004.  In January 2008 the viewfinder went blank (dark) no picture.  Before this, it had a few pictures with lines through them (distorted).  I did not purchase this camera from Amazon. This camera worked great for me and took really good pictures, but I am very disappointed that it would break just a little over 3 years old.  It should last longer than this.  I carried it back to the store where I had purchased it, because I had the service plan.  After 3 weeks, they called and told me they would do an exchange because they could not get the parts to fix it.  I did like this camera but it is just a shame that it does not last long.","I bought this camera with my then-boyfriend to backpack across Europe with for the summer of '05, and it was, with a few exceptions, perfect for the situation.  It was worth the extra 3 pounds given the options of the smaller point and shoots that year, especially with the 10x zoom.  Our outdoor shots were phenomenal, and though it's very tricky to get a good shot in low-light situations without a flash - which I'm not really a fan of using - we got some very good shots at night and indoors.  The 3.2 mp is deceivingly awesome as well, I've been able to make beautiful poster-size prints out of many shots!!  I wouldn't buy it again because there are more improved point-and-shoots available now, but there are some features that rival even the performance of some of today's camera's.<br /><br />I've heard of the fabled \"E18 error\" with these Canon models, and complaints of various problems from poor build quality, but this thing survived in top condition through being tossed around in our hiking backpacks for two months; trains, taxis, long treks on foot, camping, and even a moped tour.  It took a fair amount of knocks without problems, and is still working great 2 1/2 years later.<br /><br />My only complaints are the sluggish, sometimes 2-second delay response of it's picture taking (which is helped by depressing the shutter button halfway to give time for the autofocus to figure things out), it's less than awesome performance with action shots, and the aforementioned difficulty with low-light.  Other than that, I'm sorry that my ex-boyfriend got custody of it!","Superb point and shoot camera, bright and colorful pictures, excelent movie mode (with zooming and sound), but on November 2007 begins with the \"flickering lcd screen\" and about a week later no image, no photo, no nada (nothing), i was able to review my taken photos and movies but i can't take new pictures, i was a victim of the infamous CCD problem for this model, you can read about it at :<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />there under the \"Canon\" section you can find this little Gem (what a pity and waste of money).","Canon S1 IS is a great camera and as promised by various digi cam review sites, it is good for people in the intermediate range, i.e. between rookie (point and shoot) and pro (SLR and costly lens). Overall performance is great, focus, pic quality, battery consumption, ergonomics etc.<br /><br />Some people say it is bulky but remember what all it is capable of, so i dont mind it.<br /><br />However there are 2 things that become an irritation overtime......<br /><br />1] It takes ages to focus fast moving objects (like jumping Dolphins in Sea World or flying jets in an Air show). I have seen better performance in simple $120 worth digi cams!!<br /><br />2] Within the 1st 2 months there were 5 dead pixels (now it is 8 months since I bought the camera - no new dead pixels).","The S1 is the only camera I could find with a fairly high power zoom that also has a waterproof box which can be bought separately (no, it does not fit the S3). Although the retail price is a bit steep, I found a used camera with cleaning kit, filters, 3x lens, wide angle lens, etc. I ended up paying nearly $500 but I have a very versatile camera which I don't plan to replace for a long time. 3.2 mp works fine up to printer size paper. 2500 mah nimh batteries last plenty long enough and custom white blanking allows impressive low light pictures. I mostly use the auto setting because I still haven't explored all of the features explained in the manual.","I've had this camera for more than 2 years and I'm ready to upgrade to the s3 version although this camera is still working great after years of moderate-heavy use as our \"family camera\".  Although the size isn't all that convenient, it's fantastic movie mode means you can sell your camcorder.  I have a professional Canon that I use in my wedding business, but this is in the bag for a backup situations and short video clips.  If you practice in the creative modes, adjusting white balance, ect, not only will you get better, more creative photos-making this easy to use camera fun for an amateur photographer- you'll overcome the low-light situation mentioned in other reviews.  Also I have lots of great photos from family trips taken in dark caves, around campfires and Disney at night.  Just read the manual and use the right mode for the situation.  A common mistake is using the portrait at night mode instead of the action at night in the auto modes.","VERY sensitive to cold weather. Pouts and does not put its lens out if left in the JEEP overnight in Montana even if it's spring and there's only a light flurry that evening.  I was just getting everything set perfectly (yes, it's taken me 4 years) when the lens quit extending.  It is now a paperweight or doorknob art.  It does still read cards...a plus, for door knob art, I think.  I saw one person whose camera didn't work for them in the winter very well at all, mine worked fine while dog sledding and other great times in Montana and this camera moved from Florida all at once.<br /><br />Shooting it fully automatic as you would with a cheap compact, you miss out on many of the features, not to mention: many good photos from dawn through a dimly lit club in the wee hours~~all without flash.  If you can read the manual, you can work this camera, which has ways to personalize settings without worries as you can always \"return to default\" without concern.<br /><br />Mine enjoyed over exposing when running free on fully automatic in full on daylight.  I wish it would had been better at identifying moving targets and selecting shorter exposures, even in rapid mode.<br /><br />These problems aside, the camera itself is capable of very good photos. Be advised,  this could be a point and shoot, but to get the photos that you really want, decisions must be made!  I don't believe this is for the casual photographer that is only interested in point-and-shoot.  A feel for the basic photography concepts: using aperture or timing priority or fully manual; knowing what effects ISO and exposure compensation, etc.  These will all be explained enough in the manual for you to operate the camera enough to enjoy it, I think. If you know how to use Picasa, the simplest way to add UV filter, I think, you don't even need to buy the proprietary click in version to actually place on the camera to make your photos look more appealing and professional.  Go to go to Irish Gypsy's my space page to see photos ALL taken with this camera.<br /><br />I strongly recommend spending a few hours with the advanced manual and the camera and learning properly how the exposure, white balance and focus controls work. It will really pay off!  What you see on the approximately 1 knuckle length wide by about 1.5 knuckle long display screen will be what you get.  Though it is difficult to see the itsy bitsy screen in bright daylight, this camera really shines in dim light  with help from things like white balance to make sure you don't get the false sepia tone that makes things look so awful in dim light photos and Image Stabilizer mode, which I used even on the tripod, in case I forgot to turn it back on.  Either way, this camera ate batteries like a bear on huckleberries.  My battery recharger is worn out!!  I'll be replacing the camera and the recharge.<br /><br />All in all, worth the cost of purchasing the camera as a first digital camera.  It is bulky, and I did miss out on some great shots because I didn't feel like hauling the camera with me on some particular excursion.  I hope my replacement will take shots as nicely.<br /><br />~~~~~~<br /><br />May I say that I purchased this through here and Amazon does a DARN fine job!!","That's all you need in a simple camera.<br /><br />Compact Flash (the cheapest), NiMH AA batteries (idem), 10x optical zoom.<br /><br />Just missing a macro but, ...","The size isn't very convenient compared to the compact digitals, and the viewing screen is too small.","This camera has a good response time, nice picture quality (as you would expect from a canon), excellent battery life (i use 2500 mAH rechargeable batteries). Low light performance is very good too.","I bought this camera last year and returned it after about two weeks. In some reviews I had read, people mentioned how great it is at outdoor photos but that indoor/dim photos are not the best but I decided to ignore the second part. Most of my photo-ops are inside and none of the pictures I took turned out so great. Just thought I would do a quick warning because I was pretty bummed when I loaded up my pictures onto the computer and saw how poorly they had come out.","I bought this camera last year I'm very satisfied whit it, it's incredible the resolution and good color, saturation and quality of pictures, you must be atention with low light condition but the rest its a great camera very sofisticated and when I have more money I will buy the S2.","I have had this camera for about 2 years now. Before I bought this camera I had a smaller camera with a 3x zoom. I didn't really miss the zoom option on my previous camera but now that I have the 10x zoom on the PowerShot S1 I'm not sure how I could live without it in the past. The camera takes good pictures and it is easy to operate. You can use the predefined modes if you want to..or you can adjust a lot of stuff manually if you are into that :-) The only problems with this camera is size and the lens cap. It is \"big\" and bulky...no, it is not as big as a SLR camera but it is still a bit to bit to stick in your pocket when you are going out on a Friday night. The camera lens keeps falling of all the time and it is not a big problem but from time to time the lens gets dirty due to this problem. I have posted lots of pictures taken with this camera on my homepage (check the profile). All the pictures from the NYC trip and until today is taken with the camera.<br /><br />Conclusion: I would not hesitate to recommend the PowerShot S1 (or the new S2) to people I know :-)","I bought this camera about a year ago to replace an Olympus Camedia C-750 (which was stolen). The camera has exceeded my expectations and is better than the Olympus is many respects.<br /><br />a) The Canon S1 has a much better video mode that records in 2 modes (hi and low resolution) with great sound. Even in low resolution, the video looks good. I can also frame the video by zooming in and out since the 10 times zoom works great while in video mode.<br /><br />b) The stabilizer is great. I have a technique that I use to capture quick shots using only one hand (eg, when skiing or when driving). I'll set the film speed to the highest (ISO 400). I then set it to shutter priority mode (Tv in this camera), and set the shutter at a fast speed--1/400 second or so). I just hold and aim the camera, holding it with one hand,  in the general direction of the action I want to capture, without looking into the view finder to focus, and snap away. The camera's auto focusing unit is fast enough that I've captured very good shots that I would not have been able to capture any other way.<br /><br />The Olympus may have slightly better color and resolution than this camera but not really noticeable in any way that counts (to me at least).<br /><br />I've taken this camera on multiple vacations (bryce and zion canyons in Utah, skiing at Sugarbush and Killington) and it has performed admirably even when I was taking pics in a snow storm (in Sugarbush). I've fallen hard multiple times with the camera in my backpack while attempting moguls on Outer Limits in Killington and it's still working great (better than my knee).<br /><br />Some reviewer mentioned that it came with Photoshop software, but that's not correct. It also does not work in Raw mode, but that is not important to me.<br /><br />For a $250 camera (that's what I paid on Amazon), you can't beat it with a stick.","I think just about everything that can be said about this camera has already been said in other reviews, so I'll just add my four stars to the mix by saying that I've had this camera for about a year and a half and that it has served me very well on trips all over the world as well as closer to home. It takes excellent photos with vibrant color, and of course the 10x zoom is wonderful. There is only one reason why I did not give it five stars, that being that it does not perform well (or at all) in low-light situations. My first digital camera was an Olympus C2100 (also a 10x zoom lens), and it took absolutely outstanding low-light photos. Otherwise the S1 IS is excellent.","This was my first digital camera, so I'm a novice to all this, but I have to say, I love this camera. It's an SLR styled camera, but it's small enough for you to want to take it everywhere. It takes great pictures with amazing color. Don't like color? There's a mode so that you can shoot black and white or sepia. The menu is fairly easy to learn. Though the viewfinder shows a little less than what's actually in the picture, you can see everything that you would on the LCD.<br /><br />Sure the LCD's a little small, but this was my first digital camera, so what do I care? It looks fine to me. Focusing in low light is a problem, but once I'm fully comfortable with the automatic parts, I'll start messing more with the manual focus.<br /><br />This is a great camera even for starters as it offers easy auto shooting, but is intuitive enough to learn on, and to grow to use its full capabiltities.","My pro tools Is the worst company I have ever delt with.... I have the chip I prdered from Amazon they are wonderful but My Pro tools has not let me know my tracking number or anything... They promise the moon and you get bupcuss... I can't even rate the item because I am still waiting and I orderded a new camera and it better not be used!!!!!! I had to put a rating in for a camera I have yet to receive but I wanted to let everyone know not to deal with MY Pro Tools","This camera is a good deal for the price.  You get a lot of features.  However, focusing in lower light seems to be a challenge.  Also, in video mode the focusing is always adjusting.  The zoom is great and otherwise the videos are great.  Pictures are excellent quality.  Would buy again because of all you get at this price.","I've had the S1 IS for about 6 months now and I am very happy with the camera.<br /><br />Positives: Very easy to use; awesome video quality + sound; good picture quality; image stabilization feature seems to work well; nice variety of shooting modes; 10X optical zoom will spoil you; omni positional screen will become a must have for future cameras.<br /><br />Negatives: 3.2 MP is OK, but more is always better, especially if you are going to blow up and/or crop your shots; macro mode would be nice; sometimes camera seems to search too long in mid to low light in auto mode - picture quality can suffer.<br /><br />I've not yet explored even half of the camera's features.  I've been very happy shooting stills mostly in auto mode and video.  Camera can do a lot more if you ask it to.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this camera, or the S2 if you want to spend a bit more for more MPs and other features.  I added a 1 GB flash card and two sets of rechargeable batters, neither of which I could do without.  You'll need at least a 500MB card if you plan to shoot much video.","I bought the Powershot S1 IS in Oct. 2005 to replace my Canon T70 film camera.  I really like this camera, and here is why:<br /><br />1) It has an \"Auto\" mode so that my wife and kids can use it without worrying about flash, f-stops and shutter speeds.  OK, almost all digitals do this.  ;-)<br /><br />2) But, you can change to Program AE, Tv, Av or fully manual mode.  Now we're talkin'!  I'm all for point and shoot ease when it comes to family snapshots, but sometimes I like to get creative with a sunset, moonrise, night shot, fill-flash, silhouette, etc. and this camera can handle it.  It's got up to a 15-second shutter, which is longer than many in this class.<br /><br />3) You can add narration comments to photos, which I find handy when documenting something that the picture alone does not explain.  Like, I do genealogy photos so I want to say who lived there or whose grave marker that was, or whatever.  You can download the comments to the computer as a WAV file as well.  It's like taking notes while you're recording the scene.<br /><br />4) Movie mode is *almost* a replacement for my Sony Digital8 camcorder.  Other than the camcorder recording in stereo and having better low-light sensitivity, the Powershot S1 can handle most of what I use a camcorder for.  Image stabilization and zoom while recording are bonuses in this camera class.<br /><br />5) No lens swapping any more.  With the 10x zoom from 38mm to 380mm, there's no need to carry any lenses with it, although you can get a wider wide angle and a longer telephoto, but why?  If you're that into photography, you should be looking at digital SLRs anyway.<br /><br />6) Vari-angle LCD makes it so much easier to get an angle that you can't when the LCD is attached.  Shoot over your head, from your feet, around a corner...  not many cameras in this class can do that.<br /><br />7) Stitch Assist mode.  OK, this was a feature I liked in particular that you may not care about.  But I like to take panoramas, and with the T70, I was guessing how much overlap I had, what the exposure should be for each shot, etc.  With the Powershot S1, it locks in white balance and exposure on the first frame, then shows you 1/3 of the last frame in the next shot so you can line them up.  I can do hand-held panoramas all day!  :-)<br /><br />OK, so there were a few negatives that I'll share too:<br /><br />1) There's no hot shoe for my Vivitar flash, although you can buy a Canon flash unit for this model.  But I probably won't because I think the built-in ~15 ft. flash range will be all I need.<br /><br />2) Speaking of that... flash pictures that you take from about 5 feet and closer seem to be washed out in the highlights.  That may be because the sensor is reading the dark background and overcompensating.  But you can manually adjust the flash power, which I set to about 1/4 on the scale and that seems to cure the problem for close ups.<br /><br />3) A low-light focusing lamp would help.  I had some trouble on Halloween eve focusing outdoors with natural light.<br /><br />4) I think I like the pre-flash type of red-eye reduction rather than the little LED light that's on this camera.  It doesn't seem to take care of red-eye in all cases (like when people are not looking directly at the camera), but it works OK in most cases.<br /><br />I believe the newer Powershot S2 takes care of some of these issues, but then again, it's almost 2x as expensive at this point in time.<br /><br />When you buy this camera, you will need a case and a memory card for it.  I bought the Tamrac 5693 Digital 3 Bag here on Amazon, which fits the S1, an extra set of batteries, an extra memory card, and the camera's video cable.  I've heard that the Canon PSC-70 bag is on the small side for this camera.  The memory card I bought (here on Amazon again) was the SanDisk SDCFH-512-901 512MB Ultra II CompactFlash Card, which has plenty of space for what I need and is a pretty fast card.<br /><br />One other thing you'll probably want to buy is some NiMH batteries.  I didn't have a charger either, so I bought a package of 8 2500ma Energizer batteries and a nice Powerex MH-C204W charger for about $50 at [...]<br /><br />I came away with this whole setup for about $375, which I think was a great deal and well worth the convenience and quality that I got.  I considered the Panazsonic Lumix DMC-FZ4 too, but I liked the Canon features and the fact that it used cheaper AA batteries and CF card.  So the big 35mm bag sits in my closet now and this little camera goes everywhere with me.","i love the way this camera feels in my hands: like a real SLR camera.  it's also got enough weight that i don't feel like it's going to blow away with the slightest breeze.  it's just a tad on the large side, not really fitting into a pocket, but it fits alright into an average sized purse.  the options for additional acessories are wonderful, including extra lenses and a waterproof case.  the LCD screen is incredibly cool. when not using the camera, the screen protects itself from unwatned fingerprints or dust, but when you want to use it, it flips out, turns around (which allows you to take pictures of yourself and friends if no one is there to hold the camera) but once turned around, the screen also flips back in, allowing you to use it as you would any old screen.  (that might just be my favorite feature--it's the little things).  this was one of consumer reports favorites for people who like to shoot snapshots, but also occasionally like to get a little creative, and that fit me to a tee.  although pricey, i feel like this camera is worth every penny.","We picked up this camera as a replacement for our lost Nikon Coolpix 3100.  We'd been really happy with the 3100, and we'd read a lot of professional reviews of available cameras before settling on this one.  A lot of people liked it, so we figured it was a good bet for us.<br /><br />At first, though, it was frustrating; the camera seemed to struggle with focus indoors, and we weren't able to get it to take many good pictures.  For the first half an hour, I wondered if it would just be better to return it and go for another camera.<br /><br />However, that's first impression; and I was used to a little point and shoot camera.  Once you get used to this one, though, you find that it's much more capable; and the problems it has are mostly things you can get around.<br /><br />Firstly, the focus in low light.  There are a number of ways around it - firstly, the manual focus combines with the autofocus pretty well.  I was able to get some pretty sharp results out of this the very first time I tried it, using the camera at full zoom in not great lighting.  Secondly, you can use some of the little camera tips (focusing on similar-distance objects that the camera can pick out better - a little backward as a solution, but it works pretty well) and finally, because the camera lets you configure a custom shooting mode yourself, you can set up a hyperfocus mode.  A lot of people using this camera have found that a decent hyperfocus setting all but wipes out the camera's struggles with focusing in low-light, allowing it to work well as an indoor point-and-shoot camera.<br /><br />The next issue is the screen size - but honestly, I don't have a problem with it at all, probably because it's the same size as our old camera had.  On top of that, the screen is a decent resolution, it's clear and much brighter than the screen on our old camera, and the fact that you can tilt and flip it means you can take pictures from just about any angle or position you can dream of.  If you want to take a picture with the camera close to the ground, just flip the screen out and angle it upwards; and if you want to take pictures of yourself, flip the screen around.  No more guesswork, and no more pulled muscles and twisted necks trying to take tricky pictures!<br /><br />The other features add together to make this camera wonderful, especially at the price.  The video mode is great - 30 frames a second, 640 by 480 pixels with good sound recording to boot, though you'll want a fast memory card to use it, and the video clips come out as fairly hefty AVI files.  The 10x zoom is nice to have too - you can take pictures you were never able to before.  Image stabilization, too, works a treat - and the battery life is wonderful.<br /><br />Basically, this camera has traded megapixel resolution for features and versatility, and I think it's more than worth it.  3.2mp seems small in today's market, but it's still a good resolution; far more than is needed for web pictures, and plenty to produce crisp 5x7\" prints.  And with the other features that this camera has, the pictures you'll be able to take will simply be better than those you could have taken with a higher mp, but less capable camera.<br /><br />In the end, it's a little less accessible than the simpler point-and-shoot cameras at first, but it's very rewarding once you get to grips with it.  Definitely worth getting, and definitely worth sticking with.<br /><br />(Update - after almost a year of use, we still really like this camera.  Its quality for general photography is great, and the quality of videoclips it can takes are more than good enough to put onto a DVD.  However, we've missed the quick response of our old little camera sometimes - there are certain situations where our old Nikon was faster and much easier to handle, and for very close-up photography, the lack of resolution means you're a little limited.  But as an all-round camera, it's still been a great one, and still deserving the full five stars for the price.)","This is a great camera. I bought it just prior to a trip to Russia and quickly learned its many features. I continued to learn about more features as I used it on this trip. Great photos and easy to use 10X zoom allowed me to capture all the sights with little or no training. I bought a SanDisk 512 memory card and can record several hundred photos. I reviewed my photos at the end of each day and deleted the poor shots from the camera. I also bought a ($14) camera bag, 4 rechargeable AA batteries with charger ($10) at Walmart that works great. I use Picasa2, free photo edit software, abd now I am good-to-go. You will love this camera. I previously used a Epson PC600 digital camera $600 and there is no comparison - this camera MUCH better, but 6 years has elapsed.<br /><br />Luck,<br /><br />Vince LaPorte<br /><br />Marshall, MN","This camera has been a lot of fun.  The flip screen is very convenient.  The flash and zoom is incredible.  However, this camera is rather bulky and almost impossible to put in a purse.  This camera is worth its money.","The Canon S1 IS Powershot is an easy to use point and shoot camera with plenty of capabilities that I have yet to master.<br /><br /> The zoom (10x optical, 32x digital)is fantastic, I have taken quite good pictures of the moon and some landscapes. Image stabilization is also a great feature that will help with long zooms and low light conditions, although it won't work sometimes properly for full moon shots or very intense sources of light.<br /><br />The function buttons on the camera are well placed (ergonomic)<br /><br />The LCD monitor, although smaller (1.5 inches) than in other digital cameras swivels and you can flip it around and keep it closed for protection when not in use.<br /><br />The Canon Powershot S1 IS only has 3.2 megapixels, but as other reviewers have said this is compensated by the 10x optical zoom (38-380mm in a 35mm equivalent)<br /><br />The camera includes a 32MB Compact Flash memory card-not internal memory- and uses 4 AA alkaline batteries.  Regarding this two aspects I recommend to get a bigger compact flash memory card (at least 128MB, 256MB desirable) and rechargable batteries since common AA alkaline batteries will not last long (no more than 30-40 shots)<br /><br />Despite its minor limitations this camera with plenty of functions will help you to take great portraits, landscapes, night shots, sports, ( with a powerful zoom, and an image stabilizer.) With  its superb optics the  Canon S1 IS Powershot Camera is a great buy, so if you are a casual photographer on a budget that want to take great pictures, this is the camera for you.","Still need to learn how to use it; but simple trials gave quite good results.","Esta camara no por ser de 3.1 MP es de baja calidad,es una camara con todas las caracteristicas de una camara de mayor precio, para quien no se dedica a impresiones de gran formato como los publicistas, es ocioso mas megapixeles, seria como comprar un yate para navegar en una alberca.","The size of this product isn't quite as huge as you'd like to believe, it's just about 3/4 the size of a CD.  It's not very heavy until the batteries go in but it's pretty much worth it.  It's not something you'd want to do heavy duty work with, as in the abuse your regular little disposable camera would get.  This camera would be ideal if you're going somewhere where you can keep it safely cushioned such as a wedding or something that I do like busfanning.<br /><br />The optical zoom is excellent and pictures that you take are very clear, and the IS or image stabilizer works very well in conjunction.  However, if you zoom in all the way (10x) and you shake the camera, the picture does come out blurry.<br /><br />There are many little tricks that this camera comes with, all too confusing sometimes if you don't know what it all means, and always need to have the manual nearby.<br /><br />But yes, overall, this camera is really nice, and getting it from amazon was the best at getting the \"bang for my buck.\"  If you're looking for something that zooms well, and the IS that stops all your blurries, then this is a good camera for you.","I received this camera for my birthday a few weeks ago, and I could not be happier.  It is my first digital camera and it is so easy to use!  And, of course, it takes wonderful pictures.  The image stabilizer is my favorite part of it, because I have a baby niece, and, of course, it is very hard to get her to stay still long enough to snap a picture.  All in all, a very great camera!","I have had 4 digital cameras in the past 6 years and this one is the best so far. I had the tiny cameras which have their place but I do like the feel of this big camera. People actually are impressed by the look of it. The pictures are great but the focus is a little tricky in dark conditions. The 10x zoom works great and the movies are wonderful. It has more features and functions then you could possible need for your everyday photographer. I would buy another one!","The PowerShot takes quick pics, gives you lots of photo options and its styling and engineering is impressive. As with any good camera, the owner needs to practice and learn what it can do and how to adjust for possible problems. I find that the auto-focus, for example, is good in most circumstances, but you get better results in low-light and back-lit situations when that feature is turned off. A lot of camera for the price. 4 stars plus.","Having 10x zoom has changed the way I take pictures.  You can take pictures of things that most people dont even notice!  The flip screen is also really useful for taking pictures in crowds, or strange angles.  The only time this camera has problems is in low light conditions.  If you are planning on taking a lot of pictures at parties you may want to look for something else, it has some trouble focusing in these indoor/low light conditions.  Besides that it's practically perfect.  Get a huge card for it if you plan on taking lots of videos (the video quality is my favorite part of the camera).  I have a 1GB card, but I wish I had gotten a bigger one because you can only take about 11 minutes of high quality video.  I'm looking into a 4GB card, I think thats the biggest the camera can handle.","I bought this camera when my daughter was born because I wanted both the zoom feature and the ability to take video clips.  The first is impressive, and the second is adequate for my needs - but the included 32MB CF card is a throw-away; even at 320x240 resolution, the camera's AVI format gobbles megabytes fast.<br /><br />The still image quality is pretty good, sharp enough for 8x10 prints.  I am a bit disappointed with the auto exposure - flash pictures tend to wash out, and it's not very good in low light.  It is also annoyingly slow to auto focus, especially on close-ups, and fails to lock in on many shots. The camera's manual focus feature is too cumbersome to be of any use.  A focus ring would be a vast improvement.  This is still a very nice camera with an impressive array of features for the price.  But if you want professional results, bite the bullet and buy a professional camera.","I'm station in Iraq and have entirley way too much time on my hands.  I decided I needed a hobby and bought the Canon S1.  This camara is everything I expected and more.  I bought a 1GB memory card with it (highly recomended) and have taken countless pictures (well over 6,000).  The Image Stability works very well and the 10X zoom always comes in handy (and keeps me out of harms way).  I have also used it to take video and was amazed by the quality that it gives.  I can not belive what an amazing camara this has turned out to be.  My only complaints are the Pop Up Flash (it dosnt alwas pop up on its own) and the lens cap dos'nt like to stay on. The batteries go quick but it all depends on your shooting habbits. These are minor complaints and in fact althought I have only owned the camara for maybe 4 months I have already purchased the S2 and am anxiously awaiting its arival.","GOT THIS FOR 249.00 AND GLAD I DID DOES EVERY THING BETTER THAN I IMAGINED.DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS CAMERA.","The other reviews sums it up. This camera is just awesome for a Point and Shoot enthusiast who is advanced enough to just venture into the manual settings world. This is a great camera for the price. THe pictures comes out just great. The Image Stabilization works (for real!!). My wife (who is not a very photo enthusiast) too a few snaps while we were driving at 80mph through Montana. I couldn't believe that the pictures came out without any shake!<br /><br />Not wasting your time further ... just buy this camera - it's a great price too!","This camera has a great zoom capability and produces clear, sharp pics and great video!  I love this little guy!","This camera is by far the best I've used.  I love it!  Great clarity and great pictures!","I was looking for a combination of high optical zoom, low weight, long battery life, and fast shutter cycle time.  I found them all in the Canon S1IS - and all at a price remarkably close to what I paid for my Canon A60, a much lower-end camera.<br /><br />The movable display is a great feature - you can keep it closed, so the LCD doesn't get scratched, or you can open it and rotate it so you can see it from a variety of angles.<br /><br />Only a couple of downsides I'd grumble about: 1) the lens cap doesn't stay on as well as I'd like - it's easy to bump it and have it come off, and 2) the viewfinder is electronic, so following a fast-moving scene, or one in low light, is tough.  But that's been a very small concern for me.","It is an excellent camera compared to others with the same price. Fast shipped.","I got this as my second digital because I wanted the zoom and I wanted to begin to learn how to do things manually.<br /><br />This camera has been great.  I've taken hundreds of pictures so far and having both automatic and manual modes is wonderful as sometimes you just want to pull it out and shoot.<br /><br />It is also great for the price as I didn't want to get a camera that would cost more than my rent and didn't see the point in spending that much as I am a beginner anyways.<br /><br />I carry it everywhere with me and although it isn't as small as my other digital it will still fit in my cargo pants pockets very easily.<br /><br />My only warning on it though is that it does not focus well on macro shots, but that could also be a user fault and not with the camera.  Like I said I'm a beginner.<br /><br />Another great feature is that the lens cap is snug enough that it doesn't fall off in my pocket but when I forget to take it off it pops off without stressing the lens motor.  Wonderful for those of us who get too excited about a shot or are just absent minded.<br /><br />Anyways, there are some comparable cameras to this one and I researched them all and am not dissapointed with my decision one bit.<br /><br />Happy shooting to you.","Great Camera!  IS Zoom is amazing! In auto mode zoomed in on an airplane flying overhead; the lettering on the side of the aircraft actually are visible! Night shots and daylight filtered exceed every expectation. Too many awesome features to list.  The auto mode is so smart I don't think I'll ever need the manual modes. Wish it was a little lighter.","This is my first dig cam. I have had it for two months now and am satisfied by the performance. It is a good camera for beginners and has lot more options and controls than other cameras at the same price range.<br /><br />+ + + 1. IS works really well.<br /><br />  2. Videos are very nice.<br /><br />  3. Ultrasonic motor is nice.<br /><br />- - - 1. Images are generally soft<br /><br />  2. Lot of noise at higher ISO","I think this is a fabulous camera for the price. I've had a great time playing with the zoom, and I love that so many functions, like shutter speed, are adjustable. This is my third digital camera. My first two were Sony cybershots, and even though they were more expensive, this is definitely my favorite. I was a little concerned about downgrading to a 3 MP camera (my last sony was a 5 MP) but to be perfectly honest, the pictures coming out of my Canon S1 are crystal clear, although I haven't tried to make any huge enlargements and I really don't intend to. Why buy more than you need?","Its a really great camera. I just the turning on and off mechanism were a little more easier, you have push a little thing and turn the camera switch on/off. If that could be improved. Also, it does suck up a lot of battery really quick! Overall its a great buy for the price. Keep the good stuff coming Canon.","Great camera for the price. Many options to grow with. Batteries go pretty fast though, rechargebles are a good idea.","Quick pictures, nice photos day or night, so far no complaints.","The Canon PowerShot S1 is a fabulous camera. It is my second Canon PowerShot. I recently took this camera to Disneyland and it easily took pictures of fast moving rides in bright sunlight AND pictures of the amazing 50th anniversary fireworks display. This camera takes good automatic images but its real strength lies in everything you can customize. You can manually set the aperture, exposure, shutter speed, and even the white balance. I highly recommend this camera.","Very nice Camera.  Plenty of zoom and the snout of the camera isn't really that big.  Almost no fuzzy pictures with this baby.  3.2mp might be a little slow for some but I just send all of my pics to the local Wal-Mart for prints and it works just fine for me.  I've sent one in for an 8X10 and it looked very nice to us when it came back.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and throw away that dinky 16meg compact flash memory that they send you and go out and buy some ultra2 compact flash memory.  It speeds up the operational speed of the camera tremendously, however it still takes forever compared to my old Canon A75.<br /><br />Overall I have no regrets buying it.","This camera I take with me on extended canoe and kayak trips.With only 3.2 MP, I can still have plenty of memory space to get away with only one card along.Also,and even more important,usuing 4 AA batterys,I have plenty of power available for long periods of time.The 10X lens,allows me to get pretty far out with my shots,and am still able to have picture quality left over to blow up enough for my enlargements.I very seldom get over 8 X 10,and this camera suits me for this and all other respects.Looks at first too complex, but is very well organized for operation after limited practice.Very-very satisfied","This new camera is very easy to use, even my three year old is enjoy taking pictures with this camera. I would recommend this one to anyone who is new to digital cameras. Aside from the fact the it is user friendly it also takes great pictures.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the Cannon all around.","This camera is everything I hoped it would be.  Unless you're blowing up poster size prints, this is all the camera you will ever need.  The 10x optical gives extremely crisp full zoom pics and even with full digital zoom (32x) the pics still look pretty good.  It is bulkier and heavier than my powershot A60 (which is also a great camera), but the extra pixels and super zoom make the larger package worth the effort to drag it around.  I couldn't believe the quality of the video that I took in existing light at night time.  With my 512mb card, I can use the S1 as a digital camcorder and it is certainly a lot smaller and lighter than a camcorder.  Canon's versatility from simple point and shoot to professional custom characteristics make it an ideal camera for almost anyone and lots cheaper than other super zoom cams.","I took this camera on vacation and it took GREAT pictures.  The only flaw with this camera is the small LCD screen.","Keep in mind that you'd be ponying up less than $300 clams for this baby.  3.2 MP is more than enough - I've used this camera for 1 year now and it's everything and more.  I've taken great photos and I'm no whiz at this stuff.  Sure the 3.2MP seems low, but it's more than enough for your 8 X 10 photos and you're getting a Canon lens that is tremendous.  Canon optics are the best in my humble opinion for regular joe consumers like me.<br /><br />10X zoom with IS is a great function to have at such a decent price.  The zoom is very quiet and quick whereas some cameras make that whirring sound and you wind-up hearing it when you take movies.  Canon basically put same zoom drive that it puts in its higher end cameras into this one.<br /><br />One feature that is great is the LCD screen can move out of its solid camera body which is a great feature considering it allows you to take shots at different angles like when you are in a crowded area.  You wind-up using that feature a lot.<br /><br />Max of 1 GB capacity for Compact flash cards which is OK but ideally you might want more if you were to shoot short movies fairly frequently.  Movies are of very good quality - no complaints although I rarely do them.<br /><br />Only negative is lens cap falls off which is a bit annoying. And the bag is a bit lame - very chintzy.  And the Canon logo on the camera strap peeled off fairly quickly.<br /><br />Another great thing is that you can buy a waterproof case for $150 which is a great add-on.  Many other accessories to this too.<br /><br />All in all, for the price, you are getting a camera loaded with features and excellent build quality and a Canon lens which makes a huge difference in pic quality.  If not the S1, consider the S2 or the upcoming S3 as this line of cameras is top-notch.","Canon's done a great think with this product. This AA-ready, 10x-zoom product from a highly reputable camera manufacturer is a *highly*-recommended option for the serious amateur photographer. All in all, this camera is a GREAT value. If all consumer electronics companies held themselves up--for every product they made--to the basic dependability, overall ease of use, and impressive versatility of this camera, we'd all be in a much more affordable and hassle-free world relative to our mobile phones, DVRs, MP3 players, computers (especially), and everything else that sometimes beeps, whirrs, or flashes in our lives!<br /><br />If you're a \"point and shoot\" kind of photographer, however, move on: this PowerShot S1 is far more feature-rich, large, and heavier than you'll want.<br /><br />My review is based on 8 months of use. Heaven forbid that it stops working properly anytime soon--or even anytime within the next 5 years--but, thus far, I'm impressed. The camera accompanied me from the U.S. on a wintertime trip to England at the end of 2004 where it got a thorough workout and a great deal of manhandling, and held up through the entire vacation (and since then) solidly.<br /><br />*FEATURES: Manual over-ride exists for every key element: aperture, ISO speed (only a 50 to 400 range, however), flash, and even focus. Other features I find myself using a lot include switching the timer from 2 second delay (when I don't need to run in front of the camera to get into the photo myself) and 10 second delay (when I do), and over-riding the flash--that is, setting it from AUTO to ON, so that it will act as a \"fill flash\" even when the light meter is reading that the scene is bright because of background light. (There are two or three features I'll never use actually--and which I find rather silly, frankly--like \"sepia\" mode. Whatever.)<br /><br />*I.S.: Image stabilization is solid--not extra-ordinary, but good.<br /><br />*BATTERY: I have not had problems with battery depletion simply because I did what I'd recommend you do, too, if considering this product. I bought a AA recharger that I also cannot recommend highly enough (the \"Sony Power Charger with 4 Ni-MH AA Batteries\"--purchased via Amazon at the same time I purchased the Canon PowerShot) and 4 additional rechargeable AA's at my local K-Mart. So, as I shot, I simply kept 4 charged batteries at hand to swap in for the 4 temporarily exhausted ones if needed. I was never at *any* point without the ability to take photos for want of power. And then I recharged batteries, if needed or desired, during the night. Regardless, I found that 4 batteries lasted through *hundreds* of images with the camera set at the ideal setting for 4\"x6\" prints (150 dpi, I suspect, but I'm not sure off-hand), and in normal temperatures (more on that below).<br /><br />NOTE: far too many digital cameras require special batteries, sometimes proprietary (like Kodak for one). Setting aside the issue of batteries being rechargeable, the simple fact that this PowerShot takes AA's is fantastic. It means you will never have a difficult time finding power for your camera...as long as you're not far from \"civilization.\"<br /><br />NOTE: *Temperature* affects battery life to a surprising extent. I'm aware that cold temperature can affect battery life, but the PowerShot seems particularly sensitive to this. When shooting outside in England in December, keeping that second set of 4 AA's was very important. Four AA's alone would not have been enough. However, indoors or at regular temps in spring, summer, and autumn, 4 batteries--especially those manufactured for use in digital electronic goods--will be adequate.<br /><br />*VIDEO/AUDIO: I only took 3 video clips on my trip. My sense is that this is what drains battery life; it certainly drains memory. Nonetheless, I considered the video feature \"icing on the cake,\" and didn't care about it much anyway. So, I was very pleasantly surprised when I played back my video clips on my computer and encountered not only a very clear image which demonstrated the camera's ability in video mode to zoom and refocus fast, but also audio that seemed neither muffled nor--the other extreme possibility--\"tinny.\"<br /><br />(One word of commonsense advice though on using the video mode. Don't speak loudly or at all when you're the shooter, because the microphone will pick up your voice very well due to your proximity to the microphone, and in play-back you'll be roaring compared to all the other sound. I can even hear myself breathing in the playback!)<br /><br />*INTERFACE: The interface of this camera was designed fairly well considering the wide range of options and features. It's got lots of buttons and lots of options, so ***practice*** with this camera before you use it for some special event or vacation, etc. Canon seems to have correctly anticipated which features people will want to over-ride or mess with the most (such as turning the flash to ON, OFF, or AUTO) and separated those buttons from the rest, which is helpful.<br /><br />*COLOR: I have not encountered color distortion when viewing images digitally. I have printed out very few images, since I put images online mostly, so I cannot yet review how the PowerShot's images translate color-wise when printed. Of course, the printer one uses affects the quality and color-correctness of prints, too.<br /><br />*WT/SIZE/FEEL: This camera is totally SLR-esques in feel and heft, though it's more compact than an SLR. I'm happy with the camera's feel. Its size would be difficult to make much smaller given current limits to technology, unless one sacrificed the basic SLR-like mold of the camera. I was able to get this camera completely into the pocket of my winter jacket--I never while in England needed a bag, case, or carrier for it. It will not, however, fit into a typical coat pocket--like on a light jacket, a suit coat, etc. It will fit into a normal purse, I'm sure, but not a small handbag.<br /><br />It *is* heavy, however. That is one thing to note that is a negative. But, along with that heft, I feel, comes better control and stability.<br /><br />There are a few little niggling things about the camera's menus that annoy me, 10x zoom is good, but often not enough for me, and the lens cap doesn't stay on very well (but, it's attached to a camera by a shot nylon cord, so you *won't* lose the cap!), and when I think about these negatives I'm tempted to give the camera 4 stars, not 5; but, there are so many other strong positives with the PowerShot S1 relative to the FUNDAMENTALS of camera use and design--plus a competitive (though not \"low\") price--that I realize the negatives are ultimately minor. If \"4 1/2\" was an option, I suppose I'd give the product that rating.<br /><br />That said, I'll rate this camera \"5 stars\" as an excellent product for the dedicated amateur photographer.","Good pictures, lots of features. Really like it, but the batteries cost a lot and only last a month!!!!","For those reviewers complaining that the camera does not imprint the date/time on the image except when printing, please note that the date and time the image was taken and many other technical details are included in the EXIF data embedded in the JPEG image.  To view this information in Microsoft Windows XP, right-click the image, choose Properties, and look at the \"Date Picture Taken\" on the Summary tab.<br /><br />I intend to purchase the Canon PowerShot S2 IS when it is released at the end of June 2005.  I have been very happy with the three Canon point and shoot digital cameras I have owned.  Picture quality is excellent, and the Canon menu system is comprehensive and easy to use.<br /><br />The S1 IS does not include an autofocus assist lamp to help focus in low light situations.  I like making 8x10 inch prints, and three megapixels does not provide enough resolution for a full-quality print at that size.","I bought this camera about a month ago after researching about a hundred different cameras. I was looking for something aroun 4-5 megapixels and $200-$300. This camera had lower megapixels (3.2) and it was at the top of my limits. I have one thing to say:<br /><br />I am glad I bought it.<br /><br />I received the camera in a matter of days from Amazon. That was normal for any order that I have placed with Amazon. Fast service. I received it just a few days before we left for a vacation to Disneyland in California so I did not have time to mess with it much, but I had time to play around with some of the features on the way down and I am impressed with this camera. I took pictures from day to night and from stills to shooting scenery out of our vehicle going 85 mph. Oops, I meant 75 mph officer. I would say that 99% of them came out great. I turned the video resolution down to the next one lower. A 512 MB CF card held about 12 minutes of video in one continuous shoot. That is probably the one feature that sold me on this camera. It did not have a limit on the minutes of continous video that could be shot. Other cameras had a 1.5-3 minute limit. I even used it to record half of a speech that I gave to a group to see how I presented myself. The camera was about 10 feet away and it still picked up my voice.<br /><br />The included AA alkaline batteries went dead within about a couple of hours. I bought two sets of rechargeables and found that one set lasted from 8 am to 10 pm at Disneyland. And I took alot of pictures and video! One day, I filled two 512 MB CF Cards and one 256 MB card. That is my only suggestion with this camera. Buy rechargeable batteries and a larger CF card if you are going to shoot video. I am planning to buy a 1 GB CF card later.<br /><br />When I bought it, I had the intention of selling it on ebay if I did not like it. No way. I am keeping it. Oh...one other thing in my favor, my daughter-in-law works as a photographer. She could show me things that camera would do that would have taken me quite awhile to figure out. She had a chance to use it and she was impressed with it.","I will be brief.  This is a great camera but it does not have the date/time stamp option which I took for granted as being available on all newer digital cameras.  My previous camera had it and for me it is a very important feature.  After all, we look back on photos for the memories they bring and knowing the date (and/or time) that the picture was taken is VERY important to me.","I have had my Canon for about a year now.  It is great.  I use the movie function a lot.  This camera takes great movies for a camera this size.  It is big for a regular photo camera but it takes great photos too.  At 10x optical zoom the image stabilizer helps out.  I dropped this camera in the mud a few weeks ago and it still works great. I was worried that the lense would get stuck but after wiping it down, it has no problems.  I bought a 1 GB card so that I can get more video time.<br /><br />If you don't mind the size and think you will take a lot of videos as well as pictures this is the camera for you.","This beauty is brilliant! The body style is ergonomically pleasing and lightweight, the overall design is simple to use, it will satisfy a novice and professional alike, and the pictures are beautiful! Even the manual is well designed. My long search for the perfect camera finally came to an end.<br /><br />When I first took this camera out of the box I was in love with the design. Weight is important to me, and this camera balances beautifully. It's extremely lightweight and easy to grip. Obviously, a lot of engineering went into the body style. After trying out a myriad of cameras that fit my hand clumsily, this one fit like a glove. The only drawback is that it's meant to be gripped with the right hand, so it could take some adjusting for lefties. Otherwise, it's an ergonomic 10 out of 10.<br /><br />The overall design of camera options leads the pack. It won't take long to master the operation of this camera. The most used options have their own buttons, so you don't have to wade through menus all the time. It is loaded with features, and sometimes this makes a camera hard to master for a novice. Not with this one! If you want a point and shoot camera that you can set and forget, this camera is for you. If you are a hobbyist or pro who wants the ability to easily switch from automatic to manual operation, this camera won't disappoint. It is also a camera that can grow with you. With a ton of add-ons and interchangeable lenses, you won't have to shell out money for a new camera as your skills improve. The zoom is more than you get with most cameras, and having a viewfinder is a must if you like to shoot outdoors in bright light. There's even a vision adjustment on the viewfinder. You may have read criticism of the lens cap. If you read the manual, you will see that it's meant to attach to the neck strap, so you really don't have to worry about losing the cap as some reviews state. I would prefer, however, a more secure snap on cover.<br /><br />As we all know, the proof is in the pictures, and Canon is still delivering the goods. I immediately set out to shoot a little bit of everything. In my opinion, one of the hardest shots to get perfect with point and shoot is indoors at night with inconsistent ambient lighting. I used the low light option on the dial, and I was really impressed. The shots I took were very evenly lit and the flash hadn't overexposed my subjects. I took a picture of an outdoor scene through an indoor window using the zoom. The picture looked like it had been shot outdoors rather than from inside. I took a picture during the day in a well lit room with no flash and it was beautiful.<br /><br />If you buy this camera, do yourself a favor and spend an hour going through the manual. You will find out how easy it is to control the many options, so you will be more apt to use them. I even liked the manual design. There are separate manuals in Spanish and English, so you can dispose of the one you don't need.<br /><br />I know I will be happy with this camera for years to come. Some of Canon's cameras have become legendary in the photo world and still have an active life on Ebay years after their retirement. I believe this is one of those cameras.","This is a very nice digital camera.  I am very pleased so far, I will be going on a trip in about a month, I'll give an update.<br /><br />The only reason I don't give this camera 5 stars is:  it does not have a FOCUS ASSIST LIGHT.  And also I'm not finding a \"macro mode\".<br /><br />Does anyone out there know if this camera has a macro mode??  If so, I would love to hear from you. sswaney@uusd.net","I want to add this to my review..it is the manual online. Great for when you cannot find the book. So easy to find in favorites.<br />[...]<br /><br />This is a bit bigger camera than I am used to, but it is a small trade off for the perks....<br />While chasing anyone of my 10 grand kids around DisneyLand two weeks ago. The 10x zoom saved me from the familiar yell...\"wait for Grama\", I simply zoomed in and got shots from yards away that were wonderful. Spontaneous. No one, two, three, CHEESE.......<br /><br />And with the Stabilizer my shaky hands were no trouble any longer.<br />Action is caught and frozen in mid air...clear, in focus.<br />I stood next to the fast water slide waiting for my family to shoot out and down the falls in the raft.<br /> (There is a slight hesitation to the S1 IS between shots. But once you get used to it's timing, no problem)<br />...Those shots of the family on that raft as they flew screaming past me - turned out clear and in focus.<br />I had it on Automatic on a gray day.  I mention this picture due to the speed they were traveling. And it was me at the camera button..............Slo Mo......Amazing camera!!<br /> I am totally amazed and  thrilled at the quality of action pictures and zoom ability  I have been getting with this PowerShot S1 IS 3.2 MP Digital with 10x Image Stabilized Zoom.<br />I have a few of my zoomed in pictures here in the Gallery to look at. The Bee on the Poppy is over 7' away from me. Notice his shadow on the flower.","The Camera is good and have taken some good pictures with it, does whatevr is promised. But what i mainly want to say is when something goes wrong u will get little support from Canon. I find that really BAD, i was totally disappointed and i have decided not to buy any canon product in the future just for the reason that they have poor customer service.<br /><br />Also one more thing before buying This Camera you have to be aware of is that this camera is extremely sensitive to water.... even the slightest amount can screw This camera up completely and Water Damage is not covered by Canon Warranty.<br /><br />i had been on a trip to sea world, i had it in a waterproof bag all the time, but i guess some water got into it when i was trying to get some snaps of shamu..... well that was the end of my honeymoon with canon.....it stopped working.... and i had to struggle so much just to get in touch with \"rude\" customer representatives.<br /><br />And once i sent my camera they took 2 weeks to respond and tell me what was wrong with my camera... and then i had to pay almost half the price of the camera for repair!!!!!! and i got the camera back after another week..... by the way even the shipping and handling has to be borne by you..... and one more thing you should know is that canon though it sells products all over USA has only ONE service center for the entire United States. This too i find unbelievable.<br /><br />So if you are looking for gud customer service i would say dont go for canon.","I will spare everyone the technical details that seem to get repeated on just about every review.  I have had this camera for a few months now and overall I am very happy with it.  The first thing that I can complain about is the autofocus in dim light.  This doesn't seem like it would have been difficult to remedy before production.  The second thing is the fact that it does seem to overexpose pictures when using the flash in Auto mode.  If you are taking pictures with good lighting then this camera is great.  I have used most of the features and like them all.  I would reccommend this to just about anyone.  The price is great for the feature set.  If anyone has any tips on improving the exposure with the flash I would appreciate any tips.  Thanks and hopefully this helps<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />swivel view finder<br /><br />zoom<br /><br />software<br /><br />price<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />autofocus in poorly lit areas<br /><br />overexposure when using flash","The Powershot S1 has all the features of my old Canon A60, but the 10x zoom with image stabilizer sold me. No more blurred photos! The diopter on the viewfinder is another unique feature that this bi-focaled person appreciates. Adjust it to your vision and images are focused perfectly in the viewfinder. The LCD screen can be flipped in different positions, which is handy.  Bonus: fold it down to keep it from getting scratched and full of fingerprints. It's a tad smaller than I'm accustomed to, but suffices.  The pop-up flash is handy, and again, is less likely to get damaged when down. The lens cap, when tethered to the neckstrap, pops right off when you turn the camera on. No more losing lens caps or getting the lens dirty and scratched. (Yes, I'm tough on my cameras.)<br /><br />The 3.2 MP size is perfectly suited to 8x10 or smaller photos. You don't need more than that for casual or semi-professional use. The 32 MB memory card is adequate, but purchase a 512 MB compactflash card and you are set.  Yes, it eats batteries, but purchase a set of rechargeable batteries and charger and you are set to go. I even bought an inverter for my car so that I can plug in the charger when on trips. The video feature is nice, but we use it rarely.<br /><br />The biggest selling points, for me, were:<br />- Canon brand; reliable and well-built, good customer service<br />- Compactflash memory; inexpensive and easy to find<br />- uses AA batteries, not a proprietary battery<br />- 10x zoom; get those close-up shots you can't get with a 3x<br />- image stabilizer; people with shaky hands love this<br />- Flip out LCD view screen<br />- easy-to-use menus and controls<br />- many settings available on top dial<br />- manual focus available when in low-light<br />- ability to add on wide-angle and telephoto lenses and filters<br />- optional remote control<br />- quiet operation; zoom and shutter not noisy like the A60<br />- tripod mount on bottom<br />- unit is not too bulky or heavy and fits in most camera bags<br />- best features for digital camera in this price range<br />[...]","I've owned several Sony Digital Camera's and this is the first Canon that I have ever bought.  The unit is slightly bulkier than my past cameras but the performance with respect to the zoom, color and clarity make it all worth it!  The Image Stabilization feature is the best.  No more blurred pictures!<br /><br />The zoom feature is nice as well.  Great close up shots! Very easy to operate.<br /><br />The swivel screen is also another awesome feature. I can flip the screen over so I don't have to worry about it getting scratched.  It is relatively easy to use.  The only change I would make in the design of the camera is the location of the \"set\" and \"menu\" buttons.  It is placed in a location that is where you would most likely hold the camera.  It is easy to hit the button accidentally while you are trying to take a picture.  Otherwise, this camera is definitely one of the best I've owned and worth the price!","I purchased this camera mainly because of the Image Stabilization feature. Unfortunately, that is the only feature that this camera has that is better than an Olympus C-Series. I also own a Nikon D1X and find it to be easier to navigate than this camera. This camera does NOT have MACRO mode and it does NOT shoot in RAW format. The product specifications listed on the Amazon site are WRONG. I contacted Canon directly to be sure. The camera gets great shots at max zoom IF it can bring the shot into focus - something that doesn't happen often. I have owned the Olympus C700, C740, C750 and C770. All of them have more features and are easier to navigate. Additionally, I would think a camera of this calibur would use Lithium batteries instead of AA's. Given a choice, I would purchase an Olympus C Series for amateur photography or the Nikon D1X for the professional photographer.","To be brief:<br /><br />Wonderful lens!  Loss of contrast and other second=order optical aberrations at zoom extremes are minor, and still allow remarkable pix for a 3MP point-&-shoot unit!<br /><br />BUT, you only get good pix if it's focused.<br /><br />It is among the worst I've seen in medium-low-light auto-focus ability.<br /><br />It was seem fortunate that it has a rather full-featured manual focus ability, but that function (manual focus) is so cumbersome to use it's ultimately not much help.<br /><br />I concentrate on wildlife, and shoot at extreme zoom focal lengths, usually in late afternoon when illumination is rosy but not abundant.  But unless the light is bright, and with high-contrast subjects, the camera hunts and, about half of the time, misses focus by a mile.  Not good.<br /><br />On the good side, this camera is so conveniently sized to fit the hand, so well-equipped with a solid aray of amateur features, with such a remarkable lens and the IS system to boot, I thought it would save me the expense of buying a D-SLR.  But the focus problems destroys that, and I now realize that the lack of the EVF's and small-ish display's abilities to display sufficient resolution to confirm focus at shoot-time, I'll have to bite the bullet.<br /><br />A product that achieves only 40% of its potential, from lack of 1% of functionality (and one that everyone else gets right as a basic starting point).<br /><br />Too bad.","I've been using point and shot cameras from Olympus and Sony.  They are good, but they still can't defeat Canon.  This Camera offers a lot of functions to play with, and everything can be manual controled.  The 10X zoom is something that you don't easily find in other cameras and it also gives you the oportunity to change lenses.  Get a big Compact Flash card and some rechargable batteries and you're ready to go.  It's only 3.2 mp, but it's what you really need because nobody is printing large pictures this days.","If you wanna<br /><br />1. shoot good close up shots of your loved ones;<br /><br />2. capture all that intricate art work of that museum pillar<br /><br />3. capture true colors of sparkling marble of taj mahal, with the green trees around, blue sky above and giant red sand stone gates in the background<br /><br />4. take that picture of well-lit downtown with lines of fast moving cars with their head lights on<br /><br />5. shoot that swing shot of tendulkar(the cricketing world knows him) from the pavilion<br /><br />6. great results from a match-making agency (non-Indians: Ignore this.

Now, thats a deal!","I am extremely pleased with this camera but bear in mind, I only send the pic over the internet and view them on the computer - no printed photo's, no enlargments.  The only bad feature of this camera is its failure to focus in very dim lite situations.  It does tell you by displaying the 'yellow' rectangle (not the green one which indicates it's focused) in the middle of the screen.  If you watch the color, you'll know when it is focused (green=focus, yellow=not focused).  Although I haven't had the camera that long, the battery life seems quite good compared to my 3 yr. old Kodak digital. I especially like the adjustable LCD screen, having had the older Kodak screen washed out from overhead sunlight.  Word of caution: I had called Canon several times about the low light shooting problem, and two of the 'tech' people said to return the camera for repair, saying it was faulty.  I questioned there diagnosis, and finally talked to a rep who understood the problem as something inherant to the camera and not correctable.  He explained it as not having sufficient contrast to properly focus the distance.  Don't pay $399, they are sold in the low $300 on the internet. I bought mine from Wiloughby's in NYC, and the price was fare and camera arrived quickly.  Jay","I received the S1 is for Christmas and my father in-law got the A95.  I love all the features of the S1, and it seems appropriate since I am much more technical than my father in-law.  However, there are focus issues with the S1.  I took pictures with both cameras using the same image and same angle, one after another.  I transferred to the PC and the A95 seemed a bit better.  I think the issue is the focus technology on the S1.  The A95 took the shot much faster and always looked better.  I haven't decided if I want to take the S1 back yet.  I love the 10x zoom and it works fine at full zoom if you know how to use the manual focus feature.  I love all the added features, and the hardware is much better built than the A95.  Also, the A95 has a simple window viewfinder, while the S1 gives you the digital readout just as if you were looking at the screen.","Our PowerShot A20 served me and my wife extremely well. However, we upgraded to the PowerShot S1 mainly for the increased megapixels, 10x optical zoom, and ability to take better night photos. The S1 has not disappointed. It's taken excellent night photos. We've also been extremely pleased with the zoom. We're only beginning to learn the many features of our new camera. Also we have been pleasantly surprised with the battery life in the S1...we bought rechargable Energizer 2300mAh batteries. My only minor issues are with the lens cover. It falls off from time to time, so I'd highly recommend attaching it to the carrying strap. Also, I've never been a big fan of aiming with the display, so I was disappointed to find that the viewfinder is also an LCD. In bright sunlight it's sometimes hard to aim.<br /><br />Overall after two months of use we love the S1 and would highly recommend it.<br /><br />Additionally, based on reviews/recommendation of other S1 owners, we bought the Tamrac 5693 camera case. It's a great compliment to the S1.","I've had this camera for about a year now and overall I'm still quite happy with my purchase. The drawbacks to this camera are common with all digital models I've tried and the picture quality is quite exceptional. Here's some more details...<br /><br />First the pros: It's very ergonomic, well-designed, and easy to use, even for first time digital camera owners like me. The 10x zoom works smoothly and very well. In good light the auto focus locks on quickly and the pictures turn out great, even when blown up as large as 8x10. With the right paper in the printer I cannot tell the difference quality-wise between these pix and my old film camera. I really like the flip out monitor screen for shooting pictures over crowds (e.g., at sporting events). It's very visible except in harsh, direct sunlight. The image stabilization works well, eliminating the need for a tripod in most situations. Sports mode gives clear action shots even when your subject is moving quickly. The self-timer is a nice feature too. Images are easy to download to the PC (with XP you don't even need the software that comes with the camera). The built in flash works better than I expected (up to ~10' away anyway).<br /><br />Now the cons: In low light situations the camera is extremely challenging to use. First off, the viewfinder is electronic and you cannot see what you are aiming at through it or the LCD monitor. In night or auto mode close-up pictures come out okay, you just have to guess at your aim. Longer shots do not work out well at all. At my son's Christmas concert last night I snapped 43 shots. 5 turned out well and 2 more were usable. The rest were garbage. Anytime the kids moved at all, the shot turned out blurry no matter what mode I had it set on (and I tried several), even with a tripod. This was extremely frustrating!! Further, like most digital cameras there is a significant delay between when you push the button and when the picture is actually snapped. It is very hard to take sports shorts unless you get lucky with timing or use the movie mode.<br /><br />Other stuff: you'll want to purchase a larger memory card. 32mb just doesn't cut it. I went with 256 and have been very happy. You also want to purchase some rechargeable batteries. This thing takes 4 AA's and really chews them up fast, especially when you are using the monitor and zooming a lot. Be sure to use the lens cap strap. It's designed to slide off when the camera is turned on (a convenience?) yet it tends to fall off at odd times since it does not snap in place. Don't buy the Cannon camera bag. It is poorly designed and overpriced.","I've had it almost 6mos now and couldn't be happier.<br /><br />You'll need rechargeable NiMHbatteries and at least a 256mb card.<br /><br />I love this camera for the great pictures it takes.<br /><br />The zoom brings you right in close so you can avoid having to crop photos later.  Even at 3.2M pixels the zoom makes this a better choice over most 5 or 6mp cameras.  If you wear glasses some other cameras don't have the viewfinder adjustment and even though it has a small LCD, it swivels so you can hold the camera away from you to hold the camera at odd angles and still get a good shot.  Add that to total AUTO for the rest of the family and 100% manual control for me to play and its a great choice.<br /><br />Image stabilization works too, you still need to try and hold the camera still, but it can make all the difference.","Overall I am very happy with the camera, but couldn't give it 5 stars because (1)No date/time imprinting function (2)Picture quality is only comparable to my old Pentax IQZoom point-and-shoot film camera.<br /><br />I will try to list pros and cons that are not discussed in other posts.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Video format is AVI and can be easily played on computer.<br />2) Tons of manual controls to set aperture, exposure, focus, etc.<br />3) When doing manual focus, a window pops up with zoomed-in image so that you can see if the focus is good.<br />4) Time lapse shooting and continuous shooting available (read online manual)<br />5) Very versatile LCD. Can be flipped, twisted, and turned in many positions.<br />6) You can take many pictures and stitch them together to make a huge picture (read the online manual)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Regular AA batteries run out too quickly. NiMH batteries are working well.<br />2) No functionality to imprint date/time on the image.<br />3) You need high-speed (18X) CF to be able to shoot video in highest quality.<br />4) Lens cap doesn't fit snugly, but can be tied to shoulder belt loop so you don't lose it.<br />5) Doesn't fit in my existing digital camera bag - plan on buying a new one.<br />6) LCD is too small.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br />1) Bought a 4GB Hitachi MiniDrive ($170 @ outpost) and I am happy.<br />2) Flash is adequate, but a slave flash ($20 @ Ritz) might help.<br />3) When buying the bag, make sure it has pouches for spare batteries and CF cards. Also, make sure the camera fits in the main pouch.<br /><br />Updated On 12/27/2004:<br />I bought \"Targus DPBC03 ProBlack Digital Camera Case Max\" camera bag from Amazon. S1 IS barely fits in the bag. There is a pouch to keep batteries. The pouch is big enough to hold CF card also. I am going to keep the bag, but you might want to consider buying a slightly larger bag.<br /><br />I tried the \"photo stitch\" functionality over the weekend. I shot two scenaries and stiched them. One came out very well - impossible to know that it is stitched. Other scene seems to need some manual work to be done - one of the shots in the series wouldn't merge well.","I bought it because of ...<br /><br />10x optical, image stabilization, AA batteries, and 640x480-30FPS with sound videos.  Nobody else has this combination.<br /><br />I love the slide show and TV video out feature.  This camera<br /><br />has a lot of features.<br /><br />Downside ...<br /><br />It eats batteries but still using AA's for travel abroad will be good.<br /><br />640x480x30fps video eats maybe 3mbs per second of course it's great to just record 20 seconds for many action scenes.<br /><br />Reviews at [...] are good and the surfer video clip is a good example of video.","It took me about 6 months to decide which camera to buy. Looked at various Kodaks, Canons, Olympus..and I finally chose this beautiful Canon S1.<br /><br />Firstly, the main criteria was picture quality. Canon has no problem satifying this criteria. The images were just great even in tough conditions: Camera in good light while the object to be shot is in darkness...I was amazed to see the clear, perfect result.<br /><br />Next, the zoom. 10x! what more can one ask for..I didnt but I got more..an Image Stabilizer. And this is just a fantastic feature..able to get pro looking shots in night mode with complete zoom in.<br /><br />I could just go on with the video mode...<br /><br />I havent even discoverd all the features yet.<br /><br />This is a surely a good buy<br /><br />I just wished it can with an recharger that allowed me to plug in the camera...But I just need to be a battery recharger set and I'll be good then.","I bought this camera to replace a nearly five-year-old Olympus D-460Z and I am quite impressed with it overall.<br /><br />My main criteria were high zoom and low shot-to-shot delay, and the PowerShot S1 IS satisfies both criteria extremely well...and more. It has controls for every aspect of picture-taking that I could ever want to adjust. The commonly used functions are usually only a button press or two away rather than buried in the menu system.<br /><br />The movie mode is quite useful rather than just a gimmick. I can definitely see myself leaving my camcorder at home in situations where movie-taking opportunities will be few and far between.<br /><br />My D-460Z supports alignment guides for panoramas (when using Olympus-branded flash cards), but I'm blown away by the PowerShot S1 IS's \"Stitch Assist\" implementation. For every shot after the first, you are presented with a dimmed version of the overlapping one-third of the previous shot with which to align your next shot.<br /><br />I really like that this camera uses standard AA cells. It will save me a fortune on extra battery sets vs. the Li-ion batteries used in several other digicams.<br /><br />I wish Canon had opted for a USB 2.0 or Firewire interface because the files -- movies, especially -- take forever to download over USB 1.1. This fact did not detract from my rating because I find the workaround to be perfectly acceptable: a USB 2.0 or Firewire CompactFlash reader.<br /><br />I do have a couple of nit-picky focus-related complaints. First of all, I find the autofocus to be very problematic in incandescent room light, which leads to many out-of-focus shots because even the manual focus is difficult to use in that light. Also, it's very awkward to use the manual focus with the electronic viewfinder due to the placement of the omni control; I wish they had put the manual focus up/down controls more toward the front of the camera.","I bought this camera a few months ago and i am very happy with it. This camera has alot of features, and considering how many it has, its very compact.  Some of the features include:<br /><br />10x optical zoom:  This is a very nice zoom range, and it gives you alot of framing flexiblility.<br /><br />Image stablilizer: This is a very good stabilizer, especially for the movie mode.  Also, when you're zoomed in at 10x, it helps you keep the camera steady<br /><br />Manual Focus:  I guess this counts as a feature, but that being said, its not a very good one.  When you zoom in, it wont let you focus under two feet, which isnt very useful.  Also, the auto focus on this camera isnt so great, since it only has one point and doesnt have an AF assist lamp, so focusing right can be really annoying sometimes<br /><br />Movie Mode:  This camera has a GREAT movie mode.  The 30 frames per second really makes the movies look nice, plus the sound quality is better than most digital cameras.  The thing i really like, though, is that you can use the 10x lens to zoom while you're taking movies, just like a camcorder.  Now, the zoom isnt silent while your taking a movie, even if you use it at its \"reduced speed\" for the movie mode.  If you use the zoom's REALLY slow speed, though, it doesnt interfere with sound, so thats not really a problem<br /><br />Panoramas:  This camera helps you take a series of pictures to form a panorama.  It saves them as individual pictures, but the software the camera comes with to stich them is very easy to use and stiches the pictures nicely<br /><br />Time lapse:  This camera can take time lapse shots; you can take up to 100 pictures, and its a nice mode if you want to make an interesting movie<br /><br />  Theres probably alot of other modes i didnt get to, but when you get this camera, youll be trying to figure out all it can do for a long time.  If you dont want that though, this camera has a fully auto mode, which makes it just like a point and shoot.  On the other hand, if you want a camera that does EVERYTHING, this is probably it; you wont be disappointed either way","Pros:<br /><br />* 10x optical zoom<br /><br />* Plenty of accessories (lenses, underwater housing, etc.) available<br /><br />* Uses CF cards and AA batteries<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />* Slightly bulky<br /><br />* Grainy pictures for low light conditions<br /><br />* Only 3 MP<br /><br />Canon could have incuded a case and a remote, instead of keeping them as separate accessories.","It is a good camera.","I have had this camera for about 3 months.  One complaint I read in other reviews is that it uses up batteries quickly.  Well, my experience has been that I think it does very well on Rayovac rechargeable NiMH batteries.  These recharge in 15 minutes and last a long time.<br /><br />The features on this camera are great for beginners and the more advanced.  For beginners you can use all the automatic settings and it does a great job.  For the advanced you have shutter or aperture priority settings as well as manual settings so you can do some creative things.  You can change the ISO from 50 to 400 based on lighting.  I also like the movie mode.  I bought a half gig compact flash card, which are not that expensive, and can store 4+ minutes at the highest resolution to about 20 minutes at the lowest.  The pictures are clear and crisp and the colors are brilliant.  I read some complaints about the flash.  I have not experienced any problems, but it is possible to adjust flash output if pictures seen to be over-exposed, as some complained.<br /><br />At maximun zoom, unless you're using a high shutter speed, the image stabilization is not enough to compensate for movement.  You may need a tripod.  I took some action pictures at a baseball game and used the 400 ISO setting and shot a lot of pictures at 1/2000 sec with max zoom.  The pictures were outstanding!<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera","Es una camara digital muy completa, con una gran cantidad de funciones increibles, el zoom de 10x es impresionante y por eso la hace diferente que muchas de las camaras tradicionales de zoom 3x. Lo unico que no me gusto fue que cuando grabas video y haces zoom la camara emite un sonido que es grabada durante el video.","I bought this for my wife who is a big time scrapbooker. This is the BEST camera as well as the best item I have ever given her for scrapbooking. The pictures are just as good as higher megapixel cameras. The swivel screen is more useful than you could ever think. If you use the option of partially pressing down the button prior to taking the shot you get lightning fast capture. If you want a great digital camera you cannot go wrong here. We have been using this for several months and for many different occasions with no prblems at all. We took it to Schiltterbahn (a waterpark) and it took amazing pictures. You could see the water droplets falling off of the kids. The zoom was so helpful. If the kids were on the other side of the lagoon we could easily zoom in to get GREAT pictures. My wife took shots of us going down waterslides and none of them were blurry. I mean these looked like professional pictures. We take it everwhere and use it at all times of day. Buy the camera! I am thinking of buying another.","This camera takes unbelievably good pictures. True, 3.2 Megapixels<br />may seem a little light, but the zoom and image stabilization<br />more than makes up for this. Normal alkalines won't last very<br />long, but Canon is upfront about this and recommends using Nimh's.<br />Canon also tells you straight up what kind of performance to expect<br />with flashcards. Might as well get a big high speed card up front.<br />All controls are logically laid out and very easy to use. The enclosed user manual explains pretty thoroughly how to use basic as well as advanced features.<br /><br />Update as of 12/5/09<br />My camera fell victim to the bad CCD-chip issue. However, Canon fixed it for free.<br />They had a very quick turn-around and very knowledgeable and helpful staff.<br />Additionally, somebody mentioned a slight degradation in performance after the repair.<br />My experience is exactly the opposite, the camera is performing better than it ever did.<br />I suspect upgraded firmware is responsible for that.","The camera lives up to its promise.<br /><br />Most Valuable Features:<br /><br />1. Amazing and extraordinary movie mode. I would advise to purchase a Sandisk 1 GB compact flash memory card.<br /><br />2.Great 10x optical zoom. Takes time to get used to since it's a bit hasty in its operation.<br /><br />3.DIGIC autofocus technology ensures you to have great pics, especially if you're an amateur.<br /><br />4.Good quality flash- does not wash out images.<br /><br />Overall, I'm more than sure that you'll be satisfied with your purchase. I don't see any other camera on Amazon.com that carries this excelent combination of features.<br /><br />Good Luck,  Best Wishes,  S.M.","Let me tell you, straight out, this family is a digital family.  We've had digital cameras for years now and we've had quite an assortment.  Everyone, in our family, has one.<br /><br />My personal favorite, is the digital rebel.  I know you're asking, why is she reviewing this camera then?  Easy!  I wanted a camera that I could easily whip out and capture a shot with... but I didn't want the tiny handheld ones.  I wanted something that felt comfortable, in my hand.... yet.. wasn't heavy.  I was also looking for zoom.<br /><br />This camera fits that bill, perfectly! and at a great price too!<br /><br />To start, this camera runs on 4 AA batteries.  Usually, that's a turn off for me, but I picked up some 2300 mhz batteries and I can easily get 500+ shots out of a charge of those, w/ the LCD and the flash on.  With the batteries, this baby weights, about a pound.  While that may seem heavy, compared to the little tiny cameras and cell phones that are avialable these days.. Let me tell you.  That's not heavy.  It's got a great neck strap and the camera carrys comfortably on that, around your neck,  w/out weighing you down.<br /><br />The 10x zoom is real nice!  Now, I'm only using optical zoom, otherwise, with the digital kicked in, it would be a 30x.  I just rely on the optical.  This camera takes some VERY nice pictures with that zoom.  A picture worthy of the Canon name!  And you can capture such a nice picture because of the IS (image stabilization) that is built into this camera.  You will notice little (or no) camera shake when you have it fully zoomed in on something.  Admittedly, it seemed like it, with the first couple test shots I took.  I was looking through the viewfinder, aiming at something down the street.. and it seemed like I was waivering all over the place.  But when I downloaded the pictures.  I was VERY pleased.  Crystal clear!<br /><br />I have the found, that some cameras have terrible color saturation, w/ the picture right out of the camera.  This isn't one of them.  With the default settings, the blues (sky, water) are rich, tonal, and dimentional.  There's no red problems, when shooting reds, that I've noticed.  Sometimes reds will bleed out .. or not appear true.. and that's simply not the case.<br /><br />Indoor pictures.. I'll be honest.. W/ the built in flash, this little camera, kicks my $1K camera's behind!  The flash doesn't tend to wash out the subject (on the default settings).. skin tones are exactly what they are.  Little or no adjustments are needed, in my book.<br /><br />This camera is fast to start up, and write, to the CF card that it uses (buy a bigger CF card!).  It's got auto controls for those that don't want to think.  For those that want to learn a bit more about photography, it's got the F stops, and all that jazz..<br /><br />ALONG WITH...<br /><br />the ability to change your focal point.  You're not stuck in the middle of the frame.  If you want your subject off to the left of the frame..and the rest to be 'soft'... That's not a problem.  With a simple push of the button, your point of focus changes.<br /><br />I can go on.. but I'm sure you have the idea, after reading all these reviews.<br /><br />This is a great camera for the money.  While you maybe taking a step down, in megapixels, you're gaining the zoom ability.  The decrease in the megapixels, I feel, are not that noticible.<br /><br />In fact, this camera has all the features that I was looking for, in my higher end cameras. .. but for a fraction of the price.<br /><br />i wouldn't think twice about recommending this camera to anyone.  It's a great camera.","I think the Canon Powershot S1 IS is a great camera for those wanting to step up out of a regular point and shoot type of camera.  Wanting something more, I researched various types of digital cameras for a year, and finally placed my order for the S1 IS this past May.<br /><br />Currently, I've taken about 1800 pictures in all types of situations.  The feature that sold me on the camera was the image stabilization and optical zoom.  Yes, the 3.2 megapixels was a concern since I was hoping for 4 or more, but the pics my camera takes have been excellent.  No second guessing in my camera choice!<br /><br />Most shots of mine are outdoors of the kids, sporting events, and recreational activities which produce fabulous pictures.  The indoor shots for school concerts, birthday parties, etc., are very good.  Sometimes some tinkering is needed to get a good shot indoors or in low-light situations.  Auto mode indoors usually produces good shots, however the early evening outdoor shots appear darker than they really are.  I am seriously considering getting a tripod so I can manually change aperature and shutter speed settings to get realistic lighting in evening shots without blurred images from hand shake.  The camera can produce decent low-light shots, but be prepared to spend time experimenting in getting a shot you like.  Manual focus comes in very handy for these shots.<br /><br />I've read much about the lens cap from other reviews.  Actually I like the fact that it slides off easily.  The manual says to loop it through the neck strap so it doesn't get lost, and for people who may turn on the camera and forget to take off the cap, the easy slide off may actually prevent damage to lens when it extends after turning it on.  I really haven't found this to be a problem, more of an asset.<br /><br />Fast moving sporting events can be a little tricky.  Many times I have full zoom on when shooting at soccer games.  With the kids running around a lot, I tended to move the camera as they were moving, but of course, the image freezes in the viewfinder or LCD for two seconds.  The camera can be set to eliminate the freezed image after taking the shot, but there is still a lag time until you can take the next shot, thus your subject is out of the viewfinder.  With this in mind, I decided to set the camera for continuous shooting, keep the camera still and aim for a spot where the kids are headed (but not in the viewfinder or LCD yet), and start shooting.  I get a lot of good shots this way.  Yes, the first several pics are nothing but green grass, but as the kids run across the field continuous shooting works to your advantage.  At events like this, I take about 100 pictures and therefore can pick and choose several that are great shots.  Keeping the camera still while continuous shooting also eliminates blurring.  Although image stabilization does work extremely well, trying to constantly follow players in a game at full zoom causes a lot of extra hand shake and camera movement which can result in slight blurriness.  The continuous shooting mode and keeping the camera still while shooting helps to counteract this allowing the image stabilization to really do its job.<br /><br />Comments have also been made on the tiny LCD compared to other models that have 2-inch plus screens.  Remember, larger LCD's use more battery juice.  I tend to use the viewfinder most of the time anyway so this hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />As for the video mode, this camera takes EXCELLENT video clips.  I bought a 512 card when I bought the camera and love taking short clips here and there.  I usually set the video mode to 15 fps, although 30 is recommended for excellent quality.  15 is more than adequate for me just as long as I keep the camera still when recording.  Camera movement makes the 15 fps very evident resulting in a choppy look to the video.  Keeping it still makes for a smooth movie with a decent amount of recording time.  Also, the zoom is a GREAT feature in video mode.  The video aspect of this camera, in my opinion, is a such a plus to parents of school-age children.  No extra camcorder needed for school events and there's no problem sitting in the back seats of the auditorium or school cafeteria.  The 10X zoom will get you close to your child.  (The digital zoom, however, does not work in video mode).<br /><br />As for batteries, get two sets of rechargeables, and keep a spare set of alkaline ones in your camera bag.  Be prepared because when the low-battery indicator goes on, the camera will turn off VERY quickly after that warning.  I purchased a $6 camera bag at Target which fits the S1 IS nicely as well.  No need to buy the name-brand Canon one which is probably pricier.  I also bough a card reader to plug into my USB port so I don't have to worry about plugging the cables into my camera and computer.  This saves on battery life as well.  As for the tiny, useless 32 MB card that comes with the Canon, I have found that I can save about 20 - 30 pictures on it to take in for \"developing\" at a local Rite Aid or CVS.  This is great for mail order pics as well since I really don't care if this useless-sized card gets lost.<br /><br />Overall, I give this camera 5 stars.  It has produced some fabulous pictures for me.  I really wanted a camera with 10X optical zoom because I don't have the time to be cropping a lot of pictures.  I want to get the picture the way I like it when pressing the shutter button.  It does have some shortcomings which would probably bother experienced professionals, but for me its a great camera that does the job I exected it to.  Even recommended it to my brother who bought it as well.  The manual is great too, and is very easy to read and understand.  All the controls are easy access with the camera having the right size and feel.  Auto mode works great in most situations and the camera is great for those like to rely on the camera doing the work most of the time.  The creativity is there, however, for people like me who want to do something more with their picture taking.  Other features I love are the sepia and black and white options.  There are many features one can experiment with when using this camera to stretch their experience in photography.","If you're like most people reading about the Canon Powershot S1, you've owned at least one or two digital cameras in the past, and chances are they've been the point and shoot kind. Now you'd like something with a few more manual controls.<br />I'm not going to repeat what's in many other reviews here (an amazing 10x stabilized zoom ... you'll find it difficult to move back to a camera without this, generally excellent photo quality, and really compact - HOW do they fit this all in such a tiny package??) but instead I'd like to point out a few aspects of the camera that haven't been discussed that much in other reviews here.<br /><br />1. Get yourself a basic book on digital photography, so you will actually use some of the manual features of this camera. A $15 investment will give you better photo results within 30 minutes. Guaranteed. I got myself \"Digital Photography Pocket Guide\" from Amazon and I can already see the results in my photos.<br />2. You'll love taking photos by using the viewfinder and not the LCD screen (which, at 1.5\", seems dismally small for a camera such as this) - the viewfinder is full of (though not cluttered with) details of your shot. Aperture, resolution, etc.<br />3. The zoom control is tricky and takes time to get used to. A slight flick of the control and you have quickly moved beyond 5x magnification. You'll get the hang of it quickly, but be forewarned that you will be frustrated using the zoom initially.<br />4. while other reviews have commented on using the Sandisk Ultra II card for taking VGA movies, I'm a little perplexed. While the movies are recorded on the card just fine, transferring them to my 2.4 gigahertz P4 machine leads to loss of data in the transfer and I am unable to view them properly. I am convinced there is an issue with the file transfer speed related to the camera's mechanism, NOT the memory card - for I have tried multiple ones. If you are buying this camera purely for this reason, do check this out carefully so that you too don't deal with the same problems (besides, the 512 MB card allows barely two minutes of 640x480 video.)<br />5. The battery meter, which comes on only when the batteries are about to run out, could be better and indicate the approximate number of shots left. Come on Canon, you can do better...<br /><br />All in all, these are small deficiencies, certainly not glaring. I'm pleased with my stabilized zoom camera choice (the Panasonic FZ series were too bulky, the Minolta Dimage Z series too plastic feeling).<br /><br />One last point. Avoid the Canon PSC 70 carrying case made for this camera. Do read my review on that one should you purchase this camera.","I am a 22 year old college student who doesn't have time to learn about all the bells and whistles of digital photography. However, Canon has made picture taking easy without wanting to rip my hair out. This camera is so easy to use, I had it down in about 30 minutes. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants a powerful zoom, image stabilization, and most importantly- a beautiful shot. I have had this camera for about 2 months and it has been a pleasure owning it. My only gripe, (along with everyone else's) is the lack of focusing in low light situations. However, this camera does wonderfully outside or in a brightly lit room, shot after shot. I have received compliment after compliment on my photos, and I have never had a photography class in my life! The pictures are always vibrant and crisp (even though it is 3.2 megapixels.) So, if you are looking for an affordable camera with great features- this is the camera for you!","I bought this camera in June and have used it all summer.  I am very pleased with the results.  The image stabilizer is amazing.  The pictures are clear whether taking pictures of moving grand kids or from a moving boat or car.  I have taken many pictures from horseback while trotting down a trail.  These pictures are great.  The image stablizer is also helpful when using the 10x zoom.  Once you get used to the lag in time that most digital cameras have, you can get the pictures that you want.  For example, if you want a picture of your child diving, snap the picture just before the jump.  The video quality is excellent.  If you plan to use it for many videos, then you should buy a 1 gig compact flash card, otherwise a 512 mb would be adequate for most.  I bought a DVD burner and with the help of Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 have had a blast making videos that incorporate the photos and video clips.  I also  run the slideshow through my VCR and save on a VHS.  I first add text to my photos with my photo software, then save the pictures back to my compact flash card to give titles, etc. to my slideshow.<br /><br />  You will want to use rechargeable batteries.  Two sets of the high end batteries (2200) will last through an entire vacation.<br /><br />I have not used all of the features yet, but I love the camera.  It was easy for me to learn and I would recommend it for anyone who wants a camera that can do it all.","I have been an amateur photographer for many years.  My favorite type of photography is \"nature\", especially birds.  I used to mainly use a Nikon N90S with various lenses and such.  But that gets heavy and hot in the Everglades.<br /><br />I have been using the S1 now a month or two.  I absolutely love it.  The zoom power is wonderful for that long bird shot.  You lose some resolution using the digital zoom though, but that's expected.  It's a light camera but you can still handhold long shots thanks to the image stabilization.  I use a monopod most of the time now.<br /><br />It's almost like an SLR, with the digital viewfinder!  Using the back screen that most cameras have is difficult in bright sunlight.  The digital viewfinder in the S1 is still a minor difficulty in bright sunlight, but very usable.  All the functions are pushbutton, and settings visible in both screen and viewfinder.<br /><br />Functions at this price level are amazing.  I am very very happy with available options.  It has a \"one button preset\" where you can set one button to do a chosen function.  I use that button for setting ISO speed.<br /><br />I use a UV filter all the time with the special adapter.  Beautiful outdoor shots.<br /><br />Macro capability is very good.<br /><br />The S1 is not cheap...but it tries very hard to be a digital SLR.  And that is megabucks there...so the S1, in a way, is a bargain.<br /><br />It also has a true neck strap, not a hand strap, like most digital cameras.<br /><br />Picture quality is good.  I have my own website and pics are fine.  3.2megapixels is ok.  I think more sensor resolution must be coupled with better optics, otherwise no point in a 6mp camera with plastic lenses.  So the S1 is fine in this respect.  Good optics, adequate sensor.<br /><br />Battery life is good.  Some complain about battery life.  I find it good with 2200mah Nimh rechargables.  But those who complain don't realize the first few times you use a rechargable battery the battery only has limited capacity....so it ain't the camera, it's the battery.  If you get new batteries, charge them up and stick them in a flash light and discharge them like this a few times.  Then you will get good battery life in camera.<br /><br />I gave the S1 5 stars.  It deserves them.<br /><br />If you don't need all the features or long zoom, try the outstand \"A\" series by Canon.  The A75 is a great value.  I use an old A40, and A75, and the S1 for my digital stuff.","I wanted to combine camcorder (vital with young children) and digital camera, to always be able to get the best of these precious moments with kids w/o carrying the whole camera bag (reserved usually for travel).<br /><br />After considering may other contenders, I purchased the Nikon S7000, which I promptly returned, because of the lack of stabilization (both pix and video quality at long range were simply not acceptable, regardless of the 6 Mp resolution).<br /><br />I purchased the S1 3 days later, and I have not looked back ever since. Color accuracy is excellent, some low-light limitations (widely reported, not too much of an issue for my fairly casual use), awesome zoom length and stabilization performance, key for candid pix, very good battery performance, etc.<br /><br />Only one thing could be better: the next, better version of the same camera, in the same body. Ideally, increase pix res to 5/6 Mp, and DV quality to 1024x768 (640x480 is simply NOT DV quality, period).","I've had this camera for a couple of weeks and have found it to be great. Sure the lens cap falls off, but you can't take pictures with it on! I would recommend this camera to the beginner or somone who's been taking pictures for a long time. I bought the 256 mb card to go in it and found that I can take pictures for quite a while without having to worry about running out of space. Do yourself a favor and try this camera out, I think you'll be pleased with it.","Don't listen to all these people that are so picky on some imperfections no cam is perfect but this cam is very good the movie mode alone is the highest quality you can get on a digital camera right now i can't find any flaws in this cam.","Very nice camera. It has good weight and balance in your hand and is user friendly.  Whether your a novice or an experienced shutterbug, you should appreciate the range of functions available to get that great shot.  Short of an SLR, this is the best camera I've tested.","I have done quite a bit of research on digital cameras, and have read many reviews. The fact is, that there is no perfect digital camera, and people are going to find little things they don't like about all of them.<br /><br /> I purchased the S1 IS about a week or so ago, and this is one great camera.<br /><br /> Some people say the lense cap falls off... well... it's suppose to... keep it attached to the camera so it don't get lost and put it back on when you put it in the case.<br /><br /> Some people say the battery life is bad... well... get some rechargable 2300 ma batteries and a charger... and keep a couple sets charged... one set will last for hours... and... if you are in a jam you can get AA batteries anywhere.<br /><br /> Some people say the display is hard to see in bright sunlight or in low light... well... I have not seen one that is not.<br /><br /> Some people say that the pictures are not sharp... well... try setting it in auto until you learn how to use the many great settings... I printed 8 1/2 x 11's that where as sharp as a tack.<br /><br /> There was a problem with memory erros, but if you download the firmware update, and follow the instructions, it will resolve the problem. I personally did not have that problem, but I updated my firmware anyway.<br /><br /> The fact is...<br /> This is one heck of a great camera. The zoom is outstanding, you can print up to 8 1/2 x 11's with good quality, the stabelization is great, and if you want to learn the manual settings, they are great too.<br /><br /> I would still reccomend a tripod for shots with shutter speeds greater than 1 second.<br /><br /> The software is everything you need to organize, enhance, and print your pics.<br /><br /> If you are looking for the perfect digital camera... you will never find it.<br /><br /> If you are looking for the best digital camera in the $400 to $500 dollar price range, I would recommend the S1 IS above all others in the same price range.","I recently upgraded from an Olympus C2100, and I was hesistant to leave the Olympus brand. However, I am really starting to love this camera. I attended a Michigan Football game recently and the pictures I took were very crisp, especially the ones taken from across the field. This was proof positive that my decision to go with the lower megapixel in favor of image stabilization was a good one. This camera does have it's limitations, but like a previous reviewer, I would highly reccomend it!!!","I could not be more pleased with this digicam.  I was looking for a middle-of-the-road camera: solid professional features: more than a point-and-shoot but less than an 8 or 9 megapix device.  This Canon is perfect.  Sturdy. Feature packed. A solid feel and size without being too heavy.  All the reviews are right: you'll spend another $100 min on accesories, batteries, etc.  But I would do it over again if I had to.  On AUTO mode, anyone can snap a pic in a instant - yet the camera is full of other modes and features that would suit all but the professional photographer.  And at 3+ megapixels, the pictures are simply supurb.  I like the fold out screen and the SLR type viewfinder combo.  The 10x zoom is wonderful and very fast.  If you are looking for a solid, feature rich digicam: heftier than a point and shoot but not as expensive as a digital SLR, this is the cam for you.  I love it!","Upgrading to this model from the Canon A70 was a great move.  We know the abilities and design of the Canons, and yet have a passle of new features to try out, especially the 10x optical zoom, which sold us on the camera.<br /><br />The size is heftier, both larger and heavier than the smaller Canons, but worth the weight in capability.  The pictures at both no-zoom and fully-zoomed are excellent, especially outdoors.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, indoor pictures do require the flash.  If the auto mode tells you to use a flash, agree with it!  Trying to make the picture without is rarely a success, unlike with the A70, which would frequently over-flash.  The IS takes excellent quality pictures indoors.<br /><br />For cases, try the LowePro line, sold at Amazon at a discount.  The D-res 25 and 30 come up on their matrix as fitting this camera, and I bought the 30.  It fits well, with room to spare.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />Optical zoom<br /><br />LCD display (flip out, flip over, invert!)<br /><br />Quality<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />Sorting out \"menus\" and \"functions\"  It will just take time.","The PowerShot S1 IS is my first ever digital camera, but I still have an old Canon AE1 that I bought 30 years ago and still works after having travelled from Svalbard (arctic) to the hot climate of Greece.  Now I needed something lighter and choose to stick with Canon because of their optical quality.  I picked the camera after having gone to a photofair and seen blown up prints taken with different cameras and subsequently chose the PowerShot S1.  Pixels are too much in focus, too little is said about optical quality.  My own experience is that even tough this camera has less pixels than some other cameras, the picture quality is better due to optical quality of lens.<br />I have not had time to learn all the settings of the camera but take it as it comes.  It's a good idea to start using the Auto-mode.  I have bought a Lexar 256 mb. card and it works fine - no problems.<br />One problem I have is with the White Balance of colours.  In daylight when pictures have strong contrasts - the sky always comes out white - even when the other colours are fine.  I don't know how to overcome this problem, but it annoys me.  I had hoped that downloading a firmware update from Canons webpages would solve it, but it didn't.<br />Conclusion is that I'm happy with the camera, the quality seems good and the picture quality is the best I have seen from all those different cameras I saw in that fair, but white balance needs to be improved.<br />A year later:<br />I have learned to manipulate the whitebalance and that has improved the problem with white skies and daylight somewhat.  But I have to edit my shots with Microsofts Digital Image and a few filters bought online from NIK multimedia.<br />I should also inform you that this camera has problems with autofocus on full zoom whenever there is poor lighting conditions, but you always have the possibility of manually correcting focus whenever this happens.","I Purchased the PowerShot S1 IS a few weeks ago as a step up from my trusty Olympus Brio D-230. The main features I purchased the Canon for were for the 10X optical zoom and the image stabilization, both of which work tremendously.<br /><br />The battery life is fairly decent, I got around 200 pictures with one set of rechargeable NiMH batteries - albeit with the flash mostly turned off and using the viewfinder. The picture quality is very good, and the 3.2MP coupled with the optical zoom make for some spectacular short and long range photography.<br /><br />This camera is relatively similar size and weight wise to the Minolta S414, another camera that I've had some experience with. The Canon's 10X zoom far outdoes the 4x zoom on the S414, and the picture quality is relatively similar (in some instances the S414 does deliver a better picture.) Movie quality is better on the Canon than on the S414.<br /><br />I also purchased a Lexar 512MB CF card to use with the camera. The interface is great, most pictures are stored on the card before I can move my face away from the viewfinder. Right now I have 169 pictures of highest resolution settings on the card and have room for around 250 more (according to the camera). The 512MB card may be overkill - the average user can probably get away with a 256MB card.<br /><br />As several other reviewers mentioned, the auto focus feature in the zoom doesn't seem to work well in dark environments (i.e. indoors, in dark areas, or in dense fog.) One trick I've found to work around it is to zoom out and then zoom back in on your subject. The other is to be patient and wait until the camera can figure things out, which can take up to 5 seconds in some instances. If you're taking pictures of moving items - forget it. But if you have the patience to wait, the results are really worth it. There are several setting which you can tinker with which probably would take care of this problem. The auto-focus problem is the reason I gave it 4 stars (once you get used to it, it's really a half-star problem - but still a problem.)<br /><br />For someone looking to upgrade from a non-zoom or mid-zoom camera or looking to explore amateur photography, I would recommend this camera hands down.","Being a grad student, I am very picky when it comes to spending a larger amount of money on a piece of hardware technology.  I probably did research (try cnet's site) for 2 months before finally deciding on a purchase.  I compared heavily against similar cameras like the Sony DSC-V1, DSC-F717, S50, Kodak DX6490, Nikon Coolpix 4300 and a few others.<br />Deciding Factors:<br />10x opt zoom & IS<br />Manual control abilities<br />Swivel LCD<br />body style<br />CF memory<br />AA batteries<br />Price & Canon name brand<br />After purchase:<br />This camera is awesome.  The zoom works great, especially with the IS technology.  The manual controls are extremely easy to use.  Combined with the comfortable body style i do most things with one hand.  Think of holding a gaming controller.  I'm very surprised at how much I use the swivel LCD (ie hold against a steady place and view easily).  The cheapest memory and ease of AA batteries make this a camera to use for an extended amount of time.  Indoor, low-lighting situations are hard on auto mode, otherwise I'm very happy.","I need a new digital camera to replace my Nikon Coolpix 755 purchased 3 years ago. The Nikon is pretty good, but it's too slow. I like wide zoom and the budget is less than $500. So I don't have too many choices. At last, 2 cameras left in my list: Canon Powershot S1 IS and Fuji S-5000.<br /><br />I am familiar with Fuji S-5000. It's a nice camera. However, I selected Canon, because: 1. It has IS; 2. It uses Compact Flash, same as Nikon; 3. A professional reviewer rated the Fuji S-5000 as average; but didn't rate the Canon. 4. Canon makes some great SLRs. If I could choose again, I would buy the Fuji.<br /><br />The Canon Powershot S1 IS is not bad at all. But it's not as good as I expected. Even though I knew that the camera's auto focus is not good under low light conditions, I was still disappointed when I tried to take some picture in my house in a bright sunny afternoon. The auto focus is really poor under those conditions. Furthermore, the response time is longer than the Fuji S-5000.<br /><br />Another bonus of S-5000 is that it has a ring in the box. We can attach a UV filter on the ring, so not to worry about the lens. For the Canon we need to pay $$ for a ring. The Canon's lens cap is very loose.","This is one fantastic camera. Canon hit the nail on the head with this one. As a botanist/ecologist/photographer (internationally published with medium and large format images), I do a lot of plant photography. I tried the Powershot Pro1 (see my review there) and was left a bit disappointed when compared to the S1 IS I purchased earlier. Although the S1 IS has only 3.2 megapixels compared to the Powershot Pro1's 8 megapixels, the S1 IS can produce images that, for basic uses and prints up to about 8x10 inches, will beat the Pro1. The problem is that the Pro1 seems to have trouble focusing up close (except for its SuperMacro mode which is limited to only 4 megapixels) while the S1 IS rarely misses the exact point. The S1 IS is also much easier to use.<br />The color of the S1 IS is very true and has nice depth. The images are generally less noisy than the Pro1. The colors produced in the vivid function will knock your socks off, and yet it is never gaudy.<br />The real marvel of this camera is Canon's tried and true optical stablization. I have the teleconverter for this camera which gives you the equivalent of a 608mm telephoto (that's about like a 12 power binocular) and not only does the converter actually improve the contrast of the main lens, you can hand hold the thing and get sharp images at only 1/200 of a second. I wouldn't even think of trying that with my EOS 10D, even with image stablization. I have taken some wonderful bird photos with the S1 IS (better than the 10D); they're not publishable, but definitely produce excellent prints.<br />Like most low pixel count cameras, the digital zoom is pretty worthless. I recommend keeping it off and cropping an image taken at maximum zoom.<br />I also highly recommend getting the filter adapter/lens shade kit. It's plastic, so you have to be careful of the threads, but if you put a number 3 closeup lens on the filter adapter and zoom all the way to maximum zoom (not digital zoom) you can get close to life size images. It won't match the EOS 10D with the Tamron 90 mm macro in sharpness, but it comes close for smaller prints, up to about 8x10. But then the S1 IS with a filter adapter and closeup lens doesn't costs over two grand either.<br />I highly recommend this camera, just keep in mind that it does have its limitations. But it's limitations are far, far less than you would expect. It will truly surprise you with what this camera can produce.","I love Canon.  I had a PowerShot s200, and it was my first camera.  After owning it for 2 years, I had to return it to BestBuy to exchange for another camera because there's a dead pixel on the LCD screen, but somehow carried onto every photo I took.  It was a great camera, I took many great pictures with it.  After return the S200, I got a new PowerShot S1 iS.  I wanted a G5 or a S60, but BestBuy didn't carry those.<br />The exterior of the S1 is beautiful.  The LCD monitor is clear and can be moved around.  All the buttons are easily reachable, and it holds comfortably in hands.  The 10X zoom is impressive, and the zoom motor is super fast.  The pop up flash is cool, and the shape of the whole camera just look very extraordinary.<br />Unlike other PowerSshot cameras, the S1 only has 1 auto focus point.  I believe right now most PowerShots have 9 auto focus points.  But S1 has exclusively an Image Stablizer feature, and it really helps a lot.  The optional manuel focusing function is wonderful.  The 12 shooting modes are really cool.  The price of the camera was not too expensive either.  It was $399 when I bought it.  The picture came out clear and sharp.  The night shots are pretty good too.<br />This camera is very user-friendly, and is suitable for amatures who want to do some advance shootings.  And the price of it is reasonalb and affortable.  And the looks of it just make it stand out from other cameras.","The Canon Powershot S1 IS is my fourth digital camera.  I am very impressed with the image stabilizer, making it possible to hand hold the camera at 10x in the field and get remarkably clear shots of birds and other wildlife. The image quality is excellent, and the ease of operation makes it possible for a beginner to get started.  The option of manual settings is a wonderful feature, and much used by experienced photographers.<br />The only addition I would like to see is a readily available camera bag for this camera.","This is my 3rd digital camera, and it fills needs that I always had with the first two, a Kodak DC240 and a Canon S40.  I always wanted to zoom further, and have more light without the unnatural light of the flash.  This camera allows you to overcome these two limitations, with the 10x zoom, and image stabilization allows shooting at longer exposure times, especially if you are sufficiently skilled to squeeze the shutter without shaking the camera.  The camera has a lot of capability that you have to learn, such as how to control where it focusses and where it sets the exposure, but once mastered, it is fantastic.<br />  I am not a professional, but an experienced enthusiast.  The 3.2MP has not been a drawback for me, since the zoom capability allows putting my pixels where I want them.<br />  The movie capability is awesome, especially the 640x480 30 frames/sec with fine compression, but with corresponding awesome storage requirements!!  You just need to get a larger hard disk, and faster connections to send the 1GB files!<br />  The camera is light and compact, but it is not pocketable like my S40.  I like that it takes standard batteries, rather than the $50 batteries of the S40!  The display is small, which certainly helps the battery life.  I don't really like the viewfinder, and would prefer having an optical viewfinder that doesn't freeze when I push the shutter.  I've been shooting some birds at full zoom, and when I take one shot, the delay until the viewfinder is active again can mean I lose my subject.<br />  I considered other cameras such as the Olympus 765, but rejected it when I learned that its movies do not include sound.  The ability of the S1 to zoom and autofocus in movie mode is a great step forward from my S40.<br />  In summary, I am still learning its capabilities, but already am a most happy owner of the S1 IS.","If you are looking for a camera that is not as expensive as a digital SLR, yet provides you with all the features, you've come to the right place. For a digital SLR, a 75-300mm, USM, IS lens alone costs more than this camera.<br />Pros<br />- 10X optical zoom<br />- Image stabilizer and Ultrasonic motor<br />- 3.2MP is good enough for large prints<br />- Almost all the controls that a SLR provides are available<br />- Swivel LCD screen is very accurate.<br />Cons<br />- Viewfinder is not great, but the LCD makes up for it.<br />- Need to purchase an expensive addon for wide angle 28mm shots<br />- AutoFocus in low light conditions is not great.<br />I can live with the cons as it saves a good deal of money over the digital SLR.","One of the best digital camera out there. I have been using it for the last 3 months and fully satisfied with it.<br />Pros:<br />Excellent quality digital photos. Probably one of the best in the cameras in this price range.<br />10X Zoom<br />Image stabilization<br />Provides full manual operation including Av and Tv priority<br />Camcorder quality movie mode<br />Cons:<br />Camera doesn't focus all that well in a low light situation<br />Electronic view finder instead of the optical<br />little slow in focussing maybe because of the slowness of the flash card used","After considerable research I purchased the Canon S1 IS camera from Amazon about a month ago along with the Lexar 12X 256MB Compact Flash memory.  It arrived even before Amazon said it would!  This is my first digital camera and so far I am very pleased with it.  I wanted a camera that would take good travel pictures and images of grandchildren who often don't like cameras near them.  I expect to print the better pictures as either 4x6 or 5x7 and occasionally 8x10s.  At first I was reluctant to consider 3.2MP cameras but my research showed that a figure of merit for a digital camera should actually be proportional to MP times the optical zoom factor squared.  This gives a heavy weighting to optical zoom (it's related to picture area) and it also means that you can avoid considerable cropping and wasting of MP.  That's why people are often surprised that this camera does so well against its higher MP competition.  It's also adequate for printing my size pictures. Unfortunately, most hand held 10X cameras used at maximum zoom also need to have a shutter speed of 1/400th of a second to avoid picture bluring caused by camera shake so that you can use this 10X feature only in bright sunlight, unless you support the camera.  The Canon S1's image stabilization system allows hand held pictures with much slower shutter speeds so it is useful more often.  I always leave it on and I've taken sharp pictures of ducks, birds, and, oh yes, our grandchildren at a playground.  Our daughter, who is a professional photographer, has even commented on the quality of these candid shots, something she did not do with my film camera with lower power zoom.  Independently, I also purchased a lightweight RipVan100 battery charger that can operate at overseas voltages and I carry around an extra set of charged NIMH AA batteries, just in case, although I've yet to need them.  Of course, in a pinch, I can always use universally available AA batteries, another feature of this camera.<br />This camera, like all 10X zooms, uses an electronic viewfinder.  I find that it is hard to see well in bright sunlight (especially if I'm wearing sunglasses), even at maximum brightness setting.  Its resolution is also poor and the images often seem overexposed - but, and this is important, the images don't shake at 10X with the IS on! and the actual pictures are correctly exposed. The swiveling LCD screen grows on you and you can take pictures looking down at the camera at waist level.  The grandchildren may not even realize you are actually taking their picture, adding to the candid effect. I haven't found the lack of an autofocusing lamp to be a problem in dim light and you can always set the manual focus to about 8 feet (no zoom used) and everything from 4 feet to infinitity will be sharp.  (I got this tidbit from my research).<br />After it was announced but before it was readily available the camera received so-so reviews but the recent user reviews from those who actually own and use one have been highly favorable and I agree with them.  It's well made, not too heavy, and the basics can be learned quickly.  Advanced users can find many features to investigate and I'm still learning how to use some of the exposure and focus lock modes for special cases.  I think that using the Auto mode (or the Program P mode) with IS on will work for most people, most of the time.  And, as an added bonus, you can even take movies (9 minutes/1GB at best quality) if you have a large memory.  I'm glad I discovered this \"fun\" camera.","I reviewed quite a few cameras before settling on this one. Key selling points were 10x optical zoom with image stabilizer (need stabilizer for 10x zoom, based on feedback from other camera users), swivel LCD, ergonomics, compact size (did not want to have to carry a bulky SLR camera everywhere), and manual control options. Only spec. downside was 3M Pixels, but in practice with a 10x zoom you will seldom crop pictures for enlargement, as you would with other cameras.<br />I have had the camera for a month, have taken approx. 300 pictures, and I am thrilled.","I see there are reviews here that seem to indicate the S1 is an unreliable camera. Well, mine has performed reliably during the (admittedly) short time I've owned it. 500+ pictures and counting!<br /><br /> LIKES: Amazing image quality for having only 3.2MP; incredible 38-380 mm lens zoom range; outstanding VGA movie mode; fairly priced; uses fairly cheap Compact Flash media; swivel LCD is a great idea.<br /><br /> DISLIKES: Weak flash; no dedicated macro mode; movie mode works best with more expensive 'high speed' CF cards.<br /><br /> Overall, a great camera. The highs definitely outweigh the lows. I very much recommend this camera.","I took about 300 pictures with my S1 before I sent it back.  It had a bright red \"Stuck Pixel\" in every shot.  I tried to live with it by editing on the PC,turned out to be a big hassle.<br />Pros-<br />10X zoom, 32X combined zoom<br />Very portable<br />Swivel LCD<br />Great movie mode.<br />Ergonomics are very good.<br />Image stabilzation works well.<br />Good overall picture quality<br />Cons-<br />Lens Cap falls off easily.<br />LCD and EVF very hard to see in bright sunlight.<br />Manual focus could be better.<br />Pictures have alot of noise in certain environments regardless of camera settings.<br />Requires a large/fast CF/MD card for the movie mode to be of any use.<br />Use the supplied AA batteries in something else, get some NiMH rechargables(my 2400mha batteries last a long time).<br />No onboard camera function for ccd mapping, like other makes.<br />I have order a replacement S1 for my sick one.  I am giving Canon one more chance with the S1. I like the camera very much,  If this one is not right a Panasonic FZ10 may be in my future.","After researching other cameras in its class including the Panasonic DMC-FZ10 and Konica Minolta DiMAGE Z2, I finally decided on the Canon S1 IS. Having taken a few hundred pictures with it, I am completely satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />With this camera I have the flexibility to take pictures with point-and-shoot ease while also having plenty of manual capabilities available to take more artistic pictures. Although the camera has \"only\" 3.2 megapixels this is more than compensated for by the 10x optical zoom. With this zoom you simply don't need as many megapixels (although it would be nice) because you won't be cropping out as much of the picture. Instead of cropping out excess, you just zoom in while you are there and have a nice original to begin with. Furthemore, more megapixels don't necessarily mean a \"better\" picture. There are other factors like the lens, cmos, and other processing that will affect the image quality just as much as the megapixels if not more.<br /><br />Image stabilization is an awesome feature and until now has been reserved for the more expensive cameras. This feature definitely helps with the long zooms and low-light conditions. With the long zoom you can do shots where the primary object is very clear while the background is all blurry. This isn't as easy to do on cameras with less zoom.<br /><br />The physical layout and the menu interface are excellent. The placement of the buttons are very intuitive and the menu setup is among the best I've ever used on any electronic device. It allows me to use all the manual settings with ease and speed. I can't really think of any better way to set it up.<br /><br />Although the viewfinders tend to make images look like they are overexposed I think that as the viewfinder ages and dims (as any LCD will do over time) the picture will improve and not look as overexposed. So, I think it is excellent foresight on Canon's part to make the pictures seem overexposed. Personally, I don't find it to be a major issue because I view all the pics on my computer before deleting them anyway. The swiveling LCD is a feature that is indispensible. Not only does it protect the LCD if you flip it around, but you can take pictures of yourself (or others next to you) or and you take pictures at weird angles (such as close to the ground or high above a crowd) without contorting yourself.<br /><br />I don't find battery power to be an issue. Just get 2 or 3 sets of NiMH batteries and you should be fine for a long day of heavy shooting. Plus the fact that you can use AA instead of a proprietary module means you can use regular AA alkaline batteries in a pinch.<br /><br />The movie mode is great not only because of the high quality movies, but also because you can zoom while taking the movie. Most cameras will not let you zoom and you have to leave it where it is. The only downside is that you will need a high-speed compact flash card (like the Sandisk Ultra II) to take the highest quality movies. Slower cards can't keep up with the high amout of data being written.<br /><br />The focusing system is also great and not usually found on cameras at this level. You can move the autofocus box to any postion you want and set an autofocus lock so it doesn't change once you've set it. You can also use the manual focus if you can't get a good focus in low-light situations. There is a meter that pops up showing the approximate distance to the object that you want to focus to which is quite helpful. With the manual focus, I've been able to focus on any object without too much trouble.<br /><br />There are only 2 things I would like to see improved. One would be some sort of battery meter but it would be wildly inaccurate without some sort of proprietary battery (which they don't make you use) so I'm ok with them leaving that out. I would also like the lens cap to 'click' on instead of just sliding on. I understand why they made that decision though: they want the cap to slide off automatically when you turn it on which is a convenience so I don't have to take it off every time I turn it on. These are just minor suggestions and really just personal preference things. Otherwise, this camera is perfect for the price and what you get.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera to anyone to both point-and-shoot people and people who want that along with some artistic flexibility. The feature set is unbeatable and the picture quality is amazing.<br /><br />[...]","I've been researching digital cameras for a while now and was originally going to get the Canon EOS Rebel 6.3 MP Digital SLR and then stumbled upon this one.<br />I love photography but I don't want to have to spend more time adjusting everything than taking pictures and this S1 is fantastic.  It's very easy to use and much smaller and more portable than I expected.<br />The only downfall is battery usage.  This camera takes 4 AA batteries and they end up fully depleted after a couple hours of use.  I've since converted to rechargeable AA's and I just make sure that I've got a couple extra sets just in case.<br />There are so many options to choose from and you can do just about anything with this camera that you could do with a full fledged SLR.  The digital zoom allows for a max of 32X and I've taken medium quality pictures at 32X and they've come out very clear and the built in stabilizer function really does take the edge off.<br />I highly recommend this camera.","I have used the Canon Powershot IS 1 for over a month and have shot many 100's of images with it.<br />The good points:<br />*Produces beautiful images under most conditions.<br />*The image stabilization system works very well. You are able to take sharp pictures down to 1/6 sec in the wide angle position.<br />*I used it exclusively at Disney World for the Epcot International Flower Show and thought the night exposures were wonderful. No flash, just hand held photography.<br />*The movie mode works well under the difficult lighting conditions encountered at the night time parade at Magic Kingdom.<br />*The color saturation was beautiful. I used the Program mode mostly at ISO equivalent of 100 and the Vivid setting.<br />*The noise was minimal with the 100 ISO setting. The advantage is higher shutter speeds to stop the action.<br />*I was able to set the depth of field in Aperture mode for good garden bed shots.<br />*The 10/1 zoom is incredible!<br />The bad points:<br />*The Electronic viewfinder is terrible! The resolution, sharpness, color accuracy and saturation of the finder make you wonder what Canon was thinking of. An optical viewfinder is 100% better.<br />*The finder blanks out when going from dark to bright outside subjects, making fast picture taking impossible under many instances.<br />*The resolution is so bad that it is difficult to see if the focus is right on. It usually was.<br />*The Canon A-70 is a better camera for faster picture taking. However, the anti- shake and 10/1 zoom override all other considerations for me.<br />*The LCD viewer on the back of the camera is useless in the bright light and its color accuracy is terrible too. I have taken many beautiful sunsets and you cannot see the red sun in the viewfinder or on the monitor. HOWEVER the resultant images were spectacular when viewed on the computer screen.<br />*The battery consumption seemed to be higher than the A-70 but I did not do a very accurate test. I used two sets of NiMH batteries in a full day of shooting at Epcot. However I was shooting in movie mode some of the time and using a 1 GB flash cards to hold the many images. All the images were taken with the best quality jpg settings.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the camera is very good for most picture taking opportunities, but is no good for fast moving objects such as flying birds.<br />Forget what you do not see in the viewfinder or the viewer and shoot away.<br />The big thing here is to have faith!<br />I give the camera 4 out of 5 points.<br />NEW! I just had to change the Time/Date battery. My instruction manual is WRONG!! The battery goes in with the (+)positive terminal up.<br />Fred Sgrosso<br /><br />fsgrosso@hotmail.com","For starters let me just say that I am by no means a pro-photo man. I enjoy the everyday kind of photo taking that most of us do. This was my first digi cam and to tell you the truth it is a little overwhelming at first. But Canon has done a great job with making it fairly simple to figure it all out. When you first get the cam they pretty much have it all on auto, including the software that it comes with. So by the time you get around to reading the manual you have already taken pictures, downloaded them on your cpu, and printed them out. As I am sure I am not alone with the sickness of, play with it first and read it all later. I espeacially like that fact that you really can't mess this camera up to bad with all the functions that it has. (trust me I tried) It is so simple to fix it, all you have to do is turn it off and it resets. But for those of you who like to keep certain common settings there is a setting for you too. If you're reading this review to find out what all the camera can do, well to be honest I really don't know. What I do know is that if you're looking for a camera that takes great photos and movies with the option of getting lens adapters, look no further. This camera will be one that you will be able to learn on while taking pictures all the while. One thing is for sure, the quality of the pictures you get from this camera will test your printer's limits. I am currently chastizing mine as you read this and am gonna have to up grade! But before you go out and buy the S1 you should seriously think about get more memory and rechargable batteries for it. Hope this helps you make a decision, and have fun with taking photos. Cause lets face it, since it's digital it doesn't cost you a thing to retake the pictures!<br /><br /> God bless our troops!!!!!!!!","I have long wanted a digital camera, this is my first. It allows for manual control of all settings (ISO, focus, shutter, aperature, exposure compensation, white balance, etc). Manual control over these settings makes for FUN photography (things maybe you never played with much on a 35mm because of film costs). The camera feels really wonderful in my hand; I could never get used to the pocket sized digital cameras, this has a pro-like grip, and the body is a very comfortable size (smaller than a pro SLR, but bigger than the average point and shoot digital camera).<br />A few things that I don't like about the camera so far:<br />While you can adjust focus manually, it's all done within the digital display via button pushing. I'd much prefer adjusting focus physically (ie by turning the lense fixture).  Some digital cameras allow for this.<br />Movie mode delivers spectacular quality videos! but I found adjusting focus while shooting movies can be impossible (it appears you must rely on auto focus in movie mode). Virtually every setting is configured automatically in movie mode, which makes movies something I will avoid with this camera (but I didn't expect to get a video camera anyway, so not a big con here).<br />The USB connection to the PC from the camera uses a special connector on the camera. This connection is very small, and it is difficult to insert the USB wire into it. I'm afraid something might break if this connection is used often. A Compact Flash card reader might be the best solution here, but that puts extra wear on your memory card :\\<br />No AC adapter included ... only a 32MB Compact Flash card included (which will only hold something like 20 images on the highest quality setting).<br />Overall, I am very happy with this camera as my first digital camera. I think it's shortcomings are very acceptable for the price tag. My photos are stunning! I'm a pro photographer over night!","This camera delivers exactly what I expected.  I sold both my mini dv movie camera and other digital camera and replaced it with this.  The highlights:<br />+ The movie mode is the crowning achievement of this camera.  Theh movies are fantastic, and most importantly are recorded on a CF card, which loads right onto my PC.  No transferring video from a camcorder.  This is the #1 reason I changed cameras.<br />+ The shot quality is outstanding.  Crystal clear and colors are great.<br />+  The zoom is outstanding.  Combine it with the image stabilizer and it's just fantastic.<br />+ The controls.  Easy to learn, use and understand.<br />The negatives:<br />- When you push the button half way down to shoot, it will not follow your subject with you.  I have two kids who don't stay still.  When i depressed the button to take the picture on my old camera, i could follow my subject as it moved, and when it could lock into focus, it would.  What you have to end up doing is focus on a stationary object at the same distance/focal length as the moving object you want to shoot.  Get it to lock in focus and then move over to your moving object and shoot it.  It's really not that bad, but not ideal either.<br />- only 3.2 mp.  I sure wish it was 5.<br />- electronic zoom.  I had manual zoom with my last camera and that was outstanding.  It was so precise and I could zoom at the speed I wanted.<br />- no low light auto-focus assist lamp.  What this means is that if you're shooting in low light, it takes about 1.5 seconds for it to focus.  If you're shooting kids or something moving, that is not easy.<br />Bottom line is that all the important qualities in a camera are here, and the movie mode is awesome.  If you're looking for the perfect camera, trust me, it doesn't exist.  Image quality is great - the price is right - and you can't lose with this shooter.","Hi everbody,<br />First of all, I was fortunate enough to get this camera from Adorama Cameras for $374.00 plus shipping.  Must have been some sort of introductory special on Amazon.  Got the camera about a week after ordering.  Let me say that this is my 4th digital camera and I regard this as the best I have had so far.  I have owned both Olympus and Minolta digital cameras prior to buying the Canon S1 IS.  I want to say that Canon definitely thought out the ergonomics and the feel of this camera.  It feels very comfortable and sturdy (I'm right handed.  It is clear that they did not skimp on workmanship  I love the smoothness of the 10x Optical zoom (that's reason I wanted a good long zoom camera)and there was no blurriness thanks to the Image Stabiliser.  I recommend if you are taking shots and you are zooming in at 3X or greater on the optical zoom, engage the IS.  I don't recommend using digital zoom on any digital camera, it is always easier using photo editing software to crop your photos.  I tried the camera at a couple of family outings and I was definitely impressed.  I was a bit concerned about it being only 3.2MP but the pictures I took looked better than my sister's 4MP Kodak camera.  The auto mode works fairly well and the LCD certainly shows good detail in bright sunlight but be warned, have the display set at full brightness especially if you are using the EVF outside.  There are only 2 display brightness settings.  The photos I took had good contrast and very vibrant colors.  There was some very slight purple fringing on some shots I took with the optical zoom at maximum.  You may need to adjust the exposure setting if you are trying to photograph a subject that is on a background that doesn't contrast well.  I also found that you definitely need rechargeable AA batteries, especially if you are running the LCD screen and if you are running the camera in movie mode.  That reminds me, the movie mode is incredible but you need at least a 1GB card to record anything substantial at 30 fps.  I recommend if you can afford it, get the 4GB microdrive.  I have heard that you can take the microdrive out of the Muvo2 4GB player and use it in the camera since the S1 accepts CompactFlash Type II cards if you know how to do it right.  With so many different modes, this camera will definitely grow with you.  I wished that Canon had put a flash hot shoe on this camera but I can understand them not trying to create a light stripped down version of the EOS Rebel.  Indoors, the flash is above average compared to other digital long zooms but could still be better, it will illuminate your subject.  The camera AF did slow down somewhat in very dim lighting, make sure to run it in night scene mode, not auto.  The extra long exposure lag definitely improves the shots and just to be fair, the low light performance was certainly superior to other digital cameras I have owned.  I do like the fact that Canon included a nice get started quickly template but the manual could be better organized.  For most people, I would say using it in auto is fine but if you like to tinker, the full manual mode is a lot of fun.  All in all, a good buy despite the fact that Canon should have also included a AF assist lamp which surprised me somewhat since they put them on most every camera they make.  Well, that just leaves room for improvement I guess.  Now, I gotta get back to shooting some more pictures.  Auf Wiedersehen!","This camera just feels better than the cheaper priced models. It doesn't feel like your holding a $200- 500 piece of plastic in your hands. The picture quality is outstanding, and the turn around time to take another picture is excellent.<br />The movie mode does eat up space on the compact flash card, and I think the 1 GB flash cards are very overpriced. But the movies come out better than my camcorder.<br />The swiveling LCD is also a very nice feature. This camera might be a but pricey for a 3.1 MP, but worth every cent that you spend. I can't imagine any disappointments with this Camera. Its smaller than what it appears in pictures.<br />I have zero complaints about this camera, and I can always find something to complain about.","Hi,<br />I just picked up my Canon S1 an simply love it.  The feel of it is very sturdy in your hands and feels well constructed.  The controls are very nicely placed.  You could easily handle this camera with one hand.  The zoom control is nice and fast, it takes a bit to get used to how touchy it can be, but easlily controlled once you get the hang of it.  The colors look great for outdoor shots, and indoor shots as well.  The AF(Auto Focus) seems to pick up indoors quite nicely, except for really low light areas, as i've usually had problems with my Fuji and other cameras, the Canon seems to focus more easily.  Plus you can see thru the LCD or viewfinder indoors as well very nicely.  You also get a 32mb CF with the camera, which is nice, but of course can fill up fast.  I suggest picking up at least a 256mb card, Costco has Sandisk 256 for around $41.  As for the menus, very easily done and easy to navigate thru.  I also love the MF (manual focus) on the S1.  You can't use it in Auto, but can in all other settings.  Where I couldnt focus with the AF, I could easlily focus with the MF.  I love the the LCD screen swivel capabilities also.  I'm looking forward to shooting above crowds while being able to see what im shooting at.  The 10X optical zoom is wonderful, and combined with the Image Stabilizer, is just near perfect.<br />The cost of this 3.2 MP camera may seem alittle overpriced, but with the super bright LCD swivel screen (easily viewed in daylight), the Image Stailizer and the 10X optical zoom, and the 640 x 480 @ 30 fps video, \"automatic pop-up flash\", indoor low light capabilities and nice overall construction, plus a ton of other features, you will know its worth every penny.<br />I almost went for the Minolta Z2, but the construction of that camera seemed very poor as the lens it self felt like it was going to fall out. Also when shooting video with the Minolta, the AF sound constantly was picked up in the video, making that a completely useless feature. Not so with the Canon S1, the USM zoom feature is that, Ultra Silent and so is the AF.  Not one sound is picked up while shooting video with the S1.  The Minolta did do great shots as well, but I finally went for the Canon for the sturdy construction and more readily available accessories, such as a underwater housing and optional remote control.<br />Also as a side note, I really like the way you can customize the sounds in the camera under \"My Camera\".  Having a bird chird or dog bark, its just the icing on the cake.  I'm trying to make a Disney theme for my camera before vacation...I'm glad that companies such as Canon really know how to let the customer feel like its there very own camera, instead of just another cookie cutter gadget.<br />Honestly, the only cons of this camera is maybe the price, and that is easlily justified with the attention to detail Canon has given this camera.<br />I would highly recommend anyone to go out and give this camera a run though, you wont be disappointed.  Anyone can use this camera,very user friendly.  This camera will give you and your family many years of great memories...<br />Thanks Canon..."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot Pro1","amazon_reviews":["Replacement for my old PowerShot Pro1.

THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING LITTLE OPTICAL MACHINES I'VE EVER OWNED.  There, I've said it. Now I'll get down to the pro's and cons of owning what I consider could have been one of Canon's crowning achievements.<br /><br />I bought the first one in 2008.  I had a love hate relationship with it.  So why be annoyed by something I've grown to like so much?  Well, it is slow and limited in doing what it does. Focusing time, shot to shot recovery, zooming, vga video quality and recording time, and a flip out viewfinder that makes the photo masterpiece you just recorded look like trash.  So what's to love?  Well, it's the indisputable, undeniable quality of the images rendered through that professional grade \"L\" series lens and the high quality 8MP CCD! Bottom line, the photos rival my Canon 60d DSLR with the high end \"L\" grade glass I own.  It will shock you --I mean blow you away -- the first time you see your photos on a high def computer screen or HD TV after viewing them in the low resolution screen of the Pro 1 viewfinder.  I recently slapped a little Canon speedlite into the hot shoe of the Pro 1 and took snapshots at my Granddaughter's Wedding (as a backup to the professional that they hired.)  She (the Pro) had a Canon 40d and a couple pieces of redline glass.  Don't get me wrong, she took some beautiful photos.  But guess what....When we made a side by side comparison of her professional shots and the snapshots rendered by my old Pro 1, there was very little if any difference and in fact, the Pro 1 won hands-down in sharpness, color, and contrast -for some shots--without any touchup whatsoever.  I made a slide show of my snapshots for my granddaughter and she was blown away. Wow Papaw, your photos look better than .............'s.<br /><br />Built like a tank, the capabilities of this little high-end Powershot are extensive.  You can read about them in the specifications so I won't bore you with it.  But I can say this - it is an understated and elegant example of what the Canon folks can do by combining some of their best glass with great electronics in a compact \"bridge\" type non-dslr.  I don't think that has happened very often.  Sure, it's got some drawbacks.  The slow processor, the odd zoom by wire telephoto lens, and the use of the slow compact digital card format, and the low resolution of the articulated viewfinder to name a few.  But I have come to appreciate the unrelenting, undeniable quality of the images to the extent that I save this one for really special occasions like weddings and graduations where the weight and slowness of the camera are worth the patience.  Course, for anything requiring speed like sports or wildlife, you would be out of luch anyway.<br /><br />At one time, I gave my first Pro 1 to my daughter.....I wanted to upgrade to some of Canon's new \"faster\" stuff.  I regreted it so badly that when she dropped it and bent the flash hot shoe and stopped using it in favor of a new (smaller) Powershot, I asked if I could have it back. I then sent it to the Canon store and had the hot shoe replaced.  It's been working fine since.  I recently got worried about what would happen if I lost it or it got broken beyond repair - soooo, I went to Amazon and bought a used one in like new condition for $175 (original costs in the range of $800).  Yep, I plan to keep these little jewels in my stable until I don't take pictures any more.<br /><br />If you can find one in good shape - BUY IT!  It's a great bargain.  My bet is, you'll learn to like it.","I've had this camera for about five years.  In general I really like it.<br /><br />Let me start with the downsides first.  Like most small-sensor cameras there is a LOT of noise at high ASA.  And by high, I mean 200 and above.  So I leave mine on ASA 100 all the time.  The result is that outdoors, or indoors with good light everything is wonderful.  But low light...  very long exposures so have a tripod ready and hope your subject isn't moving.<br /><br />The autofocus is very poor in low light;  it hunts back and forth and often can't find proper focus.  Manual focus in low light is tough too.  In good light it focuses properly but is a bit slower than newer cameras, which can be an issue if your subject is moving.<br /><br />Another weakness is the long delay between pushing the shutter release and when it takes the photo.  You can minimize this a bit by pushing the button half way, which will initiate the focusing and exposure setting.  Then when  you push it the rest of the way it is fairly responsive.<br /><br />Aside from these drawbacks, this camera is wonderful.  I love the way it feels in my hands, I love the flexibility it gives me, I love the ability to shoot in RAW, and the ability to put the camera in jpeg mode but switch to RAW for individual shots after you take them (you have a few seconds to do this).<br /><br />I love the way the camera feels in my hands;  the controls feel very natural to me and it is easy to change settings as needed from shot to shot.  It hangs nicely from the neck strap and battery life is pretty good.<br /><br />I LOVE the articulating screen;  it makes it very easy when shooting from very high or low angles, which improve many photos.  It also works great for shooting candid shots of people;  you can put the camera at your belt and compose/take photos without your subjects realizing you are taking their photo.<br /><br />The image quality is excellent in good light.  The scenic photos I've taken with this camera are quite sharp, and 28-200 zoom range is perfect.  So for travel photography I think this is a perfect camera;  much smaller, lighter and easier to carry than an SLR with lenses, and for most travel shots the image quality is comparable.<br /><br />Compared to the images from my A-series point/shoot cameras, the Pro1 is hugely better.  It is sharper, the color saturation is better, the blacks seem blacker and the whites seem whiter.<br /><br />I have not had any problems with dirt in the lens or on the sensor although some have reported this problem.  If you do a lot of photography in dusty/dirty environments beware of this.<br /><br />I wish Canon had continued to evolve this camera to improve the low-light and autofocus systems, but they have not.<br /><br />There was a firmware upgrade in late 2004 that significantly improved the camera in many ways;  be sure your Pro1 has the upgrade.

It had an option to shoot jpeg but you had 10 seconds to keep it as RAW instead if you really liked the photo. Never ever seen that in another camera ever. Compact is the way to go too if you want high depth of field like I do for night architecture. Came with a remote control too. Loved the articulating LCD screen which Canon really should put on their DSLRs -it just makes sense if you have Live View mode. Oh well, that's the deal with digital cameras -you never get to keep one for too long.","I should start out saying I love this camera.  Canon PowerShot Pro 1 8MP Digital Camera with 7x Optical Zoom It is sturdy, well-made and feels solid in my hands.  It is a perfect size and weight and I have had nothing but exceptional results.  There is a fairly powerful zoom with macro capability and the photos are of high enough quality and resolution that you can do substantial cropping without losing quality,  yet they don't hog the memory card (which is a Compact Flash, something I also like).  The camera worked really until recently, when the shutter release decided to get stuck, halfway in the down position, so you have to press really hard to take the picture.  I contacted Canon (of course, it is out of warranty) and they blamed me for either dropping it or spilling coke on it.  (I did neither.)  My question is whether or not I pay to get it fixed.  It is still functional, but it takes a lot of effort to take the picture. I've been pleased with Canon products in the past and this unit has been my favorite.  I will probably break down and get it fixed, since there are so many great features.","After having about 35 years of accumulated Canon (film) equipment taken from my truck I had a choice: stay with film, or go digital.  I started with a digital Canon because I'm familiar with the way they think a camera should work, I'm sure a Nikon would have been as good a choice, but I started with Canon.  And worked my way up through a series of cameras to the Pro 1.  If you have never used their `L' series glass, you will be astonished at how fast, crisp, clean, and clear it is.  The 28-200 zoom is nice.  You will get a lot from this camera, but pushing 8 megapixels to a large `professional' sized print is difficult.  Everything everyone has said is pretty much true.<br /><br />The:<br /><br />** Good: L series glass, OPTICAL zoom, good range in zoom, STRONG flash, exceptionally nice smaller prints.  Will take long - tripod needed -shots in the multiple seconds range. can be used point and shoot or full manual.<br /><br />** Average: Battery life is average so have a spare (or two), and I've been told many, many times that I DO need to stick with Canon Batteries by people I respect - so ditch the 10 for $100 non Canon batteries and stick with Canon.  I've been given many reasons when I have my yearly cleaning and tune up of my cameras and lenses (only because I treat them rough and use them in hostile environments (like the Great Basins and Ranges in the Summer heat and dust and the Winter cold and grit and wet).  The best reason I've been given is that non-canon batteries may 1) lose their re-charge life significantly faster because they are often made of re-cycled materials that have not been cleaned up very well, and probably most important, they tend to leak if left too long without use or charge.  This will destroy your camera right then and there - and I have noticed that one bunch of `money saving' batteries DID start to leak (first sign is the copper beginning to turn a greenish brown, before the green really shows up) after only about 3 weeks of charge-discharge cycles. Didn't save much on those batteries, AND I needed to carry 5 or 6 with one in the charger all the time to do a full day shoot. So now I cowboy up for name brand batteries. I don't like it, but people who know say I need to stay with Canon batteries, and all they do is repair optical equipment, they sell ONLY service on things from microscopes to cameras, no tangible products of any kind, and that's about as neutral as you'll get. It doesn't seem it would matter, but it does.<br /><br />** Bad: slow to boot up, hard or impossible to auto-focus in low light, WILL freeze sometimes in low light or low battery, if you accidentally remove the card while it's on, you'll erase the entire card, poor quality large prints, flash often TOO powerful and I have to `bounce' it off a home-made white card double bounce contraption and it almost always needs to `bounce' for inside diffusion and even distribution of light.  But a simple 3x5 card will do that nicely, but side angle bounce flash is nearly impossible -- sometimes you can use a bent 3x5 card, but it's very awkward and often the card will show up in the frame unless you pay very close attention to it, and focusing and holding a card is ALMOST impossible.  Might as well forget wild-life photography, by the time you pull up your camera, turn it on, wait for it to boot, and then get a focus, that Osprey is now on the other side of the canyon, or that deer is most likely behind a tree or rock or has taken it's four bounds and is now just a dot in the zoom lens.  And that Bald Eagle on the fence post about 50 feet away is now in Utah or Oregon at 20,000 feet.  The way you counter this problem is to keep the camera on and not let it go to sleep -- draining your batteries every second. Count birds out, large mammals as maybes, and landscapes as certainties. Portraits are as good as you are in normal light. I don't shoot portraits, so this is a neutral point for me.<br /><br />** EXCEPTIONAL!!!! I got distracted by my dogs while shooting a sunset scene of a Nevada Mountain Range and had it mounted by one of those `spider' pods to the brush guard on my old Toyota Land Cruiser.  I got in and drove away and at about 40-45 MPH hit a small pot hole on the dirt road and heard a funny sound and looked out my passenger-side mirror and saw the black box of the camera rolling across the dirt. Dang!<br /><br />When I got back to the camera there was a very small roundish crack in the top where it had first hit hard pan, then bounced across some gravel and into some sand where it came to rest in an old bitter brush bush.  IF I'd sealed it right away it would have stayed, but I didn't and in about a month the place where it had cracked fell off, showing some of the electrical parts inside, and I sealed this with some plastic and glue.  When I sent it off for it's cleaning a bit early - they said other than the normal amount of grit and dust they'd normally find, there was no other damage to the camera, lens or focusing mechanism. Wow.  Well built is an understatement.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE:<br />1)....I AM ASTOUNDED AT HOW WELL BUILT AND SOLID THIS CAMERA IS!<br />2)....If you want to REALLY learn photography, this is the camera to buy.  It'll let you be lazy and use it as a point and shoot, but you can also move to manual settings, AND it has a macro setting so you get close-up and personal -- and with the L series glass you the best of both worlds: point-and-shoot to almost-true-pro with super fast glass (this means you can hand-hold in lower light and not need a flash).  Every shot is free until you print it. So take the shot, the only way to learn is to take the shot -- the worst that will happen is you'll throw it away. And I have to admit that seeing your image captured right away will improve your ability as a photographer faster than any film camera will, I probably learned as much in the first month of owning this camera as I had in the previous 35 years - but I also read the manual.  AND, this camera will teach you all of the little things you need to know so you can `trick' the brain of digital cameras in general.<br /><br />3)....I've just bought a Canon 5D with a set of lenses and while I have now learned my way through the beginnings of digital photography starting with simple and moving to the top of the `amateur' cameras, I can now move to a mid-real pro camera and know what I need and what I don't.  But I would not hesitate to carry this as a `backup' or use it in places that I'd not want to take my several thousand dollar camera and lenses or lug 5-10-25 pounds of glass. AND only if I wanted prints that were smaller than 11x17. At 11x17\" you are pushing the camera to, and maybe just a tad beyond it's maximum resolution limit.<br /><br />*****FINAL SCORE: 4.70 STARS*****","To start, I would like to note that I had purchased this camera in 2004 and took over 70,000 images so far with it. Back those days nothing better existed on the market. Still no one beats the unique combination of features this camera provides: small and light-weight, L-lens with 7x zoom (and as the result - amazing quality of images), video recording, flipping Life-view screen, durable aluminum body, top LCD, etc. It took Canon over 4 years to integrate some (but not all) of the Pro1 features into the latest DSLR. Sure, this camera is useless for night-photography but other then that - this single unique device can satisfy any and all needs as a walk-around camera delivering uncompromising image quality, something you can get only by investing at least 3-5K in to DSLR.","Canon made a masterpiece at that time, it is a very well thought and designed camera. Though it may look outdated now, but even now no one will match its potential. All in one camera, I am not ready to leave it at any cost.","I've used this camera pretty heavily for about a year, mostly for travelling.  I've used it for candids, landscapes, action, and wildlife.  Previously, my photo experience has been with Canon point and shoot digicams and Nikon film slrs.  It's a bit unfair reviewing this now that it's almost 3-yr old technology, but I noticed that people are still selling this camera for over $1000 on this site.<br /><br />For a \"pro\" camera, it has a large number of critical flaws (listed in order of how much they bug me):<br /><br />1) slow focusing esp in low light.  This renders the camera almost useless for action, and difficult to use for wildlife and even candids, where capturing the moment is everything.  The focusing may be faster in continous mode, but then its always focusing and you have to keep the subject centered-- I like to not be looking in the viewfinder unless I'm about to take a picture.  I don't own a canon accesory flash so I don't know if their focusing aids help.  The manual focusing on the EVF display is too slow and cumbersome to use routinely.<br /><br />2) slow shutter lag.  Even on manual focus, with problem 1 taken out of the picture, there is a bit too much delay to consistently capture the shot I'm looking for.<br /><br />3) Dust gets _inside_ the lens.  I have read that this is a problem with this camera.  Canon was good enough to rectify this when I sent it in, and they even said they sealed the lens to prevent the problem from happening.  My brother has the same camera and this happened within 2 weeks of a trip to Europe-- not especially dusty.  Unfortunately his is out of warranty so I don't know if they will do the same.<br /><br />4)) hi noise at ISO 200 or 400.  I think with commercially available noise reduction software this is a bit repairable.  To be fair, the grain of most 400 speed color film can be as unattractive as the noise of this sensor at ISO 400.  Since digital SLR's with less grain at ISO 1600 are now available, I don't think anyone should be selling this camera for $1000.<br /><br />5) bayonet mount on front of lens scratches filters when used with included 58mm adapter.  My $50 polarizer is now dedicated to use with this camera since with other lenses the scratches are in the optical axis.<br /><br />6) built in flash pics are harsh.  This is a problem with any built-in flash on any camera.  Again I have no canon accessory flash to compare, so I can't really comment on this as a negative for a pro camera.<br /><br />On the plus side, the camera does some things amazingly well:<br /><br />1) super macro is quite impressive, even though 8mp or raw isn't possible.<br /><br />2) the regular macro works pretty well.<br /><br />3) it's a pretty compact solution for a 28-200 lens equivalent.  The equivalent SLR is a lot bigger, though maybe not much heavier.  I don't know how the lens quality of the pro 1 \"L\" lens compares to the non-L SLR lenses.  You definitely won't find an affordable f2.8 SLR zoom lens for an attractive price (not a Canon at least).  The lens is pretty good-- little distortion except at 28mm and little chromatic aberration.  A hint of vignetting at 28mm as well.<br /><br />4) It's ultra quiet.  When I mute all the sounds, it makes only barely perceptible aperature noises.<br /><br />5) the rotating lcd allows for true WYSIWYG composition from different angles, allowing for some stealthy shots and also good for macro stuff.<br /><br />6) really great depth of field (I haven't objectively tested this so I don't know if the 7.2mm objective actually has better depth of field than an effective 28mm on an slr)<br /><br />Taking into account it's strengths and weaknesses, I use the camera for travelling and taking landscapes when I don't want to carry around a big slr for the super wides.  It's smaller and quieter than an slr and better for the surreptious candids, esp with the rotatable LCD.  It'd probably be a good macro-specific camera but I haven't used the macro flash.  For most uses, it can't possibly be worth it if fast-handling, low noise SLR with equivalent lens is available for the same cost or cheaper.  I got it as a gift before lightweight travelling so it was great for that, but I'm looking to buy an SLR now.","I bought this camera used at a consignment shop over a year ago, my second digital camera after losing my Samsung in Mexico. Battery life is great, and the battery charger was with it. The only bad thing I could find was lens cap had no string, and not USB 2.0. Canon's software package was it's usuall fantastic set. Took hundreds of pics with this camera, and resolution was just awesome.<br /><br />Ran over the camera with my 1965 Mustang, and still take pictures with it. Beat that with any other camera!!! I will only buy Canon, also have a PowerShot A520 and A530. Love them all.","I have used several digital camera's in the past including more expensive Digital SLR's but this is by far the easiest to use to obtain fantastic results WITH the ease of point and shoot.<br /><br />I think the reviewers that were having problems with the camera's have not updated their camera's firmware and they also have not taken the time to read on how to best take a low light photograph or an action photo.  If you want to get fancy with extra lenses and such this is NOT the camera to use.  For the other 90% of the population, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the PowerShot Pro 1.<br /><br />I'm an investigator and use this camera on an almost daily basis in criminal cases where we use the pics for evidence and ultimately trial.  At 8mp, the best quality photographs can be enlarged to poster size proportions with little degradation of the quality.  It's battery life is fantastic and it has handled the daily wear and tear from frequent use quite nicely.","This is a great camera for anyone that realy wants to take a very good, high resolution pix. The zoon lens is also a very good item.<br /><br /> I am a realtor and I take a lot of picture. With the zoom lens it is usually not necessary for me to get out of the car to take a professional picture.<br /><br /> I would also recomed that you purchase an additional battery for the camera. The reason being is that is is very convenent to have an additional battery to replace the one in the camera once it is low on charge.","i've been shooting for close to 30 years, had several great dependable cameras and this one has lived up to almost all my expectations. true it does have several minor quirks, but the range of performance has exceeded my demanding standards. the quality of the optics, the compact size and versatility of function have made it a great 'street shooting' machine. if your looking for serious low light or killer speed it might not serve your needs, but i wished i had bought two for i have had nothing but great days in all weather conditions, putting this little gem through it's paces on the streets of new york! two years of consistent performance!","I bought this camera slightly used on ebay for $499.00, and I love it!!!!<br />I still have a Fuji 3.1 Mega Pixel camera - my wife has 2 digital Kodak cameras and the pictures on this Cannon are unbelievable!  I bought this Cannon camera, because I already own a Canon XL1, GL1 & GL2 camcorders (I do wedding videography - [...] & the settings are very similar.<br />Once annoyance is the lack of a lens cap string.<br />Battery life is excellent.","This camera is used for taking pictures of lab experiments, conference photos, and office activities.  We are very satisfied with all uses.","Great camera which produces superb quality digital imaging. You will find a few of the images it has produced so far in the neighbouring site.<br />I have a couple of gripes with the design of the lens hood/filter adapter area of this camera.<br />The filter adapter is made of fairly flimsy black plastic. Any filter screwed on to it - and I tried both a 58mm UV and a 58mm polarizing filter - jams on the adapter. (No, I did not cross the threading!)<br />Once the filter and adapter are clicked on to the lens, it is no longer possible to attach the petal shaped lens hood. Using any other off-the-shelf lens hood, for instance a circular one, intrudes on the image.<br />On all my cameras I use a UV filter to protect the lens from scratching - it is cheaper to replace a UV filter than an expensive lens - but in the case of the Powershot Pro, attaching the filter and adapter, mean that without the lens hood being able to be attached in their presence, any backlit images are compromised by unwanted light hitting the lens.<br /><br />Canon Design team: Go to the bottom of the class for this poor design feature.<br />It has let down an otherwise excellent little camera. With the one adapter supplied jammed on to one filter, an adapter for each filter I use, may be the solution, but it does not solve the lack of attachment point for the lens hood, when a filter is in use...I have complained to Canon USA about the adapter quality and they must be aware of the lens hood issue.<br />They need to  tackle these issues.<br /><br />Postscript: Canon Service USA replied within 8 hours over the weekend to an e-mail complaining about the adapter, asking for a mailing address to send a replacement. However, more than 10 days later, there is still no sign of it, and they are refusing to deliver it to a UK address, having failed to deliver it in a timely manner to my US Vacation address - I hope someone in their Service Quality area is reading this. They need to sharpen up considerably...","First of all, I have had the camera about 10 months.<br /><br />I am an amateur photographer and have always used Canon cameras.  The camera before this was a Canon Rebel SLR and I loved it, but I wanted to see what I was shooting while I was shooting it.  (Nice to know at weddings you got the shot.) This is my first digital camera, and I am overall pleased.  The quality of the images is amazing.  I do notice the flash washing out images if I am taking candid shots.  The red eye is always there regardless of red-eye reduction.  I have yet to see a camera that actually reduces red-eye.  The feel of the camera is good to me.  The battery life is pretty good.  What I am not pleased with is having to take the battery out of the camera to charge.  I work full-time doing something other than photography and have a 1 year old to chase.  There have been times when I am getting everything together for a shoot in my home and the battery is dead. It takes an hour to charge completely (although 5 minutes will get you through the shoot.)  Also - the battery light flashes when you have about 2 minutes of life left.  There's no \"halfway gone\" or anything in between.  It shows either full or dead.<br /><br />Other things I have liked are the tripod mount being close to center of the lens, the software that downloads your pictures is awesome, the flip LCD screen, and the many different shooting modes (vivid, sepia, b&w, etc.)  This camera has been well worth the money, and bottom line is the quality of the picture, which has been fantastic.","I was not happy with the autofocus, but the firmware update I downloaded fixed the constant refocusing plus other things.  Everything else is great except maybe the Auto White Balance doesn't do too good where there is a mixture of light colors.  The manual setting and recalibration of \"white\" handles those situations.  Also I use a 1GB fast memory card and it seems to get sluggish when storing images after I have a hundred or so images on it; I think this is the file management.<br /><br />One big bummer: when recording videos, you cannot change zoom after you start the recording.","I bought this camera and it is everything I was looking for in a camera. I don't think anyone will be sorry for buying this camera. I also own a Canon G5 (5 Meg) and there is a remarkable difference in quality between the two. Excellent product for the money.","I have read all the reviews on this camera and after getting this I would have to say that most of the reviews are wrong about certain aspects of this camera. First off the autofocus lag has improved significantly since the new firmware was installed. While it is still not the fastest it is still very good for most shooting conditions.<br /><br />Most reviews rated its battery life as a disappointment. With the new firmware the battery life is great. I got this camera back in June and I have only had to recharge it 3 times. I have filled my 512mb card about 5-6 times in the period and I use the screen and flash on about 75% of shots.<br /><br />The USM zoom works better too. It is very responsive, and at first I thought that I might not like having a ring zoom but I like it now because it allows you to steady the camera with another hand and it lets you be more precise with zoom.<br /><br />Overall I really like this camera, I tried out the Sony V3, the G7 and the Pro 1. In the end all of these cameras are great but this one had a good feel to it and a lot of great features. I would highly suggest this camera, not to mention the great price.","I bought this camera at its highest price when it first came out(around $1200.00 USD) and booooooooooooy let me tell you... I am happy with the \"STILL\" shots that I took with it BUT totally UPHAPPY with the speed of the shutter!!!!!!!!! If you are looking for this camera to take any type of action shots... wildlife....sports...any type of movement... FORGET IT!  As one Review puts it:  \"...autofocus too slow for wildlife or sports...\"  That is exactly what I mean too!<br /><br />Perhaps I am missing something with this camera????  Someone tell me now! ??  Okay, I am being sarcastic here, but, it was a huge disappointment for me when I took this camera on vacation (when I have a few others that works just as well or perhaps better),and decided to take some fun shots of the fireworks and late night shots.... DANG, I was so angry! The view-finder detects NADA at night and when you think you are going to get that perfect shot.... it takes the shot seconds later!!! Most of the time I ended up with a black picture or a picture with the top of someones head in motion!<br /><br />I used to love this camera until now... My rating went down from a 5 to a 3....","NOTE: My Pro1 has the updated firmware which stops the screen freezing in continuous mode and from what I read below, improves focussing in low light dramatically. Some of the reviews here are probably for pre-update cameras. I think anyone used to a typical point-and-shoot will be impressed by the alacrity of the Pro1's focussing.<br /><br />Like many people, my first couple of digital cameras piqued my interest in photography. But because they were fully automatic, there were times when I couldn't take the shot I wanted.<br />BETTER THAN AN SLR?<br />I fancied a digital SLR to get the flexibility I wanted, but bought the Pro1 instead in the end. Why? Mainly because I wanted a variable-angle LCD screen so I could frame shots in awkward places.<br />DISPLAYS:<br />The 2-inch vari-angle LCD monitor is very good in bright light, and at 235,000 pixels, probably the highest resolution LCD available on a camera. You notice the extra resolution. The viewing angle is more critical than I would like though, made slightly worse because it snaps into certain preset positions which make tiny adjustments impossible at certain angles. I like the electronic viewfinder, which shows all the menu items and settings, shutter speed etc. and has dioptre adjustment. I wear glasses and there's no problem. It's the same resolution as the main LCD and almost always good enough.<br />There's also a top mounted LCD that's nicely illuminated in orange and shows all the camera settings.<br />BATTERY:<br />You might think that the battery life would suffer on a camera with three LCDs, a myriad of blinking LEDs, a heavy lens with continuous focus and a long zoom... but I've found the battery life excellent. You can turn off continuous focus to make the power last a bit longer, but then the screen freezes while focussing.<br />LENS:<br />I suppose the outstanding feature of the Pro 1 is the lens. At 28-200mm equivalent, this is a very flexible zoom. And because the widest aperture at full telephoto is still f3.5, it's pretty usable handheld if the light's good.<br />An unusual feature is that you turn the ring on the lens barrel to zoom, or to focus in manual mode. I quite like this, but to me, it turns the wrong way, and I still haven't got the hang of it! That may just be me though.<br />There is noticeable purple fringing at wide apertures, but overall, this is a splendid lens.<br />SPEED:<br />Not as responsive as an SLR, but pleasingly crisp in action. Low light focussing is the best I've experienced on a digital camera. At the wide angle end, it seems to be able to focus in near darkness with no trouble. Manual focus gives you an enlarged central area on the display and a distance reading. But I found it still wasn't easy to tell if the focus was right. But the camera can sharpen up your manual focus attempt, which is useful.<br />FEATURES:<br />As you'd expect from a camera at this level, it is bristling with features. I won't mention them all. The only one I would've liked that it doesn't have is a live histogram display. Movies are at 640 x 480 but sadly only 15fps and you can't zoom. You get a remote control.<br />ERGONOMICS:<br />Very important on a camera like this. The best bit is the jog wheel right next to the shutter release. It's perfectly placed and you can change shutter speed, aperture etc. You can also use it to scroll during playback. Most often used functions are on their own button, so you very rarely need to go into the menu system. It's very convenient to get back to record mode from playback mode: you just half press the shutter - great. I find I need two fingers to turn the mode dial. You can change the battery and CF card while it's on a tripod.<br />ANNOYANCES:<br />Very few. A non-tethered lens cap that I've resigned myself to losing one day, a strap that always seems to be in the way of the swivelling screen, a manual focus button that's too easy to press by mistake and a screen that freezes momentarily while the camera focuses, unless you're in continuous focus mode. Super Macro mode forces the camera into 4MP mode, though the results are still outstanding.<br />I've heard of quality-control issues with this camera. Indeed, I had to return my first example straightaway because of a CCD fault. I'm totally happy now, but I'd advise you to check yours very carefully when you get it.<br />CONCLUSION:<br />This is a very well built camera that's satisfyingly simple to use, feels good in the hand, and most importantly, has a great lens. The photos I've taken so far have impressed me enormously: they're sharp, with great colour, great subtlety and naturalness. With 8MP, you have all the flexibility you need to enlarge and crop. And with a feature set like this, and the option to add conversion lenses and filters, it's a camera you can grow into if you're moving up like I did.","This is a fantastic camera that takes excellent pictures! I highly recommend it, with one caveat: the auto-focus is *really* slow. (Much slower than Canon point-and-shoot digicams, and much slower than Canon 35mm film SLRs.)","SUMMARY:<br /><br />+Great lens<br /><br />+Fast<br /><br />-Poor sensor<br /><br />-8MP<br /><br />-USB 1<br /><br />-ISO Noise<br /><br />-Dizzying Evt<br /><br />-4:3 aspect ratio<br /><br />-fixed 8MP, 4MP only<br /><br />PREFACE: I've had great expectations from this camera, the best non-d-slr camera, top of the line Canon.  I am not a professional photographer and my previous camera is a 3MP Sharp VE-CG30U (Canon G1 based, same lense, updated body, but no swivel lcd - very good entry level camera).<br /><br />PROS: I love this Canon lens. Excellent range, wide angle, telephoto.  It has a pretty wide diameter and a shallow focal pane - allowing for excellent pictures with small dept of field (blurry background).  The zoom ring is an excellent solution.  The camera's operation is very impresive, pretty fast power on, focus and save (on CF) times.<br /><br />CONS: The CCD sensor caused lots of trouble for me - has to return my first two, I had bad light spots on the ccd on low shutter speeds (and sometimes visible at 1/60 flash shots).  My Nikon 5400 (similar Sony CCD) also had to be replaced for this.<br /><br />8MP is an overkill, I knew that upfront, but I considered it as an additional zoom - you can crop half of the image and still have enough resolution to print 8x10 !  What I did not realize, is that it creates an overhead of storing larger image files.  plus my 2GHZ P4 machine struggles with the 3MB files just when I try to browse through the directory.  The camera is equipped with a USB 1 (!!!) collection, so expect to wait quite a bit to download your pics (a card reader is mandatory).  After examining the pictures, I don't think that you can print a great shot, if you crop the most center of the image - you are much better off getting closer and reframing.  While the camera produces great pictures with a lot of detail, I don't see much advantage of this high resolution.<br /><br />In addition, the ISO setting on the pro1 is a joke - cannot use anything over 100 !  My cheapo old digital camera did not have as much noise on ISO 400 !  Why did they include ISO 200/400 with this much noise ?  It is unfair marketing.<br /><br />I get dizzy from the evf - it is a great idea, but a nightmare using - flashes and freezes while focusing - even after the latest firmware, unless you use the battery-draining continous focus operation.<br /><br />Note to Canon: I believe all the above problems are related to the Sony produced CCD.  This camera would give equally great pictures with a 5MP sensor - maybe then you could use higher ISO's.<br /><br />Software: While the label suggest professionalism, the camera does not have more settings/customizations than the S1 IS (which also has advanced-mechanical Image Stabiization full 30fp VGA video) !  I was especially diappointed the limited choise of picture size settings.  8MP or 4MP or 2MP or VGA !  All 4:3 modes !  When you print 4x6, all your pics will be cropped at the center.  My old Sharp had 3:2 aspect ratio - just like film, it is very good.  Then your full frame (as you pictured it) fits on 4x6 paper !  The Nikon 5400 also has a 3:2 mode - on the lcd it has a blank band on the top and bottom - great solution.  Canon EOS Digitals have a 3:2 sensor.  I cannot believe Canon could not include a similar option !","This is by far the best sub-SLR digital camera out there in my opinion, but it still isn't perfect.  The image quality beats the pants off of what any of my previous Sony's could do.  The color accuracy is much better, and overall exposure is much more balanced.  However, the Pro 1 suffers from grainyness in all images - even ones taken in bright sunlight.  Shadowed areas look pretty awful when you zoom in on them.  But, since we're talking 8+ megapixels, that grain is usually not noticable at all at viewing sizes.  It's only when you zoom in that you can see a large amount of grain, but even bright blue skies look like sandpaper when you start to zoom in.<br /><br />The only other problem I can report is an apparent dead-pixel problem with their CCD's.  I bought my Pro 1 and a few days later I noticed that all of my shots had a spattering of red pixels in areas of the images.  Ends up there were quite a few 5+ dead pixels on the CCD, so I returned it to the store and exchanged it for another one.  Two weeks later I noticed a single (but very large) dead pixel on the CCD.  I haven't dealt with that yet since I need the camera right now, but if that dead pixel continues to bug me I'll probably complain.  So, since I got two separate Pro 1's and *both* had bad pixels on the CCD, I'd encourage you to test your Pro 1 as soon as you get it and look for bad  pixels.","Santa brought me this camera for Christmas and he must have liked how I behaved the past year, because this camera is an utter delight.  Other reviewers went to great lengths to describe the strengths and weaknesses of the Canon Pro1.  For the most part, they are right, especially regarding some of the slightly odd ergonomics.  (I tend to wrap my right thumb around - and activate - a couple of buttons.)  Chalk it up to old habits and unfamiliarity.  Chalk it up to electronic gadgetry.<br /><br />Basically, in my opinion:<br /><br />* photos come out unbelievably sharp, in some very adverse conditions<br /><br />* the camera's macro capabilities are outstanding, with exceptional results<br /><br />* the flash works quite well within a twenty foot range; tacking on my Speedlite from my old T90 solves more challenging situations<br /><br />* altering aperture and shutter settings, along with the numerous other camera settings, allows for some nice creativity and flexibility<br /><br />* Canon's PC software and connecting cable works great<br /><br />* It focuses rapidly and triggers quickly<br /><br />* Auto-bracketing and exposure compensation work wonderfully<br /><br />* With my 2 gig Hitachi microdrive, I can take loads of fairly decent quality video with audio.  Amazing.<br /><br />I frankly do not see how you can go wrong with this camera.  It's not too large and the construction is top-notch.  Buy with confidence.","I spent weeks comparing cameras in this class and was even \"convinced\" by my local Wolf Camera manager that I needed a Digital SLR.  This camera is extremely versitile; ranging from a point & shoot to completely adjustable settings.  No interchangable lenses?  Never really used them on my old SLR, anyway.  One important note for those of you considering a digital SLR: you can only use viewfinder (not the display) when taking photos.  Display can only be used to review the photo after it has been shot.  Maybe not a big issue for some, but once you've become used to this feature with digital cameras, it will be hard to go back exclusively to a viewfinder.","Ok, this isn't one of my usual hands-on reviews.  I ain't got the kind of money to buy all these cameras and test them.  But I wanted to give potential buyers some help...<br /><br />Should you consider an SLR-type EVF (electronic viewfinder) digital camera or an interchangeable-lens digital SLR for serious photography?  I faced this question and agonized over it for months.  I wish I had come across this brief and very helpful article by Popular Photography Magazine (I'm not affiliated with them in any way):<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The article compares five current-model EVF cameras: Canon PowerShot Pro 1, Konica-Minolta Dimage A2, Nikon Coolpix 8700, Olympus Camedia C-8080, and Sony Cybershot DSC-F828.  It's a very easy read, and at the end the writers give you a helpful checklist for the EVF vs. d-SLR decision.<br /><br />As for myself, I'm going with a d-SLR since I want 1) high-quality lens, 2) lens choices, 3) little to no shutter lag, and 4) accessory choices.  Good luck!","The built-in flash of Pro 1 is very weak.  I use this camera mostly indoor now because we just had a baby.  Almost every time the pictures have dark corners (not my shadow, BTW).  Last week we brought some relatives to Luray Cavern in Virginia, the flash illustrated the people ok but not the stone columns behind.  The built-in flash on my brother's old 3.2 mp Olympus did the much, much better job.  Finally I decided to buy a external flash ($100+).  Now the problem is solved.","I'm very picky about the detail of the camera so this review becomes very long, sorry about that in the first place.<br /><br />At the first I ordered Nikon Coolpix 8700 because of the price (at that time there was a rebate of $200). However, when I had the Nikon in my hand it feels not comfortable because on the right hand side, there's a pin sticking out for the shoulder strap, and on the left side you have to be careful not to touch the control panel when you place on your hand. So I ordered Canon Powershot Pro1 to compare whether I should spend about $200 more or not, and the answer was ABSOLUTELY!!!!  These are a few reasons I choose Canon over Nikon. since all of the technical issue such as the quality of the picture, and all other technical stuff are already answered by other people, I will just talk about something detail or you might call it picky. Some people might find this is weird.<br /><br />The 2\" LCD of Canon and brighter and sharper than Nikon 1.8\", I can clearly see the different between the two. However, on the EVF, I think Nikon did the better job on that one. It's not the big different like they have on the LCD, just noticeable.<br /><br />Another option that I like about canon is it got the focus beep and the square in the EVF turn green when the camera got the focus, Nikon doesn't have this option, but it just shows in the screen with the green dot when it got the focus.<br /><br />The manual focus in Canon is way better than Nikon because when you're using canon your right hand thumb is holding the MF button and your left hand is turning the focus ring. This make canon feel like a real SLR.<br /><br />On the charger, I think I like canon charger better than Nikon's because canon charger tells you how far the battery has been charging 1 blink for empty, 2 blinks for 50%, 3 blinks for 75% and become solid when it fully charged.<br /><br />Don't waste money on buying a flash shoe because I will disable the internal flash automatically. I did that when I first got the camera because I thought I would help protect it from dust and etc.<br /><br />You get extra accessories with canon such as remote control, lens hood, and 64MB high speed CF (but no one worry about this one).<br /><br />On the USB issue, both Nikon and Canon got USB1.1 unlike Sony F828. But I just order the firewire CF reader from amazon it's called Delkin Devices READER-24 FireWire Reader and Writer for CompactFlash (...) It transfer my 512mb very fast. I would recommend it over any USB 2.0 reader because they're usually failed.<br /><br />I think overall Canon look more professional than Nikon Coolpix 8700. Moreover, Nikon 8700 and 5700 are identical except the red and grey rubber grip, so some people might think Coolpix 8700 is 5700 which mean people might think that you have 5700 instead of 8700. But if you're carrying Canon Powershot pro 1, for some people, they might know for sure that it's the top of the line digital camera for Canon.<br /><br />For the response on the other member on the small flakes that he has on his camera's lens, I checked out my camera for the flake as soon as I got my camera from amazon.com and found no flake. However, after camera going through after zoom cycle like Tim said, now there's some flakes appear in the lens. I was worried about it quite a bit, but like Tim said the flakes do not affect the quality of the pictures. By the way, I first use this camera when I had my vacation, so the camera went through a lot of zoom cycle and on/off operation. Now there's interesting thing happened, I always checked for the flakes in the lens, but about 2nd day after I first found out about the flakes, all the flakes are gone now!!! I don't know how this happened, but assume the following actions might be the reason:<br /><br />„X I did tap the side of the lens after I found out the flakes, hoping it might fall out to the side of the lens, but I was not.<br />„X The way I placed my camera in the camera bag was a bit awkward. I have case logic bag which is a quite bigger than the camera, I place the camera when it's not being use by having the left side of the camera(from the EVF view) on the bottom of the bag, which made the right side of the camera(the battery compartment) facing up ward. I didn't mean to place the camera in this position but I just thought which position would be convenient for me to have the camera store in the bag, so that it would be easier to take it out from the bag with my right hand.<br /><br />Hope this is helping clearing out some question about the flakes.","I am by no means an expert photographer, but I know a little bit about ISO and aperatures and such.<br /><br />Like the previous reviewer, I greatly anticipated receiving my Powershot Pro1 from Amazon. You can read many professional reviews on this camera so I will keep this short.<br /><br />I thought I should mention that, exactly like another reviewer, my camera had DEBRIS inside the lens housing. Plus the lens appeared scratched or perhaps had some kind of coating flaw. I was extremely happy with Amazon's return/exchange procedure, could not have been easier. Well, I got my new camera and it looked OK, but after several zoom cycles, I noticed it too had some white flaky debris inside the lens. I carefully examined a photo taken afterward and believe it is not affecting the image quality, but I do not understand how an $850+ camera should have this kind of quality problem. There are only 1-2 small flakes visible, so for now I will keep the camera.<br /><br />Other notes: Close-up image quality is stunning. Highly lit environments are a little washed out in auto mode, so you may find you are running the camera more in manual modes to improve image quality. Movie mode is a great feature.","I upgraded from a G3, an excellent camera, and looked carefully at the other 8Mpix cameras before choosing the Pro1.<br /><br />The Pro1 has, for me, the best overall quality, versatility and ease of use of all the 8Mpix offerings. I have not found any trouble with the \"lack\" of an autofocus light due to the hybrid system, though focusing at long zoom lengths is troublesome in nearly all cameras.<br /><br />Flash performance is fantastic, and the Pro1 has ETTL and zoom support with affordable Canon external flashes. The Nikon and Sony can't do this and the Olympus flash is horrendously expensive. I've found that adding an external flash to bounce the light has made a dramatic improvement in my indoor photography, so Canon's external flash support makes a huge difference.","As a botanist/ecologist/photographer I do a great deal of plant photography. I have used Canon products for years and swear by them and rarely at them. The Pro1, though, leaves a lot to be desired for my purposes. The EOS 10D does far better even with lower resolution. The Pro1, for the purposes I need, is not very suitable. (See my review of the PowerShot S1 IS).<br />  But as a photgrapher who has been published around the world, mostly medium and large format photographs, I think for most people the Pro1 would be a very good choice. It has excellent construction and the image quality is superb with very true color, much better than most. If you don't want to mess with RAW image processing, you can photograph using the Super high resolution Large (gives you a JPG image) and get excellent results that compare very favorably with RAW processing and none of the fiddling with RAW. The availability of a 28mm equivalent wide angle is also very nice and not all that common.<br />  The sharpest aperature to use is f5.6 or f6.3. The images are just a hair softer at larger or smaller apertures. Even the digital zoom will produce a pretty decent image at 14x, but gets worse at maximum digital zoom. Usually digital zoom is pretty worthless, but when you start with 8 megapixels you can still end up with a suitable pixel count after all the digital footwork that goes on in the camera. But generally you are still further ahead shooting at maximum optical zoom (no digital) and cropping, if you don't mind some additional digital manipulation antics to improve things.<br />  So, all in all, I highly recommend this camera to anyone who needs high resolution and compact size. It is a good buy. But for really good macro photography I recommend a digital SLR and a top notch macro lens. If you only do a little macro work and are not real fussy about having razor sharp images then this camera will do fine. Sometimes it would almost match the 10D, but not quite. For all other uses, the camera is great.","This is my 3rd Canon Digital camera - Powershot G2 and G3 were the previous ones. Took 20,000 pics with them.<br />Things I love about the Powershot Pro1:<br />-takes excellent macro (close-up) photos. The clarity is incredible, especially when using the \"Super Macro\" mode.<br />-Color is exccellent.<br />-Moveable LCD panel on back. I take mostly nature shots - closeups. This allows me to take photos from positions I could never get into without the moveable panel. Shoot from under flowers, raise the camera up to shoot down onto flowers that are above my head, etc.<br />-battery life is superb - about 400-600 or more photos per charge.<br />-the 7x zoom is awesome. From 30 feet I can take a photo of a 2\" diameter flower and see the details of the flower in the resulting pic.<br />-Many advanced features. READ THE MANUAL! You won't discover this camera's full potential until you do.<br />Drawbacks:<br />-The first Pro1 I got had dust and fibers INSIDE the lens. I was able to trade it for another one 2 weeks later after I discovered the flaw - the dust and fibers were only visible when examining the lens in sunlight. One of the replacement camera they were going to give me also had dust inside the lens.<br />-This second unit I had became defective after 2 weeks. The zoom lens started moving in and out with jerks - sticking. So now I am on my 3rd Pro1 unit. Hopefully the problems with the prior ones are not typical!!<br />-Slow focussing and composition, as mentioned in other reviews. Not as much of a problem for me, as I do mostly plant photos. But it has caused me to miss butterfly shots.<br />-The lens cap is a pain to put on and remove. A simple push-on one would've been MUCH better. And I am wondering if the necessary action of squeezing the two little tabs all the time caused the failure of my 2nd unit (lens movement sticking - this action may be always pushing the lens from side to side, and cause the mechanism to wear prematurely?<br />-Have to watch exposures. I find my photos are often overexposed. I have learned the conditions under which this happens, and have learned to compensate for it (which is easy to do). But this was an issue with the G2 & G3 also.<br />-Regular macro mode is poor at auto-focussing. However, the \"Super-Macro\" mode is VERY good at auto-focussing.<br />So far, I HIGHLY recommend this camera. I have taken 4000 pics with it in the 40 days I have had a Pro1, and I like it a lot.<br />It has very advanced features, and even has more features than the Rebel. For example, you can select center-spot metering - can't do that on the Rebel except in Manual mode (if I recall correctly). It is \"pseudo-SLR\" in that the vewfinder displays the same info as the LCD panel. The zoom is excellent, although some people don't like the \"zoom-by-wire\" aspect of it.","Having never owned a high-end camera I was a little intimidated by the various offerings on the market.  I wanted a camera that I could use as a point and shoot and would also allow me to become a bit more \"creative\" with my photography.  I started my research from scratch and had no preference regarding manufacturers, mega pixels, lenses, etc.  I read every professional review and consumer review that I could find.  I finally narrowed my selection down to two models.  The Konica Minolta Dimage A2 and the Canon PowerShot Pro 1.<br />I made a point of visiting my local camera shop so I could get a hands on look at the various options, feel and performance of each camera.  The salesman was a Minolta aficionado and tried steering me towards the A2 by quoting a multitude of statistics (many of which were erroneous or existed on both cameras). After holding the PowerShot and playing with it a while, I selected the Canon as my future camera and set about purchasing one.<br />I must say that I'm ecstatic with my decision.  The camera weight and size is perfect as is the performance.  During my research I came across two items which I have verified as areas of concern:  1) The camera has difficulty focusing in low light.  This often includes indoor environments with 60w - 100w lighting nearby.  I have overcome this by reading up on photographic techniques and how to manipulate a camera to obtain the shot I'm looking for.  Took me a while to conquer something more than the Auto setting, but I'm doing it now and the low-light focus is no longer a problem.  2) Shutter lag seems long.  In Auto mode, this is a definite problem if you're shooting any kind of action.  Once again, photographic techniques have all but eliminated the shutter lag.  Using the custom settings I have reduced the shutter lag to a point that it's no longer an issue.  I simply make the camera do what I want rather that giving it complete control.<br />Over all, the PowerShot Pro 1 is superb.  It's size, weight and performance are excellent and the options available are surprising.  If you're looking for a camera that will do it all for you, beware of this one due to the low-light focus issue and shutter lag.  If you're willing to take control of the camera, I highly recommend it!","If you attached the filter adapter to the lens, and take a picture set to 28mm with the flash, there would be a darkened area size of half a quarter at the mid lower edge of the picture.  The adapter gets in the way of the flash at 28mm.<br />This is poor design for an expensive camera like the Pro1.","The CD supplied with said camera didn't install in a computer which has the required software and hardware.<br />The AC adapter didn't work with a notebook computer which has the required hardware and software","The Powershot Pro1 is the best all-around 8 megapixel digicam. It is compact (unlike the Olympus 8080, Sony F828, and Konica Minolta A2); has a fast 28-200 lens (Olympus only goes to 140mm equivalent, Nikon doesn't allow wide angle); and allows for fine adjustment of focal length (Olympus and Nikon use a crude zoom lever that makes it difficult to zoom exactly as you want to). An additional important point is that the Powershot can actually be used in RAW mode: the Olympus, Sony, and Nikon cameras lock-up for a while after taking a picture in RAW mode (this means the camera is not usable for up to 12 seconds after a RAW picture is taken).<br />Perhaps the closest competitor to the Powershot Pro1 is the Konica Minolta A2, but the A2 has an old lens design that lacks the resolution of the Powershot Pro1, and the A2 is much bigger, lacks the high resolution LCD screen on the Pro1, and has limited movement of its LCD screen. The A2 has a very high resolution viewfinder, but with a good LCD screen (like the Pro1), using a viewfinder is not preferable (for me at least). The A2 also has been noted in online reviews to have quality control problems.<br />Comparisons aside, some reviewers here have suggested that the Pro1 has \"slow\" autofocus and that the LCD screen freezes for a moment as the autofocus operates. The conclusion given is that the Pro1 is therefore difficult to use with moving subjects. The difficulty, however, is primarily with photographic technique rather than the camera's autofocus system. Because of the sensor size and lens design, the Pro1 has a large depth of field, meaning that subjects will appear in focus over a fairly large distance. Even at the telephoto end, the depth of field for a portrait (e.g. 100mm) at f/4.5 will be sufficient that you can pre-focus the lens and follow a moving subject easily. The shutter response is very very fast when the lens is already at its focus point. This is a standard technique often overlooked by people who never used a manual focus camera. And this technique is far better than relying on the autofocus system in any of the 8 megapixel cameras: none of them is faster than intelligent pre-focusing! The Pro1 makes this even easier by allowing the user to store a focus distance in the Custom1 and Custom2 settings.<br />This is a terrific camera. No camera is perfect, but the Pro1 makes the best compromises in its class.<br />And for those worried about image noise when looking at photos magnified on screen: this is eliminated from actual prints using any of several noise reduction software packages. Don't be afraid to use 400 speed on the Pro1, put the file through good noise reduction software, and print it. The result will still be very nice.","The PowerShot Pro1 is a camera designed to be familiar to current Canon owners, easy enough to use for first time buyers and yet still provide a semiprofessional feel and feature set. Canon has borrowed from its professional lens line to put an L quality label on the lens system to indicate that this is a new lens and it has been designed to fulfill the high resolution requirements of an eight megapixel CCD. In use the Canon felt slightly slower than I was expecting, certainly not much faster than the G5 and I didn't see any marked improvement in speed overall from that camera.<br />Overall image quality was good, that L lens proving it can deliver the resolution and that Canon's reliable DiGiC image processor can turn out a quality image with good tonal and color balance and no noticeable artifacts.<br />[...]","I have had atleast 6 film slr's over the past 20 plus years, and when digital came out over 5 years ago, I waited for the right time to buy. The advantages of a digital over a film camera are obvious, but the resolution and lack of wide angle below $1000 was the main limitation. Now those are no longer as much an issue unless I was shooting something for a large poster.<br />Reasons I chose this camera at this time:<br />1. I pondered the Digital rebel because of the 17 odd EOS lenses I have, starting at the 20 MM wide. I find the wide angle most useful for scenery and indoors, the medium tele for people pics. The 1.6 lens multiplier for semi-pro DSLRs made all my wides except the 20 mm useless. That killed the Rebel idea.<br />2. I find 28 mm my MOST used wide angle since it captures scenery in a way I want to remember it. The 20 is great indoors, but for scenery, it really makes the background too small. This camera has 28 mm.<br />3. I find the 85 to 200 mm range great for people portraits, 85 being best. This has that range.<br />4. I didn't want to end up cleaning dust from my CCD with interchangeable lenses, especially on a camera I want to use a lot. That killed the rebel idea again.<br />5. The L lens really shines, with great colors and resolution. Look a [...] and see for yourself. The color is definitely cleaner and the resolution fantastic.<br />6. For wideangle, the stitch mode really kicks (...). There is nothing as good as Canon's implementation of this concept.<br />7. With digital at 8MP, I can get a better picture into the computer than the best 35 mm slide film and home slide-scanning. Less artifacts, noise and NO DUST!<br />8. Once you get a high quality digital picture into the computer, the possibilities are endless. You can't add resolution in a computer, you need to start with it. You can do things with masks etc. to show highlight and shadow detail like no film could ever do, just not enough exposure latitude.<br />9. At 50 ASA, this camera blows the competition away, in ALL respects. Hence for the best digital shot below $1000, this is the camera.<br />10. Built like a tank, is compatible with all of Canons newer gadgetry, takes filters, polarizers (yes!) had built in ND filter, what more could you ask for under $1000.<br />11. I love the controls. Took a couple of hours reading through the manual and familiarizing myself with the camera.<br />12. Turn OFF the the continuous focus if you are not going to need it, esp. for things that are not moving, focusses beautifully.<br />13. The 2\" 235K pixel CCD in the back is the best Ive seen, probably the same from the 4.5K$ new Canon Pro D1 MkII camera. Plus the 180 degree rotation is priceless. I use it when I do self timer shots with groups, macro etc.etc.<br /><14> Camera does focus bracketing, which I never had on my EOS Elans and isn't available on probably any DSLR. Manual focus is available just in case. <15> I checked moire and noise in Photoshop, none to minimal. Photos need no equalization and noise removal. A little moire removal on things like reflections on hair  (only sometimes).<br /><16> The only thing I might add are..live histogram, but most time I know whats going to be overexposed, the camera only confirms it. Exposure latitude  is wider than film.<17> The Depth of Field, the space in which everything is in focus, is much much greater than in a 35MM film camera. Hence f-stops over F8 that I used with my wide angles is unnecessary. At 28mm, I get depth of field from 9\" to infinity on the Pro 1 whereas I needed F22 on my 35mm camera. This had held me back from buying digital until I dicovered this fact doing some research.","This is the fifth digital camera I have owned...I've had 12 35mm cameras before this. Without a doubt this is the best of the lot! I have taken 5,000 pictures and movies with it alreadyand have learned that you must be patient initially to see just what this incredible Canon product can do. All the criticisms of it are from people who seem to think you should use the automatic settings for all the extreme types of photos. This is not the case. Just like any pro type camera, there are times when you should crack the manual and try all the myriad of settings. Believe me you will not be sorry if you do just that.","I own the Digital Rebel (300D) and last week I bought this Pro1 for my wife. So after a week of intensive use and testing (we are both professionnal wedding photographers) here are the pros and cons, some of them compared to the rebel:<br />PROS:<br />- 8 MP<br />- L \"pro\" lens, really delivers crisper and sharper images than the bundled EF-S of my rebel, but I still prefer my EF 50mm f/1.4 USM<br />- 28-200mm equivalent is everything we could ask for weddings, we usually stay in the 28-80 range anyway because of flash range limitations<br />- the built-in flash is reliable, fast and strong<br />- lots of functions and modes, + 2 custom settings<br />- very small, *ideal* for a woman's hands, yet again I'm used to the rebel plus the battery grip so...<br />- 1 compartment for CF card and battery<br />- incredibly bright, big and clear LCD, very useful<br />- flip over LCD panel<br />- good battery bundled (1350 mAh versus 1100 for the rebel)<br />- also bundled: 64MB CF, neck strap, 58mm filter adapter, remote control (!) and hood<br />- Good price (same as rebel)<br />- hot shoe for external flash<br />- black \"pro\" look<br />CONS:<br />- Electronic zoom ring, a bit slow and drains battery<br />- autofocus too slow for wildlife or sports<br />- not as user friendly as previous Canon models<br />- maybe a tad too small for most men hands<br />- smaller cmos sensor than the digirebel<br />- takes like 2 seconds to turn on (I expected less than the rebel, but it's the same)<br />- usb 1.1 (should be 2.0 what the Hell was Canon thinking??)<br />- almost impossible to focus in low light, even with an external flash with IF assistant beam<br />- freezes the viewfinder for a sec when if focuses, annoying<br />- not many additionnal accessories (like battery pack, eyepiece extender...)<br />Bottom Line: I would still recommend it for weddings or maybe all-round, but the next thing I'm buying in about 6 months will definitely be another digital SLR (like the 1Ds), give the rebel to my wife and sell the pro1. It's a great camera, but it's not really \"pro\" like the name and the L lens suggests.<br />Well that's about it, I hope it helps.","Before I purchased the Powershot Pro I had owned both the Canon S40 and the S50, I was happy to find that Canon had continued the same software format and that having experience with the former allowed me to use the Powershot Pro immediately.  First a complaint:  Yo Cannon whatsup with the lens cap!?  After seventy-five years of cameras designed with a lens housing longer than the lens such that one can palm a cap on it without looking, or more importantly remove it without looking, Canon reinvents the wheel, and badly.  The lens housing does not protrude farther than the lens, everything from fingers to clothes to branches touch the lens because it has none of the typical protection.  The cap fits in one position only, locking in with tabs that must be pressed on both sides to remove it.  Simply unusable and probably left off by most users, which means a chronically dirty lens.  The second problem is the long period of time that it takes to calculate an image,  over a second in the best conditions and longer in poor light.  This is a complete nuisance and a reason to shop for another camera if you take motion shots.  There is no such thing with this camera, the subject is off frame by the time it reads the light, etc.  A poor job in this area.<br />Those complaints out the way I find the camera useful, the movie mode records in 640 X 480 making it useful for something other than a novelty as it was on the earlier Powershot line.  The lens is excellent, in the Supermacro mode it focuses at one half inch and with the 7X optical zoom added onto the 15X digital zoom it is possible to shoot either a frame-filling shot of a finger nail as well as the numbers on an airplane flying at 3,000 feet, and with the same lens!  It is an L series lens and focuses by sound, somehow, so it is always busy readjusting as one moves the camera, also the viewfinder is through the lens making it technically a SLR. The software allows one to use different areas of the LCD to focus so there is no reason not to get the perfect focus every time.  The combination of light metering, shutter speed, F stops, and focal variation are so great one could shoot each shot dozens of ways, and probably will.  Get a big compactflash card for this one.  The battery lasts so long at this writing I can't say how long because I have yet to deplete it; with the S40 or S50 one always carried a spare because they lasted about an hour, not with the Powershot Pro, seems like many hours, at least three so far, stay tuned.<br />The photographs in general are excellent,  as long as the subject is still and it has its second or two to calculate.","I'm an amateur and all I can say about this camera is that \"I love it\", couldn't ask for a better piece of equipment. Intuitive and easy to operate.  I bought filters and love the results of my images even more.  True high noise at ISO 200/400, tough to get quick response on the action shots, but that's about it, this camera delivers alot of performance and quality photos. Worth every penny paid! I'm glad I waited for this one!","I recently purchased a PRO1 after trying a Minolta A2, which I liked a lot but in the end couldn't live with the soft images it took.  The Minolta A2 has rightly been praised for having great ergonomics so I was a little concerned as to whether I had been spoiled too much.  But actually I have been pleasantly surprised by the PRO1.  The buttons are in logical places and it is very quick and easy to shift between play and record modes. The EVF is much better than I thought it would be and seems just as good as the A2 (to my eye at least).  The zoom is also good -- again, I thought I would miss the manual zoom on the A2, but with a little practice the PRO1's zoom seems just as responsive.  There's even a way to get the zoom to rapidly move, a bit like the express option on a car window. I had also seen some criticism of start up time, but it seems fine to me (and faster than my old G2).  Similarly, some people seem irritated that the LCD/Viewfinder blacks out momentarily after taking a picture, but to me this seems OK and something I can easily live with (hardly even notice after a while).<br />Of course the camera is bit on the small side compared with the other 8MP offersings so that takes some getting used to and I could see the camera being a little cumbersome for larger hands.  But I like the fact that the camera is fairly diminutive and not too obvious.  There are a couple of annoyances -- the lens cap seems flimsy and cheap,  but as I intend to permanently mount a UV filter on the camera I'll be buying a 58mm lens cap anyway.  Unfortunately though it appears that the sun-shade cannot be mounted when the filter adapter is attached. The LCD is fantastic -- a little larger than previous Canon models.  The articulation also seems a bit stiffer than my G2 which is actually a good thing and is less prone to be accidentally moved (and subsequently misaligning a shot).<br />Probably the biggest thing to get used to is the AF.  Some have complained that it is slow, and I can see if you are taking action shots it could be.  I'm primarily going to be taking portraits & landscapes so it's fine for me and seems responsive enough, and more importantingly appears to be accurate.  The biggest challenge I've had with the AF is trying to get a lock in low light.  I eventually realized by perusing a few forums that the AF doesn't work well at focal lengths > 50mm in low light.  This is a shame and probably the main reason why I give this 4 stars instead of 5, but it is certainly not a showstopper.  I also found it a little difficult to use in macro mode (at least taking flowers) when it tends to hunt more than I would expect.<br />But the best thing about the camera is resolution -- it really delivers.  Pictures taken in 8MP are crisp and contain an amazing amount of detail.  I specifically wanted a camera with large resolution so I could take pictures of buildings or landscapes and crop. I can tell already that it's going to be possible to make a lot of prints with no or minimal post-processing.  Like a lot of people I don't want to spend hours after a vacation processing pictures in Photoshop so it's important to me to be able to print directly out of the camera.  The PRO1 seems very suited for this.<br />The one thing I do miss about the A2 is the anti-shake.  Also noise on the PRO1 is noticeable above ISO 100 so that means you'll need to shoot at ISO50 or 100.  I went out to my local park tonight and took some pictures about 15-30 mins before sunset and discovered that many of my pictures were blurred even with camera speeds at 1/80 or so.  As I shot with ISO 200 & 400 I also found the pictures just too noisy to be of much use without PPing them.  But that could just be me getting used to the camera, as I've certainly got very sharp pictures in brighter conditions, but if I have use a tripod more often it would probably be worth it.<br />As with everything there is no perfect product, but this camera, despite a few AF deficiencies and quirks, really comes closer to what I was hoping to find in an 8MP camera and most importantingly, creates large crisp and pleasing images.","I'm a fairly inexperienced camera user, and this is my second digital.  My previous camera was a Canon Powershot A80, which did everything exactly as expected, and is great for the money.<br />I waited excitedly for months to get my hands on this camera, and, as a whole, the camera is exceptional. Image quality is great.  It's also very responsive, and super easy to use (for a manual cam).  You just can't beat the swivel LCD screen, (super) macro mode, and 8mp resolution.<br />There are, however, some things which should be mentioned:<br />-High noise at ISO over 200 (camera does 50/100/200/400)<br />-Autofocus very sluggish, making it hard to catch action shots<br />-Made to hold with right hand, in which it fits nicely.  On the left side, however, there is no \"comfortable\" spot to hold the camera.  Not ergonomically correct.  Even bizarre.  I usually just \"rest\" it on my hand.<br />-No AF assist light for focusing in low light/night time situations.  This is truely bizarre, as my A80 ($300 camera) has one built in, and it works great!  Seems like a ridiculous oversight...<br />-Alot of buttons on a small camera.  Fingers may cramp.<br />By no means is the camera \"junk\", and I've enjoyed it thus far, but felt it necessary to mention these problems for others to consider.","This is my 5th digital and the best of the lot. I have been getting consistently sharp pictures with a huge amount of detail and correct color saturation from day 1.<br />I love the swivel LCD and found the camera to be easy to operate.<br />If all you are going to do is point and shoot this is the camera for you. If you like control of aperture, shutter speed, white light etc....., this is also the camera for you.<br />I like to keep the camera at super fine resolution and find the amount of detail this camera picks up astounding. Even if I crop out a tiny section of the image the resolution is excellent.<br />The battery life is very good. Most people will need a 512 MG or larger card though. Maybe an extra battery too.<br />What could make the camera better? Perhaps a lower price tag, and an inexpensive camera case. My poor camera sat around unprotected for 2 weeks! I know, not all camera come with a bag or case in their package, but it would have been nice.<br />Bottom line is the picture quality is one of the best of the 8 MGP digicams out there right now. The small size is a definate plus for me, and it starts up quickly and handles very well.<br />Not the best in lowlight situations, but for me the other advantages outnumber this one feature.","I believe this camera excels in everything.  It takes really great shots and you have the control to do many things.  Canon hit the ball hard with this camera.  One problem is the quick freeze before you take a shot, hard to shoot an action photo.","As expected, the image quality is excellent.  The drawback is the viewfinder.  This is through the lens, which would be fine but pressing the shutter release part way freezes the image for a moment before the camera fires.  I was trying to photograph my young niece jumping on a trampoline and running around and found it almost impossible because the frame would freeze as soon as I pressed half way down.  The apparent solution is to not press the shutter release until ready to fire, which will tend to produce jerkier images.  Perhaps practice will solve the problem but for now I think this camera will be difficult to use for any kind of action or motion shot.  For the price, this is a surprising flaw.<br />The shots that do work out are really impressive.  Rich, saturated colors, remarkably good exposure even with flash and a dark background.  Potential to be a pro point and shoot.","I looked at the Nikon 8700 and the Canon Pro 1.  I had them both in hand, shot pictures, compared the EVF, comfort, weight and read all the reviews prior to see the actual cameras.  After a long evaluation I decided on the Canon.  It just had a better feel.  The camera offers a lot of features.  I wanted to get back into a camera that would do something other that point and shoot, which this does very well.  I also wanted to be able to adjust the apature and film speed.  Creative and fun things.<br />The first pictures I took were very impressive. Low light visibility is good.  It has a SLR feel and sound to it. Color was beautiful and th 7X optical is just perfect to be hand held.<br />One important thing to consider is how the camera will operate in low light.  It has an AF assist, which should be on all cameral or it will not be able to focus on a particular subject and the picture will be blurred. Without getting technical, this camera can be used by a novice or a professional.  It's versality is unbelievable.  Also, a very important feature of this camera is its battery.  It has an extremely long life and its charger is small, easily carried in a case and charges to full charge in one hour.","This is a camera that I thought would be perfect. I was moving up from a G1 that had served well and was fault free. The eight megapixels sounded great, and I knew the camera would be intuitively easy to use. I had looked hard at the Digital Rebel, and liked the opportuity for a better lens. But I like being able to shoot using the LCD more. It is often more convenient and can help with some really difficult angles. The downside is that it is hard to maneuver. You have to grasp it from the right, and it is heavy on the left due the position of the lens. The style of the grip makes it hard to hold. Unlike the G1, there is no factory case. There's a bag, but not a case that you could have on the camera that might make it easier to grasp. For me, no regrets, just some compromise."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix A330","amazon_reviews":["Great service by Bob's Cameras","Useful","I found this camera in the bottom of a water-damaged box in the storage shed of a house I bought! It had a tiny 512MB card in it (I own 2 Olympus cameras, so I was happy about the xD card) While I can only shoot about 10 pics before it fills the card, the quality is better than expected for old technology and a camera that was, more than likely, abused to start with. You have to really play around with the settings to make sure you know what you're doing in various photo situations, but I'm still impressed. Let me reiterate: for 6 year old technology, it's probably better than the other cameras that were out there at the time.<br /><br />Obviously, I would not recommend buying this camera at full price now. If you can CL one or find one here used, go for it.

The lens stays protected when not in use, thanks to the sliding cover. It's lightweight and small enough to easily fit into my purse. The controls are easy to use (much easier than the controls of the previous Fuji camera I owned.) The quality of the pictures it takes is superb for \"only\" 3.1 megapixels. Colors are true (especially skin tones), focus is always excellent, details are superb and lifelike. Besides regular family photos, I also use this camera for selling small items on Ebay and, again, the quality is excellent. When the time comes for me to replace this camera, it will only be in order to have a movie-shoot function. Otherwise, this has been the best camera I've ever owned!","the level of satisfaction you will get with this camera totally depends on what you're looking for when you buy it. If you're looking for a good start-up camera this is the perfect choice. easy to operate, good quality pictures, and an outstanding price.<br /><br />i would definately recommend this camera to that crowd.<br /><br />but if you're more serious about photography and want consistant results from this camera, you won't find it here. about half of the pictures you take will be blurry and only about 10% will probably turn out the way you want.<br /><br />but i can't imagine why those people would buy such a cheap camera if they're that serious. that's why i give it 4 stars.","I own this camera for past 1 year. Its doing good - both at indoors and outdoors. The picture quality is decent with no grains. I usually prefer to take prints than sharing thru computer. The prints are nice in 4 x 6.<br /><br />The macro mode is not so great...but it works. The battery life is excellent. I've taken over 200+ pictures using rechargable batteries and still battery is alive.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Good picture quality for 4 X 6 prints. May be even for higher size. But I've not tried.<br /><br />2. Excellent Battery Life<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Date & Time is not imprinted in the image. Tried DPOF settings. Still not happy.","i have had good experiences and bad experiences with this camera.<br /><br />my sister got the same camera as me on the same day [christmas] and her's lasted about a month before malfunctioning. the flash is not timed correctly with the picture taking and all her pictures come out extremely dark or black. unfortunately we had thrown out the box, and having heard about fujifilms's bad reputation with customers, we did not do anything about it.<br /><br />however, my experiences with this camera have been extremely good! this camera is seemingly very durable [i've definitely dropped it a few times] and takes great pictures. i have not had any problems. the recovery time between shots is a little lagging, but other than that, i have no complaints. my pictures all come out great and the battery life is ok [not the best-but i've had worse]. i've had it about a year though, and it's still taking great photos. and considering my sister is now sharing this camera with me, we've probably taken over 1000 photos. so i guess you have a 50/50 chance! make sure you save the box!","great camera, especially for the price you pay. about it being the \"worst, most crappy camera ever known to man.\" yeah, if you move the camera while taking pictures, the picture is going to be a little blurry, but that happens with any camera, even an SLR that takes film. the videos? no where does it say that they playback with sound. and having to save pictures? i don't know what camera that person was using, but it's not true with this camera. this camer takes great quality pictures, i used it for 3 months in germany and it never let me down, and i continue to use it over a year later. about the LCD not showing anything: just push the DISP/BACK button once and you've got it. otherwise, the LCD got turned off, which you can fix by going to the menu and turning it back on. i dont know, maybe the kodak easy share is a better camera for someone who has no idea how to take a picture. you do have to have some idea what you're doing with this camera, like how to take a decent picture, but even if you don't, it's easy enough to get the hang of it.","One week after the warranty expired, nearly all my shots had horizontal lines on them. I took it to the Fuji Service Center in Thailand and they diagnozed the lens was at fault. The charge to replace/repair was $95.00. So not a good bargain after all.","I am in college and wanted a digital camera to capture all those priceless memories, and this Fuji does a pretty good job.  First thing that attracted me the msot was the price.  I actually bought mine in a combo set that included a printer for $170.  The only bad thing about the printer is I though that it was just a normal printer that hooked up to your computer, but it's a camera compatible printer only, and it's just as big as a normal printer.  Back to the camera.  It's basic functions are pretty easy to use.  I'm one of those people who don't really read a manual, I just jump into it and figure it out.  At first, I couldn't figure some things out like how to view my pictures I just took.  But after a few minutes of button pushing, I figured it out.  The quality of pictures on my computer seems really great.  I haven't printed any prints yet, but I have faith that it will be great.  It's fairly small in size, but I wish it was smaller like an Elph.  Overall, I think that this is a great camera for the low-budget starter or for someone who doesn't care a whole lot about printing every picture that they take.  This isn't a camera I would buy if I had a bigger budget though.","I purchased this camera yesterday. It is easy to use, takes great pics, color is exceptional. My son has a Cannon sureshot and in my opinion this Fuji has great color. I'm so pleased with the purchase of this camera. I'm still learning but I must say my decision to purchase this camera was based on the photos I reviewed on customer images. I'm not sorry I chose this little camera.","This is my second digital camera and I LOVE it! I was impressed with indoor photos and natural light photos. The zoom quality is great. Perfect size to fit in a small purse and to take out at night without being cumbersome. All the menu options are easy to use & obvious to understand,for those of us who hate reading direction booklets. The only complaint I have would be the \"movie mode\" in dimmer settings, it was SO DARK! It also doesn't come with ANY extras; no camera case, rechargable battery, etc...<br />All in all, I love it! Seems to be a great price for it too! Yay Target!","My first digital camera, but I love it! It's super easy to use and you can easily get your pictures on to your computer. The software it comes with is completely useless and poorly designed, but you don't need it for anything. A great product!","I recently received this camera as a Christmas gift, along with a spare 128 MB xD card. I was a new user to the world of digital cameras and I was shooting perfect pictures within minutes. I had a few bad shots (due to my own flubs); but all in all my pictures were wonderful, beautiful, & crystal clear images. Between 12/25 and 1/02 I have taken over 150 pictures. I have to go through a few steps to get the pictures transfered to my PC (which is easy, if you can follow directions) and onto CD rom, and not being a patient person that is a lot of trouble--that is certainly well worth it. It certainly beats having to wait 2 hrs at Wal-Mart trying to get 2 rolls of film developed (in one hour) after someone had dropped off 19 rolls to be developed at the one hour photo there. I would recommend rechargable batteries, depending on how much of a shutterbug you are. I like the fact it is small and compact, enough so I carry in in my shoulder bag everywhere. The resolution is super and since I don't need any picture bigger than an 8 x 10 (where the heck would I store or pack something that size?) I don't mind it being 3.2 MP. This wasn't the first camera I was looking at when I was asked what I wanted--but am glad my mom gave me this one--now she wants one too, and she is quite resistant to new technology. All that being said our old 35mm camera only worked with Fuji film (no other film would have pictures that developed, only pictures taken with Fuji would develop); and this product stands up to a great experience we have had with their products. I recommend this for starters, people who want to simply click and save their photos and are not interested in \"editing\"  or anyone who wants an inexpensive digital camera; but keep all the accessories in the box :)","This is a small, sleek, fun and cute camera!  It takes great pictures in a variety of photographic settings which are easily customizable for the more advanced photographer, or a simple to use \"Auto\" mode for the novice.  The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because it doesn't come with a case (can be purchased separately for under $20) and because some of the menu features are not as simple as they could be.  I also had a bit of confusion when first downloading the pictures to the computer, but these were minor inconveniences that I soon worked around.  The camera is both great fun to use, and produces quality prints or digital files!  I would definitely recommend it!","I am not a photographer and am not really an expert about cameras but I've gotten a lot of good use out of this one.  My main camera is a Sony DSC-S30, which is bigger and heavier and more expensive and which I tend to handle with great care.<br /><br />If that camera were a pair of Ray Bans, the Fuji A330 is like a pair of drugstore sunglasses; I wanted a little camera with optical zoom that I could stuff in my pocket and use without too much worry and this is it.  I also got one for my folks, who were iffy about dipping into digital but they found it easy to use.  It's a good starter camera and it comes with its own memory card and batteries, which means if you're gifting it you have everything in one unintimidating box.<br /><br />As someone else here wrote, rechargable batteries are definitely recommmended. And I, too, wish the camera had audio to go with the video but, for the price and size, I can live without that.","This is an awesome camera. It takes really great pictures in a room that is dimly lit. Everything came out crisp and clear.  I just got it yesterday, so I am still playing with it. Picture transfer from the camera to my computer was so simple and very quick.","This is my second Fuji, my first was the MX-1200.  It took great pictures, nothing last for ever.  So now I own the A330 and it's<br />standing up to my old one even better.  What I like is that you can be in a dim lighted room and take a picture that comes out as if you had all the lights on. Fuji has my business.  Also it's very easy to use.","This camera is easy to use, easy to carry around in your backpack or purse, though not so easy to break. I've dropped it plenty of times and it stands up against my brutality. I have a 35mm and a digital SLR that I use when I want to take better pictures, but the quality is fine for snapshots or random things you find around town.","You're probably considering the Fuji A330 because you either want a good reliable point-and-shoot or simply because you want a really good deal. I've owned several digital point-and-shoots and even digital cameras several times the price of the A330 so the enclosed points speak from a fairly varied experience of digital camera usage over a 4 year period.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />1. The photos are generally good quality when taken outdoors. Compared to other point and shoot cameras at least. But you'll instantly notice the difference in photo quality if you choose to buy (for example) a 3 MP camera at twice this price. (I also own the Canon PowerShot IS and love the vivid color in the photos there.)<br /><br />2. If someone tells you 3 MP is not enough, ignore them unless you need to make prints larger than 8x10 (when did you make blow ups with a 35mm camera anyway???)<br /><br />3. Battery life is decent. Please do invest in rechargeables. A worthy investment. Make sure you get a smart charger, not a dumb one (enough product information and review material on Amazon to help you learn more on this if you would like.)<br /><br />4. You'll appreciate the 3x zoom though instantly crave for more.<br /><br />5. There is not much else out there in the market under one hundred and fifty dollars. So if this is a gift, you've got a good starter camera to give with the additional accessories to be bought later by the recipient.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />1. XD cards are at least 40% more expensive than compact flash cards. Negates the whole concept of getting a really good deal. (Though there is currently a free memory card offer on Amazon that's worth looking at.)<br /><br />2. Start up time at 3.3 seconds (according to Fuji at least) is still slow. That means you are guaranteed to miss a good action shot since time from start to click is at least 6 seconds (unless the word `draw' reminds you of the Wild Wild West and not your kindergarten days...)<br /><br />3. If your really plan to take some video footage, you'll regret, soon enough, the lack of audio. Be prepared to be disappointed. I suggest you strongly consider a camera with audio. You can use Windows Movie Maker to add audio in later but you'll probably not find time to learn to use this efficiently enough.<br /><br />4. its `just' a little too bulky to put into your pant pocket and still be completely comfortable. Especially if you have a carrying case with the camera.<br /><br />The Ugly<br /><br />None really.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />A great starter camera. You cant go wrong with this purchase if this is your first digital camera. I'm being a little critical here because I'd like to share my likes and dislikes of this purchase. But I guarantee you, at this price,  or for a starter camera, you'll be hard pressed to find anything better.","This is my first digital camera, but it's easy to use.  I like how it's so small and light that I can carry it with me in my pocket.<br /><br />Pictures are good quality, my only complaint about the pictures is that outdoor photos at dusk or in evening shadows tend to easily blur slightly due to long shutter speeds when the subject is too far away for the flash to be effective.  I don't know if other digital cameras have the same problem as much but this can be fixed by using a tripod or shooting when it's brighter.<br /><br />Another minor quibble is that it's not as easy to change the settings as it could/should be.  To change between night mode to sport mode, for example, I have to go to the menu and scroll through the options.<br /><br />As I understand it, the camera is very good on batteries, I took about 250 pictures (albeit in the span of 3 days) before I had to replace the batteries that came with it.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this camera, it's small, easy to use, and much cheaper than a similar Canon.  One thing to consider is the price of memory, though.  This camera uses xD memory, which is slightly more expensive (though smaller) than some other kinds.","What a pleaser to finaly get a Camera that works for my specific needs that I use it for.As I take my company's product pics with it and most of the time the colors and evrything comes out perfect only time its not perfect is when my lighting is in correct and the high res. and low res options also is fantastic.","This is my second digital camera in 5 years - handed down the old one to the kids.  I was hesitant to give up my old one because of how easy it was to use (an old HP model)but it was bulky and I wanted some new features.  I bought the Sony DSC P32 and hated how complicated it was.  I hung on to it for 90 days hoping I could dedicate a week or so to reading about how to use the darn thing when I finally gave up and returned it.  I was referred to the Fuji A330 for ease of use.  It is so easy, my kids use it!  It takes great pictures all around - inside, outside, light or dark.  The software also is much better than what came with the Sony I returned.  A friend bought the Nikon 3200 and we compared our cameras to eachother.  We found them to have practically identical features except that the Fuji is about $50 less so I know I get the better deal.  One very important thing to keep in mind is that the software be user friendly.  Even if you find a camera that you like, if the software stinks, you won't get the best use out of your camera.  The software with the Fuji is good.","This camera is a lot smaller than the last year model, Fuji FinePix A210 and costs about 20 to 30 dollars more.  I bought this camera  based on the reviews on the A210.  This is my second digital camera.  The camera comes with 2 Alkaline batteries, a 16M xD memory card.  I use 2 NimH rechargeable batteries instead.  It doesn't come with a case.<br />The Fuji A330 camera is a point-and-shoot camera that has red eye reduction.  I was able to operate without reading the instruction manual.  Under bight light, the LCD screen is very fade and hard to see.  If you want to download the pictures to the computer, you will need to install the USB driver.  I have Windows 2000 and the software installation is a snap.<br />The outdoor pictures are acceptable.  However I was disappointed with indoor pictures. Even at a 4-5 feet range, the pictures were  dark.","This is a great camera for a novice. If you are taking a picture of fast moving objects or people, you would want to use the sport mode. Otherwise, just set the camera and light settings to &quot;Auto&quot; and you're done!"]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix A340","amazon_reviews":["The fact that the toggle switch on the back of the camera --  that not only controls the Zoom but also controls all the command options on the LED -- seems to be the WEAK point, and not just for me -- mine is now kaput.<br /><br />The rest of the camera functions just fine and I have ENJOYED using this camera for more than 3 years.

And both models it can do RAW, in which the S3 hasd Live Image feature also I use my Nikkor manual focus lenses in which the quality of image is very improve with the sharpness, and contrast, and though that I have the guess the exposure but I still have my external meter. Plus my S2 & S3 takes AA batteries that also have Built In grips so I do not have to buy external grips which they cost $200. Now FYI the S2 only takes 2GB card maximum card but the S3 will take 8 GB card maximum but the process time is a bit slower. So only use both models for pictorial use. If you want fast action models I go with the 5D.

I still have this wonderful machine and the colors from it are just remarkable!  Yes, it is a 6 megapixel camera, and I have printed images up to 20x30 with no pixelation and no blurring.  Customers have asked me how I get the colors so beautiful. I tell them that it is the camera's ccd sensor. It is too bad that they are not continuing their Pro Line of cameras.  The Fuji S5 Pro was the last model.  But, this camera is still operating and giving me fantastic images.","I bought this camera from Amazon.com couple of months ago (sometime in April of 2007). At the time, the newer model of Fuji DSLR, the S5, was just introduced. Although the S5 offers a lot of improvements, I decided to buy the S3. I had also looked at the Nikon SLR since I have been using Nikon for the past 35 years. I had seen many photographs taken with all of the models that I was interest in (except the Fuji-S5) and they were very close in terms of quality. Now it boiled down to other things and it was not the money issue, but in my case, the battery issue. The S3 uses 4-AA rechargable batteries. I did not buy a Nikon DSLR or the Fuji-S5 because of the use of proprietary batteries.<br /><br />I have been using the Fuji-S3 along with my Nikon-F4 film camera for the past two months and I am VERY VERY please with the results. I had captured over 3000 images during my 3 week vacation with it. I had carefully examined a few hundred of the pictures I took (just in case that I didn't like the camera) and I discovered that it can deliver an exceptional quality. It shares the same Nikon lenses and I am fortunate that I have not had any incompatibility issues (I was warned about this). As of this writing, my F4 is probably going to join the F1 in the collection shelf....soon. I also bought two newer lenses from Sigma (I had never bought anything else other than the Nikon lenes) to try with the camera. Those Sigma lenses appear to diliver similar quality or in one case better than my Nikon lenses with this camera.<br /><br />One complain...the ISO and the timer buttons of the S3 are placed in the most awkward positions. I am lucky that I don't change the ISO or using timer that offen otherwise this would have been one most inconvenient.","This camera has been very enjoyable to use.  Very comfortable large grip when handheld, nice for tripod use too.  I decided on this camera when comparing images of those taken by other digital SLR's.  The S3 images were the only ones that didn't appear \"obviously\" digital to me.  I seem to find film images more aesthetically pleasing, which the S3 provides.  This is my first digital SLR and has more features than I could possibly hope for.  I still have not explored all the film simulation and wide dynamic range combinations and options.  I found the the F2 velvia setting a bit \"too\" saturated, and the built in sharpening also a bit \"hard\".  I get the best results in wide dynamic 2 mode, 12mp, and everything else set to \"normal\".  Usually requires some brief post processing in the contrast and sharpening departments to get the results I'm looking for.  I love the results in black and white.  Love the aperture and shutter priority modes.  My only gripe is that the external USB port became loose after about a dozen uses and just fell into the camera body.  I sent it back on warranty however, and it was fixed and sent back to me in about a 4 day window.  I was really amazed with Fujifilm service.  As for speed, I usually shoot landscapes, and in jpeg mode, so not really an issue. I have shot fast moving birds and wildlife with no problems.  As for value, its worth about 3/4 of its original price on the used market after around 9 months of use, not bad for digital cameras I suppose.  And the price of a new one has actually increased since I bought one, which is hard to believe, but great!  The Fuji S3 continues to please. :) enjoy.","great pictures but too slow for anything but still portraits and landscapes","i've got the fuji s2 for 3 yrs now, been waiting and save for an s3 until now, i got my s3 on ebay used in great cond for 1245$, it came in very good cond like new. my 1st impression was the nicer grip, the body is in flat, dull black, not like s2 is more on shiny side.the rubber parts on s3 is very sticky, gives nicer gripping.the build is more solid than the s2.i've noticed the battery door is alot more sturdy than s2,the use of it is pretty much same as s2, so there is no problem with operation to me..i tested shot it about 100 shots, i noticed right away the wide dynamic range on s3, the colors seem brighter and more contrast, the af is faster.the sharpness come from your lenses..i use it with tamron 28-105 f2.8 sp model, it gives me awesome results.works better with my tokina af 80-200mm f2.8.s3 got the new vertical trigger, it uses only 4 aa batts, not like s2 with 2 sets of batts.the s3 body is fatter than s2,not too heavy or light, its just feels right..i shot jpeg only. i shoot mostly weddings and models, plus landscapes..the slow review on s3 is anoying,the refreshing time is slow. to review your shots is slow too, but with my work its not a problem.<br /><br />in all s3 produces great results, far more better than any other dslrs ive own.thats including canon 300d and olympus e300.will use s3 and s2 for wedding.im a happy fotoman.","This is the first digital camera which made me forget the film, after 27 years of photography experience. The image quality is beyond expectation. The performance is much slower compared to current Nikon dSLR models, including much more affordable Nikon D70. However, I owned D70 for about 1 year and could not treat it as a \"real camera\" because both the resolution of D70 is lower than that of good scams from 35mm film and the dynamic range is not as good. The S3 Pro IS The Real Camera. In terms of color rendition and dynamic range, it OUTPERFORMS the latest 35mm professional slide film. At the beginning, I was not happy with resolution (I could not see visible advantage over 6Mp Nikon D70), but this was actually an issue of lenses used. At 12 Mp mode, images looked too \"interpolated\" (they ARE partially interpolated but do not confuse this with upscaling of 6Mp files to 12 Mp - the sensor does have more resolution than 6 Mp - please read reviews about Super CCD design elsewhere). This \"insufficient resolution\" feeling was a result of using medium-quality Nikkor 24-85mm lens. This lens is good at 6 Mp but in 12 Mp mode its resolution is not enough to take advantage of the whole resolution of the camera sensor. When I put on a 55mm Micro-Nikkor, the resolution became shocking great! I could not see interpolation at 100% crop of 12 Mp images! The in-camera JPEGs are great, \"robust\" and do not usually need postprocessing. I usually stick to \"normal\" color and \"original\" tone settings, which helps to preserve more information in different lighting settings but sometimes this results in need of slight fine-tuning of the contrast. If you don't like postprocessing at all, use \"standard\" color AND \"standard\" tone instead. In most cases, images taken in this mode are almost perfect for printing right out of the camera. Downside: the camera performs relatively slow: if you take several shots in a row in RAW mode, the camera may be locked for half a minute (!) to write the files, and speed of reviewing the images is also awfully low. But I can easily accept these because the joy of having images of such high quality makes the incoveniences of slow performance insignificant for me.","Fine old camera.

For starters, some of these reviewers should read the manual that came with the camera. It has a 3.0 times zoom that only works when the display is on. Simply push the right direction button to zoom in, left direction button to zoom out. As for battery life, buy the Energizer lithiums, they last quite awhile. Regular AA batteries never last long in digital cameras. We've had this camera for about seven years, and with all the handling, dropping, and abuse by the kids, it's still going strong. As far as quality, it takes as good if not better pictures than the Canon A Series.","I bought this as a gift for my nine year old daughter.  It's great.  Not complicated to work at all.  Bought it used and still in great working order.  Only negative is that it doesn't have a button to zoom.  You have to use the display (instead of the view hole) and then you are able to zoom.  It took us a little while to discover this.","I bought the Kodak CX7300 about maybe 5 yrs ago and it is great for first time buyers and if you do not want to capture action shots.  The pictures turn out great if you are close up to a subject or outside.  Action shots don't come out very well because of the slow shutter speed and the zoom is very grainy when picture is developed. It also takes too long in between shots.  Overall a good first timers camera.","This camera is a good basic camera taking pretty good pics. It doesn't hold battery life to the best extent. It is a good starter camera but isn't the best.","I was excited about this camera because of the megapixels and the Kodak name. I ended up being very disappointed.<br />CONS:<br />+ Eats batteries like you wouldn't believe. You'd better always carry extras, because you're definitely going to go through them while you're snapping pics.<br />+ I get more out-of-focus images than anything else.<br />+ There is no zoom, so you need to be very close to your subject. Much like disposable cameras, you take a picture of something close by and it prints out like it's a million miles away. But, if you get too close, it'll be blurry.<br />+ The wheel on top of the camera used to turn it on and select different modes is in a really bad place. If you buy a case or bag for the camera, often it will turn on accidentally.<br />+ It takes a long time after you snap a photo before you can take another photo. That irritates me!<br />PROS:<br />+ Inexpensive<br />+ It has some good features, like different flash modes, a self-timer, stuff that a lot of cheaper cameras don't include<br />+ You can get a docking station to print directly from the camera - no computer needed<br />+ Once you add in a memory card, you can take a ton more pictures. I got a 128MB and it holds about 150 pics, in addition to the internal memory.","This was the first decent digital cameras I have ever owned. I am not sure what the deal is with people complaining about battery life. Buy a recharger. I used the same batteries for the two years I have owned this camera. I have run into glitches from time to time that are most likely due to me putting the batteries in there when they were not fully charged(yes I am inpatient) Sometimes the camera looks like it took a picture and then it crashes. Other times it will not turn off. Opening and re-closing the battery door always fixes it. I am sure that both of these issues are due to me putting the weak batteries in.<br /><br />As for durability? I am not sure what the deal is with people complaining about no lens cover. Who cares? I have dropped this camera so many times I cannot even begin to count! This thing is built really well!! I never worry about putting the camera down with the lens up. I just toss it on my desk when I am done with it. Still takes great pictures. I have bitched about this camera from time to time but I have taken nearly 1100 pictures with it and it is still going strong. Now that memory cards are so cheap, I finally bought one for the camera. A 1 gig one will let you take 4000(!!!) low definition pictures. Of course low def is like 1024x768 on this camera. My only beef is why not have VGA resolution anymore? I always have to shrink the pics down to use this with eBay.","This is a great camera. The quality is good and the camera is very durable. I've accidently dropped the camera several times, and it still works. However, I would suggest getting a memory card if you want to take more than 24 pictures at a time.","This camera is good for beginers, and for quick snapshots.  However, there is no optical zoom on the camera, making any picture that has been zoomed in very pixelated and blurry.  Even thought it has 3.2 megapixels, I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the picture.","I bought it almost a year ago, and I also bought the CRV3 battery. That's the perfect combo. I used and abused it for 4 months and not worrying about buying new batteries. Yeah, It doesn't have zoom, or macro option, but you only need it in a proffesional level (I work in advertising). So, go to a road trip, party or any family event, you won't need anything else, your camera, the CRV3 battery and some more memory for it. Even my 5 years old niece can take good pics with it.","i  read  other  people's  review's  and  it  sound like  a  great  camera","I got this camera about 3 months ago and it is still working great!  It takes fantastic pictures and has a long battery life.  The only down fall is the internal memory.  It holds about 20 pictures by itself but you can easily by a memory card for 15 bucks that can hold 150 more!  The camera is a great price and you can use it right out of the box.","This camera is excellent for its price.  I wanted an easy automatic point & shoot and I wanted the best for the least amount of money!  I have several excellent film cameras, and I love point & push after years of manual settings.  I never thought I would ever leave my Leica Mini behind on a trip, but on my last vacation I took only the KODAK.  Get a 256 memory card, and get the lithium battery - I bought mine in June 05 - battery still fine after a couple of hundred pics.  You must remember not to get closer than the recommended distance, and the camera is all auto - fixed focus, no manul exposure.  There are several flash settings and a delay setting, and a few distance presets.  Strictly the Brownie Hawkeye of today (although the Brownies were much hardier), and thats fine.  You have to know this, and not expect more.  The major failing of this camera is the battery door, which is the most flimsy and hard to shut little thing. I cannot imagine that it will last long if opened frequently. It is really difficult to mash in the battery while closing the tiny plastic door. All the camera buttons, etc., are rather small, but this is standard in digicams. DO NOT DROP this - this is not built to drop - I would not recomend it for active children or active sport, although with constant wearing of the wrist loop and extra care, I have not dropped it.  KODAK EASY SHARE software is \"easy\". I stopped using my photo manipulation software routinely and now use KODAK EASYSHARE, and just take the easy way and order prints and other photo items from KODAK GALLERY (formerly Ofoto).  Service is fast and excellent.  Great starter camera, you won't want to mess with film again unless you are a pro.  I use a Mac running OS X, and the software is not only compatible, but Mac friendly and nice to look at!  I have seen the Windows version, and it is not nearly as nice looking as the Mac version - thank you KODAK! I do not use iPhoto.  Easyshare does not duplicate photos - it uses your own folder setup, which I really like.","I've really enjoyed this little camera. I did the usual, checked out all of the reviews, and I agree that it's a great beginner camera for a nice price. The picture quality is excellent, and uploading the shots is a snap. I don't have the extra card for additional memory, but this is rarely a problem for me, as I'm always near a computer and can upload. I highly recommend it for recording the little day to day actions of life- it's fun and extremely user friendly!","I purchased this camera because it was cheap and good price for a 3.2 MP LCD digital. I still have and use it. I regret not learning how to save photos, all my pixs with ASIN- filipino singer and honeymoon at Boracay got deletd somehow... however it's definetly worth the price and perfect 1st time camera. It also does have a video capture.... although red eye reduction doesn't quite reduce the red just turns it green...","First it's a good camera for less than $100 bucks. As to the power switch turning its self on, so what! it has an auto power down feature. If your batteries are dead, invest in a rechargeable set. $20.00 @ most discount retailers. Fuzzy pictures, hold the thing still, the shutter has a delay. It's a camera not a laser, inexpensive technology has not come that far yet. Download your pictures without a dock. First, all D.C. come with a USB cord. Fragile things, If you have ham fists. Try picking up thumbtacks with a pair of tweezers, or other exercises to develop your fine motor skills. Once this kindergarten level task is mastered, move up to double digit IQ tasks like inserting USB cords. Bottom line: good entry level camera, too many whiny 21st century trendoids with no technical skills (read the Dilbert Future for more on these types)","I don't know anything about cameras or computers and have never worked with them.  This camera is extremely easy to use. I had no trouble reading the directions to set it up. I took 14pics and went down to the drugstore. I had to buy something called a sd card which is a little p-lastic thing to make the pics. They came out with such rich natural color. It was very easy to use the drugstore machine.  I took pictures of a bright blue subaru.  Have not tried the video or motion parts yet.  Even in sulight the screen is easy to see.  The reviews that said this is ideal for beginners were right. I'm 60 and a bit leary of gadgts but the drugstore machine was very easy to use.  I love this camera, will end up taking more pics than I had ment to, it is such fun to use.","The resolution indoors was not fantastic, but expected.  However, I noticed some other reviewer complaining about the batteries being difficult to find because of the special need for a specific battery type.<br /><br />This is not true.<br /><br />I plugged in plain old Duracell cheapos and it worked fine.  Do not hesitate to buy this camera because of this complaint, because it is a false complaint.<br /><br />The camera works very nice for the price, and traveling with it is easy and you don't worry too much about it getting stolen, cause it ain't worth much.<br /><br />Also, don't worry about the SD disk that someone else complained about, they are available in most stores (Target, Wal-Mart) as well as here on amazon, look it up.","I have been using this camera for 4 months and really like it.  I have taken around 500 pictures and the majority come out great.  Without using the viewfinder I can take about 100-150 pictures with and without flash before the batteries need to be replaced.  I purchased a 256 MB card for it and according to the LCD it can hold ~270 pictures at max resolution.<br /><br />To comment on some of the other comments, I haven't had any problem  with the lens cover or the camera turning itself on/off.  I do keep it in a bag most of the time.  I used the internal USB connector a few times but have switched to simply pulling the SD card out and using a USB reader, it's much faster.<br /><br />My only gripe about the camera is the redeye.  If the flash is used inside or outside at night, redeye is almost guaranteed.  I don't know if it's because there is no redeye reduction or b/c the flash is so close to the lens.  I end up correcting the redeye in about 90% of the pictures I take at night/inside.<br /><br />The camera is also a little slow to start up but it's manageable.  All in all I would buy this camera again.","Great camera here.  Worth the $100 I've spent for it.  Takes great quality pics.  I read the reviews on this camera and thought I'd give it a shot.  I'm sure glad I did.  If you want your very first digital camera, spend the $100 on this one.  You'll be glad you did.","I just bought this camera last week for my 17 yr. old son to take to prom.  I didn't want to spend alot of money on an expensive digital for him and from all the reviews I had read it seemed like the perfect camera.  This is the BEST camera I have ever purchased!!  It's so easy to use, the pictures turn out great....I could not be happier.  I used the PICASA program from google to store my pictures on and printed them out right from my own printer on picture paper and they turned out better than in the store.<br /><br />Could not be happier with my purchase!  Well worth the money!!!","I like this camera, and when ordering it, trying to be prepared, I ordered extra alkaline batteries and a memory card and a camera carrying case.  I read the instruction book and in there it says DO NOT USE ALKALINE BATTERIES!  I took a look at the batteries in the camera, and they are Oxy-alkalines.  What's that?  I looked all over the Kodak Web site - nothing.  I e-mailed the customer service and they sent me back to the Kodak Web site (nothing there, remember?) and after several e-mails I was linked to a Web site in CHINA!  The minimum order was 200,000 batteries!  I did a Web search and found nothing.  I finally wrote the CEO of Kodak, and he forwarded my letter to a very nice man in the Kodak organization who answered every question I had.  He linked me up to a Web site that has the batteries here in the USA and they are very reasonably priced.  He also told me that lithium batteries are NOT rechargeables (which I did not know) and would last longer than the oxy-alkalines!  So if you aren't able to invest in a recharger and rechargeable batteries ([...] then try the lithium batteries available on Kodak's Web site.  Or get the Oxy-alkalines at [...] I hope this helps save you some frustration when it comes to the batteries.  My camera was supposed to come with lithium batteries but they ran out and included the oxy-alkalines instead.","I am very impressed with this product. For a mere $100, I was able to get 3.2 megapixel pictures with great color. The camera options were easy to figure out and use.<br /><br />One thing I want to add, on top of all the already superb reviews here, is that its compatibility with the Linux operating system is great.<br /><br />I run Fedora Core 3 on my home computer, and all I had to do was plug the USB cable into my computer and it recognized the camera, the pictures, and gave me all the options I needed to downloads the pics. I didn't have to install any software all! It all happened automatically. I am very impressed.<br /><br />I have no complaints at all.","When I went searching for a digital camera, I was looking for something inexpensive with at least 3 megapixels (which is enough for simple pictures and website publishing) and the ability to transfer pictures easily in multiple ways.  I never imagined I could get that for $100.  I have been very satisfied with the Kodak CX7300 and would recommend it highly.  But since you are getting it for such a steal, you should also invest in some accessories to make your life easier.<br /><br />A cable and software are included with the camera, so you can download pictures easily by pressing the one-touch \"share\" button (once you have the software loaded on your computer).  But you basically have to download all of your pictures at once and you are using up your batteries somewhat as you do that.  Kodak also makes docking stations that work with all their cameras, but I wanted to get something that could work with other electronic devices as well.  So I also purchased SanDisk ImageMate 5 in 1 Reader (under $20) and a Viking 512 MB Secure Digital Flash Card (under $50 from Amazon) -- which is less than most docking stations.  The storage capacity on the CX7300 alone is very minimal (16MB), so you will definitely want to pick up some type of flash memory card.  512 MB may be more than you need to buy, but it sure makes your life easier.  I actually still have not filled up the card and I've been taking lots of pictures for over a month now.  The SanDisk device makes transferring pictures to any computer easy, since it is just like using an external disk drive that plugs into a USB port.  The combination of the two helps conserve batteries (I still have not changed them) and is very easy to figure out.  I never read a manual on any of this (including the camera, which is very user-friendly), and I wouldn't call myself a \"tech guru\" by any means.<br /><br />One small reservation about the camera's design: the on-switch is a turning wheel on top of the camera and so it can easily turn itself on as you slip it into a pocket or backpack and it rubs against a surface that turns the wheel.  I've often found my camera in the \"on\" position as I took it out.  But this does not seem to have done anything obvious to my battery life, so there may be a sort of sleep mode if it is left on for a long period (I haven't investigated this fully).<br /><br />I'd also recommend you pick up some lithium batteries.  Friends recommended rechargable batteries, but I can't be bothered and the initial cost is discouraging.  I find I'm getting lots of battery life.","I really like the camera. However if you get one get the printer dock too. I down loaded pictures off to my computer with the cheesey cable pluged into the side MAYBE 4 times and it quit working. The small wires located inside the camera that attach to the cable got stuck and bent. Now I have to buy a dock for the camera to download pictures to my computer. Though it should work longer than that...and believe me I was being very careful because the connection looked alittle fragile.","My family bought my mother-in-law one of these for Christmas and it was her first ever digital camera.  I really pushed to get a Kodak camera because I have a 3+ year-old DX3500 which still works great and is easy to use.  However, there have been a couple of irritations with this CX7300 and I see at least one complaint already mentioned here.  Unlike my older model, this one doesn't have a cover or even a way to cover the plastic clear lens which covers the actual lens.  Thus, you can easily leave fingerprints or whatever on there and obviously that would affect the photos.  The bigger complaint is that she received a simple camera bag to hold this in and it fits nicely inside if not a little tight.  However, this has caused an annoying problem.  The on/off switch is on the top of the camera and it easily turns on when the camera is put into our pulled out of the camera case.  Albeit, the case didn't come with the camera, however, it was a surprise that the switch could be turned on so easily and often without being aware of it.  The result of this is that batteries tend to die more quickly.  I write this only for the benefit of anyone who purchases this camera to realize they should select a camara carrying case that is not too tight fitting.  I don't really have a solution to offer since I haven't had a chance to take the camera to a store and try other cases.  Maybe another owner of this camera can comment on their success with this.  Also, I would never take a photo without setting the resolution at its highest, thus I would recommend purchasing at least a 128MB or higher memory card.  I think in my mother-in-law's case we went with a 256Mb card, just in case she should ever want to use the video feature.  Enjoy your Kodak camera!","Picture quality is superb! Movie mode is great, just wish there was sound too. For the price, this is a gem. Ez to use and a snap to work!","THIS IS MY FIRST DIGITAL CAMERA, AND I AM VERY VERY HAPPY WITH IT.  IT'S EASY TO USE, RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.  GOOD PRICE, AND THE PICTURES ARE GREAT.<br /><br />IT COMES WITH SOFTWARE TO GET YOU PUTTING YOUR PICTURES ONLINE AND EMAILING THEM RIGHT AWAY.<br /><br />GREAT CAMERA GREAT PRICE, HIGHLY RECOMENDED!","I was skeptical due to the low price. But this camera takes clear sharp pictures with great detail and high resolution. The 'Auto Mode' makes it simple to take shots. Everything is easy. The pictures are breathtaking!<br />State of the art, it does everything you need, for viewing your pictures on the pc and/or for prints. No other digital camera comes close at this great price. No wonder it's often sold-out almost everywhere.","I bought this camera as a gift for a family member because the price was very reasonable and the reviews said it was a great start up digital camera even for the technologically unsavy. Although it is very very easy to use and share the pictures, the photo quality leaves much to be desired. Outdoor photos are fine for a 3.2 megapixel camera, but the indoor photos it snapped are pretty bad- extremely grainy and dark (even with the flash!). I really don't recommend this camera unless you only need it for outdoor use.","I just recently purchased this camera because I bought a more expensive model with lots of &quot;Goodies&quot; on it and was very dissapointed with that model. This little Kodak is easy to use and does one heck of a job. Had no problem with it from the beginning and would happily recommend this to anyone, especially people who are not &quot;High Tech-Minded&quot;. Kodak came through for us again..thanks Kodak!!","Hello my name is casey i am 14 years old i got my first kodak camera when i was about ten i loved i absolutely love this new one it rocks hello all you red eye people i dont care how inexpensive the camera is the red eye is going to sometimes allways happen dont let those other reviews stop you from buying such a great camera. like every camera this kodak comes with P.C. software hello there is a red eye tool that make it vanish","I wanted a digital camera for some time, but with so many out there I had no idea which one to get. I decided because it's my first camera I'd get a cheaper one, and since Kodak is a trusted name in photography I went with theirs. Well, I'm loving this CX7300. For $100 dollars the picture quality is superb. 3.2 MP is enough for me - the casual user.<br /><br />Armed with my 256MB SD Card, and some rechargeables I take it with me everywhere. At best quality, I can take 300+ pictures. The red eye and night features are added bonuses and the abilty to take short (soundless) movie clips is always handy. I dont like however, that the clips are saved in Quicktime (.mov) format. One other downside is you shouldn't expect much from the 3x digital zoom.<br /><br />I never installed the bundled software nor have i ever connected the camera to my pc. I just take the card out a slip into the reader when I need to save or have a little fun with Photoshop. I plan to keep this camera for a while and use it like crazy. I'm so glad I didn't get one of those expenxive ones, this CX7300 is all I need!","THIS CAMERA IS SO FUN! FIRST OF ALL I LIKE HOW EASY IT IS TO USE. SECOND OF ALL I LIKE ALL THE DIFFERENT SETTINGS YOU CAN PUT YOUR PICTURES ON, AND THIRD OF ALL I LIKE THE SIZE AND SYLE OF THIS CAMERA. I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO GET IT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR YOUR FIRST DIGITAL CAMERA BECAUSE ITS PERFECT!","I received this camera for Christmas and I love it! It is really easy to use  and it doesn't take a brain scientist to know how to operate it! I haven't yet printed out any pictures, but I like how easy it really is! The software program really works great too! I would recommend this camera anytime!","This is not my first digital camera. My first one is a Mavica 0.3 Mega pixel.<br />  This Kodak camera is small but powerfull. I was able to take it out of the box, pop in the 2 batteries that come in the box and push in a 256 mb SD card and off I went. I set the camera to 3 stars *** which means best quality and the screen told me I have 306 pics left to take...I don't know about you but that beats a roll of 36 exposure 35mm film anyday (and not to mention the 21 photos per floppy disc with the Mavica).<br />  The auto setting, controls  all settings. I took about 40 shots so far, put the SD card into the SD reader in my computer, without installing the software from the Kodak box that came with the camera ( YOU MUST INSTALL THE SOFTWARE FIRST INTO YOUR COMPUTER BEFORE YOU ATTACH YOUR CAMERA TO YOUR COMPUTER VIA USB CABLE OR DOCKING SYSTEM...KODAK SAYS THIS 4 TIMES IN THE INSRUCTIONS).. and boom there they where, great, clear, crisp and colorfull shots. The indoor shots of things like flowers and people and a few cats where the bomb (that's good).<br />  The outdoor night shots looked like a painting...(thats good too)...OK NOW FOR SOME FACTS: YOU MUST GET THE FOLLOWING WHEN YOU BUY THIS CAMERA...RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES AND RECHARGER...I PCKED UP THE SONY BRAND FOR $19.00 AT AMAZON..KODAK DOES NOT WANT YOU TO USE AA ALKALINES...YOU MUST GET A CASE..$9.00 IN WALLMART OR KMART OR AMAZON...YOU MUST GET A 256MB SD CARD...DONT FOOL AROUND WITH ANYTHING LESS CAUSE YOU'LL LOVE HAVING MEMORY FOR 300 PHOTOS AT BEST QUALITY OR 1000 PHOTOS AT GOOD QUALITY...SD CARD 256MB AROUND $30 AT AMAZON OR WALLMART...EVEN COSTCO....OH ONE MORE THING I GOT FOR THE CAMERA WAS A NECK STRAP, THE WRIST STRAP THAT COMES IN THE BOX IS ...WELL A WRIST STRAP..THE NECK STRAP MUST HAVE THE LOOP AT THE BOTTOM TO ATTACH TO THE CAMERA...ABOUT $9.00 I GOT MINE ON eBAY....<br />  In conclusion...buy this camera","I think its a great little camera. I am happy with the picture quality. It takes a little work getting the night pictures right. I bought this for a trip to Vegas and my friend and I just loved it. It was simple to use which made getting other people to take pictures of us easy. I agree with an earlier review that said it does seem light and cheap. However, I dropped the camera from a height of about 3 feet to a concrete floor and it survived with no problems. Besides if it did die in that instance, I didn't pay that much for it. The best advice I read in the earlier reviews was to buy a camera bag and make sure you have extra batteries. There is very little warning the batteries are about to die. Also, I would get a digital card to take extra pictures.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with the camera and I take pictures all the time now.  I definately recommend this camera as a beginner camera or if you just don't want to or have a lot of money to spend.","I am so happy that I waited for this camera. I bought my daughter a Vivitar before Christmas and she likes it a lot. Then I decided that I wanted a camera as well and researched. I liked what I read about the Kodak. I really like the black and white/sepia/color options. I love black and white photography and it is so nice to be able to switch back and forth.<br /><br />The camera is so easy to use. I popped in the batteries and started shooting (to the annoyance of my kids)<br /><br />The software was easy to download and understand.<br /><br />I already uploaded some pictures and have sent them to friends.<br /><br />I read somewhere that the camera feels light and cheap....I couldnt disagree more. It feels great in my hand.<br /><br /><br /><br />The only two points I could make that aren't great....the shutter speed seems a bit slow. Maybe all digital cameras are this way? I wouldnt know but it seems to be a while from the push of the button till the flash. Kind of hard when you are trying to capture a 14 month old!<br /><br />The other item is the lack of pouch or bag for the camera. My daughter's came with a small bag.<br /><br />I will have to pick one up when I purchase a memory card.<br /><br />The camera will hold 17 regular pictures in it's internal memory.<br /><br /><br />","This camera is wonderful! This is my first Digital Camera and I am pleased with the features and quality of the pictures. Great camera to capture memories and special events! I love this camera! It's the best ever! If you are looking for a Digital Camera this is a good one to choose.","I got this camera as a christmas present along with the dock, this is the coolest thing ever.  For the price you get great results! thumbs up to the Kodak corp. for this great, inexpensive digital camera.","What a wonderful camera. My first digital camera, works wonderful. Pictures are breath taking. When looking through the digital viewfinder the quality is not the best(6/10), but when you snap the picture it's great(9/10). I have only used it indoors so I don't know outdoor quality. Please buy alot of batteries!! It is now 1:20PM I have been using it since Midnight and Im on my thrid pack(2xAA) of batteries!! It eats them quickly I have taken about 50 pictures(highest quality) and 40secs of video. This camera is so simple and none of the features have been left out of it. Kodak's Photoshare software is wonderful, and easy to use. Besides battery life this camera is a 4/5. Wonderful for the expert or first time user.","u kno wat? i have not even purchesed this yet. i was wondering if i should. please e-mail me back at nick_b@rock.com . ok? thank you","My previous (and first) digital camera was a Kodak, which served me well...thus I was inclined to purchase Kodak a second time. I do not quite regret the purchase totally...I was indeed on a budget AND in a rush to get a replacement device, so I was willing to make some leeway in features.<br /><br />The camera is a 3.2MP offering under $150, which is quite competitive. It also has capability at night, something I really wanted in a camera. The one caveat about this camera is it's speed...it's slow, you gotta wait a beat before the camera or subject moves from position. This is a bit annoying for those fun candid shots of friends that you could *ahem* accidentally send to your address book on purpose. That's pretty much the reason I rate it at three stars.<br /><br />Glad I got that night mode though.","This is a great camera for the price. Very easy to use, the included software is very complete.Perfect to email pictures.The red eye problem happens even with expensive cameras.I have not had that problem using the flash.I find that the pic look best if it is dark, inside for example.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera to anyone.","For its price, this is a nice, simple little camera.  Compared to a higher priced digital camera that I have used, the night time feature on this camera produces grainy pictures.  My main complaint is how fast it goes through batteries.  Be prepared to either spend a small fortune on disposable batteries, purchase no less than two pairs of rechargeable batteries, or at the very least, buy stock in Energizer.  I found that it likes only fresh batteries, so don't expect the camera to operate when you steal the AA's out of the remote control.  When the camera does use whatever juice from fresh pair of AA's you swear you just put in, save them for other things like toys, flashlights, remote controls, etc.","The quality of the pictures is good.  The interface is really easy for a beginner to learn.  However, there are two significant drawbacks to this camera.<br /><br />First:  The camera feels like a toy -- it's extremely light and has a plastic body.  I bought this as a gift for my mother (a total beginner) and while she was grateful, even she could tell that this felt \"different\" than the digital cameras we all had.  It felt more like a child's toy -- similar to what you'd expect a Barbie Doll camera for an 8-year old to feel like.<br /><br />Second:  The viewscreen quality is very poor.  When my mother took a picture, she looked at it and asked \"is that what the picture looks like?\"  It was very grainy on the viewscreen -- though it was fine once we uploaded it. I would compare the quality of the viewscreen to what you see on camera phones.<br /><br />In total:  The quality you actually get when you upload is a great bargain for the price.  However, the quality of the camera body and the viewscreen is truly terrible.  That might be ok for some people who care about the final image only.  However, since I bought this as a gift, I now regret this purchase.  I can deal with entry-level etc. I'm not bothered by no optical zoom -- my mother didn't need that. But when the camera itself just feels and looks \"cheap\" it's a problem.<br /><br />Understand these two limitations in your purchase decision.  I would not give this as a gift, as the gift reciever will notice immediately that the camera is far inferior to the cameras s/he has seen other people using.","I bought this for my 8 year old. (very responsible 8 year old)She graduated from instant and advantix brands and constantly wanted to borrow my sony cybershot....This camera is very easy, point and shoot. Great for a digital beginner. Pictures are great. Everything is auto. You will definitely need a regargeable battery pack. Close ups and \"nearer\" shots only...don't expect to zoom....like I said..for the beginner, or the untechnical that want a good camera.","I wanted a simple digital camera that, if it broke, I wouldn't care so much.  This is better than I expected.  It has only a digital zoom, but I knew that when I bought it.  What I couldn;t have known is that the battery life isn't that great -- maybe one hour of time with fresh batteries.  Bring more batteries with you wherever you go.<br /><br />One big plus is that Windows XP sees the camera without any additional software needed.  You can install the Kodak software if you want, but you dont need to. You can just move pictures back and forth between computer and camera like they are files.  This is perfect.  If you still use windows98 I doubt the camera will work this easily.","I started out with an HP digital camera, this one puts it to shame.  Takes great pictures, zooms works, software that comes with it is easy to use.<br /><br />Bought another one for my son and daughterinlaw for christmas.<br /><br />EASY to use....<br /><br />GREAT.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />mbwells - Dresser, WI","If you really want a good digital camera, you need to go and get one with more MP.  the more MP the better the camera.  Other than that, the camera is nice, just not advanced like a lot of other cameras.  That is only my opinion though.  I like to have other features on mine, unlike this one.  if you ever want to buy a digital camera, I also recomend going to a store like Best Buy (or another store like that, not wlmart or anything).  That way you can have an on hands feel of the camera.  go to the store before buying.  they will even show you how to use the camera.  that is your best bet.  don't order on line.  it took me about 2-3 trips to look at cameras before i bought one.  it's something to invest in, so get a good one!","The Kodak CX7300 was a steal at $100. I have wanted a digital camera for a while but did not have the money to shell out for one, but I read the reviews and they are all true. For this price you could not find a better camera for beginners or casual users. It is extremely easy to figure out, and after about 30 min-1hour I had mastered my new toy. Battery life seems to be reasonable up to this point and that is great because I plan on using this thing quite frequently. You can take pics in color, black and white or sepia, all giving a good picture quality. I havent bought a memory card yet, but on the lowest quality setting you can snap 67 pics using the internal memory. Using the best quality it can hold 17 pics. I have made some pretty good pics so far even on the lowest setting. There is a night mode with flash for what else but night pics, and the auto setting is for general picure taking with the flash automatically flashing when there isnt enough light in the room. The 1.6 inch lcd screen is cool, giving you the option to review and keep or delete the pics that you take. The camera even has a movie mode where you can take a very small movie clip (without sound). Included with the package is the software you will need to organize and edit your pics on your computer as well as a tutorial to teach you everything you wanted to know about the Kodak CX7300. This camera is so user-friendly though that chances are you will skip the tutorial and be snapping pics very soon after you buy it. So that is all I can say about this camera. It is a great bargain yet high quality product that I would highly recommend to anyone looking to start digital camera-ing that doesnt have a whole lot of money to get it started. I sure am glad I bought one.","I bought this camera because this one is very cheap instead of others, when the camera arrival I took a picture and I love it. However, there is a tiny problem, when you use a night mode shoots, it is very sensible to movement, so there is a lot of photos shot at that mode and the result was not good. But now I took night photos in normal mode, and they look great.","This is the first digital camera that I have ever owned.  I'll be honest in saying that I was a little uncertain of how to react to this camera when I ordered it from Dell.  Once I received it, however, I came to love the CX7300 very quickly.  It is so easy to use.  Just point and shoot whatever you feel like.  Turn it to auto mode so that it automatically adjusts to get just the right brightness and color.  Use night mode for good shots after dark.  The video mode is also handy, though I purchased this camera primarily for still shots.<br /><br />My first major test for the CX7300 was the final game of the regular season for the Houston Astros.  I was seated along the third base line.  The zoom feature allowed me to get decent shots of the players, especially third baseman Morgan Ensberg and the scoreboard in front of the Crawford Boxes at Minute Maid Park.  Players on second base and beyond became harder to distinguish, but the camera did a great job as far as I'm concerned.  The Astros won the game, as well as the NL Wild Card to make it into the playoffs.  Naturally there was confetti, fireworks, and all-out celebration everywhere in the park.  The camera picked up all of this quite easily.  I probably looked like some kind of freak taking pictures of the confetti, but it was just one other way for the CX7300 to prove its flexibility of use.  Exterior shots of Minute Maid Park came out great.  I even managed to get a shot of one of Houston's finest astride his police horse.<br /><br />I plan on using this camera on any and every trip that I go on in the future.  It's small size, brilliant photo-taking ability and overall ease of use makes it the perfect fit for a roadtrip, ballgame, birthday party, etc.  I highly recommend it for the beginner like myself.  As good as this camera is, Kodak is definitely going to be the first company I look at when it's time to upgrade to a fancier camera.","Hi, I bought the camera 30 days ago. I have taken more than 150 pictures and batteries are OK. Using the internal memory (16MB) the camera allows you to take up to 67 pictures in low resolution and up to 17 in max resolution (you can choose among 4 options of resolutions). However, I don't think the difference is too high. So I always use it in the low resolution. I have also bought a digital flash card of 256MB (SD256M), for $35, and now it allows me to take 306 pics in max resolution and 1184 in low resolution. It is nice. The only problem I see, is that it doesn't record sounds in video recording. Just images (15 secs). Camera is light, works well, and it is all that I expect from a camera. I have had no surprises.","I purchased this camera to replace a Kodak I had prior.  Two items I miss are.  Sound with the video clips....and zoom.  I wish I had gotten the camera with these two additional features listed above.  I miss have those features.","I LOVE THIS CAMERA BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO USE AND IT TAKES GREAT PICTURES IF I WAS TO RECOMMEND A DIGITAL CAMERA TO ANYONE I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING A KOADK EASYSHARE CX7300 IT TAKES GREAT PICTURES.","I have a ton of space since I bought the card ( this one: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005UEA6/102-6745742-3976939?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance )for more space. This camera is easy & it's a nice & clear picture. I reccomend this camera for a family with children :O)","I have never used a digital camera before and bought this one based on the reviews I have read. Within 15 minutes of buying the camera I was taking photos and was able to e-mail them with no problem. The software is easy to install and easy to use. Perfect for beginners. The photo quality is surprisingly good for the price of the camera. The only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because there is no protective lens cover. Other reviewers have also mentioned this, and it is the only complaint I have. I suggest buying a camera bag if you are going to be taking this camera anywhere. Overall, it is an excellent buy, great deal for the money and very easy to use.","This is my third digital camera in the past 2 weeks. The first one was an Aiptek, but that felt so flimsy that I was sure it wouldn't last 2 days. The second was an HP, which guzzled batteries like they were going out of fashion. This, being the third, works like a charm. I am using the batteries that came along with the camera for the past 3 days, and so far, no signs of dying!! The software is just superb. For about $100, this camera is a steal! The picture quality is as good as HP, maybe even better! The camera feels strudy, the controls are easy to use and the menus very simple. Whats more, Kodak gives a one-year limited warranty. (HP gave only a 3 month warranty!)","The CX7300 is the third Kodak camera I have owned, and thus far it has been the best.  The price is great and the camera is very easy to use with a lot of great options.  The Kodak EasyShare Software is some of the best photo software on the market. The camera takes high quality pictures for only being 3.2 mp.<br />I only had a few issues with the camera.  My main problem is that there is no cover for the lens.  Even with the camera turned off you can touch the plastic lens covering.  The second problem I had is that there is also no cover for the connection port on the bottom of the camera.  You have to get a case for this camera if you are going to take it outdoors with you in order to avoid dirt, damage and other problems with both parts of the camera.","I bought this camera at best buy and you cant write reviews on their site. I thought I simply must tell people about this camera. It Is SOOOOOOOOOOO easy to use and you can get high quality prints too. I thought the picture quality was amazing. I would reccomend you buy this camera at best but though. When you put it in your cart at bestbuy.com it is only $116 and next day shipping is $6.15!! The video quality was pretty good too but you can only record for 30 seconds and it has no sound. But who buys a digital camera to shoot videos anyway? I say if you want an excellent camera for a low price you should buy this one.","As previous reviewers noted, this camera takes great outdoor pictures!  You can view photos taken with the CX7300 at my moblog at [...]  Very colorful...  A must buy for those looking to make the move from 35mm to digital!","The pictures come out great, battery life is average, only downside is movies are a little grainy, but then again it was designed to take pics, not movies!","My husband has a digital camera and it was not as simply to use unlike this one. My husband decided to buy this one for me as an anniversary gift since I love to take pictures.<br /><br /> It is easy to follow, step by step instructions. With the auto focus and flash, all my pictures have come out great. I am very, very, happy with this camera.<br /><br /> The software that comes with the camera is also easy to follow. Even a beginner can use it. I guess my Minolta i will be put on top of the shelf.","For its price, this camera is great for outdoor pictures. I took this on a recent vacation to Hawaii, and got some great shots in the mountains and beach as well as undersea (in a submarine, of course !). I have them as my wallpaper now and look cool !  Indoor and night pictures turned out to be quite grainy with chromatic and grain noise, which need manual adjustment using Neat Image or other denoising software (a good free one is at [...] ).<br />There are not many features, just basic delete,digital zoom, flash settings, video (without sound but quality is OK) and exposure setting. However, you can improve the pictures using gamma correction etc. after downloading to the PC (use free Irfanview or Photoshop) . The LCD quality is just good enough to review the pictures, not great like the >$200 models. If you are on a tight budget this is a good choice.","this is the best camera for the price.  yOU CAN'T GO WRONG!","This is my first digital camera and I am in love with it. It's very easy to use straight out of the box. The picture quality is great. The editing software makes it easy to edit pictures and share with friends. A great digital camera for beginners.","The Kodak Easyshare CX7300 is a great camera. The picture quality is great and the camera is very easy to use. It is very easy to get started as they walk you through all the steps. The software is also very easy to use. You can easily blow pictures up without major loss of quality even at 8x10in. If you use the zoom (digital) the quality drops quickly.<br />  It does eat up batteries quickly so I recomend a battery charger but that is usual with digital cameras. The movie mode is also pretty good. The movie size is small (only 320x240) but it is a great for catching those special moments.<br />  My only complaint is that the camera does not come with a lens cover so extra care must be taken.<br />  The CX7300 is a great camera for it's price and is very user-friendly. It is great for digital camera beginners.","I have a Sony Digital Camera that I love but my husband, who is sort of camera illiterate, wanted to use it often so I bought him an easy one of his own -- Kodak Easy Share CX 7300.  While I had to set up the computer portion of it for him, he was taking pictures within a few minutes.  The software is wonderful and easy to use as well.  Everything is explained on the computer monitor.  No need to read through the manual.  I do not have a dock but the cable is very easy to use.  We just love the camera!!!","I ordered this on a grudge Monday PM (1st online buy), after a hideous visit to a local retailer who apparently didn't need my business...I was taking photos with it 3 days later.  This camera is great, feels high quality, and is very easy to get used to.  Only gripe: just noticed the price went down $10 today! (but the free shipping helps there; promised 5-9 days, actually here in 3).  I was crazy to wait this long to do this: both the camera and Amazon impressed me (and no, I'm not a stockholder in either!)","Ok, this camera does not have an optical zoom, but for general point and shoot pictures this may actually be an advantage.<br />All you have to do with this camera is turn it on and it's ready to go.<br />The controls for this camera are very easy to use, and it has several advanced features, like auto white balance and night shot mode.<br />Best of all, this camera takes outstanding pictures.  It rivals any small 35MM for picture quality, and the Kodak software works really well for both filing and printing.<br />I bought this camera as a kind of second camera for Spring break, but wound up using it more than my \"main\" camera because it is so easy to use."]},{"name":"Kodak EasyShare CX7430","amazon_reviews":["Love this camera.

It's the best digital camera ever. I am upset with the fact that Kodak no longer sells  the original batteries that are usable with their original charger that was sold with this camera. Batteries of another kind can be bought and used but they don't charge on the original charger because the batteries are too long or too wide to fit the chargers chamber; even with this... the camera is the best digital camera available. In my opinion anyone who gets a Kodak EasyShare CX7430 will never be satisfied with any other camera.","Have used a similar camera in my work for years. Then the light sensor went bad.  I was so glad to find a good working replacement that I didn't have to spend hours learning how to use and, in my work I need the eye piece to aim shots. The aim and shoot with the screens are useless in the sun.","Older camera but has a view finder , great for use in bright sunlight. Loaned my old one to the granddaughter but she wouldn't give it back ;-)","The best point and shot camra aver i now own a canon t3 and to say i like it<br />in one word no surry if you can find a 7430 in mint for under 35.00 by it make sur it comes. with the cables to hok up to your and cunputer and","Liked It","I love this camera.  Simple for the simple minded photographer.  If you just want family pictures this is perfect.  Easy to use.","It works as advertised: Easy to use without knowing what I am doing. For example, I used it to get my landlord to return my security deposit. They paid up when I told them I had 60 photos showing how clean I left the Apartment.","I bought the CX7430 in 2006 as a Christmas present for my now-deceased husband. He wanted something that was high quality and yet, not expensive. A friend recommended this camera. He LOVED it. Now I use it constantly and LOVE it,too. Click the pic, put the USB into the camera and computer and the pics are automatically transferred. Definitely NOT rocket science. The only difference I see between mine and this newer one is the type of battery used. Mine requires a CRV3,which is available for less than ten dollars at Walmart or 17.88 for the dual pak,as compared to the dual pak shown for almost twice the price. However, I am recommending it to a dear friend who recemtly saw mine!","Lovin this camera. For the price it cannot be beat. I am using it on ghost hunts and the micriphone, camera and video camera is an awesome combo for what i do.","I have had a camera exactly like the one I ordered. The first one was the best. Used just regular alkaline rechargeable batteries and was very reliable. I was never conscious of trying to not use this not use that. Take the batteries out when not using the camera, not use the large view finder because it would drain the battery down. The only reason I needed to replace the one I had for 6 years was because a color sensor went out on it and pictures were pink!  So I ordered another one Just like the one I had and it is so picky about the batteries I use in it. I have had to buy several batteries trying to find one that will last a bit longer. I can't use it like the other cameral because it uses up the battery life. I now have the lithium battery that is recommended for this camera in the manual. So far it is allowing the camera to work when I need it. But why is it so different from my other one that is the exact same make model, year? Go figure. It is too complicated to try and find another camera like this that I would like. The others have draw-backs as well.","It was missing the software to download on my computer. I'll need to buy the rechargeable batteries and ink.  So we'll see how it works.","My daughter bought us this camera for Christmas I don't now how many years ago, and it is my all-time favorite!  We went to Alaska with friends that had very expensive cameras and considered themselves pretty good photographers, and they wanted copies of OUR pix taken on the 'little Kodak camera\":)  Also it is one of the cheapest (price wise) cameras with an actual viewfinder.  That is why my pix are so good; I can actually compose the picture not like on our more expensive camera which has no view finder, only the screen which is so hard to use for composition because of the reflective light.  They are actually making light-blocking sleeves for the screen-only cameras--maybe someone will figure out they need to make affordable cameras WITH viewfinders........................","I love, Love, LOVE my little camera!!  It is HUGE by comparison to cameras \"today\" but I love mine.<br /><br />I never knew the icons on the \"On\" dial because _I_ am a girl who sort of KNOWS how appliances work & just roll with it.  I \"learned\" it took video when my friend took my \"picture\" at lunch for my birthday & the indicator light kept blinking.  \"Huh.  What's that?\"  I looked, she'd clicked the dial the \"wrong\" direction & took a MOOOOOOOOOOVIE of me saying, \"what's blin'......\".  I was elated!!<br /><br />NOW, I might try out the other settings to see what they do!!  I can send videos and photos now.  I love it.<br /><br />My Aunt & Uncle gave it to me when it first came out & it's got wear on it & the doomiflatchy in the battery chamber \"twanged\" off the battery door but I love it!!<br /><br />Huh.  I used \"Love\" 6 times.  Now I AM effusive in my praise most times but THIS is SO genuine!!","I was disappointed because there was no batteries or disc, instructions with the camera.  Guess my expectations were too high.","This camera will make your day.  It takes wonderful quality pics for the not so professional.  Easy operation, quick transfers, and a Great price.  I know I can trust items purchased on Amazon.  I love my little camera.","I have owned two of this particular camera. I am now on my third.  I originally bought my first one, years ago at Sam's Wholesale Club when it first came out.<br />It takes great photos, for a novice point and shoot person.<br /> However, when I went to change the batteries on the first camera that I bought, the battery cover fell apart.  I contacted Kodak to have it repaired but it would have been too costly, more than what I paid for the camera.  I then bought another, online, at Amazon.com.  It arrived and I used it for one year and then that one too, failed. I now have bought another,online, used but \"like new\". The camera arrived yesterday and I am using it to take photos of our \"NEMO\" Blizzard 2013 and it seems to be taking photos in good order.  I am hoping this one will last, for more than a year.","I bought this camera years ago reconditioned. Consumer Reports gave it a \"best buy\" because of it's value and long battery life. The HP camera I had before that ate batteries. We were changing batteries every 30 pictures or so. With the Kodak we could take 250 - 300 pictures on a single set of batteries. I eventually retired the camera to one of our cars where it is useful for pictures while out on the road or in case of an accident. I replaced it with a Cannon that has 6mp and 12X optical zoom.","I bought this camera in August 2004 and yesterday on 08/08/2011 it passed away. Technically, it did not die on its own; I euthanized it after the round dial at the back quit functioning. I am not celebrating its death but rather cherishing the life it had. It lived a healthy, trouble free life of whopping seven years and captured thousands upon thousands of beautiful pictures.<br /><br />Overall, it was a very good, sturdy camera. The picture quality was on par with more recent cameras. The performance was rather amazing for outdoors but just okay under low light conditions. The battery life could have been better. The LCD screen was tiny but hey we are talking 2004 here.<br /><br />RIP CX7430!","I like this camera so much, I bought a used one after mine broke after it was dropped.  The CX7430 was the first digital camera I bought (my 35mm died right before vacation in 2003 and I needed an easy-to-use point-and-shoot). This camera fit the bill....it's easy to use and takes great pictures.  The only issues I've encountered are: (1) battery life is short (but increases if you turn off the LCD screen and use the viewfinder) (2) camera often \"freezes up\" and won't open in cold weather.","My husband bought this camera in 2005 as a replacement for the same model that my son dropped and broke.  Today this camera still works!  I no longer use the printer dock, (just use the SD card to print out photos in the store) and the rechargeable batteries stopped holding a charge in 2007.  I now use AA batteries and they last about two weeks.  This camera is always kept in a soft case when not in use and the picture quality is OK, but with adjustments made with brightness/color before printing them out they look great.  It doesn't take good pictures inside at a distance or with poor lighting, example pictures at my son's school program were awful because I was more than 15 feet away.  I have taken this camera on many vacations, including beaches and no sand in the lens to make it stop working.  It's reliable, if it's not abused and I also like it because it has a viewfinder and the controls are not so small and delicate like the newer digitals.","I have had this camera since 2005. I have taken it on many mountain hikes and it had been dropped on rocks and what not several times and it still worked fine. It has gotten wet several times also. I finally broke it for good when I dropped it from about 15 feet high onto a rock, and it exploded! I went out and got the same model and I will when it finally breaks again. It's my favorite camera ever. The close up mode is really handy too!!","This camera was good for the price but has the last owner's albums, and they can't be deleted, which is funny.<br /><br />I got to use it twice before it broke.","This camera is for my 15 year old. So for her age this camera is good condition, good pictures, nothing cute, cool, or fancy. Quick delivery","The item was used but upon arrival it was like new condition. I was very pleased. I gave it as a Christmas present and my daughter was very pleased  with it. A big Thanks for the great item and reasonable price. I really feel good about this purchase and highly recommend the seller.","Bought if because of review I read elsewhere and I wasn't disappointed!  Easy to use, great pictures and video!  Nice to have the numerous settings for the flash and such but the normal mode is great for almost everything.  Surprised at the good quality of the video for a still camera too!  The only small complaint I have is the size of the LCD screen, but it is a slightly older model so what the heck!  I'm still used to taking pictures the old way by sighting through the eyepiece!","I've had this camera for about 3 yrs now, and it's never given me a single problem.  It takes very good pictures of scenery, but I don't think the night vision mode is particularly great (are any cameras that good @ taking shots in the dark though?).  I've never regretted purchasing this camera.","I love this camera! I've had it for over a year and would recomend it to anyone. I bought this camera after taking a backpacking trip with my friend and seeing the great shots her Easy Share took. I absolutly love it. I often take video of my 9 month old son because I don't have time to whip out the big camera. The video isn't super but it's fast and simple. I just use the Windows Camera Wizard to get all my photos off it so I've never used their software, but I've never had a problem. ::thumbs up::","I bought this camera in April of 2005, and have used it for MANY pictures since (plus some video). I did a lot of research before buying, but really when it came down to it, I bought a brand I knew and it was cheap. Well I ended up with a great camera. I have 6 kids and scrapbook, so photo quality is very important to me and this camera has it. I use rechargeable batteries and they last a LONG time before needing recharged. Take it from a Mom that memories mean a lot to...this is a terrific camera! All of the lengthy good reviews on here are telling the truth. I heard a lot of bad things from \"camera professionals\" about Kodak, but I haven't seen any of what they said.","If I had to be stuck with one camera, this one would be it. I've owned it for a year and it's fantastic! What do you want for $150? This is a steal. It takes better pix than my friend's and family's cameras that are 2-3x more expensive.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. Battery life is unbelievable -- with lithium batteries it takes about 550 shots. Plus it will use rechargable ones as well.<br /><br />2. Pictures are excellent - vivid, colorful, crisp.<br /><br />3. Extremely easy to use.<br /><br />4. Fast at reloading.<br /><br />5. Great price.<br /><br />6. Video feature is great, sound is decent.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. Cannot zoom while video recording.","I bought this camera from amazon.com two years ago and it's been nothing but reliable.  It's simple to use and packed with features - other favorable reviews are dead on - but my story is about its sturdiness.  Today, I accidentally dropped it from a balcony 12 feet high onto concrete paving, and thought it was gone for sure.  One of the prong hinges for the battery door broke, the door itself separated from the camera, and the casing came open on one side.  I was able to pop the casing closed with a screwdriver, and reattach the battery door (half a hinge seems to be sufficient).  The mechanisms and electronics still work *perfectly*.  Optical zoom, automatic lens cover, flash, everything.  It's incredible.","I love this camera, however, the best time to take pictures is during the day with light. The night pictures are pretty dark, but you can still see them. The camera also only takes 2 AA batteries, which makes the camera pretty light.<br /><br />Overall this is a very good digital camera for the price.","I've had this camera for about a year now, and I love it.<br /><br />It's my first digital and I'm amazed at all it can do. It has all the features I could ever want. I just take photos of family get-togethers.<br /><br />After a few months I discovered how to take videos and they are a lark!<br /><br />I paid around $170 for it a year ago and it's a great camera for that price.","i used this camera on 4 european trips and came back with over 300 pics each time without ever needing to change batteries. Person after person marvels at the fantastic shots i took. several have been blown up to 8x10, 5x7 and framed. this is a fantastic unit that meets all my needs. i am not a professional user, but a damn good everyday photo taker. you won't be disapponted with this model. love the dock charger feature also.","This is a great little camera.  It is SO EASY to use.  The photos are great.  I was totally stuck on my 35mm camera until I found this.  35 mm is great but I wanted to be able to preview my photos to make sure I REALLY got the shot.  I also wanted to be able to delete the JUNK without paying to have it printed at the photo shop.<br /><br />I previously owned a first generation digital camera.  The photos were mediocre because of the low megapixels (a big reason why I would not give up the 35mm).  I am extremely happy with the quality of photos from this camera.<br /><br />I also bought the printer dock which recharges the battery.<br /><br />This set works out really great for scrapbooking.  I can easily print off another picture if I need one to fill out a page.  I have even taken the camera and printer to a friends house to scrapbook. I print as I go.<br /><br />I agree others reviews.  I do not care for the software that comes with the camera.  I prefer to use the Windows XP software.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera.  It is easy to use and the pictures are great.  What can I say, I don't think I have used my 35mm since I bought this.  There is no reason to.","I have this camera.  Its very useful to take short movies and the picture clarity is very good.  The USB option make its very easy for transefering the photos on to your PC and delete the pics that you dont like.  The only thing i dislike is that batteries wont last for long.  They would go out say in couple of hours.  Overall the performance is good.","This is my first digital camera EVER!!! And I LOVE it! I've never had a problem with it, ever, it was EXTREMELY SIMPLE and straightforward to learn, I didn't even need the instructions!<br /><br />I love this little camera! I wish I could afford to buy these for my whole family!","Several people in my family have this digital camera, and they have worked for many years. We've taken this camera to the beach, camping, on road trips, to relative's houses; you name it. It has many fine points about it. If you are taking pictures at night, you can flip the stitch on the camera to 'night'; ect. This camera seems durable enough and has a video screen built into it so you can film as well.. (although it only works for a few minutes). Though this camera has several good points, there are bad things about it too, that i should mention. There isn't alot of storage space on it, which means you have to transfer the pictures onto a computer or lap top, which is hard to do if you are on the road or camping or anything like that. Also, the battery runs out easily, and if it is on when you are using it, the front of the camera will stay open, and there is no way to close it until you get another battery. The camera is really nice, and overall, i beleive it deserves four stars. One of our camera's came with a black & red camera case.","I love this camera!! I really like the clear detailed pictures it takes.I always use auto,and its perfect for me.I take tons of family photos.I have taken thounsands of photos with this camera and love them!!Iv never had better pictures.It also has great video too,I have a video camera,but find myself useing this more  for video than my video camer.Because its just so hadny.And I can transfer my videos to cd to watch on tv.I take pictures of my kids sleeping at night,and the room is totaly dark,and when you see the photo youd never know it was takin at night.Because it looks like it was taken during the day,thats how great it lights up the room when you take a photo at night.","after having an ancient 1.3 mega pixel camera since 2000 last october (2004) i decided to buy a newer updated digital. after a bit of searching i settled on the CX7430. at the time it was about $200 which was a great price i love the camera. it has B&W and sepia settings, even though the screen is a bit small the quality is great. also updloading on the computer is simple. great quality fun camera i recommend.","The camera is great no issues with it what so ever, only thing is the internal storage is definitely not sufficient and it's highly recommended that you get a 1 gig or better memory card to go with it.","I love my camera. It has many functions, video, and it is a very nice size. Not too small or too big. It's very great and you can share your pics with others. The picture is so clear it's unreal. I am sure there are better digital cameras out there, but for a person who has never had one and is just getting into picture taking and wants clarity, picture share and even printing from home...this is the one!","I've owned about 10 cameras in my life. My needs are pretty simple. I just want a camera that will make it easy to take a good photo. The CX7430 does just that.<br /><br />The digital camera I was replacing, a Powershot 200, I threw in the garbage, literally. It ate batteries, it seemed to operate randomly, and there was a long, annoying delay before it took the picture so I often \"missed the moment.\" It also was a bit of a pain to figure out how to operate.<br /><br />I've had my CX7430 for about a month, and I love it. The best thing about this camera is that it is very intuitive. I've been able to figure out how to do just about everything by just looking at the camera and using common sense. So far, I haven't had to replace the batteries. It takes the photo promptly. The optical zoom is nice. The quality of the photos looks good.<br /><br />If you are a very serious photographer, you'll probably want a more expensive camera. If you want a simple, inexpensive, intuitive camera that will take nice photos when you want it to, this should be a good choice.","I bought this camera while on vacation to replace my 3.2 megapixel Canon PowerShot A70.  Since then I've taken a few hundred pictures and just don't like the picture quality as much as the camera it replaced.  The pixel count is higher but the overall image quality seems worse.  The auto focus almost always tends to blur just a little, even when the camera is balanced on a stable surface.  I just finished editing pictures I took in Paris and became more and more disappointed at the quality the more I examined the photos for focus and contrast.<br /><br />The one pro I've identified is that the Kodak does take pictures quickly and doesn't have the annoying lag that plagued my Canon.<br /><br />If you are buying this to replace a Canon make sure you're satisfied with the image quality differences before purchasing.","I needed an easy to use camera that would take great pictures, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  This camera meets all of those requirements.  The pictures look great, it is easy to use, and the software that comes with this camera makes it very easy to transfer pictures between the camera and my computer.  The included software also makes it very easy to create online photo albums to share your pictures with friends and family.  I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for an affordable camera that takes great pictures.","The Easy Share line is a great gift, and it eliminates the confusing uploading/downloading/cable-hooks-up-where? for those PC & digital photo newbies. I have purchased 4 of the EasyShare line for gifts for family, friends and myself.","I am new at digital photography, and I was looking for something easy to use, yet a camera that took great pictures.  This absolutely fits the bill!  The way the camera works is similar to any Kodak film-type camera - just point and shoot.  It has the same features my film camera does, in that you frame your subject, depress the shutter button halfway to focus, then shoot. It has an auto setting that is useful for most picture taking, fill-in flash, zoom.  It's extremely easy to review any pictures taken, and delete them immediately or save for later.<br /><br />Not only does it take clear, sharp pictures, but it also has a video feature that was amazing for an inexpensive camera.<br /><br />The instructions contained in the booklet were precise and easy to follow.  Great for beginners.<br /><br />The printer dock is also easy to operate, and is certainly nice to have if you want to print a few pictures here and there at home.  The cost factor is a little high, at approximately $.64 per print, so it would be more cost-effective to have them printed at a drug store, etc.<br /><br />I've loaded the software onto my computer in order to upload the pictures to view and/or print.  I had no problem with the software after loading, and it is very easy to use.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to recommend this model to anyone just learning to use a digital camera, or someone looking to upgrade, for that matter.<br /><br />My next purchase will be a bigger memory card for the video feature I plan on using!","When I got this camera out of the box, I was taking pictures in minutes without even reading the instructions.  Don't get me wrong, I'll have to review the manual to do rapid series shots, night shots, or other shots that might be difficult.  So far, it's been incredibly easy to use and very intuitive.<br /><br />I'll echo the concern of at least one other reviewer - I strongly recommend against installing the Kodak software.  You should have no problem simply connecting the camera to a USB port and transferring images and video.  After installing Kodak's software, my computer crashed.","I just brought this camera a few weeks ago.  I took it on a trip this Memorial weekend and the pictures came out beautiful.  I love the close-up mode and the sports mode the best.  The night mode is also very good (which surprised me).  I also like the fact that this camera allows you to review the pictures and zoom in and out when doing so. I did not like the auto mode at all.  The landscape mode took pretty good pictures.  When I viewed them I thought they weren't good, but when I reviwed them online they were beautiful like postcards.<br /><br />I also like the video capability.  When I first got the camera, I did a little home video walking around the house and talking and when I uploaded it on the computer it was sharp and very clear.  It also played back well on the camera.  This camera is worth the price.  Like the other reviewers I recommend any buyer to purchase rechargeable batteries.","Just got this camera a couple of days ago.<br /><br />photo quality is very good though i would let the camera take a few days time as all the electronics has to break in well and running smoothly,ex-audio systems TV's etc etc,so also cameras.<br /><br />the main thing is the ease of Use and it is so simple to use i just had to refer to the manual twice for a few clarifications,the close mode is good and the kodak lens is as good as any other camera in the market infact slightly better ,as it is showing details which i never saw before in pictures.<br /><br />and amazon customer service is top notch ,got a good new camera at a good price.Be sure to check yur firmware version in the about section it should read 1.01 mine was 1.00 and kodak had the firmware on their site in the CX 7430 support section  ,just log in with a email ID and download the firmware and upgrade all instructions are in perfect clarity.<br /><br />overall kodak is very good and would only buy kodak from now mainly for the color quality","As cameras go, this one is easy to use and takes great pictures.  It has some really nice features too.  But digital cameras are more than just stand-alone devices; you have to connect them to something else to get the pictures off.  That's where I ran into trouble.  It seems the \"Easyshare\" software on the CD with the camera is incompatible with Windows 2000 or XP if they are fully updated.  They suggest that you download new software from their website instead, but to do that you must register, and their website refused to let me do that.  So to share pictures on a camera with \"EasyShare\" in its NAME, I had to eventually go to Microsoft's support site to learn how to uninstall the Windows update that was interfering with Kodak's software.  Now I have to worry about Windows re-installing that update next time I run Windows Update.  Does this seem \"Easy\" to you?<br /><br />In short, do not buy this camera unless you have good computer skills and time to spend.  Shame on Kodak for so blatantly dropping the ball.","I just received my EasyShare camera a couple of weeks ago.  Not only does it zoom, it has moving making capability!  This surprised me.  You can take 33 seconds of video with your EasyShare.  The picture quality is great and the camera is easy to use.  Further, the user documentation is simple to understand!<br /><br />Highly recommended for those of you in the market for a digital camera.","Nothing much to say, after all the good reviews. I've had this camera for 5 months, and took hundreds of pictures and many short video clips. It became my main still camera.<br /><br />I love it.","I can't say enough good things about this camera.  I upgraded to this after owning a very low-end model that took abismal pictures, so I have something to compare it to.<br /><br />The battery life on the 7430 is fantastic, I bought this around Christmas and after a lot of use just changed the batteries for the first time.  The pictures are crystal clear, very high quality.  The flash is very adequate and my indoor nighttime pics look great.<br /><br />The delay of the shutter is very short, which is important to me with a toddler running around.  This was a big problem with my old camera and the 7430 is really fast.<br /><br />The video feature is also great.  It isn't digital camcorder quality of course, but with my 256 card I got some great footage.<br /><br />This camera is also very easy to use and I highly recommend it to anyone.","I bought this for myself for Christmas and after 3 months of playing with it, have decided its a keeper!  It takes great quality pictures, the software is easy to use, and the editing works great.  The red eye removal function works very good - much better than a camera I tried out last Christmas (and returned) Since we don't have a camcorder, we love the movies with sound.<br /><br />I do not use the share function, since I usually crop or enhance or something to make the pic \"perfect\".  I also do not print at home - way too expensive compared to printing at York, Sam's, or even Eckerds!<br /><br />One small complaint - the default in the Kodak software is to save pictures at a lower res after editing.  This makes no sense to me.  If you liked a picture well enough to edit it, why would you want to save it at a lower quality???  This is easy to change, but anytime you upgrade the software, defaults to this again, and you have to remember to change it.<br /><br />Second Con is the date imprint.  I chose this camera because I specifically wanted date imprint (without having to use software to add the date).  The date imprint is HUGE and yellow - very unsightly.<br /><br />I haven't had anything bigger than 4x6 printed, so I definitely want to try that soon to see the quality.","I just got this camera and it is great!!!<br /><br />the pictures come out with so much detail and color!!!<br /><br />And the pictures upload to the computer so fast!!!<br /><br />The only things are is that it only has a little bit of memory, and you cant take more then 30 pics,<br /><br />so you should get a memory card,<br /><br />and also battery life isnt so long, but otherwise its great!!!<br /><br />I highly recomend it.","I got this camera as a replacement after losing a 3.2 Kodak...<br /><br />I am very happy with this camera, which I received as a gift. I have own two digital cameras in the past and this is the best by far.<br /><br />The only minus is that the zoom is difficult to use and you must hold the camera very steady.<br /><br />Pluses...<br /><br />Battery seems to last longer than most<br /><br />Picture quality is fantastic. I have blown many up and they look great<br /><br />You get nice short video with audio and you can hear the playback well<br /><br />Works well indoors and outdoors<br /><br />Very easy to use<br /><br />Easy to download pictures<br /><br />Great for enlargements<br /><br />Who ever designed this camera did an excellent job. It is so easy to use and the pictures are of excellent quality.","Kodak CX7430 Purchased: June 2004, used frequently<br /><br />MOST NOTABLE FEATURE: 640x480 VIDEO+AUDIO CAPABILITY (NO TIME LIMIT)<br />1) Using ordinary 1800mah NiMH rechargeable AA batteries, I have been able to take video  with audio at the highest quality setting for over 55 minutes (until my memory card ran  out) with the LCD screen TURNED ON the entire time, and the low battery indicator didn't even appear!<br />2) 1GB SD cards have fallen swiftly in price and are a great addition to this camera.  My  1GB Lexar SD card can record over 55 minutes of video with audio at high quality (640 by  480 pixels, 13 frames per second), and 80 minutes at medium quality (320 by 240 pixels,  20 frames per second; max time limit is 80 minutes for this setting).  A 512MB SD card  can record for just over 28 minutes straight (highest setting), and a 256MB SD card for slightly over 13  minutes.<br />3) Most digital cameras offer video capability, but limit your filming time to 30 seconds  or 3 minutes per video in most cases.  Those that don't limit filming time usually  provide resolution nowhere as good as the CX7430's high-quality video. (Update: Canon's SD-series cameras are a major exception. Note that you will pay much more [except for the SD110] and that you will only get about 15-25 minutes of 640x480 15fps video/audio out of a 1GB SD card.  The SD300's [4MP] picture quality is about the same as the Kodak CX7430's.)<br />4) The camera is highly competitively priced even when compared to dedicated digital  video camcorders that use memory cards rather than tapes or DVDs.  Both resolution and  frame rate are comparable to or even better than the \"digital tapeless\" camcorders I have  looked at on amazon (as of October 2004), and given its still photo capability the CX7430 is bargain-priced.  Anyone considering buying a digital tapeless camcorder should definitely consider this  camera when deciding on their purchase.<br />- NOTE: Videos are recorded in QUICKTIME format.<br /><br />PRO's:<br />1) Great video capability as described above.  The camera's microphone is excellent--I've  recorded videos in both quiet environments and an extremely loud dance club and the  camera adapted perfectly to both situations--no static or undesirable anomalies (though  it did not pick up much of the bass in the club, if that matters).  I've even used the  camera several times to record audio from my grad classes (camera simply pointed at the  ceiling, medium quality video setting; I extract the audio from the file for listening).<br />2) Takes excellent close-up photos.<br />3) Photos overall are very satisfactory.<br />4) Compact enough to fit in an ordinary front pocket.  Pretty typical size and weight for  its class.<br />5) The LCD screen is very bright and fine for use in all but very strong direct sunlight,  where the LCD image gets slightly harder to see.<br />6) Interface is excellent.  Buttons are responsive and the mode dial is very very  convenient.<br />7) Good start-up time, about 3 seconds and you are ready to shoot.<br />8) 3X zoom.  Perfectly satisfactory; once you start going over 4X zoom you need a tripod  to take decent photos.<br />9) Small speaker to hear the audio when you play back your videos.<br />10) Extraordinary Battery  Life (see above).<br />11) Sturdy design.  Another reviewer complained about the casing being easily scratched;  I have used my camera for about 7 months now and it doesn't look a whole lot different  from when I bought it.  The casing/finish seems pretty normal for this type of camera.<br />12) Decent variety of manual options, but not enough for amatuer photography (there is no true \"manual\" setting).<br />13) Good file compression!  I have seen cameras produce pictures of about the same  quality (or even worse) as the CX7430 and wind up with file sizes of 1MB or more per  photo.  Average file size for the CX7430 ranges from 300KB to 750KB depending on the  quality setting and content.<br />14) Fairly quick autofocus--just under one second from the time you press the picture button while the camera is pointed at an unfocused subject until the shutter closes and the picture is taken.  If the subject is already in focus the picture is taken almost instantaneously.<br /><br />CON's:<br />1) Pictures are easily blurred in some environments.  See Taking Photos section below.<br />2) Several of the provided 7 photo settings on the dial are not worth using.<br />3) No case provided.<br />4) Videos taken in the camera's high-quality setting suffer from a very low frame rate  (13fps), and the image blurs badly when you move the camera around quickly in softly-lit indoor environments.  That said, the video capability is still remarkable for  a camera of this type (and at this price).<br />5) The door covering the SD card slot and the data port is sturdy but doesn't latch very  strongly.<br />6) Zoom cannot be adjusted while taking video. You need to adjust zoom first, then start  filming.  Focus also does not adjust during filming, but it's not a factor unless you  begin filming a landscape and then try to take close-up video without starting a new  video file.<br /><br />Taking Photos:<br />Overall, I think the CX7430 takes pictures pretty typical of a 4MP camera (they look  about the same as pictures taken by a friend's Casio Elixim(?) 4MP camera), in terms of both its ability to focus properly and the quality of the photos produced.<br />- Close up photos are a strong point of this camera.  I use it to make photo \"scans\" of  important documents.<br />- Ignore the landscape, night (unless you have a tripod), and portrait settings.  I  haven't been to any sports events or anything similar so I haven't used the sport  setting.  Given the slightly blurred pictures I've gotten at football games from cameras set on Auto, this setting might be useful.<br />- The best pictures this camera takes are: close-ups; outdoor, well-lit environments; and  photos (indoor or outdoor) where the flash has been used effectively, i.e., slightly dim  environments with the subject no more than say 20 feet away depending on the lighting.<br />- I have not found any major problems with exposure or color-balance in the CX7430's  pictures.  If you want to take a picture of a sunset, however, focus the camera somewhere  else first, then take the picture, otherwise the camera automatically adjusts to dilute the color of the sky (i.e., deep orange-pink becomes very light pink).<br />- Pictures taken indoors in low to medium lighting *without flash* bear a strong chance of blurring unless taken by very very steady hands.  Pictures taken indoors outside the range of the flash (say, distance of 25 feet or more) are pretty much guaranteed to be blurred to a significant degree unless the environment is extremely well lit.<br />- Picture quality decreases significantly in darker environments, but this is typical of  most cameras.<br />- Two-star quality photos are fine for almost all situations.  Photo dimensions increase  at the three-star setting but quality is not a whole lot better.<br /><br />Other recommendations:<br />- Buy rechargeable batteries, they are a must for any digital camera.  I suggest 1800mah  (milli-amp hours) NiMH (Nickel-Metal-Hydride) rechargeables.  The batteries will pay for  themselves very very quickly.<br />- Some reviewers have liked the software included with the camera, but I usually avoid  proprietary software--my understanding is that Kodak software especially is loaded with  spyware/adware--and I personally have never used the software that came with the CX7430.  To transfer photos, the \"Microsoft Scanner and Camera Wizard\" included with Windows XP  has been more than adequate.  (It should appear automatically when you connect the camera  to your computer.  If not, go to My Computer, look for the camera icon, and right click  on it, then choose \"Get pictures.\"  It can also be accessed if you are using a card  reader: go to My Computer, right click on the removeable drive, and choose \"Autoplay,\"  then find the wizard in the list.)  The wizard lets you pick a name for the folder it  will create for your photos under My Pictures, and names all of the photos and videos  after the folder.  I am surprised by the number of my friends who still do not use this  simple, clean utility.  Windows' Picture and Fax Viewer works fine for viewing photos.  Editing, of course, is another matter.<br />- Buy a large memory card to take advantage of the camera's video features.  I have  gotten hours of priceless video of my friends and I studying in China.  There are  definitely times when still pictures just won't cut it, and even if you don't get a large  memory card you will appreciate the ability to take a short clip every now and then.  Memory prices have plummeted over the past year and a large card is definitely a worthy  investment.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />I highly recommend the Kodak CX7430.  It's not a top-of-the-line model, but for those  with modest photo and video needs, this is a superb value for the price.","I've photographed weddings and like to play with special features on my cameras.  This unit has enough gadgets to impress me.  I am also impressed by it's workmanship.<br /><br />My wife likes to just point and shoot.  She is a teacher and likes to keep the docking printer in her classroom.  The camera is simple enough for her needs, yet has a better quality picture than some of the other cheaper models we looked at.<br /><br />I looked a long time for a low cost easy to use camera with more advanced features than normal.  I'm not sorry I chose this one.","I can not say enough good things about this camera.  Period.  There are not enough good descriptive words to even begin to express how fabulous it really is.  I bought this after dropping and breaking my Sony Cybershot (which I hated anyway, the macro function was a joke).<br /><br />I will guard this camera with my life.  The pictures are PERFECT.  The features, of which there are many, are so simple to operate that a llama could figure it out.  I am a picture taking fanatic and I am heavy into scrapbooking... this camera captures perfect shots of my son AND our outings/vacations.  I have not been disappointed with a single picture yet (unless my poor framing was to blame).<br /><br />The thing that impressed me the most is the almost non-existent delay when using the flash.  I had missed MANY a spontaneous shot with my Sony because of the ridiculous flash delay, but never again!  Rapid speed picture taking is almost flawless, and the Sports function captures subjects in motion beautifully.<br /><br />The macro function is outstanding and EASY.  My close-up photos are breathtaking, and I am in awe that this camera performs so easily and wonderfully.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/05 - I had posted a website in this review which DOES NOT SELL ANYTHING - they simply give unbiased reviews of any digital camera you can imagine.  I recommend reading their review of this camera, as it was my deciding factor after months of research.  Amazon, however, removed the link I provided, because they are weird.  The website is w w w DOT steves-digicams DOT c o m.<br /><br />I am in no way affiliated with the website, but I have used it extensively while camera hunting these past few months.  I bought my Kodak based on this review, and I am so glad I did.  You won't be disappointed!<br /><br />I do recommend checking out a charging or printer dock.  I have written a review of the printer dock, please check it out for my thoughts on it's performance.  :)","I got this camera for christmas and couldnt be happier. Its so easy!!!!! and the picture quality is great. I would recommend this camera over and over.<br /><br />~Stacey","This camera is great for my needs. I needed a camera which makes good 8 X 10's and this one does. I wanted to take some sound movies and this one takes 20 FPS videos. I tried the Kodak 5 mp camera, but it's movies would only work at 15 FPS, and it was a big noticable difference, so I took it back. Yes, it does have a tendency to overexpose, but it's no big deal for me to tweak the exposure. For the price, under 200, it's a real deal. The software is good too, and you don't need Kodak's overpriced dock..just the USB and their Easy Share CD.","I have recently become interested in digital photography. This camera is great for people who are starting out a photography hobby, or want a simple camera to use. The camera has a lot of features, but is still easy to use. By setting it on \"auto\" the camera does all the work for you. But you still have a lot of options. You can change the flash setting, white balance, ISO speed, etc all in an easy to navigate menu. The pictures look great. While there might be digital cameras out there that take better pictures, none are as cheap and have as many features. The Easyshare software that comes with the camera is the only thing that is lacking. It makes it easy to e-mail your pictures (which is what it is designed for, I suppose) and simple editing techniques are also available. But there is no option for more advanced editing, even resizing a picture is not available. It is also difficult to organize the pictures in their respective folders, you are forced to do it within the program if you want to continue to access them in the easyshare program. Despite this downfall, I think this camera is a great buy, and would recommend it to anyone.","This is the first digital camera I have ever purchased.  I cannot overstate how easy it is to use this camera and all of the features it offers.<br /><br />Its does not run through batteries, it takes crisp pictures and easily fits in your pocket if you need to carry it on you.<br /><br />I have found that the menu's on the camera make it easy for you to see what you are doing and is not confusing, each mode that you chose gives you a brief description of how you would use each picture mode and makes this camera simple to use.<br /><br />The only interesting thing I have learned from using this camera is with night pictures and by the way it does an excellent job. You have to hold the camera very very still otherwise the night images turn out blurry. I believe the shutter stays open a bit longer during night pictures which would make sense.<br /><br /> If you are unsure of what camera to own stop here and buy this one now belive me you will have no regrets.","I liked a lot of things about this camera--it was easy to figure out--a real plus for a relative novice--, it had good response time on the shutter, quality of pictures was good, and I was able to adjust it for a variety of conditions.  However, it did have a tendency to overexpose shots, especially in full sun outdoors, or when using the flash indoors.  Now, this can be adjusted for--you can go into the \"exposure\" option on the menu and take down the exposure a bit, and that worked well.  I even found that if I underexposed pictures a bit, and then brightened them up when I got them on my computer, I often got better color and detail than the default exposure settings.  So I almost kept it.  But the fatal flaw for me was that, having taken the trouble to get all the menu settings where I wanted them--if I changed the dial setting, or shut the camera off, they were gone.  The settings all reverted automatically to the default, so I'd have to do it all over again ten minutes later to get the next shot.  It was a near thing--but I returned the camera.<br /><br />However, for anyone who isn't quite the control freak I am, this is a good camera at a good price.  I was worried about battery life, but I took well over 100 shots before the digital AA batteries that came with it wore out.  I tossed in a pair of rechargeable AAs, and took maybe 150 more, and they hadn't run down when I decided to return it.  Of course, I don't use the LCD as my viewfinder, which helps extend battery life a lot.  On the other hand, I did spend quite a lot of time reviewing pictures on the LCD, and even took some videos just for fun, so considering how Consumer Reports rated Kodak cameras on battery relative to other digital cameras, I was quite pleased.","I've had my CX7430 for over 2 years now and have enjoyed this camera thoroughly. The camera has great zoom capabilities and can get you close to the subject you want to photograph. The battery life is very decent, even when the LCD display is being used. The pictures themselves (when left on Auto mode) are super - the colors and clarity are excellent. I've received very positive feedback about the clarity of the pictures. The memory cards are inexpensive too, especially if you don't buy the Kodak brand of SD cards. The camera is preloaded for only 10 pictures and comes with a nonrechargable battery set, so investing in memory and batteries is a must. My favorite feature is the video capabilities; with my 1GB card (and the camera will accept up to a 2GB card) I can get close to 70 minutes of video, with wonderful audio. The video is recorded in .mov files and are quite impressive. The downsides? Sure, there are a few..  the camera is quite bulky in comparison to almost all other digi cams currently available - it's quite `fat' in size, and the casing is very easily scratched, even with gentle use and care; and night shots taken outside (like fireworks or holiday lights) are pretty terrible - blurry and unusable. Overall I am very impressed with the quality and features of this camera and won't be replacing it for quite some time. The 4MP are more than enough for quality photos, the video is a wonderful bonus and the ease of use is wonderful. Highly recommended.","I got this camera from my company's anniversary draw.  I have been using this for only one week.<br /><br />I actually purchased the Kodak DX7440, which is more expensive and has many more features than this CX7430.  I have compared photos taken from this CX7430 and DX7440, I do not see any difference for most of the photos taken.  Looking at the computer screen, the colors are vivid and true, they are not satuated.  There are lots of details enlarge the photos to their true sizes with photo editor software.<br /><br />However, if you don't know how to do this, don't worry; the Kodak CX7430 comes with a CD which lets you see the photos.  Here are the easy steps:<br /><br />Insert the CD to your computer, install the software.<br /><br />Turn of your camera; connect the USB cable that comes with the camera to both the camera and your computer; then turn on your camera.  The Kodak software automatically detects the photos needed to be transfer and asks if you like to transfer them now; then, you just click \"transfer all photos\".  That easy!!<br /><br />The fast-speed USB cable makes fast transfer of photos and movies taken with your CX7430.  You can view your photos and moview with the Kodak software with sound if it is movie.<br /><br />The movie feature is a very nice touch since there are times when you really want to capture some great moments in motion.  This camera has TV-quality movie features and captures very good movies in detail and with good sound quality.  I use 256 MP secure digital card to store up to 12 minutes of movies in the highest resolution.<br /><br />Taking pictures is in you control.  If you like to take close shots, be sure to switch it to close capture mode otherwise it won't focus well enough.  You can review the pictures in the viewfinder and enlarge it in the viewfinder and see if it is a good one taken.  If not, you can delete it with the delete button.  It is very easy!  Taking night shots is pretty good too.  The flash is enough to light up a room.  I don't have trouble taking night shots with good results.<br /><br />Now, if you want to email pictuere to friends and relatives, the software lets you do it in this simple manner: type in \"from\" email address, type in \"to\" destination email address, select the pictures to be send from the right and click, email them now.  Be sure that you do this while you are online.<br /><br />It also let you email pictures in low resolution for faster transfer (which is only good for viewing), or transfer in original resolution (for if the receiver may want to print the photos as well).<br /><br />I upload photos to Ofoto.com and print 4\"x6\" or 8\"x10\" photos.  I also have a printer dock from Kodak and it laminates the prints so that the photos are free from moisture attack and finger prints.  I love these features very much as it makes the pictures truely longer lasting.<br /><br />The only drawbacks (as with all other digital camera) are that the battery does not last long if you use the viewfinder LCD screen very ofter and the movie length is limited by the memory size of your memory card.  That's why I bought the new 256 MB secure digital card.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a very good camera at an attractive price from Amazon.  I am just lucky that I got it free from my company.  If anyone like to take great photos and like to film movies once in a while, this is it!  It is lighter than a camcorder and smaller so you can carry it around easier, besides it takes much better pictures than many cameras out there including a comparable SONY.  I recommend this great Kodak CX7430.","Pros:<br /><br />- Great price for an outstanding 4MP resolution<br /><br />- Small and light<br /><br />- Easy-to-use menus; lots of dedicated function buttons<br /><br />- Video with sound that's worth keeping!<br /><br />- Portraits generally look outstanding<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Can't remember your flash setting after turning off camera<br /><br />- Images generally overexposed<br /><br />- Trouble taking pictures when zoomed in<br /><br />This is a great camera for the price, yet images can turn out anywhere from outstanding to poor.  Portraits usually look great, with soft, smooth skin tones.  But most images, taken with or without the flash, are highly overexposed.  And when zoomed in (using the optical zoom, not digital), all the pictures turn out blurry.  This happens even in well-lit conditions and when I am holding the camera still.<br /><br />If you are not terribly concerned about the quality of your pictures, this is an excellent camera.  But since I've found that my old 2MP Fuji camera takes better (if grainier) pictures, I'm not likely to shop at Kodak again.","I love my kodak easy share camera. It is a good camera for the price. However, just a warning, if you have a problem with your camera, kodak has very poor customer service and is unwilling to help you fix your problem. You will have to take care of it on your own at a local dealership.","Pros - Light weight, small, handy, good pic quality and lot of flexibility while shooting. User friendly software.<br />Cons - Rechargable battery and charger should come with the package.","I am absolutely delighted with the Kodak CX7430 and wholeheartedly recommend it. Kodak has cornered the market in offering tremendous features for extremely reasonable prices. I upgraded to the CX7430 from the CX7000 because I was so happy with the Kodak line. The CX7430 offers great features, such as both optical and digital zoom, and video capacity with sound, along with an outstanding 4 MPs. The operating system is the simplest and easiest to learn and use of any brand of digital camera. The entire Kodak Easy Share system makes downloading, editing, printing, and e-mailing pictures  a breeze. This is THE 4 MP camera to buy!","Although it lacks a German lens, this unit provided crisp clear close-ups.  Very easy to use for the most part.  Display is bright and menu commands are logically arranged.","We just got this camera. It is a very practical and easy to use camera. It is not bulky and is very light. And the best thing is the software that comes with it is easy to use too. Overall a great deal for the price. If you are looking for quality, ease, and don't want to pay a lot this is definitly your best bet.","I bought this camera and I love it! I checked out just about every camera in the 3 and 4 MP range and this one has the best quality picture and it is one of the easiest to use in the $200-$300 price range. I would recommend any Kodak for its ease of use, but I bought the 4MP (cx7430) so I could crop and enlarge my pictures without loosing photo quality. The 3MP (cx6330) was the other camera that I looked at in depth, but I found that the 8 x 10 pictures were blurry even without cropping.<br /><br />I would also recommend purchasing a 128MB card to store pictures. The internal memory only holds about 9 pictures on the best quality. I purchased the 256MB card, which holds about 190 pictures...way too many pictures, but it was cheaper than the 128MB card when I bought it.<br /><br />Six monthes later...<br /><br />I still love this camera! I have taken photos in every type of lighting imaginable. They all look great. The only thing I need to adjust with the Kodak EasyShare software is the red eye. There is a flash option to get rid of red eye, but I choose not to use it. (It takes longer in between when you press the button and when it actually takes the picture.)<br /><br />My pictures turn out better than my friends pictures, who oddly enough have 5MP cameras. The simple features on the CX7430 camera are great, you can't mess up. By the time one would adjust everything on those more high tech cameras, the moment is over. From the time you turn the CX7430 on, which only takes a couple seconds, you can take pictures that turn out great! The Kodak also takes pictures much faster than a lot of the more expensive cameras. This is something to look into when buying a camera.<br /><br />Another thing is the battery life. The battery life is very, very good for a digital camera. I have rechargeables and they last me a good 150-200 pictures with the screen on.<br /><br />Overall, great camera! I'm glad I bought it!","I've had this camera for few months and have been extremely satisfied with it.  I took one of the best pictures I've ever taken using this camera.<br />It appears that the maximum flash range is less than 12 feet, so you need to keep that in mind when using the flash.","At least one of the problems described by the commentator above may be due to user error.  I am regularly amazed by people who try to use a flash to capture people on stage 50 feet away (or even use flash to attempt to take a picture of a projected film on a screen).  The tiny flashes on ALL portable cameras only work up to about 15 feet away (and if they are close enough to a film screen they'll just wipe it out with white light).<br />So, we shouldn't be surprised that your flash pictures of your cousin turned out dark -- the flash didn't reach him.  And, we shouldn't be surrpised that it was blurry -- when zoomed in, in low light, any autofocus will have trouble tracking and the CCD will barely get enough light to register anything.<br />(I don't have this particular camera so just gave it a middling rating out of ignorance.)"]},{"name":"Kodak DX7630","amazon_reviews":["My favorite camera","Very nice camera, I got it to replace the one I had, so now I have extra parts.","Purchased this to replace my original witch met with an accident on holiday in cornwall it was used but in great condition matter of fact it looks exactly the same as my original no marks or scratches works great I am very pleased with my purchase  Thank you","I was given this camera several years ago by my son who wanted to kickstart me into the digital age.

Six MPs is plenty for the nature pictures that I print.  It is very easy to use. I also own a Canon 40D, a Yashica D Twin Lens Reflex, a Asahi Pentax Spotmatic, a Pentax K110, a Pentax K-1000, a Ricoh KR-5, an a few other cameras.","I really love this camera! I bought it on the advice of a friend, who has had hers for many years. I do a lot of different kinds of artwork, and needed a camera that would capture the details and colors of my as clearly as possible without me having to spend hundreds of dollars. The Kodak Easyshare is the best one I've ever used for this purpose. The pictures come out crystal-clear, even when not using a tripod for stability, and the macro setting is awesome. I can even photograph glitter, which is really hard to capture in a camera image, and zoom in on fine details of my collages or paintings. It is equally great for vacation pics and scenery. If you want a really good camera, but don't have a lot of money to spare on a newer model, then grab one of these while you can.","This camera is very user friendly and easy for the occasional photographer. The order arrived on time and in good shape.","i love this camera!!! it has thru the lens focus and visual. i hate trying to get a good pic by looking at back of camera. has a superb telephoto lens but as a fibre artist i love the macro feature. took photos of Pilated woodpecker the other night. awesome. the first one i bought, was order confusion and so he sent priority at no extra charge. mahalo nui loa on that one. they have awesome customer service also.","I bought a used one, but it works very well like a new one. Additionally, they gave me large capacity of battery.","I didn't get the cables or anything that come with this camera normally. But I knew this was a good value for just the camera itself because I have had this exact model before and its works just like I need. Great camera for fast clear pictures with great color! (Especially when little kids are involved) Guarantee you will love this camera!","ok","I bought this camera with money given to me at Christmas 6 years ago. The price was over $300. I never seem to be in line with technology, because now, camera's in this price range have triple or quadriple the zoom and megapixels. Six years ago, I had a great camera, but even then, the zoom and picture quality didn't fully fit my needs. Outdoor shots (distant/close-up), still shots (indoor/outdoor) - this camera can make good pictures - some even professional quality. But for indoor action/indoor distant, and especially indoor action distant - forget it. I have two young sons and getting shots of them playing sports in a gym does not happen with this camera. Outdoor distant action shots are not good either (because of zoom limitations I suppose). I've tried every setting, and unless I'm missing something, this is a very disappointing feature. So this year I am getting, with much research, a better camera and hoping it will be sufficient for the next 6 years!","It is a very good point and shoot camera with a rugged case and easy to use. I would recomend getting the charging dock for added convenience.","I've had this camera at least five or six years with no problems!  Sorry to hear about some customers having battery latch issues ... I have had none.  This camera takes great pictures, as the following true story illustrates:  About three years ago, my brother and his wife borrowed my DX7630 to take some graduation pictures of their daughter in different indoor and outdoor settings.  After taking several pictures they went to a local Walmart photo studio to have copies made.  Well, at first the Walmart photo rep was hesitant to make copies for them because she said the pictures looked like they were taken at a professional studio and they were not allowed to make copies of them.  The girl actually made them show her the card from the camera to prove they had taken the pictures themselves.  (true story)  I was mighty proud to know that those pictures had been taken from my little Kodak camera!!!","I took a chance and bought this camera because it was very similar to two other Kodak cameras I have had in the past that used the same type of battery and media card. Unfortunately, both of them had been dropped, the auto on/off mechanism was damaged and they didn't work again after that(the last one just recently dropped after working perfectly for almost 5 yrs). They took great pictures and videos. I love the battery life of these cameras, I don't ever plan to buy a camera that uses batteries less than this type.<br /><br />I looked for a camera like this because I needed it in a hurry as I was going on vacation soon and did not have time to learn to use a new camera. I am very pleased to say I am happy with the camera's performance. It handled exactly as the other two cameras and the batteries and media cards I already had worked perfectly . I took several hundred pictures and they came out great ,as they should have, based on the setting used. The videos came out great also.<br />  For a used camera, it is in excellent condition. The price was well worth it.<br />I would recommend a Kodak EasyShare camera with these features to anyone looking for an easy-to-use camera that takes great pictures.","If you can't already tell I love this camera. I am a complete novice so I needed something \"easy\" but still wanted beautiful pictures, of course. I've had this camera for 6 or 7 years and have just one complaint. My battery latch broke also, and that's why I gave it 4 stars. It just broke last year though, so I've lived with it. Because of that, the battery compartment door would come open by itself at times and the battery would fall out. Really inconvenient because then you would have to go through resetting the time and date...etc.<br /><br />I took it on my recent honeymoon to Tahiti and you wouldn't believe the colors it captured. Absolutely amazing for a fairly inexpensive camera.","This came takes good quality pictures and is easy to use.<br /><br />It also works perfectly with the broken latch, so i do not see the reason for complaining about it as much as people do.<br /><br />My latch broke about 2 months ago- by the hands of my husband non the less and he isnt exactly the guy that treats everything with a gentle touch. So I can not even complain about the manufacturing quality.<br /><br />For todays time there are significantly better cameras that cost less than what i paid for this camera - around 450 with a 1gb card.<br /><br />So for the time when it came out and for the service it is still providing it is great, but now in 2008, clearly i would purchase something else.","I am a photografic hobbist.  The Kodak is my 2nd digital camera. I have shot pictures under many  different conditions and subjects.  I take all pics at the 6MP setting because I often pull out and enlarge a subject from the picture.<br />My kodak does a great job with its variety of settings.  It's great.","I bought this camera as a display model from sears and i've had it for over three years already and i love it! shortly after it was purchased, it began acting strangely (turning itself on and off), but kodak offers a free year warranty and i sent it in to be repaired--they replaced the entire processing unit and it didn't cost me a thing! i will be sad when it finally dies on me.","I have owned this camera for 2 years and it needs to be replaced.  It takes nice pictures especially when you choose the scene mode which matches the photo you are taking.  The hardware easily breaks.  As indicated in other reviews, the battery latch didn't last very long before it broke off.  The rotary dial to turn the camera on is very sticky.  You really need to force it to rotate it.","It takes great pictures, and has very easy controls, we have this camera for a few years and are pretty satisfied.  however the lens often gets out of position, and has to be repositioned (a little scary to do as you're constantly afraid you'll break it) in order for the camera to shut.  We even had to send it in to replace the lens after it got totaly bent.  Lately the speaker broke, but the microphone still works wonderfully, so it isn't much of a problem.  All in all its a pretty good camera, as its been taking good pictures steadily.  One negative though is that although you can set it to take multiples of the same image, you have to pause a little before you can take another shot.  Also there is no in camera editing.","i bought this camera when it first came out 3 years ago and have not been dissapointed.  This camera has gotten a workout over the past 3 years, iwth four kids lots of travel and picture taking. .I am an avid scrapbooker and this camera never let me down.  Unlike others, i have overused this camerea, and have never ever had aproblem with the battery latch. Still has the original, and have never had to send it back for any type of repair til now....I dropped it in hawaii and now it turns itself on and off at will. I figured instead of paying for repair,i'd just buy a new one....  cant find one anywhere...  The best feature with this camera is the rapid shutter. I never missed a smile or a special momemt due to the delay that so many digital cameras have.  It's the best i have found so far. I have tried out all the new cameras and even the newer kodaks are not as fast as this one.  I found this site after doing an online search to see if i could buy this camerea anywhere. I dont think you will be dissapointted with this camera. Goodluck!","I like the camera. Has a nice size lcd screen to preview pictures taken and the battery life is great. Also very easy to use. Like at least one other user review stated my battery latch broke also but still works fine it just doesnt hold it in there. It's kinda bulky also in comparison to the newest skinnier cameras. My pictures all turn out 10 times better then my previous digital camera with this one but still not film camera quality. Close but not quite there yet. I don't know maybe it's my shaky hands. Maybe I'll try a tripod and then wright another review.<br /><br />I bought a cheap one before and paid for it. Lost a couple of years of my families pictures because of that. On the other though with this camera they hardly ever turn out bad.","This camera is extremely easy to use. To the layman, the photo quality is superb and better than most comparable cameras I've seen. We've taken thousands of photos with it over the last two years. The battery latch is plastic and may break if you remove the battery for charging on a routine basis. However, the cover that slides over the battery compartment will hold the battery in place, and our camera still functions just as well. A good camera if you can find one for a good price.","If you are looking for an easy camera to use this is it.  It has a lot of options as well.  We have had many pictures blown up into posters with fabulous results.  We simply uploaded them to some internet sights having sales, and are unbelievably impressed.  Thankfully, after almost two years of ownership we have not had one single problem with this camera.  I would definitely buy this again .  Even though we paid quite a bit more money for it than what it is now selling for.","a good entry level camera but don't expect miracles. lot of photo bleach. poor video. sturdy. battery superb. over-all an avg. camera for every day use. if you are investing 200-300 bucks u might as well consider entry levels DSLRs.","This is my first digital camera and I absolutely love it!  I'm a teacher and have taken hundreds of pictures of my students with it.  The quality of the pictures are fantastic and clear.  Many of my students' parents inquire about what type of camera I have because the pictures of their child are so great!  I was even asked if the pictures taken were professionally done!  This camera is easy and simple to use.  So even someone who is picking up a camera for the first time would be able to handle it with ease.  The Kodak EasyShare program (download  program that comes with the camera)  makes it easy to edit your pictures.  With this program you can turn your colored pictures into a black and white or sehpia, you can crop pictures, add a beautiful border shapes (oval, circle, rectangle, or square), remove red eye and clean up the picture quality.  All this can be done with just the click of the mouse on your computer.  This camera is also a 6.1 MP so pictures can be blown up 30 x 40.  Again I am impressed with this camera.  On my teacher's pay, I made sure I did my research prior to buying this camera.  I'm happy with my decision and like the saying goes . . . \"A picture is worth a thousand words.\"","Unlike other reviewers I have had no problems with this camera's shutter button, battery latch or otherwise.  As a matter of fact, at our first trip to the beach with this camera my one year old poured a whole bottle of suntan oil directly on it and it still works!  It even still takes the most amazing pictures! The zoom is fantastic, it works through glass like there is none there, catches action shots amazingly due the quick shutter. And the video feature, talk about great! I wouldn't trade it for anything.  I want one for every one of my family members for Birthday and X-mas gifts!","I bought a different camera after the 3rd battery latch broke.  I love this camera other than that.  I MEAN LOVE.  I am thinking about buying one again and keeping my new one as back up (obviously due to the dang battery latch).  It is easy to use, takes pictures quickly (tough feat in the digital non-pro world) and has a very nice quality.  Stupid latch is my BIG hang up.","I have had 13 digital cameras in my time an im 14, i am an experienced photographer and have won many photographer competitions on [...] and this camera IS THE BEST camera i have ever laid my hands on, its simple, clever, good looking and isnt Cheaply cased and Doesn't break easily at all, the lock breaking theory has been put dwn to lousy handling, i have had mine 2 years and my lock has been perfect an i charge it twice a week, ANYWAYS back to the camera, the pictures are absoloutly AMAZING and Stunning honestly they knocked me off my seat and i have won 16 competitions and have 14 silver an 2 bronze amatuer photographer medals and im 14, i never won a single one until i used this camera, the ease of use was soo great it was like a duck to water as soon as i picked it up i jst cud not stop cliking and my cat was blinded, For the price of this i would expect a lousy 4mp camera but this was cheap,great and absoloutly amazing, IF ANY1 WANTS A GREAT COLOUR,QUALITY, 6.1MP CAMERA THIS IS THE ONE TO GET, I USED TO HAVE A NIKON 8.0MP CAMERA BUT THIS ONE BEATS IT HANDS DOWN, Whether ur a pro, expert or a begginer this will always take your breath away<br /><br />Ryan Rigby<br /><br />contact me if u need any questions answering  razzo12@hotmail.com","I never had a problem with the battery latch... only thing is when I am turning it off and on, the lens squeaks when it comes out.  Taking pics in the dark suck (especially if you dont want the flash)... i was trying to take night pics of my backyard and moon and it came out crappy.","I take a lot of photographs for many occasions. I've had this digital camera for 20 months (I had another Kodak digital 3.0 MP and another brand before this one) and absolutely love this camera. I was the principle photographer at a wedding using this camera and the bride and groom's families were very pleased with the results.  This camera is easy to use and gives you lots of options for scenes and settings(I think I've used them all at one time or another.) Fantastic, sharp amazing color photographs.  (I've added some of my November, 2005 Caribbean Cruise photos above to give you an idea.)The only thing this camera lacks for me is a higher optical zoom.<br />I have had NO problems with the battery latch in the 20 months I've owned this camera.","I bought this camera about three months ago and was really happy with it. I didnt have to charge it that often as the battery life is pretty god. Unfortunately the battery lock broke after about the fifth time charging it. Im currently waiting for Kodak to send it back repaired but im extremely pessimistic since I read other reviews here fearing it might break again.","This is a wonderful camera.  I bought it online at Wal-Mart for 199.00 and that included the dock.","This is an excellent camera. My battery door lock broke, but Kodak had it repaired and returned to me within one week of my having sent the camera in for repair. Excellent service.<br /><br />Fast focus, fast write time, fast turn-on time, excellent dusk performance, reasonable flash, strong performance in daylight and indoor when color-balance is set properly. Some purple fringing outdoors in intense light, particularly off of white objects. Most simplistic camera I could find with the ability to do advanced options, I'd buy it for my Mom as a first digital camera. I would give this camera 4.9 stars if possible.<br /><br />My less tech savvy wife is comfortable with this camera. Easy to point and shoot, enough advanced options for amateur photographers. I was comfortable moving to this from my film SLR.<br /><br />Excellent battery life. Buy a spare battery, the kit comes with an external charger. Prints from Kodak online are excellent, and include many options for sizes. I cannot emphasize how great their support is. If you do not buy this Kodak, buy a different model. Support the company, not many like them anymore.","This is a nice camera, great buy! When shopping and \"doing my homework\", this model is being pulled from most stores for it is last years model. However, it has more features than the current years model. The battery is extremely nice taking 256 6.1MP pictures. I really like the camera's ability to take rapid pictures, while many cameras take time to store the image on the card. It can also open and close the shutter 3-4 times in 1 sec to capture an action, generating 3 or 4 pics. The screen is large and clear even when there is some light or \"glare\" hitting it. I recommend at least a 512MB card for taking 256 pics, because the battery can accomadate.  The camera is feature rich while with point and shoot ease; you can jump into manual mode and really control lighting and time of day shots.  I give it 5 stars becuase it is a quality product and the price is right.","I got this camera to replace my 3.1 megapixel camera by Kodak, and I love it. I stuck with Kodak because I find the quality to be fantastic and consistant.  This camera is an easy point-and-shoot, but also has a manual setting, and many other special feature settings. It's easy to use, easy to carry, and easy to look at. Overall, it's a great little camera!","I bought this kodak after I had purchased an HP 5.0 MP camera. I was dissapointed in the HP. The Kodak is so good at taking pictures & so easy to use that I am now selling my old 35mm Minolta SLR. The picture quality is so sharp it rivals 35mm sharpness. There are enough manual controls that you would find on a good SLR that any want to be photographer will love.<br /><br />One thing I've been reading is that people have been having problems with the battery case cover breaking off. You have to be very careful opening & closing the cover. However all digital cameras have very similar flimsy covers. I work in a Photo Lab and tell all my customers they have to be very very careful with any digital camera battery slot. This seems to be common negative on any digital camera. I have had this camera for a month now, have used it every day taken the battery out every night to recharge and have not had the cover break off yet. If you are careful it wont break. These are not cheap cameras, you just have to treat them with care. Also some have complained about the software, & I have not had any problems with it, it's been real easy to use & print out from.<br /><br />in conclusion this is a great camera that takes excellent photos.","I've had the camera for several weeks and it takes great pictures. Even large bow-ups are great. It's also simple to use, yet has manual controls for the pros. What it lacks is manual focus and a hi-res video mode like the z740 model. why<br /><br />only put low-res video in such a fine camera?  With the epson r800 printer, the pictures have fine detail and great color saturation. This is onee camera I would recommend, but with caveats.","This little camera takes really super photos and the ease of the software included is great.  However, like Dennis in Nov 2004, apparently our camera's wheel that controls the on/off function has broken and we had to send it back to Kodak for repair.  Camera would act like it booted up for about 3 seconds and then would shut down, even with freshly-charged battery or even with the auxiliary power cord.  Fortunately, the camera waited until AFTER our vacation to go on the fritz.  If you buy this camera, get the extended warranty!","As an casual photographer, I had been using my old Ricoh, and unwilling to move into the land of digital.  Along came this camera, and with 6 megapixels for $300, I couldn't resist trying it out.  I haven't been disappointed yet.  The pictures are AMAZING, both in color and clarity, the detail is sharp, crisp and true, and, with the huge screen, picture taking is a breeze.  I've tried several of the various photo styles (night pictures, snow, active children, etc), and each time the pictures were beautiful. I haven't picked up my old favorite Ricoh in months.  This camera even has features for more sophisticated photographers, none of which I am completely familiar with yet.  However, for the everyday user, this camera is MORE than a bargain.","I thought I was the only one, seeing I only bought the camera a few months back it pains me to have such a small thing break. I looked up the warenty, which I still have the ability to use the one year one with the product. Only trouble is they charge you a large amount just to return the camera back to you and you must mail it to them in the first place to have it repaired! Cash out for postage to them and cash out to return!! What a great warenty, not! EDIT: I think I speak for all before me that its not the battery DOOR thats our issue, its the cheap and flmsy little PLASTIC orange lock that is breaking on everyone!! Ihave contacted a few local stores and asked if they have had many issues with this problem and the answer was a clear yes. OTHERWISE this camera is the best one out there, with ease of use at the top of my applaude list!! Clear HUGE pictures are great for large prints. BTW, the Video is 10 times better then the 4mp I had before it, also a kodak. Great sound and very clear video!","Earlier this year I began looking around for a new digital camera to replace my 4 year old, 2MP camera.  After finding this camera being offered on sale at a local retailer it was a deal that I could not pass up.  Being able to print up to 20x30 and 30x40 pictures is a big difference to the 4x6 maximum quality I was getting from my old camera.  Although the many features take some getting used to they come in handy.  They have allowed me to get the best results with pictures shot in many differnt settings.  The camera itself is small, sturdy and has easy to use buttons and dials.  Also the menu for setting camera formats and features is easy to navigate.  I have had my camera for two months now and have not had any problems with the battery latch.  I am looking forward to taking this camera on summer vacation just to see the difference in quality compared to my older pictures.  Great camera for the price.","I love the easyness of this camera, we have one at our school and I use it very often. I love it but I can't print pictures though the printers because the megapixles are so high it jams the printer. But I'd still recomend it. It is wonderful","I also received this camera as a Christmas gift, after much consideration by the buying party.  The features are top-notch, quality is outstanding, and it's very user-friendly and easy to handle, even for novices.<br /><br />MAJOR PROBLEM with the battery latch.  Mine was purchased from a well-known chain, thank goodness a 3-year full warranty was also purchased.  I will be returning to the store for the FOURTH time to replace the camera because of the battery latch breaking.  The first one broke after just a few weeks, the second was broke when I got the camera out of the box, the third broke after 2 days, and now this fourth one has broken after several months.","I had ben wanting to go digital since I like taking pictures, but I'm not very good at getting my film devoloped.<br /><br />The Camera body has a solid traditional feel, and the image size and flexability of control are great for a wide range of users.<br /><br />It takes great pictures. I have taken pictures by accident that were good enough to keep. I also love how I can keep zooming into the images to see very small details.  I normally shoot on full auto or the closeup setting, but it is really nice to have all the different pre-set modes, as well as the ability to take a reasonable ammount of manual control. On the other hand, I have to admit it does have its negatives.<br /><br />The 3X optical zoom is okay (digital zoom is just marketing), but I sometimes wonder if I would have been as happy with the one of the simplier models with more powerful zoom.<br /><br />The battery setup could have been designed better.  The mechanism that holds it in does seem a little too delacate.  I haven't broken mine, but I can see how it happens.  You would think, with the breakage risk, the camera would ship the AC adapter so you could charge the battery in the camera, but the external charger alllows for charging a backup battery, and it only takes two hours.<br /><br />It does not allow you to save raw images. I wonder how good the images and the shot to shot times would be if the camera didn't compress the images (especially using a lossy method).<br /><br />Sure the cell is nonstandard, but I think you get better battery life than three AAA's would give.  I am also not a big fan of the lens cap, but I can live with it.<br /><br />Even with the negatives, I still really like my DX7630.","This is a good camera that takes great pictures.  I enjoyed using it, but the camera has one flaw.  The latch that holds the battery in place breaks easily.  I have replaced this camera twice because the battery latch has broken.  I would have one still if it weren't for the battery latch.  Maybe if they would change this to a more sturdy latch it would be better.","This camera is very good for the novice photographer like myself. When I opened the camera at first I didn't know how to take a picture. This camera has little to no learing curve. I was taking great pictures within hours. Great Bang for your buck. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants to learn digital photography.","I've owned a Kodak DX4900 Digital camera for the past 4 or more years.  It really did a wonderful job for me with it's limited features.  My new purchase is the Kodak DX7630.  It is an upgrade for me and I think that it's just the perfect little camera.  It does everything and more with the greatest of ease.  The controls are simple to use and the features have few limits.  I don't know why the little battery door is giving some people trouble.  For me it functions perfectly.  I figure that they must treating it too roughly.  This camera is a precision instrument and should be handled accordingly.  I recommend it as a \"Great Buy!\"","Very easy to use, great pictures this is a great buy!!!!!!","The people who have had trouble with the battery latch must be opening it with a meat hook or maybe they have man-hands.  Granted its not titanum steel reinforced, but it is more than sufficent for me.<br /><br />This camera takes THE best pictures in its class.  Hands Down.  The colors are vibrent, and the features are simple.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by poor reviews.  It is well worth the money!","I had my DX7630 for less than a week before my battery latch broke. It was the first time I took the battery out for charging. It's really too bad because the camera works great in all other regards and takes great pictures. I've owned three other Kodak models in the past and all have taken great pictures. The battery latch must have slipped through the cracks during the testing phases. Unfortunately, I'll be returning mine and shop for another equivalent camera.","I brought my family into the digital photography realm with DX 7630 as holiday 2005 gifts. 3 total. The technology curve was minimal - my admittedly non tech Dad (email is a challenge) was taking photos in no time and loving that he could delete or save on the fly without 'wasting film'. My Mom and I walked through the software and had photos of the grandchild printing out in both wallet size and 4 x 6 from the Easy Share printer before the day was out. The next week my brothers were sending photos via email and chatting about 'did you know this camera can also do video'...We have had one plastic battery lock snap, and my Mom said that Kodak customer service took immediate responsibility and that the camera is being shipped back to them this week - approximately a 10 -14 day turn around, which was acceptable.","I really liked the camera and it was very easy to use, but the battery lock broke the second day I had the camera.I returned it for another one and the lock broke the first day I used it. The part should be recalled and I would not suggest buying one of these until the part has been fixed.","Too bad the battery lock part broke! It must be a manufacturing defect. I have seen the same issue on other sites.<br /><br /><br /><br />I received this camera as a Christmas gift from my husband. It is an upgrade from my previous easy share. It is simple to use and takes great photos. The software is user friendly too.<br /><br /><br /><br />Big bang for the buck.<br /><br /><br /><br />I am just disappointed that piece broke. You would think a great company like Kodak would have had that problem figured out before they mass produced them. So sad.","I resisted going digital for a long time because I was wary of the changing technology. I wanted to wait until digital cameras became more mainstream. I am very happy with my purchase. I love the results that I have been getting with this camera. My sister and mother have the 5mp easy share and also love their cameras. I bought my nanny the 6.1 and she also loves it. The camera seems to have a good quality lens and the software is very easy to use. My sister really likes using the picture dock, but I didn't find it necessary. You may want to try using the camera without it before you go the expense. I bought an extra battery and a small case for the camera. I have 4 children 6 and under... this is so much easier than using my old bulky camera... and I save money. I take as many pictures as I want to take and then just delete the bad ones.<br /><br />I like downloading my photos to Ofoto for printing. When I had dial-up AOL ot took a long time to download. Now that I have Road runner it is much faster and easier.<br /><br />Having archival quality photos is important to this photography major. I order my photos from Ofoto and then burn my pictures onto a disc. Burning the CD is very easy with the software. -Having easy software for a camera is important. This seems quite easy to me.","This is one of the greatest deals in digital camera history. In fact the DX7630 is nearly flawless. Let's see: 6.1 mega pixels is far more than any other camera company can offer at a similar price, the display screen is so enormous that it makes me wonder why they even bothered with the optical viewfinder, the German lens is superb in quality, there are more picture modes than I care to remember, the camera does an excellent job of focusing in all lighting situations and at all distances, and the cherry on top is the cool audio profiles.<br /><br />My one complaint is that 3x optical is a little lacking in my opinion. However once I think about it, the 6.1 mega pixels allows the use of a hefty amount of digital zoom without any noticeable image distortion. So in effect, the camera has about 7-8x optical zoom do to the huge amount of pixels.<br /><br />This camera is by far the best value in any price range.","This is a very good general purpose camera for those who do not have photography as a hobby.  All of the automatic features can be manually overridden when the camera out clevers itself.<br /><br />One word of warning.  Many store sell after market accessory lenses that will not work on this camera.  Some mechanically interfere with the zoom, others only slightly change the angle of coverage.<br /><br />Digital Optics brand have both problems.  Kodak brand work properly.  The Raynox brand 0.3X also works.<br /><br />People who are enthusiastic amateur photographers with film cameras and are seriously into it to have several extra lenses will be disappointed with the current state of the art in number of pixels.  Those people should wait for 100 megapixel models to become standard.","this camera really outdoes most of the competition, and when you include the low price and other features, there are no real competitors. kodak offers a 3x optical zoom and has over 6 megapixels for super sharpness, even if you decide to enlarge the picture. also, the camera can grow with you as there are wide angle, telephoto and close-up lenses available through amazon. for quick prints, there is also a nifty printer that does not require any computer.  it prints a 4x6 picture in under 2 minutes (also available through amazon). the quality of the print is like a local shop, and the printing method, which uses a protective coating, makes sure the colors last forever (ink-jet printers can run/fade). as an option, local photo shops can print your pictures from the camera or, if you like, you can use a computer.<br /><br />in sum:<br /><br />--the price is great, especially for over 6 megapixels.<br /><br />--kodak is the number one brand for digital cameras. they will be around to supply the camera/your photographic needs. kodak is a trusted u.s. company while some others may not be around in ten years.<br /><br />--it's easy to use (no computer necessary). but if you have a computer, the camera/printing dock can e-mail photos.<br /><br />--the camera has a 3x optical zoom -- super sharp pictures with great color of the kids/nature from far away.<br /><br />some others offer similar features, but nobody has the whole package at this price. a home run!","Over the past few years I have used a Kodak 2mp digital camera but was never satisfied with the results.  I submit a lot of pictures for my eBay auctions and must have clarity of the small details.  I tried my sister-in-law's Olympus 4mp camera with 10x lens, but it did not do the trick without a tripod and many adjustments.  Finally, I came across this Kodak DX7630 6.1mp and found the ideal camera for my needs.  I can take aim and shoot photos, with or without the flash, and I get a great shot most every time.  With so many pixels, I can easily crop and zoom in on my desired areas.  Editting has never been easier.  I bought the extra dock and find it most useful to have my batteries fully charged each time I go to use the camera.  Downloading to the computer has never been easier!  In essence, the 6.1mp has eliminated the need for telephoto lens for me.  You can't ask much more than this out of a simple camera!","I bought this camera because it offers the highest megapixel count of any camera in its price range. I've found the picture quality is quite a good - a large improvement over my previous camera - a 3 MP Kodak DX3900. Don't believe it if a salesman tells you it's not about the megapixels. Megapixel count is the single most import thing in these low end digital cameras. A high megapixel count makes the picture come out looking much clearer and more natural. It also gives you flexibility to crop and blow up a picture without visible loss of quality due to pixelization. I only wish it were 12 MPs instead of 6. I also wish the ISO could be set above 400 - but this is typical of compact digital cameras.<br /><br />The camera's video mode is also pretty cool. With this camera, you can shoot video continuously until the camera's memory is full. With the 1GB SD chip I bought with the camera ($65), I'm able to shoot continuous video with sound for up to 80 min. So the camera doubles as my home movie camera. The video res is only 320x240 - which, again, is typical for digital cameras. I wish it were 640x480 though - that would bring it pretty much on par with a miniDV camera. Video quality is good though, and the sound comes out well. Unfortunately, the zoom is limited in video mode. You can adjust the zoom before shooting, but once video is rolling, the zoom is stuck.<br /><br />The camera has plenty of manual control. The controls are easy to use once you get the hang of them. The menus don't run deep, so almost any control can be set quickly, without having to do too much navigation.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this camera. This camera is as good as or better than any compact digital camera currently out there. To do better, you'd have to get a full sized SLR.","You will eventually want to upgrade to a higher optical zoom.  I did not realize how limiting the 3x is and then when you try to use the digital zoom the picture quality suffers...not good when you are trying to photograph children!  I got a better zoom with the regular 35mm aim and shoot cameras.  But the pictures that I do take are good...not outstanding, but good.  If you have the money to invest, I suggest going with the Kodak with the 10x zoom.  It really would be better...I wish I started off with it.  If you do buy this camera, I strongly suggest that you stay out the the \"auto\" focus and move on to 'scn' 'p' or 'a', you have much more control with how the pictures will be in the end.  All in all, it is worth a try just shop around for the best price...I found mine for $296.00 without having to sign up for a credit card like amazon tries to get you to do.  Also, buy the SD card and upload your pictures often.  I use the 5.4MP so it takes up more space but the picture quality is so much better...especially if you are using photo software and are cropping the pictures.","like myself.  The extent of my knowledge of photography has been the little disposable point and shoots you get at the drug store on a trip.  I always wanted to try digital photography, if for nothing else than the ability to erase my mistakes without it costing an arm and a leg.  I decided on this camera because, in my neophyte photographer's mind, 6.2 megapixels is a lot of megapixels, which translates into a good camera.  What I inadvertenly swerved into was one the best point and shoot cameras on the market.  The quality of the pictures, the wide variety of scene mode choices, and an unbelievable 1/1500 to  62 second exposure times; all these combine into an unbelievable value for the price you're paying.  This camera has opened up a whole new world for me.  And using Ofoto has been the icing on the cake.  When I got my first 20x30 picture of a scene in Tahoe, well it made it all worthwhile.  You will get a lot of enjoyment from this great camera.","Bought this as my first digital.  Simple to use and great pictures. The software it comes with is OK.  Limited editing capability and I don't like JPG files defaulting to the KOdak software, (I can probably change that however)<br /><br />As far as the camera goes it great.","I love this camera.  It takes just as good picture as a regular camera if not better!  You can take pics and if you don't like it (e.g. if someone blinks) then you can delete it right away.  You can also pick out which pictures you want developed and what store you want them developed at and there ya go!  Or if you have a nice printer (which I do) you can print your own.  I highly recommend this camera.","I have used the Kodak cx7530 previously and found the dx7630 to a step up in class, performance, and features.  The 7630 is an excellent, above average, point and shoot camera but the additional SLR-like features really makes this camera an excellent choice and outstanding value!  I have taken better pictures with the 7630 than I have with my SLR!<br /><br />I highly recommend the dx7630 to novice and intermediate photographers.  Even expect SLR user will find the Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon lens, the full manual control over shutter, aperture and ISO speed to render outstanding sharp images.<br /><br />Check out the \"bowl of apples\" images (and others) I took with this camera.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. ultra sharp Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon lens<br />2. full manual control over shutter, aperature, and ISO<br />3. flash intensity compensation (you control the amount of light on the foreground subject!)<br />4. continuous focus mode \"tracks\" your subject without having to lock the focus<br />5. massive and clear 2.2\" LCD<br />6. the rechargeable LiON battery lasts a long time (120 shots where 60 used the flash)<br />7. ISO 800 feature allows natural photos in ambient indoor light.<br />8. 2 JPEG compressions modes which helps if you travel a lot<br />9. 3 modes of metering exposure<br />10. 16 scene modes<br />11. placement of all controls allows single hand manipulation.<br />12. ability to disable digital zoom, choose sharpness, and choose saturation.<br />13. fast turn-on, fast shutter to shot, and fast shot to shot.<br />14. images get auto-rotated when taking a portrait<br />15. LCD goes blank after a while of no-use to conserve power<br />16. very quiet focus and zoom.<br />17. multi-point focus always renders sharp foreground images; i found few images out of focus<br />18. shadows and dark areas are not grainy or noisy; this is helpful when you're cropping pics and enlarging them<br />19. very smooth transitions in bright area and never washed out; this helps you with contrast especially if you convert to black and white later<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. no dedicated self-timer button (only two steps to get to it, though)<br />2. can not use AA but the rechargeable battery lasted a long time and is smaller than a pair of AA's.<br />3. no PictureBridge support but I always manipulate my images before printing a hardcopy so it wasn't an issue<br />4. no self closing cover but i tossed the lens cap and the lens is recessed enough so it doesn't scratch in my camera bag.<br />5. smallest aperature is f8 but then again, this isn't a true SLR","I used to use Canon Powershot S30. I liked it except that the autofocus has never been razor-sharp. This Kodak DX7630 solved this problem. Though in the beginning, various options indicated on a dial were a little bit confusing, once I became accustomed to it, the selection of any option became almost instinctive. The color it produces is brilliant, and one can take good pictures under almost any circumstances. I have not printed any pictures larger than 8X10, and therefore I can't tell the limit of resolution, but certainly it is good enough for 8X10 enlargement. The only disappointment is that one can not select ISO, shutter speed, or f-stop even in the manual, S-, or A-(aperture priority mode)mode. I don't think I missed these options in the instruction booklet. The instruction booklet, by the way, is not too detaild either. I bought optional macro lenses and an adaptor for the lenses. These lenses take extremely good pictures of a flower pedal, a bud etc. Overall, this is not a camera for professionals, but for everyday photography for recording your lives, it is one fine camera.","Love it. I am not by any means a really great photographer.  I do love taking photos of family, pets, projects, etc.  With the dock/printer...I take a photo...see if I like it...and print it out!  Could not be easier.<br /><br />Camera: Comfortable in my hand, fairly small for all the features it has. Fits right in my purse...<br /><br />Lens cap: it's not automatic so I tossed that the first day anyway: not a biggie.<br /><br />Shareware software: easy install on my machine (again..I am not a techno-geek so it has to be plug-play). all set.<br /><br />Dock: easy to hook up to camera and computer. press the print key..and out come my beautiful pictures.<br /><br />I am gifting one set (camera/dock) to grandma who does not believe in atm machines or cash cards.  she tried my set up and PRINTED LIKE A CHAMP.<br /><br />Come on Kodak fans!","After using my 1 Mega pixel Fiji camera for more than 2 years I was shopping for an upgrade. I was looking for an offordable 3 MP camera when I came across Kodak DX7630 6MP camera for lesser price.<br /><br />After reading a lot about digital cameras manufactures by the markets gaints like Canon,Nikon and Olympus, I thought do I have to really buy a kodak. Well I took a chance becuase I got the camera at a very good deal ($250 at Officemax). This deal only lasted for 2 hours (lucky me).<br /><br />After using the camera for a month, I am very happy with the performance. Kodak integrated all the features as a software into this camera. Like different modes (Ladscape,night...) are provided by a touch of a button and the screen is displayed with all the modes.<br /><br />The Quality at 6MP is very very good. The flash works really good unlike my previous camera where I can hardly see something in the picture at night. It comes with a a special battery with lasts very long (approx 90+ pics).<br /><br />The size of the picture is about 2.3 Megabits, so a 256MB card and give you about 99 pics (at 6 MP,High res). Turn on the camera and shoot the first picture in 4.5 secs. Not bad when you don't want to miss any moment.<br /><br />The camera has a bigger LCD to view the images, and the Menus are very pleasent. It also comes with cable to download the pictures and 32MB internal memory when you run out of space in your SD card.<br /><br />Finally, very good 6MP camera for the price.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Cannot use regular batterries. Need to buy the special battery that is compatable.<br /><br />2. The model is bulk and little heavy (but all kodak models are like that).<br /><br />3. No automatic lens cap. You have to put a manual cap like most film SLR cameras.","I purchased this camera about a week ago. It takes excellent pictures. I took my share of bad ones with the old 35mm. Great battery life so far. I've taken about 60 pictures and its still going. I've even been reviewing them on the camera for over an hour so far as well. Very easy to use with 10+ scene types that change the flash mode, aperture, shutter speed and so on, to best fit that picture.<br /><br />Only negatives- no built in lens cap, sometimes while taking multiple pictures the camera shows that it is still processing. This could be that the memory card I purchased is slow.<br /><br />So far I would highly recommend this camera.","I have been looking to buy a Digital Camera for the last several years. The problem always seemed to be that the Cameras I could afford/justify were usually too weak in what they offered. Poor picture quality, difficult to use, etc.<br /><br />Well, finally finances and timing came together and I went shopping. I tried all of the 4+ MP cameras. While many were wonderful, they all came with many features that I knew I would never use. Not for lack of interest, but more that I KNOW I am an amature and the most important thing to me was to take GOOD pictures that I can share with friends and family.<br /><br />Then came the Kodak DX7630. Incredibly easy to use, acessible buttons, menus and features, a huge LCD screen in the back and a whopping 6.1 Megapixels.<br /><br />I have had this camera a few days and like most guys with a new toy really gave it a workout. I took pics in all kinds of environments, all kinds of light conditions and I am AMAZED by the quality. Using the night portrait mode I took pictures of my Mother-in-law's outdoor garden with no ambient light beyond the moon. The pictures came out stunning, so much so that a friend of mine is using it as a background on his computer.<br /><br />Other shots I took indoor and out were just as crisp, just as easy. One of my biggest problems is that I have what is called familial shaking, I simply can't keep a camera perfectly still. I can't tell you how many shots were ruined with my regular camera because of that. The Kodak seems to compensate just fine. More importantly, I get to see the pic immediately and if I have a problem, I delete it and shoot again.<br /><br />The Easyshare does for Digital what the Instamatic did for film cameras. Puts a powerful, easy to use camera so simple that anybody can take good pictures from day 1. Now with 6.1 MP, the EasyShare is a bigger bargain than ever.","I've found the DX7630 to be an easy to use camera very well suited to casual, handheld picture taking. There's not much of a learning curve, the body feels solid in the hands and the image quality is a good match for on-screen use and consumer level printouts. Shutter lag seems minimal, the AF is fast, battery life is long and the large LCD display is easy on the eyes.<br />On the downside, this camera would not be the best choice for more deliberate, tripod bound photography. Aside from the rudimentary self-timer, the DX7630 lacks any remote shutter release option and does not support any uncompressed file formats. Also, the JPEG compression is somewhat excessive and the camera provides no user controlled noise reduction.<br />These limitations shouldn't trouble most Kodak shoppers as this camera really shines in other areas.","Just bought this camera for my wife to replace another camera for her birthday. This camera is so full of features you will never have the wrong camera. Over 20 different scene modes, auto mode and the manual modes (PASM). Pictures are wonderful. You cannot go wrong with this camera. This camera is one of the best point and shoot cameras you can buy when you compare features and price point. 6.1 megapixels, optical and digital zoom, and the previously mentioned shooting modes. Haven't seen too many other offer so much at the same price.<br /><br />I don't understand some of the negative reviews I've seen on this camera. Sure this camera is not perfect. It has its flaws, BUT all are defeatable if you take the time to learn the camera's capabilities. Why would anyone expect pro-level performance at this price point? Beats me. If you are looking for a very good point and shoot digital with great photo quality, this IS your camera. As I've heard from my piano teacher, \"Practice! Practice! Practice!\"","** Update - I just received my first 20x30 picture from Ophoto - It is very impressive. I took the picture hand held at 1/30 second, wide open aperture. Only slight abberation on the edges and, even at 1/30, the picture was sharp and colors true. I'm now trying pictures with a tripod to minimize any movement.<br />****<br />I just received this Kodak camera and took some day and night pictures. I have no problem with the resolution - the prints are more than sharp. In cloudy situations where shade is caused by green trees, I get a magenta color in shadows. This does not always happen, snd I am still trying out different situations. The auto-focus is great, time between pictures is very quick (< 1.5 seconds) and the camera is light with most controls placed well. However, the dial for choosing the mode (Auto, Aperture or Shutter priority, etc.) gets a little difficult to turn at times. It could be improved.<br />The included instruction book is OK, but I found it lacking in some of the features for the camera. For instance, to change the aperture or shutter in aperture or shutter priorty mode, you need to press the wheel in, then turn to adjust the aperture or shutter. I did not see that in the manual (if it's there, it isn't apparent).<br />If you're looking for a more than adequate digital camera that can supply sharp enlargements ( up to 16x20 or greater ) then this is the one to buy. The lens is excellent. I especially like the ability to set the camera manually. Night time pictures were excellent. A great way to explore the world of digital photography."]},{"name":"Pentax Optio S4i","amazon_reviews":["very good","Love this camera, have had it for years until recently my daughter borrowed it and loved it too.

I began to have some second thoughts after I started using it, though.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Ultra-small and lightweight. Goes anywhere!<br /><br />* Easy to use<br /><br />* Fairly intuitive menus<br /><br />* Fast, very little shutter lag<br /><br />* Pretty good picture quality, overall<br /><br />* Sturdily built<br /><br />* LCD screen is big and bright<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* It's almost TOO small -- a little hard to get your hands on.<br /><br />* Some barrel distortion is noticeable<br /><br />* Flimsy little rubber cover over PC/AV port<br /><br />* In very low-light conditions, both viewfinder and LCD become unusable<br /><br />After a week of playing with the Optio, I decided to buy a Kodak DX7440 for comparison, and spent a week trying them side by side. The Kodak is considerably better ergonomically because it's bigger and fits in my hand better, has a more powerful flash, shows less barrel distortion, offers many more scene selections and manual override controls, and its menus are (amazingly) even easier to use than the Optio. The Kodak cameras are often praised in reviews for their picture quality. But I actually found the Optio's pictures better than the Kodak's in most cases. The Kodak produced rather garish, unnatural-looking colors, whereas the Optio seemed to render colors more naturally and realistically. And although I like the feel of the Kodak in my hand, in the end I decided that its relative bulk would make it a lot less likely that I would actually carry it around and use it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I'm returning the Kodak and keeping the Optio S4i.<br /><br />For a go-anywhere, easy-to-use, point-and-shoot camera, it's great!","I have the camera now a few weeks and I can say it is great!!! is small fits in every pocket !!! very good pictures i mean for digi cam ! if U want the best and the perfect pictures then U have to buy the pentax SLR  ZX-7!!! nobody has to forgett this is a digital camera and a friend has the new sony with 5 mega pixel and these camera make not better pictures!!! i can say I'm very happy with the s4i !!! I would buy again!!!","Real nice camera, researched it thoroughly and was worried about picture quality not being as good as the canon elph, but I'm completely happy with it. Panorama is pretty nice and the time lapse video is cool. The size is pretty amazing. You can always keep it on you without realizing it's there. Best digital point and shoot camera I have seen and for only $350, you can't beat it.","Here are reasons why the Pentax S4i should be considered:<br /><br />1) SMALL AND LIGHT- Smallest not only by linear dimensions (also is the smallest by cubic inch 'bulk' as well ) and weights only 4.2 oz WITH battery and memory card.  All with a large 1.8\" screen.<br /><br />2) AVAILABILITY - It is so easy to carry around that I don't leave it behind in the hotel room (how many times have you left your camera in the hotel room while out dining because it isn't acceptable to carry a full sized camera to dinner or other events...and lost the opportunity to capture pictures?)<br /><br />3) SHUTTER LAG and SHOT-TO-SHOT SPEED - Unlike other digital cameras...captures the picture as intended.  Hardly any shutter lag (0.1 sec).  Also important to me is that the time between shots is minimal with the internal buffer.<br /><br />4) LITHIUM RECHARGABLE BATTERY - Some prefer standard \"AA\".  I do not as the \"AA\" will allow less than 50 shots compared to the 200 shots I can get on a single charge.  Why is that important?  I hate to carry multiple spare batteries...and \"AAs\" are heavier (just as an example...holding four \"AAs\" alone feels as heavy as the Pentax S4i fully loaded with battery).<br /><br />5) SECURED DIGITAL MEMORY CARDS - The cards are cheaper in price than Xd or Memory Sticks.  My recommendation ... Panasonic brand high speed SD cards...which are known to be quicker than other brands (Panasonic data transfer write speeds of 10mbps ...which is quicker than the high end SanDisk Ultra II speed of 9mbps).  [Another thought... 4-megapixel is plenty to obtain beautiful 11x14 prints.  Choosing a higher megapixel camera is not necessary as most prints will be made below poster size and all the higher megapixel does is fill up your memory card faster].<br /><br />6) TELEPHONE SUPPORT - Call Pentax customer support at 800-877-0155 and you will see.  Not only for customer support...but technical knowledge and product selection.<br /><br />Suggested accessories:<br />** Spare battery<br />** Fitted authentic Pentax leather case with storage pockets for accessories.  Model PTX-L40.  Bought mine at Walmart.com for $19.34.  Also sold at Ritzcamera.com and Amazon.<br />** Memory cards (I view it as a positive that Pentax is not including a memory card other than the included 10 mb internal memory.  This compares to many manufacturers that are providing a 16mb memory card...which will fit 16 shots at 4mp and are basically unusable).  (Suggestion....Pansonic brand secured digital cards are known to be quicker and higher performance than other brands.  Buy several 256mb cards.)<br />** And yes...an Altoid tin for storage (Fits in the tin and it does close tight for storage.  Just have to shape the box by 1/16\" with your thumb on the initial use to make room for the wrist strap eyelet.  No big deal).<br /><br />My best suggestion is to study this camera in person.  You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I highly suggest the Pentax S4i for any traveler...as well as any parent...who wishes to have a very well engineered camera available...which will last for years to come.","All I have to say is I have never taken so many pictures. This camera is smaller than my mobile phone and is always with me. The fact that it is also a great camera with a number of cool features is almost a bonus. Minus a star for the lack of autofocus assist light but you have to give up something to get everything else crammed into this tiny package.<br />Prior to purchase I tested out the Canon SD110 and SD410 along with the Minolta Xi. This was by far the best of those models in speed and menu systems.","I just bought Pentax optio s4i on Wed, and it came on Friday, amazon is amazing about shipping. When I got the camera, there is no power in the battery, so I had to recharge it, took about 1 hour or so, not too bad to recharge. The user guide is pretty straight forward and explains everything I want to know about aking pictures, different modes and shooting movies. And I can easily use it now without referring back to the book. I put in a 256MB SD card and at the second smallest size (pixel) setting combined with best quality (3 stars)-which is optical for printing out 4x6 pictures, you can take 450 pictures. At the higest setting for both size and quality with a 256mb card, you can take about 87 pictures. I find that really good, and since I usually don't print out anything 8x11, I would set it to a smaller size and get more pictures out of it. And to comment on a previous user about fitting into an altoids can. He is right the bulging part on the left where the strap holder is does make it a little difficult to fit it into the tin, but what i did was stretch the left side of the tin a little by my thumb, and now it fits nicely without being too tight. The top doesn't close completelyy due to an uneven surface but it closes enough so that it wouldn't pop open by itself. What I would do is to go to a candy or toy store to get a cute coin purse that's that size and put in there. Coin purse fabric is softer so I think would protect it more. I have yet to print anything from this camera but i will try soon and see.","Hello to all<br />I bought an S4 last year and it fits perfect in an Altiods metal box ... but the new 4Si has a slightly bigger camera strap bracket that makes it just too tight  in the same box.  Anyone know of a slightly longer metal case?<br />If so - please post back<br />I enjoy the 4Si and recommend it<br />Regards<br />Greg","I was first attracted to this camera because of its size and light weight; the Pentax marketing materials will tell you that it fits in an Altoids tin. Not only can you easily carry this camera anywhere, but the number of functions it has is just amazing. I like the option of composing my photo using a viewfinder or the screen. Instant review, various flash options, and a number of other color and light adjustments that can be made assure that you never take a bad picture. The video and sound recording options are also fun. As an added bonus, the super lightweight battery is rechargeable. I like that I can easily fill the memory card with one battery charge and then quickly recharge the battery for more use. At the end of the day when you go to download your pictures onto a computer, the software and USB cable connection could not be easier to use. After initial installation, it's simply a plug-and-play operation.","A great take with you type of camera.  I own bigger more robust digital camera's, but not every occasion is it appropriate to sling out a big intrusive camera for.  This little guy is perfect for the spur of the moment, gotta have that picture, camera!  I found it really easy to install on all of my computers, from my W2K unit to my XP unit.  Software drivers loaded easily.  I like all the little tweaks you can get the camera to do for you. Take a picture in B&W or Purple tones!!  The 3D feature is cool.  I also loved that as soon as I opened the box I was able to turn it on an use it.  Had 3 bars of battery life in it, started up fine and was able to fool around with it immediatly.  Picture resolution is what I expect.  This camera will never be a SLR, so my expectations are resonable for what I intend to use it for.  FUN!!!<br />The only things I can think of to say are Con's - no memory card or camera case.","Fantastic camera. This camera is probably the smallest one in the market today (I consider it smaller than the new slim Sony T1, which is only thinner (just a bit) but much wider). Pentax loaded this small machine with more functionalities that you can even imagine: B&W, sepia, green photos without the need to use a photo editor. Shoot in museums, snow, portrait, landscapes, sun, night, etc, by just selecting the appropriate occasion on the display and the camera will automatically adjust the exposure and speed. Good battery, won't die on you in the middle of the day.<br />The only cons until now is that it may be too small! Watch out not to leave it on a restaurant table!<br />Suggestion: Buy the pentax case PTX-L40. You'll pay a little premium on this case but it fits the camera well so that you do not buy a small camera and put it on a huge case (buy a huge camera then!).<br />If you are looking for portability, without lacking functionalities (optical zoom, 4 megapixels, good battery life) this is the way to go. Buy with confidence, Pentax has been specializing in the camera market for decades!<br />Hope this helps,<br />JC","Without question the Pentex Optio S4i is the best ultra-compact currently available.  After much research, I have not found another ultra-compact that even comes close in performance, features and small size to the S4i.<br />Currently, its closest competitors are the Konica Minolta Xg and the Sony DSC-T1.  The Xg is much larger and lacks many features which are available on the S4i. The only feature better on the Xg is its 320 X 240 @ 30 fps movie mode (320 X 240 @ 15 fps on the S4i).  The Sony is also much larger and has a much higher price tag.  Again the movie mode is better with the Sony-640 X 480 @ 30 fps.<br />Pros:<br />-Smallest ultra-compact available in its class<br />-Excellent quality 4.0MP photos<br />-Packed with features<br />  -Nice Panoramic mode which provides you with a \"ghost\" image of<br />  the previous shot to help you align the next shot.<br />  -Very interesting 3D mode<br />  -Excellent Super-Macro<br />  -Many more modes to chose from<br />-Strong aluminum alloy body has a solid high qualty feel in your hands<br />-Large LCD screen<br />-Plugs into your TV for a slide show<br />-Charges battery in the cradle while battery is in the camera<br />-320 X 240 @ 15 fps movie mode with sound.<br />Cons:<br />-Lack of control over shutter speed and aperture (only a concern for those who want complete manual control for depth of field effects and certain light conditions)<br />Consider the Pentex Optio S40 if you want an ulta-compact that uses AA alkaline batteries.  Its a little bit bigger than the S4i, yet has the convenience of common batteries.<br />I am very happy with my purchase of the S4i.","I'd been thinking about buying a small digital camera for about 3 years. My girlfriend continues to impress me with her pont and shoot, on the go picture taking ability with her tiny camera. That's what I was looking for, a camera that disappears when you don't need it.<br />I was originally looking at the Nikon 3100. However, while visiting in CA, I was introduced to the Optio S4i. What a small camera! And 1 megapixel more than the 3100. All for about $50 more (or more than that, now that the 3200 is out). I did some reasearch online that night and decided to buy it the next day.<br />Have not been disappointed yet.<br />The picture quality is very good (not the bestest). The lag time is negligable and I find the interface for the most part intuitive. It has a lot of handy modes to help one take a great picture. The idiot modes included in the camera's software are great! Makes a spontaneous picture look even better. I know that a lot of people gripe about not being able to manually control the camera, but his is not what this cameral was built for. It's built for take-along point-and-shoot fun where you don't have to think too hard. Continuous movie mode at 15 frames per second is also very nice. The size is also perfect. About the size of an Altoid can - slips into a pocket easily. Tamrac makes a great carrying case which accomidates the camera and a couple of SD cards.<br />The only gripe I have with it so far is a minimal \"fishbowl\" effect that is only noticeable when a lot of straight lines are present (took a picture of a tiled floor). However, this is found in most point and shoot cameras (some more than others), so no big loss.<br />Overall I'd say I am very satisfied. This camera will keep me happy taking pictures for a long time. When I get used to digital pictures, that's when I will go for the SLR, control everything camera. And even then, this camera will still be great for vacations and outings where a 17 pound camera bag is a third wheel.","While I initially bought it for the size and features, my friends and I can't believe how wonderful the pictures are that it produces!  The best thing is that I can keep it with me in my purse and take pictures anytime.  It really makes you love taking pictures again.  I'm using it in the \"best\" picture mode, and both the 4x6's and the 8x10's I've produced are fabulous.  I had been hooked on my Elph (non-digital APS camera) because of the size and had all but stopped using my 35mm SLR, but this produces better pictures (especially closeups), has all the advantages of digital, and is a lot smaller.  A couple of reviews of this camera and its predecessor, the 4s, mentioned that 400 ISO pictures are noisy.  While that's true, you'd have to manually select 400 because I have yet to find any of the \"auto modes\" that choose 400 speed - most are done in 50 or 100 speed regardless of the light, and the shutter speed compensates (and/or the flash compensates). The night mode does a great job if you have a tripod or brace the camera (4 second shutter speed). So unless you want to take a lot of pictures of moving subjects in dim light, or can't hold the camera still, I can't see that it would be an issue for any point-and-shoot type of usage, indoors or out.  In comparisons with 8x10 closeup pictures from the Canon S400 and Nikon 4500, I'd challenge you to find any negative differences.  The \"flower\" mode does soften the sharpness a tiny bit, but I found it to be more aesthetically pleasing.  If you like it sharper, you can use another setting such as generic \"picture mode\" or \"landscape mode\".  (It's interesting to review the metadata information on the computer after taking shots with different settings and in different modes.  You can see how it adjusted the contrast, saturation, white balance, etc. in addition to the shutter speed/ISO info and more)  The best use I've had so far was last Saturday night when my son brought his date here to get prom pictures.  I took a few shots (reviewed them on the spot - retook one when I noticed it would look better if she wasn't holding her purse) then came inside, downloaded them, reframed one of them to be closer and printed them out before they left.  His date not only had some great pictures from the prom, she had pictures to take TO the prom!  Everyone was thrilled!<br />By the way, I use MicroSoft PictureIt Professional and an HP 2210xi printer to print them, and have found the results to be fantastic.  Printing from the Optio software seemed to be fine too. (I was not pleased with the printed results when just using the HP printer software to print - that's true regardless of what camera was used to take the picture or even if you scan in a non-digital photo.)","I have to start off saying how much I love this camera.  I've had a few digital sub-compacts over the last few years, with the last being the Casio Exilim series.  This camera totally beats all of the Exilim's hands down!  I am VERY impressed with how good the camera's pictures are!  This is probably the most noticeable thing right off the bat.  On my old Exilim, the pictures were kind of dark and fuzzy around the corners, but not so with the Optio S4i!  This camera is wonderfully easy to use and packed full of features.  Even though I read the manual from cover to cover, the menu's are so simple and intuitive, I could have used it without any manual reading. To my surprise, this camera even records sound in Movie mode, something most of the Exilim's don't.  The movie mode even appears \"smoother\" than the Exilim's, despite the fact that they both take pictures at 15 frames/second.  Overall here is what I liked and didn't like:<br />Pro's:<br />-Outstanding pictures and quality (most important)<br />-Extremely easy to use<br />-Packed full of nearly every feature you can think of<br />-Movie mode comes with sound<br />-Ability to look at pictures on T.V. (can't with Exilims)<br />-Very large LCD screen on back of camera<br />-Small size makes easy carrying and encourages more pictures<br />-Macro mode is just unbelievable - 3\" - WOW!<br />Con's<br />-LCD screen is \"washed out\" in bright sunlight, but then again, I haven't found a camera LCD that didn't do this, just some are better than others.<br />-Battery life could be a bit better! About comparable to the Exilim series.<br />-If one takes pictures to battery depletion (which I always do), you must recharge the battery first in order to download the files to your computer.  The battery charger which comes with it only charges the battery, you cannot download the files while the camera is attached to the charger.  This is a cheap shot from Pentax in making the customer shell out another $50 for the optional AC adapter to avoid this quirk.<br />- If you use a \"normal\" non-high performance SD card, (which I use), there is considerable lag in continuous picture taking since the file has to be read to the card prior to taking the next picture.  Shell out more money for a high performance card, and this will be greatly minimized.  In all fairness, though, the average user probably will not be using this camera for fast-paced \"action\" shots, so this is only a minor inconvenience!<br />Overall, though the Pro's far outweigh the Con's, and I have to say that this is the best camera I have ever bought!  I highly recommend it!  I'll probably keep it until they get 6MP cameras this size. Given the current trend, (seems about 1MP per year), it should be in about 2 years!  RECOMMEND HIGHLY!","I have the Canon Digital Rebel SLR for use in all of my performance shots.  However it's terrible for vacations where hiking, biking, or activites are involved.  In comes the Optio.  #1 on my feature list when looking for a second camera was size.  The Optio will fit in a tin of Altoids.  Second I wanted a good lens, optical and digital zoom, and simple menu navigation.  Check, check, check.  I was also surprised to find that the Optio had an LCD screen that rivals some of the larger SLR camera's.  This camera is absolutely perfect for the activities that I take it on.  You won't be dissapointed.","Everyone has different Camera needs.....<br />We started with a Nikon 995 (that we have had since it came out).<br />** My wife wanted a purseable camera.  She wanted a Large screen and for it to be easy to use for good photos.<br />I wanted it to take good pictures, have a real Macro mode (around 2 inches), remote (a  $30 option) + video out (for family portraits), Manual focus, good low light focusing, and to be a fast shooter, Tripod Mount and a good battety life.<br />This Pentax Optio S4i does all this and more and it is incrediably easy to operate. Not just the basics, even the more advanced features.  I  considered its almost twin the Casio Exilim EX-Z40 (same lens)but worse menus, (Casio has No remote option or video out), but it has a 2 inch sreen instead of 1.8 (both screens are same Resolution though) the casio does have an almost double life battery that so far is not available separtely for eihter camera (the two take the same batteries).  Basically the Batteries last about 300 shots, the old around 150 (710ms vs. 1230mA [the battery model #s are D-LI8 and NP-40] Addiitonal and OEM and third party ones are $18 to $40).<br />If it matters pentax is actually also smaller then casio about 2/3 the size.<br />Also considered Sony T1, and all Minolta's Dimage X/t/i/g and of course Canon's Elph series.  For me they were all lacking a feature or two or three+ (Be it Macro, Tripod mounts, remotes or more).<br />You can go to reads reviews on dcviews.com (a meta site for news and other review and news sites).  As I write this the Casio is reviewed the Pentax has not been.<br />What could they have added still: 1) (a tiff/raw image mode) 2) An AF Lamp always helps even though this camera focuses 10 times better in low light then my Nikon.","Incredibly small (you just can't prepare yourself for how small it is), great photo quality, extremely easy user interface (didn't need to read the book to figure out the basics)<br />Seems to get warm after being on for a few minutes, no longer fits in an Altoids tin (because of the camera strap), buttons could be bigger/easier to use.<br />I'm replacing a Nikon 990 (very large digicam) with this. I'm simply tired of missing photo ops because I don't have my cam with me. I'm highly impressed with the S4i - the quality exceeds my expectations (and I've been considering this purchase for quite a while.) It's just so gosh darn cute too!","This is a great digital camera. As a professional digital camera workshop lecturers, my husband and I have a lot of experience with a wide assortment of digital cameras. We also own the Casio Z4U digital camera which is the competition to this digital camera. So we are not without a lot of knowledge and great deal of experience.<br />The Pentax S4i is a major change from the Pentax S4. The LCD has been enlarged, a docking station is now a part of the package, and the ISO is now adjustable up to 400 ISO instead of the 200 ISO that is available on the Pentax S4.<br />All in all the Pentax S4i is a much improved digital camera when compared to the Pentax S4. While the Casio Z4U measureably looses digital image resolution and quality when digital photos are taken in less than \"normal\" lighting conditions, where higher ISO settings are required, the Pentax S4i is able to handle increased ISO settings with many fewer problems.<br />In the final analysis, the S4i is a better digital camera in our opinion than Casio's Z4U. However, please keep in mind that the Casio Z4U, while it cannot shoot video clips, does have a \"Best Shot\" capability which allows pre-set settings which are very convient, especially for beginner or novice digital camera users.<br />The choice is up to the purchaser, however, we feel that the Pentax S4i is a better digital camera than the Casio Z4U.","I just got my a week ago and have been played with it a little.  For me, I just need a digital camera that's easy to carry around; shots relatively good pictures; easy to use.  I mostly just use it to take day to day pictures, so nothing fancy.<br />The camera itself is pretty slick; all metal body, the keys are pretty intuitive, large LCD screen, turn on time is fast.<br />Some concerns:<br />1) No SD card included, so you really need to buy one, the 10M internal memory aren't gonan hold much. I bought the panasonic 256M SD card here also at amazon and it worked wonderfully.<br />2) No protective case at all, so the LCD is exposed all the time which maybe dangerous. I haven't found a good case for it yet.<br />3) The battery charge is easy to use, just plug the camera in; you can also charge the battery seperately.  But it takes a while to recharge.  Also, the charger is made of white plastic and just looked cheap.","Hi, I just tried out the S4i and have to say I'm disappointed with it.  I was really excited due to the size and small lag time.  I did a comparison of the s4i and my existing Canon S400 and the Canon wins with no question.  The image quality of my Canon is much brighter and sharper than any of the images on the S4i.<br />Couple of other things I don't like about the S4i.  The USB Cable isn't a standard size.  Why?  Also, you need to load the specific USB software to get XP to \"See the USB Storage Device\".  It should show up as a camera.  I didn't have this problem with the Canon s400.  This is Pentax's way to get the consumer from returning it once they've tried it.  All stores say that you can't return it once the software's open.  When I opened my camera the software was already opened so I'm sure I'll have fun returning this.<br />I would go the the S400 or better for brighter and sharper pictures without the fuss and software.<br />Good Luck","So the deal is, I shoot photography in a professional capacity. I recently moved to all digital in my SLRs, which has resulted in some pretty satisfying results. I get awesome picture quality, superb tools for post processing, and no longer really have to hassle with developing film. But one thing was missing... convenience and portability.<br />My pro kit bag weighs in at about 17 pounds fully loaded. My camera and lens of choice weighs in at over four pounds just on its own, and it's hardly what I'd call pocketable. So I started searching for an ultra small, ultraslim camera to do the trick.<br />My search took me to a variety of \"influencer\" sites including dpreview and others. I read like a madman. I looked at picture quality. I read comments by current users. And I weighed positives against negatives. My choice was narrowed down to the Pentax Optio s4 and I was about to buy, when I found out the new s4i was coming out. It made my choice a lot easier. I'll outline more below.<br />I placed a preorder on Amazon, and took delivery of one of the first shipping models. I guess that's extreme early adopter for you - the camera wasn't even supposed to be available till April 1, but I had mine in my hands by April 2. I've used it for five days now, and while that's a short time to evaluate something, it's long enough for me to give it a thumbs up. Here's what I like:<br />Extreme Small Size: This is one of the smallest digicams on the market, but it's ruggedly built with lots of aluminum and metal surfaces.<br />Large (relative) LCD: a big step up from the s4 is the 1.8\" LCD on the s4i. May not seem large, but considering the small size of this camera, it's massive.<br />Streaming Video: very important feature for me. My previous digicam (before I went dSLR) was an Olympus C-5050, and I loved the fact I could fill a memory card with one long video. This one lets me do it too.<br />Image quality's okay: at ISO 50 and 100, images are good, colour tone is decent. At 200 it's losing me, and at 400, it's terrible, but at least it goes to 400 ISO. The lens quality's okay too - nothing's changed from the s4 model, and the sample images you can find online show it's a decent snapshot capture device.<br />\"Stupid\" Modes: Normally I'm not a fan of what I call \"stupid\" modes - you know, put the camera into a mode where the camera makes decisions for you (ie Museum mode, Night shot mode, Portrait mode), but I like the versatility in some of the modes on this camera. My faves so far: 3D mode, food mode (works well!), text mode and digital filter mode (I like taking a picture of myself as someone skinny!).<br />\"Lifestyle\" Features: on top of being a digicam, this camera has additional lifestyle perks. It has a capable audio recorder mode (which I plan to use while conducting interviews for articles I write). It has a world clock function (though accessing it is a bit of a pain, unless you map it to the quick button). It has not one, not two, but three alarms, which can be set for once or daily (hey nice feature - a $350 travel alarm clock!).<br />There are some negatives:<br />Shot to shot performance: in a word, it blows. This thing can take a first shot quick (lag time is very short). But in \"high speed\" frame mode, you're lucky if you can get one shot every two seconds or more. Maybe if you have it set to manual focus or something.<br />CCD is tiny = Grain, Chromatic distortions: because the CCD inside is so small, you end up with pictures with grain in continuous colour areas, and you see a lot of purple fringing in photos with high contrast.<br />It may be too small: I've got big mitts. This thing feels like it's so small, it may fall out of my hands at times. The textured alum on the front helps though.<br />Overall.<br />I wasn't expecting a camera that could rival a Nikon D70 or a Canon Eos Digital Rebel in image quality, and you shouldn't either. But if you want a good quality camera for taking snapshots, movies, recording audio (sounds good too), and something you can wear around your neck or make disappear in your pocket, this is the model to beat. I'm very happy with the purchase."]},{"name":"Pentax Optio S40","amazon_reviews":["This was my first pocket camera and has thousands of miles on it now.  It fits the pocket and has all the features I need while traveling light.","Most important, and most obvious fact, is that the Pentax Optio S40 is not at all a current item.  It's ready to retire.  When making a purchase, be sure to heed the four stages in the lifespan of a digital camera: New... reaching its prime... over the hill... and finally (for the Pentax Optio S40)... ready to retire. As such, the going price for an operating Pentax Optio S40 camera is now about $ 5.00, at a yard sale, or flea market  -and that usually includes a handy SD card left in there by the previous owner.<br /><br />And my entire review is based on this item as a $ 5.00 camera.  And, for those who take their photography seriously, even $ 5.00 is just false economy.<br /><br />But, back to the title of this review, and in all fairness, most digital cameras are not NiMH rechargeable battery-friendly. The Pentax Optio S40 camera will shut down when the NiMH rechargeable batteries discharge down to 1.30 volts. Whereas other brands of digital cameras may continue to take photos below 1.30 volts, only for the hapless photographer to later discover, back on their home computer, that those \"below 1.30 volt\" jpeg files are often corrupt. The 1.30 volt cut-off is simply an indication of an effort by Pentax to set higher quality standards.<br /><br />But to keep life simple, and permanently solve the problem, use a CR-V3 rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which delivers 3+ volts. A single battery, cleverly molded to fit snugly into the two-battery compartment, the lithium-ion chemistry is claimed to hold its charge for up to a year. In fact, I also use this handy, yet economical set of two CR-V3 rechargeable lithium-ion batteries + wall charger + 12VDC auto plug: 2 Lithium-Ion Battery&Charger for Kodak CR-V3 CRV3 Advertised as a 4.2 Watt-hour battery, which translates to about a 1.4 Amp-hour (=1400mAh) capacity, it charges up to a good 3.28 volts. And the rechargeable lithium-ion chemistry will hold a full charge for months, and has a life expectancy of about 600 cycles, more than making up for its lower storage capacity. Unfortunately, many twin-AA 3 volt digital cameras and electronic devices are designed not to accept this unique type of battery.<br /><br />Another common issue with this camera is that the Pentax Optio S40 never did take hand-held indoor ambient light (no flash) photos well, unless there the room was exceptionally bright. At least a monopod mount is required for most indoor, quality ambient light photography.<br /><br />Tied in to the above issue is the issue of focus:  If, after a couple of seconds, automatic focus fails to lock-in to the subject, one has to remember to quickly select the manual focus (MF) mode, which works quite well  -but only for still shots.  Again, at least a monopod mount is a minimum requirement, as even outdoor shots can be unnervingly out of focus, and not obvious until later viewed on a home computer.<br /><br />Yet another issue with this camera is the time required to shoot and process each photo:  I usually shoot 640x480 (0.31MP) photos, for ease of emailing, posting to the web, etc.. But a 2304x1728 (4.0MP) will take about 8-10 seconds to process, an unnervingly long time when waiting to take the next shot.<br /><br />But back again to those who really prefer to use NiMH rechargeable batteries:<br /><br />With freshly charged (1.45 volts) 2500mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries installed in the Pentax Optio S40 camera I am able to take about thirty 640x480 pixel photos (half of them with the flash), plus a 30-second video.<br /><br />That's right on par with 1.5 volt AA disposable alkaline batteries (which are so toxic in the landfills, I feel should be illegal). Just be sure to use a high grade NiMH-specific charger for all of your NiMH batteries: For 30 minute quick charges I use a RadioShack Model 23-1305 charger that individually monitors and effectively charges an ecclectic mix of up to four AA or AAA batteries, of differing brand names and mAh capacities. For overnight charging, as well as rejuvenating tired old NiMH batteries, I use a C.Crane KC-983 charger that individually monitors and effectively charges a matched set of up to four AAA, AA, C or D batteries, of the same brand name and same mAh capacity.<br /><br />But most NiMH rechargeable batteries on the market self-discharge, some as much as 10% per day. And when the NiMH batteries drop to 1.30 volts, that annoying \"Depleted battery\" screen message appears and the camera shuts down. This means that NiMH batteries will self-discharge in the camera to a \"Depleted battery\" condition within 24-48 hours. I've even tried out some of those new \"slow discharge\" NiMH batteries that promise to hold their charge \"... four times as long...\"  -which simply means that your NiMH powered device will always be in a discharged state every time you really need it.<br /><br />But I have had decent results with the Energizer AA 4x NiMH 2300mAh battery, but unfortunately was unable to find an exact Amazon.com product to link to from here, since I picked up a 4-pack of these at a local Home Depot store. Straight out of the charger, the surface charge of 1.43 volts per battery self-discharges to 1.40 volts by the next day, but stabilizes and continues to self-discharge at a much slower rate until, about 30 days later, both batteries are self-discharged down to 1.30 volts each.<br /><br />And also, there's an occasional quirk with this camera, as another reviewer also pointed out: There is a capacitor in the internal circuit that can be degraded with long term low voltage battery use. This means that, occasionally, even with a freshly charged pair of NiMH batteries, that irritating \"Depleted battery\" screen message may appear. But a quick fix, as the same reviewer pointed out, is to load a pair of 1.5 volt AA disposable alkaline batteries, turn the camera on, and then after it boots up, turn the camera off. This will recharge that capacitor and allow NiMH batteries to be used again. As mentioned, this is only an occasional issue. What I prefer to do is run a rechargeable 3.6 volt lithium-ion battery (650mAh) into the external 3 volt DC jack (standard \"A\" plug, 2.35mm O.D., 0.7mm I.D., negative ground: positive tip, negative barrel) to jump-start the problematic on-board capacitor (plug in, turn on camera, allow camera to completely boot up, turn off camera, unplug). I will then be able to use NiMH batteries again. A good habit is to give the camera a quick 3.6 volt lithium-ion shot into the external 3 volt DC jack, before loading up a freshly charged pair of NiMH batteries.<br /><br />Yet another reviewer pointed out a valuable trick that I'd like to reprint, just so it doesn't escape anyone's notice:<br />  An undocumented \"reset\" for the camera:<br />  From the OFF state, press and hold MENU as you press then the POWER button.<br /><br />Final Notes:<br /><br />The reason I put up with this camera is that it does the job. With up to a 12x optical-digital zoom, full VHS (320x240, 30 fps, with audio) avi-file movie capability, and many other settings, it will do most of what I need it to do. And when set in Auto Select mode (aka: Smiley Face mode), I can let others use the camera  -and with acceptable results.<br /><br />And another good reason for using an old, somewhat obsolete digital camera is that I am willing to subject such a device to extreme punishment, take risks in damaging, losing, sometimes having my camera stolen.","The picture quality of this camera is average.

NOW THIS CAMERA WORKS PERFECTO!","My parents surprised me with this digital camera as a present and it has been a great camera after I put the manual down and started taking pictures. I wound up teaching myself how to use it (the delete function has been a primary learning tool!).  I figured out what works best with the multiple settings and options via trial and error...kinda a challenge for  a beginner but~I love it now. The only issue I've had is how sensitive it is with movement.  If it's not still for particular shots a slight shake or vibration and the picture turns out blurry or distorted.  I have been Using a tripod which reduces this and have discovered which settings are less \"touchy.\" I am having fun and getting great shots as well. In addition I enjoy being able to record audio and videos.  I can record approx. 1 hour of video with my 1 gig memory card.  I like the filters and extra settings for shooting different environments.  Overall it has been a good camera for me.  I am hard on my equiptment and this camera has endured. I would recommend this camera to anyone who already has experience using digital cameras and wants a fun compact camera loaded with interesting extras.  Good luck.","The Pentax Optio S40 was designed to operate with the 3 volt crv3 battery even tho Pentax says you can use rechargeable NiMh batteries which are rated at 1.2 volts each.  A AA size NiMh battery in good condition will deliver about 1.42 volts which in my experience operated my S40 for about 18 months with regular recharges.  Now they do not work even when fully charged.<br /><br />Interestingly the S40 works fine with plain old Duracell AA batteries, but keep in mind they deliver 1.5 volts each (actually more when new). The problem seems to be there is a capacitor in the camera that seems to require a charge even for simple non flash operation and it appears the capacitor can be degraded with long term low voltage battery use.<br /><br />My NiMh batteries began to work once again after a short period of S40 use with the Duracells.  My theory is the Duracells at 3+ volts total, had the power necessary to charge up the capacitor to the point where the camera will now operate with the lower voltage MiMh batteries (about 2.8 volts total when fully charged).<br /><br />My latest approach is using a Lith ion rechageable crv3 from Radio Shack which delivers 3+ volts. I suspect this will permanently solve the problem.<br /><br />OF COURSE the eye piece is there for a reason....using it rather than the LCD will greatly extend battery life.","Could not have been happier with the camera.  It was easy to use, easy to learn how to use it, and was a all we could want for our daughter's first digital camera.","This camera was purchased because of its low price, low weight and small size. It was going to be installed in a radio controled airplane.  While this camera has many interesting bells and whistles, its ability to control contrast and to capture colors is poor, compared to Nikon and Canon of similar megapixel ratings. I could see little difference in contrast  when the in-camera contrast was adjusted, and reducing the ASA/sensitivity did not help.  The shadows and blacks always had a strong blue cast, even when cloudy/sunny settings were manipulated. The quality of the images were even beyond the help of Photoshop CS. I recommend it only for beginners.","I already have a Nikon D70, and I just wanted something I could carry around in my pocket.  I got it through Amazon.com at a refurbished price, and for that price I have to give it four stars. If I had to pay list I'd only give it 3 stars.<br /><br />I've been having a lot of fun with it, and it's a great little camera that didn't cost me much.<br /><br />Good points:  Very small and easy to use for beginners.  Lots of settings that should please anyone. 4 megapixels for adequate 8x10 prints.  Good closeup and super closeup macro modes.  Lots of data for each picture, including a histogram. Uses easy to find AA batteries.<br /><br />Bad points:  Small LCD screen. Very noisy (grainy) expecially at low light levels. No way to manually set shutter speed or aperture. Very slow starting up and writing to memory. Relatively short battery life (get rechargeables).  Flash seems to want to go off for any shot in low light, even outdoor's shade.<br /><br />Otherwise, the camera seems to be fairly rugged. Again, perfect for someone who wants a go anywhere camera for taking snapshots. If you want great quality images I suggest you pay more and get a better camera, but this one was hard to beat at the refurbished price.","I wanted a good quality camera with a zoom lens I could keep in my back pocket. The depth and clarity of the photos are truely unbelievable for such a small camera. I found that natural light is always better than the light from the flash. Also, don't expect a super-high powered zoom lens, this lens is perfect for cropping subjects a little closer. I use the movie feature often, it is perfect for making internet ready movie clips. I just plug into my powerbook laptop and without clicking anything the files mount onto my desktop.","I ordered the Pentax Optio S40 the other day online and well today i got it. I opend the box and put the batteries in and started shooting. Its pretty easy to use and the quality is pretty good. Transfering the photos to my PC was easy. I havn't read the manual completely yet so ill probably do that later. I love the compact size because it makes carrying the camera easier. My first camera was a Fujifilm Finepix camera and it was bulky and heavy. I'm happy with this little cam and its nice aluminum body. The only problem i had with the camera was when i was playing around with it in Happy face mode and it somehow froze up. None of the buttons were working and the lcd was on. The lcd didnt freeze because when i moved the camera you could see the movement on the lcd. When i pressed the power button to turn it off nothing happened, so i opened the battery slot and it shut off and when i closed it and turned it back on it said depleted batteries and turned off. So i opened the battery slot and took the batteries out then waited for like 10 seconds and put them back in and turned the camera on and now it works fine. Dont know why it happend and i hope its the last time it happens. But overall this is a pretty good point and shoot camera for those casual photographers who dont need to spend a gazillion dollars on a camera.","While walking thru Costco this morning I saw the Pentax Optio S40, it really looked great, I,ve owned quite a few Pentax Products and always found them to be well done with few exceptions, the S40 is no exception.<br />In a very impulsive mood I bought it, took it home, knew nothing about it, but was glad to see it uses AA cells, I did not read the manual, I inserted (2) fully charged 2200 milli ampere hour AA cells and my own 256 meg card, then started shooting pictures.<br />The results were superb, the color is excellent, required no correction at all, I took about 200 shots, the batteries are still going strong.  True, on the screen, it looked like they could be sharper, when printing they were beautiful, ,,,,<br />Since then, I have been reading not such great things about the S40, I disagree with all, this is a first rate, beatifully made machine that is just a joy to use, I am going on a vacation shortly, the D40 will be with me.<br />Coul be I am lucky and got the best D40 ever made, I doubt that, I cannot recomment the camera more enthusiastically, I think I should read the instruction manual now, it could help even more","The S40 is a very convenient size and light enough that it can be worn around your neck or carried in a shirt pocket.  It uses two AA batteries instead of a proprietary battery, so you can power it with a couple of sets of rechargeable NiMH batteries.  It has a 3x zoom and a nice selection of different shooting modes.  The user interface is pretty good - you can select the 'hot buttons' that are most frequently needed to change resolution, exposure override, etc.  So far, so good - right?<br />Unfortunately, image quality isn't on a par with other 4MP cameras.  The S40 that I had was consistently soft along the left side of the image and had a similar, although smaller area on the right side of the image.  Image sharpness wasn't great throughout the frame regardless of the zoom setting, although the colors were accurate and well saturated.  There was a good bit of distortion at the widest setting, although this seems to be pretty common with very small digital cameras.  I was diasppointed enough with the S40 to return it - a pity, because I loved the small size and light weight.","The Pentax Optio S40 is ideal for consumers who want a small, durable, attractive camera that delivers merely tolerable performance and image quality. the lens produces invariably soft images, and the auto focus and shutter response seem to be relatively slow. My last camera was the more high-end, enthusiast-oriented Nikon Coolpix 995, but I couldn't tuck it in the pocket of my jeans and forget about it like the optio S40. In terms of aesthetics, the S40 rivals Canon's Digital Elph series, with its sleek, flat design and brushed metal exterior. Photographers seeking more versatility will want something larger, more complex, and more expensive, but casual snapshooters who want basic shots and short video clips (with sound) at parties, on trips, etc. will probably be satisfied. This camera is a pretty good deal at costco, which is the only store I know of that will accept returns on digital cameras without a 15% restocking fee. All in all, the Optio S40 is not a bad value. Compare to the Canon Powershot S410, Nikon Coolpix 3200, and Kodak Easy Share series.","I purchased this camera for my Dad for fathers day.  The main reasons for the purchase were:<br />1) A \"Smiley Face\" mode  - The \"smiley face\" is the symbol on the camera to select full automatic exposure.  My parents want to take snapshots not worry about the exposure settings<br /><br />2) Ability to use a variety of batteries - the camera accepts a Lithium Ion rechargable battery pack, AA rechargable batteries and AA alkaline cells.  if they're traveling and don't have recharged batteries, then alkaline AA batteries can get them through in a pinch<br />3) size / portability - it's a small camera - the length and width is about the size of a credit card and the depth is about an inch or so.  It's more compact than the Canon Elph series or Nikon Coolpix.  If the camera is too bulky, the won't carry it and use it.<br />4) Price - even though it is a 4 Megapixel camera, it is priced in line with the 3 megapixel offerings from Canon, Nikon and Minolta.  I bought it from Costco for $279 and that included the Li On recharger, a 64Megabyte SD card, and several rechargeable batteries<br />I had the opportunity to try it out with my parents to make sure that it worked and ensure they could use it.  Here's what we found:<br />Picture Quality - Picture quality is good for snapshots, it's a little soft relative to other 4 megapixel offerings, but certainly better than 3 megapixels.  The color balance is good and the pictures are sharp.  We had the pictures printed at Walgreens and one could not tell that it was from a digital camera<br />Flash performance - the flash is a typical flash for a compact camera - not great, but usable.  It has a range of about 10 -12 feet<br />Cycle time - the camera is not the fastest - it takes a few seconds to cycle up and down between shots.  It is about the same as many of the other digital cameras I have used.  I think Canon SD 110 and Minolta Xg are definitely quicker<br />Program Modes - The \"Smiley Face\" mode does a great job of exposure settings. It truly is set and forget<br />Battery performance - we got about 25 shots on a set of AA alkaline batteries, using flash for all pictures and using the LCD as a viewfinder<br />Construction - the stainless steel housing feels solid and makes it easy to hold withuot shaking the camera<br />In general, the camera is great for the price.  It is not as good as other 4 megapixel cameras I have used, but the camera's low price means that it should really be compared with 3 megapixel cameras, in which case it is a great value.  The issues with the camera are typical with other point and shoot cameras in this size range.","Camera has a good mechanical interface that is very well designed and easy to use.  Picture quality looks to be very good.  Size is wonderful.<br />The software interface on the other hand.  Manual does not mention it does not work with Windows 98.  There are a lot of people still out there using Windows 98, the manual does mention it does not work with 95.  I had to contact Pentax Tech Support to find out this gem.  So I am awaiting my order of an XP Upgrade.  I was not impressed by the Pentax Tech. Support on their web site.  Very weak FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions).  Ability to search any type of knowledge base was also very weak.  Sony at least had the information on their site, when I had problems with my Sony camera, even if finding it was very frustrating.","I bought the Optio S and quickly returned it as I was really disappointed by the photo quality. But I loved the features so I thought I'd give Pentax one more shot (pardon the pun). The Optio S40 really fits the bill for what I wanted; a compact digital camera that I can carry with me when my Minolta A1 is to cumbersome that would produce reasonably nice prints. The S40 can be a little picky at full telephoto but otherwise it seems to perform very well and quick too. I'm sure once I learn about this model's capabilities I will be even more pleased with my purchase. At $100 bucks less than Canon's S410, it's a real bargain. By the way, if you are comparing this model to the Minolta Xg, don't bother. The Xg was an even bigger disappointment that the Optio S. Happy Shooting!","I've been using the Pentax S40 for the past three weeks, and am pleased with my purchase. I too selected this model because of the AA battery capability and have found the battery life to be very acceptable. I took over 100 flash pictures yesterday on a fully charged set of NiMH batteries. Spare NiMH batteries and a charger are quite cheap and most folks would carry a second set anyway.<br />The photographic results are quite impressive. Certainly on par with my other digital camera which is the (much larger) Sony DSC-F707, though the slightly lower resolution (4mp to 5mp) would likely show on an 8x10. The viewfinder doesn't show the full size of the scene being framed on the LCD screen, but I believe this is true of most digicams.<br />The telephoto works smoothly, and the LCD screen provides a clear and smooth look at the scene being framed. As with most LCD displays, it becomes less useful in bright sun.<br />The camera is easy to set up and its menu system is intuitive and logical with a surprisingly large array of photographic options. It can also be used as an auto focus point and shoot camera with good results as my 12 year old daughter did recently on a school trip. Subsequently she spent a bit of time learning the camera, and now navigates the menus, etc., with ease.<br />I'm using a 256mb Simpletech Secure Digital (SD) Pro-X High Speed card which has a much faster (10MB/sec) transfer rate than a standard SD card. The faster write speed frees the camera for its next shot much more quickly, and you won't believe how fast it transfers 256mb to a PC over a USB 2.0 (separate USB 2.0 reader needed) connection - whew!<br />I also purchased the Pentax Optio Warranty Extension which gives this camera a full three years of coverage. I figured my family will be using this camera for at least that long.<br />All in all, this is an excellent and fully featured camera in a very small package.","hi all, i've been eyeing this camera since the announcement from pentax in feb and quite pleased when i got it from my local retailer.<br />all in all, i like the fact it's using 2 AA batteries only and that it's really slim and compact without bulging parts. pictures are good enough for an average consumer who isn't looking for \"national geographic\" standard pictures or anything like that. functions and features are good as well as the ergonomics.<br />some might find the lcd blacking out while the flash is charging annoying, but it's actually good to me in the sense that at least i know i can't take pictures since the flash isn't ready! (lcd display returns when flash is charged, ie it's ready for another shoot!)<br />battery power isn't all THAT bad... unless u really shoot alot and left it on most of the time. the camera heats up slightly after about 5 mins of it being switched on. i recommend getting a 256mb SD card since the video capture can take long video clips.<br />those with problems with video capture: have to hold the shutter button halfway down until it registers before fully depressing it to start capture. to stop just a full depress will do.<br />i had some problems downloading the pictures initially. apparently i need to have the camera switched on BEFORE i plug the usb connection and not switch on the camera AFTER i plug as stated in the manual.<br />great camera for it's price as i think you can't really get any better camera that's cheaper! AA batts are great since i really like the flexibility of buying off the shelf if batt runs out when i'm out.","I chose this camera over the S4/S4i due to the fact that it uses AA batteries.  (I have rechargable batteries up the wazoo, thought that made the best sense...)  Well, I've only had the camera for several days, and my initial impression is that battery life is poor.  I did have lowered expectations about the power supply, and this camera failed to even meet those.  I suppose I'll just have to live w/ the fact that I'll be changing batteries often.  Otherwise, I really like the camera.  It's built like a tank, really easy to navigate the menu systems, takes decent pictures, is only VERY slightly larger than the S4, and is priced 100 bucks below the competing Canon 4megapixed compact model. (although, due to numerous complaints about pentax quality control, I did pick up an extended warranty which kind of negated the price savings)<br />UPDATE 6/6/04<br />Either I got a lemon, or this camera is incredibly fussy about rechargable batteries.  I can pull a set of freshly charged batteries out of my charger, put them in the camera, and the battery indicator is already yellow (low charge).  I then repeat this procedure for all of my available batteries and most get the same result.  I went out and purchased a set of 4 AA NiMH with 2100mAh capacity and two of the batteries work fine in the camera, and the other two get the same low charge indicator right after they've been charged.  If it weren't for the fact thay I only bought this camera for casual use, I would toss it in the trash!!","I just purchased this camera in order to take pictures at my father's funeral to pass to family and friends.  I had been in the market for my first digital camera.  I wanted to get a camera from a camera manufacturer.<br />I chose the Pentax for the resolution per dollar and look and feel.  I love the size that easily fits in my shirt pocket.  I took over 100 pictures over two days without having to change the battery.<br />The different picture modes will allow for easy picture taking for kids and novices to use but still has the settings to manipulate the picture for more advanced users.<br />I don't mind the slight pause between pictures since I don't take rapid pictures.  I didn't buy the camera to replace my video camera or to record audio but to take pictures and replace my point and shoot film camera.<br />I compared the Pentax S40 with the other 4M pixels offerings and found this to be the best in price. I wanted to have a metal body that will be able to withstand the bumps it will receive.<br />I love the fact that when the camera is powered off the lense fully retracts into the camera.<br />I made digital prints and found the quality to be the same as film pictures.<br />While only having owned this camera for just a few days I am pleased with this camera.  I continue to learn how to speed up the picture from point to capture.  This comes when trying to capture the smile or expression of a baby that is bobbing and moving.  I got better at capturing this as I went along.<br />I recommend this camera for all those that either want to upgrade an old digital camera or to enter the digital camera market.  I am very pleased...","I just purchased this camera and have been using it for a few days extensively.<br />Positives:<br />1) Ergonomics - look and feel is very nice.<br />2) Picture quality - the picture quality is also very nice.<br />3) Batteries - one of the reasons I bought this was the fact it takes AA batteries, unlike most other small compacts I considered.<br />4) Manual controls - the camera has plenty of manual controls, more than I'll ever use.  I especially like the ability to select 4MP/3MP/2MP/1MP resolutions, each in FINE quality mode.<br />5) Movie mode - shoots at 30fps which makes for smooth movies albeit at 320x240 (quite acceptable for a camera).<br />6) Menu system - quite easy to learn and navigate.<br />Negatives:<br />1) Performance - unfortunately, the camera is a bit slow, even with a high speed SD card.<br />  a) Shot-to-shot - in 4MP/Fine mode is just over 5 seconds with flash, and just over 3 seconds without flash.  This is with post-review off, which usually helps to some degree.  This performance improves slightly as resolution/quality is decreased.  For example, at 2MP/Fine without flash shot-to-shot is under 2.5 seconds.  Note this performance is with a high speed Panasonic SD card.<br />  b) Continuous mode - the camera can shoot 2 pix while in continuous mode in about 2 seconds.  Then, a noticeable delay for the 3rd and subsequent pictures.  This is for 4Mp/Fine, and does also improve for lower res/quality.<br />  c) Start-up speed - no better than 4-5 seconds.<br />Overall, I really like this camera, and would recommend as long as its coupled with a high speed SD card."]},{"name":"Canon EOS-1D Mark II","amazon_reviews":["Still working on this one, but lots of light works great I believe the focus of off some will most like send it back for the Mark III are IV","Good camera, condition was good.","Love this Camera","Great old pro body that still churns out excellent photos. 8MP seems low to today's standards, but in reality, is still three times the resolution that 1080p is so it's perfectly fine for web media, and normal print (8x10, up to 14\", etc).

When we opened the box, the camera looked like a new one. No scratch, coming with a charger and a battery (that was already charged). My boyfriend very pleased with his birthday present and I'm very pleased with my purchase.","a first class professional camera.produces incredible image quality.built to last for many years.even in 2016 it still out performs most crop sensor cameras regardless of make.","And it is still an absolutely amazing camera, from the fps, image processing, to the battery which can go hundreds of shots between charges. I sometimes think about upgrading to the Mark III or IV but can't pull that trigger. Absolutely reliable.","I had been waiting 3 years for any manufacturer to market a camera similar in specification to the Canon EOS1. As exploration Health, Safety & Environment advisor, work takes me to middle of the desert or the oceans. The wait was for 35mm film quality, with speed of picture taking (5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the EOS 1 was desired). There was a parallel wait for an Image Stabilised 28-300 zoom lens.<br /><br />Let's cut the story short. If I want a camera to bring on holiday, it would not be this one - the battery and charger are too heavy and bulky; instead I would choose the EOS20D without hesitation.<br /><br />But having hundreds of failed 35mm film frames I decided not to wait any longer but to buy the EOS1D Mark II because the 1Ds Mark II is not fast enough at 4 frames a second.<br /><br />With 35mm cameras, after a few seconds on the shooting, I would have to run back inside to the cabin (of a ship) to change film. If there is large enough memory card in the EOS1DII, there is no need. This camera is built with seals against the environment (and so does the 28-300mm lens). Instead of being scared of running out of film, now it is easy to keep the shutter button pressed while panning (and hoping) the dolphins do their jumps into the air.<br /><br />With the 28-300mm lens attached, there is no need to change lenses either. Dolphins riding the bow wave of the ship could be captured at 28mm while those further away could be caught with 300mm setting.<br /><br />It is a disappointment that the battery is not LiOn but the older NiMH. But as with any photo gear requiring a battery it is wise to have a spare, whatever the substance. I just wish Canon package a small travel size charger instead of the standard one which is very bulky. It has connections for two batteries (yet it could only charge one following the other) but most people would be happy using one battery while the other one is being charged. You just try to convince some airport officials to let you on the plane with the above kit, binoculars, laptop, mobile phone, GPS.......ext. hard disk....as hand luggage.<br /><br />For work, I am committed and therefore bear the weight and troubles of hauling the hardware. But for holidays, I would choose the EOS20D with built-in flash because who would want to lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun and possibly a tripod?<br /><br />The camera gets 4.5 stars but the battery and charger lets it down. Why just 4.5 stars ? One of the beauties I had thought with digital SLR was not having to do anything in processing, just transfer the images to the computer. Wrong. The .jpg straight out of the camera is not sharp enough. Post processing is required. Why ? Why is that necessary when the Canon S60 (which I use for different assignments (with underwater housing)) doesn't need to ? That defeats the point of having a .jpg file at 5.5 Meg when the 1.5 Meg of the S60 looks sharper straight out of the camera ? Still, there is RAW if the standard output is not suficient.<br /><br />Incidentally, the EOS1DsII also produces 5.5 Meg .jpg and those also require post processing. For those of us who are not interested in working longer than necessary (me) 16.7 Million Pixels would seem a bit wasted.<br /><br />I am still waiting for the camera which produces sharp .jpg files in-camera without having to post process, and can shoot at 8+ fps with a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film. Meantime I shall have to learn to shoot with RAW files and post process.<br /><br />Also incidentally, the sensor size of the EOS20D is smaller, which means although itself is lighter than the EOS1D series camera, having to carry around an extrawide lens is not my idea of fun on holiday. The magnification ratio for the EOS1DII is 1.3 whereas the EOS20D is 1.6. This means I could still travel reasonably light (compromise) with the 1DII and 28-135mm IS lens attached. Sure it is possible to use stitching but that is more time spent at the computer and time is precious.<br /><br />Any regrets ? None what-so-ever. It is state of the technology at the moment. Another benefit of using digital is that, it doesn't matter if you had been shooting ISO 100 all day. come the night if you want to shoot the rig with a moon as backdrop, just change to ISO 1600 without having to bother about \"pushing2 the film in developing. It's a beauty when an IS L lens is attached. You'd need IS when there is machinery vibrations and the ship is moving with the swell ! Good job Canon. Now you need to shoe horn in a more capable CPU (to process the images in-camera), fit the 1DsII sensor into this one or this motordrive into the 1DsII and you may persuade me to part with more cash.","I just upgraded from a 20D, and the speed just blows the 20D out of the way!! Image quality runs about the same for both cameras since they're both 8.2MP, but how the camera gets you those images is simply amazing. Fastest shutter out there, low noise, consistent color, spot metering, multiple spot metering, weather sealing, the list goes on and on!! This camera demands the best glass, but you won't be sorry.<br /><br /> If your serious about photography in any field, this camera won't disappoint!! A bit pricey, but believe me, it's worth every penny!!!!<br /><br />See some of my work at (...)","eos-1d mark II digital this camera  i use two months a little hard  to use because it has a lot of things.<br /><br />i am not a proffecianal  but i liked very much<br /><br />the pictures is the best like any camera i had.","I'm a recreational photographer, and I love this camera. This is my 7th month with the beast -- since I pre-ordered it early from Amazon by MISTAKE. (Long story)<br /><br />Before buying the 1D Mii, you should know a few things:<br /><br />1. It's easy to overlook the spec that the camera's USB connection is 1.1 not 2.0. This is 40 times slower, and Canon clearly intended the Mark II to be connected via firewire. That said, I occasionally use it with my laptop on the road, which only has a USB connection. It's convenient that the port is there, but my 1GB CF card takes a good half hour to empty.<br /><br />2. By the time you've attached a solid L series or comparable lens to this camera, it weighs enough that lugging it around on your shoulder, even without a camera bag full of tricks, is quite a burden. Also, I was talking to a professional photographer who wouldn't buy the model just because cameras this heavy give her wrist trouble. If you've NEVER held a camera this size in your hand, I recommend borrowing one first or checking our your local camera store, even if you do ultimately buy from Amazon.<br /><br />3. The camera conveniently supports both SD and CF cards. Unfortunately there's no way to copy between the two cards using the camera. It's not a gigantic deal, but there were times I had to wait to get home from a trip to free up the SD card when I didn't have a camera cable, but just an external CF reader.<br /><br />Those are really the only 3 things I wish I'd known before I bought the camera...but would they have affected my purchase? Probably not! As I said, I bought the camera by mistake.  Has it been loads of fun? Definitely. I have prints almost as good as medium format - at 100 times the convenience.","I cannot say enough about this camera!  From the moment you pick up the box, you know you have quality.  The construction and materials used is top notched.  Contents of the box can be found elsewhere, so I won't bother with the details.<br /><br />Charging of the battery to full takes 2hrs.  If you have memory on the battery from repeated charges without complete depletion, you can recondition the battery with the included charger.  It just takes 8hrs.  While many lament the fact that no Li-ion battery was included, Canon seems to have anticipated the needs of professionals in the field.<br /><br />One also has the option of being plugged into the AC outlet and not dependent on batteries.<br /><br />Reading the manual takes a bit of time.  The camera has endless customizable functions which can be overwhelming at times.  Not that it should deter you, but one will rarely need all those functions anyway.<br /><br />Using the camera did not seem too difficult.  Many functions need the use of two buttons, which may take some getting used to.  Navigating through the menu was confusing initally, but improved as time goes on.<br /><br />Autofocus speed is responsive and sharp.  Shooting at high ISO's (>1000) had minimal noise.  Looking at some of my pictures taken with 1 fluorescent light in the room and an ISO of 1600, appeared as if a flash was used.  Photos of my black lab was incredible considering the ambient light and high ISO.<br /><br />The camera is always ready to go.  If you are in the manipulating within the depths of the menu heirarchy, and want to suddenly take a shot, just press on the shutter button, compose, focus, and shoot.  Its quick and responsive.  Incredible...!<br /><br />Some may be wondering the sizes of the pictures.  JPEG's have 4 sizes and range from 1 - 2.8 MB; RAW files are 8.4MB.<br /><br />One can take an average of 800 - 1200 shots on a full battery charge--assuming one has the capacity to hold it.<br /><br />Prints on my i9900 are outstanding.<br /><br />Cost is a pretty penny and then some.  Also consider that Amazon is an authorized Canon reseller.  Many of the rebates require that you purchase from an authorized reseller to be eligible for the rebates.  Also, some of the internet deals for the camera are not from authorized resellers.<br /><br />Overall, a very impressive camera.  The cost for many may be prohibitive for many.  The EOS 20D may be a more cost effective alternative, but I do NOT regret my decision one bit.","Canon's EOS-1D-Mark-II -Best Performer of the Decade..<br />Reviewer: Jim Wilson (fau@bellsouth.net) Boca Raton, Florida, USA, June 3rd, 2004/9pm<br />Canon's EOS-1D-Mark-II -Best Performer of the Decade.....<br />This mini-review will give some initial impressions with the first week of use and testing. I was one of the early users of the DCS-560 Canon/Kodak cameras, which was great camera for its time however at $25m a copy. Looking at this new Mark-II with its feature set, pixel count, image quality, speed, in camera processing parameters, 8+ fps.... the list goes on and on... what a performer. This digital camera has almost everything for a broad range of uses. With 8.2MP sensor and using LizardTech's PrintPro to up-size the image 250% produces huge images which would challenge the best medium format digital backs. The images are pure, clean, crisp, and accurate. If you're a RAW shooter the included software will give all the post imaging adjusting one can imagine. Many of my assignments have good or controlled lighting therefore I'm quite happy with in-camera processing. I go with +1 or +2 ticks on the sharpening, and +1 on the color so the skin tones are more towards tan. This heavy duty camera, literally heavy, is such a wonderful piece to work with, its worth the extra size and weight. When one combines this camera with Canon's line of \"L\" series lenses, this gives the user an incredible feeling of confidence when on assignment, whether taking pictures of products, food, science, fashion, engineering, construction, or action sports for NCAA events. This camera also re-defines quality low-light imaging. An ISO of 1600 produces images with very good results, and images at 3200 are surprisingly sharp, which until today was unheard of. ISOs of 50 through 1250 produce clean noise-free, or near-noise-free beautiful images.<br />As to image sizes, when shooting in JPEG mode, the user may change the JPEG compression settings from numeric values from 1-10, as with Photoshop when saving images. I set the JPEG value to 10 which produces file size of about 6 million bytes +/- 1 million bytes, depending on image detail and light level; low light, high ISO will result in higher image sizes. Therefor with a 2GB data card expect 330 image capacity. Using the FireWire interface, downloads average 5.5MB images at the rate of about 10 per minute.<br />As an opinion, in the future several items Canon could work on to improve this already beautiful masterpiece:<br />1. Use a full 24mmx36mm imager<br />2. Increase pixel dimensions to 3600x5400 pixels<br />3. Increase near-noiseless ISO's to 6400<br />4. Decrease camera weight and size<br />5. Change battery system to Lithium-Ion.<br />6. Provide an extra-bright 3\" diagonal LDC display.<br />7. Oh why not, ...lets ask for 12 fps.<br />James L Wilson, Prof., Principles.of.Digital.Photography and.Post.Image.Processing Florida.Atlantic.University Boca.Raton.Campus Operating.Entity.BocaDigital.LLC.

A few years back I bought this camera from my best friend for $250.00. He simply wanted a more compact camera that they now have today. The camera is remarkable!  The clarity of the pictures is as good as any 35MM camera I have used in the past. I basically use mine for pictures to post on Ebay.  And the camera produces awesome results. The Ebay ads look great using actual pictures of the item being sold. Outdoor use, the camera works excellent as well. Now discontinued, the unit still sells NEW in the $600 range if you are lucky enough to find one. Used they range in the $90-125 area. I highly recommend this brand/model for anyone looking for a camera that's in a category by it self. Great camera, great pictures!!!","This camera is pretty awesome. If you are trying to capture moving objects though, you won't get much. It seems to take so long from the click to the actual picture taking, that you just end up with a blur.","Nice quality.","VERY GOOD","Good camera","I had a camera just like this one. It stopped after 8 years. The best thing about it is the Panoramic feature that lets you take as many single photos as you want to do a 360 photo. it also has a 5 shot BSS (Best Shot Selector) that selects the sharpest photo of the 5 shots that it takes and saves the best. It isa good replacement for the one that quit on me.","My original 8700 was rained on, dropped, battered, and bounced everywhere in my backpack.  Yet it lived many years before it gave up.  I loved that you didn't have to \"line in\" to deal with your chips, allowing me to carry extra chips while traveling and take thousands and thousands of photos.  I also loved that the battery can be removed to charge, allowing me to carry multiple batteries on a trip.  It also has excellent default and auto settings so that you don't have to read a manual when you're moving fast.  So I decided to take advantage of the chips and batteries that I had and buy another -- I'm not sorry.","This camera, when in production, sold for a retail price of $999.00.

(this is well documented issue, especially the low ISO noise)<br />as far as processing the pictures I would give as little of it to the camera and instead touch-up what I can on my PC because every function adds seconds to the lag-time between shots and is something to be expected.","It is light weight, not that easy to use but still ok.<br />It only supports CF memory card! No SD/XD...in these days...how can a digital camera does not support SD/XD?","Bought this camera in Dec 1996. Found it to be a very complicated camera to use unless you shoot in Auto mode. In Auto it produces excellent Quality photos. Don't Recommend for Actions shots. Stills are excellent. Too many buttons to manurover around if you want to shoot other than Auto.I paid $999.00 plus Tax at Comp USA. A bit pricy,At this price you can buy a nice DSLR.Good luck in Figuring out how to use Filters. especially the ones that you like.","As a one time semi-pro photographer, I wanted to get into digital photography from a \"real\" standpoint. While there are many good camera brands, you just don't go wrong with Nikon. I wanted a camera that looked and felt like a real camera. This is not our first digital camera, I gave my girlfriend a nice Fuji Finepix for Christmas. For an accomplished long time 35mm guy it was strange looking at an LCD Screen to set up your shot. On the Nikon, push a button and the LCD information shows in the eyepiece viewfinder with a diopter adjustment like a true 35mm SLR.<br />  The LCD screen rotates and swivels so you can take shots and see them from armslength distance. Picture holding the camera above your head to get a shot and rotating the LCD so you can see and set up the shot. I wanted to be able to manually take photographs and still take \"point and shoot pix\". I am still reading the owners manual and learning many of the fine points of operation. So far I really like this camera, within 5 minutes out of the box, I was taking pictures, and the nice thing about digital is you don't have to keep the bad shots. I am confident that this is goinng to be a great camera for my needs","I originally purchased this camera based on rave reviews in Consumer Reports, and have not been disappointed. It is amazingly easy to use, but has many advanced features - many of which I have yet to touch. I've logged about 2,000 photos with this unit. I rarely run out of space on the SD card. The only quirks is that you can sometimes get it into a weird mode, then have to review the manual to figure out how to back out of it. Not very intuitive, but then a cameras feature set is not like writing software. I recommend a small camera pack and extra battery so you can swap out when needed. The tele lens is unreal, I have taken long range photos by just hand-holding the camera that came out pretty nice. For really long shots, use a tripod. The telephoto lens goes into digital mode when zoomed all the way out. I was in Disneyland taking a photo of some guy on the Matterhorn and was able to get an unreal closeup that came out crisp. Even zoomed back to normal the camera collects a huge amount of data that you won't realize until you copy it to your computer.","I've had a few digital cameras before this one, and I hated the quality of each and everyone of them.  I was a novice (still am very much an amateur, so don't expect technicalities in this review) I was drooling over a Rebel that I can't afford nor, do I know how to use yet when I came across this one.  I wanted a camera that took good crisp, clear shots, with good color.  I have a digital scrapbooking business and my camera is a HUGE part of my business, so macro shots had to be good too.  Plus, I scrap my own children's photos, using the fine setting on this camera, and they are perfect!<br /><br />I have to agree with the sports shots and knowing the sport before hand because of the lag time, and you have to have the button pressed half way down focusing before the action you want to shoot occurs.  Figured this out when my son does goal kicks in soccer or the other team is coming at him for a goal shot.  I have to have it focused and ready before he goes to grab the ball.<br /><br />I only use optical zoom and it is AWESOME.  I can be sitting across the field from him where he is playing and still get a clear shot of him, and you can't tell how far I was from him.  I was really impressed.<br /><br />The color, I love the color.  Like I said, I've had a few doozies for digital cameras, before I really learned what I was looking for in a camera, getting pictures that were either washed out without color or pictures that were almost yellow in color.  I love the color that I get with this.  My youngest daughter had the bluest eyes, and I would almost say this enhances the color of her eyes in a picture.<br /><br />I can say now that I am a Nikon woman and when I can upgrade, I'll be staying with this company.","The 8700 is the successor to the 5400 and 5700, now with 8:1 zoom.  It has all the features of a SLR with a LCD monitor but is smaller and lighter (no interchangeable lenses).","I'm a novice photographer and the Nikon 8700 was the first camera I bought<br />that was a step above the point and shoot Olympus camera I've owned for<br />over 6 years.<br /><br />I had read many great reviews on this camera and it lived up to all those<br />expections, minus one: this camera is not ideal for taking sports or<br />action pictures.  I was quite disappointed with the results after trying<br />to take decent pictures of my sons playing indoor basketball and outdoor<br />soccer. I finally did some research and learned that (like another<br />reviewer had observed) only digital SLRs have the responsiveness and<br />speed and capability to take action pictures.  With the 8700, the shutter<br />lag speed is one factor- you click on the shutter release button but it<br />takes a portion of a second before the camera snaps the picture.  I then<br />thought that with manual settings (shutter release priority mode)I could<br />correct that behavior, but no combination of settings changed or improved<br />the result.  The result was the images coming out blurry.  I was surprised<br />at this and thought it was a camera setting, but after doing some more<br />online researching I found out that (1) the major digital camera review<br />sites do not seem to cover any sports or action picture taking and<br />(2) a lot of users of the 8700 did report the same problems that I<br />encountered and (3) you can improve sports shots by learning some basic<br />techniques because some claim that no matter what camera you have, you<br />do have to apply some of these techniques, which is basically predicting<br />your shots and having knowledge of the sport in hand so that you know<br />when to prepare for your shots.  In either case, those folks did confirm<br />the weak sports mode and limited capabilities of the 8700, which seem<br />to be more pronounced than other cameras.<br /><br />As a novice user, the only other negative aspect of the camera is its<br />difficult access to the options, which is not intuitive, especially when<br />you don't use the camera a lot and you're under time constraint to take<br />a picture (of a sports scene) and don't have time to fumble around to<br />figure out how to change a camera setting.  And I'm quite a technical<br />guy who had already read the user manual.  I'm sure with time one would<br />be more familiar with the menu system and how to tweak a specific setting.<br />I guess the camera's strength of many features can be its own weakness.<br /><br />Other than the two above mentioned weaknesses, I would have to say that<br />with the many still shots of landscape, people, and even animals, this<br />camera has made me look better than my novice photographer status.  Along<br />with the Canon inkjet printer I have, I can print out better than the<br />lab photo quality pictures at home.  However, I am looking for a true<br />digital SLR just to compensate for the lack of a decent sports mode in<br />the 8700.  Better digital SLRs have either 3 or 5 fps for continuous<br />shooting modes versus the 8700's 1.5 fps, but of course they are in<br />two different classes and price ranges.","This is a wonderful camera, for me.  I don't know much about photography and admittedly don't understand all the bells and whistles it offers but it does work great on mostly automatic focus.  Only slght difficulties with a sort of slow shutter release requiring complete steadiness when shooting.","I have owned my Nikon 8700 for almost two years and have taken over 7000 photos.  It is a very good serious amateur's camera and might make a reasonable back-up for a professional phtotographer. The 8 megapixel resolution is enough for moderately sized prints, up to about 11 x 14, assuming no cropping.<br /><br />The zoom lens is reasonably fast and quite convenient.  Autofocus is normally pretty good, but as one approaches close-up shots with long focal length and moderate or low light, it fails quite regularly.  One can see it 'hunt' right through the perfect focus and choose something not even close.  Otherwise, the optics seem pretty good.  The viewfinder is bright, but it is really small. It will indicate whether the subject is in the frame, but it will give only a hint of what the final result will look like.  This puts it at a great disadvantage to real \"through the lens\" slr's.<br /><br />It will produce very sharp images under moderately favorable conditions.  There is  only a little barrel distortion and vignetting at short focal lengths, and virtually no chromatic aberration. The jpeg compression, comes in three flavors: basic, normal, and fine.  Basic is alright for small snapshot photos and shots of very smooth things, but it produces a lot of jpeg artifacts when trees are cast against the sky or other places where irregular edges contrast with the background. Fine mode has very little of this problem.  In-camera sharpening works reasonably well, though even the lowest level will produce banding artifacts in high contrast areas. These will typically be visible only during image editing, though.<br /><br />Color reproduction is generally quite good, but dark and midtone colors between blue and red - especially those between magenta and red - will often appear to be qualitatively very different in the photo from what they do to the eye.  It is something that can be repaired in Photoshop, but anyone without a really solid image-editing program will be tempted to throw the camera against the wall.  In other words - if you want this camera, you need to have an image editing program that allows adjustment of curves, and adjustment of hue and saturation for the six primary and secondary colors. My cheap Fujifilm 2800 is much more faithful with these reds.<br /><br />With eight different modes of operation including landscape, flowers, indoor portrait, fireworks, and panorama, the electronics offer a good variety of modes.  I use floral and landscape all the time, and they work quite well.  Floral mode offers five zones that you can use for focus and exposure metering, making this a really handy mode for all kinds of close work.<br /><br />Other modes are not quite as good.  I tried nightime landscape last night.  It was a full moon  - one of those 'bright as day' nights.  But the shutter did not stay open long enough to register any sort of an image, except for a ghostly dark gray image of some pure  white surfaces. Similarly, the flash manages to make everything look ugly.  This may not be a quality unique to this flash, but I would never use the flash except for cases of slight fill when the subject was 6-10 feet away. In its defense, there is a hot shoe and if I were not in the habit of using natural light for everything, I should have mastered this art by now.<br /><br />Most of the controls are intuitive and easy to use.  There is a bank of controls that naturally falls beneath the left hand when one is steadying the camera.  These include the jpeg adjustment, self timer, and the flash mode selector.  I have ruined many dozens of shots by accidently pressing one of these.  Almost every photo-shoot in moderate or low light finds me waiting for the self-timer. And I went a whole shoot doing \"basic\" mode when I intended \"fine.\"<br /><br />The body is solid and it is mechanically quite sound. It fits the hands quite comfortably. Fit and finish are very soli.  After two years of moderate use, the camera seems none the worse for the wear. Even the decals are in mint condition  I have two batteries and a charger, and find that this is just barely enough. I also bought a 1 gigapixel card and would not reecommend anything less.<br /><br />I have owned three film SLR's and I could never recommend trading to this camera from a film SLR.  I have scanned a number of slides and am sure that this  camera produces an image, that is is better than one from a 35mm, but one quickly misses the control one is used to shooting manually with an SLR.  I bought this camera at the same time as a Pentax 6x7 medium format camera, and I find myself using this for almost everything because it is so much more convenient and portable.  And only in the case of images that would be over 20 inches on a side is the advantage of high resolution one that makes the Pentax a better choice.  For those serious about fine art landscapes and other photos with much detail, medium format film will still beat this camera or, probably any digital camera for detail.  But for less than poster-sized pictures under normal shooting conditions, it is hard to beat this camera.","I love my Nikon Coolpix 8700.  I have taken wonderful picture with this camera. But that is the great thing with digital film...DELETE and try again.  Please take several shots of the same subject to make sure you get the best one no matter what camera you use.<br />I guess all digital cameras have taken plenty of crummy pictures as well as good ones.<br />I won a photo contest using this camera and I was so happy.<br />The battery life is short so buy several batteries, if you plan on using it alot.  An get a 512 on up Compact Flash card.. 8 MEGA PIXELS uses lots of space on your smaller meg cards.<br /> I find all digital cameras, including this one, can take poor night time shots. Not all the time, though.  I've taken some good night shots.<br />You just have to practice with it.  I've taken wonderful shots of the moon when it is full with this.  You have to use night time landscape mode and a tripod.<br /><br />The LCD Screen pivots out and around so you can hold it up high over a croud or anything in the way like a camcorder. I love that.  However, the LCD screen is only 1.5 inches.<br /><br />The macro mode is just fine.  Keep back a bit from your subject.<br />If too close, you subject blurs.  But again, I've taken wonderful macro shots with this camera.<br /><br />If you buy one, you will like it just fine.  Read your manual to get all you can from all the wonderful functions.<br /><br />As of March 15, 2011..THIS CAMERA IS STILL WORKING!  Don't use it but to see if it turns on.  One of Nikon's best products!!!<br />I think I'll keep this camera forever!  I would hate to sell it!","Positive features:<br /><br />-Take great picutres<br /><br />-Auto focus work very well<br /><br />-Got a lot of features to offer<br /><br />Negative features:<br /><br />-Using 1G fast 80x recording speed compactflash still it pauses about 4 seconds to record the pic. when taking 8M pixels pic. Taking pic. less than 8M don't have this problem.<br /><br />-Flash is not powerful enough to take pic at night, need to get an external flash.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Having this camera since 2003 and still taking great pictures.  Note the bigger the len is, it allows more light into the camera, the better the pic. resolution.","After much consideration and review of Nikon's new, lower-priced DSLRs, I am purchasing another 8700 to replace my stolen (alas) 8700.  I have worked with Nikon's digital cameras for the last five years, consistently producing respectable photographs for use in lectures and as gifts for relatives.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Nikon's digital cameras (for instance, you have an older Coolpix model), the menu set-ups will be fairly easy to adapt to.  I do find the four side buttons on the camera to be a bit vexing--in moments of panic (\"There is an elephant walking towards the car\") one may forget exactly what has to be done with them.<br /><br />My only complaints about this camera are its low ISO, which means you often have to use a flash for indoor shots; and its lack of a manual focus ring for very low-light shots.<br /><br />The macro pictures are gorgeous, and the telephoto action shots I've gotten with it are clear, crisp, and blow up nicely to 16x20.  I chose this camera over a digital SLR not so much for the $200 to $300 savings as for the size.  It is small enough to fit in my handbag, which means that I can visit small villages in southern Africa without a big honking camera hanging off of my neck.  The preceeding camera was nicked by a dishonest handyman--not stolen from me on the street.  I know that some reviewers have mentioned durability problems, but I've had no trouble carrying it in my handbag and using it almost daily for eleven months.<br /><br />If you can't afford the DSLRs but need a high-quality camera now now, or if you want the convenience of a camera small enough to fit into a medium-sized handbag, this is the camera for you.","I bought this camera for my wife. She loves it. The crystal clear shots are unreal! There is a problem with distance and blurry pics as reported in other reviews, but this can be over came by learning to use shutter speed and other finite details. The  12 Macro settings are nice for when you want to just point and click as well as AUTO and programed features. One feature we have used quite a bit, is the 1.8 lcd screen that is  able to be moved and manipulated, it's great for looking over clift edges to take rock repelling photos","I had such high hopes with this camera purchase. I researched it for months, reading everything I could get my hands on, every website, magazine etc. All had glowing reviews of this camera and I'm not exactly negating them. I am, however, a bit peeved at the fact that this camera is not for low light/indoor situations at ALL. (My experience anyway).<br /><br />I have experimented \"8 ways 'till Sunday\", used every imaginable setting and without a tripod, it always blurs in lower lighting. If it's not blurring, it's casting an awful amber lighting across my images and all is lost.<br /><br />On the other hand, Macro shots are mind blowing, all my natural outdoor light shots are fantastic. The panoramic program is so wonderful! The clarity I have been able to get (around 65% of the time)is astounding. You can see people's poors and eyelashes the size of your little finger!<br /><br />Alas, the reading, the reading, the reading. I have had this almost 6 months now and I still have to refer to the darned manual...a LOT. And I also find myself Photoshopping for corrections (either blurring, color correction or SOMETHING).<br /><br />No it's not perfect, no it's not horrible. I have taken fabulous shots MUCH easier with my little Fuji FINEPIX 2 megapixle that have been more exciting than this thing.... but it does serve it's purpose. IF you can coax it into cooperating.<br /><br />So, finally... I'm searching for something else, but am not quite ready to hand this over just yet... I'm just mostly disappointed that this wasn't more user friendly and less... tempermental, so for this I am definatly middle of the road on this one.","I do mostly studio work, especially macro.  I was initially put off by the proprietary battery requirement for this camera, but I solved that problem with the purchase of the EH-53 AC adapter.  Be warned, though, any camera that requires a proprietary battery can pose problems for the tourist/traveler.  For such folks, I recommend a camera which takes good old AAs.<br /><br />In any case, the 8700 is not a tourist camera.  It has a tremendous amount of functionality which a tourist would not typically use, and few tourists have need of 8 MPX resolution.<br /><br />You can take this camera out of the box, set the dial to AUTO, and start taking pictures immediately.  But if that's your sole intent, this is not the camera for you. I consider the 8700 to be targeted toward the professionsl or serious amateur. I mention in passing that it took me almost a week to work my way through the user manual in order to make full use of this camera's functionality.","When i initially purchased my 8700 in 3/04 it was one of few consumer grade 8MPs available. I preferred it to other offerings because of its small form factor and light weight, however others seem to feel this lightweight contender is not a serious camera. I do lots of hiking and wanted something light and durable to travel with me from Patagonia peaks to Saharan sands. Unfortunately the saharan sands did the camera in. The multi-element zoom lens is not well sealed and easy to get blowing sand in the zoom mechanism. I have had a nightmare dealing with Nikon to get the camera repaired-$275 and been waiting 2.5 months and still no repaired camera.<br /><br />Few other peeves about the camera: The flash insists on popping up in low light even when disabled. Wish the time exposure bulb feature had a shutter lock and max exposure time is limited to 8s--I do lots of night photography. There is no direct way to attach filters without additional hood which then requires large and expenisive filters and still creeps into exposure area at wide angles. There are few accessories available and getting them from local Nikon resellers proved to be challenging. The battery life was dissapointing and required that I purchase 3 additional battery packs. Ergonomics and menu navigation could be much improved. I do primarily landscape photography and wish the camera was more biased towards wider angle lens.<br /><br />Given Nikon's slow turn around on the repair, I am now forced to buy another camera for upcoming trip. This time I am buying Olympus E-300 Digital SLR.","I haven't been as pleased by a camera in a long time.  The image quality is wonderful.<br />I might note that it takes time to learn the camera controls.<br />Although it is called a point and shoot, it exceeds that definition after becoming comfortable with it.  There is so much packed into the little body that one must know how to use and handle the controls and menus to get the prints that are desired.  Take your time, and you'll be delighted.<br />Oh. The low light problem only exists in auto mode.<br />Well, I ran into the apparently common problem of inserting the flash card incorrectly and breaking the camera.  This seems like a serious design flaw.","Hey all this is your die hard Sony lover SinMin here...Well I can't lie I broke down and bought the 8700 on a whim, to be honest it looked like a really cool little camera (which it is) and the shots I took at work ( if your new as a second job I sell cameras) were pretty good considering conditions.First thing you notice about this little powerhouse is it is set up completely different from its counterparts of the same class, wich brings me to one of the  reasons I gave it only 4 stars, this is a tough camera to use, by way of navigating the menus. Even a seasoned pro can easily find themselves lost! Even going thru the manual it will take you awhile to get a feel for the 8700 but once you do I can tell you the results are impressive!To start in a strange place the first thing I noticed is that compared to my beloved Sony F-828 the 8700 has much less ISO noise at 100 or 200, but it gets rather hairy at 400, however the pic's seemed to clean up better with the Nikon. Next that nice Nikon 8X zoom lens is sweet, it ain't a Ziess for sure but it is one of the better lenses I've used. Probably the biggest thing I love about this camera are the features. One thing I am always weary of (even on Sonys) are the so called scene modes, on the 8700 however they are deadbang on the money. I shot an incredible series of sunsets with the 8700's \"sunset mode\" and I swear the colors almost exploded out of the camera! And the \"panorama mode\" is too cool beyond words giving you the ability to create panoramic shots that are a full 360 degrees, and are all put together seamlessly with the included software! But the single reason why I initally bought the camera was for the \"bulb\" function. That is  a setting which will allow you to to create long exsposures ranging from 30 seconds to an eternal 10 minutes!! WOW! I do alot of slow shutter photography so this feature alone made the 8700 a must try. Now- there are a few other things that kept me from giving the 8700 5 stars, such as the placement of the zoom and power controls, more than once right after I got it I went to zoom in on something and I shut the damn thing off!! The controls and thier placement in general turned me off, however if your stubborn (and I am) you'll get used to them, and fall in love with this camera depite everything. Again controls aside, once you can navagate the menus and buttons this is a powerhouse of a picture taker! If not for the things I mentioned picture and color wise I rate it almost as high as the F-828, the Sony squeaks ahead by just a hair (Love that 4 color CCD!) other than that it is a camera I would strongly reccomend, but only to someone with prior digital camera experience and a basic working knowledge of photgraphy. This is by no means a point and shoot camera, but if your a greenhorn and presistant this could be your baby. As for the battery Its not bad but it ain't great. If you gonna use that \"blulb function at any length you better plug in the camera! The battery life is around 120-145 minutes to sony's 220-240. And the AC adapter is an extra you have to buy (BOO Nikon) A funny thing with this camera is the lens hood (another extra you'll have to buy) I believe in lens hoods but this thing is HUGE!!! I swear I laughed out loud when it ariived, but hey it works fine (even though it looks funny) and it makes a kickin stand for the camera in down time! The last thing and I could have overlooked everything else, my pet peeve about 8700 is the flash. While the flash works fine it is annoying beyond words! This is due to the fact that the AF light/sensor is located right next to it, so when you need AF but no flash the stupid thing pops up anyway! ARRRRRRRRGH!! The only way around it is to make sure the flash is set to off before you make your shot. When I bought the 8700 I also got a great deal on its succesor the 8800, I bought both and figured I'd return the one I liked least...I kept both! The 8700 is a tricky tempramental little power house, if you give yourself the time to feel it out you will love it but like my baby the 828 the 8700 will make you work for those good shots, and bleed for the great ones. Check out the 8800 (and my review) I also reccomend the Sony F-828 and even though it has far less zoom ability the Sony DSC-V3. The 8700 is compact but can hold its own with the best of them! Could this be love!? Happy shooting and thanks for reading!","Ok, this isn't one of my usual hands-on reviews.  I ain't got the kind of money to buy all these cameras and test them.  But I wanted to give potential buyers some help...<br /><br />Should you consider an SLR-type EVF (electronic viewfinder) digital camera or an interchangeable-lens digital SLR for serious photography?  I faced this question and agonized over it for months.  I wish I had come across this brief and very helpful article by Popular Photography Magazine (I'm not affiliated with them in any way):<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The article compares five current-model EVF cameras: Canon PowerShot Pro 1, Konica-Minolta Dimage A2, Nikon Coolpix 8700, Olympus Camedia C-8080, and Sony Cybershot DSC-F828.  It's a very easy read, and at the end the writers give you a helpful checklist for the EVF vs. d-SLR decision.<br /><br />As for myself, I'm going with a d-SLR since I want 1) high-quality lens, 2) lens choices, 3) little to no shutter lag, and 4) accessory choices.  Good luck!","This camera is the best camera in its price range, hands down.<br /><br />I also have the 5700 (which is now my wife's camera), and this camera solves the several small issues I had with that model.<br /><br />First, the resolution.  At 8 megapixels, you can blow up the photos to an enourmous 20x30 inches.  If you are going to shoot photos at the full resolution though, I recommend getting the largest CF card you can afford...  Otherwise you will feel compelled to shoot at a lower resolution or crank up the compression, totally negating the benefit of having so many pixels.<br /><br />Second, the lens.  It has an excellent range for everyday shooting, and has the most incredible macro lens capability I have ever seen on a fixed lens photo.  I have taken pictures of small bugs buzzing around and landing on flowers, from about 2 inches away, and they come out beautifully.  My 5700 lens seemed to 'pincushin' the image a little bit, but I have not seen this with the 8700.<br /><br />Third, the size.  This is a nice compact camera.  I *also* have a Nikon D100 with several lenses, but for routine travel, I use this camera just because it is so convenient to carry around.<br /><br />Even though it is a 'fixed lens' camera, there are some add-ons for wide-angle and tele-photo...  If you think you would regret getting a fixed lens over an SLR, these options may satisfy the urge to get 'just a little closer' or 'just a little bigger'.<br /><br />In general, non-slr digital cameras have a slight delay between the clicking of the button and the snapping of the picture.  For nature/landscape and posed photography this isn't a big deal... but for action shots, you have to be a little 'predictive' with your shooting finger.  The 8700 is quicker than the 5700 in this regard.<br /><br />If I have one complaint about this camera, it is the photos it takes in low-light.  Low light photos are dim with low contrast, and the built-in flash does not look 'natural'.  I really haven't found a camera that does low-light well though, and in general built-in flashes are never that great, so I can't hold that against this camera more than any other.","This camera produces photos that are just magnificent, I have been around photography for a long time, and I have never seen anything produce photos that come near this camera.<br /><br />Everyone I know is uhhhing and ahhhhhing, have given some prints to friends, they have had them framed and hung.  I am sort of pround of this, me and the Nikon 8700.<br /><br />I honestly feel that no photo lab using film could be this good.<br /><br />The camera out of the box in full auto mode, produces very acceptable photos, but to my eyes a bit overexposed, I never use this mode, usually in program or aperture preferred, and stop down between .3 to .7 stops, results, great.<br /><br />With all the good things nothing is perfect, I never track or shoot sports, so this is no problem to me.<br /><br />Whats annoyed me most is a the awful instruction manual, this coupled with multilayered and complex controls can be very frustrating, but after you use it for a while, its no big thing, but at the beginning, its a pain.<br /><br />Summing it all up, in my opinion, this is the finest camera I,ve ever owned","I upgraded from the Coolpix 5700 in order to take pix in low light situations, something the 5700 completely fails at. Surprise! This is a wholly new camera, though it shares the same body as the 5700. New firmware [ver. 1.2] means everything is much faster, battery life is longer, plus resolution is higher, LCD is brighter, etc. The AF assist light is wonderful, as is the close-up capability. Image quality and color is simply amazing! You'll need several batteries, a charger, and BIG Compact Flash cards [at least 512 meg].<br /><br />Every October 1st Nikon updates their line [the newest version is the Coolpix 8800 with even more zoom and also an image stabilizer], so the 8700 is a TERRIFIC buy now. I own three Nikon 35mm cameras, two Canons, a Pentax 6 x 7 mid-format, a Coolpix 5700 and the 8700. Soon I will own only the Pentax and the 8700; both are ENORMOUSLY capable cameras, with the Pentax yielding incredible color transparencies and the Nikon 8700 extraordinary prints.<br /><br />Like the 5700 the controls on the 8700 are multi-layered and a lot of study of the poorly-written manual is required, but study pays. The range of capabilities is stunning, but the menus are complex. There's little this tough, handy camera doesn't do extremely well. This is one TERRIFIC camera!","My first venture into digital after a lifetime of Nikon SLRs. Very nice camera with a few drawbacks.  Still has the digital \"buffer' lag which makes it useless for action photos. Built in flash is a joke so plan on using a speedlight. Control buttons along side the camera are easy to accidently press.<br /><br />However, very light, good optics.  Makes a great \"travel\" camera.","I bought an 8700 from a local dealer.  It works.  It takes great pictures.  That's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news is that when trying to order accessories, one hits a giant wall of whipped cream -- you push on it and your arms get real sticky, but the wall is still there.  Calls to Melville get you to tech support, who deny everything.  Their reputation on the net is \"customer support is terrible.\"  The company just doesn't give a poop.  Lord help me if anything breaks.<br /><br />So, the rate is 3 stars.  Great camera, but the company doesn't care after the sale.","This is an excellent camera which takes photos as sharp as any 35mm slr.  Besides this camera, I have a Nikon N90s and N70 35mm camera bodies and assorted Nikon lenses for these cameras.  I also have a Pentax 6 X 7 medium format camera with three Pentax lenses.  I graduated from the Navy Schools of Photography in Pensacola and became an official Navy photograper.  Since that time (many moons ago!) I have kept up with the profession.  I purchased the Coolpix 8700 two months ago and have been VERY satisfied with the results I get!  The only imperfection I've noticed is that the lens has a moderate amount of what photographers call \"barrel distortion\" when used at the wider angle settings (straight lines curve very slightly away from center) The real down side... the shutter lag time is over one second from the time you press the shutter release button b4 the camera records the image.  Digital is not the way to go for any sports type photography where timing is critical unless you are prepared to spend over $4,000 dollars for a digital slr pro body. I have not had any problems with the bluish cast a previous reviewer mentioned.  Lens flare is all but non existant with the ED glass element Nikon uses in the lens.  I do notice a very slight color shift to magenta when I load photos from Nikonviewer (software which comes with this camera) to Photoshop.  When I print directly from Nikonviewer, OR print from Photoshop without changing the color balance, the colors are virtually perfect. I know that Nikon included a note with this camera which says to download the software update, which corrects color problems when converting raw files in nikonview.  So that may be the problem with the results mentioned in the previous review.  This camera feels good to hold.  Overall an excellent camera!!!","This camera is well made and capable of creating very high quality images, if you take the time to learn to use it.  Some of its functions are less than intuitive, but it will reward your time spent with the manual with professional quality images.  In particular, the metering, white balance and macro capabilities are pro-quality.  However, due to shutter lag, this isn't a good choice for shooting sports.  The 8 megapixel resolution lets you make 13X19 inch prints or larger that are photo quality.  Using a tripod will also pay off with razor sharp close ups and excellent color saturation. This is a wonderful camera for portraits, scenics, and especially close up shots,where the fold out, tilting LCD screen really can be helpful in getting unique angles on your subject.  This camera also allows you to use many of Nikons Speedlights (electronic flashes) to get the light on your subject when it is too far for the built in flash.  This is a very flexible and capable machine. I do recommend getting a second battery and the lens hood to eliminate lens flare under most conditions. I highly recommend this camera to those who choose not to go with a digital SLR.  It is the next best thing and it is MUCH more portable and flexible.","I bought this camera as a replacement for 5700.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />* Well built;<br /><br />* Smallest 8MP camera on the market;<br /><br />* Excellent image quality;<br /><br />* Battery life has much improved vs. 5700 (although I would still buy a spare battery);<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />* Steep learning curve;<br /><br />* Autofocus is not great, especially in low light. New AF assist light didn't make much difference for me;<br /><br />* Manual focus is very cumbersome to use;<br /><br />* There is noticeable noise in images taken above ISO 100. (This is a new problem for 8700);<br /><br />Overall, if you want 8MP in a small package, you can't beat this camera. I highly recommend it.","Okay, I tested all the 8MP out there and so far this is the one I have to say is the best. It is a little bit harder to get used too, but believe me. Once you get the hang of it, there is no going wrong. I do recommend getting the fastest memory card there is. I am shooting \"raw images\" and the faster the card the faster you get the picture. It is a NIKON.","Dont misunderstand, this is no dought a wonderful Camera, but I have to compare these Images to My Sony 5meg all the time and this camera is just not as easy and doesnt take photos of people as well. I have studied the Manual since day one, and have taken over a thousand pics...The Sony has Very rich fleshtones, Nikon is Blue, thats the only way I can describe it, I have to Import alot of the images into photoshop to get rid of the Blueish cast, probably my fault and need to study the book more but why should I have to?..The Sony has much better AUTO features, and way better focusing abilities...I bought this camera because of the power and size of the lens...It will fit through a chain link fence, where as the Sony will not, and I am constantly behind fences at sporting events, The Size of the Sony 8meg was just too big to throw into my pack, the Nikon is easier to carry and has an unbelievable lens range for a camera of this size...35-280 is the best of the bunch in the 8meg range...So..my humble opinion, if you want a compact 8meg...this camera is a good tool, just be ready to study and practice with it...If you want 8megs and an easy auto camera, with better focus and much better pictures of people then get the Sony8meg...This Nikon has frustrated me from day one and I am pretty good at photography...I own six digital cameras and this is my first Nikon...Nikon does have an incredible range of accesories for this camera and it is a keeper, I will just have to keep practicing with it and try to figure out why the Hue seems too blue for me...It takes incredible photos of landscapes and the outdoor shots are wonderfull, the lens range is worth keeping it alone...It is so much smaller than my Sony F717...8megs is better for printing 13x19 high quality...No pixelation with my Canon S9000...So...Nikon=serious tool and learning curve....Sony=Auto mode point and shoot with not much study/practice...I now own both so I know...If you aint gonna practice with the Nikon then Get the Sony 8meg or 5meg...Hope this is helpful...cause these are thousand dollar choices.","I upgraded to a Coolpix 8700 from a old Kodak DX3500, now my kodak took wonderful pictures, and continued to amaze me. But after download the first pictures I took with this camera in their eye popping glory I was caught, hook, line, sinker.<br />While this camera is perfect for an amateur aspiring professional it would probably be lacking to any real professional, and I plan to compliment it with a 35mm SLR.<br />The learning curve on this camera can be quite high, with alot of features and buttons to learn, but after a few hours of playing I managed to get most of the features down. The button layout is also nicely placed, I find it easy to navigate the buttons by touch while using the view finder.<br />But why talk when you can show! Here are some pictures I took the day I received this camera not 20 minutes after the battery finished charging! No special lighting, in fact it was overcast and raining and sorta dark the day these were taken. (...)Simply amazing! (...)","This is Nikon's upgrade from the excellent Coolpix 5700, and it is a truly excellent piece of engineering.  If I were in the market for a digital SLR with a fixed-lens, this would easily be my choice.  Cameras such as this one illustrate convincingly that film is all but dead for serious photographers.  This camera's 8 megapixel resolution will produce stunning images that the user can view at once, without the hassle of the processing lab.<br />The 8X optical zoom lens on this camera seems excellent both for portrait shots, landscapes, and nature shots, and only professionals or very serious amateurs will miss the ability to switch between lenses.  The pictures I took were sharp and bright.  Make no mistake, this camera produces excellent images.<br />Finally, Nikon put an AF-assist on a prosumer-grade camera.  This is a significant improvement over the excellent Coolpix 5700, the predecessor to this camera.  The buffer is bigger too, allowing the user to take more shots before the camera has to write to the CF card.<br />With this camera, the photographer can take a large number of digital photographs, upload to one's personal computer, and either print out pro-grade prints with an inexpensive printer (OK, the ink cartridges aren't that cheap but the printers are) or email the photos to any of several processing labs, who will mail you your prints in a day or so.  Or, you can do it the old-fashioned way, and take your images to a processing lab and download the images there for printing, similar to dropping off a roll of film in the old days.  You can do this AFTER you pick only the pix you want to keep--one of digital's many and major advantages over film.  Further, Nikon's Capture 4 program, or Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements gives us a \"digital darkroom\" that is more powerful than what pros can do in a $20,000 chemical film darkroom.  With just a moderately powerful personal computer.  The digital darkroom has truly arrived.<br />Ergonomically, I really like the size and layout of this camera.  It is significantly smaller than the interchangeable-lens SLRs, although this is no pocket camera.  It has a wonderful quality feel to it--the user knows immediately that this is a world-class precision instrument.  I found the camera to be a joy to handle and use.  The pictures are commensurate.<br />The main issue with this camera is one of choice and preference: do you spend the money for this camera, with its excellent fixed zoom lens, or do you opt for a full SLR digital camera such as Nikon's D70, D100, or other comparable cameras that allow one to use the full line of autofocus lenses.  This camera costs almost as much as these semi-professional grade SLRs, so the buyer should think about this before buying.<br />This is an excellent upgrade over the superb Coolpix 5700 and users will enjoy taking excellent images with this precision instrument.","This is the coolest thing I have ever owned. It is my precious (haha). I found it online for $762, and it is worth every penny. Can be operated simply enough for a point-and-shooter in the default auto mode (remove lens cap, turn from \"off\" to \"on\", aim, compose, fire). The high resolution captures incredible detail and the zoom range is amazing. Even without delving into the camera's vast array of creative controls, it produces images far superior to other cameras I have used. Complaints of complexity are ridiculous. This camera will serve you well if you never even bother to crack the manual.<br />If I could think of a photographic ability this camera lacks, I would list it. Master its features over time, and have fun in the meantime.<br />I recommend Lexar's 40x CF cards, as this baby generates pretty sizable files. Pick up an EH-53 AC Adapter as well (a whopping $17.99 here on Amazon--a steal!).<br />My 35mm SLR is getting very lonely....","I have one for about a week, I have got high quality pictures with this camera.  This is a preliminary review, so that's why I'am giving it 4 stars in advance.  I will update this review later on.  Get another battery, because you will need it.","The Nikon Coolpix 8700 is an upgrade of the 5700, using the same magnesium alloy chassis, with some significant changes. Of course, the biggest change is the the growth from 5 to 8 megapixels. On a practical level, this means that flawless 16x20 prints are now a reality for advanced amateur digital photo enthusiasts. I've heard a claim that 20x30\" prints can be made from 8 MP cameras, but I have yet to try that large a print.  Other changes are 1) A significantly better LCD that is both bigger and brighter, 2) A gorgeous viewfinder that is crisp and finely detailed (a real improvement here!), 3)Easier menus that ironically provide even more choices, 4) A focus assist light, 5) Optional composition assist lines that can be switched on and off, 6) A faster start-up time, and 7) A memo recording mode.<br />A niggling omission that I've wished Nikon would incorporate into their high end Coolpix's is a 35mm style manual focus ring.  Why they don't do this I don't know, but can only suppose it's because the lens tube and elements are much more delicate than on a 35mm lens and they don't want people torquing on it.<br />The camera company where I bought the 8700 (in Porland, Oregon) recommended the Coolpix 8700 over the Sony, the Konica/Minolta A2 and the upcoming Canon Powershot Pro 1. Part of the reason was the full line of accessories, like the eminently useful vertical grip/battery pack.  I recommend this and the filter adapter for anyone purchasing this camera.<br />The Nikon Coolpix 8700 is a great upgrade to an already terrific camera.  Because I wanted to be able to print 16x20, I made the switch from the 5700.  The other enhancements also make it worthwhile, albeit expensive, to make the upgrade."]},{"name":"Nikon D70","amazon_reviews":["I have several Nikon cameras, but I find myself going back to the D-70 for shooting nite time photos, for sports.Some will question this, but  I have found something and will be unable to make public, but believe me its a great nite time camera.I called Nikon and ask about what I had found, and even the top people did not know this.Again a \"GREAT\" camera.","PERFECT condition :D forgot to leave feedback way back when, but still works great!

Great price and great performance so far.","I gave it as a gift to a freshman art major.","As described.","Very pleased with this purchase.","This D70 was a steal, and was actually a lot more than I expected after reading the users description. It came with everything listed, plus the battery charger and battery. The only thing I needed to get was a card. The camera body itself was in excellent condition and may as well have been a refurb. I have found no issues with it other than a barely noticeable missing port cover on the lower left side. It looks great and works great despite its age. Not bad at all for the price I paid.<br />The D70 itself is a lower mid-range Nikon consumer DSLR, The rough equivalent to Nikon's current D7000 series. The control scheme is very easy to pick up and should be familiar to anyone who has used a Nikon DSLR before, minus a few scheme changes compared to newer models. This camera packs a punch despite its age, producing striking pictures with very pleasant saturation. Don't let the lower resolution scare you, because all of that is made up for in the straight up quality of the camera.<br />I only have two notable issues with the model itself. Unless your working with a fairly low f-stop lens, don't expect to be using this for any high action low light scenarios or otherwise. Without any sort of external boosting, the maximum ISO is 1600 ASA, and at that, the grain isn't \"fine\" whatsoever. Fine grain begins to drop off between 640~800 with the D70. If in a low lit area, color grain becomes very strong by 800~1000, and just gets worse from there. Other than that, this cameras metering is a little wonky. While I normally shoot in manual, when I just want to take a back seat to my camera, I will set it to aperture priority. This camera likes to overexpose its metered shots a lot. I constantly find myself playing with exposure compensation, changing it to anywhere between -0.3 to -1.7. Especially in an area where lighting is constantly changing, you will find yourself changing to exposure compensation just as much as you'd be playing with settings on manual, completely defeating the purpose of the metered modes.<br />Nevertheless, beautiful camera sold a a great price.","Wonderful camera!! It's my first DSLR and I really liked it. It doesn't come with a tutorial or instructions, but you can download them online, or watch video tutorials on youtube. It takes great photos and is working wonderfully for my college courses.","I sy glad, best picture","It's a D 70, not the flashiest camera in the world, it's beauty is its reasonably rugged simplicity. It harkens back to the Nikon F-4, great feel, makes sense, and pretty tough. I abused my old D 70  for nearly 10 years before it started to act up. I've had other makes and models, some are pretty nice machines, the D 70 won't let you down when it matters most, it's why I bought another one.","Came with everything I needed. As a professional, I appreciate the quick delivery and excellent care in wrapping. Worked great right out of the box.","Bought this used, which always worries me, but the camera looked (and was packed) like a new unit. I now own 4 of these cameras that I use for every day photographs, this one is a winner.","When my old Nikon N70 film camera died - for the second time - the digital age was upon us. Through the years my lenses and external flash laid in my old gadget bag doing nothing.  And then I saw this D70, and I wondered.  Will it work with my old lenses?  So I ordered  one at a fraction of the price for newer DSLRs.  The camera came in near perfect condition with brand new battery and charger.  It is an older model DSLR, but is has a slew of advanced functions.  If you are upgrading from a point-and-shoot camera, this is an economical way to get into a DSLR.  Check out the Nikon website for videos on the D90, which is quite similar to the D70, for an introduction to the many features and get up to speed for using either camera.","I have had this camera before and loved it..I saw this and for the price I had to to buy it back.It does do some very nice pictures.","Everything was perfect","Was a little freaked when it came in a soft pack but it was like an egg in a ball of bubble wrap and it was fine. Camera works great, all accessories promised were included! Hap-pay, hap-pay, hap-pay!!!!!","Nice","At the time the price was right for the D70 to be used as MY FIRST DSLR camera.  It was used, but new to me.  I have a cousin that had this camera for years and she raved about it when I mentioned wanting to learn photography...so I bought it.  It helped that we had the same camera so when I called to ask questions \"why did this happen\", \"how to I do this\", she told me what and where to go to change a setting, etc.  I can't tell you how much I learned with this camera!!!  I had the D70 for about a year before I upgraded to a different Nikon.  I am SO happy I got it and that it helped me to grow with my new hobby that I love.","nk you for the camera.

I bought one for my girlfriend and wish i had gotten myself one as a back up camera! if your new to the D70 make sure to get you a compact-flash memory card! this does not take an SD card as i ignorantly thought","I bought this with the money I got for doing my first gig (wedding) I wanted to have something to remember my first gig as a photographer. Its sweet. Its a stripped down version of the newer cameras. who the hell needs 9 fps and 32 mp anyways? I like the basics. Its not what you use, its how you use what you got.","I bought this camera for a trip to the Bahamas. Even though it is nearly 10 years old, It still can compete in my eyes. Images are 6MP, and for today's standards that is very low, however, the metering, as well as image quality is still fantastic to this day. Easy to use, and with firmware 2.0 uses modern CF cards.","Takes great pictures and does not have any issues that I have come across. My Nikon 35mm lens works very well with it. It is heavy and sturdy. For the price I am very pleased with it.","Great quality images and easy to handle for someone with beginning knowledge in photography.  We purchased this for our 12 year old daughter and she is ecstatic to start learning :)","I have had my Nikon D70 for just over 4 years now, and yes it is my first digital camera.  Yes I still shoot film.  Just yesterday I shot 9+ hours with this camera on one battery!  My wife's D3100, dead after 7 hours.  My sister in law's Cannon Rebel, dead after 7.5 hours.  I was still shooting.  This camera is a work horse.  Drop it, smack it, treat it like a Nikon, it can handle it.  It does not have all the bells and whistles of the newer models.  It only shoots 1.5 frames a second.  It's review screen is really small.  It only takes CF cards. It is heavy, which I like.  The ISO only goes up to 1600.  It processes photos really slow.  So for all the negatives, I still love it.  When I upgrade, I want to keep it as a back up or for someone who wants to get into photography.","I bought this camera a few weeks ago with the intention of using it as my backup/\"uh-oh\" camera, one that I could break and not really care too much about. The quality is decent, it does appear grainy depending on the light conditions outside. I did a small shoot recently when there was about half a foot of snow on the ground and a slight overcast and there was still a noticeable amount of grain (at least to me, friends can't tell).<br /><br />As I said in the title, it's great for beginners. It offers a lot for new photographers, all the manual settings, the auto-focus motor in the camera makes it great for lenses that don't have it built in. The 6.1 or whatever MP gets outdone by newer point and shoots, but for what it is it's a great camera.<br /><br />I'd recommend this as a backup or a starter camera.","The shipping said that it would come in about 8 days or so and it came in literally 2 days, I was really shocked about that because I was just patiently waiting. I am very pleased for the quality I've gotten at the price. And I emailed the person who sold me the item, he was very polite and answered anything I needed. My first DSLR and I cant wait to use it !","I bought this used, not realizing it was an older model.  Works fine, just took me a trip to six or seven stores before finding a replacement memory card that came with it and was faulty (at least I know where to get more).  Not a problem.  Needed one with more memory anyway.  The camera arrived 3-4 days earlier than I anticipated, which I appreciate, in it's original box with all attachments and instructions.  There isn't a scratch or knick on this expertly cared for camera.  I bought it so I could take action photos at baseball games, etc., and the one time i tried it, i found i have a lot to learn, but that the camera, when used properly takes amazing photos.<br /><br />When I informed the seller the memory card was defective, he offered to send me a replacement.  He was very helpful and I appreciate his efforts to ensure I was happy with the camera.  Considering how much I paid (about 1/3 of the price of a new one), i can run and buy my own new memory card, but the offer of a replacement was telling, and I thank him for that.","Super excited to buy my dream camera. Older model, but it's what i wanted. Had a problem with the view finder during transit, but the vendor made it right with me. Doesn't affect the great quality pictures. Would do business with this vendor again...","I've been away from photography for a long time. I got the bug again after entering some images into a company Art in the Workplace program. My entries were from 15 years ago, when I had a film darkroom. Lucky, one of my images was selected to be shown. So I started. That was enough for me to get the bug again. So I started looking. I considered another film camera when a friend recommended looking at a slightly older DSLR. In terms of lens compatibility, the D70 seems to live at the sweet spot.<br /><br />I found one here on Amazon for the amazing price of $244.00. I had some doubts as to the overall quality of a $200ish DSLR camera. But boy was I wrong! The camera arrived in nearly pristine condition. The camera is (after some time with the manual) easy to use. The controls are smartly located and make since. The body feels very secure with a great hand grip. I bought a Nikon 18-70 AF-S DX lens online for $140.00. I am wanting for it to arrive. In the meantime, I am borrowing a Nikon 18-105 AF-S DX VR lens. So, my out of pocket is $380.00 for a camera that once sold for approx $1200.00?? I am cool with that.<br /><br />Again, I am pleasantly surprised at the smoothness of the camera and the optics. Yes, the camera is only 6 megapixels, but that does not matter too much (at least to me). I think the quality of the images I am getting from this camera is simply amazing. For the price I paid for this camera, you could say that this is an entry level camera, but at one point this was one of Nikon's med level products. I believe currently, D70s are only available used.<br /><br />I recommend one of these to anyone who wants a really great DSLR camera without spending large sums of money. With the money you save on the camera, you can buy yourself a nice lens and have a camera worthy of the Nikon name and reputation.","For anyone wanting to start using Digital SLRs this is a great product! It is easy to use, the quality is perfect and it weighs much less than other SLRs. You could go for a newer item with more updated features, but you will pay more. If you are a pro on a budget or a beginner wanting to learn then this product is great for you.","I have been a Canon user for about three years now. My Canon Xti has not let me down yet. I kept hearing and reading all these good reviews on Nikon DSLRS. I originally was going to get a Nikon, but for some reason didn't. Anyways, after reading, i decided just to take a chance with one. I was recommended the d70 or d50 as a starter Nikon. I just bought a used Nikon body(wonderful condition BTW) just in case i really didn't like it. The first i noticed when i took the camera out was the Body's size. Comparing to my Canon XTI, the body is larger, but feels much stronger and better made. I actually don't shake as much when i hold the Nikon compared to the Canon. When it's comes to the battery life, it seems very well. As for options and functions, it's laid out very well, and not diffcult to use. The screen is a good bit smaller than my Canon, but that is ok. I'm getting use to it. Now, as for the white balance, the Nikon takes the cake. Canons are more on the warm white balance and if you want to make it normal/neutral, you sometimes have to set a custom white balance(Especially indoors). I didn't have to do that with the Nikon yet. I just set it to whatever correct white balance and it's pretty accurate. That's a plus. The colors are very nice too, but i'll be able to fully tell as time goes. I read a couple of negatives that i may be able to help out with: I read there is a blueish tint when taking pics indoors with the flash. This is probably because you have the wrong white balance set. Also i read the light meter is off. This is true, but as another reviewer stated, \"Read the book and you'll understand it better.\" I think some people need to understand their cameras better before just posting negative statments about it. Overall, The d70 is a nice camera and i hope to enjoy it more as time moves along.","It is easy to use.  Believe it or not this is my back up camera to my Nikon N90s 35mm.  It does everything the way its supposed to and does it without a problem.  I bought it used this year in June.  This is my first digital SLR.  It isn't the best and I knew that when I bought it.  I have no complaints.  It is just a simple pro-sumer camera.  I'd buy again.","i had one of these: the d70 kit. i still have the 18-70mm lens from the kit but retired and sold the body. it was a wonderful companion. fast, incredible battery life, super quality images. the only camera better than this beast is the body that replaced it: a d80.","The D70, especially since the d70s came out, is a bargain. I bought the D70 and upgraded the firmware (easy - see nikon website) and now have a D70s sans the .2 inch larger screen on the back.<br />I used to do freelance work and have boxes of nikon accessories to play with so I just bought the body. Only complaint? These new D-series cameras don't seem to like the old flash units. Oh, and when will Nikon go full frame so we don't have to deal with these small-sensor lens (or the conversion factor) and use our old proper film ones. Alas.<br /><br />Otherwise the D70 is perfect...<br />Light weight. Depth of field preview. Grid in the viewfinder. Instant on. Fast processing. The new built-in wireless \"commander-mode\" with the new flashes.<br />This camera is a joy to use.","My first DSLR was a Nikon D100. The D100 was a marvel at the time, one of the first affordable DSLRs, but when the D70 came out, I bought one. The D70 is the camera that the D100 should have been, with much improved placement of controls, and menus that were much improved in appearance (after a firmware upgrade). I've taken several thousand photos with the D70, and some of them have won contests with nice prizes. For the current price, I doubt if there's a better bargain to be had.<br /><br />I recently bought a Nikon D200, but I'll definitely keep my D70 for a backup.","I've been a \"prosumer\" for many years, and was always frustrated that as much as I might try I couldn't make photos like Galen Rowell or those found in Outdoor Photography.  I tried using Velvia, took classes, all the rest.  Now, with the D70, I think I can pictures I can be proud of.  And perhaps more importantly, that my wife likes.<br /><br />I'm just finishing a trip to France and I'm delighted with the D70.  It's various automatic modes work great and really, my photos look fantastic.  As a friend suggested, I always use the highest-resolution offered so that later I can crop as needed, and the slowest ISO speed.  Down in Paris' catacombs I took great free-handed photos in the near-darkness by increasing the \"film speed\" to 1600.  How'd you like to try that with film?<br /><br />The other VERY great thing is the battery.  I've had a CoolPix 900 and found myself having to carry a bandolier of batteries; it seemed like they needed changing about every ten photos.  The D70 just seems to go on forever.  Since the time I bought it (in late November) and first charged it, I've had to re-charge once.  That's it.<br /><br />So it you've got an investment in Nikon lenses and want to leverage that investment, the D70's a great opportunity.  At least for now it's everything I've always wanted.","Many of my best shots have been with this camera and I find it fast when taking consecutive photos. Colors are average while manual functions are tedious.. This camera is quite bulky for travelling but gives you good shots. I recommend having a professional SLR camera together with a compact camera like FUJI F10. The colors and clarity of the pictures of the 6 MP FUJI are superb to the Nikon D70, not to mention the feather weight of it.","I shopped around a lot, and couldn't find a comparable camera for this price. It has full-featured Auto mode and all the manual control you'd want at the same time - a must get.","The D70 is the digital SLR to record daily life and life events. With a 6 megapixel resolution limits the size of prints you can make with it to about 11\" by 17\". If this is not a problem for you then this is your digital camera. If you want to be able to make larger prints with good resolution, then you need to spend a great deal more money for a higher resolution digital camera (about $5,000) or stick with film. I keep my old N90 for these purposes.<br /><br />Buy the D70 without the bundled 18-70 Nikon lens if (1) you already have a bundle of Nikon lenses; or (2) if you want a more capable first lens for your camera. If you want a more capable lens I strongly recommend the Nikon 24-120 lens. It cost $500 from B&H photo and will wind up being the lens you always keep on your camera. Its equivalent range in film cameras is 36-180 - in other words slight wide angle to more than satisfactory telephoto. This is the fourth generation of this lens by Nikon and it now has all the bells and whistles: Nikons best ed glass for super sharp and clear pictures, silent wave motor for extremely fast focusing, and vibration reduction to eliminate the shakes in low light. Nikon has other excellent zooms and you may want to look at them but I can highly recommend this lens as one to have if you never want to miss a shot of the kids or what is happening at the instant.<br /><br />The D70 comes bundled with one EN-EL3 battery. To get started with the camera I suggest the following in addition:<br /><br />* One extra EN-EL3 Lithium-Ion Battery.<br /><br />* Two 2GB 80X CompactFlash cards with write acceleration (WA) technology.<br /><br />* One CF card reader for your computer. Firewire or USB connection depending upon your needs.<br /><br />As time and money permit you may want to add the following:<br /><br />* A telephoto lens for wildlife and sporting events. The 70-300mm F4-5.6G AF Nikon is a great value and complements the bundled lens nicely. If money is not an object step up to the 70-300ED or the 70-200 F2.8 with vibration reduction.<br /><br />* A good macro lens such as the AF Micro Nikon 105mm f2.8.<br /><br />* Polarizing filters for both your basic lens and the telephoto. Get Nikon filters there is no sense in spending money for Nikon lenses and then putting junk filters on them.<br /><br />* A bag to carry all this stuff.<br /><br />This will get you nicely started. Further down the line you may wish to get the following:<br /><br />* A speedlight. Either the SB 600 or 800.<br /><br />* A tripod and ballhead.<br /><br />Be sure to check prices at B&H Photo as well as those shown here. They have a tremendous selection and have long been known and trusted by serious photographers. In addition I would suggest that anyone who buys a D70 join Nikonians. There or literally tens of thousands of people who are more than happy to help you with any question you may have about Nikon Cameras, lenses and other equipment as well as help you with your photography skills. And, bet of all, it's free! Go to nikonians.org.","I've been a Nikon owner for 15 years now and finally made the change to digital.  I love everything about the camera...except for the limited use of the older flashes.  I have a SB24 flash that was a wonderful flash for the film cameras, but it is of limited use now with the D70.  But I guess that's to be expected to keep moving forward.  I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a DSLR whether they have Nikon lenses or not.","This is a good camera. The only real complaint is the lack of raw jpeg or tiff storage (you can store raw or compressed jpeg only)<br /><br />That means a lot of dark room work, or a lot a reduction in printable size. ISO Range is also limited to 200 in the lower end.<br /><br />A word of caution. When you see this camera selling for new at a price that is significantly below what the Amazon vendor Adorama offers (A reputable lower prices kind of firm) be very cautious.<br /><br />There are a lot of scams where they offer you a ridiculously low price ($500) for new camera but only if you contact them first. Then they try and upsell you and if you dont buy a bunch of over priced very expensive garbage they cancel your order, but then they have you credit info.<br /><br />[...]look at Genius Cameras to get a good idea of how this works.<br /><br />Good luck, great camera.","Sometimes it won't let me take a picture. I finally figured out why - different focusing systems are very particular. Read the manual chapter on focusing. You'll learn about its different modes and each mode's requirements.<br /><br />I've owned the D70 since the first day it was available in the U.S. of A. It's a great camera with too many features to ever use. Oh yea, that's because its Japanese!","This camera is awesome! I have a Nikon N80 35mm film camera and the D70 is basically a digital version of the N80.  They look and perform in very similar manners.  The D70 is slightly taller and heavier than the N80, though.  I do want to warn people that digital photography with a D-SLR is different than film photography with a 35mm SLR.  It takes practice and a little time to get used to it.  But once you do you'll love it!<br /><br />The D70 has pretty much everything a digital SLR needs.  It takes exceptionally sharp pictures with the 6.1 MP sensor.  The rechargeable battery lasts forever.  So far I've taken about 200 pictures (some with flash, some without), reviewed the pics on the LCD and experimented with various menu functions and the battery meter hasn't gone down any yet.<br /><br />The menu on the D70 is expansive.  It has all kinds of customizations to make the camera fit your personal preferences (Like which control knob changes aperture or shutter speed, bracketing order, self timer length, etc).  The camera also includes many white balance settings and adjustments like vivid, saturation, contrast, etc.<br /><br />The camera can take pictures in 5 different options: NEF(RAW), JPEG fine, JPEG Normal, JEPG Basic and NEF+JPEG Basic.  And the pictures can be taken in 3 sizes: L (3,008x 2000), M (2,240x 1,488) and S (1,504x 1,000).<br /><br />The D70 has a very fast write time to the memory card.  Plus it has a memory buffer which lets you continue taking pictures even while the camera is writing to the card.  Because of this I would recommend saving some money by buying a basic type memory card.  I don't think you really need a \"high speed\" card.  When I was testing out my camera, with a basic card, I was able to take 7-8 JPEG Fine pictures in about 3-4 seconds before the camera's buffer filled up (as soon as a picture is written to the card the buffer frees up space and so you can continue to take pictures but the picture taking rate slows down, maybe 1/sec. instead of 3/sec.)<br /><br />The viewfinder is very clear and has a bar at the bottom that tells you shutter speed, aperture, metering numbers, etc.  You can elect to add horizontal and vertical lines to the viewfinder as one of your custom settings.  I would recommend doing this since it helps you keep things leveled up.<br /><br />Auto focus is fast and pretty accurate most of the time. Of course you need AF lenses to utilize this feature.  There is really no \"shutter lag.\"  As soon as you push the shutter button the camera takes the picture.  Also, there is no start up time when you turn the camera on.<br /><br />There are a few things I wish the D70 had.  First, I wish it had a bigger viewfinder (like the one in the N80).  Second, I wish it had \"live view\" on the LCD monitor like point and shoot cameras.  As far as I know no D-SLRs have \"live view.\"  Since SLRs have a through the lens viewfinder the camera's mirror (which flips up when the picture is taken) blocks the digital sensor. Third, I wish it had a sensitivity speed of ISO 100.  And fourth, I wish it had a mirror lockup mode for taking slower shutter speed pictures (The mirror can be locked up for cleaning, why not for picture taking!).<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a great camera and you will not be disappointed.  I think it is a steal for $1,000 since it has many professional D-SLR features.  I would definitely buy it again and I very highly recommend it.  Best of luck in your digital photography endeavor!","Love the camera.  Perfect for move from film slr to digital slr.  I love this camera.  Will keep it for life.","I really like this camera. The best thing about it is the speed, which operates as fast as you can press buttons. The picture quality is wonderful and the size and handling are exemplary. The only negative I could say is that it is Nikon's least expensive DSLR and feels that way. Not exactly \"cheap\" feeling, but more like \"well made in Thailand\" rather than \"well made in Japan\".  The best way to sum up this camera is that if offers all the speed, flexibility, customization, and picture quality of cameras costing 2 or 3 times more, but wraps it in a package that feels like a budget camera. The plus side of this though is that you don't feel so bad traveling around with it, being paranoid about it getting stolen, damaged, etc. - it's not a huge cost to replace it compared to more expensive cameras that offer the same performance and picture quality. I used the money I saved on the body to buy quality Nikon lenses and am exrtemely pleased with the quality of pictures I'm getting. I would buy it again in a second.<br /><br />(...)","What is up Nikon?  How do I know what mode I am in when it is dark?  Sure there is a backlite LCD panel but it doesn't tell you what mode you are in.  And since the program dial just spins around you can't count back what mode you are in either.  I guess I will have to carry around a pocket light.  Why did Nikon take away such a basic feature.  Also the AF illumin. light doesn't stay on long enough and takes too long for it to light up again.  Oh and fix the dust on the CCD issue.  Come on camera guys we are forking over thousands of dollars for this stuff and still dealing with dust?  Even the cheaper digitals have solved the problem.  Overall not a bad camera.  WB is too warm on A with flash.  Nikon still has some homework to finish.","I've had this camera for three months and have shot several thousand pictures. I tried the Olympus 8MP 8080 but it was noisy except for ISO 50 like all prosumer ZSLR's. I exchanged it this beauty and after the first day never looked back.<br /><br />Everything you've read is true, GREAT pictures, NO more shutter lag, battery lasts about 4x longer than compact cameras since you set up the shot from the viewfinder not the LCD which uses power. Plus the battery is powerful, 1400mAh. I now rarely use Photoshop. It's easy to use and has many, many functions including the ability to fine tune the white balance--very useful and many development options.<br /><br />The lens is top notch, not like the kit lens with the Canon Rebel. To compliment this lens I picked up a Nikon 28-200. Great lens for about $300.00 that also works very well for macro shooting since it focuses up to about 15 inches. Add an extension tube and you can photograph the pollen in a flower with razor sharp results. No need to pick up a macro lens this one does it all plus it's a great lens for walking around. Don't get the Tamron 28-300 since images are soft between 200-300mm and it will depreciate faster than any Nikon lens because of the name. I also picked up a used razor sharp 70-210 f4.0-5.6 lens for only $150.00 which is much, much better than the new 80-200 or 80-300 more expensive Nikon lenses.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Simply great shots<br />Ease of Use<br />Instant On<br />Super Fast<br />Lots of Features<br />Software: Nikon View browser is very good--included<br />Software: Nikon Capture 4--great but only a 30 day trial verison supplied<br /><br />Cons:<br />Software: Nikon Capture-to open NEF files is $99.00, should be free<br />Wish the LCD was bigger but it is standard size<br />Light on top panel should be on-off instead of staying on for just 10 secs<br />Light on top could be brighter or indigo blue for easier read<br />Auto White balance runs a little cool/blue<br /><br />White Balance Tips:<br />For most shots simply set the Auto White Balance at -2 or -3 setting and leave it there. This will warm the shots very nicely.<br />For outdoor shots on nice days use the Cloudy or Shade setting. The Daylight/Sunny setting is little cool-blue. With Cloudy the added warmth or red looks great. But you won't go wrong with Auto -3 outdoors.<br />Use Shade setting with a -2 or -3 setting for spectacular red sunsets.<br />Flash portraits use Flash setting with a -1 or -2 for warmer skin tones<br />If you use a warming or colored filters be careful since Auto White balance will compensate for the effect.<br />Shades of red get stronger by using the settings in the following order-Sunlight--Flash--Cloudy--Shade. Negative numbers in the fine adjustments add red, positive numbers add blue. So Incandescented adds blue/cool and +3 adjustment adds more blue. at the other end of the blue-red spectrum, Shade with -3 is the reddest/warmest. This is great for special effects--Incandescent on a cool snowy day adds blue and makes your shots look cold.<br /><br />Software Tips for RAW/NEF files:<br />If you want to shoot the best quality and have the greatest freedom editing you can shoot in Nikons RAW format called NEF (Nikon Electronic Format) but you will need a RAW converter.<br />Nikon Capure software, 30 day trial included with camera, has the best converter and is a great editing program but limited--no layers or selection tools.<br />Photoshop CS and Photoshop Elements 3.0 has a RAW converter so you don't need to buy Nikon Capture but it does do a better job,particularly with White Balance.<br />Photoshop Elements 2.0 can be used for NEF if you load Nikon View (included) since it does include a light version of Nikon's NEF converter--crude White Balance and Exposure only.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this great camera.","Lets get to the main point of buying a DSLR - I wanted fast & sharp results with versatility included. This is what I wanted and this is what I got! The price couldn't get much cheaper or it'd be an absolute steal (not that it already isn't). I feel like a real professional just HOLDING the D70. Truth is, I wouldn't give up this baby for the world. Digital SLR's are so much better than some cheap point and shoot restraintive camera. Break free and buy a D70! Look at the flawless reviews, try it out, and see for yourself. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!","Pros: All the advantages of a D-SLR (fast ISO speed, super-low noise, wide range of aperture and shutter speeds, versatility, huge buffer, compatibility with high-speed cards, etc.); unmatchable color accuracy and brilliance; beautiful style, battery life (After I took 500 regular photos and 20 flash photos, the battery still showed full.  Nikon¡¦s claim that the battery can last 2,000 photos may not be too far from truth); reasonable price.<br />Cons:  The camera has a few minor annoyances, but the most horrible thing about this camera which may apply to all other D-SLRs is the dust problem.  Knowing that D-SLR is very vulnerable to dust, I never took off the lens (included in the kit) after I first mounted it on the camera.  Yet, the dust still somehow managed to get into the low-pass of the CCD anyway, though I have strictly followed the professional standards in avoiding dust from getting into the camera.  After less than two months of use, I found a few consistent light dots on bright areas of the photos such as the blue sky.  However, I was delighted to find cleaning the CCD is not as difficult as I first thought.  Just strictly follow what the manual says and it took me less than 2 minutes to get the dust off the CCD, though I couldn¡¦t see with my eye any dust on the CCD itself.  I hope Nikon can make better seals around the lens¡¦ mount in its next version of affordable D-SLR or enable the camera to clean its CCD like Canon 10D or Olympus E-1.","I got frustrated taking pictures and not being able see what I was getting in the viewfinder.  And I was even more frustrated with the shutter lag.  There was no choice.  I had to move up to an SLR.  I read everything, and spoke to top commercial and news photographers about what to get.  They naturally, chose top of the line Canons and Nikons.  When the D70 came out, I tried it and fell in love with it.  You flick a switch and it's on.  Hit the shutter and you have an instant picture.  Of course the quality is supurb, but what makes it a joy is that it's easier to use than a prosumer digital camera.  I started off with the kit lens and within two weeks moved up to the Vibration-Reduction 24-120 lens.  It's slower than the kit lens, but the vibration reduction compensates for it.  News photographers have told me that the D-70 works as well as their top of the line Nikons, but they wouldn't use one because it isn't built to take the beating they give their cameras.  Once you get the camera, you won't be able to put it down.  It makes me wonder what Nikon will come out with next.","I have been a Nikon user for over 20 years, and owned at least six different bodies and lots of lenses. My all time favorite is the FM2N. Why Nikon? It's the lenses! Nikon seems to understand this is the main selling point of their system. SO they have never changed the F lens mount. You can use older manual focus AI and AIS lenses on the D70. The bad news: The meter won't work. However on a digital SLR, the LCD confirmation mitigates this since you can check your exposures. You could also use a handheld light light meter. More good news: depth of field preview works with AI and AIS lenses! So I've been having a great time using my manual lenses on the D70. This camera is really a winner and costs no more than some of the ridiculous \"prosumer\" digicams out there. It's far more versatile.<br />It's easy to use-if you've used another digicam or even a recent Nikon 35mm SLR. The fact that I've been able to figure out most settings necessary without even cracking the manual is impressive.<br />The flash syncs at 1/500! This makes for some really creative fill flash outdoors or in the studio. All necessary settings are within easy reach, and no stupid five click deep menus for stuff like ISO. All the important stuff like ISO, Metering pattern, Exposure modes, White Balance, etc. have a dedicated button right on the body. No fumbling to change stuff while shooting.<br />Shutterlag is virtually non-existent. It's almost as good as my FM2N. But face it, if you want zero shutter lag then get a manual 35mm camera! However with the D70, you will not notice it.<br />The Lens-the kit lens is a 18-70mm (27 to 105mm). It's pretty good, and the color has that gorgeous Nikon hue. It's bright for a zoom. A lot of people are criticizing this lens unjustly. It does have a lot of barrel distortion on the wide end, but for landscapes you'd never know. It's got a very good wide angle range for a digital lens. It's a great value, and way better than any junk Sigma puts out.<br />ViewFinder-Some have slammed the viewfinder. It does take a little getting used to, like looking down a long dark corridor at first. But it's just as bright as any AF SLR once you get used to it. I think Nikon designed it this way to get people used to the CCD aspect ratio. It's kind of like watching a DVD in letterbox format. Good news: the viewfinder has a diopter for eyeglass wearers.<br />Picture Quality-This is where the rubber meets the road. At all ISO settings, the images are superb. Colors are saturated and lifelike, with the \"Nikon Pop\". They remind me of a good ISO 100 slide film like Kodak E100G, or Fujichrome Velvia 100. Best of all, the grain is very low, even ISO 1600 is not bad when printed to 8 x10. This is a huge advance over my older Canon G2 digital. Like I said, think ISO 100 slide film.<br />This is destined to be one of Nikon's legends, like the N8008, N90, FM2N, etc. You get a lot of value for your money, much more than the Canon Digital Rebel. A lot of pros are buying D70s for backup, and the Press Photographers Association of Japan just picked the D70 as new camera of the year! What else could you ask for? This is a top drawer camera with a great lens.","Like Ken Rockwell said, this is the finest digital camera under $3000. I am an advanced user and have used this wonder toy to do all kinds of photography..action - using telephoto lenses, portraiture - in my makeshift studio using studio strobes, microphotography (not just macro) at 9X magnification by mounting on an old Olympus bellows and using Olympus macro lenses(dont ask me how), and even  everyday street shooting with a zoom lens. This camera excels in everything it does. Image quality when shooting RAW at ISO 200 and subject properly illuminated by multuple strobes, is simply unmatched.<br /><br />However nothing is perfect, and I am less than happy with the white balance. When WB is set on 'strobe', flash exposures come out warm. Thats not a problem at all as it can be corrected in a flash(pardon the pun) in photoshop. Better still is to set a custom WB by shooting a gray/white card in the same ambient light as that illuminating the subject.","No kidding, I'm almost a raw amateur.  I put down photography 20 years ago and finally decided to buy another camera - I knew it'd be digital, hardly anyone talks about film these days - so I started looking around the very day the D70 came out.  Knew nothing about it, only that I couldn't find one at five different stores I stopped at in the Boston area.  One look at the specs and the price, though, and I knew a fixed lense digicam was a serious waste of money for a compromise.<br />Bought the camera with the 18-70mm lense as well as a 70-300mm zoom I needed for flexibility.  Looked at the manual.  White balance?  What's that?<br />Took the camera out to a nearby lake.  What pictures!  Razor sharp.  First vari-setting I tried I could see the needles in the tops of evergreens fifty feet away on the LCD screen.  Bright display, fast starting, good viewfinder.  Been learning its foibles ever since.<br />Comments:  In bright sunlight there's a necessity to back off the ISO, white balance or exposure; but on the other end of the scale, I've taken images at 8:30 p.m., no flash, and liked the mood the camera captured.<br />Yes, incredibly flexible.  I like to shoot close-ups of swamp plants 20 feet away.  The 18-70mm seems to shoot a sharper picture, and the zoom leaves blur around the edges when I push its limits, but I'm really pleased with how handy this camera is, quick, adaptable, easy to use, high visibility.<br />Problems:  No handgrip available, I have to make one.  Also (maybe it's my big hands) the on-camera adjustment for shutter and aperture, done while focusing through the lense, seem a little difficult to adjust to.  No biggies, considering everything else.<br />Seriously, I'm still marveling at my good luck!  What a piece of technology!","I've been using a Nikon F4 for over 12 years and had no intention of going digital until a friend loaned me his Canon 10D- what a great camera.  Shortly thereafter Nikon released the D70 enabling me to acquire a reasonably affordable digital body and to keep using all my great Nikkor glass.  Although the D70 feels like a toy compared to the F4 it takes fantastic pictures - as good or better than my best taken with Velvia at least up to 8x10 (printed using an Epson SP2200/Epson Premium Luster Paper).  The D70's easy to use and has all the feature's you'd want. I usually shoot on manual, but the D70's \"autopilot\" programs are great & shooting at ISO 1600 gives nice results.  \"Optimizing\" with PhotoShop has been infrequent.  The only problem I've encountered so far is that the CR2's (not cheap) go very quickly - but the rechargeable batteries last \"forever\".  The D70's a no-brainer.<br />***********<br />Almost one year & about 15,000 shots later the only thing I miss about my F4 is not being able to shoot quickly, not being able to take full advantage of my 17-35 mm zoom and not getting enough arm exercise (so I still use the F4 for these purposes).  The D70's fantastic!!","First, I'm at the bottom of the barrel among my \"expertise\" when it comes to REAL cameras. Almost all of my total experience is with cheaper digital cameras (well, I owned a Kodak 110, once) ranging from the Casio DC10 to a Fujifilm S602Zoom (which has all but been abandoned by Fuijfilm!!!).<br />So, with that thought in mind: WHAT A CAMERA! Details galore. Color that's amazing. Point-and-shoot never looked so great! And that's with just two days of \"outta the box\" settings.<br />For those of us who don't know the difference between an SLR and a Space Shuttle, this camera is both a savior and a potential demon. It's taken me three hours of flippin' through the manuals for both the camera and the SB800 flash I bought, just to figure-out how to make the flash a remote slave. One (experienced?) reviewer says \"it'll take you fifteen minutes to figure-out the settings.\" Well, yeah... if you're experienced. For me, it's taken three days just to feel comfortable enough to test a few of the billions of possible settings.<br />This ain't no slam; just be warned that you've got four years of college ahead of you if you want to approach the full capabilities of this camera. The nice thing is, your pictures will look GREAT, Fabulous, Astounding and Sensational without knowing a lot, and you'll have an enormous amount of future improvements as you master more of the features and art!<br />One serious warning: the dude at the camera store (yes, I pay more, but they're the professionals who are there when you have questions, and SOMEONE has to support them!) informed me that Nikon has decided that their newer cameras will NOT work with other brands of flashes, and even with Nikon's OLDER flashes! Like some cell phones that fry a third-party batteries, Nikon has decided they've had enough of \"the competition\" being attached to their cameras. He says he's considering buying a D70, but the fact that many of his non-CPU-driven lenses will either not work at all, or reduce the built-in functionallity found in the camera. Check it out before you buy, if you have lenses and flashes laying around you'd like to use!<br />Best money on a camera I've ever spent. And in all likelyhood, the LAST camera I ever buy!<br />Thank, you Nikon!!!","Simply put, the Nikon D70 is the finest camera I have ever used.  As an amateur photographer I have owned a variety of Nikon SLRs during the age of film photography.  That is until the digital bug hit me with the introduction of the Olympus C2020 (a superb camera in its own right).  I have anxiously awaited the day when I could return to the SLR and do it digitally.  The D70 has made my day!  This camera is incredibly easy to use and intuitive right out of the box.  You can easily operate exposure controls, flash, and etc. without going through menus.  All the settings can be seen in the viewfinder and the control dials are in the right places so you don't have to take your eye off the subject.  It felt like coming home again to use an SLR, shoot through a viewfinder, and quickly and easily adjust exposures.  Since there is no shutter-lag with this camera, and image writing to the card is fast, you don't have to anticipate your shots.  Image quality is phenomenal and the 6 megapixel count assures you of excellent \"darkroom\" control.  There are so many image capture options available in its menu that it pays to test the camera for settings that satisfy your needs (e.g. regulating sharpness, contrast, and tonal distributions).  But even the default automatic settings provide photographs that can be beautifully printed right out-of-the-box.  The 18-70mm DX lense that comes with the kit (equivalent to 27-105mm for 35mm film) is a great buy and delivers excellent image quality.  I only wish its filter size (67mm) matched any of the filters that I had acquired for my old lenses.  For the serious amateur who wants the level of control and image quality that only an SLR can provide, the Nikon D70 is definitely it.  The affordable digital SLR has arrived!  Sorry, Kodak, the era of film photography has truly come to an end.","I have been holding out for a few years now to get a digital SLR because what I saw before this was simply not worth my money. I have to say I am glad I waited. Hats off to all those who were involved in designing and making of this camera. (Whoever they are would have gotten a big bonus if I were the boss ;-)<br />I got this camera for a trip coming up. I wasn't sure if it would be worthwhile to sink the money into a camera before a major trip. I was also concerned about whether or not I’d have enough time to learn to use the camera. So I got it just to see and I have been in love with it ever since. I now have had the camera for 3 days now and it is definitely not going back! There are so many great things about this camera but here is some of what excites me:<br />1) Picture quality - I have taken test shots under different lighting conditions and most of them came out great without any special setting outside of the usual aperture and shutter changes. This camera makes me look good.<br />2) The lens - It is sharp and it has a zoom range that is useful for most daily shootings.<br />3) The button layouts and menus are intuitive.<br />4) Love the instant gratification and the fact that I can see the mistakes I made so that I can make instance correction by taking another shot......great for learning<br />5) The camera is smaller and lighter than my regular SLR and has an on camera flash. All of these features are all very convenient for traveling.<br />6) I can charge the battery independent from the camera so that I don't need to worry about losing the camera in a hostel somewhere ;-)<br />7) I can get good pictures in low light conditions that I couldn’t get decent shots for using my regular SLR even with 800 ISO film.<br />8) Last but not least.....the camera feels solid and feels like a regular SLR<br />I am confident that I will get better pictures on this trip particularly because of #4.....no one will even have a chance to see those bad shots, ha.","I am not a professional photographer, but I learned to shoot with a 35mm Nikon n70.  I made the transition to digital with an S1, and recently purchased a D70 kit (including the new AF lens).  It is tremendous.  The auto mode produces nice picturesif you want point and shoot functionality, and for long time Nikon SLR users, you will take 15 mintues to figure out where everything is, because it's all where you'd expect Nikon to put it.  Highly recomeded!","Sorry to inform all of the final death of film photograhy.  Finally, a full featured digital SLR that makes no compromises is available for the consumer market. The camera is amazingly fast, works in the dark, has a great integrated flash, is easy to use, has a battery that lasts for days, and is fully compatible with all nikon AF lenses. Not only that, it takes pictures that will shame the 150 year old chemical film process into oblivion. I own a nikon 5700 and I am happy to report that this camera simply blows it, or anything else in the market at any price, away. Thank you Nikon, this is the digital camera all photo buffs have been waiting for!","I have a Nikon D100 and love it.  But if I were in the market today, the D70 would be the one I selected.  At $999 (body only) this is absolutely an outrageous bargain, and Nikon has plainly positioned this camera price/feature-wise to dominate the market.<br />This camera and others like it herald the death of film.  This camera will produce breathtakingly good images and you don't have to pay to develop them before you view them.  Just take your CF card and attach it to a reader and you can review the pictures on your personal computer.  Then select the ones you want and print them yourself (good printers are pretty cheap these days) or submit them on-line to any number of professional printing houses who will mail you wonderful prints in a day or two.  And you can process the images with any of several superb (and inexpensive) programs giving you a \"digital darkroom\" capability that far exceeds what an expensive and messy film darkroom could achieve with film.  The digital darkroom is a reality!<br />The D70 has all of the features that a serious amateur (and even a pro, IMHO) will want.  First the basics: this camera will use all of the Nikon D and G autofocus lenses.  Put in a 512MB CF card and it will take 51 RAW pix or several hundred JPEG pix, depending on your setting.  These 6 Megapixel pictures are indistinguishable from film for essentially all purposes.  What's not to like?<br />The D70 has improved Through-The-Lens metering, and improved buffering.  This means that your images will likely be perfectly exposed each time.  It also means that you can take many pictures in rapid sequence, and the camera will be able to keep up with you.  Although the D70 is positioned slightly below the D100, in reality Nikon chose to improve these features somewhat over the D100!  The D70 is not a \"crippled\" D100 the way the Canon Digital Rebel is a crippled Canon 10D (Canon's fine competing product to the D100).  Although the D100 has some features that the D70 lacks, the D70 shows that Nikon has learned from the comments and requests of D100 owners by providing a bigger and faster buffer allowing users to take pictures in rapid-fire sequence.<br />Although the D70 is somewhat lighter than the D100, it is solidly built, and I like the heft and feel of the camera--it does not feel flimsy.  It is light but solid.  The menus are intelligently set out, and after an hour or so, most users will no longer need the manual.<br />The D70 is a winner, and the only problem that prospective buyers will have with it is finding one."]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DMC-LC70","amazon_reviews":["This has been a good travel/weekend camera.

I am writing this review almost 2 years after purchasing this product. Since I have bought this product, I know that digital cameras have changed and improved dramatically. Even with that understanding, I LOVE this camera. I originally bought a sony cybershot and spent $200 more than this Kodak camera. After trying to figure out how to take good pictures with the expensive cybershot, I returned the sony and bought the kodak instead.<br /><br />I am pleased with this camera because it is EASY to use. My wife hates electronics and can still take remarkable pictures with the easy share. After 2 years, I have not even looked at the manual or used the kodak software--that's how easy it is. I use the automatic setting and the camera takes wonderful, colorful, bright and crisp pictures. The video recording aspect is good, but who would buy a digital camera to take videos anyway? It is small enough to fit in your pants pocket, but there are smaller cameras out there. The optical zoom could be a bit better and it takes several seconds to take a repeat picture because the lcd screen is a bit slow to refresh. Even with that said, I probably won't buy another digital camera for another year. When I do, it will be the newest kodak easyshare.","This is a good camera. I like it because it has a metal case versus the plastic ones of most. It takes good pictures from about 7-20 ft if the flash is on. The flash doesn't go that far. Also it takes good close ups if the flash is off. Sometimes it is to dark to not use the flash, but the flash makes everything overexposed at close range. Everything else is fine. The pictures are very good quality and there are tons of features. The videos are large, and they are pretty good quality too. Overall, it's a very good product.","...and I really mean it!!<br />My brother gave me this camera as a belated Christmas gift last year and I love him for it.  He searched high and low for this particular camera and after going to 8 different stores, he ended up ordering it from Amazon.  I have gotten so many compliments on my pictures.  The clarity is just over the top!!  Some pictures (the Magic Kindom castle, the cruise ship and the Washington Monument) look like postcards; they're so crystal clear.  I love taking pictures and being able to go home and print as many copies as I want the same day.  And I love making little videos and slide presentations to view on my widescreen tv.<br />I've directed atleast 4 other people to Amazon to order this camera.  I can't say enough about it.<br />My recommendation, BUY IT, USE IT, ENJOY IT!!! And don't forget to get the printing dock too!!","I've owned this camera for a year now, and it is my first digital camera. I'm pleased with it. You can carry it anywhere and it's surprisingly good at wide-range photos of landscapes and buildings as well as group photos at parties and other gatherings.<br /><br />My only problem with it is the flash: it's not very good for inside scenes, unless you are very close to your subject. However, if the room is brightly lit, the photo should be OK. If there is dark furniture or walls, you'll get a black background.<br /><br />It's definitely not good for concerts or stage performances.<br /><br />There is also a half-second latency which could present problems when trying to photograph sports, races, etc.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I've had a lot of fun with this little box. It was especially good at the beach this summer, as well as on some recent road trips through autumn scenery.","I take multiple digital pictures for various purposes regarding the field of architecture and planning.  This camera is a great buy, and I am very happy with the quality of the pictures it produces.  With a true 4MP image, It produces large enough pictures for my presentations.<br /><br /> When I was searching I wanted a brand that I was familiar with, because I ran into some manufacturers claiming they were selling 5-12 MP cameras for dirt cheap.  However, most of these MP calculations were interpoliated, which actually ruins the picture.  I am very satisfied with this product!","I didn't want a fancy digital camera with a bunch of bells and whistles that would be utterly wasted on me and just mean more things to break.  But I was also kind of camera snob.  A Kodak digital camera?  I thought I wanted something with more snob appeal.  After reading everything I could and going to every store imaginable, I settled on this one.  I liked the size, the weight, and the battery situation. I travel overseas a lot and the charger is a lot more reasonable in size than the other cameras I looked at.  And it's a simple use camera which is exactly what I wanted. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. My pictures are great, the color and clarity outstanding. I liked it so much I bought my mother a different Kodak model with the \"grip\" shape and she won't put it down.  If you want an easy, uncomplicated digital camera without a lot of frou-frou, I recommend this one!!","This is my first digital camera. Although i am a beginner i wanted some manual features to play with so i could learn, this camera has alot of manual features for a entry level camera. If manual features just confuse you, it has lots of auto modes so you dont have to think about it. I snagged this thing at Fry's Electronics on sale for $99, yes you read that right. That sale has passed but it might come back again. Anyways the pictures are fantastic, i will post one on this page if you want to look, it will be a flower. The pictures are great, it has video with sound, i love it and recommend it to anyone, especially at my price.<br /><br />I also bought an extra battery for $20, and a 512mb SD card for $25. (if your not already in love with Fry's you should be).","I decided to purchase this camera for my daughter for Christmas.  I have been encouraging her to take pictures since she was five, and I was, frankly, tired of buying disposables.  Since she is 10, I felt she was old enough to appreciate a camera that she wouldn't abuse, yet would let her share her vision of her world with me.  At a little over $200, I wasn't worried if she dropped it in a pool or a toilet; I gave her the camera with the caveat: it's yours, treat it with care and make it last.<br />If you have children (8-15), you know that they are more technically competent than we were at their age; just as we were more technically competent than our parents during our formative years (think TRS-80, Commodore 64...).<br />My daughter opened the camera, charged the battery, and took digipics within the first 4 hours.  Combined with the printer dock, she was printing digipics of Cliff, our cat, Toby, our dog, and a great group digipic (using the timer function and tripod) with no help from me or the instruction manual.<br />Online services certainly offer more inexpensive per print costs, but how can you compare instant Kodak-quality prints with wait-a-week-save-fifty-cents for slumber parties and last minute science projects.<br />The LS743 certainly is not the most advanced camera in the world, which is why I rate it 4 stars.  However, Kodak has made a camera that is as simple to use as a disposable, and coupled with the printer dock, is a rock-solid introduction to digital photography for your 10 year old daughter or your 70 year old mother.","This is my first digital camera and I received it for Christmas.  For it being my first, I like it very much.  Haven't tried taking many shots outside of the house, but inside, it's pretty easy.<br /><br />I'm probably gong to have to buy a memory card, cause I was only able to get about 12 pictures with internal memory.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's great.","I don'tknow why people give 5 stars here..<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />Problems starts when I was at wedding party. Every one was takieng pictures but not me !<br /><br />The camera's focus mechanism simply does not work in low-light conditions.<br /><br />Poor focus mechanism. very dark pictures in low light conditions. too bright macro pictures..<br /><br />Of course you can always use night mode, but without tripod pictures will not satisfy you..","I bought this camera through Amazon and received it a day or two before my sister-in-law's wedding.  I charged the battery the preceding night, took a ton of wedding shots (in and outside) and many other shots throughout the next month.  After nearly 30 days, well over 100 shots, lots of downloading, a wedding and a visit to my daughter at college the battery finally went out.  Wow!<br />Detail?  I was in my kayak and had a dragonfly land on my lap.  I took the shot and the detail is so good you can see the individual threads in the rip-stop nylon pants I was wearing and the detail of the web in it's wings!<br />Indoors?  I took a shot of my daughter and 2 friends (nighttime, incandescent light) ... she liked the photo so much that we cropped out her friends and edited it and its the photo she's going to use for her senior picture in her yearbook!<br />Video?  My other daughter is in the UMass Marching Band ... so I took 12 short (5-12 sec) videos of the Band and Colorguard at the UMass/Richmond game and the sound, with headphones, is quite good (better than regular TV sound).  The video was best if I didn't pan with the camera. The end of that day is when the battery ran out (one month after a full wedding, all the inbetween photos and 12 marching band short videos!).<br />I did buy an SD card reader at Office Max (...) so now I don't run the battery to download pictures, erase my card, etc.<br />I like the other reviewer's comment that it's like being married to a handsome prince ... it really IS an attractive camera.  After using my daughters Casio Exilim (nearly credit card sized) I knew I wanted a small camera.  I'm a high school administrator and it's very convenient to slip it over my head with the neckstrap and wander around \"capturing the moment.\"<br />I did a lot of internet camera shopping over the summer, waited for just the features I wanted, this camera was released, and I'm very happy with it.<br />I do have an old, outstanding Canon AE-1Program with the huge telephoto lens, etc, so I did not buy this camera intending for it to do everything.  This is my general purpose, get some GREAT shots, have some versatility, digital.  Took my (just what I selected, multiples of some, wallets of another) for a little over $5.0little SD card to Wal-Mart today (I carry it and the reader in an old hardshell glasses case!), got 21 prints 0 ... no waste on bad shots and no going back for reprints after seeing how they came out!<br />I did buy a \"Digital Promaster\" camera case at my local camera shop and when I dropped the camera (in the case) onto pavement from the 10th or so level of the bleachers at a soccer game, the camera was fine!<br />As you can see, I'm a very busy person ... and this camera keeps up with me. Way fun!","Owning this camera is kinda like being married to a handsome prince who unfortunately has prostrate cancer. The camera is very beautiful, compact and stylist. On the web, it doesn't look too glamorous but when I saw it at the Bestbuy, I fell in love with it. This camera stands out among all the other cameras. It is even more beautiful than canon s410. The solid construction and ultra compact size allows this camera to be truly pocketable. The blue power button looks very cool and prevents accidental turn on which can damage the lens.<br /><br />The interface is also very user friendly. The zoom dial allows the user to quickly zoom in or out. When needed, you can turn off/on the LCD screen with just one button to save battery life. After you have taken the pictures, you can review and delete them easily without going through the menu. Battery life is excellent. I took more than 150 shots with LCD on one recharge.<br /><br />Performance is very good: Quick start up time (~4 sec) and average shutter lag (<1 sec). Picture processing time (\"shot to shot time\") is also good at only 5/6 sec. There is virtually no red eye. (Only 1 out of 300+ pictures had red eye.) I think it was possible because the camera's long body allowed Kodak to put some distance between the lens and the flash unit. If the indoor light is low, the camera fires two successive flashes - one to contract people's pupil and second one to light up the scene.<br /><br />There are some good extras such as the orientation sensor which automatically shows the pictures in upright position, multispot focus which allows automatic focus even if the subject is not at the center, a TV output which allows you to see pictures and videos on the TV and the video mode with no length restriction (but do NOT expect this camera or any digital camera to replace your miniDV camcorder).<br /><br />BUT Kodak ls743 faults at its main objective - taking good pictures. The jpeg compression is quite strong; it causes loss of details which is quite evident for complex objects such as trees and flower garden. In most cases, the picture doesn't quite look \"sharp.\" Other complaint is the slight tendency toward reddish hue which produces inaccurate flesh tone for moderately dark skin people (Mexicans, Indians, mixed ethnicities, etc.) But for Whites, Asians (Orientals), and African Americans, the pictures are okay.<br /><br />The main problem I have with this camera is dark indoor images... maybe something wrong with the light metering sensor... I tried changing the EV setting, bringing table lamp to add more light in the room and even holding the camera in different ways, but alas, nothing helped. Right now, I am using Paint Shop Pro's \"One Step Photo Fix\" to tweak the pictures into acceptable quality.<br /><br />After reading all the good reviews about this camera, I think I am poor person who had the luck of getting a defective camera. Or, maybe the people who wrote those reviews were simply too happy and excited about their new camera and overlooked its problems.","I recently purchased this Kodak LS743 camera after purchasing 2 other digital cameras and returning them. I started with the Nikon CoolPix 3100 which was a 3-megapixel for $179. I took it to the zoo and took some really good pictures, but wasn't entirely pleased with the zoom quality and it had a purplish tinge to the prints so I decided to try a higher megapixel camera. I found the Gateway D510 which was a 5-megapixel for only $199. I was excited to try it out. I was extremely disappointed. The print quality was worse than my old Olympus 2-megapixel and the camera got so hot in my hand while taking just a few pictures and even just reviewing the pix. I took it back the next day and had an extremely difficult time trying to find a good camera.<br /><br />I really wanted the digital camera to take action photos of my son and pets at home. Since I didn't want to make another mistake purchasing a bad camera and having to pay a 15% restocking fee, I took my time playing around with all the cameras at the store. I had the camera associate move around so I could practice taking shots using the sport/action mode. I tested a few Fujis and also a few Canons and they were blurry. I tested the Kodaks and they came out great! I didn't want to pay too much for the camera (I paid $299), but I didn't want to risk buying another cheap one, so I bought the LS743. Right out of the box, it was so easy to use! It did not come with a SecureDigital card, but lucklily I had bought one for the Gateway camera.<br /><br />I practiced taking action shots on the way home by pointing the camera out the window while I was driving and randomly taking pictures. I reveiwd them later and was amazed at the quality. Homes in the background were super crisp and the detail on the cars which were moving at over 30mph were as if they were not moving at all. I couldn't believe it! Little did I know that this camera also has video with audio capability with no time limit (only limited to your SD card memory). The quality of the video is as good as my digital camcorder if not better! I am so happy I went with Kodak.<br /><br />This camera is nicely sized and takes great pix! The ONLY flaw I have found so far is taking pictures in low light - the LCD display is very dark and I can't seem to adjust the brightness. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting an easy-to-use point-and-shoot digital camera with great picture quality. The camera also comes with Kodak software which lets you create digital photo albums and burn them to CDs as slide shows.","This is my first Digital Camera purchase - and BOY am I glad I got the Kodak LS743! I have a husband & 2 daughters and I take pictures all the time-My film developing bill was high! Now I can pick and choose the shots I want to print. I can also create family albums on the computer - to eventually be put onto CD's & set to music!<br />They have the 5 megapixel camera's out, but I really don't think that I see that much of a difference with this 4 megapixel. I get Great photos-sharp & clear. And the zoom lets me be flexible with my shots. The color is awesome!-These pictures turn out beautiful!!<br />This is a smaller camera than any I saw. I like the sleek design.<br />You can also shoot 2 minutes of QVGA video. I haven't done enuf with this feature yet, but I know it's longer than some camera's on the market allow for video time.<br />I have used the Auto mode quite a bit while getting used to the camera, but it also has portait, close-up, night, sport, snow, & many other modes! It has flash, & red-eye reduction.  You can even store email addresses in the camera & hit the \"share\" button to share special photos with your contacts. It comes with a rechargable lithium-ion battery and a sleek charger that you can plug into an outlet.<br />This camera is simple to learn & the pictures are amazing! I highly recommend this camera!<br /><br />1smileycat :-)","I've been considering a digital camera for almost a year, and my in-laws have a Kodak 6330 that they like a lot.  Kodak's general ease-of-use was a definite draw to me.<br />I bought the LS743 yesterday, and it was very easy to set up and begin using.  Battery life is excellent, and the battery is rechargeable (I bought a 2nd battery for only $20 to have a spare, too).  The camera is compact but seems very well-put-together.  My in-laws have a 6000 dock, and this camera will work on it, too.<br />The lens is an upscale lens that is supposed to be a bit better than Kodak's lower-end models - I haven't taken enough pictures yet to notice the difference.<br />I'd say the camera is excellent for beginners, but also there are plenty of features in the system for someone who wants to be able to adjust the shots on their own for a more-customized photo.  (At least it seems that way from reading the user guide.)  :-)<br />All in all, great little camera!","If you are a DP Pro, then please dont read this review. But, if you are like the majority who wants an easy, reliable Digital camera and 'MOST OF THE TIME USE BASIC FEATURES ONLY' person you must read on.<br />I bought this camera after doing lot of research in the net and feedback from my peers. When I got this, I was amazed to see the picture quality and easiness in using it. I was shooting with in 3 hrs after the Fedex guy left. (You've to charge the battery for ~3 hours before first use). I still have to invent all the advanced features and modes of the camera. But, if all DEFAULT and AUTO modes are this good, then I am sure it will be BETTER with advanced features. The battery life time is pretty good too.<br />Only concern is, the door for the output terminals (USB/Adapter),that looks bit shaky!<br />After my initial research, things got filterd in to just three items: One Sony model and two Kodak model, CX7430 and LS743. Sony may be great but it was not good for me because<br />1)Seen pathetic remarks about their customer service<br />2)It has only 90 days warranty.<br />If you combine both(1) and (2) above, its risky to buy their product. I dont beleive in buying extended waranty for electronic stuff because the technology changes rapidly and, in another 2 years, you'll find yourself in a situation to buy a new camera than paying for Extended warranty. Since Kodak has one year warranty and my 'platinum' credit card has another one year free extended warranty, I had to decide between CX7430 and LS743. It was a tough decison, because both cameras are good. But the LS743 is the one that got PCMAG's Editors choice award (...) Looks like, it was a perfect decision.","I was trying to buy a good 4MP camera and was comparing between the LS743 and Nikon 4300<br />Since i had a KODAK 2MP camera and results were preety good, so i decided to go ahead with the latest LS743 and am happy to take that decision.<br />The camera is supercool in looks and takes superb pictures both in light and dark.<br />I think it is a very good camera in the 4MP range.","4MP Kodak LS743camera.....EXCELLENT for beginners<br />I LIKE TO SAY,<br /> I CHOSE THE KODAK LS743 CAMERA BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW CAMERA.

I love it's compact size that can fit in any pocket or tiny purse and it takes great photos. It's really easy to use, just this weekend I let my 4 year old cousin try it and even he could take great pictures.  The only problem I see is that close-up pictures of people tend to sometimes get overexposed by the flash but other than that it's great!","I've used the LS753 for about two years, and have been very happy with its performance.  The absolute best aspect of the camera is its size: it fits very well into a pocket, meaning you can have it immediately on hand whenever the situation is right for taking a photo.  It also fits well into the hand.  While there are a number of adjustments and mode settings, the average user will quickly realize that the default settings are best for the majority of your photos.<br /><br />The camera has enough resolution that you can easily pull closeups out of your original photo, using PhotoShop or any of the photo editing packages.  I tend to take a somewhat oversized image with the camera, and then use PhotoShop to edit out the extra material.  The resulting image virtually always has enough resolution left to create a sharp print, even if I blow it up to 5x7.  Without cropping, or with only minor cropping, the camera's image creates a pleasing 8x10 print, excellent for giving as a present.<br /><br />The camera's base unit is another example of great product engineering.  I have the standard base, without the printer (instead using an external Canon printer).  The camera sits firmly on the base, on top of my computer table.  The base is more or less permanently connected to my PC using a USB cable.  Whenever I want to move photos from the camera to my PC, I just push a button on the base, and the images are quickly moved to my PC.  I never lose track of where my camera is-when not in my pocket, it sits neat and ready (and automatically recharging its battery) on top of the base unit, next to my PC.  I've never had the camera run out of power, by the way, even when on vacation for more than a week.  No need to change batteries and such.<br /><br />About the only weakness I've noticed is that the flash isn't powerful enough to create a good photo when you're more than a few yards away from the subject.  For those photos, I tell the camera to shut off the flash, and holding the camera as steady as I can, take a flashless photo.  Usually works out to be an acceptable image.<br /><br />The camera has also survived without damage any number of falls, and uses in light rain conditions.  In short, it's quite sturdy.<br /><br />Perhaps someday I'll replace the camera as the technology continues to evolve, but that day isn't anywhere in the near future.  It does what I want, and does it well.","Very positive purchasing experience. Efficeint processing, superb delivery and communication between seller and buyer. Easy insallation with provided Easy Share disk and booklet. Excellent camera functions with / without computer. Would certainly purchase from seller again.","I previously emjoyed the 743 before i dropped that into a sedona arizona river. I then had no money and had to move on with an HP which i ended up hating after my 743. Once i got a little bit of cash i decided to take the risk and upgrade to the 753 even though it was a refurbished one off of ebay but have never regreted it since. It takes great videos with audio playback (unlike hp) and takes amazing pictures along with being incredibly easy to work (which i need). Overall, i will not be able to move onto a different camera until either another accident or a better version of the kodak easyshare worth buying comes out.<br /><br />And with regards to the guy below, he said he had to send in his when it needed to be fixed...i got the original kodak i had worked on(the 743 i dropped) at a circuit city by my house it was just to far beyond repair.","This is my fifth digital camera and assuming it does not break, I will have this one for a long time.  It is by far the best of any that I have had in the past.<br /><br />The pictures are great.  I do not know why one of the reviews was not pleased with the picture quality.  Maybe they did not focus it first (by pressing the button half way down)?<br /><br />The quality of the movie mode was also better than any of the others that I had before.  It's not exactly as clear as you would get with a camcorder, but it is much less choppy than others that I have seen.  The audio is also clear.<br /><br />The best feature for me was the ability to control the flash and mode without scrolling through five menus.  There is one button for flash mode, one for picture mode (portrait, close up, moving, auto, etc.) and there is a menu to change other settings that would not be changed as often.<br /><br />Another important feature was the price.  Mine was refurbished and was only $169.  I don't think that there is a better camera out there in this price range.","Bought this camera today and am really pleased with it so far.  The pictures are great.  If you're looking for perfect video, though, you should probably look somewhere else.  The videos are good, but not fabulous.  The software that comes with this camera is so easy and helpful.  It really makes emailing the pictures and movies so simple.  I don't usually make comments on products, but I wanted to give everyone considering buying this one a heads up that you can find this same camera for $199 at Circuit City (and around $250 with the docking unit at Sam's).  Good luck finding the camera that's right for you!","This is my sixth digital camera in as many years.<br /><br />I've been playing with this camera for several days now and I'm must amazed at the quality of the photos. Color is dead on. Seems to take great pictures both indoors and out.<br /><br />Some of the other reviews complain about burry pictures and dark pics indoors. Not seeing any of that with my photos. Then again I've been choosing the appropriate modes when takingn pictures. Love the rotary dial.<br /><br />As for the camera forgetting it's settings when you turn it off, I actually prefer it. It forces you to set the camera to the proper mode when you pull it out. Which you can do very quickly once you've learned the various icons/modes and how to use the rotary dial.<br /><br />I've always been an Olympus camera fan up until now. Kodak blows away my Camadiea D-510.<br /><br />I can't wait to go on a trip this spring and take more photos.","When I first saw this camera, I thought to myself, \"Kodak has finally gotten it right.\" Ever since they started making digital cameras, Kodak has had, in my opinon, some of the best picture quality available. The metering has always been dead-on and the pictures, although somewhat over-saturated, have always featured deep, sharp colors and extraordinary clarity. The only thing that prevented me from buying a Kodak digital camera was the fact that their bodies were cheaply made out of lightweight plastic. Then they moved into the Easy Share line of cameras geared to the entry-level market and things went from bad to worse with the camera styles getting progressively larger and the bodies getting progressively cheaper.<br /><br />But with the release of the LS753 (and its 4 MP younger brother the LS743), Kodak finally smartened up and made an ultra-compact, sleek, attractive, sturdy camera geared to the mid-level user. And the camera is every bit as nice as it looks on the internet. The LS753 is a slick little device. Weighing in at just under 6 oz. (without battery) and measuring just larger than a deck of cards, this camera is small enough and light enough to easily fit in your pocket or comfortably fit on your belt. The body is made of high impact plastic and features a metallic front that gives the camera a sturdy feel without making it too heavy or bulky. It's finished in a metallic silver with just a hint of blue tones which, in my opinion, makes for a very attractive color. Ergonomically, everything is exactly where it should be and the camera feels very comfortable in your hand. One of the nicest features is the inclusion of a button on top of the camera to quickly change flash settings. Also, the camera features a small dial on top, right in front of the shutter button, which allows you to change camera modes. The default setting is always automatic so you never have to worry about accidently setting the dial somewhere you don't want it and then having it in the wrong position when the camera starts up. All in all, this is a perfect design. But, unfortunately, the positive features end there.<br /><br />As I said, I was fully expecting that this camera would have taken beautiful pictures, based on my past experience with Kodak. I mean, with today's technology, picture quality should only be getting better, right? Wrong. Here's why:<br /><br />1. The pictures, although clear and crisp in bright light, are far too dark when taken with the flash. But the problem is not consistent and it has everything to do with the automatic ISO and speed settings that the camera uses.  At equal distances, some of the flash pictures will be far too dark and some will be acceptable. It seems that the shutter is very fast, but maybe too fast for the size of the lens and the power of the flash. It seems to me, for the majority of the automatic flash pictures, that the camera is not letting enough light in. In fairness, you do have manual control over some of these settings (exposure and ISO) and I'm sure, with some tweaking, you can get closer to the right mix. But, for this size camera, why should we be concerned with such things? This is a point-and-shoot, and you expect to be able to do just that.<br /><br />2. The flash is far too small for the camera and, more often than not, you will find that it will light up only the very closest objects. This gives the unpleasant effect of having only half of your pictures illuminated. Coupled with the problem above, the bottom line is that flash pictures are not at all acceptable for this price camera. When compared to my Canon S40, which is a similar compact camera, there just is no comparison. The Kodak is just not acceptable for indoor use.<br /><br />3. The camera features a 1.8\" LCD display which is crisp, sharp, and easy to see even in bright places. However, it has one major flaw which is that the pictures appear much more dull and dark on the LCD screen then they do when viewed on a computer. (Even the ones that actually are dull and dark as described above are FAR worse when viewed on the LCD screen). This can actually be a difficult adjustment in the beginning because, when previewing pictures on the screen, you may be inclined to discard pictures that you think are too dark, only to find out that they would have been acceptable (or close to it) when viewed on a computer.<br /><br />4. The low battery indicator is not at all obvious, with just a very small flashing white icon in the far bottom corner of the LCD screen. Maybe I'm not paying enough attention, but I almost never see it. And it seems to comes on just before the battery actually dies. The end result is that the battery dies and the camera shuts down as a surprise. And not a pleasant one.<br /><br />5. The autofocus is terrible, particularly in lower light conditions. You will find that you have to discard about 10% of your pictures because of blur, even with the most steady of hands. This is beacuse the camera was made to point and shoot very quickly without having to wait for the camera to autofocus. And, 90% of the time, it does fine. But for the other 10%, it is very frustrating. I would rather have the camera autofocus for a second or two and beep when it is in focus so that I know the picture is ready to be taken. Not having to wait is a nice feature, but you have no idea what the end result will be. I have also had problems with the camera focusing on the wrong subject. For example, just today I took a family portrait using the auto-timer and the picture was blurry. Obviously it had nothing to do with movement because neither us, nor the camera were in motion. It just has to do with, again, bad internal automatic settings.<br /><br />Is it all bad? Well, not really. As I said, the design is great. And if it had better guts, the camera would be perfect. One thing I love is the comapct battery charger that plugs right into the wall. I wish more camera/camcorder manufacturers would catch on to the fact that we consumers like to remove the battery and put it into a separate wall charger without having to lug around wires, an AC transformer, etc. Kodak has gotten this part right. I also recommend the separate custom made leather case that they sell. This fits the camera snugly and offers a lot of protection in a very compact package. One last positive note is the battery life. I had one fully charged battery last through approximately 150 flash pictures and it had plenty of life to spare. This is a very positive feature for this size camera.<br /><br />In fairness, I have not tested this camera with the docking station or with any of the EasyShare software which is supposed to be a major selling point of this Kodak line. I am just not that type of user. I prefer to remove the SD card and load my pictures to my computer using a card reader where I can manipulate them. But, even if these EasyShare features are flawless, it would not make up for the lousy flash pictures and the all too often blur. Nothing, not even ergonomic design, can make up for bad pictures. And, unfortunately, that's just what this camera takes.<br /><br />What if you only use it outdoors? Well, then this camera would be a winner. But, I'll go out on a limb and say that the majority of the point-and-shoot market will not be limiting themselves to outdoor shots. That said, Kodak really missed the mark on this one. Which is really dissapointing to me because they passed up a golden opportunity to make the perfect digital camera.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board...","All of the kodak easyshare cameras are different in one way or the other. This one is a sleek, portable camera and takes incredibly high resolution pics with its 5.0 mp and its easy to use functions. I had no idea a digital camera could create such colorful realistic looking pics after owning a sony \"fits in your biggest suitcase and converts to a floppy bigger than your computer camera\". My sister owns a sony cybershot which she brought over for thanksgiving to show us, it printed out pics with a decent quality but no where near this beautiful color pictures that just overwhelm me every time i look at them. The printer that you can purchase for this in my oppinoun isnt a good idea, even though it prints out on a glossy and incredibly good quality than a camera which has to be developed, colorful and the size of a actual photo you develop at your nearby wallgreens. Yet it cost 25 bucks for a 40 picture print catrige becuase it doesnt run on a inkjet it usues its special product in which your would averagly have to pay for 25 bucks every month which is 65 cents a print! when you can just go buy some glossy paper put in your home printer and print out almost practicly near good quality as the pic, i wont lie if you wanna blow 150 for the printer and then 25 bucks for 40 pics either your a sucker or you are incredibly picky about quality, if so buy the thing its a cute looking accesorie that fits near your computer to make you look orginized and proffesional. If i had to choose between this or the cybershot which is a big competitor i would go with this no question.","This camera is easy to use and takes great pictures. It comes with software that makes the transfering of pictures into the computer very simple.<br /><br />I also got it because it was small. It's a good size, I can put it in my pocket or pocket book becuase it doesn't take up much space.","First off, I'd like to qualify myself by saying that I know quite a bit more than the average person about digital cameras. It's really hard to believe someone who says a camera is \"great\" or \"the best\" when they really have no experience with other cameras.<br /><br />  The LS753 is extremely easy to learn how to operate, has a VERY nice compact metal body, and is a great value at 5 megapixels for it's price tag.  Picture quality is pretty good, and colors are well saturated.  Redeye is surprisingly good for a compact camera, and there are plenty of scene modes.  Controls include: Exposure compensation, ISO, white balance(no custom), and long shutter for night scenery without using the flash (remember to use a tripod or steady surface!).  The editing software that comes with it is pretty useful if you have non, and replacement batteries are cheap.  The movie mode is also slightly about average.<br /><br />Downsides:  my biggest complaint is that pretty much everything resets when you turn the camera off, so by the time you set up your camera, the moment might be gone - very frustrating!  the date and time even reset when you leave the battery out too long!  there are no fast shutter or aperture controls, and no AF assist lamp so you can't take focused shots in \"dim\" light without the flash.  Not so great if you take lots of macro shots since all you'll see is flash glare.  Also, by saying \"dim\" lighting, I mean indoors, daytime, during the summer without DIRECT or very bright sunlight.  There's also a bit of purple fringing.<br /><br />Overall, a great camera if you just need it for point and shoot use.  Very nice colors and great resolution for the price.  In my opinion, one of the best things about this camera is the non existent redeye, since compact cameras are usually used for taking pictures of people, not scenery.  Other compacts have awful redeye.  Not recommended for creative shooting though.  The Canon ELPH S410 is about the same price but is 1 meg lower, has no scene modes or an action mode, but focuses better in low light and has better picture quality.  Sony W1 costs more and has limited control over shutter and aperture settings, and has an excellent movie mode.  Canon Powershot A75, A85, and A95 cameras have much more manual controls (which means you can take better pictures in different situations) and are much cheaper (except for the A95) but are bigger, though not too big.","When I purchased this camera I had no idea what I was looking for or how to even go about researching.  This camera turned out to be excellent.  It takes movies, and great clear pictures.  It has a lot of featurs including black and white, sepia, strobe, etc.  There are so many features!  Also the size is really great, not too big and not so small that I'll loose it.  I also bought the printing dock which charges your camera and hooks into your computer.  I can print 4x6 pictures or smaller and it is amazing quality.  If anyone out there is looking for a great digital camera with a lot of features that is easy to use, definetly go with this one."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 2200","amazon_reviews":["I've had this camera for seven years now, it's STILL working! the only problem is that the lens no longer closes and it's starting to take blurry photos, probably as a result of the lens getting scratched up. aww.<br /><br />all in all, this has been a perfect little camera for me. it was my first digital camera ever and I've never had problems with it until recently, which is surely due to its age.<br /><br />the only odd part about it is that while it makes videos, it doesn't record sound. Always thought that was sorta pointless.<br /><br />I'm planning on buying another Nikon to replace it soon, but I'm still going to keep this little guy by my side until it finally dies.","I got this camera used last year for $5.00. At that time teh battery compartment was loose and you needed a rubber band around it tio kee in the batteries, but it worked very well. The only manual I had was on disk. I could not readily follow it when it was printed out. Now I think I could understand it better.<br /><br />This camera has more features that you think.<br /><br />Although made in 2004, this is more than adequate for most purposes. It uses regular size SD cards. I did not get the cable, but you can buy SD card readers or multi card type readers. You can get a reader just for SD cards for $3.00 or less at a computer fare or on Ebay. A multi-purpose reader should get cost you around $8 or so. You can then transfer pictures to your computer. You can also have pictures read and printed at places like Rite Aid.<br /><br />SD cards are now much bigger than when this camera came out, and I quickly replaced the 16 megabyte SA card with a 1 gigabyte one. The camera can take also a 2 gigabyte card. You won't need to replace the card for a long long time, like a year or two. The camera will probably break before the card is full. You can put the card in another Nikon camera and it will take up where it left off.<br /><br />The camera keeps a continous log of all pictures that it has ever taken up to the number 9999. That number is the last 4 digits of the file name before the extension. (Most files are *.JPGs, but teh mtion pictures are *.MOV files also called Quicktime)<br /><br />The pictures are saved in a directory or folder called 100NIKON. That continues until it has 200 pictures. Then it goes to 101NIKON and so on up to 999NIKON although I don't know if that number has been reached by anyone anywhere in the world. Anytime a picture with a lower number than the highest number in the highest numbered directory is added to the SD card, a new directory or folder is also created. So when I copied some older pictures to the SD card, keeping the old numbers they were put in a new directory (or folder) even thiouygh there were only 3 pictures in the old one.<br /><br />If you switch cameras and the new camera has a higher number than the old one, it will add the pictures in the same place - otherwise it wil create a new folder.<br /><br />You can also add other pictures to the card but put them in a different directory than what Nikon uses or you might not be able to see many pictures in your viewfinder. You can also use the the SD card in its reader (that you buy) as an ordinary flash drive as some people have discovered and it is probably better than a regular flash drive in that you don't have to worry about damaging the connection to the USB port.<br /><br />You should copy the pictures to a computer for safety and backup. You can use any kind of program to look at the pictures and you can view small images of the pictures in the camera itself.<br /><br />There is a very big problem with all digital cameras. The LCD screen can break. It can break rather soon and apparently Nikon does not repair it for free considering it the result of mishandlingh and not copvered by its warranty. I encountered other people who had the same problem of an LCD camera breaking.<br /><br />For this reason I recommend buying a 4 or 5 year old camera on Ebay and replacing it if the LCD breaks.<br /><br />After using this camera about half a year the LCD screen suddenly stopped working. (I think it got pressed the wrong way in my coat pocket when i was sitting in a bus) The camera is not useless then, and there is no need to throw it over a bridge. Pictures are much more likely be overexposed then (if taken outside) and you get no immediate feedback then, even feedback as to that a picture was successfully taken and it is very hard to get any pictures out of internal memory then. I took some pictures after the LCD screen (viewfinder) broke and I found it took very good pictures indoors.<br /><br />I bought a Nikon 3200 for about $40 including shipping on Ebay. This is almost the same except that it can take video with sound. If I knew how to do that. Maybe it is automatic.<br /><br />If you get this camera you will be discovering new features for quite some time.","I use this at my office to photograph skin problems and record them in my patients' charts.  excellent macro mode and clear clean detail.<br /><br />inexpensive 2 megapix but functionally great and simple.","i was skeptical due to friends advice to get the most pixels- but i only take pics for fun and send them to family through email :) its great! and petite like me :)highly recommended for an amateur as their first camera!","I purchased this camera as a gift for my wife.

Just the indoors bother me a bit.<br /><br />- Flash takes loooooong time to re-charge, so you will be disappointed when you want to take fast snaps.<br /><br />- Battery life could be better.","After doing weeks of research online, I finally took the plunge<br /><br />and purchased the Coolpix 2200. It's stylish, compact, and very<br /><br />easy to use. It literally took me less than 10 minutes from the<br /><br />time I opened the package to the time I started snapping pictures.<br /><br />It's my first digital camera, and I'm very impressed. The price<br /><br />is reasonable (under $150) for the many features it contains. Highly recommended!","It is amazing how many features Nikon squeezed into this camera for a retail price of only $150 . It blows away cameras that cost twice as much. There is a cd-rom that walks you through how to use your new camera. With 15 scene modes, 3x optical,internal memory and SD card slot you'll love this camera. This is my fourth digital camera, and propably my last until I feel I need or am ready for a Digital SLR. Read the rest of these reviews, check Consumer Reports this camera is a steal. Digital point and shoot cameras by nature use more power then film cameras so get a couple pair rechargeable batteries.","I bought this camera through Amazon after careful consideration. I researched cameras within my price range and I was debating between this camera and one with a 3 megapixel of a different brand. The reviews for this one sold me, and I bought it. I am quite pleased with this camera. Although it is 2 megapixels, the picture quality is excellent -- even better than my old Sony camera which was a 3 megapixel. The pictures turn out crisp and clear even on a lower resolution setting. Another thing I like about the camera is the weight. Or should I say, the lack of weight. It is the lightest camera of a decent size that I've held thus far. This makes it extremely portable. The settings are also excellent. There is a mode where you can choose a particular light setting and shutter speed based on the type of envrionment you are in (eg: party, fireworks, cloudy, sunrise, sunset...) The bottom line is that this camera is great. When you go with a brand like Nikon that ONLY makes cameras, you know that they know what they are doing.","I bought one of these a couple months ago, and I think it's great. I have considerable experience with an older 1.4 MP Olympus, and also a 2 MP Casio and a 4 MP Minolta, and this beats the heck out of all of them.<br /><br />It's far smaller and handier than any of them.<br /><br />It's much cheaper than those cameras were new.<br /><br />It has optical zoom, which I believe is much superior to digital zoom and probably makes this equal in many ways to a 3+ megapixel camera with only digital zoom.<br /><br />It takes SUPER close-up pictures of flowers, fingerprints, etc.<br /><br />It takes pictures in near-total darkness -- while hand held no less -- that appear adequately sharp and much brighter than the scenes appeared to my eyes when I took them.<br /><br />It takes great photos of fireworks without any special setting.<br /><br />Unlike the other digital cameras I used before, it DOES NOT exaggerate the contrast between sunlit and shaded areas. No more faces turned into featureless blackness by what appeared to my eyes to be minor shadows.<br /><br />The power switch is a good design -- it's recessed and separate from the rotary mode switch. Some other cameras I've used or looked at had exposed power switches or had \"OFF\" as one of many positions on an easily-bumped rotary mode switch. The way all digital cameras eat batteries, you don't want to turn them on by accident.<br /><br />On the down side, it could have had snappier \"clicks\" on the mode switch to avoid the minor annoyance of turning on the camera in the wrong mode. It could have had a handy switch to turn the display screen off, allowing you to save power while taking pictures with the viewfinder. The viewfinder could be sealed against the entry of dust better; some dust got into mine. And it could have come with a case, which I know they could have made in China for less than a dollar.<br /><br />But overall I think this is a great camera and an excellent compromise between price, quality, and size. I use it largely for e-mailing photos of my life in Japan back to my family, but it has enough of those pixel things to make decent-sized prints too. I recommend it highly.","I have only had my Nikon Coolpix for 2 weeks but I have already done so much with it!  This is a great camera if you want to e-mail pictures to family and friends and the prints come out great too!  I am a complete beginer and I was pretty much able to use this camera right out of the box.  You really should purchase rechargable batteries and a memory card in order to maximize the time you can spend taking pictures.  There are features I am sure I haven't used yet but I have been having so much fun just taking candid shots.  My first 35mm camera was a Nikon & after using both cameras I won't ever purchase another brand!","I received this camera in the mail today after about 3 months of researching for the right one.  I finally decided to get this one along with the Viking secure digital card for a total of about $150 (including the rebate).  It truly does help to skim through the manual to get a hang of the camera.  The CD-ROM will cover the rest!<br />Here are some specs:<br />Pros:<br />> Scene selection allows you to choose the specific function for specific occasions (museum, party, sunset, etc.)<br />> Warnings for if the picture might get blurry or if lighting is poor<br />> Ergonomic design allows easy handling<br />> Great CD-ROM that gives a good rundown on the camera and the program it comes with<br />> Battery power is quite impressive, I've spent all day taking pictures and it's still going strong<br />> Relatively light and compact<br />Cons:<br />> Functions may be a little overwhelming for a first-timer<br />> Nowadays, 2 MP may not be enough even for the average amateur photographer<br />> LCD screen gets a little grainy sometimes<br />Overall, this is a good digital camera for recreational purposes.  For me, I found the camera was a good deal for the price.  I was especially pleased by the \"panorama\" option that lets you take a series of pictures and arrange them into a 360 degree panorama in the Nikon View program.  There are definitely lots of possibilities with this little camera!","I Bought this camera to upgrade my one-year old Olympus D520. Compared to D520, coolpix 2200 gives more options for exposure, which produces more realistic color picture. I like the design and color of the camera body. Most importantly, the quality of photo is amazing in most cases. It is truly good product from Nikon name.<br />Two minor things that I do not like are: there is no botton to turn on/off LCD (2100 has it). And transferring photos from camera to PC is not easy as Olympus D520. The software included needs to be improved. But these are minors and I can live on.","Let me preface this review by saying that this is my first digital camera.<br />Being a longtime Nikon film camera user I began researching digital cameras. Using Consumer Reports, E-pinions, megapixel.net, and the reviews that I read here, it was clear that a 2-3 MP camera would suffice for my needs as they would any person whose prints rarely exceed 5X7 or 8X10. Don't be wooed by the store salesmen, some of them are honest and knowledgable but not all. Do the research and figure out what equipment will best suit your needs.<br />I found this camera and a 256MB SD memory card for two-hundred and ten dollars (including rebates.)<br />The camera is quite small and fits neatly in my backpack (in a carrying case), uses AA batteries (rechargeable recommended) and the memory card can be purchased almost anywhere. I've had the camera for a week and have taken it everywhere I go. The detail and picture quality are superb. I went to a Butterfly Conservatory and the pictures are just awesome, the color, clarity and detail can rival some of my friends 'high-end' cameras. As a few other reviewers have indicated Nikon has packed the camera with tons of extras. Take the time and read the manual. You'll be a better picture taker because of it.<br />All in all, without plunking down loads of cash, this is an excellent entry-level digital camera that makes learning the ins and outs lots of fun!","The design of this Nikon entry level camera is anything but \"entry\". It shares the same excellent body and Nikkor lens as the 3MP Cooolpix 3200 and 4MP 4100, which cost up to 2 times the price. Using an analogy to cars, it's like getting a $10,000 car that shares the same chassis and design as a fancier, souped-up $20,000 variant.<br />The trend to smaller cameras and camcorders, as well as cost savings, means that the CCD is getting tinier. The 2200 uses 1/3.2\" CCD, while most are 1/2.7\" (as in 3200). Smaller CCD means more noise, so 2200 shoots mostly in ISO 50 to minimize noise, unless in low light when it falls back to ISO 200 - extremely noisy picture. A year ago, most cameras had 1/1.8\" CCD, although noise reduction wasn't as advanced back then, so the results should be similar. The Coolpix is ideal for outdoor daytime shots, but don't expect too much indoors or at night.<br />(Sidenote: Panasonic first achieved an under $1000 3CCD camcorder by reducing the CCD size. No 3 CCD setup has used such a tiny imager, and the compromise was not enough resolution for adequate digital image stabilization.)<br />Smaller CCDs also allows smaller zoom lenses, but relatively, they must be made with more precision as small distortions will be less tolerable than on a larger lens set. The lens on the 2200 seems fine to me. What I first thought as lens softness is actually the severe JPEG compression... I prefer 2 Mega Pixel jpegs of about 1000KB, but the 2200 squeezes it to 500~700KB each. Memory is so cheap these days, and hopefully the compression ratio can be relaxed in future firmware upgrades.<br />Strangely, some Coolpix 2200/3200/4100 I saw are Made in Japan, while some are Made in China. This indicates that the series is either made by Nikon itself, or at least by a quality Japanese OEM maker such as Sanyo. Even if you get one made in China, it's good to know that it comes from a factory operated by Nikon or Sanyo, not sourced from an unknown OEM, as is common in this price range.<br />I also looked at an alternative \"budget\" digital camera, the Optio 30 by Pentax. It's a 3-Megapixel camera that costs $30 more. It is not as elegant in design as the Coolpix 2200, but it does have 2 important features. One is live histogram, which shows you if the exposure is favorable. The other feature is automatic interval shooting (Lapse-time Photography). You can set the Pentax to shoot a picture every X seconds. Subjects of the sequence can be a flower budding, your pet running around the house while you're out, the sunset, your documented trip to the supermaket (camera mounted inside the car windshield), or, if you have an radio controlled helicopter/plane/blimp, a bird's eye view (you don't need an extra radio channel to trigger the camera). Since you can take about 300 2-megapixel pictures with the 256MB card, without the cost of film, you can really set the camera to work automatically and forget about it.<br />If you're after a simple camera for 4 X 6\" prints that's designed like a jewel, I recommend the Coolpix 2200. If you want to explore advanced features digital photography offers, get the Pentax, although you will have to give up the curvy, grip-friendly design for a boxy one.","This camera is the one to stop on!!!  If you're like me, you may be  completely overwhelmed by all of the choices in digital cameras.  I finally found this one on another site, and then came back here to read the reviews (the price was better too).  I got it two days after my daughter was born, and found out how quickly you can use up a memory card and batteries!<br />The pictures have been great!  I got the cheepest 64mb SD card I could find ($28) and a set of ni-mh rechargeable batteries for $10.  They both work great with the camera.  The card holds about 75 pictures and the batteries will last through about two cards between charges.  Since the set came with four batteries, I'm always charged!  I've already printed off some 8x10's and they're in perfect shape.<br />If you are looking for an inexpensive, easy to use, great quality camera, this is the one!","For those who want everything but could care less about superfluous ultra high-end features; this is your digital camera. The 2 megapixel resolution is more than enough in my opinion. This is obviously not the camera for you if you are a design professional that needs the absolute top-of-the-line features, but for the rest of us, this camera is gold. There are a hefty amount of cool features, and the image quality is amazing.  I am a computer artist and very demanding of my tools - this camera not only met my expectations - but exceeded them. Buy with confidence and without trepidation!","I would give this baby a 5 star rating but for the quality of indoor photos. Otherwise, it is just about right for one's everyday, lay-person needs. Has some very cool features (like the 6 color options, 15 scene modes and assists). size is just right for discrete stow-away in small bags and purses.<br />The blur warning comes on almost all the time when indoors in poor light. even with the flash, photos may turn out grainy.<br />movies are of decent quality - considering it's not a video camera. the menus and features are quite user friendly.<br />have not yet figured out what type/brand of rechargeable batteries to buy - due to grim warnings in manual regarding usage of anything other than nikon's own line. has insatiable apetite for alkaline batteries. the other option - CRV3 batteries  - are quite expensive. manual is not clear on how much (if at all) the battery life would improve over regular alkalines. other than that, the manual is easy to follow and comprehensive. software package is easy to install and effortless to use.(...)","For anyone mainly going to make small prints, put snapshots on the web or Email to friends and family, 2 megapixels is just right. I think 3 times optical zoom also falls into the same use category. The major camera manufacturers all have models like this in the same price range. I shopped around for a digital camera for quite a while and I bought the Nikon Coolpix 2200 and I highly recommend it as a high quality point and shoot camera.<br />Pros:<br /> - Nikon has a great reputation.<br /> - It takes consistently good pictures in Automatic mode.<br /> - The menus are very readable and easy to navigate.<br /> - It comes with rechargeable bateries and a charger.<br /> - It is nice and small but easy to grip.<br /> - It feels solid and well made.<br /> - It has a 2-year warranty<br />Cons:<br /> - NikonView software is not compatible with Windows 98 (my computer)<br /> - No manual shutter or aperture adjustment<br />Most of my pictures so far have been taken in Auto mode. There are lots of settings and options but it takes a while to get used to them. The camera offers scene modes that let you compensate for different lighting conditions. I took a picture of my house with the sun behind it and surprise, the house is all in shadows. Alot of my pictures were improved by using different settings the camera offers.<br />Compared to other digitals, this camera has minimal delay in taking pictures. You can shoot a picture in about one and a half seconds or use one of the options to shoot continuous pictures. The best shot selector mode automatically picks the clearest shot for you.<br />Another thing I'm happy about. Some cameras have lots of people complaining about their camera eating up batteries. I have been fooling around with the Nikon for about a week and taken hundreds of pictures and some movies too. Following a full charge, the low battery warning came on after a few days of almost constant use and then lasted for almost another day before it stopped working. The batteries and charger that come with it seem great. A full recharge only takes about two hours.<br />My computer has Windows 98 so I can't use the Nikon software or download pictures directly from the camera to my computer. I can't use the camera's internal memory so I had to buy a memory card and card reader. The 128 MB card seems quite adequate too. The setting I am using gives me about 125 pictures per card.","I have an HP 315 and this new Nikon absolutely blows it away and it was like $150.00 less that I paid just 2 years ago.  Easy to setup. Great picture quality and the flash is much much better than others I've tried.<br />Nikon has a great track record. I think this camera bolsters that attention to detail.","This is a feature packed little camera.  I liked the cameras small size.  I'm quite happy with the image quality of a printed 8x10.  I don't have a use for anything larger.  I found a couple of the features very useful.  Best shot selector shoots up to 10 still images then saves the sharpest.  Nice for intances where you can't use flash or can't see the LCD screen.  The camera can make a copy your pictures in a lower resolution. Just select the smaller size and the image is ready for email.  I found the 3X zoom a bit small, maximum focal length is 14.1mm  I've seen 2X cameras with more magnification.  The flip of that is the wide angle is real wide.  The macro setting can shoot incredibly close.  1 inch or 1 foot when zoomed.  The camera did have a little trouble locking foucus in macro mode when subject(flower) did not fill image area.  Focused great otherwise.  I will use this camera for quick shots when I don't want lug out the SLR.","I wanted a simple point-and-shoot camera that I could leave on auto mode most of the time. This camera takes sharp pictures and works well in auto mode IF you are outdoors or have lots of daylight coming through a window when you are indoors. If you are indoors with poor lighting, using the flash sometimes results in either dim or very cold pictures. What I do when I am indoors is turn off the flash and increase the exposure compensation by +1.0 EV or so. You'll have to hold the camera still or the blur detection will come on giving you the option to save or delete the picture. Or you can use the Best Shot Selector to take up to 10 pictures continuously, then it only saves the clearest one. Pictures come out warm and natural looking without the flash. You can also experiment with the indoor or night portrait assist modes to get similar results. Here are some other thoughts on the camera:<br />Pros:<br />- The scene modes work suprisingly well.<br />- VERY small, light and compact.<br />- Zoom can be seen with optical viewfinder.<br />- Camera has one-button instant auto-transfer. USB transfer is quick.<br />- Haven't tried an SD card yet, but pictures are written quickly to the internal memory.<br />- Price. Got it for $155 total<br />Cons:<br />- No button to turn LCD on and off. Must go to setup menu.<br />- Weak flash with short range.<br />- Viewfinder is inaccurate. Cuts off the edges. LCD is fine, though.<br />- Hard to hold if you have big hands.<br />- Alkalines die fast. Get some NiMH rechargebles.<br />- Wristrap is useless and just gets in the way. Wish it came with a neck strap.<br />- NikonView software is sparse. You will definitely want Photoshop or PSP. Did come with Arcsoft PhotoImpressions 4.0, though.<br />I thought about getting the 3.2 MP 3200 for $70 more but settled with this camera since I rarely do 8x10, didn't have a need for more detail, and just wanted a casual point-and-shoot. 3200 also has sound, voice memo, and AF assist lamp. Not a big lost to me but some might want the extra features.<br />Lastly, you will want a small bag like the Tamrac 4390. Fits the camera like a glove.","I recently had problems with my Kodak CX6230 and finally ended up exchanging it for the Nikon 2200 and I am so happy I did.  It is smaller and has far more features.  Some that stand out are color modes in addition to standard are BW, Sepia, cyan, and vivid color.  There are also 15 scene modes which adjust the camera's settings for certain circumstances such as on a beach or indoors with low lighting.  Two things that definitely stand out are the panorama feature which allows you to take multiple photos which you can later overlap and form one long photo (it shows you a faint copy of your previous shot so you can line it up perfectly) and also the multi-shot feature which takes 16 shots in a very short time and gives you all of them in one frame which is fun.  The buttons are easy to use and although there are tons of menu options, you can stick with the auto mode which is quite simple.  This camera works well for a beginner or advanced user.  Finally, don't be turned off by the 2.0MP.  Prints come out great up to 8x10.  This camera is amazing.  I recommend it over the Kodak CX6230 (which is good but has less features and shorter battery life), Canon A60 (which has a LONG lag time between pressing the shutter and the shot being taken),  and HP 635 which are other cameras I researched and tried out."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 3200","amazon_reviews":["Looked good but would NOT function at all.

Get it for a good price!","As an occasional and novice photographer, I've held off on getting a digital camera simply because I couldn't justify the cost. When circumstances arose that required me to have a digital camera, I set a low budget and checked the Amazon Marketplace. This camera (Nikon Coolpix 3200) is exactly what I need: low price, easy to use, and basic features. I'll have to look into rechargeable batteries, a memory card, and a camera bag, but the basic camera has been just fine thus far.","This is a terrific little camera with excellent photo results. Easy to use and carry along, uses regular batteries as well. You can't go wrong with a Nikon!","this camera took really nice pictures in good light..and ok pictures in the dark.  Upgraded and decided to go with another brand and have totally regretted that decision.  From now on i will stick to the good that i know and buy Nikon.","excellent camera, value for money<br />unfortunately, the camera is not available as new anywhere anymore","I don't think Nikon is making this camera any more, but for the two years I've had it, it's served me well.  I've dropped it multiple times (once so hard that the batteries and card popped out), and I've taken pictures in the rain/snow several times.  There is dust/condensation in the manual viewfinder because I have neglected to protect it from sudden changes in temperature.  A few times, it has turned on while in my pocket.  Despite all my inadvertant abuse, it continues to take fairly good pictures (considering that it's a 3MP point-and-shoot).  The 2048x1536 resolution makes for nice smaller photos, and if you use the macro setting, you can even have some control over the depth of field (although the setting is rather fussy).<br /><br />I never got the software that came with it to work, so I just plug in the Nikon and use iPhoto.<br /><br />As an amateur photographer, I find this camera fairly limiting, but for straightforward documentation (of, say, family or friend-style events), it does what it's supposed to do.","I bought the 3200 new and it was a love hate relationship.<br /><br />It was an early adopter model with many drawbacks.<br /><br />Its dismal batery life was only matched by its lathargic performance.<br /><br />in other words it ate up batterys quick and took pictures S L O W L Y.<br /><br />It is now relegated to service as the kids camera when batterys are plentiful.","I got this camera a couple of weeks ago from my dad whose had it for 2 years. Takes great pictures (very clear and in focus). However, the screen blacks out for a few seconds after taking pictures so if you want to take a series of pictures within a short time, use the motion setting. Also, indoor pictures are sometimes blurry. But overall a good camera that takes awesome pictures for the price.","I love this camera.  I have owned it for about 1.5 years, and it has worked flawlessly.  My only complaint is that when you take videos with it, you can hear a repetitive clicking sound during periods when the recorded sound is quiet.  Of course, with all the great camcorders out there, this should not be an issue for most users.  However, sometimes you don't have your camcorder with you and you want to capture a funny or interesting spontaneous event.  This camera is great for that.  The quality of the videos reminds me of the home movies of the 1960's and 1970's.  There is a certain charm in having your videos not be \"perfect\" all the time, and thus I like it for that reason.  The stills are great, the camera is very user friendly, and downloads to your PC are simple.  Finally, buy the Panasonic 2100 NiMH batteries; they last a very long time without needing recharged.  Enjoy!","I got this camera about 2 years ago; at the time it cost $350, which was actually reasonable considering the quality of the device. The screen is clear, the buttons are easy to press, and the camera takes AMAZING PICTURES, especially for only 3.2 MP. At the time, 3.2 MP was considered \"good,\" but now I imagine most people would say that it is a low resolution; most cameras now come with around 6 MP. Well, now that this camera is slightly outdated, the price has dropped tremendously, and it is  a great buy. Trust me, no one really needs 6 megapixels; I've already blown pictures from this camera up to 8x12 and they look gorgeous; no pixelization or anything.<br /><br />This camera is so easy to use. I would definitely recommend it to a beginner, or anyone who is looking for quality at a fair price. It is completely full-featured, including tons of different scene modes, as well as \"scene assist\" which can make taking portraits and landscape/wraparound photos easy. It comes bundled with several high-quality software packages as well.","I've had this camera for about a year and I love it! The features and functions are easy to use, downloading and prnting pictures is a snap, batteries last a long time. I can't think of a single complaint! An excellent camera for a low price!","This is a pretty good little camera. It was my first digital camera...a christmas present last year. It has had some good use. It's great for a beginner or something light to take on a trip--I got tired of lugging around my SLR, tripod, bag, lenses, etc. I would actually maybe give this 3 3/4 ;) stars, but that is not an option. There are many times I would take a picture and the screen would blackout for a good couple of seconds before returning to ready mode for another shot, this can be quite annoying, but somewhat expected with a digicam. It is easy to take out of focus shots, so a steady hand is a must. The flash is somewhat limited. The video mode is not very good and the sound quality is horrible, but that's not what I got the thing for, but for what it is, it's doable. If that's what I was looking for though, I would have got myself a video camera. The 256 MB card gives me well over 240 shots...plenty for the moment. It's easy to use and very compact. A good buy for the price!!","Aside from the poor picture quality that you get when taking indoor pictures (or anywhere with little light exposure), this camera is GREAT! It took beautiful, and lively pictures outdoors, but I was extremely disappointed with the picture quality when pictures were being taken indoors or where there wasn't too much light. I tried all the different modes on the camera while trying to take pictures indoor and where there were limited light exposure, but it made the pictures worse. The night flash on the camera made the pictures really blurry and not very pretty at all.<br /><br /> If you plan to take pictures indoor or at night time, this camera probably isn't for you. Otherwise, it's a great camera.","First off let me say that I love this camera. It really is a lot of fun to take pictures, especially with all the wonderful features it has to offer. However, there are a few problems I have with it.<br /><br />For one, after you take a picture, sometimes there is a black screen for about 8 seconds and you can't do anything until the screen comes back. Maybe it takes a little while for the picture to properly register in the play menu, I'm not sure. But it can be frustrating when someone is waiting for you to hurry up and take their picture.<br /><br />Another thing, I have noticed on the movie mode that after you have recorded something and you're playing it back, there is a clicking noise in the background. The first time I heard it I thought it might be just the background noise of what I had recorded. But it kept doing that no matter where I was or what I recorded. It's not too loud and you can still hear what really happens in your movie, but it is definately noticeable. One good thing about the movie mode though is that it lasts a very long time. You can take very long films.<br /><br />Also, I find it hard to control the focus at times. It's more if I'm taking a closeup of something, like a flower or a leaf, and sometimes it won't focus on the flower or leaf. It might focus on something beyond it, and my picture turns out fuzzy. I was taking a photo once at a peculiar angle of this tree branch, but it would not focus on the branch. It kept focusing on the tree trunk behind it. I must have took about 20 pictures, trying to get one of the branch, but what would've been an awesome picture never turned out.<br /><br />One more thing, and I don't know if this is just a glitch in my camera alone, or if it has happened with others, but sometimes the screen will just freeze. It's usually after I take a picture on one particular mode. It's weird. About half of the picture I just took will be on the screen, and it is slightly transparent. The other half is normal. Also, when it is like that, I cannot zoom in or out. I can only take another picture exactly how it is. The only way to get it off is to put it in play mode and then back to picture mode. I haven't heard any other complaints about that, so it might just be my camera alone that does this, I don't know.<br /><br />Overall, it is a fairly nice camera. It's very small, lightwait, and I carry it everywhere with me. It takes some very nice pictures, and the colors turn out abosutely fabulous! They're always really clear pictures. I highly recommend this camera for the casual photographer. It's a camera for a beginner, and it's easy to use. If you are the serious photographer though, I would advise you go with something else. To get the high quality pictures you're looking for, there are probably better cameras out there. But for this price, it's not too bad. Once in a while though, this little camera will surpise you and produce a photograph that is truly amazing.","What an awsome little camera.  This is my first digital camera and I am very impressed with the features it offers.  I am shocked by all that I got compared with similar priced digital cameras.  It was very easy to use and there was only a slight learning curve coming from a 35MM camera.  This camera takes great pictures in low light, I can use it in the dark and the pictures come out bright as in daylight (using the flash of course).  Just recently had a baby and we use it to take pictures of him daily and discovered this camera is a battery killer.  Even though it's a battery drainer, I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />By the way - this camera isn't really for large moving objects.  I used this camera for my brothers wedding and almost cried when I saw my pictures.  They were very blurry and when taking pictures on road trips of scenery.<br /><br />All in all this is a great little everyday camera.  I absoutely love the video feature.  I've gotten the cutest clips of our baby when I am taking pictures.<br /><br />You shouldn't be disappointed with this great camera.","I previously owned the Coolpix 2100 and I upgraded to the 3200 because I wanted a little bit higher resolution and movies with sound.<br /><br />For the most part, I'm satisified with the upgrade.  The images are clear and crisp and movie function is ten times better than the 2100.  The 3200 allows for 640 x 480 movies and the duration is only limited by memory capacity.  With a 512MB card you've got about 15 minutes of recording time.  That might sound small, but it's more than enough to capture important moments.<br /><br />Another improvement over previous models was that Nikon moved most of the controls from the top of the camara to the back.  As a semi-pro 35mm user I balked at this at first.  Then the utility of this change became obvious - it's just plain easier to have most of the controls right there alongside the LCD viewer.<br /><br />I used the 2100 for Internet shots for auctions and for emailing photos to others.  You don't need lots of megapixels for such uses - even the 2100 is overkill.  Still, it's great to have a camera that allows you to go beyond that and actually print your work.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I found the 3200 to be actually slower than the 2100 in terms of writing to media!  I have one of the fastest cards available so the memory card shouldn't be an issue.  I wasn't impressed.  I don't recommend this camera for situations where you want to take multiple shots seconds apart.<br /><br />Another drawback on this model is that the microphone picks up autofocus noise in the movie mode.  It's quite loud, actually.  It's possible to turn off the autofocus which creates a more blurry image.  Still, the quality of the movies is already low enough that this effect seems to be small.  (Like most digital photo models, the 3200 will not give you camcorder results.)<br /><br />Overall, the 3200 is a great bargain.  It's just enough for printing small photos and it delivers a lot of great features at an affordable price.  Just like the 2100 and other similar Coolpix models, it's compact and feels comfortable to hold.  (I've found the similarily sized Canon digital cameras to be awkward at best.)  Still, this is a camera for folks on a budget.  I know that when it comes time to upgrade again I'll be looking at models with faster read and write times and more megapixels.","I must preface my review by saying that I am a point and shoot camera user and that this is my first digital camera.  thus I'm not an expert when it comes to either photography or digital cameras.  Plus,  I got the camera as a gift, so I didn't do any comparisson shopping.<br /><br />With that being said, I like my camera and think that it does a good job.  It is very easy to use.  It has a host of features to enable you to shoot in different scene settings and situations.  Not sure that I'll ever use them, but they're there.<br /><br />I've had it for a little over three months and the only drawbacks that I've observed are 1) it seems to take a while between shots, like 3 maybe 4 seconds and 2) when I turn the flash off my pictures tend to come out a bit blurry.  it says in the manual (and on the camera's screen) that one should use a tripod in this mode.  I don't know maybe I'm doin somethin wrong or just haven't fully read the manual, this could certainly be something that I'm doing wrong and not a fault of the camera.<br /><br />Overall I think that this is a great camera for the point and shoot type like myself.  its nice and small, so carryin it along when you travel or when you're out and about is really no problem.","Great Camera, great pictures, great price you won't go wrong buying this one.The only thing negative I could say is that it does eatAA batteries, but I use my zoom alot.","This is my first digital camera after using an Olympus SLR and Olympus pocket size cameras, and I couldn't be happier with it! The functions were so easy to understand that I only watched the introductory DVD for a few minutes before realizing, \"All the functions on this camera are easy to figure out!\" I love the small size of this camera; it fits in my purse or pocket.  The close up and movie features are fun and easy to use, and the zoom has the perfect range. I got rechargeable batteries for this camera after reading that the batteries that come with this camera aren't the best... and I've been very pleased with how many pictures I can take between charges, even while using the flash most of the time.<br /><br />The only things I'd suggest improving on this camera: the delay between clicking the button and when the picture is snapped could be shorter, and sometimes there's a humming noise when using the movie functionality.<br /><br />I recommend getting the carrying case to provide some extra protection against the elements -- as well as additional memory card(s). The memory card that comes with the camera is only good for the equivalent of about one roll of film, and the carrying case is strong and attractive.","I bought my Nikon Coolpix 3200 right before a trip to Australia. My travel companions had various other cameras, including a 4MP Sony Cybershot that I had seriously considered purchasing. When we compared our photos of the same subjects after the trip, it was amazing how much BETTER my photos turned out to be. They were far clearer and the detail was amazing. I found many of my friends photos to be blurry or over exposed. I'm extremely happy with my Nikon Coolpix purchase.","This is my first digital camera.  The day it arrived my husband and I were leaving for a trip to Jamaica.  A friend of mine already had one, so we ran by her house for some quick tips on the way out of town.  It took her 5 minutes to show me the basics, and I was taking pics like a pro!!!  I love this camera; I've been taking so many more pictures of my kids since I got it.  I highly recommend it especially for people new to digital cameras.  We even recorded a couple of short movies with it in Jamaica.  It's SO easy to use!!!","Got the Coolpix camera last week and used it already indoors and outdoors. For a person who doesn't like to read an encyclopedia of instructions before taking the first pic, this Nikon does a good job being almost intuitive for people like me who just like to take pics, not study engineering science. The pre-set picture modes are generally helpful, but the sports mode doesn't really work for fast action pics, especially if the light is not perfect. I wanted to take pics of my parakeets, they don't just sit there and wait for the camera!!!, so there the camera didn't perform as well as desired. With 256 MG card and Sony rechargeable Ni-MH batteries Nikon 3200 so far has perfomed very well. Whenever flash is used, overexposure is a concern. The main pros being all things small: size, lightweight, simple to use. The picture quality seems very good in digital format and I didn't even use the highest resolution setting. Software is very easy to use, it's \"idiot-proof\" so to say. I have not yet printed out anything, but for the old-fashioned prints I'd rather use my advanced Olympus camera anyway. Can't report on video component since I'd rather use a real dvd camera for that purpose, so for me it doesn't matter if the small Nikon has this feature or no.<br /><br />Among things to be desired - better sports/action mode in less-than-perfect light; less noise for the zoom for discreet seetings like church, exhibition, meeting, museum.<br /><br />Overall, for users who do not expect a CNN cameraperson level of sophistication for mere $181, this Nikon is an excellent buy. It's light and small, and for those seeking these features Nikon 3200 should be great.","Pros<br /><br />1. Ultra-compact size. Believe me SIZE DOES MATTER especially if you like to take it on trips and not feel that you are carrying a burden with you.<br /><br />2. great design.<br /><br />3. intutive menu.<br /><br />4. 15 scenes modes which are more than enough for the amateur casual photographer (families or indiviuals who are not so familiar with the right set of shutter speed and aperature mode setting for a specific snap). For people who are looking for more control (who are really photographers) you should look at digital SLRs. I think by definition ultra compact are for people who just want to point and shoot anything they want without much thinking.<br /><br />The 15 scene modes tell you exactly what settings you need for the specific shot you are taking. It is also very easy to get to them and set. Nothing complex. Intutive !<br /><br />5.good picture quality<br /><br />6.good in low light.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />nothing much. It is the best in its segment of ultra-compacts.<br /><br />For a long time I kept on debating between the coolpix 3200 and its arch rival, the canon A75. I have come to the conclusion that nikon is the best because<br /><br />1. of the smaller size<br /><br />2. the usage of less AA batteries than canon.<br /><br />  (canon - 4, nikon -2)<br /><br />Picture quality is equally good. Again people who need manual control can go to the canon a75 but it is very bulky. point and shoot cameras should always be really point and shoot.<br /><br />Go to the following link for the comparison between the canon a75 and nikon coolpix 3200.<br /><br />[...]","I had a 2 megapixel Kodak camera for about 5 years before it got dropped recently and the battery compartment wouldn't hold the batteries in.  So, off I went to research 3 MP cameras.  I didn't want a high megapixel camera because I never get prints larger than 5x7.  I was on the fence with this and the Kodak CX7330.  I was always happy with the old Kodak I had, which seems to be the only manufacturer that takes true photo aspect pictures.  All the other cameras take the computer VGA ratio (4:3) instead of the photo sizes (4:6 or 5:7).  What really made me choose the Nikon was that they make great lenses and that's what photos are all about, not megapixels.  Kodak is great, but they are a print company really, plus their camera has that horrible \"share\" button that I would never use with their dock.  Also, the Nikon had a slightly smaller size, slightly lighter, had a better LCD screen, and the focus-assist lamp.  That's a must-have for low-light situations and you'll be glad you have it when you really need it.  I'm almost never in good lighting situations.<br /><br />So, I got the Nikon and I'm happy I did.  They have a great product and I was immediately WOWed by the screen.  There's no advertised digital zoom (which you shouldn't use anyway), but it's there.  It has easy to use menus, shooting modes, and GREAT software.  It's simple, to the point, but VERY functional.  I had great enhanced pictures in seconds.  Plus, what I really love is the ability to mark photos with a simple \"check\".  I've been looking for this in other programs and just couldn't find it.  Every few months, my wife and I go through all the pictures we've taken and WRITE DOWN each filename to upload to a photo website.  Other software has similar functions, but you can't view the images full screen.  The thumbnails just don't show enough detail to know if the pic was good or not.  With the Nikon software, you can view fullscreen, mark the shot, then search (via the software) for your marked files and upload them to your favorite photo website.<br /><br />There are lots of other great features like voice-memo and video, but I rarely think I'll use either.  If you're looking for a decent camera, but don't want to spend over $200, get this.  You'll be happy you did!  Sorry Kodak!","I have had this camera for seven months now, and took about 1000 shots traveling for two months.  It is an excellent first digital to learn on - point and shoot while learning bells and whistles.  Incredibly compact and ergonomic too.  Fits like a glove in the hand.  Slides into a tiny Tamrac case that snaps on my belt and I hardly know it's there.  Wear it everywhere (traveling). Unobtrusive for candid shots too.  My pictures are uniformly excellent, better than I've had with film overall.<br /><br />One piece of sage advice I got from a knowledgeable saleslady who uses this camera - use disposable CR-V3 batteries.  About $10 each.  I get 300-400 shots on one and don't have to mess with a recharger.<br /><br />One complaint I have is image noise indoors when I zoom, but I had the same problem with my previous Olympus.  Another complaint is shutter lag.  Forget about taking pictures of people in motion.<br /><br />You can't buy a better digital for less than $200 - or probably $300.  And most of us probably don't need more camera than this.","this was a christmas present to ourselves and we are sooo glad we bought it early!! this little camera is about $200.00 and it has everything you would need (unless you're a professional).<br /><br />we are a family of five and what we really needed was a camera with a sport mode(gymnastics, football, etc)... what we got was even better... a camera that handles motion with no blur, has a fabulous snow mode for super glare conditions(which we are enjoying as we are buried under 29\" of snow in the midwest), one-touch upload on the web, and a menu for all these modes that is extremely easy to navigate. we looked at the sony, fuji and kodak........none of them came close to how this one handles......try them all out but take my word for it....you will love this little camera!!","I love this camera.  Color is great, detail is sharp and is has lots of settings to fiddle with.  The only downside is, yes you may have heard this before, the battery life.  The two that come with it plus an 8 pack of very good batteries lasted exactly 459 shots.  That's about 91.8 shots per set if you are keeping score.  That is with lots of zooming, flashing, and fidgeting with the setting.  BTW if get the \"battery exhausted\" messages appears you can turn it off and let it sit for few minutes and get a few more shots.  The CRC-V3 recharables has lasted 200+ so far (they just came in).  Well worth it.  The flash also charges faster.  The LCD is accurate and has no dead pixels.  It is also smaller than I realized.  Basicly, get this camera, the case, a set of CRC-V3s, and a 256MB SD card and you will have everything you need.","If I only knew that using a digital camera and uploading the photos onto the computer was so painless, I would've bought my first digital camera years ago. I'm also very glad that I made the Nikon 3200 my first digital camera because I own a Nikon F50 and thus am familiar with the kinds of symbols and technology Nikon uses in its products. And the Amazon price is simply unbeatable! Thank you, Nikon, and thank you, Amazon!!!","This is a very nice camera for beginners & for new experts. I took this camera for a recent trip to France and I found the following good and a few bad things.<br /><br />The good things are, it is very compact and easy to carry around, it has a lot of features for an advanced user, uses AA batteries, pictures are of excellent quality and resolution, produces amazing 4x6 prints.<br /><br />Bad things are, it uses a lot of AA batteries (every ~40 shots), no automatic image playback after every shot, with the flash on it takes almost 5 -8 secs for the flash to recharge to take the next picture and at this time you cannot operate the camera in any way (eg., to review picture or change setting etc.,)<br /><br />But the disadvantages are too small comapred to the value of the camera. I give it 5 stars and it is excellent purchase for any body who opts to buy this camera.","My son purchased this camera to replace his film camera which is only 6 months old and now sits in a cupboard and is never used.<br /><br />The camera is very stylish and will fit in the pocket quite easily so there is never an excuse not to have your camera with you.<br /><br />After being used to an SLR (which I was until I purchased the Fuji S5000 last year), the camera initially feels like a toy, but don't be fooled this is a very powerful piece of equipment and you soon get used to its compact size.<br /><br />Nikon has always been there or thereabouts as the top make by people in the know and this little baby carries on their traditions of quality lenses and useful functions (not gimmicks).<br /><br />The image quality of 3.2 megapixels is more than adequate and the 3X optical zoom Nikkor lens is a delight. Nikon have now gone down the road of including 14.5 megabytes of internal memory which is a very good idea. There are enough pre-set modes to satisfy most situations you will encounter.<br /><br />The only gripe I have is that Nikon always used to include batteries and sometimes a charger with their Coolpix range and for some reason they have stopped this.<br /><br />The camera comes with a software disk and and an easy to follow manual.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide out of all the cameras available which one is for you, you won't go wrong with this one.","Got one for my sister as a gift a month ago. She has taken maybe over 200 photographs. Very easy to use. Use it on vivid setting, great results. Very easy to download. Even small videos are nice.<br /><br />Compared picture quality results with a 1300 dollar 8 megapixel camera. We did not see any difference on a 8x11 print and a 1600 x 1400 monitor.<br /><br />Human eye can not see beyond 1500 pixels anyways.<br /><br />Nice size to pocket it. It does goes through battery fast, espl. with flash, use NiMH.<br /><br />Note: If you are a serious photographer use SLR, old fashioned chemical film camera, shadows and colors are just to life like. Digital \"Sc\" has not caught up with it yet.","I was in search of a camera to replace my HP315 (ok, ok stop laughing at me now!) that was about 5 years old. I just decided that I need to start taking more pics of my 5 year old before he's off to college or something!<br /><br />I wanted a camera that was 3MP or so. I didn't want or need anything more than that. Higher MPs just eat up your memory and take forever to download pics via email. I read the Consumers guides, testimonials here on Amazon and went out to look for the best price. My sister has the 3100 so I knew a little bit about the camera as well from using hers and loved it.<br /><br />It's a great little camera with about 16MB of internal memory in case you forgot a SD card or run out. SD cards are dropping in price all the time. But it was the FREE SD card that came with this camera at Amazon that sold me.<br /><br />So now I take pics and stick them on the computer in a slide show so my little guy can see himself and his buddies. He was adorable in his Halloween costume!","I bought this camera especially for taking pictures during my first trip to France. I just wanted something that looked good, had reasonably high picture quality for what I would be using the pictures for, as well as movie and shooting options. The Coolpix 3200 has exceeded my expectations. I have gotten so many compliments on the pictures I've taken. I even blew some up to 8x10 printouts and I only shot them at the 3rd highest quality setting and they still came out great. Easy to use, light weight, couldn't ask for more for the price.","I was hesitant to buy a digital camera. Most I have used have been very confusing to operate. I choose this one mainly for the price, and the Nikon name. I was expecting to not receive a USB cable as well as have a hard time setting it up and figuring it out.<br /><br />I was very happy to find both not to be true. It did ship with a USB cable. Although it is a non-standard one, it has a smaller connector on the camera interface end. Nonetheless it had one. It also shipped with batteries! So it has everything out of the box to start using it. I am not one to read manuals. So true to nature I just unpacked it, popped the batteries in and hit on. It started up quick, quicker then I expected. It was very easy to setup the time, date and such. In less then 3 minutes I had taken my first pic. The two-stage button while not new to me having used an SLR does take a bit of getting used to with the digital. It seems to lag after the auto focus.<br /><br />The Menu structure is easy to navigate and understand. I had no problem finding my way thru the menus. Nikon provides a quick start guide and helps greatly in making the initial user experience excellent. I have not had much time to take many pictures and cannot comment on the quality greatly. The single pic I did take looks great on my MAC, and the 3.2 MP is more then adequate in my opinion based on this one, quick picture.<br /><br />The camera is light, and small, but not so small I feel it's going to slip out of my hand. It has sturdy controls. I had read other reviews commenting that it feels toy like. This is clearly understandable but not so much it's a turn off. Overall I am very happy with this camera. I have never written a product review, but my happy experience with my low expectation prompted me to submit a review. The camera has earned that.","I had my Nikon 3200 for 3 weeks when it malfunctioned. Circuit city would not take it back, so I paid over $10 to ship it to nikon  They returned it the last week of September, with more problems than it had when I sent it. After they ignored my two emails, and a letter to the company, I returned it again. As of this date, October 13, 2004, I have not heard form them. DO NOT BUY NIKON... UNLESS YOU WISH TO SPEND YOUR TIME TRYING TO CONTACT THEM!!!","I've noticed that everyone that has written a bad review for this camera has given it a bad review, only because they have no idea how to use it.  99% of all issues complained about can be fixed simply by reading the instruction manual.<br /><br />I got this camera because it was highly recommended, and it has turned out to be my best camera so far (under $200).  I like the fact that you can record video w/ sound, and that you can format it to record in 3 different sizes.  You can take quickshot sports photos, like the ones used in skateboarding magazines to show shot by shot how the trick is done... very cool!  I also like the fact that you can change the picture size to be anywhere from absolutely ENORMOUS to the regular-sized pictures any other camera would take.  The detail is amazing.  I can focus in on dust particles on my desk!  It also takes shots in Black & White, and other effects.  Sure the camera uses up batteries - it's a digital camera - what digital camera DOESN'T use up batteries???  However, this one doesn't eat batteries like my other cameras do.  And it only takes 2 AA's. I really like this camera.<br /><br />CONS ARE:<br /><br />This camera cannot be used as a webcam.  I unfortunately found that out after I bought it, but it's not something that's going to make me take it back to the store.<br /><br />Video quality is very gritty.  It's nowhere near the quality of a video camera, but it is much better than a video camera phone.  Also, if you leave the auto adjust on, the video records clicking sounds as the camera focuses.  I just turned auto adjust off and it's fine now.<br /><br />This camera isn't going to make you a pro photographer, but it's no piece of crap either!  There are plenty of options and buttons to keep you busy for a every long time learning everything that you can do with it, if you want to get into that.  It's also simple enough to be able to say \"ok, I want to turn this thing on and take a picture\".  I figured out how to take a picture less than a minute after having it out of the box.  Very cool.  Very easy.  If it breaks, I'll let you know.","Pros: Lightweight, inexpensive, great auto features, panoramic pictures, easy to use, long batter life even on alkaline batteries.<br />Cons: Takes noisy videos if you use auto focus mode.<br /><br />I guess one might call me a camera snob.  I am extremely critical and picky when it comes to my digital images.  So for me to rate this as a 5 means a lot to me.  I like to do a lot of photoshop work and artistic shots so pixel quality is extremely important.<br />This camera makes the 3rd digital camera that I have personally owned and is actually a supplemental camera that I am adding to my collection.  My first camera was a Ricoh RDC-5300 from 1999, it was my faithful sidekick until I dropped it and damaged the lens.  It set a very high bar for me after that.  I replaced it 1 1/2 years ago with a much higher end camera, my Minolta DiMage 7i.  My Minolta has all the bells and whistles on it and is for the most part a digital SLR and I paid a pretty penny for that.  I however discovered that there was a penalty for buying a nice camera... I never wanted to take it anywhere casual.  The size of it (it's a full sized slr) and the weight made it bulky for carrying around on a vacation/trip and the price of it hindered me wanting to take it anywhere that might put it at risk of being grabbed.  So that is where the Nikon came in.  I realized I had a strong need for a more \"casual\" camera, one I could easily tote around and get great pics from and not worry about it being stolen (like on my upcoming cruise in December).<br /><br />I started researching all of the current 3-5mp cameras and was trying very hard to stay around $200 in price.  I quickly became discouraged as I looked at pictures on Steves-Digcams and saw that the current models were taking lesser quality pictures than my old Ricoh that only was 2.3mp!  Most of the cameras I looked at took grainy pictures with lots of noise or color distortion.  I knew I would not be happy with a lower end camera if the images were not good enough for a high quality prints or being edited.  Then I discovered the Nikon Coolpix line.  This camera takes much higher quality pictures than even my friends 5mp camera!  I must say that I am extremely satisfied with my decision.<br /><br />About the features:<br /><br />Where do I begin?  It may not have f-stops and apertures and fancy ISO settings... but this camera does amazing tricks for the little amount of cash I spent on it.<br /><br />**Auto Mode - I've tested this in many lighting conditions (bright light, room lighting, and low lighting) and each time I was impressed.  Pictures of grass blades come out clear and sharp with well defined color.  Animal fur is well defined not softened or blurred.  Pictures of shadows come out solid with no jaggies or purple distortion.  Bright sun did not fade out my pale face self standing next to a white fence.<br />**White balance - The ability for it to measure the exposure in a room is impressive as well, you can go into the settings and easily let it measure the colors in the room to get optimal contrast.<br />**Macro Mode (extreme closeups) - The camera had no pixelation or color distortion when I took pictures.  The blades of grass in a pond and each pine needle of a tree were very colorful and well defined.  The general response I got from people that I showed them too was \"wow\" and \"that little camera really took those?\"<br />**Scene Modes - I have played with only a few of them so I will just name the features I have played with.<br />**Indoor party mode - great for taking indoor pictures with lighting effects (like candles on your childs birthday cake).<br />**Panoramic mode is so simple to use and once you combine it with the Arc software that comes with the camera I think you'll be amazed.  You start by taking one picture, then on the LCD you'll see an outline of the last 3rd of the picture you took on the side of the screen... line it up with the next shot and repeat as many times as needed.  The software they supply effortlessly seams the pictures together for you making beautiful panoramic pictures.<br />**Scene guides - The guides available in portrait modes and landscape modes are wonderful for the amateur and take the worries out of focusing on the subject properly.<br />**Continuous Shot - Very handy and took about 1 photo a second for me.<br />**Auto-Focus - The camera actually projects a red light on where it is going to auto-focus so you know in advance if you are going to get the shot you want.  For those that want to use the half click focus and then move the camera this can come in very handy.<br /><br />Summary:<br />At first I was a little put off by the size (I'm used to holding a nice slr size camera) but quickly became accustomed to it.  I suffer from hand shaking on a regular basis and the first day I tested it was having problems with it... the camera didn't even seem to notice most of the time.  The pictures snapped so quick that my movement didn't even affect it.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone that is picky about the pictures they take of their loved ones and their vacation shots.  This is so much camera for the money that you can't possibly go wrong.","I previously owned a Kodak DC215, then went to a 3+ megapixel Samsung Digimax 350SE.  The Samsung is a point and shoot, large camera. I decided that I wanted to have a camera that was small enough and didn't weigh a ton to carry in my purse.  So enter the internet.  I researched cameras until I thought I'd go bonkers but kept coming back to the Nikon Coolpix 3200. I purchased a $10.00 SD memory card from Wal-Mart and I was in business.  I'm sure glad I did.  It now resides in my purse and doesn't weigh it down.<br /><br />The pictures are great. If I took a picture in a low light situation with the Samsung I got a warning of low luminence and no shot could be taken. Not the Nikon.  I took a photo of a friend in a very low light situation. The photo came out great. I also took a photo of my ceiling fan in motion and of my husband in his favorite chair (yeah a recliner). The recliner has subtle color changes. Even with the naked eye you have to be sort of close to discern this. Samsung photos showed the chair as being maroon.  The Nikon showed every little color change. The friend in the low light, well her photo came out bright and colors true. No off tints to the flesh tones, no washed out reds, I was amazed.<br /><br />I take my memory card to a Kodak kiosk and print them out there. No editing, cropping, etc. Just a print as taken. They come out perfect every time.<br /><br />This camera has so many great features that I can't wait to try them all, cropping within the camera, sunsets, even night scenes and more.  I will continue to take my Samsung in my suitcase when we travel, but know I'll probably only use the Nikon because reaching in my purse is so much easier than fishing around in a suitcase.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera to anyone who really enjoys taking snapshots, having versatility in a camera and not having to use special batteries or memory cards.  To me it's a KEEPER.","I spent about 3 days comparing cameras, and I finally settled on the Coolpix 3200. I am very pleased with this compact 3MP camera. There are many features that are useful. This camera takes very good pictures, and I'd reccomend it to anyone. The only thing you'll need is a set of rechargable batteries, and you're good. I've had my batteries in for about a week now, and taken over 100 pictures. (If you're curious, I use Energizer NiMH rechargables). You'll also need a memory card. I use a 64MB card, and that holds around 100 pictures with the highest resolution set.<br /><br />The only little thing I am unhappy about is the time it takes to recharge the flash after every picture taken with it. All in all, this camera gets 5 starts.","What do you use your digital camera for?  I use it for posting pictures to the internet for family to see, emailing pictures, and the occassional printout of a 4x6 for a scrap book page.<br /><br />This camera does all of those things very, very well.<br /><br />2 megapixels is more enough for any purpose you have around the house, such as emailing or posting pictures online, creating and printing 3x5 images, even decent-quality 8x10 prints.<br /><br />But 2-megapixel cameras are often short on quality and features, obviously because camera makers want you to buy a more expensive camera. 3 megapixels seems to be a good industry zone for picture quality vs hardware quality and price quality.<br /><br />And you want to know what megapixel really means? Well, 1600x1200 is 1.92 million pixels, or megapixels. The resolution of most pictures I post on the internet is 640x480, which is 0.3 megapixels, which is well within the reach of cell phone cameras or the $20 pocket/keychain cameras you see in the mall.  But it's quality that you get when you pay more for a camera like this.<br /><br />At 3.2mp capacity, the finest-grain image you can store is theoretically 2038 x 1568. If I vertically stacked my two work monitors (max 1800x1440 each, but I use 1600x1200) and rotated one of these images 90 degrees, then I could view it! Might get neck strain, though.<br /><br />For images at acceptible PRINTING quality you need to have about 300 real pixels for every inch of your print's dimensions.  Multiply the inch dimensions by these DPI figures to get the total resolution (horizontal and vertical, typically thousands in each dimension) you need for a decent image, and multiply these together to get a total number of pixels (megapixels.) So, you be the judge. When the wife needs a picture for her scrapbook that is 3\"x5\", then all I need if I use the formula above I found is 3x300 x 5x300 or 1.35 megapixels. For a 4\"x6\" i'd need 2.16 megapixels.  That's all!  This Nikon 3200's 3.2 megapixels is great for these kind of uses and the features is what you end up paying for.<br /><br />Even 8\"x10\" blowups on nice paper with a good printer look good enough at 3.2 megapixels.<br /><br />My Nikon 3200 fits in my pant pocket with the same footprint as my Nokia and without the battery inside weighs ounces only. It's very compact and light. Even with the battery it feels toyish but solid.  Despite its size it is remarkably easy to hold still and manipulate.  I have fairly large hands.<br /><br />One feature inparticular I wanted was Continious or Burst shooting mode. This is where the camera will take 2-3 pictures every 2-3 seconds while holding down the shutter. A must for sports photography. The real sports sideline photographers have cameras that will take pictures like a minigun. This mode also applies to normal folks like you and me when you're taking any sort of picture where the subject is, well, moving. My Nikon 3200 takes 1.5 pictures every 2 seconds, I think, which is decent.<br /><br />When you read a casual customer review, you'll often here people say that indoor pictures are bad. This is totally bunk. A well-lit room for humans is actually poorly lit for a camera and seriously impairs the autofocus's ability to find the target. That's why there's a flash. After reading a lot of reviews of digital cameras here on Amazon.com, I find that most people who complain about picture quality (which is 99% the user's fault in the first place) either don't know how to use the two-stage button (\"have to press really hard and then there's a 1-2 second delay before the picture is taken!\") or refuse/fail/don't have the camera set to use a flash inside. My Nikon has a special setting for indoor pictures with flashes, among other 'scene' modes.  The scene modes are awesome, I've taken very fast sports-like photography and then with the turn of a button taken 4-second exposures of a fireworks show minutes later.<br /><br />As for the durability of this camera, it is a bit toyish, but it seems solid enough.  The lens retracts fully into the camera body so no potential catastrophic angles there.  I have a 256mb SD card that came in a bundle with the camera that is totally overkill.  I bought a CR-V3 battery that has lasted me ~200 pictures, most without flash.  But since it was a non-rechargable battery that cost $18, I bought a rechargable AA battery kit.<br /><br />Absolutely zero complaints about this camera so far.  I trust Nikon implicitly too.","The camera has great features, like video and copying---features you don't find in a digital SLR. The camera uses AA batteries which is a plus if you travel abroad as they are readily available anywhere in the world. Two American-made AA batteries last about 60 photos with the back LCD panel turned off. Most non-name-brand batteries made in third-world countries don't work at all as digital camera is a high-drain device. The images are very sharp (sharpness is pretty close to my Nikon D70 set to Sharp).<br /><br /> The only problem I've found is the green lawn tends to look yellowish while the same scene taken by my Nikon D70 renders exactly the green color.","I bought this camera on the recommendation of a friend -- truth is, there are sooo many digital cameras out there that I just didn't know where to start.  The images from my friend's camera were remarkably vivid, so I decided to give the Nikon Coolpix 3200 3.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom a try!  I'm glad that I did!<br /><br />As an amateur photographer and an avid scrapbooker, I was looking for two things--excellent prints and compact size.  I get both with this camera.<br /><br />After opening the box, I was completely ready to take pictures in less than 5 minutes, thanks to the quick reference guide included.  After capturing more than 300 photos, I uploaded them all to my computer and sent them away to Photoworks.com.  My pictures arrived in the mail within a couple of days, and they were outstanding.  Unlike the 2.0 megapixal prints I had seen in the past, these were sharp and clear and matched the images I was seeing on the camera's monitor.  No one would be able to tell that these were taken from a digital camera instead of a film camera.<br /><br />I love the scene settings that are pre-programmed into the camera, especially the panoramic, macro, and dusk/dawn settings. The menu is set up intelligently, which means that I haven't had to refer to my owner's manual once since purchasing it almost 2 months ago.  And though I don't use it often, the movie feature is outstanding.  I can take a five minute movie complete with sound to send to family and friends via e-mail.<br /><br />I highly recommend purchasing additional batteries when you buy this, since the ones that come with it won't last very long, especially if you decide to take a movie or two.  In fact, I've started using rechargable batteries.  You'll also need a media card--I bought a 256MB, though I think that a 128MB would give you about 150 pictures (before having to download them to your computer and clear them off of the card).<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like about this camera is the clicking noises that it makes sometimes when I use some features that affect focusing such as macro.  Aside from that, I highly recommend this compact camera!  I've enjoyed it a great deal and even recently discovered that my pictures are equal to the quality of my friend's 5 megapixal camera, since going about 3.2 megapixals does almost nothing in terms of affecting the image of a 4x6, 5x7, or 8x10 print.","This is a great camera with a small size, good photo quality, cool features, and it's pretty intuitive to use. I was taking pictures straight away and the photos transferred to my iBook in a snap. My only complaint is the battery life. The batteries the camera came with lasted about 1 day and I wasn't even playing with it that much. Luckily, I had bought a battery pack and charger, but now I think I'll buy another battery pack so I can always have a spare set of charged batteries. Other than the batteries, this is a great camera and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.<br />I'm an amateur photographer but I do have my creative side, and I've been impressed with the photo quality.","I bought this camera over a year ago before they changed the body style, initially I got it for school, etc. since I'm a journalism major and had never owned a \"nice\" camera. I love my Nikon Coolpix, it's the perfect size, lightweight and small yet you are able to hold it steady to take excellent shots, even in the dark. I recently went to Disneyworld and my little Nikon was around my neck the whole time. It even took good shots of the fireworks displays. I have the Nikon NiMh rechargable batteries( a good investment for $30) and a ScanDisk 128 MB Compact flash memory card, as of right now there are well over 500 pics on my memory card, most on a normal setting. Invest in this cam, it's reasonable priced and has superb quality.","After a great survey, i bought this camera. this is nice one but it consumes battery vey much. Picture quality is execallent and you can not compare it with anyone else. I think it is better than sony cameras. This is compact and light weight. If you are looking for a nice camera in reasonable price then this is best option.","I believe I know what happened on the other review where they said the batteries ran out fast. The batteries that come with the camera are the cheap ones, they lasted all of 4 hours while I got to know the menu system of my new Nikon. This actually made me quite concerned. However, I'd purchased the Nikon NiMH Rechargeable Batteries for CoolPix 3200 with my camera so I charged those up and loaded them. Then went to FL for a vacation. They lasted 3 days shooting 130+ pics (Normal setting), then 2 days taking pics driving home, then a few more days once home. I about fell over. Seems like standard AA's in the top 2 brands of batteries last about as long as well. I don't fully know however since these things (the Nikon NiMH Rechargeable) take forever to run out of juice, and once drained only take 2 to 3 hours to recharge and are ready to go for another 5+ days of shooting, for me anyway. As for the camera the micro pics are just unreal. Everyone I show these incredibly close up images to has the same look, the open mouth dumbfounded look.  Normal images took a while to get right in various situations since you really need to choose the correct mode for the pic your taking.  This camera is not for long range shots, obviously. If you wanted that you'd be looking at something with a larger lens.  All around excellent camera !<br />The negatives I have are; On really small image subjects, such as something 1/2 an inch or less, the focal plane isn't very deep, so the front of the object may be blurry and the back is clear.  Also on small objects like this the camera wants to focus on the background and has trouble seeing the subject of your picture at times (15% of the time).  And usually its only on the super small objects that have similar color to the background (4 - 6 millimeters). However, when you get the 3200 to focus on these things the results are extraordinary.  Many people are probably mocking me for having such small subjects and passing this off as irrelevant, however, try it. Take a 3200 and take a pic of a fly, or a flower that is 5 millimeters across. When you look at your image and see every hair on the fly, and pollen grains on the flower, and hairs on the stems, you'll be totally blown away.  This camera is extraordinary, I'm thrilled I bought it.<br />Side notes:<br />I put a Panasonic 128 MB Secure Digital Memory Card in my 3200. For the Normal size pics, I can take 156 of them.<br />The camera comes with DVD that walks you through everything for setup.<br />The video you can shoot with the 3200 looks like the mildly jumpy 8mm old movies, but it's in color and I think it's fantastic, I mean, a movie with something that fits in the palm of your hand ?!?!?  It's a blast !<br />When they say the screen is hard to see in direct sun they're right, then if you have polarized sunglasses as I do... yer really in trouble :)<br />The \"weird background noise\" in the movies is the Auto Focus clicking as it maintains the focus on the subject. I agree they need to fix this.<br />Great all around camera.","Great product for the price.  I read about all the battery problems people were having with similar nikon models like this and couldn't believe it.  Mine work's great, we've taken hundreds of pictures in every type on environment and all have been great.  The shutterspeed is a little slow but with a little adjusting can easily be sped up.  The internal memory works wonderful and with the memory card you could take pictures for years without having to load them into a computer.  The pictures come out great on paper as well, we've transferred all of our into 5*7's and they all look great.","This Nikon Coolpix is the greatest thing I have ever seen. 3.2 MP is really all you need these days. It's small, light, and not ugly or anything.<br />It takes the greatest photos I've ever seen, even though I haven't printed any out yet, just by looking at them they look 200% better than my old Kodak 2 MP.<br />The movie mode is great, even though there is some kind of weird background noise from the movies, they are still good, and don't expect this to be some dv camcorder or something.<br />The scene and scene assist modes are great, although the scene modes sometimes underexaggerate or overexaggerate colors, saturation, etc.<br />There is one problem however, which everyone seems to be complaining about, which is noise in nighttime pictures. It is visible sometimes, I think this can be fixed, however, with a different scene mode, and you can always try to fix it through photoshop, etc.<br />Battery life is decent...not the best, but seems better than 3100/2100.<br />Overall, I rate it 4 stars, only because of the noise and maybe even because of the battery life. But the true point of a digital camera is its pictures, and it does a great job of doing that.","I've had my coolpix 3200 for about a week, and am really surprised at how good the pictures are, how easy it is to get the pictures into my PC, and how long the batteries last. I bought Duracell rechargeables with the camera, told my camera that these were the batteries I was using through its menu system, and have been taking pictures for a week on the same batteries. That's more than 80 pictures -- perhaps more -- all on the same 2 batteries, most of them using a flash. My battery charge meter has not even shown up yet.<br />When I first read the manual, I didn't understand the value of all the frame, portrait, and scene assist modes. As I've used the camera, though, I've come to see that they are very important. The frame and portrait assistants actually change the location of the auto-focus. When I am in sports mode, the camera's auto-focus is constantly changing so that the picture will shoot quickly when the shutter release is pressed. Shutter speed and aperature are adjusted depending on which scene I've selected. In other words, using the modes makes for much better pictures. They are more than just marketing pitches.<br />The software that came with the camera is okay, though it is nothing earth shaking. Better tools came with my scanner/copier/printer combo, but if you don't have those tools, what comes with the camera is much better than nothing and will get the job done.<br />I'm very satisfied. The camera is so small that I wear it in a tiny case on my belt all the time.<br />BTW, I was going to buy the 2200 instead, but am glad that I didn't. Once I had the manual (which is the same for both cameras), I saw that there are a number of small features that the 3200 has that are not available to the 2200. For example, the 3200 has sound for movies, the 2200 does not. You can record voice memos and set sounds for camera functions with the 3200. The 3200 can take more continuous pictures at a time (due to the higher resolution and space required). There are more differences, and most of them are small, but by the time you add them all up, it's worth the additional $100, in my oppinion.<br />I was an avid amateur photographer back \"in the day\", but grew tired of the hassles of large cameras and film developing. Thanks to this tiny, filmless camera, I'm a photographer again.","After researching digital cameras for a month I finally decided on the Nikon CoolPix 3200. I'm astounded by its great picture quality and battery life. When I received my camera I was using it for two hours (taking pictures, fiddling with the settings, etc.) and the batteries held up. Two weeks later after some use, the batteries are still great! The picture quality is amazing for a digital camera! The image is sharp and the color is balanced.<br />Another great aspect of the camera is the ability to zoom in and out after the picture has taken. It's not grainy at all, in fact it was so good I was able to see the tiny writing on a poster almost 30 feet away after zooming up close!<br />The recycle time is good, under a second and the features are easy to use even if you don't read the manual.<br />If you're a novice at digital photography or even a professional this camera is for you!","I will not reiterate what many have already said. In short, if you are looking for the single best digital camera on the market - for the price you will not be able to find a better one then the Nikon Coolpix 3200. It does everything that anyone could ask that a digital camera at this price point can do. Combine this with the Nikon Net website at [...] and you can shoot, download and post your pictures on your very own website, all for free and all with Nikon. By all means buy this camera and get started taking great pictures as soon as you put the batteries in. It really is that easy.","Nikon has always had a reputation for superior photo products, but I never bought one because there was always a near-as-good Pentax or Canon. This time, they've hit a home-run. The Coolpix 3200 is as good or better, according to industry reviews, as other manufacturers' and the price, for a change, is right. Not only that, but once you load the software, you can set the camera up to automatically load the pictures. The camera comes with several editing software programs as well, and they work nicely. You don't have to go out and buy Photoshop.<br />Remember, this is a point-and-shoot. It is not meant for people that have to have all kinds of control over how the picture comes out. If you are a pro, stick to SLRs, either digital (which cost in general, more than $1000) or film, which are still far more than this camera.<br />A strong suggestion: Buy an RCR-V3 rechargeable battery. These are Lithium-ion rechargeables. You can get a Delkin one for under $30 including battery and charger. It will take many more picture than the NiMH.","Up till now I've been a big fan of Canon digital cameras (esp. the PowerShot S410 and S500), but also have liked Minolta and Pentax offerings.  Last night I went to a wedding and the gentleman sitting next to me had the Nikon Coolpix 3200, and I was astonished to discover how excellent its battery life was.  The gentleman took over 300 shots, all with flash on and all with LCD on as viewfinder, and he also played back the pictures to lots of guests, and at the end, when we were among the last to leave, the batteries in the camera were still going strong!  I was totally impressed.  I had my Minolta Dimage F300 (5MP camera) with me and the batteries ran out after about 80 shots -- and my NiMH was rated higher than his (2100mAh vs. his 1950, I believe).  I walked away totally sold on the Nikon.<br />OK, I exaggerated.  If the image quality weren't good, perpetual battery life wouldn't have meant much.  But judging from zoomed-in playback on the Nikon's LCD, as well as his comments, the image quality seemed excellent.  Compared to my Minolta Dimage F300, the 3200's images were generally sharper, while the color temperature was not as pleasing as my Minolta's, but still excellent.  He took a wide range of shots, from outdoors to indoors to close-ups to wide-angle... and most came out quite satisfying from a technical point of view.  All were well-exposed, sharp, and evenly lit in cases where flash was used.<br />In addition, I noticed that when I borrowed his 3200 to shoot a few pictures after my Minolta's batteries died, the recycle time on the 3200 was quite fast, unlike my Minolta, which could take 6 or 7 seconds before I could shoot the next shot.  The 3200 was ready in under a second.  The only problem I experienced was there seemed to be a shutter delay with the 3200: after I pressed the shutter, it waited a second or slightly longer before taking the picture.  You may want to keep this in mind when shopping for this camear.  The delay didn't affect the pictures, but did feel weird since my Minolta has virtually no shutter delay.<br />The camera seemed well built.  But it was the battery life that was truly impressive -- and the fact it delivered such good battery performance on 2 AA NiMH batteries!","I needed a digital camera, primarily to capture the construction of our new house.  So I spent a couple of months researching options before choosing the new Nikon Coolpix 3200.  I am very happy with my choice.<br /><br />I have a Nikon N4004S SLR 35-mm camera, which I am very happy with, but I wasn't about to take hundreds of pictures of our house with it and spend the money on prints and converting all the pictures to JPEG images to put on a personal web site.  After reading reviews of various digital cameras online, as well as in Consumer Reports and Smart Homeowner, I decided I wanted a 3 Megapixels camera with 3x optical zoom, a Secure Digital card slot, a nice color LCD monitor, date imprinting, audio memo capability, movie mode, good flash range, USB port downloading, excellent optics and color representation, and decent AA battery life.  The Nikon Coolpix 3200 had everything I was looking for and more.  At first I was leaning toward Panasonic, Canon, and Kodak models, but the Nikon won out because of my past experience with Nikon and it seemed to be superior in the features that were most important to me (plus some reviews of the competing models I was considering scared me a bit).<br /><br />Despite what some reviewers have said about this camera, I think it does very well on battery life.  I am using the Nikon EN-MH-1 NiMH rechargeable batteries (I also have the MH-70 charger) and, so far, I am happy with the battery life.  The pictures are absolutely outstanding - the color representation and optics are first class, and the images look great even blown up to maximum on my 15\" LCD computer monitor.  I haven't used all the shooting modes yet (mostly auto mode), but I was pleased to see the improvement in brightness and color of pictures I took during dusk in night mode.  The date imprinting is very handy for taking pictures of the house construction progress and it has been great to be able to take the camera to my Mother-in-law to show her the house pictures on her television using the audio and video cable supplied with the 3200.  The camera is also so compact that it is easy to take pictures with one hand, if necessary, and the zoom is very smooth.  The Nikon View software is a nice bonus.  The only drawbacks I've seen are that the LCD monitor is difficult to see in bright sunlight (not a problem though because I think the view finder is easy to use) and pictures in low light can be dim, grainy, and blurry, especially if you're not in the right mode (dusk or night) and the camera is not stable while taking the picture (a tripod is recommended for night shooting).<br /><br />All in all, a great camera at a very good price!  I recommend it highly.  I also recommend the Panasonic 10 Mb/s 256MB Secure Digital card, which Nikon had tested for this camera.<br /><br />(Note: Since my wife had already registered to post reviews here, I'm writing this under her screen name.)","I'm a novice at digital camera photography, and just got the Coolpix 3200 three days ago.  I'm loving it!  The pictures I take are sharper than expected, and the camera is very easy to use.  The uploading to the computer is a snap, and the editing software included with the package (I bought) makes for easy use.<br />The camera is small, and fits nicely into a shirt pocket, so I carry it every where I go - including a recent fishing trip with one of my sons.  I shopped for a long time before deciding on one of the many digital cameras available, and took the Coolpix.  I have not been disappointed.<br />I used it nearly all day yesterday at a grandson's birthday party, taking lots of picture, and the batteries still have power.  We even reviewed the pictures on the TV, which is a great feature.  I have a recharger, but so far, battery life has been long.","I love this camera! The picture it takes are wonderful quality, very clear and the color is great. My only complaint, which i guess is a big one is the battery life. After having the camera for one day, playing around with it and getting familiar, the battery light already went on. We bought rechargeable batteries and a charger, which makes it better, but I would have preferred a camera that could be charged directly.<br />Aside from this though, the camera is great and works great on the fly."]}]
