[{"name":"Toshiba PDR-M25","amazon_reviews":["My Toshiba PDR-M25 is little over seven years old and it is like brand new.  Looks good, but above all, is still in perfect working condition.

So far, the pics that I've taken with this Toshiba, are great pics.

I've certainly gotten my money's worth out of it many times over. As an earlier reviewer put it, the M25 does very well what it was designed to do. The bad news is that a week ago my little pal started asking me whether I wanted to format the media card which it had never done before and which I hadn't removed even once since I installed it 3 yrs ago. When I click \"yes\" it says \"card error\".

You can also switch a few other things around. I don't know what they are exactly, but they have worked for me in solving the low res problem. Anyway, the battery problem also has a solution. NIMH rechargable batteries have lasted me all day and then some for several filled cards. I use 64 mb cards. I have 2500 mah NIMH batteries.

It has cool 3x optical zoom. It eats batteries up like candy, but I bought rechargeable, longer lasting ones so its not such a problem. Its lens cap doesn't stay on.<br />The low down: if you want a camera the takes beautiful pictures, spend... more on a fancy newer model with 3.2 or higher resolution.<br />If you want a camera that is cost effective and records memories and does all the same stuff as any other digital camera (it even has some special settings which I haven't investigated much, like shutter speed) in only very slightly imperfect 2D form, buy this one used and be careful with the lense and flash cover (though it's absence doesn't seem to affect performance).","This camera was a present from my wife. I've had it about a month, and it works well for me. I've been using a SLR film camera with a zoom lens, which is in a higher quality/price bracket, but I'm not even an advance amateur photographer.<br />  I'm quite happy with this camera. To echo other reviews, yes it can eat batteries. I did however just shoot over 120 pictures on a partially used set of batteries, but I usually keep the LCD off - yes you can turn it off - and turned the flash off for the last 20 shots or so. (I find the flash often fires even outside if left on automatic.) I don't know if that is really out of line with other similar cameras.<br />  Also, low light can be a problem, along with shooting into light. I do have a lot of low light photos that came out great though. You have to be careful that you are not shooting towards a lamp or window (even in a corner of the frame) which throws everything off.<br />  My only other complaint is that the top dial, which selects manual, automatic, and playback modes, is easily moved just by putting it in its case.<br />  Overall, it takes great pics for it resolution and cost. I got a 128MB card with it (and a card reader) that gives 131 pics at the highest resolution (and something around 2000 at the lowest resolution and pic size). You will want a larger memory card because part of the advantage of digital cameras is you can take a ton of shots and the ones you throw away don't cost you anything. (And if you save to CD-R, the ones you save cost a fraction of a cent a piece - of course unless you print them.)<br />  I did not use the encluded software as I use a Mac with the free iPhoto and own Photoshop for anything more serious.<br />  A friend who owns this camera recommended it to my wife for me, and I would recommend it to others. Sure I'd love a digital SLR, but would not love spending the bucks. I do take lots more pics now that I have this camera.","I was just able to take 30 pictures before running out 8 Alkaline batteries. Unbelievable! This is the only thing I need<br />to complain.","This is a decent starter camera for the price-- the software is useful, and the pictures are crisp. However, this camera is relatively large and eats batteries (4 at a time), even with minimal LCD use. The lens cap keeps falling off and is not as convenient as a slide cover (like the Olympus Camedia D520, which I now use). I would recommend another camera like the Olympus or the Canon Digital Elph for the more active point-and-shoot person.","Having never used a digital camera previously, I have to say using this camera has been nothing but easy and fun.  The photos can be effortlessly transferred to your PC via usb port to JPEG format. The enclosed IMAGE EXPERT software is also very user friendly. While the camera's auto-focus does have some difficulty getting the shot in low (artificial) light settings, the overall results are quite good.  For example the outdoor daylight shots without the use of flash are amazing. Also the 3x optical zoom lets you  get up to three inches away from your subject for crisp, clear controlled exposures.  (This is ideal for internet auctions). The flash gives you the option for red-eye reduction as well.  Another really fun feature is having the ability to view your pics via sideshow on your TV set. (This can be used to video tape the pictures onto a VHS tape to mail to friends/ family members who do not have a computer).  I strongly suggest picking up the Toshiba PDR-ACM1A AC Adapter (sold separately through Toshiba).  This way you needn't worry about drained batteries when transferring images to PC, or while taking photos when at home.)  Otherwise, you could just keep a stockpile of alkalines on hand, or pick up a rechargable set of batteries.  A great first-time (Macintosh compatible) digital camera!","Having never used a digital camera previously, I have to say using this camera has been nothing but easy and fun.

He's had it for more than a month now, and LOVES it.  The printed copies are as good as can be expected for a 2MP cam.  Perfect for the person who uses their photos for small presentations and emails. This is a great camera for the price.","I have owned this camera for about 3 months and I am very happy with it.  It takes great shots and is easy to operate.  The menu is easy to work through and covers everything. Using the max resolution, I have been able to print a 8x10 photo with good results.  The only problem I have found is taking pictures in a low light situation.  The camera has a difficult time focusing in the auto-focus mode.  Overall for the price [$$$] at the local store I am very pleased.","I bought PDR-M25 and have been using it for the last 4 months.  I am very happy that I made this purchase and it's really proved it's worth.  It's got no fancy features and so very decently priced.  I wouldn't be using most of the features that are provided with the higher priced cameras anyways.  A truly worthy deal...","This is my first digital camera.Toshiba did not dissapoint. Simple to operate, I got started immediately. Software is great and user friendly. I recommend upgrading the digital card to 128MB so you don't have to worry about taking the best quality photos and running out of disk space.","Very updated technology, quite small, clear picture, and best of all fun to use.  This is my 2nd digital camera, my first one was very difficult to use and it cost $2000.00 + (way back in 1999). Highly recommend it!!!","Very updated technology, quite small, clear picture, and best of all fun to use.  This is my 2nd digital camera, my first one was very difficult to use ... Highly recommend it!!!","I love this camera.  I bought it at Costco to get my wife off my back about not have a digital camera.  The megapixel count could be greater, but the price was right.  Then we took it home and started using it - I was shocked... The quality is great, the screens are easy to understand, the options are many-fold, and the connectability couldn't be better.  It came with a USB cable for the computer (easy plug-and-play for my Windows XP) and a video cable that plugs directly into any TV/VCR input.  I love it!!","I got this camera as a gift, and researched it online to see if it was worth keeping. I looked here at amazon.com, and also at [another web site]. After reading the reviews, I had mixed feelings, but at [dollar amount] it's not a bad little camera. I bought rechargeable Nickle-Metal-Hydride(NiMH) batteries to try and quench this camrea's power appetite, but was still defeated. On the highest mega-pixle setting(2.2mp), I can take about 10 pictures or so before the batteries run out. I can only get about 7 pictures on the included 8meg scan disk, so you constantly have to download your pictures to your computer. A quick solution to this is to purchase a larger scan disk card. I had also taken a few pictures, 60 or so, on the 1.1 mega-pixle setting, and had only used 1 out of 3 battery marks. This required a great deal of downloading, but it is very quick to download. This camera overall is pretty good for the price, and since I'm not looking for something to take professional pictures with, it is great for me. If you purchase this camera, I do suggest your purchase rechargeable NiMH batteries(I think I will purchase another set of 4), a charger to charge the batteries(make sure it is NiMH compatable), and a larger scan disk card.","I spent a lot of time looking at reviews and comparing models before I bought this camera back in March. The picture quality is almost unparalleled in it's price range.  It is fairly easy to learn,and it comes with a quality no frills photo editing software (Image Expert). Toshiba provides excellent customer support. I used it extensively for a Windows related problem (I ultimately found out the problem was with my computer not the camera/software).<br />I strongly recommend getting NI-MH rechargeable batteries, alkaline batteries only last a few hours. An 8MB Smart Media card is ok to start with, but will only hold 7 high quality images.<br />The only drawback I have found after 3 months of almost daily use, is the design of the camera. It is boxy and somewhat difficult to maneuver. It took me longer to get used to it than any other camera I have owned.<br />Overall this camera is an excellent buy, and makes a good first time digital camera."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S30","amazon_reviews":["This camera has been in my arsenal for over a decade.

OK for auto shooting but useless for creative photography,<br /><br />Auto focus and close-up focus did not work 100% of the time. Continuous focus was hit & miss.<br /><br />Battery life inadequate - 20 mins to 1/2 hr at best<br /><br />Camera was returned to Canon during Warranty but none of the above issues were resolved.<br /><br />Sold the camera after 18 months of serious useage","I've shot hundred of pictures in the rain, at the beach and have never had any issue other than the sometimes slow first shot issue, mentioned else where.<br /><br />It has been drop off the kitchen counter and lived on with a small dent.<br /><br />I'd gladly buy a newer model if I needed to, but 3.2 megs I have found to be more than good enough for family shots.  In comparing this to my other camera from a computer vendor I'd have to say stick to camera vendors models, they feel and work like cameras, right down to the little mirror/shutter sound that lets other people taking your vacation pictures know that they have in fact taken a picture.<br /><br />I do think the lcd too small at times to determine some options, like the flash mode (red eye).  Perhaps newer SLR digitals will get in viewer features, for when you saving power by not running the lcd display.","I bought this camera about a year ago and am still discovering new features. This camera has so many features that I'm sure I'll never learn all of them (I only use the \"auto\" and \"movie\" settings and can't figure out what the rest of them are for).<br /><br /> The good news is that it's incredibly easy to use, even for someone as camera un-savvy as me (and this surprises me because I love electronics). The auto focus works wonders. The 3mega pixels are more than enough to deliver clear and crisp photos from a printer. Photo transferring is a breeze with iPhoto (for Macs) and Picasa (it's free for Windows).<br /><br /> I also want to point out that it is incredibly durable. This camera lives in my purse (along with an oversized wallet, cell phone, keys, iPod and accessories... The list goes on, but the camera has no scratches and after a year I've had zero problems.<br /><br /> No plans to upgrade because all my needs are satisfied with this product... And I've got years of product discovery ahead of me, starting with the functions of the other 11 settings on the formatting wheel.","I have owned this camera for over a year now and taken probably 3000+ pics. I have learnt a lot in this one year about digital cameras in general and this camera in particular. The picture quality is simply superb in most conditions. The one problem of dull pics indoors that the previous reviewer mentioned is definitely something I noticed too. One thing worth trying is to not use the flash and instead use more light indoors if possible. The problem occurs because the flash range is small and it will illuminate only nearby objects. All in all, a fantastic product. I would buy it again if I had to.","I've owned a Canon Powershot S30 since may 2002 and am happy with my purchase.<br />Cons:<br />- Joystick used to navigate menu items makes it very difficult to \"click\"/select items especially if in a hurry. Gets worse with age.<br />- Sliding door is on/off switch, means camera is often accidentally switched off when framing shot as fingers press on loose door/off switch. Gets worse with age.<br />- Dust gets on lens easily, under sliding door.<br />- Supplied memory card (16mb) inadequate,  recommend 256mb+.<br />- LCD viewfinder difficult to see in direct sunlight, makes it very difficult to use manual features where small numbers/icons need to be read.<br />- Often a long delay on shutter action, means you miss the framed shot.<br />- Battery life only about 100 shots, seems to get worse with age. Need two batteries.<br />- Bulky & heavy body, compared to many other compact digital cameras.<br />- No protective case supplied with camera.<br />- Software to get images from camera to computer a large-long install, I cant find a way to do it without installing all the software on the CD.<br />- Impressive number settings can be controlled manually but accessing and changing them via menus and buttons is slow compared to an SLR.<br />Pros:<br />- Good quality photos.<br />- Lots of settings can be controlled manually, compared to other compact digital cameras I've used.<br />- Very good software on the camera, especially for navigating and viewing images.<br />- Batteries charge very quickly","I've had my Canon s30 for a year and a half now, and it's still at the top of its game.  Brushed aluminum.  Weighty, but not bulky.  Crystal-clear screen.  Potentially ridiculously intricate functionality, but simple enough for anyone to use.  And yes, the video function is incredibly handy to have around.<br />The cons cited in other reviews hold, of course: the joystick is difficult to use, you'll want to buy a separate 256 MB card, the battery drains fairly quickly, that sort of thing.  Except for these aspects of its anatomy, it really is a brilliant camera.<br />But here's one pro I haven't seen anyone mention yet: you can zoom in--really CLOSE!--on a picture you've taken, and then scroll around in it.  This is an incredible function, catering to those social settings where everyone gathers around you and demands to see themselves in that last picture you took.  Really handy (and sometimes VERY entertaining).","I have owned the S30, S40, and S50 and have done everything one can do with these cameras.  Here is my take on the good and bad on the Canon PowerShot S30.<br />This was a terrific small digital camera when it was introduced, but the digital camera market advances quickly and this model has been surpassed by Canon's own S45 (which is an updated S40) and the new S50 (5 megapixel in the same body only in high-tech black). Serious photographers seekng a digital should turn to Canon's EOS Digital Rebel. The S30 and S40 are good cameras if you want lots of features in a small package without paying a lot of money.  The two models are identical except for this: the S30 is 3 megapixel and allows ISO-equivalence of 800, allowing for low-light indoor photography.  The S40 is a 4 megapixel model using a denser CCD, and its maximum ISO is 400.  You can make the pictures smaller than the maximum size to conserve space on the removable CompactFlash cards.<br />Several modes are available to you such as Sports (high shutter-speed and high resolution shots), Portrait, Night, etc. You can put it in complete Idiot Mode (okay, Automatic mode) and let it select your shutter speed and aperture, or you can pick one or the other and let the camera pick the missing one, or you can go full into Manual mode and pick both. There's even a Movie mode, complete with sound, which creates video clips of 320 x 200 pixels.<br />This small camera fits in a purse or shirt pocket easily and won't get in the way if you're shouldering it in a case (not included, just buy a generic). But you pay a price for the small size: the optical zoom is limited to 3x. And unfortuately, the S30, like all the PowerShot S family, starts out with a focal length of 11mm, which is a very wide-angle view. Even at 3X optical zoom you will max out at 55mm, often not as close as you'd need. There is a digital zoom, but so what? Crop your picture in software later rather than play with that silly feature.  I found 55mm insufficient for shooting across a large room.  If you work closer in this won't be a problem, but it is not a good focal length for shooting children, who stop whatever adorable thing they're doing when they notice you framing that shot.  (And see comment on slow shutter response, below.)<br />The sliding door that covers the lens (and turns on the camera) seems flimsy and can cause problems.  My 3YO niece got ahold of my S40 (remember, this is the exact same body as the S30) and ripped the door off. I was able to reattach it but now it's a loose tooth, ready to fall off again. Even under warranty, my choice was to send it back to Canon for 12 weeks or live with it. I couldn't live without the camera, so I kept it, loose sliding door and all. I've just learned not to lend it to people who can't baby it; a good push and that door is off the camera again.<br />One of the S30's most frustrating limitations is a slow shutter response.  I can't tell you how many shots I've missed using it; I frame it lovingly, I see the perfect moment, I shoot... but no score. The people have moved on, the sun has set, the universe suffers heat-death, and finally the shutter clicks.  If you want a fast shutter then you must have a digital SLR, as almost all the compact-style digital cameras such as this one have the delayed shutter issue. Another note of annoyance on the PowerShot S family: they come with a wrist strap but no shoulder strap.  I don't know what use a wrist strip is for a camera; if I'm not using it then I want my hands free.  I bought a generic shoulder strap but it wasn't a great fit.  At least Canon should offer one as an extra-cost accessory.<br />I give this camera 3 stars; 4 for putting so many features in such a small package, but the loss of one because you can buy the S40 for about the same price and the gain of a megapixel more than makes up for losing ISO 800 (which produces very noisy photos, anyway).  The PowerShot S30 comes with software, but you'll probably want to buy your own image editing package, such as Photoshop Elements.  The package provided is fairly limited. Useful software includes PhotoStitch, which allows you to make your own panaramic style images from a series of linked shots. The included 32 MB CompactFlash card is also too small for typical use, so plan on buying a bigger card. Also plan on buying a second battery.","I own this camera - Canon Powershot S30, for close to 7 months already. I would say I have not much complaints on this camera except it is slight heavy thus I could not carry it around without carryin my backpack as well.<br />S30 Macro shot is sufficient for normal usage (10cm closest), however, I needed more close-up shot. In this manner, I hope to trade in for Canon Ixus 400. But I have no regrets having S30 because it can be used as point-and-shoot and as manual control camera at the same time. I guess I was just getting greedy in wanting my gudget to be in its latest technology and we knew that it is quite impossible unless we buy a new one.<br />I love its paranoma mode. I did a 360 degree shot before and the outcome did not come out as what I have expected due to different lighting but the software knitting the paranoma shots is user-friendly and easy to use. I did other paranoma shots (and not 360 degree or too extreme) and the shots I must say is excellent. I did a paranoma horizontally on a beach scenary.<br />Sometimes,when I press the shoot button to take a picture, the camera did not shoot. I must try the 2nd time before the picture is taken. I also do not know why but I have press hard and deep already, I swear!<br />The battery is still ok, and one lasts me about one and the half hours with LCD on. I bought a spare battery though, just in case.<br />The software is stable since the camera was in the market for 2 years when I bought it. Thus I have no problem on the retracting lens matter. I like the metallic feel of the camera and I just hope that Canon have add-on lens for this series of camera, one day. Think this camera can last with me for the next 5 years or so.<br />No problem with this camera for me.","I recently upgraded from a 1MP Kodak camera to the S30 and I couldn't be happier.  Its a good size, takes great pictures, and has a bunch of features.<br />Pros:<br />Excellent picture quality, Functionally diverse, Compact metal case, Retracting lens with built-in lens-cover, light weight and rather small, photo-stitch, Lithium Ion battery, Uncompressed format<br />Cons<br />Included media card is small.<br />The Bottom Line<br />Its a great camera for camera enthusiasts or even jsut a point and shoot camera.","Before I bought this camera from Amazon, I made sure that I read all the raves, pros and cons and trusted the name canon for a great camera.  This camera comes with many features that I probably may not ever need, but its just great having it anyway.  For the price, you'd think they will throw in a carrying case or a 64mb compact flash memory card.  This camera does not take good pictures at night, it over compensates images thus its blur or becomes too 'fake' or 'dark'.  its only great for indoors (the red eye does not work either) and outdoors (during daytime).  its a good camera to have if you are into digital photography, but if its quality pix you are looking for, canon rebel is still the best buy out there.","The cammera is very nice. The bed things about it thou are that its pretty big and the \"joystick\" is very hard to operate. Its to samll to use it. But overall the quality of pictures is VERY GOOD. I would recommend this cammera to anyone.","I have been using this camera for 5 months now and have been very pleased with it. The controls are intuitive and easy to use-my only complaint is that sometimes the master control/cursor button at the top of the camera is difficult to control. Picture quality is excellent and there is good creative control with the exposure compensation and manual focus. The included software works well with<br />mac and windows. The photo altering program that comes with it doesn't have many features, but at least alters exposure and removes  redeye. I wish the camera used AA batteries like my father in laws Sony.-you definitely need an extra battery with this camera.","I just bought this camera used from another Amazon member and all I can say is Wow! I need it to take pictures for web and print (as a professional photographer and designer), and this camera is packed with all the features I could imagine I need, at a great price.<br />First off, the camera is a good size--small and light and streamlined. Easy to find controls and great display screen. It's easy to use -- I just charged the batteries, popped them in, and started shooting for a client. The user manual is a bit redundant, but with an image of every step of the process, is is handy. I referenced it immediately to be sure I was setting the time/date and image sizes properly.<br />Far away shots of a dim restaurant are crystal clear. Macro shots of product labels are crisp and perfectly lit. No one has red eyes (auto flash setting). Edges are crisp and colors really pop--no washing out or muddy-ing with this.<br />The only problem I've found is that the zoom/focus button is a bit hard to maneuver (right in front of shutter button), but I figure I will get used to it.<br />I bought a 256MB flash card and took large images by the hundreds--I took so many I used the battery pretty quickly (2+ hours), so I would recommend a second battery and a good-sized compact flash card to go with your purchase. I plugged the battery and charger into an outlet, ate a sandwich, and the camera was ready to go again in about 20 minutes.<br />I can't wait to try scenery pics and also some portraits (it has a portrait mode). Also want to try the video capture out.<br />For a used price of [less amount] (new is easily [alot more]), and the price of an extra memory card and battery (bought cheap from online auction), I feel I have everything I could want with a digital camera. And with newer models out, prices should continue falling.<br />After using other people's digitals for the past year (and tons of different brands), I think I picked a gem. I am totally impressed with the digital zoom and glad I opted for a 3 mega-pixel (and savings) instead of wasting big bucks on something more (which I don't need even for print images).<br />Funny thing is, everyone I know spent a fortune on their digital cameras and NEVER use them!! I ask them what kind of camera they have and what features, and they all say, \"I don't know. But I know it was expensive.\" Well, their cameras can gather dust. Mine is going with me everywhere, tucked into my purse.","This was my first digital camera and I haven't stopped taking pictures and printing them on my canon printer.  I cannot say enough about this camera.  It's easy to use and lightweight so I can take it with me wherever I go.","I ABSOLUTELY love love love love love my camera I used to own the Nikon swivel cool pix and I have to say that although the s30 is a little bit heavier and larger its way better!","I love this camera. It is very tolerant of less than ideal circustances. It takes superb pictures even when the kids move around.","I bought this camera about a 1 year ago and it is great. There may be too many features for the general picture taker, but all in all I would receommend it.","Fully automatic point and shoot for the novice in the family but with fully programmable features to satisfy even the most experienced amateur. I'll let sites like Imaging Resource (.com) and others like it comment on image quality and other technicals, which are fantastic, and I encourage you to check these out for the meat of your investigation. For this review, I've chosen to focus mostly on ergonomics, feature set and usability.<br />Pros:<br />- Small sturdy form factor: in the 3 MP category, not as small as the DimageX, but doesn't sacrifice quality so you can hang it around your neck - not that kind of camera<br />- Advanced feature set to satisfy the experienced amateur<br />- Movie mode: capture 30 seconds at a time w/ sound - not a good substitute for a camcorder, but more handy than you would think (e.g. I capture 4-5 golf swings in 30 seconds, download it to my computer and analyze in slow motion/frame advance in Win Media Player 9)<br />- Absolutely fantastic image quality (my layman's opinion)<br />Cons:<br />- On camera flash a bad light source: all 35mm/digital cameras have this problem, but what makes this a con for this camera, especially if you are an experienced photographer, is the S30 can not power an off-camera flash (through a hot sync).<br />- \"Enter/OK\" softkey switch that controls a number of menu functions is a little difficult to master.<br />- No diopter: this means that why you see through the viewfinder is not quite what you get. You must use the LCD to see exactly how it will be framed, but of course this uses battery power.<br />Other Issues:<br />- Proprietary battery: I wouldn't worry about this - the batteries charge quickly (1 hour), are getting cheaper (see this site for the NB-2L) and are Lithium Ion which should last a good while.<br />- Somewhat fragile sliding lens cover - don't handle it roughly and it will function fine<br />Also, reading the manual is a must - take the 60 minutes and just do it. A word on the other Powershot cameras - the S40, with 4 MP, and the S50 with 5 MP. The S30 is more than adequate to get a 35mm quality 8x10 print - why an amateur would want 5 MP I'm not sure, but if you are a professional, I doubt you're looking at the Powershot series so stick with the S30.<br />If You Buy It:  get (1) a bigger CF card (at least 128 MB - see my Viking review), (2) an extra battery (see my Canon NB-2L review) and (3) a CF card reader to save on battery power.<br />Bottom Line: Not quite a home run, but great mid to high end consumer 3MP - you will not be disappointed.","Do prices go down fast or what?  I brought my camera 1 year ago for 400, and now it is 300.  Now that I have owned this for 1 year, I know both pros and cons of this camera.<br />Pro: very nice pictures overall and great quality too.  The cool feature is the \"night\" mode\".  Switch to this mode, go into a dark room, and then take the picture.  Presto, the pictures comes out in color as if it was daytime.  But sometimes, if you use this mode at farther objects, the picture tends to get overexposed and you get a blurry lighted picture that looks like lighting struck.  Takes excellent everyday pictures!<br />Con: battery life is pretty short..if you plan on going on a trip, I guess buying an extra battery and bring the recharger.<br />- dark indoor pictures sometimes.  I've tried this on several occasions taking indoor pictures.  If your subject is close to you, the picture comes out excellent and great quality.  But if you were to take the picture from far away and try to zoom in at something (such as at a concerthall, or a graduation, the picture comes out dark and dull).  Anyone have suggestions to make it appear brighter?<br />-if you leave it on for a while (1/2 hour), the camera will get very warm.  I'm not sure if this is true of all digital cameras though.","It's been nearly four months since I purchased Canon S30, and I must say that my contentment with it is increasing every day!<br />The image quality is excellent. In the automatic mode, all you have to do is simply pressing the big button. Even if you're a professional, this becomes handy when you need quick and good pics. Otherwise, the manual option is excellent too. If you do not wish to use the flash, then you have to be very careful in holding the machine still; because a slight tremble can create a blur in the whole image. But these are, usage issues, that can be solved very quickly.<br />The size of the pictures varies from your computer's screen to a 8-11 page. It's good that you get big pictures, because you can resize them to any dimension you want afterwards.<br />There's a movie feature, which runs from 30s to 2 min, according to the size of it. I did not know this when I was buying it; but I must say that for the most of the time, I'm shooting movies instead. The reason is that you can record sound perfectly as well and I do mean it! It's in .mov format which can be easily played by any player. Furthermore, I've actually put together an amateur short film, by combining and editing the movies in Windows Movie Maker. It's just wonderful to have this machine.<br />The softwares included with the machine are good, but they have some flaws unfortunately. The picture organizer, called ImageReady, hassles sorting all the images when you add or remove an image, which takes a lot of time when you have hundred images.<br />It's really necessary that you purchase another battery. Having two keeps you safe in long journeys. I also recommend you to buy another memory card. The one that comes with the machine is 16 megs, which is not bad actually, but you might want to get a 256 meg one, and do not bother with loading off your images frequently. This is totally extra, but I also have a memory reader, Intelliflash, which is about 6 times faster than the computer in transfering the images. If you're dealing with many pictures or movies at a time, this might be your solution.<br />If you really want to make a combo with S30 by buying a photo printer, then I would go for Canon i850, for which I have a special review on the product's page in amazon. With the two, you will be able to shoot pictures, transfer them to computer and print them in minutes.<br />What sets a digital camera apart from a nondigital camera is that you can modify your images on computer. If you want to leave things to chance, and wait for results, nondigital is loveable. However, if you want to edit your images, crop some people out or make yourself more beautiful or handsome, digital camera is just for you! I have both of them. I carry them side by side inside my canon bag. (Yes, I'm obsessed with Canon!) According to how I feel about the atmosphere, I use them interchangeably.<br />Also, another thing about Canon S30: I was also once trying to figure out which camera to buy, looking at all zooms and digital zooms of every machine... But, you know what, it just never ends! The next day we will have 20x zooms. So, I grant you, that this machine will not disappoint you by any means. Do what your mind tells you...","Ooooooh Boy What a camera, for guys like who don't want more proffesional photography point of view this is an excellent choice. I developed my photos in Costco which is just 2.00 for an 8/12 SIZE photo, its clarity and pixels are breath taking man. Actually I got this camera in a gold box price at 340/- but that is an ultimate deal. If you get it for 350/- also its good. Any how I am enjoying with this camera which has all options except external built in flash light mode which is not a big thing but for night shots its a must for long view shots.","Canon's S30 fills a nice niche between expensive, feature-laden cameras and point-and-shoots.  Its compact size, snug enough to fit in the palm of your hand and perfect for slipping into a pocket, makes it an ideal companion for those excursions when a larger camera would be too bulky or conspicuous.  The silver all-metal body is sleek and stylish, so much that it's almost a fashion accessory.  It's loaded with features, an amazing feat for such a small package, while at the same time offers unparalleled ease of use.  Lastly, it's a great deal considering its price-feature ratio.<br />The S30 includes the usual automatic presets such as landscape and portrait, but also offers the semi-automatic and fully manual modes that a serious photographer would want.  The following adjustments may come in handy: 1) film speed from ASA-equivalent 50 to 800, 2) spot, center-weighted and evaluative metering modes, 3) three selectable autofocus areas, 4) exposure compensation between -2 and 2 EV in steps of 1/3 EV, 5) continuous drive mode (though maxing out at a modest 2.5fps), 6) macro mode.  While I still prefer an SLR in most situations, the S30 fills many of my needs very nicely.  I use the it to take preview or experimental shots or to take shots that I would hesitate to blow film on.  Morever, the S30 makes your job a cinch when it comes to panoramas.  The panoramic mode shows you a third of the previous frame, either vertical or horizontal, which is an invaluable guide to help you line up the current frame.  I used to have to spend a lot of time in Photoshop to line up adjacent frames and erase the seams between frames.  Canon's Photostitch software does all of that and more, at the click of a button!<br />Picture quality is very good, with excellent sharpness throughout the image and no noticeable softness in the corners at wide-angle.  Macro shots are very sharp, to the point that I decided to do close-ups primarily with the S30.  Colors can be a little flat, but this can be easily fixed in Photoshop.  There is a special \"Vivid\" or saturated mode, but this comes at the expense of losing other controls over the shot.  I've noticed that the dynamic range for the CCD sensor is quite low, much worse than for color negatives or slides.  This is most apparent if you've got a mixed light and dark scene; either the sky would be washed out or the foreground would be underexposed.  This could be a shortcoming of CCDs in general and not one particular to the S30.<br />The S30's 3-megapixels resolution is good enough for a 2048x1536 image, which in turn is sufficient for 8x10 enlargements.  If this is not large enough for your needs, the S40 ups the ante to 4 megapixels.  There is a USB jack for downloading images and an A/V jack for previewing images on TV.  You will want to invest in a CF card-reader however, for convenience's sake.  The storage slot takes Type I or II CF cards, and also accommodates a Microdrive.<br />The S30's compact size is its greatest asset, but is also responsible for a few shortcomings.  The 1.8\" LCD screen is bright and contrasty, but only indoors.  Lacking a swivel and anti-glare coating, it's virtually useless outdoors.  You may have to resort to the optical viewfinder, which does not cover 100 percent of the image.  The LCD displays most useful information, but inexplicably lacks a battery life indicator.  You'd have no idea how much power is left until the low-battery indicator flashes.  To make matters worse, the rechargeable Li-Ion battery has rather short lifespan, between 30-50 shots.  I have to carry 2 spare batteries in order to shoot for a whole day.  The thumb-operated directional controller is rather awkward to use.  You scroll to move up/down and press to move left/right.  To select, you have to press down on the middle.  In my case, to hit select, I had to learn a way to press it just right, otherwise the controller would move left or right instead.  Lastly, while this may not matter much to most people, I frequently use a tripod, which blocks the battery cover and makes changing battery quite a hassle.<br />Despite its shortcomings, I've found the S30 to be an indispensable companion.  I've had it for almost a year and taken it with me on trips to Asia and throughout western North America.  At times I yearned for a more advanced camera like the Canon G2 or even a digital SLR, but more often than not I found myself thankful that I was able to take pictures I wouldn't have taken otherwise with a larger camera. The S30 has more than paid for itself.","I am very happy with the picture quality, but am sad because it is not as portable as I had hoped.  Actually, it flunked this area.  I was keeping the camera in my coat pocket, and within a few weeks, after taking some night pictures near a fire, I noticed all kinds of dust inside the lens was putting little white blurry dots all over my photos.  They don't show up on the day photos, but they are almost like a cloud on the night pictures.  It's really awful, and I'm really disappointed in this.  Upon further inspection of the lense, it is obvious that the sliding door does not fully cover the lens in an air-tight way.  And the door is sort of flimsy.  Stuff can get inside the edges quite easily.  Also, the lens itself is not a sealed thing.  If you look closely at it, you can see that the lens glass in the front has a very small gap all the way around it. The lens must now be cleaned professionally.  This camera is great, but you must keep it in a case, and I'd also advise you keep it in the \"bubble wrap\" within that case.  So much for \"portability\".","I am very happy with the picture quality, but am sad because it is not as portable as I had hoped.  Actually, it flunked this area.

I'll summarize a few points:<br />1) I saw a couple other \"cracked LCD screen\" comments.  This is NOT BS, people.  Ours cracked after just a month or so of use, and under very questionable circumstances.  It may have been the sun.  It may have been a bump.  We don't know.  But it did cost $150 to get it repaired by Canon.  Not cool!<br />2) Shutter speed: out of the box, you WILL be disappointed with the slow shutter speed (blurry pictures).  The default equivalent film sensitivity is \"in the range of ISO 50 to ISO 100\".  Very slow film for most apps.<br />3) Movies: Don't pay $100 extra for the movie capability.  The movies are disappointing in quality (~200x300 pixels) and length (max 30 seconds)<br />These cons aside, the camera often does perform swimmingly.","I love photography and I'm a computer geek! Why did it take me so long to get a digital camera?  I've had this model for 4 days and love it!  I got an extra battery and a 256 MB memory card at the same time. It only comes with a 16 MB card which I got 18 shots on, one of which was a 10sec video.  Not bad but the battery lasted about 10 shots longer.  The battery charges really fast, 20 min or so. So with two batteries this is a good camera for day trips.  My next major purchase will be a car charger.<br />I also like that you can hook it up to the video in jack on your tv and view you pictures and videos there. You can also set up shots on the tv.<br />I highly recommend this camera to anybody with a resonable amount of geekyness. :o)","Searched and searched for a relatively inexpensive high quality digital camera. This one definitely fits the bill. Quick setup, easy to use software, and great quality make this a fantastic buy. Make sure you buy a smart card reader though to help save battery life when downloading pictures.","I love the S30. I bought this camera specifically for underwater use (with the Canon underwater housing of course!). It is pretty easy to use and has quite a few features for the price. You probably won't need a higher pixel camera than this unless you want poster size prints. Add a 1GB IBM Microdrive, a spare battery, and you are set.","I had been looking for a digital camera for personal and family use for a couple of months. Having used the Canon G2 at the art gallery where I work, I was familiar with how a high quality digtial camera works. So I used the G2's features as quidelines for choosing a digital camera for myself. I wanted something smaller than the G2 to make it more portable for travel, etc. less expensive, and yet with similar features. I found just what I was looking for in the Canon Powershot S30. I love it and the images it takes. Image and color capture is great. I still haven't learned or tried all its features, but so far am more than satisfied with my choice and would recommend it highly.","This is a pretty snazzy one and has lots of things I never use. I mostly keep it set on auto. It takes excellent pictures though. I always take them on the highest quality setting - they are bigger than my screen. But then if I get them printed on one of those Picture Maker Machines - they look perfect. You would never know they were from a digital camera.  (This is a 3.2 MegaPixel camera - the only reason I see to go bigger  would be = the bigger the picture, the more you can crop it and still have a high quality picture). One of the best things about the camera is that it has a rechargeable battery - so I never have to buy batteries or film.  I rarely use my regular camera anymore. Also.. It takes great little 30 second movies, and I love to hook it to a tv at parties and show off all the photos I just took. What fun.","You know the performance.<br />You know the features.<br />You know the product.<br />And You know the name.<br />It's a Canon Powershot.<br />Absolutely still the best camera.","I used an olympus c3040 prior to buying this camera and have thi camera for 4 months now. I like this camera's small size for the same MP/zoom range as the c3040. The small size makes it a little shakier, but you will get used to it.<br />It takes very good quality pictures in daylight and fluoroscent lighting and has multiple white balance modes. You can also set your own white balance, which some people may find useful. I find the color and hue saturation with the factory set white balance great and much better than my previous 3MP camera.<br />Night/Low light pics are not as good if you use the auto mode. Remember to set the setting to P (program) mode for night shots. Manual modes are great for low light situations and this camera works like any other non-digital (SLR-35 mm Film) camera.<br />The RAW format images are useful to make even larger sized prints using appropriate software.<br />I think the software bundled with the camera ... when used on windows 98. All they needed to do was to have windows 98 recognize it as another drive, but they made it twain based instead and boy that really ... for me. I have to go thru hoops to download pics to my windows 98 machine. However if you have XP, it is a breeze to use the camera and once you install the drivers it works like any other camera.<br />I recommend reading the manual at least 3 times before using the advanced functions. The manual is somewhat technical but you need to read it!<br />There is an available attachment for underwater pics, which is also great if you just want to use it in the summer on a beach or to take underwater pictures. As far as I know no other digital camera offers this yet.<br />I also like the Photostitch option that allows you to take multiple pictures and then weave them together to get a large sized (panoramic) picture. You can combine multiple pictures to get a huge poster (even 40x40 inches) for example by using this function.<br />It comes with a 16MB CF card which is rather small (holds 16-24 pics in high resolution and only 6-8 pics in RAW format). Now that 128/256/512 MB CF cards are available you may want to pick one up. However then you will also need an extended battery or an AC power pack as you will run out of power before you use the entire CF card.<br />If you have no computer, this blighter can even print directly to a compatible printer, which is cool if you are travelling.<br />I also would have really liked canon to include a small leather case with this, but then one can't ask for all!<br />I still feel I have not found out all this camera can do even at 4 months and there are many features that I have not tried yet.<br />The multipurpose button is sturdy, but some what difficult to use. Also they could have combined to zoom function to the same button (like in many videocams) for better funtionality while shooting. However I got used to the small buttons now and am really not finding it that much of a problem.","I just returned home from a week long trip having just purchased my s30 and like several others on here I debated the s230 and the s30. Wow...what a great camera the s30 is..I really don't have a bad word to say about it except maybe the rocker button on it is a little hard to work. This is my third digital camera and I purchased this one based on its size, my other two were too big to be any use although they took fine pictures they were nothing compared to this beauty.<br />  I've printed several 8x10's that I shot in medium 2 resolution that are flawless and this using an older Epson 880 printer, I can only imagine what high resolution must look like. Anyway you will not be disappointed with this camera...trust me I take a lot of pictures and the s30 just makes it that much more fun. This is one device that delivers as advertised.","I have been looking for 2 months for a good digicam, checked out every site, every review, every everything. I bought the s30 camera and all I have to say is, WHAT A CAMERA!...Whether you are a novice like me who wants to just shoot great pics, or a more advanced person who wants to mess around with all the manual settings, you wont be dissappointed!...<br />Do yourself a favor, stop worrying about whether the camera youre going to buy will be good......dump it and get the Canon s30!","I bought this camera in the Caribean so I could get rid of my disposable cameras!  The battery charged in an hour and was ready to use the same day!  I am so pleased with my pictures and the software.  I was lucky that when I bought this camera I was GIVEN a 64mb memory card along with the camera for a very good price.  This camera is so easy to use that you will definately want to get a larger memory card than the 16MB it comes with!  Great camera for vacation, and home!","I shopped around and read a lot of reviews before I bought the<br />S30. I am an amateur photographer with a little more experience than most people and wanted manual exposure settings and manual focus. Many digital cameras out there do not have manual focus. This camera is an awesome machine for the size. the controls are intuitive. My pictures have been turning out great on auto settings.I had been thinking of buying the Sony cameras with the CD-r capability, but have to say that downloading pictures with the Canon is a breeze. The computer even detects the camera as soon as you plug it in to the USB cable. Software was easy to install on both Windows ME and XP and works well to touch up pictures.","I love this camera. I originally received a HP Photosmart 320 as a gift, but it was too basic a camera and had poor image quality especially if the digital zoom was used (there was no Optical zoom). The person who gave it to me suggested I return it if better quality was something I wanted. So I did some research and came to two possible cameras to trade in for, both made by Canon, the HP reviews just were good enough. I originally went in search for the A40 but being after Xmas it was sold out, so I browsed at the S30 and was convinced to spend the extra money on it, I knew the reviews were awesome for this camera so, So I made the decision and have not regretted since.<br />The S30 takes high quality pictures, no comparison to the HP.<br />Setting up the software was originally a problem, I was using Windows 98 and there was simply no response when the camera was connected. I had the intention of upgrading to windows 2000, which I did within 2 days of my purchase and my problem was gone and I am now able to upload my pictures. Wow they look great.<br />Now, being a Canadian we have cold weather and snow so taking the camera outside is risky, especially when it is snowing, I needed something to protect the camera form the elements. I was able to find the camera underwater casing but it cost was just too much, costing half as much as the camera itself. I do intend to use the camera in and around water, but going any deeper than 10 feet is overkill for me. So the camera case currently is not an option, especially since I am a student with a limited budget. I looked online and came across a British made waterproof pouch called Aquapac which claimed to be 100% waterproof and was rigorously tested. I ordered it and it cost me only about $40.<br />Now I just have to get some extra memory and a spare battery.<br />If you meet somebody with the Canon S30, they will only have good things to say about this camera and.....Remember to say \"CHEESE!\"","I used to own a fairly bulky epson photoPC 750z and I wanted a camera that could more easily fit in a pocket (what good is a camera that you never want to carry around with you?).  To be honest, the color on the 750z (which is only a 2MP camera vs. 3 for the s230) was better than on this camera, but I'm willing to sacrifice some quality for the seriously tiny form factor of this camera.  I was also pleasantly surprised at the ability to be able to shoot video with this camera.  I was in NY for new years and took some video at the stroke of midnight.<br />...","Before I purchased my s30 , I was orginally going to get the s230. Considering that the s30 had a drop of price to 400 , and now it was the same price as the s230 , that made my decision difficult. Many people buy the s230 because of its size, and that was the reason I was going to get it. But before I purchased a camera I played with both of them and the s230 is so small its hard to navigate between the different shooting modes and I knew I would not take the same quality pictures with it and it did not have the same zoom (6x as opposed 10x), I decided to go with the s30 and I am very PLEASED!!!! its great and the menu's are so easily accesible and I love it! the only con is the movie's are limited to 30 seconds each .(but you can tape many of them on your memeory card depending on its size.) Definetly canon is the way to go!!!!!!!!!! now whether you go for size or better camera is your choice , but trust me the s30 is a much better overall camera and it is not much bigger.","This camera is great for the photography enthusiast.  It has lots of great options and features built-in (e.g. the ability to take short movie clips).<br />However, the \"paddle\" button control is a little annoying.  My fingers are an average size, but it's still hard at times to scroll and use the menu options because of this odd button.  Also, its price is still a little on the high side (I purchased this when it was retailing for about $$$).  However, you do get what you pay for -- this camera is worth every cent.<br />Otherwise, it's a great camera.  Its size is a definite plus for someone who wants great pictures without the heavy accessories!","This is our first digital camera. I wanted one that was easy to use, could take  photos as good as a 35mm camera and allow you to be creative. The S30 is very easy to use.<br />I bought this camera to take with us on a ten day cruise.So far we have taken over 250 photos and printed the ones we wanted, down loaded some into our computer and reused the card for more photos.<br />The photo's were as good as my 35 mm Canon SLR. Everyone that we showed the photo's and the S30 to, were all impressed. Three of them are going to buy this camera.<br />I do recommend you buy a 128mb or larger flash card and an extra battery. For me the battery lasted all day and at night I just charged it up.<br />We are very satisfied and highly recommend the Canon S30.","I've owned about 5 digital cameras in my life and this is by far better than anything I've ever seen.  The first rule about digital photography is that a camera only takes great photos when you take it with you.  If it's too big to carry everywhere you won't get much use out of it.  The S30 has a flat shape and travels well - far better than any fuji, nikon or kodak I've owned before.  Second, the photos it takes are spectacular.  While recently studying abroad I took about 2800 photos and the clarity and color of the shots I took is better than a traditional APS film camera.  I have been very surprised with how well these shots come out when I take them to Costco or Shutterfly for printing (even at 8x10 and larger).<br />It also has some additional features I tend to use a lot more than I expected.  A lot of cameras out there today offer the ability to take 30 second movies, but very few also offer sound.  The S30 has a built in microphone that makes this feature far more useful and the clips you take much more memorable.  Watching a movie of your friends laughing at a joke isn't very funny if you can't hear the punch line.  This ability to take small clips and fit the camera into a pocket also eliminated my need to buy a separate video camera.  The panorama feature is also a ton of fun to play with and my home now has 30 inch prints of panoramas I've taken in various cities around the world.<br />Finally, Canon has by far the easiest and most intuitive software for organizing and archiving photos on your computer.  Amazingly, the software is simple enough for anyone to pick up but robust enough that hard-core enthusiasts like myself still use it to do nearly everything.  Even the using the camera itself is a no-brainer to figure out.<br />Get a larger memory card and I recommend an extra battery if you are planning on traveling with it.  I am probably one of the most critical people when it comes to electronics but this camera has exceeded every expectation I've had and I plan to hold onto it for a long time.","I researched digital cameras for several weeks before purchasing the S30 for my wife as a replacement for her point and shoot film camera. The camera is easy to use and takes great pictures right out of the box (Of course you need to charge the battery first).  Most of the shots we has taken so far have been in the \"Auto\" mode and exposures both indoor and out are excellent.  The S30 is loaded with so many features it should satisfy even the more advanced shutterbugs.<br />Two things I would recommend, an extra battery and larger CF card as the S30 only comes with a 16MB card and a single battery.<br />I do agree with some of the other reviews that the joystick takes a little getting used to; otherwise I would have given this camera 5 stars.","trying to decide between S230 and S30 was a hard one: S230 is significantly smaller and much cuter (very much a girl's camera); but s30 has 3x zoom and slightly better optical properties. after going back and forth, i finally decided on s30 and have been very happy with it.<br />bottom line: if you're looking for portability, go for the S230 because the s30 is too thick to fit in your pocket. however, if you're caring a purse/bag/case around anyway, get this one! (i also found a cheaper price elsewhere so make sure you look around.)","We researched digital cameras for 15 months before buying this one. It's awesome! Takes excellent pictures and is fairly easy to use.  I purchased a Kodak 4900 for my mom and it felt so light. I love the weight and sturdiness of this camera. It is all metal!<br /> I am used to a point and shoot. This camera has it all. The point and shoot ease with the ability to take more advanced photos. I have had it for 6 months and have taken 100's of photos. The only downside is the battery. I have yet to purchase a second one which would be great for travel. I have not run into any problems with the battery dying. It charges very rapidly and it just takes a bit of thought.  At home I keep it charged and charge it before I leave on a trip. It takes WONDERFUL indoor and even better outdoor pictures. I definetly recommend purchasing a 256mb memory card. The software works well and my pics download within seconds. We don't even need a card reader.  Overall, a great buy! I would now only upgrade to a G2 because It would be great to learn about the lenses. But for the family who wants a point and shoot camera for the kids and one that can take postcard like photos you won't be disappointed with this  purchase. Great job Canon!","This is my second digital camera and from what I see thus far this will most likely be my last. I think I've found the perfect digital camera. Check out the positives and negatives with the PowerShot S30.<br />Positives: (where do I begin?)<br />* Made of solid, sturdy metal. Feels like a real camera not a cheap plastic toy like other digital cameras.<br />* Has features galore!!! Has standard features plus some pretty nice extras such as:<br />-customizable flash-can change the strength of the flash, helping to prevent washed out pictures which is common with most digital cameras when you use the flash.<br />-flips landscapes pictures that would normally appear sideways. the camera lets you flip these pictures rightside up so you won't have to do it on your computer.<br />-can take panoramic pictures.<br />-the camera is customizable! What does this mean? This camera lets you customize the startup screen. You have an option between clear blue water, evening skyline or a sitting bird. You can change the startup sound, your options include a default theme, science fiction and animal sounds(dog barking or bird chirping). These sounds are designed to presumably match the startup screens but they can be mix and matched. The shutter also has various sounds you can choose from. All these sounds can, of course, be turned off.<br />-this list goes on and on. Check this camera out to see everything.<br />* Superb true true-to-life daytime and night pictures.<br />* Pictures come out crisp and sharp with or without the flash, in<br />brightly lit or darky lit areas.<br />* What you see is what you get. What you see on the LCD screen is usually how the pictures will appear on your computer monitor or when you print them out. The LCD, when you press lightly on the<br />shutter button, will show you actually how the picture will appear once viewed on screen or on paper. So if your LCD has a bright contrast and you are in a dark room, when you press the shutter button lightly, the LCD will adjust itself to the actual lighting of the room. There will be no deception and you won't have to wonder why the pictures look lighter on the LCD than on the computer screen or in print.<br />* Can record mini movies with sound.<br />* Uses compact flash card.<br /><br />There is much, much more that I can add on to this list but you will have get this camera and see for yourself.<br />Negatives:<br />* Hard to install the driver software on th PC. I had to ask Canon tech support for help. Even then the process was very confusing.<br />* Joystick navigator takes some getting used to. Very hard to maneuver through the menus resulting in accidently going to the wrong options.<br />* There is no power button. You have to shut the lens' lid to turn off the camera. This makes me nervous. I'm always scared that this will somehow damage the lens.<br />* The macro setting isn't the best. Sometimes the macro pictures can appear blurry.<br />* Uses the very expensive NB-2L rechargable battery as opposed to inexpensive, more common rechargables such as NiMHs or other types. Plus NB-2Ls can only be used with PowerShot S30, S40 cameras and Elura 40mc camcorders.<br />I was initially put off by the price of this camera but I must say it is well worth the money.<br />Get the Canon PowerShot S30 if you want superior quality in a small package.","I recently bought my s30 along with the ibook and am set. This little camera is small, sleek, and light. It is easy to use, and after reading the instructions I can even use the fancy features such as preset contrast( to prevent washout) and a 'cockle doodle doo' to signal a self timer shot (makes every one laugh). These are only a few of the many features included. The quality is also exceptional. Digital cameras sometimes have trouble with 'action' shots. This camera took a crisp close up of my girls face, hair in the wind, while swinging. Enlarged to 8x11, it is great. This point and shoot is great.","This camera was the best purchase I have ever made.  After careful searching on the web and reading reviews I settled on this camera.  I purchased this camera a year ago and wanted to wait to write the review so you could hear from someone who has owned for more than a weekend.  Now, of course the S40 is the same price as I paid for the s30 and would purchase that if you have the money.  I thought the s30 was a little more than I wanted to spend, but I have always been into photography and liked all the options, and loved the small size.  I have never once regretted spending a little over my budget on this camera.  I mean, how many digital cameras can you adjust the shutter speed, over expose or under expose, set all different kinds of light setting, adjust the flash, and be so easy to use a person with no photography knowledge can use.  This camera really can do it all!  On top of that, the picture quality is amazing.  Even printing out on my 150 dollar printer with photo paper my friends swear that they were professionaly developed.  If you send them into shutterfly.com, you will NEVER be able to tell they were taken from a digital camera.  I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great all around digital camera that can do everything an SLR can do.","I bought this camera in April 2002 (right before I had my first baby).  As of this month Dec 02, I have taken almost 3,000 pictures.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!  It's small yet durable.  I am a picture fanatic.  I take a camera with me everywhere I go.  Now, I've become so dependant on this digital one, I don't even take another camera with me.  The pictures turn out excellent and it is very quick and easy to download.  The only problem I have had is keeping the battery charged.  I bought an additional battery and think that it is definitely necessary (if you take lots of pictures).  I even take my pictures in a medium resolution and they still turn out excellent.  I usually fit over 200 photos on a 128 MB card.  Well worth the money!","I always read everyone else's reviews, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to write one of my own. I am compelled because I absolutely LOVE this camera (Canon S30).<br />I almost did not purchase it because the demo one at the local electronics store was pretty beat up and I wasn't sure it could handle all the possible dings that little items like this can suffer. Well, I swore I would keep it in it's bubble wrap and case for as long as possible, especially after reading the review of the person who got the cracked LCD. So far, this camera has been to Tahoe, Norway and Korea and has not suffered one bit. It's very easy to use and very intuitive. The only ding I might give it, is sometimes when trying to navigate through the menus, the set button doesn't always work (maybe I have big fingers?).<br />The pictures are fantastic. I am one who had a decent SLR camera, but never could get great pictures. I enjoy the speed at which it downloads to my computer. I also very much enjoy the panorama feature and how great the pictures look on my 22\" monitor at work (yes, my boss spoils me!!). Definitely purchase another compact flash card for it (at least 128 mb).<br />Anyway, I'm not one to give recommendations normally, but if you buy this, you will not be sorry.","the s30 is well built... very robust on the exterior... and performance has met all of my expectations... i've taken great pictures in auto mode... the manual controls (shutter speed and/or aperture) are great for those photos that the auto mode can't quite get right... flash is great... film iso's of 50,100,200,400,800... night shots are terrific... 3x optical zoom... also got the canon i850 printer to go along with the s30 which produces perfect prints... there are more features that i didn't mention but i am one satisfied customer...","I found this camera to be all it was said to be regarding features.  Picture clarity and movie clarity were very good.  However, the camera is very heavy for a camera in this size range.  I can't see it in a case on your belt walking around, and I believe most of us intend to carry our cameras around.  I returned it in search of something lighter.  If you are not concerned about weight, then this camera has everything you need.","I have this camera for like 3 months now. I love it so far other than the battery dies on you all the time and you have to recharge it if you don't have a spair. So if you do get this camera get anther battery or two it be woth it if you are somewhere when your battery goes down and can't recharge it when you need it most.","The best 3.2 MP camera you can get for that price, can be used as point and shot, but this is not what it made for.<br />Endless features are packed into this relatively small body, very high built quality, feels like a little brick, image quality is a full 10, I did print 8x11 images that are very hard to distinguish from film.<br />If you have no patience to read it's 144-page manual, don't bother, you are wasting your money, I got amazing results once I was able to master it, took me about one month.","Just check out the majority of these reviews.  There are very few complaints.  This is a great camera.  It is very technologically advanced--I have owned it for almost two months and have still not figured out all the features.  The main thing I love is that it is so, so easy to hook it up to my computer and download freshly-taken pictures instantly.<br /><br />One suggestion, buy the extra memory card (128--click on accessories link) when you order your camera so you can take an enormous amount of pictures at once and store them all on the card until you have the time to sit at your computer and download.  I have never even used the included 16 card.<br /><br />It comes with cables and software, as well as a wall charger for the battery and a small memory card.  My battery has lasted a really long time so far.  I am very impressed.  The wall charger has a green indicator light on it that shows when your battery is charged.  That is a very handy feature for those of us who are in a hurry and cannot keep track of how long we have a battery on a charger!<br /><br />The quality of pictures is awesome!  I bought the Canon photo printer for my computer.  I can print directly from my camera without even powering up the ol' HP!  How great is that?!<br /><br />I love the LCD screen.  Now, I have not taken the little plastic cover off the screen, for fear that I might scratch it.  However, if you spring for a camera bag or carrying case, I believe your fears of harming the screen can be put to ease.<br /><br />Buy this camera if you are looking for a good, affordable digital camera well worth the money.  It includes all the features most novices demand, like zoom, short movie making, auto focus, red-eye reduction, and automatic light sensoring for the flash.<br /><br />Update:  I wrote this review about two years ago and I still have the camera and still use it regularly.  It is still in great condition.  I still love it!","I bought this for a trip to Australia.  It's beautiful, easy to use and produces high quality pictures.  You will probably need a number of accessories, so you should consider their cost when making this purchase.  (Same is true for other digital cameras.) My accessory suggestions:<br />1.  You need more memory.  I bought a 256MB flash memory card which was enough to store about 150 pictures.<br />2.  You might consider getting a second battery if you're going to be using the camera much between charges.<br />3.  You will need to buy a camera case.  I bought it locally so I could find one that held my accessories comfortably and compactly.<br />4.  I also bought an underwater housing for the camera.  I took 50 or so photo's while scuba diving on the GBR.  Worked perfectly.  If I had known, I would have rented a slave flash unit for even better underwater shots.","If you're looking for dozens of image, flash, zoom, and exposure settings, in a small package, you've got the right camera. The Canon Powershot S30 camera is clearly not a camera intended for photography professionals who want to take hundreds of pictures at different resolutions, want to play with the lighting and other effects, as well as have the ability to zoom into the object many times over. However, it is a complete package. The S30 offers features found in much larger cameras at twice the price for half the price at a much smaller size. The S30 is a compact camera, widely acknowledged as the best bang-for-your-buck camera in its size on the market.<br />The S30 is virtually identical to its cousin the S40, with several minor differences. The S40 shoots at a slightly higher resolution, has one additional shooting mode, and is 4 megapixels as opposed to the S30's 3.2. However, the S40 is commonly found for over [$$$] more, and these features, in my opinion, are not worth the investment. The S30 shoots images at the maximum resolution of 2048x1536 pixels, at a 3.2 Megapixel resolution. Similar cameras of similar sizes offered by competitors top off at around 2.1 Megapixels, without paying premium prices.<br />The S30 offers thirteen different shooting modes, all of which can take advantage of its 3X optical or 10x digital zoom from the automatic, where the ISO speed, flash, and shutter speeds are calculated by the camera, to the movie mode, which can record up to 30 seconds of full-audio AVI film at 320x160 resolution, and approximately 20 frames per second. Other modes include portrait, speed, and slow modes. These can be used to shoot pictures of objects up close, where the foreground recieves more exposure than the background, as well as to capture objects, whether fast or slow, in motion with little blur (fast/slow shooting modes). The camera also allows you, with additional settings, to set the shutter speed, ISO settings (up to 800) and lighting setting with a touch of a button.<br />The S30 accepts both Type 1 and Type 2 compactflash cards, including the IBM microdrive, which comes in sizes up to 1 GB - more than enough space to store approximately 600 pictures, shot at the maximum quality and size on the S30. Because of the camera's size, it might be expected that the battery, card, and all other \"removable\" parts would be hard to access and would require large fingernails. However, Canon has made a small slot on the bottom with several spring mechanisms which allow easy access for the card (when ejected) as well as the battery.<br />The LCD is brilliant, and captures much of the color in the viewfinder. Upon moving the pictures to my computer, I found that they looked virtually identical in thumbnail form as they did at their maximum resolution. You can also set the LCD to turn off or on, in order to conserve battery power.<br />Right out of the box, the camera is very easy to use. The on/off switch is built right into the lens cover, so simply popping in the rechargable battery and flash card and sliding open the lens cover allows for virtually instantaneous use. The \"AUTO\" mode allows for simple point-and-shoot use, with the camera selecting the right settings, auto-focusing, and taking the picture with a fake shutter \"click\" sound. (Installing custom software allows you to customize this shutter sound to a soundbyte of your own creation or choosing). Once the pictures have been taken, the camera also can be connected directly to certain Canon printers to print images directly out of the camera.<br />The camera does have some weaknesses, however. Because of its size, the flash is rather weak, and is quite sensitive if your hand is accidentally cupped over part of it - the image exposure will increase in the top left hand corner. Also, the control pad is sometimes difficult to operate as some operations require that you push it in. I found myself several times pushing the left or right accidentally as I tried to depress the button evenly to produce the desired result. Also, the S30 is a battery hog. An extra battery is a requirement for this camera, as its batteries rarely last over 70 pictures - although I have heard otherwise.<br />All in all, the S30 is an excellent camera with many benefits that far outweigh its negative points. With the ability of both the novice and the professional to take advantage of its 3x optical zoom, manual or autofocus, and its 13 different shooting modes, the S30 is a camera for everybody...at an affordable price.","I have two digital cameras now, and have researched this area extensively.  This camera has some great options: Compact Flash memory cards, great zoom power, movie mode, overrides on everything, a panoramic stich mode, it feels high quality (some of the cameras I checked out locally felt cheap).  This camera is so packed with features, it also takes excellent automatic photos too.  We're very happy with our purchase!","Using the camera in the Auto mode takes nice pictures(basically point and shoot) very nice for the begginers. The maual mode is where you will get it's best. However, Use of the manual mode will take little more understanding in basic operation of camera. What is minimum or basic?Personally--->EX: you should atleast know what the shuttle speed and amperature is. if not, you still can study...but if not planning on professional use, consider somthing cheaper. I bought this and love it. I am not a pro photographer but have basic experience plus  I love challenge/learning. so far the only complaint is the Multi controller which is hard to select. the battery was ok for me. I dont think ill get  an extra. go to local electronics store and try it out.<br />Conclusion:have the money, like new challenge, great pictures... buy it. I dont have bit of regret, but thats me.","With the compact flash, I can immediately print the pictures by inserting into the Photosmart printer.  While the compact flash is in the printer, I can view the pictures on my computer, send them in email form or transfer them to be edited.  Movies with sound can be made with the camera and viewed directly on the computer by inseting the flash card into the printer.  There is no need for cables or other hookups.  Length of the movie will depend on size of the flash card.","This is the best camera I've ever owned.  Very user friendly, great pictures for online and print.  Love the 30 sec video feature, B&W, antique, ... When purchasing, be sure to get an extra battery even though the battery can be used for a couple of hours. Also get a 256k card, holds up to 200 high quality pics and more if you decrease the resolution giving you up to at least 1000 shots.  LOVE IT!!!!","I am constantly teased by friends that I am the most thorough consumer they know, so it wasn't unusual when I spent about a month comparing digital camera reviews before buying this camera. (Great reviews can also be found on photographyreview.com and dpreview.com). My criteria for buying a digital camera were that it be a compact 3 megapixel, have a good zoom, have the capability of being manual or automatic, and that it have GREAT image quality. This camera has it all.<br />I took a huge risk using this camera for the first time on a trip to London in February. (I also purchased a 128MB CompactFlash card and extra battery---a necessity). I read the manual on the plane, and set off to take pictures. I took 140 pictures on the 128MB card at highest resolution--even deleted several pictures to fit more.<br />I got home a week later, anxious to see whether the photographs would be a cause to celebrate or to auction the camera on E-bay. I printed the photos myself on a photo printer (more on that later), and they looked like postcards.... the color was awesome, the images were sharp---I was sorry that I didn't take more CompacFlash cards with me!<br />I printed the pics on the Hewlett Packard Photosmart 100, which is a miniscule, portable printer that will print directly from CompacFlash and other media cards (without being connected to a computer)--see reviews on amazon[.com]. The printing quality is amazing, and I now travel with it so I can print my pictures while on vacation.<br />And my friends that make fun of me? Four of them now own this camera and the printer......","If you used any line of Canon EOS SLRs you will be very comfortable with this little guy.  There isn't much the S30 can't do.<br />I bought the S30 with some consideration for others, like Sony(Overpriced), Fuji, Kodak(minimal features) or Nikon.<br />The only down side is it is a bit cumbersome in large hands.","I researched digital cameras at length before I settled on the S30.  There were a number of competitors with 3X optical zoom, with compact size, and with sharp display panels. The detail that persuaded me was the battery life - and I am thoroughly pleased.  I took the S30 to a party and not only took 70 shots (many of which were moving targets - dancing) but also spent a fair amount of time replaying them for the subjects' pleasure. The Lithium ion battery held up for the entire party.  The battery also recharges in only 80 minutes, so I did not feel the need to purchase a backup battery -- a big saving.  I did get an optional 128 MB CompactFlash card -- I recommend that.  I took all those shots at highest resolution and still had plenty of memory left. I also purchased a CompactFlash Card media reader which reads the card directly into the computer without using the camera's battery OR needing an AC powercord -- another saving. I cropped several of the candid shots, then printed at 8 1/2 X 11, with excellent results. My friends requested reprints to give to their families for Christmas. I have promised to take the photographs for an upcoming family wedding, and I have no reservations about the quality this camera can deliver.  Love this camera!","I purchased this camera about six months ago. I wanted a camera that was simple to use, with metal construction, and that took great pictures--and the camera is all that.<br />Sure, nothing is perfect. The goofy rubber cover on the mini-USB port is an anoyance to open, the port is next to the base where the cover is attached to the camera--a real pain, specially since you have to mess with it to download the pictures to the  computer. Another issue is the power adapter. It requires taking the battery out to insert a piece in the shape of the battery. It is not only clumsy, the battery door remains open, and the door is plastic and somewhat flimsy.<br />The serious problem is Mac OS X support. The camera has a \"stitch assist\" feature to help taking panoramic pictures. The actual stitching is done on the computer using PhotoStitch, which automates the task. This software is essential for taking panoramic pictures. The camera software bundle does not include Mac OS X versions of the programs, and although some of the programs are available for download, PhotoStitch is *only* available by purchasing (for $20 more) the new version of the software bundle CD.","I've had the camera for about 6 months and could NOT have found a better camera for the money.  Picture quality is great, movie mode with sound is an added bonus, plus all the manual features make every picture turn out perfectly.  3.2 meg is the pefect balance between quality and card space used.  The ability to use the RAW CCD data sets this camera apart from even more expensive ones.<br /><br />  But enough about the camera.  The accessories you MUST get include of course, one or two more batteries (Lithium last longer than Nickel-Cad, and can be gotten on the web...  a 128 or larger card (prefer them over the microdrive because the micro can skip while writing if the camera is bumped or when driving);  THE camera bag to get is the Lowepro D-Res 20AW.  The bag holds the camera snugly in place inside it.  It has a shoulder strap or can be worn on your belt.  It has an elasticized waterproof cover that comes out of the bottom of it to cover the already water-resistant bag when on your belt or when carrying.  However, the real beauty of the bag is on the inside.  No scratching of the camera or LCD because it is lined with a soft brushed material.  To save the LCD from scratches outside the bag I use PDA screen protector film cut to fit.  There is a pouch for holding another CF card, extra batteries in front of that, and the bonus is a pocket along the left side that one of those 4 or 5 inch flexible tripods slides into just perfectly.  The bag is also padded all around the exterior.  Both the bag and tripod can be purchased at any [local store]...  The only other thing I can think of right now is the Canon underwater case for scuba diving or to keep the sand and rain off the camera at the beach.  Also would be good for capturing falling rain on the slow shutter setting for that cool effect of streaming water.","This is a fantastic camera. It will take a while to learn the myriad of features, but it's worth it. Get the 128Mb (or more) compact flash card. You'll thank yourself later. My only three grumbles about this camera are that the battery will last about 1.5 hours, digital zoom is a bit blurry (optical zoom is excellent, by the way), and no camera case came with the camera. Hence, the four out of five stars...","Easy to use, lots of features, excellent price.","As a creative picture taker, I was not about to throw a couple hundred bucks toward a digicam that only took webshots or Point-and-shoot snapshots.  I wanted a camera that would take great pictures today and tomorrow and protect my investment.<br />The S30 takes great pix in the Auto and Program modes (just point and shoot!)  But for my creative side, this camera includes most of the features and manual overrides of the higher priced Canon G2.  This gives the camera the ability to capture difficult and amazing shots.  Exposure Lock, Shutter- and Aperature-priority, ISO settings up to 800 ASA.  3 metering modes.  Long shutter times (up to 15s) with noise reduction.  Great colors!  The stitch assist mode and software make for *seamless* panoramas.  Movies are more fun than I expected!  The camera is a joy to use, *very* snappy especially for action shots when pre-metered.<br />Have had it for a couple weeks, long enough to get 4x6 and 8x10 prints back from an online developer.  A few of my better informed friends were highly impressed - would have been hard pressed to identify these as digital pix.<br />Downsides:  limited flash range and no hotshoe.  Manual focusing is virually useless (uses the lo-res LCD).  Buy a bigger flash and second battery.<br />Very impressed and well worth the wait.  No what do I do with the old SLR?","I got this camera for my birthday, and it is the best camera I've ever used.  The quality of the pictures is great, and with a 128 memory card you can take up to 140 pictures.  It has a movie option too which is so much fun to use.  My friends and family love seeing the videos of them, and I send out digital photo albums all the time to everyone.  I would highly recommend this camera to beginners or experienced photographers.  People that have tried my camera are now ditching their older models to upgrade to this one.  It's light, compact, and incredibly easy to learn to use.","This is my very first digital camera and I just got it about a month ago. I'm not really an expert on cameras but here are my views when it comes to the camera so far:<br />The camera is nice and compact but it is quite heavy so it is not that easy to carry it aroundin your pocket.<br />I have heard people complaining about the battery capacity. So far it has not been a problem for me but why didn't canon include som battery indicator?<br />It is nice to have a lens cover but it seems a bit fragile at times.<br />The multicontrol button/joystick is not always easy to operate.<br />Apart from this I'm having a great time with the camera and the quality of the pictures are great.","I've had this camera for less than a week and I couldn't be more pleased. I use big 5MP Sony cameras at school and the little SC30 runs circles around them as far as features and ease of use goes. Be sure to pick up another battery and at least a 128Mb Flash Card. My only compliant is that the camera's size and viewfinder is a little small for my big head!","I've owned the Canon Powershot S30 for about two months now and am still amazed daily at how well this little camera can take pictures!  Pictures come out so clear it is amazing!  The prints I have made from my computer look EXACTLY like professionally developed prints.  All of my friends have been amazed at the quality and clarity, \"You did this from a computer and digital camera!\" they have often responded.<br />Not only is the picture quality superb, but the ease of use is wonderful.  The LCD screen features handy little guides that help to frame and focus your pictures just right.  Pre-focusing lets you know if all your elements are right for the perfect picture.<br />I haven't yet ventured into all the more advanced features of the S30 yet, but I hope to soon.  From reading the owner's manual, there appears to be an endless amount of experimentation yet to be had.<br />Suggestions for use of this camera include purchasing a bigger Compact flash card.  I use of 256mb card and haven't completely filled it yet.  Also look into an extra set of batteries because this camera can drain some power!  These can be quite difficult to find, unlike many other Canon accessories.  You only the original CANON brand battery.  I have only been able to find this battery on the Canon website, but I have yet to check with the more upscale camera stores in my area.<br />I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone wanting to print there own pictures.  This camera has completely replaced by other non-digital Canon camera!  A good accessory for this camera is a good quality photo camera. Epson has a wonderful model for under cost.","Having purchased 3 different digital cameras that I would put in the everyday users class, this camera easily beats out anything I've seen in the market or used before.<br />Phenomenally simple to use in auto mode, just point and click, although you may find that pictures at night are not the best in this mode, no problem though just move the dial over to night pictures and viola you're the next Ansel Adams.<br />I would recommend getting a Sandisk USB digital card reader to hook into your computer. Then all you need to do is pop out the card from the camera, slide it into your reader and it acts as another hard drive on your machine. It's 10 times easier then hooking the camera up to the computer to download pics.<br />I would recommend anyone to purchase this computer.","I just had my Olympus c3040 stolen, so now I need a new camera.  I<br />borrowed a Canon S30 from one friend and an S40 from the other.  I<br />have decided to go with Canon, and I am chosing the S30 over the S40<br />because it's faster in a couple of ways than the S40 due to smaller<br />image sizes.  I am not ready to deal with 4 megapixel images yet.<br />Here's some more information on why I am not going back to Olympus.<br />1: The Olympus is slower in displaying pictures, focusing, getting<br />ready for the next shot, accessing menus, etc.  The canon is just much<br />faster.<br />2: The LCD on the Canon shows you what you're going to see in the<br />final shot.  E.g., if the shot is over-exposed, you can tell before<br />you take it, and you can see what will happen if you adjust the<br />exposure as you adjust the exposure.  The Olympus LCD always looked<br />dark and off color to me and didn't seem to reflect reality, and<br />consequently I never used it except for macro mode.  The Canon's LCD<br />seems very fast as you move the camera around for your next shot.  I<br />will use the LCD for most shots on the Canon.<br />3: The LCD is still quite visible in outdoor lighting conditions.<br />4: The menus on the Canon are easily invoked and accessed, and sit on<br />top of the image you're composing instead of covering the image until<br />you've made your choice.  Olympus menus are a pain to navigate, and<br />they are not very visible in the sun light, whereas Canon menus seem<br />to be right there where you need them.<br />5: Canon uses compact flash, olympus uses smart media.  I had more<br />smart media cards go bad than you can believe, and smart media is more<br />espensive than compact flash.<br />6: The Canon's image histogram is a useful and helpful feature for<br />helping you take better shots.  It's also very cool.<br />7: The Olympus is better in one crucial situation: low light pictures<br />are only possible if you are within flash range.  I have pictures of<br />my daughter's indoor dance perforamnce that I took with my Olympus<br />last year, and now have similar pictures I took with the S30.  The S30<br />ones need to be deleted - they are blurred because there wasn't enough<br />light.  The Olympus took amazingly clear and crisp pictures in that<br />low light situation, even when fully zoomed.  That's because its lens is<br />f/1.8 and the S30 is the more standard f/2.8.  The Canon G2 has an<br />F/2.0 which is closer, but some of the other functions on that camera<br />are very slow, and that camera is too big and heavy.<br />In summary, once I used the Canon for a while I couldn't bear the<br />thought of going back to the Olympus and smartmedia.  The one thing<br />that worried me was the low light photos, but I think I can live<br />without that.  I still have a good SLR camera that I can whip out on<br />those rare occasions ...","This is a great camera. It has an array of easy to use features that make set up for various situations very easy.<br />It has a tremendous light range, from bright daylight to dark interiors using default settings.<br />With 3MP images, I'd recommend at least 256MB of flash memory.<br />If you take a lot of pictures a second battery would be worthwhile.  Taking 100 shots in a day was well beyond the limits of a single battery.<br />The biggest problem is the delay between pushing the button and the actual shutter snap.  On moving objects you have to go to the sports mode(with lesser quality) or it will get away.<br />That said, I see no need to ever use a film camera again.","First of all, this camera really works great, as repeated stated by other reviewers. Just want to point out a few extra good things:<br />1. This camera's menu is highly customizable. You can embed your own picture and voice into the menu system. Most important to me, I can choose from most of the major languages in the world. If you are sending this to friends overseas, this would really help!<br />2. This camera can take video in both PAL and NTSC format, and the battery charger is both 110V and 220V compatible. These are also extremely important if you want to give it to friends in other contries, or simply bring it with you on your trip around the world.<br />3. The 'Macro' function of the S30 works perfect! I took many close-up pictures of flowers, and was really surprised by the professional quality of the photos!<br />Overall, a great, 'oversea travel' friendly camera, and no, you don't need to spend extra money for the S40 simply to increase your downloading time.","I've owned this camera for about 6 weeks and have taken more than 300 pictures. So far, it has performed admirably under a wide variety of situations. It has all of the options (shutter speed and aperture control, white balance, etc.) that my high end Canon SLR camera has -- and more. I doubt if I've scratched the surface yet. The quality is excellent (although keeping still the fraction of a second after you hit the shutter release takes some getting used to -- a few blurry pics at first). Macro option is incredible.<br />Image compression can be set for very high resolution (good enough for reproduction in quality magazines) or lower resolution (for web images).<br />...<br />The only minor complaint I have is that it is a very SMALL camera, especially when compared to my big hefty one, which takes some getting use to. People don't take you seriously as a photographer when you tote around this thing. Also, you cannot attach filters or auxiliary lenses (although a session in Photoshop will usually do the same thing).<br />All in all, I am very pleased. In fact, I'm buying a second camera (exact same) for my partner who keeps \"borrowing\" the camera to take shots while I twiddle my thumbs.<br />By the way --- you might be able to get this camera cheaper through other places on the internet, but be careful. There are a lot of rip off companies out there. With Amazon, you know you'll get the product in a timely fashion and they have excellent customer service if anything goes wrong. I have bought repeatedly through Amazon and have NEVER been dissatisfied.","I must admit that I am biased towards Canon. I have never had a Canon product I did not like. That feeling continues with my Power Shot S30. The one feature which delights me most is the view-finder. Now, that does not sound like much, but for me it is great. My last $800.00 digital marvel did not have a view-finder and the LCD screen was worthless as soon as twilight approached. Even the fact the the Canon's other features are better and easier to use, the view-finder means that I can use all of those features without banging my head against the nearest hard object in frustration. And better and easier those features are, from the 3x optical zoom to the ability to change to shutter priority.<br />If the S30 has the same quality as my four previous Canon printers and my Canon SLR, and I have no doubt that it does, I'll be very, very happy.","I had an s10 for 6 months but it didn't do too well indoors with colors and blurred if the subject was moving. The s30 can handle so many more situations and does it all so much better. I've used the movie feature way more then I thought I would. I've been real happy with it so far.","I was worried about buying a higher mega-pixel camera than the 1.3 mpixel owned previously; fearing the technology would overwhelm me!  Not so with this model.  The auto photo features are perfect for when I don't have time to figure out the manual dials.  Although I would prefer a less cumbersome way of plugging in to an alternative power source, the basic features of this camera are great.  I just printed a 4x6 photo on photo paper with amazing results!  Well worth the money.  This is a sturdy little camera for beginners and photobugs alike.  I will enjoy figuring this one out.  My family is already sick of me snapping shot after shot.  Nicely done, Canon!","This is a very sturdy little camera, the mid-level entry in Canon's \"S\" line. It features great optics and a decent optical & digital zoom combination, as well as awesome 3 megapixel resolution (enlargements of 11\" x 14\" are no problem). If you had to buy one digital camera for all your needs, chances are you'd find the S30 a satisfying choice. It does require a 2nd battery and a larger memory card to be ready to go, but aside from that, it's nearly perfect.","This is one spectacular camera for the novice photographer! When I was looking at digital cameras online, I was stuck between choosing from the S30 or the S330, both from Canon. When I went to a store and physically saw the 2 models, I immediately knew I liked the S30 better. The solid silver color was much shiner than the S330's duller and darker silver color. The S30 also felt much more like a camera when holding it. Overall, I am happy that I chose the S30.<br />It is so easy to use and the zoom can take very detailed pictures. The night time scene is one particular option I would like to point out. I just discovered this, so I'm not sure if this works with other cameras as well. If you switch to the night scene option and you photograph a pitch dark area, the camera is able to make out all the actual colors of the thing you're photographing instead of producing a dark picture. This is great for concerts (of course, there's a very big noticable bright flash), but it might be a drawback if you were really aiming to take pictures of the night time.<br />I give it a 4 stars instead of a 5 because of it's problem with battery and my trouble installing the software. If you plan to use this camera for one whole day, you will most certainly need extra batteries. I used the camera for maybe about 2 hours straight before the battery totally went dead (and I fully charged the batteries before initial use too). I also experienced a little trouble installing the TWAIN drivers that are needed if you want to download the pictures from your camera to your computer. I use Windows 98 and for some odd reason, my the manual's instruction didn't work for me. I had to figure this out some other way to install the drivers.<br />Other those 2 minor points, this camera is spectacular!","This is one spectacular camera for the novice photographer!

I was planning on buying a digital camera for that reason (and others), but I planned to search for a rock bottom price on a entry level camera, being fairly new to digital photography.  Once I saw this one though, I was absolutely blown away.<br />It's very small, like a small 35mm camera, and it's light as a feather, yet it's constructed very solid with a very cool metal exterior.  The resolution is so good that we are not only emailing the pics and saving them on our computer (which pretty much any digital camera can do), but we're ordering high resolution prints of the JPG's that are better than any pics I took with my 35mm camera.<br />It's nothing but digital for me from now on!  This way I take as many pics as I possibly can and don't worry about wasting film or running out.  I'm having a blast editing the pics too, it makes me feel like a real photography expert.<br />I know I've barely scratched the surface of what this camera can do-- I haven't taken movies but I have a digital camcorder so I don't need that feature (although it's nice to have and I'm sure to experiment someday).  Although I couldn't afford to shell out the big bucks to buy a camera this nice for myself, we're so happy to have it.","Well, i just picked this camera up yesterday after returning a Olympus c-3020 that I had bought 2 days prior.<br />The reason I got the Olympus first was I thought I wanted to be able to use AA batteries because of availability and I thought that the rechargable one that came with the Canon would not alow me to take that many pictures before having to recharge the battery. Boy was I mistaken!!!<br />The Olympus only gave me about 30 pictures before i had to replace the batteries. Well after tallying up what batteries were going to set me back ( YIKES ) and visiting Canon's web site to look at the PDF manual to see how long the Lithium-Ion battery lasted (about 150 pics acording to the manual) I imeditately packed up the Olympus at took it back to the store and exchanged it for the Canon S-30.<br />I also picked up a 128 mb CF card at the same time so I can be assured of enough storage to capture everything I might want to take a picture of on vactions, special events etc...<br />I am very happy with the way the camera feels ie. the brushed aluminum case (all metal...no plastic)<br />The picture quality is phenomenal after only a few hours of goofing around with it here at home. I can only imagine what the results will be after i really learn all the little cool things this baby can do.<br />I highly recomend this camera to anyone looking for a mid priced, med-high megapixel camera.","We've had this camera for about a month and a half...I've taken approximately 200 pics with it. Awesome is all I can say...I've been into photography for about 15 years. My film camera I spent $[money] on between body, lenses, and flash (a Nikon N70, 2 zoom lenses and a zoom flash). The Canon S30 takes just as good pictures and its easy enough to use that my wife can also use it.<br />Downloading pics to the computer takes 1 or 2 seconds. I can take  a picture, download and post it to the internet in less than 4 minutes.<br />Quality is outstanding. I love this camera. I still have film in my Nikon from my sons birth that I haven't taken out to get developed yet. And unlike my anal photo way that I am, it doesn't bother me because we have the Canon S30.<br />One other great feature I was able to use while taking pics at the hospital, was the black and white feature. Just turn the dial and take black and white pictures of a mother with her new baby.<br />One last thing: upgrade to a bigger flash card, I found a 128MG card for $[money] and I also purchased a 2nd battery for $[money]. Both at other online stores...The battery doesn't take long to charge, but if your in the middle of photo taking it is nice to have an extra...","Bought this camera a month ago along with a 128MB sandisk.  Really enjoyed it. Both my wife and I are taking many more pictures and in more occasions than before.<br />The focus is very sharp and len is pretty fast.  The picture resolution is just blowing you up.<br />I found Costco has a print service for digital pictures, 20c for each print. So we tends to take 50 or 100 pictures at once and then select a few for print.  You can not tell this is a print from digital camera, except the resolution is astonishing.<br />It takes 30 seconds video clips as well, though somehow the focus is not that great and with low resolution, the video looks<br />pretty fuzzy.<br />Will stay with static picture taking.","\"Excellent choice!\"<br />After lots of shopping around, we finally decided on the S30.. boy! was it a good decision! This camera's got it all.. we bought ours at eCost.com (good online experience at a great price!).. it comes with a 16Mb CF card which is nice, but if you can afford it, get an additional 32 or 64Mb CF card. The 30-sec (max) video clips are also sweet! The resolution is really decent and images quality is fantastic. For the money, this is a great deal!","I recently purchased this camera for my girlfriend. And goodness!! Its an awesome camera.....!!!This is my second digital camera that I have. People said to start off with an okay digital camera first and then see how that is and then if you want in the future...purchase a better one. Bad advice..if you want a digital camera...start off with a great one. And the S30 is a wonderful start.....many great functions, a really cool toy to have. Battery life is good, options are great, nothing bad to say about the S30. A truly awesome camera..I know its a bit expensive to dish out that much..but its worth it.","Spent 2 months deciding on which camera to get, and with the help of amazon's customers reviews made the decision on the S30 over the olympus.  My only hesitation for the Canon was the fact that it didn't take AA batteries.  But I am happy I went with the s30 and the battery has a good life (about 150 pictures I think it said).  Basically I have been taking pictures on \"auto\" since I got the camera, indoor/outdoor all take great pictures.  Very happy with this camera.","This camera is spectacular!  I had no trouble installing it on 2 systems, however I did encounter some small issues when installing the Canon Zoom EX software on a Win98 OS with Twain drivers already installed.  In the end, I got it working without much headache.<br />I received this camera as a gift, and I'm glad I did.  I'm not sure I would have purchased it otherwise, as I was hooked on the Sony Mavica.  For some reason I was sold on the Mavica since you could store images on floppy.  I thought I wouldn't be able to hold enough pics on a Flash card.  Boy was I wrong!  I took well over 50 pics wile at Sea World for the day, at the highest resolution, and my 256 mb card still had memory to spare.  It's well worth getting the 256 mb Flash Memory, but also consider getting an additional battery.  By late afternoon my battery was running low on juice and it alerted me, well before any poor pictures were taken.<br />The clairty and color of the pictures is phenominal.  We took a picture of a sweating soda can when we first hooked it up, and we could see even the finest, smallest sweat bead on the can.  The digital and optical zooms both work extremely well, making it very easy for you to add drama to a picture. The preview screen is so very clear, I had people in the airport looking at pictures over my shoulder in amazement that they were so good. I also liked the weight of the camera.  It was heavy enough to make it feel solid in your hand -- something that I find a lot of the pocket-sized digital cams lack.  Also the sounds it makes when powering on, or even the clicking of the shutter when you take a picture, all serve purpose and are easily identified.<br />All in all it's quick and easy setup has you taking pictures in 10 minutes (after the battery is charged of course).  I found that camera to be intuitive as well -- especially good for those people who refuse to read manuals.","I bought this camera because of all the wonderful consumer and critic reviews. However, if you are someone that travels frequently or is out of the country and want to email pics back to family and friends of places you are visiting, then I suggest looking into an Olympus instead. In order to view your pics or email them or just upload them onto a computer, you need to first install the canon software. This is not practical if you are in a random internet cafe in Europe.<br />The Olympus allows you to upload pics using only the USB cable without having to install software. There is a catch on the Olympus too. You can only upload your pictures without having to upload software if you are using Microsoft XP/ME editions. Really do your research before buying.","...I love that I can go back to fancying myself a photo hobbyist again with the many settings I can manipulate.. but that if I am in a hurry to get a snap, the auto works great.  I love the ability to make short videos to email, and the sound quality, though tinny on the camera of course, is excellent played on the computer or TV.<br />I was also impressed with the speed of this camera, for a digital... mentioned by many folks, which with a 14 year old doing a lot of sports, and two grandsons to catch in action was very important.<br />The first night we got the camera, I was telling my son about how it is supposed to do very well in low light, something my Minolta Vectis S-1 APS camera had great trouble with.  So, being a kid, he did something I never would have thought of doing - he marched into some of our bedrooms at nighttime, shut the doors and blinds, and in the PITCH black, took some pictures.  These babies came out perfect, lit up for all the world as though the room had been bathed in light, super sharp in focus, and my mind was blown....<br />I cannot see what the point of the S40 would be - this thing kicks out such high resolution pictures, and it is faster than the S40.... great price point... with all the little accessories you need to pick up, I did not want to pay more than [money] for the camera.  The Zoom EX browser software for downloading pics to computer works great - the bundled photo editing software was a complete laugh.  It got uninstalled about 10 minutes after I installed it.  Presently working with the Jasc PaintShop Pro 30 day free trial, and am very impressed.  First bunch of pics had quite a bit of red eye (did not use red-eye flash) and I was amazed at how easy it is to fix the eyes in Paintshop.<br />Fantastic camera!","I started using the Canon S100 when it first came out about 2 years ago.. it was the best camera in town... Then came the S110, with more features and better battery life... the best just got better! I gave the S110 to my wife and decided to step-up with a 3.2 MegaPix camera... I bought the Nikon Coolpix 885, and guess what.. I returned it 2 weeks later... because the picture quality was so-so... Then I received the S30.. and believe me.. It's the best digital camera I ever had and have seen... it's great! Same quality as the Digital Elph (s100, s110), great features, and most important, great picture quality.<br />PROS:<br />- Great finish, great style, great overall construction<br />- No plastic or cheap materials<br />- Incredible picture quality in all modes<br />- Super fast image processing<br />- Super fast \"ready for next picture\"<br />- Great LCD display<br />- Great size! (not that small as the S110, but still perfect!)<br />CONS:<br />- Heavy for the size. (this because of the good quality materials used)<br />- The \"navigator\" joystick, is kind of not intuitive to move.<br />- Video mode is not good compared to other less expensive cameras I have seen.<br />- Does not come with a case.","I have owned the S30 for three months and find it easy to use, very good picture quality, sturdy feel, good battery life. Invest in the 128 meg card...you will take lots of pictures.","I purchased the S30 from J&R cat. for... great price!! I had to return it twice for the same problem of a burnt pixel, which according to canon was in the CCD not the LCD!! This was something I could not over look since my prints had a green dot in the middle where the pixel was burnt.  Camera #3 seems to be OK. Otherwise, the camera is simple to use with many fun options (movie mode, B/W pictures, audio).  The prints are impressively film-like (Canon S800 printer). I purchased a NEW 256 mb cf-card...works great...it gives me 154 pictures at the highest resolution!! Works well with its own Canon software, but I found that prints using Adobe LE were blurry...don't know why?!?!? Not a big deal. The bottom line is that it is a good camera, with many features, film-like resolution, good price, good looks, and the Canon name.  BUY A LARGER CF CARD!!!!!!","I had this camera about a week after reviewing the rating and owners comments. I am very happy to have it. I took some pictures in Av mode in door without flash, the picture is still very bright.<br />I noticed that setting the ISO at 800, the resolution is starting to reduce. However,this setting still can be use in the  theater where the flash is not allowed to use.<br />It is also a good tool to teach someone how to take a picture. You can try to take several picture with different settings, then to review them to find out which setting is the best.<br />Highly recommanded.","This is my first digital camera and I am very impressed.  Definately read the manual first, but after that everything is pretty straightforward. The software installed well on my Windows 98SE machine.","I bought this camera about 4 weeks ago and I love it. Exelent pictures, easy to operate, loads of features, and seems to be well built. It has a good weight and feels good in your hands (small fingers help but not necessary). The only complaint I have is the price dropped after I bought it (thats life). This is a very good camera you can't go wrong.","Great camera with complete manual mode.<br />It's always with me, even if it's not as compact as other canon models (e.g. digital elph s300 or s100).<br />Perfect balance between advanced features and price and size<br />Nice deal!<br />Ciao<br />Luca","For months, I researched digital cameras...printed off the specs of at least 30 different models.  My search led me to the Canon Powershot S30 and after owning it for a mere three days, I LOVE IT!<br />One of the \"complaints\" I kept reading about digital cameras in general was the poor quality of indoor pictures (too dark or blurred).  This camera takes BEAUTIFUL indoor pictures!  We *tried* to make it blur and took some action shots. This camera took a perfectly crisp picture of my husband wildy waving his arms!  And, the pics of our young children are perfect every time.  The flash is really amazing.<br />The instruction manual is very well written, very detailed, not confusing at all.  In three days, I have already taken pictures (on AUTO) in every resolution, taken three videos with the movie mode and all this was without reading the manual from cover to cover.  The controls, menus and manual are so easily laid out that you can use the camera without a lot of studying.  Of course, to have more control over my pics, I will need to read more about the manual settings.<br />Oh, the battery life...excellent!  There is not an always-present indicator of battery power; however, when the battery is getting low, a red indicator comes on (so there is some warning).  But, so far, I have used the camera quite a bit with each charge and have had plenty of power.  The charging process is very fast, too.  (less than an hour to get a full charge)<br />The cover for the USB connection seems rather flimsy...but, I download my pics using my Photosmart printer so I don't have to use a USB port.  If I was continually opening and closing the cover, I would be concerned that it might not last.  (?)<br />Compactflash cards...keep in mind, the type this camera uses are available everywhere...they are not \"proprietary\" like some brands (Sony, for instance).  That was a big thing for me...I can buy my cards online from many different sites or go out to Sam's / Wal-Mart.  BTW, the 16 MB card holds so much more than I thought it would!<br />This is my first digital camera, so I am not an experienced user nor do I have anything to compare this camera to.  But, I have to say that I am extremely happy with the quality of the photos and highly recommend this camera!  It is A LOT of camera for the price...the 16 MB card, rechargeable batteries and base...GREAT package!<br />BTW, I bought a Case Logic camera bag at WM on clearance that fits this camera perfectly.","When I selected this camera I knew the written specs, so it's hard to say I was surprised at what it can do, but I was surprised! The photo modes work great and produce outstanding shots, no surprise there.<br />I was annoyed at first that I can't date stamp the images themselves with the camera, but the S30 records the data and time the picture was taken in the meta-data of the JPEG. In addition, there are a dozen more interesting tidbits in that meta-data, like F-stop, shutter speed and the distance from subject. This kind of detail reveals Canon's dedication to the pro-sumer market.<br />The big surprises came in the movie mode, which does a pretty good job, and with the excellent software Canon bundles with the S30. This software really helps me accomplish the creative things I planned when I bought it.","I was looking for a small but sturdy camera that gave me high quality pictures.  On this, the camera does not dissappoint!<br />The one issue that I noticed early on....too many controls to be a out-of-the-box aim-and-shoot camera.  I think a few times with the manual is absolutely necessary.  The Kodak DC4800 that I owned before was truly an aim-and-shoot camera that I hardly needed the manual for.<br />The indoor picture quality is excellent.  The colors are little bit more true on this camera than my dc4800. I have only used the auto setting so far and every picture has been of very good quality.<br />This is a camera for high quality pictures on automatic, indoor setting for a person who does not mind refering to the manual a few times before getting comfortable with the camera. (Most digital cameras do well in the outdoor shots....so, I was looking at this camera for the indoor shots specifically).","...It seemed that most camera's had some type of flaw, but when I stumbled upon the S30/S40, most all of the reviews were extremely positive.<br />So [now] we own one.  It's takes excellent pictures inside and out (to the level of a good quality 35mm point'n'shoot).  The built-in capabilities are robust and easy to utilize and the accompanying software is slick and easy to use.<br />Downside is actually indicitive of all digital cameras, and that is the battery life.  The proprietary Lithium-Ion is a nice battery, easily charged at any time, and good for 500 chargings before incurring a...replacement fee.  But since Canon does NOT include an AC adapter (available), you are forced to rely on their battery more heavily.<br />The use of metal in the body and clam-shell lens cover is something all makers should copy.","I got mine at gateway for $ 419 dollars with free shipping. (coupon) Places like half com and ebay are selling used ones for over $ 500 dollars. Do some research before buying and save a bit of money.","I did my 2 months of research before purchasing this camera a month ago. I wanted a camera that would produce excellent picture quality (3+ megapixel), be easy to carry, easy to use, packed with digital features, and get it for [good price].  I love my Canon S30!  It has met all my expectations.<br />My decision came down to either the Canon S30 or Olympus D-40.  The Olympus is also a very compact camera and had the added feature of 4 megapixel quality at almost the same price.  Why did I choose the Canon over the Olympus?  The manual for the Canon was MUCH more user friendly, and the the Olympus was too small for large hands to conveniently operate.<br />One word of warning.... Verify the return instructions in case of a defect before you buy.  My initial camera did have a defect.  The feature to display photos on a TV would not work.  After trying multiple TV's and rereading instructions, I brought it back to the store where I purchased it.  Sure enough, it would not work in the store either.  But, when my cable worked fine with the display model of the camera, we verified my camera had a defect. The replacement camera has been fine.","Okay, so I don't technically *own* this product (YET!), but I've been doing a lot of research and decided this is the camera for me. I went to BestBuy to take a look at it in person and I was very impressed. It definitely wasn't the fanciest looking camera on the shelf (it looked like a regular point and shoot camera), but a salesman showed me sample images taken from different cameras and the s30 seemed to produce the best pictures in it's class. Upon returning home, I quickly logged on to Amazon.com to purchase this camera. Regarding my purchasing experience, I must admit I had some problems, but the customer service was very good and quick to resolve my complaints. Another word of advice, If you use the \"Super Saver Shipping\" option, it will take quite some time to receive the product.  I ordered this camera on February 17, and I am not expected to receive it until February 28-March 1. Anyway, thank you for all the reviews, as this site helped me tremendously with my decision to purchase this camera.  I am waiting patiently for it's arrival!","This is my second digital camera.  The first was a Sony Mavica, which my husband bought me one Christmas.  I learned from that camera what was important to me:  high resolution, long battery life, an optical viewfinder, and a small size.  This has all of those things and more.  The Mavica writes to a floppy, and the mechanical process severely limits the speed at which you can take pictures and drains the battery rapidly.  There is no way you can get thru a day of being a tourist with it.  We had to buy an inverter for the car to compensate for the battery drain.  The Sony also had no optical viewfinder.  That mean you had to use the LCD, which was terrible in bright sun and also was another battery drainer.  The floppy disk drive also meant that the camera was bulky.<br />This camera is the perfect size, easy to carry, but not so small your fingers feel fat all the time.  The size of the battery pack is great and I bought a second to put in my pocket which means I have no worries for a full day of shooting.  I used this recently at a ski race and the \"motor drive\" was terrific!  It really tracked the athletes well in its focussing ability and produced INCREDIBLE pictures.  I used the \"fine\" setting and the largest picture size and the motor drive was pretty much able to keep up with what I needed in spite of the large file sizes it was writing (around 800k apiece).<br />There are tons of different settings on this camera -- you might want to take a class in photography to get your use out of them!  I took classes and was a serious photographer years ago and needed to draw on that knowledge to understand all the settings.  You really need to read the manual -- I am normally not one to do that, but had to on this thing.<br />I also bought a 256Meg CF card and an adapter so I could just shove the thing into my laptop and deal with the files directly without the Canon software utilities.  This makes it as easy as the floppy disk feature on the Sony.<br />One beef is that the motor drive setting must be re-set every time you close and re-open the lens cover or it will revert to a single shot mode.  This was a pain on a snowy day as I was closing the cover frequently and each time had to select the motor drive feature again.  Also, if the digital zoom is not turned off and you are using the optical viewfinder, you will not be aware that you have zoomed in closer than you can tell.  I got a view skier-derriere shots by accident this way.","Great ergonomics, wonderful image quality and lots of control - a loveable camera!<br />After lusting after a digital Ixus at a party I upgraded from the Fuji Finepix 2800 I bought recently to the Canon Powershot S30, which at the moment is well-priced compared with the S40 (the 4 mpixel model) and the other 4 MP models. Reviews suggest image quality of the S40 is a fair bit better than the comparable compacts around like the Olympus C-40Z and the Pentax Optio 430 models.<br />I am delighted with the camera. The images are clear and sharp and colours are deep and beautifully natural. The number of modes give you almost full control over things like aperture priority, time priority, and ISO from 50 to 800, which gives you fantastic flexibility, as well as Canon's photostitch mode which lets you make panoramas easily with the supplied software. All this is readily accessible with all buttons easy to use (except the rocker selector which can be fiddly). It is comfortable and can fit into a coat pocket reasonably comfortably, unlike the bulky and unergonomic Fuji, while being strong (metal body). Despite a couple of weak points this is a great camera that I've basically fallen in love with already.<br />A couple of minor drawbacks as follows: 1. noise in very long exposure shots (night photos) 2. my camera has a dead pixel in the LCD screen 3. the visual viewfinder only gives you 85% of the shot 4. the viewfinder is not electronic 5. rocker menu selector fiddly to use.","After spending a couple weeks researching & reviewing digital cameras, I was interested in the Canon G2 but didn't care for the price on something that becomes obsolete faster than computers!  Liked the digital Elph but not enough features.  The S30 looked like the right one for my first digital camera.  I'm totally impressed with all the functions which many cameras don't have.  The LED screen is bright and clear and takes great pictures in low light conditions, indoor or outdoor.  Canon's printed manual is very easy to read.  Ended up buying an extra battery & 256mb card.  No problems with running low on either yet and if you want to save the battery, you can turn off the LED & sound functions.  You can manually operate the flash too.  Forget about buying Canon's camera bag.  I ended up getting a different bag that was advertized and Canon's manual even states that bags do vary depending on location.  When you slide the camera into the bag, it's so tight that it opens up the front lens cover.  Threw it into the trash and ordered a Case Logic.  Canon's software package is very useful but I find using Microsoft's PhotoDraw 2000 much easier to use for web editing.  I highly recommend this camera and I'm pleased with every detail.  Buy it and you won't regret it.  I know if I would have chosen one of the other brands, I'd still be thinking if I made the right decision over the S30!","This is my second camera so far.  I recently bought an Olympus C3020 and realized after a few days that I really felt ripped off for the money I spent.  I returned it and got the Canon S30 after doing some more thorough research on reviews of cameras.<br />So far I like everything about this camera.  The metal case, shape and weight feel good in your hands.<br />Not having to deal with a lense cap is another big plus.<br />the videos are short and lo-res, but for me it's an opportunity to at least get SOME stuff of my kids on video before they grow up.  Certainly getting a digital camcorder is on my wishlist, but personally until I can get an hour of good quality video at a reasonable price, I'm not ready to spend the money.<br />The battery is GREAT and the fact that it came with both the rechargable battery and the charger was a big plus.  When I was looking at cameras, I really liked the Nikon 885, but when I discovered they sold the camera with a disposable lithium battery(excuse me, disposable??) and no charger, I just could not accept that.  I'm sorry, if I'm spending 500-600 dollars, don't poor-boy me.  I've found that a lot of the cameras in the field out there all have one or more \"gotchas\" like the Nikon did that unless you really look over the specs, it's easy to miss.  The canon does not have any \"gotchas\" that I have found.  Aside from a larger storage card, you really don't need to buy anything else to enjoy this camera.<br />The battery so far seems to have a very long lifespan.  I've been using mine throughout the day and charge it overnight.  I've not run out of juice yet, and I always have the screen on when I use it.<br />There is only one minor things I found about this camera, I wish were included and that is a battery meter so I would know when the battery is getting low.<br />Overall, my advice is if you looking for a 3.x MP camera you really need to look at either this camera or a sony (which I considered, but did not like the higher cost of media and card readers since I don't own a sony laptop :(","What more can I say? I got the S30 after doing much research. Canon has done it again. I loked at the S300, but the S30 was more muscle. It rivals my best $2500 SLR camera. I am an old shutterbug from the old school so I was sceptical of a high end digital camera that can carry it's own weight.  If you shoot alot, have plenty of hard drive space on your PC.<br /><br />The camera takes fantastic shots.I had a 20 x 30 photo printed with near perfection. The Auto mode is true point and click, so those who are afraid of a high learning curve, forget it. There are so many features in this camera. I love the Sepia and B&W setting. It has settings galore. Cloudy weather, Sunlight, Incandescent, etc..... a true marvel of a camera. A nifty feature is the ability to add custom sounds, such as .wav files to the camera to customize each sound it makes. You can even download an image that the camera will display when it turns on.<br />The camera is a bit heavy, but I like that. It reminds you you are carrying a REAL camera, not a disposable toy. It fits in the jeans pocket just perfect. I had to turn down the flash quite a bit. It is a pretty powerful flash. I got sick of my Sony Mavica and it's notoriously horrible low light photo's.<br /><br />The software that comes with it is adequate. Nothing all that great, as with most bundled software. Novices will enjoy the features.<br />The battery life is short and the memory card is small (16mb), but that is common with every manufacturer. Get a 128mb or 256mb if you want to have plenty of room. The movie mode is pretty cool too. the AVIs are clear, not like MPEG's.<br />GET THIS CAMERA! You will not be dissapointed.","I recently purchased the Canon S30 and have been more than happy with. Although a bit pricey, it is definetly the best buy of all the cameras in its class. The camera has loads of features, some of which I am still figuring out. Although it can be used as a fully manual camera, it works excellent as a automatic camera as well. The coolest features this camera has that many lack is the sitch mode. This mode allows the user to take panoramic pictures and an included program makes it easy to put it all together. Another great feature this camera has is the burst mode which takes multiple shots continuously. Great for action shots. Besides the numerous features the camera comes with, the camera takes amazing pictures! The details and colors it captures is top-notch. The LCD is also a little bigger than other cameras its size and works great in all lighting conditions. I have done extensive research on Digital Cameras and this came out to be the best in the 3 megapixel class.","OK...I had a Digital Elph, which I loved, until it fell out of my pocket on a ski lift. :|  The S30 outperforms it hands down in every category except size.  A few of the things that weren't toally obvious to me from the advertising:  You can do manual focus with this guy.  Also has a Macro mode.  You have complete apture priority, shutter priority, manual, or several program modes to choose from.  1/1500th shutter on the fast side, ability to pick emulated ISO from 50 up to 800(if I remember right).  Raipd fire shutter mode is cool, I haven't seen this on a digital camera before.  Basically it snaps off about 3 shots/sec until the camera's buffer is full, then it starts writing to the CF.<br />The 16MB CF card is a joke..c'mon Canon...you're giving me a camera that I can take 14-16 shots with?  Get real.  I agree with everybody else saying you need extra batteries.  Only other thing I'm still getting used to is this selective focus area - Canon's had this on their film cameras for a few years, but I've been a Minolta guy for years.<br />Overall, due to the creative control this thing lets me have, I'm considering shelfing my film based gear for a while.  The only thing this camera is missing for me right now is interchangable lenses(I'd love to go wider than it lets me).<br />Great camera.  I'd highly recommend for the intermediate+ photographer.  For a beginner it will work great, just the extra features might be a little overkill.","I've always seemed to have good luck with Canon products so when I decided to dive into digital photography, my short list of manufacturers included Canon.  I liked the compact design of the S30 and the features for the price over others I was considering, so I went with it in the end.  Now that I've had amonth to fiddle with it I have to admit that it exceeds my expectations in almost every way.  The camera is very easy to use and the photo quality is better and more consistent than any automatic 35MM I've ever used.  The software included is also intuitive with features and easy editing capabilities that make it a snap to enhance a less than perfect shot.  When I print the photos I like, the clarity is exceptional even though I am only using an inexpensive HP932C printer.  Crop a shot and put it on glossy photo paper and a routine snapshot becomes an incredibly clear photograph.  I am really enjoying this camera.<br />There are some drawbacks to digital photography.  Some are more universal than others, and most are about cost.  The camera isn't especially cheap to begin with and you need at least a 64MB card to get a reasonable number of shots.  The other additional cost is the extra battery which you should have handy when the one you're using goes dead.<br />If you're thinking about a digital camera and you've done a little homework, you probably already know that it won't be a cheap hobby.  So, cost aside and considering the ease of use as well as the quality of the photos, the Canon S30 is an excellent product that I feel provdes more than it advertises.","Although I am still experimenting with this camera, I am enjoying the flexibility of it.  The design also makes it very easy to use.  The manual is organized well with easy to use instructions.  It is a good camera for a beginner or an intermediate photographer.","This is my first \"true\" digital camera. I have a basic one included on my VHS-C panasonic camocorder, but that is nothing compared to this Canon unit. I was initially attracted by the metal look, solid feel, size, and when I looked at the feature set, said wow! Have not been dissapointed. You will love the features (many pre-set modes and full manual control for the photo-buff), excellent photo quality, and it looks so cool :). Something you will want to buy: a larger CF card, it comes with a 16MB but you will outgrow that after about 7 shots at the highest resolution. Excellent camera, enjoy!","I just recently bought the S30, and so far, I've found it to be nothing but fantastic. Here's what I like about it most:<br />First of all, the 3MP resolution is nice. I'm sure that 3 megapixels will be ... cheaper in another year, but for the moment, this is one of the cheapest cameras that offers so high a resolution.<br />Second, the LCD screen is 1.8 inches, not the 1.5 on smaller cameras.<br />Third, it's small enough to take with you, and the retractable cover on the front ensures safety when carried around.<br />Fourth, an *okay* optical zoom that's great for a camera of its size.<br />Fifth - and this is fairly important - it offers both full auto and full manual control. For me, as an aspring and beginning digital photographer, being able to choose between letting the camera do it's thing or being able to play around with all the exposure settings myself was really nice.<br />Sixth - a 16MB card. Thank you.<br />Seventh - fairly good software bundle. As a mac user, there are definitely better software packages out there, but you can get by right out of the box.<br />Eighth, complete documentation.<br />I'm still experimenting with taking my first photographs, so I'm reserving final judgement until after having used it for a while.","This is my first digital camera and I am so happy with it.<br />This is what you get...<br />A heavier weight than most digital cameras.  I wanted to know that I was holding a camera, not a plastic toy.<br />Nice, easy to use software.  The stitch assist software that comes with the camera is fantastic!!<br />The ability to take mini movies (if a little small and short)  The microphone picks up the ambient sound pretty well.<br />Multiple choices of picture resolution, but why not use the max resolution if you have the memory (see below).<br />Fully automatic to fully manual settings, so you you can practice your photography without wasting expensive film.<br />Uses standard compact flash memory (no expensive proprietary memory or limited to 128MB)<br />This camera will pay for itself (in terms of saving money on picture development) in about a year.<br />A LOT of fun using it and recording some great memories!<br />Using it...<br />I took about 400 shots over two days at Sea World at various resolutions.  The high speed picture mode captured the action perfectly under many different light conditions.<br />It's great for taking long exposure shots (use a tripod).<br />The 3x zoom doesn't sound a lot but really helps to get better pictures at lower resolutions.<br />The stitch mode on the camera really helps you line up the next shot for panoramas and completely takes the guess work out of it.<br />The flash seems pretty strong (much better than my old standard compact camera)<br />Downsides<br />It really drains the battery.  I went through three in one day.  Which is why I recommend getting two more when you purchase (if you can afford it)<br />The cover for the USB port on the camera looks a little flimsy, so I wouldn't use it too much<br />What I would recommend.<br />128MB, or 256MB memory cards<br />At least three batteries<br />A dedicated card reader for the PC","I searched, compared, and waited for the technology to be put in a small compact package.  This camera has a lot of excellent automatic and manual features for taking great night and day photos with excellent color.  It also has a 30 second movie option with sound that is a lot of fun.  I like the fact that I can plug right into the television to view photos and movie clips.  The software is also nice.  I would recommend buying an extra battery and much larger compact flash card.","I was going to buy the s110 but it was all sold out! Oh no! Well sitting right next to it was this little jem. Ok so its a little bigger than the s110 but its got MORE...<br />3.2MP with a RAW file output.<br />TOTAL control of image quality.<br />3 settings for JPEG comression.<br />4 Resolution settings from 640*480 to 2048*1537 JPEG<br />Photo Stich Feature (makes panoramas easy as pie)<br />Nifty sliding cover acts as lens and on/off<br />Fast refresh for taking may pictures in a row!<br />4in Macro<br />Of course theres lots more.<br />Pro: Aluminium case<br />Con: heavy conpared to the plastic bodied ones<br />Pro: rechargable battery<br />etc... go play with it at your local electronics store.","This is my first digital camera and so far has been exactly what I was hoping for. After looking around a lot, I bought this because it had more features than the smaller Canon Elph's; was smaller than the comparable Olympus models, and seemed to have a higher quality construction overall than the Nikons (note: I am not an expert, just observing). Positive surprises -- really quite easy to use; great quality build and \"feel.\" Also -- after getting used to the fact that you have to leave home w/charged batteries, and after buying a 128MB flash memory card, I find the capacity of the camera sufficient for all normal uses.<br /><br />I have been playing both with printing out photos on an HP Photosmart 1215 printer and w/using the Ofoto software that comes w/the camera. Both are fun -- the Photosmart printer is great to pop out a quick set of photos from a day's outing, and the Ofoto service is quite convenient. They both add a new dimension to fun photography.","I have had the this camera for 2 weeks and have been very pleased.  I also own an Olympus digital.  There is no comparison in the ease of use, the ease of the software, and the simplicity of the menu functions of the Canon over the Olympus.  Olympus is still a good camera, but the large step up to the Canon just shows how good a camera this is.  I am very happy.","I was in the market for a compact digital camera, was looking at the elph or the kyrocera.  The picture quality was not there.  I read about the pending release of the s30 and s40, with comprable quality to the G2 but at a smaller size.  The image quality is definatly there, a little soft in the corners.  The camera also allows manual control of the pictures.<br />One small problem is the lcd screen on the back, does not have the standard anti-reflecting coating other canon's have, but i can live with that","I'm brand new to digital cameras and did a ton of research before buying this camera.  With all of the functions I was worried that it would be tough to learn how to use.  All of the functions are really intuitive and it takes great pictures.  Get additional memory and battery or you'll run out of both very quickly.  Heard other people had problems with the software but it worked the first time for me on Windows98.","We bought this camera about 2 weeks ago, and it was easy to set up and use. We were up and running in less than 15 minutes (using the more advanced features in under an hour...(Though make sure you read the directions before you start the set up process, the manual is pretty confusing and out of order somewhat.)<br />IMAGES<br />The photo quality is fantastic. This is the second digital camera we have owned, and the difference between the Kodak DC210 and this is amazing. We did a lot of research before selecting this camera and I am pleased with the choice.<br />And it has video! You can shoot short films 30seconds to 2 minutes. This is really a fun option, and you can string several short clips together using the software that accompanies this to make your own self-contained movie. Definitely a cool feature.<br />point and shoot plus<br />My husband and I have different shooting styles, he's more of a point and shooter, and I like to have some flexibility to to try somewhat more advanced techniques. This camera takes great photos on automatic, but is flexible so I can set the settings as I need to, which is great. It's a mix for the novice and the advanced beginner, (and I hear for the intermediate level photographer as well, but I can't speak to that.)<br />Caveats...<br />Batteries and memory. You will need to buy more memory (compact flash which is better than the memory stick options out there.) we found a 256 memory card for $90, so it's possible to upgrade for not that much money. Batteries drain really quickly when you use the camera on review. We also just ordered a second battery, and I hope that will help.<br />(...) All in all a great camera, and we highly recommend it! Good luck!","After a month of research I decided on the S30.  I couldn't be happier.  I would have sought after the S20 if the blue tint wasn't such a well-documented showstopper (the pictures are some of the sharpest I've seen in this class. The S30 is a bit larger than the elphs, but the sturdiness works.  The lens cover is a great feature, the LCD is good, the download time is fast, the boot up-to-shoot time is fast.  And the pictures are gorgeous - not an artifact in view.  This is a great camera, I highly recommend its consideration.","The Powershot S30 is an easily transportable digital camera that goes far beyond the norm for \"point and shoot\" cameras that it competes against in size and price.  It features a 3.34 megapixel CCD, a 3 x optical zoom, and 3.3x digital zoom, making it comparable to a number of competing products.  What sets this camera apart for the serious photographer is the ability to control exposure, focus, and macro modes in addition to the standard full auto modes.  While slightly larger than the Pentax Optio 300 (a close competitor in price and basic features), it has both full automatic and manual modes, as well as apereture priority and shutter priority modes and 7 preset adjustment settings.  You can use both manual and autofocus, and with autofocus can specify the default averaging focus mode or select an area of the viewfinder to use to focus on an off-center object.  It is possible to automatically bracket pictures to prevent missing the \"perfect shot\".  A virtual \"motor drive\" mode allows taking several pictures in sequence.  A full macro mode allows focusing as close as 0.3 meters.  For those interested, it is possible to record movies with sound (in contrast to the Pentax Optio, which cannot record with sound).  There is also an excellent software package, and included lithium ion battery with rapid (80 minute) charger.  All told, the S30 represents a major breakthrough in low cost, high feature digital cameras that should appeal to the serious photographer.","I have had the camera for one week.  It is easy to use, fairly intuitive and takes great pictures. My problem is the horrendous software manual that accompanies the camera.  We have spent more than 8 hours reading and re-reading the manual, installing and uninstalling software but have been unable to get the camera to communicate to my Windows98 Compaq PC.","I have been playing around with my Powershot S30 for a couple of weeks now, and I must say I am very impressed.  This is my first digital camera.  35mm photography has been a hobby of mine for over 10 years now, so I wanted to get a digicam that wouldn't let me down.  And the S30 hasn't.  It has almost all the features of my Canon Rebel 2000 (except interchangeable lenses, filters, and a hotshoe), but with a fraction of the size.  The pictures are great.  I have noticed that indoor flash pics tended to be a little too bright, but that was easily fixed by adjusting the flash exposure compensation down by 1/3 or 2/3.  The camera takes pictures quickly (not as fast as my SLR, but that's to be expected) and the pics are of high quality.  The battery life is relatively short, but a fully charged battery was more than enough to get me through over 100 shots, using the LCD screen for all of them, the flash for most, and spending a fair bit of time reviewing the photos.  I *love* the fact that the camera records all the settings you used along with the shot.<br />The camera is small and rugged, so it can easily be taken everywhere.  Even the battery charger is fairly small.  I definitely recommend getting a 256MB card (check out newegg.com) and a USB reader.  At highest resolution and least compression, I can fit 157 pics on the 256MB card.  The only thing I've used the 16MB card that comes with the camera for was to transfer some pics to it so a friend who wanted \"doubles\" could go to Ritz camera and print them out for herself.  Definitely recommend!!!!!!!","I picked this camera up a few days ago after doing pretty extensive research online and talking to some people on bulletin boards. I wanted 3mp camera in as compact form as possible that used CF cards and had a rechargeable battery. Then I discovered Canon's new S30/S40. No doubt the S40 is a great successor to the S30, but I have no need for 4mp. I've only had the camera a few days and I'm already very content with my decision.<br /> It has a build quality like no other camera I've held. I'd say it has a 95% metal casing, only the battery door is plastic, and they mesh perfectly with the design. The sliding lens cover is great. Works flawlessly as a on/off switch and protection for the lens. Gives the camera a great smooth finish too. The LCD is bright and has good visibility in sun light. The buttons are well placed and easy to work with. My only minor complaint is the rubber door covering the usb and power jack. I question it's durability after long term use, but it should be ok.<br />So how do the pictures looks? Fantastic. If I could sum it up in 3 words, I would say: Sharp, bright and clear. The flash is powerful enough to take great low-light/night shots. Just don't get to far away :) Battery life is average. One of the drawbacks to such a small camera, but the battery recharges fairly quickly. Keep the LCD off for mucher greater battery life! Oh, and get a large CF card. The 16mb that is included won't cut.<br />No problems using the camera with Windows XP Pro through my monitor's USB hub. Canon's software is kind of bloated, but functional. If you prefer, just use XP's built in Digital Camera support.<br />Overall, excellent camera for people who want something portable (like the S110, although not quite as small), and a 3 megapixel resolution."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S40","amazon_reviews":["My second of this model... Works like a charm...","I actually own the SD30 which is the 3.2MP which is our very first DC. I got it for the birth of my daughter and has captured all her milestones but sadly after 3 1/2 years the sliding cover for the lens gave out and the lens is  stuck and so the camera would not operate anymore. The cost of having it repaired in a Canon service center in IL is as much as buying a new one so I am just looking to buying a newer model (still a Canon of course) Canon has proven a name in the world of photography by the quality of pictures you to take with their camera.","I like the fact that the camera uses compact flash.  The compact flash cards come in sizes up to 4G so that is nice.<br /><br />Easy to use.","This is a great camera for anyone looking for advanced features at a compact size.  Unlike Canon's \"lower-end\" models, the S40/45/50 series pack in all the adjustable/tweakable features seen in most \"SLR\" cameras at a lower cost.  This camera is not as compact as some of Canon's and some of the other manufacturer's units.  But the additional features offered by these cameras outweight the size/weight penalty.<br />My only complaint with these cameras are their less than desirable lenses.  The S40 has a 3x optical zoom (11x digital) and doesn't have the lens power of some of the other Olympus cameras.  Then again, if you're looking for that type of lens capability, you're not looking at these cameras and are more apt to looking at the higher-end SLR versions.<br />Overall, these cameras have the Canon photo quality and the construction quality.  A great buy!","...this is a good camera to start with.  Especially if you use a Mac because it works great with iPhoto.  If youre a beginner like me, you may be overwhelmed by the amount of features the S40 offers, but dont worry.  Just put it on automatic and you will be able to take great pictures.  It just takes a little practice to get used to the delayed response shutter button.<br />Some of the things I like about it:<br />1.  It takes very nice pictures.  Your pictures will look as good as anyones.<br />2.  It has a movie mode that I didnt know existed until recently.  Saves the movie (with sound) in AVI format (QuickTime player will play it)<br />3.  Attractive small body (and who doesnt like attractive small bodies?)<br />4.  The LCD display is great for reviewing your pictures<br />5.  It takes gigantic pictures.  At 100% they are about 20\" tall by 30\" wide.  You probably wont ever print out anything this large, but this just means you have a lot of detail and resolution wont be a problem.<br />What I dont like as much:<br />1.  Too many manual settings keeps me from experimenting too much.  You would have to read the manual if you want to do any shooting besides automatic.  And who wants to read a manual?<br />2.  You have to get pretty close to your subject.  Taking group pictures from much further than 10'-15' will not turn out very good.  If you can get up close you will have great pictures.  Dont try to use this camera at a football game from the stands.  I just dont think it has enough zoom power.<br />Ive enjoyed using mine for the last year and a half.  Like the reviewers before me, I recommend doing the following:<br />1.  Get an extra battery cause you never know when the battery will run out of juice.  It will cost $25-$50 depending on what brand you get.<br />2.  Im not sure what size compact flash card comes with the camera, but its probably in the 16MB range which is pretty much useless.  Being a 4.0 Megapixel camera, and shooting such a large picture, it eats up memory.  Get a couple of 128MB's or even larger if you can and you will have room to take 100 or so pictures.<br />3.  I dont think it comes with Photoshop Elements, but if you can afford it, get it.  If you do cropping and getting photos web-ready you will want to have this or the full Photoshop package (you better be very good if you want Santa to bring this)<br />You will like this camera and all your friends will tell  you that you take great pictures.","The Canon PowerShot S40 was a terrific small digital camera when it was introduced, but the digital camera market advances quickly and this model has been surpassed by Canon's own S45 (an updated S40) and the new S50 (5 megapixel in the same body only in high-tech black). Serious photographers seekng a digital would turn to Canon's EOS Digital Rebel. The S30 and S40 are good cameras if you want lots of features in a small package without paying a lot of money.<br />Features begin with the generous maximum 4 megapixel image size (you can make them smaller to conserve space on the CompactFlash card). Several modes are available to you such as Sports (high shutter-speed and high resolution shots), Portrait, Night, etc. You can put it in complete Idiot Mode (okay, Automatic mode) and let it select your shutter speed and aperture, or you can pick one or the other and let the camera pick the missing one, or you can go full into Manual mode and pick both. There's even a Movie mode, complete with sound. These video clips are 320 x 200 pixels.<br />This small camera fits in a purse or shirt pocket easily and won't get in the way if you're shouldering it in a case (not included, just buy a generic).  But you pay a price for the small size: the optical zoom is limited to 3x.  And unfortuately, the S40, like all the PowerShot S family, starts out with a focal length of 11mm, which is a very wide-angle view. Even at 3X optical zoom you will max out at 55mm, often not as close as you'd need.  There is a digital zoom, but so what?  Crop your picture in software later rather than play with that silly feature.  I found 55mm insufficient for shooting across a large room.  If you work closer in this won't be a problem, but it is not a good focal length for shooting children, who stop whatever adorable thing they're doing when they notice you framing that shot.  (And see comment on slow shutter response, below.)<br />The sliding door that covers the lens (and turns on the camera) seems flimsy and can cause problems. My 3YO niece got ahold of my S40 and ripped the door off. I was able to reattach it but now it's a loose tooth, ready to fall off again. Even under warranty, my choice was to send it back to Canon for 12 weeks or live with it. I couldn't live without the camera, so I kept it, loose sliding door and all. I've just learned not to lend it to people who can't baby it; a good push and that door is off the camera again.<br />One of the S40's most frustrating limitations is a slow shutter response.  I can't tell you how many shots I've missed using it; I frame it lovingly, I see the perfect moment, I shoot... but no score. The people have moved on, the sun has set, the universe suffers heat-death, and finally the shutter clicks.  If you want a fast shutter then you must have a digital SLR, as almost all the compact-style digital cameras such as this one have the delayed shutter issue.  Another note of annoyance on the PowerShot S family: they come with a wrist strap but no shoulder strap. I don't know what use a wrist strip is for a camera; if I'm not using it then I want my hands free.  I bought a generic shoulder strap but it wasn't a great fit.  At least Canon should offer one as an extra-cost accessory.<br />One difference between the S30 and S40 is the latter only allows an ISO of 400 which restricts low-light photography.  This is a limitation of the larger CCD in the S40.  ISO 800 shots on the S30 are quity noisy so it isn't clear you are missing this feature in the S40, and you gain an extra megapixel.<br />I still give this camera 4 stars for putting so many features in such a small package. The pictures are reasonably good, and at this size you can crop plenty out and still print good 4x6 inch images. The PowerShot S40 comes with software, but you'll probably want to buy your own image editing package, such as Photoshop Elements. The one provided is fairly limited. Useful software includes PhotoStitch, which allows you to make your own panaramic style images from a series of linked shots. The included 32 MB CompactFlash card is also too small for typical use, so plan on buying a bigger card.  Also plan on buying a second battery.","I love this camera.

Microdrives draw a lot of power, so if you use one in the S40 expect battery life to drop by at least 60%.  Also remember microdrives use moving parts (heads and platters) so you absolutely don't want to drop it.  Prices on 512MB CF cards are dropping and 1GB cards are coming, and you can take a lot of picture with them, so microdrives may not be a good investment.","When I was in the camera store I said that I really like the metal bodied cameras and the sales guy said that actually they come in more often for repairs because plastic is more forgiving when you drop it - and yes, I found this out the hard way.  I dropped it and the camera's outer body bent exposing a little bit of the guts - but it still works!<br /><br />Takes great photos and has held up for several years with no major glitches (oh, except once a flash card got erased when i opened the battery cover while it was reading off it - don't do that - it says not to do that in the instructions).","A couple of years ago I developed a passion for making costume jewelry. I got my own website, and started to sell the things I made. But a business like this stands or falls with the quality of the pictures of the creations that you display on the website.<br />When I started searching for a digital camera, I looked at the most important features, and 'micro photography' was # 1, with 'easy handling and downloading' as a very close runner up.<br />This camera is the best thing since sliced bread. The quality of the pictures is AMAZING, it is EASY to use, small and light in weight.<br />The operating mechanisms are clear and easy accessible. It has many features and options that make it FUN and challenging, but it remains easy enough to not get confused.<br />The software that comes with the camera is very user-friendly and allows you to adjust the pictures, so that they load faster for use on the web.<br />It certainly was not the cheapest camera available. But I have never been sorry that I decided to spend the $$$. Every time I use it, I am happier than a pig in the poop.<br />I wanted and DID get the best camera there is.<br />Mildred, MilliJoolz on the [...]","I got this camera about seven months ago, and I've been very pleased with it.  However, there are a couple of extras that are important to have in order to make it usable:<br />1 - The included memory card is a bad joke.  Plan on buying at least a 128, more likely a 256.  You'll need it.  (I bought a 128 at the same time that I got the camera, and I've found that it's not enough.  The 256 that I picked up a few months later seems about right.)<br />2 - BUY AN EXTRA BATTERY, and carry it with you.  My single complaint with this camera is the expensive proprietary battery.  Expensive as it is, though, an extra battery is indispensable if you're going to use the camera much.<br />3 - Particularly for low-light shots and no-flash shots, get a tripod.  (That's going to be my next purchase.)  My hands are good and steady, but not steady enough for this camera.","After tons of research into prices and megapixels, I decided I wanted a 4 MP camera even though most people never seem to need more than 3. My brother's Elph works beautifully at 2 MP.<br />I chose the Canon S40 for the price to functionality and after three months I still think it was a good choice. Since my price range for all the accessories was $...I couldn't go for the Canon G2.<br />I had to choose between the G2's fantastic functionality that still wouldn't match my Pentax 35mm with beautiful lenses...and a smaller camera that I would actually use. I was tired of dragging my Pentax with its many lenses and flash around - I needed a smaller camera. The Canon Elph would have been my choice, except the smaller the camera the more it costs to get the same functionality.<br />Now to the end result - Apart from the not-so wonderful flash distance, the Canon S40 takes beautiful pictures. Took daylight shots of the Grand Canyon, night shots of Las Vegas and some family pictures inside. Daylight shots were dreamy, family pictures with flash at close range were good. Distant shots in a badly lit room - not good at all. Distant shots at night required a steady hand and a change to the night setting. I had no issues with the camera - I have a steady hand! However, the second someone without experience tried to take photographs at night, there was a lot of shake.<br />Bought a 256 MB Viking CF card (also from Amazon) and an extra battery. Both were necessary - the highest quality jpegs eat up memory and I had enough to take a week's worth of vacation shots.<br />Don't forget to format your CF card before use - had some memory errors when trying to download.<br />I don't enjoy the downloading process for 250 photographs - try and do it every 30 or so photographs and format the card before you start again. I think I'll be buying the AC Adaptor as soon as I'm feeling flush with money again... it's a pain to have to worry about whether the battery will die on you while you download.","I have never even used a digital camera before I bought this one and started using it. It is very friendly. The pictures are great and the software is usefull but redundent if you have a picture program in your computer. This is a very flexible camera. A real good buy.","Bad Side:<br />1. the selection and confirmation button is a big drawback. it is hard to press \"ok\" without mistake.<br />2. the user's manual is unclear and badly organized.<br />3. too slippery, if add some rubber handle like other cameras would be much better.<br />4. lens'cover is a little bit loose.<br />5. too sensative to slight shaking<br />Good Side:<br />1. after all, it is a very good camera at the medium level and above.<br />2. it has almost all the functions you may desire.<br />3. picture quality perfect at very large size.<br />4. small and portable.<br />5. LCD displays very well and clear (noticeably better than 3M cameras like Kodak 4330)<br />6. self-contained image processing functions<br />7. easy to instantly discard unwanted pictures<br />8. process very quickly<br />Overall, the best one if you want to pay less than 500 for a<br />picture","I have owned this camera now for about 4 months and it is one of the best purchases I have made in the last few years. The pictures produced by the S40 are great, and color reproduction is on right on target.<br />Why I bought the S40 over the G2?<br />The main reason I bought the S40 instead of the G2, another great camera, is portability and size. I find the S40's smaller size more convenient and I am more likely to bring it when I go out, and thus more likely to use it. I also liked the S40's feel and look. It is a sturdy camera and well built, which is important if you tend to be rough on things as I am.<br />What's good, what's not?<br />It is hard to complain about the S40. Pictures come out colorful and sharp. The S40 also has so many options for a point in shoot, including manual settings and aperture and shutter control.  It also has a movie mode and while it is not a replacement for a video camera, I found that taking a couple 30 second movies at events in addition to pictures really improves your memory of the event/party/whatever. The S40 also has amazing resolution for a point and shoot... You can pretty much make prints as large as you want. At 8 x 10, this camera produces pictures indistinguishable from film, and can probably produce much larger prints with the same quality, although I haven't tried myself. Also the battery, though proprietary, has good stamina, however you should get at least one additional backup battery. Last this camera has an unbelievable flash. My wife is actually scared sometimes to have pictures taken of her at night because the flash is so strong. Flash is very important to digital cameras in general where low light tends to be an Achilles heel.<br />Like most digital cameras, there are a few places where there is room for improvement. The two biggest problems with the S40 that I have found, neither of which should steer you from this camera, are the controller and the AF. The controller is a little awkward to use in selecting. The button is hard to push in while not accidentally pushing up down left or right. The other area for improvement is the Auto Focus. At times the camera has trouble focusing on the subject. This only happens occasionally, but can be frustrating when you got a good picture that comes out blurry (You can't tell it's blurry on the LCD). This seems to be something that occurs throughout the canon line of cameras, even the high end digital SLR's, and many digital cameras have some focus problems, especially in low light, but canons focus light usually takes care of the problem.<br />Picture quality<br />I have read some reviews on here that say the resolution is the same as there 2 MP camera, don't believe it. Anyone who says the resolution on this camera is poor probably doesn't know anything about digital photography. For example, most digital cameras base there photo quality on resolution, which is the size of the digital photo. If you zoom two pictures, one a 4 MP and one a 2 MP to 200% they both may look equally pixilated. This is because when you zoom in on a picture you are comparing pixels per inch more then resolution, and in many cases the pixels per inch can be the same on a 4MP as in a 2MP. (Most lower end cameras capture at 72 pixels per inch (but can be higher), the S40 captures at 180 pixels per inch on the highest setting). So, total quality of the picture is the pixels per inch and the number of inches you have. Also, it doesn't help that the software Canon provides with the camera reduces the resolution for viewing in the program (At least that's my impression). Some graphics software does this to make layout with pictures easier, requiring less computer power, because you are not moving the full resolution version of the picture around (Quark, a popular layout program for designers does the same thing, however there should be no loss the picture quality when you actually go to print).<br />To really appreciate the picture quality you should use a program like Adobe Photoshop. Also, when you print a picture out, especially an 8x10 or larger, you should first change the pixels per inch to a higher level. I usually up the pixels per inch in Photoshop to 1000 and then adjust the document size to the desired size. You don't add any information this way, but I found it helps the printer create sharper better quality prints. Also make sure you properly setup you printer to print best quality on photo paper, highest res and slow to maximize quality.<br />Conclusion<br />This camera is a great buy and promises to make a great replacement for your point in shoot film camera. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone and have yet to find another camera that I believe is better for a mid range consumer camera, except maybe the G2, which is slightly better but bulkier 12/12/02. Also, with 4MP, this camera is unlikely to become obsolete anytime soon, as you would need to get a 16MP camera to double the resolution of this camera. (You need 4 times the MP to double resolution. I.e. a 4MP is double the res of a 1 MP and 50% better then a 2MP)","After having a great experience with the Canon A20 I decided to trade up to a higher pixel Canon camera. The S40 appeared to be highly regarded in reviews. Up front I will say that with the appropriate settings set up (not auto), this camera can take some great pictures. But, in auto mode, the camera is less than spectacular - probably not as good as the A20. Flash shots at night almost always seem over exposed. I have had to use the M mode and dial down the flash brilliance. The camera has a tough time of focusing in average light conditions. If you have the camera set up through the center meter for focus (again, manually set), it works pretty well. But if you, again, use the auto mode, the algorithm between the difference points of reference it uses to focus, can cause the image to look very \"soft\". In all I really like the camera (albeit that it doesn't sound like I do), but my wife truely hates it due to the fact that in order to get decent photos she has to have the camera in specific modes. Therefore the WAF (wife acceptance factor) is a big 2 out of 5.<br />Another annoyance with the camera, is the multi-something on the right rear of the camera. You use this for erasing shots, and moving around. It is very hard to properly press, particularly if you just want to press straight in.<br />If you are primarily taking point and shoot photos, really look at saving money and getting the A40 as it should do a much better job at simple quick snaps.","I was somewhat leery of this machine due to the questions of problems with low light and/or heavy contrasts. Don't believe the critics! It is superb. My wife, an artist, manufactures porcelan lamps. For the first time ever I can make a successful portrait in the dark with the lamps lit... And it does that in automatic mode! This camera loves to cope with heavy contrast, unlike nearly every other camera, digital or otherwise, I have used. Together with an external; storage device ( mine is the MindStor 10gb) I can make hundreds of high quality photos without stopping for a lengthy download. It is cheap when all the features are considered.","(1). There is 30 seconds length limit on each movie clip.  When reach 30 seconds, the recording stop automatically!!  I wouldn't have bought S40 if I knew this limit.  Think about it, if you are recording a important event which last longer than 30 seconds, you are going to miss something you do not want to miss!  To me, this is unacceptable.<br />(2). After you start shooting movie, you can't zoom.  This is unbelievable inconvenient.<br />(3). Only AVI format for movie clip is available.  I think mpeg format is better.  File size will be smaller.<br />(4). Amoung about 100 pics I took, I bearly remember any one that does not have red eye, even though I used red-eye reduction flash.<br />(5). Distortion on the photo edge, as you see in all other small cameras.<br />(6). My friend has a Sony digital camera, when it is connected to PC, you see the camera like a hard drive or CD.  It is very easy to download/upload files.  In S40, you can't do it this way.","I recently purchased the S40.  Once the battery charged we were taking photos in a few minutes.  This is a camera for the serious amateur.  The automatic setings are user friendly.  Lots of manual options as well.  Order a larger flash card (128 MG) to get the best resolution and hold maximum number of photos.  Only drawback is the rechargeable battery, lasts about 1/2 hour with the display screen on.  Order an additonal battery to make sure you have power when you need it.  Easy upload to your PC with the software provided.  Still trying to figure out how to modify the photos we take.","This is my first purchase of a digital camera format.  I purchased this camera for my trip to China and was daring enough to just bring this one camera.  Well, in general, I was not disappointed.<br />In addition to the camera, I also purchased a 256 CF from SimpleTech.  This was more then adequate.  When I selected the medium format, I got ~ 220 pictures.<br />As for the quality of the pictures, in bright sun, the pictures came out quite wonderfully.  I felt the camera had problems with lower light situations.  I did find that the camera has the ability to control the shutter speed for longer exposure but it's not as convenient during a trip.  At the same time, I also compared pictures taken from the S40 to my friend's Elfp S200 and you can definitely see a quality difference.  I shots from the S40 have much more color depth.<br />A improvement I would like to see is a better zoom.  It seems that 3x zoom is acceptable given the size but more would be better.  Obviously there is a digital zoom but I tried it and without a tripod for stability, it can be quite useless.<br />On of the nice features I've found in this camera that didn't exist in older digital models was when you take a picture, this camera actually sounds a clicking noise.  I realize this is a really small thing but when you give your camera to a stranger to help you take a picture, you'd be surprised what a different this makes.<br />To sum it up, you can't go wrong with this camera if you're looking for a compact digital camera with some flexible features.","I can remember owning one of the first digital cameras that came out, the one by Apple computer. It was a very low resolution and was very battery hungry. Today's digital cameras has gone a long way. In fact, they can actually compete with film cameras in quality! Developing film is now in the past for me. This S40 will be my forth digital camera. I chose the S40 for it's size, all metal construction and Canon's name tag for their photography expertise. I knew if Canon put something out, it must sure be decent.<br />The S40 retails for $..., I paid a hundred less by shopping around. I did however buy it from a Canon authorized dealer which cost a lot more than the \"gray market\" cameras online. I don't trust those discount places, I never read anything good about them.<br />At first, I was disappointed with the S40 as I was playing with Canon's G2 right before I bought it. The S40 isn't as point and shoot as the G2 due to it's smaller size. It is much more sensitive to lighting conditions. Also due to it's small size, it is more difficult to hold steady. However, after a few days of playing with it and tweeking out the adjustments I was able to produce some very high quality pictures.<br />The auto mode on the S40 is terrible and almost can not be used. It always seems to focus on the wrong part of the subject. For some reason, it tends to focus on the background more than the object you intended to shoot. This is due to their 3 box focusing system. Very similar to their Automatic SLR's. But I didn't have this problem with my Elan EOS. However there is a counter to this problem. I simply use their Tv or Av mode. This allows for focusing only in one box rather than three and it allows you to adjust the aperature or speed at touch of a button.<br />This is truly a real camera and not only a point and shoot. It can be switched to full manual mode in just one click. I like the way it tells you exactly what f stop your are at and at what speed you are going to shoot. And with a simply push of a button you can change the f stop and speed very easily right before a shot. It's like a fully digital manual camera!<br />The flash is slightly inadequate but not as bad as some other brands that I have tried. Also the battery is very short lived. It uses a proprietary lithium ion battery and is rated at giving you 180 pics with the screen on and 420 pics with the screen off. Not bad considering my last camera gave me about 30 pics with a set of batteries.<br />It will however give you about 1 day of heavy usage, that's about it. You will almost definitely need a extra just to be safe.<br />One of it's best feature is the design. I like the fact that I don't have to fumble with a dangling lens cover. The S40 incorporates it's lens cover with a clam shell design. Just slide the cover over and it turns on automatically, snap it closed and it shuts off. I also like the all metal construction. I hate plastic cameras!<br />It also doubles as a camcorder. You can record short avi/mpeg movies. 30 secs in high resolution and 120 sec in low resolution. However this eats up memory in a hurry so if you like this feature, get ready to put out for some higher memory. The camera uses Compact Flash, which is slowly starting to turn into the industry standard in storage. It also allows you to use micro-drives if you are really into storing large batches of pics.<br />This is a good camera for those who like things small. It's a beutifully designed piece of equiptment considering it's size. Does it compare to it's bigger brother, the G2? NO. But it's not designed to. This is a good compromise for those who want 4.0 megapixel in a small package. For those who need and want the best pictures possible from a digital camera I would recommend the G2 but for those who don't need the very best from a picture, this is a very good and well made camera.","This camera only has a bit higher resolution than my old S20 (4 versus 3.2 megapixels), but pictures are much better. White balance is better, there is less noise, there seems to be higher dynamic range, and I get fewer washed out pictures outdoors. Shutter lag is much less (although autofocus seems slower), and it has a 3x versus 2x zoom. Flash also seems stronger. I also like the image dial, not sure why they didn't do this from the start (or just copy all the controls from their 35mm SLRs).<br />The best new features are the video clips and RAW mode images that are not much bigger than superfine JPEG. I can now get lossless images off the camera and play with them without paying a TIFF-sized penalty. I've been using Breezebrowser to do batch conversions and it works well. The video clip capability is also cool - I always thought it was stupid when this started showing up on digicams, but it is great for filming kids. The 30-second limitation isn't as much of an issue as I thought, though the quality is lacking. Can't wait until these little digicams get 640x480 at 30fps - would still not be as good as the miniDV camcorder I have, but I hardly ever use the camcorder, whereas I almost always have the digicam.<br />The only negative I've seen so far is that the autofocus seems to be worse than on the S20 - slower, noisier, and has problems in low light conditions. Part of this may be the AF focus assist light on this seems dimmer than the S20. Overall though, the focusing system is more flexible - settable focus points plus manual focus if you really want. And you can set metering too.<br />And finally, hitting the AE lock button while holding shutter button halfway will fire the preflash, letting you use this camera with standard slave strobes - kind of kludgy, but cheaper than springing for one of the new \"digital\" ones that support cameras with preflash.<br />In addition to the camera itself, there is a nice underwater case for it that is under $. For most other digicams you have to shell out major $$$, often more than the cost of the camera, for third party underwater housings. This alone would have been a major factor in choosing the camera; in addition to using it when diving, which I do infrequently, it's also great for taking beach or pool pictures without worrying about getting the camera wet, and even with the case the size is pretty small.<br />All in all, a pleasant upgrade - twice the camera at half the price I paid for my S20 two years ago. Of course in another two years the S60 will be twice as good and half the price of the S40. Such is progress.<br />As far as problems go, I was unable to get USB cable connection working at first.( I only wanted this to set the owner name, I use a Firewire compact flash reader for downloading photos). Turned out to be a compatibility problem with my Bearpaw 1200 flatbad USB scanner. Now I have the camera working, but the Bearpaw is broken even after driver reinstalls :-(<br />It would be nice if this camera were smaller. Like the digital Elphs, but with the S40 features. Oh well, I guess in a couple of years...","\"Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately Canon USA has not announced plans to release the PowerShot S45 in the United States.\"<br />So there you have it  - looks like the S40 will have to do. I wanted to originally purchase the Olympus Camedia D-40, but I've seen so many excellent reviews written by outside vendors on this particular camera, I figured this was a better purchase, although I'd like to hear more about the Camedia C-50Zoom coming out....","This is probably a decent camera, but in Europe, Canon recently introduced the PowerShot S45, which is significantly better. Information about the PowerShot S45 is on Canon's UK web site, and on Internet camera review sites.","This is a GREAT camera! Built VERY SOLID, easy to setup nice set of software and features. Get a good case for it, Canon didn't supply one (that bites).  Took a ton of pics and all crystal clear!  If you are thinking of this camera save up for a microDrive so you don't have to deal with storage issues.  16MB isn't enough for a 4MP camera.<br />Brite Flash, fast and easy, bye bye my Film Camera, now I need a good ink Jet to print too!<br />ONLY GRIPE!<br />I didn't like that Amazon didn't sell it direct, it went thru J&R...","I purchased this dandy little camera as out 1st digital camera and somewhat of an interim as we await the pricing on the more expensive models that I can use our existing high quality lenses on.<br />I am very happy with this camera!  It has great range for its size and many of the semi-professional features avid photographers will enjoy!<br />You can use it as a quick snapshot camera but if you want to this baby can do a great many things other higher end film camera's can do with the added benefit of seeing a very good representation of the final picture on the mini LCD screen.<br />On some of my treks I have accidentally dropped the camera from a few feet,  a few times on some rocks ( ouch ) but it is fine!<br />I am not a fan of the \"digital\" zoom since I think you can do that fine yourself with your photo editing software later - you just have to shoot at a higher resolution first.<br />For instance - while in Rocky Mountain National Park I saw a Marmot sticking its head up from between some rocks.  I simply shot him at maximum resolution and the 3X Optical Zoom - that creates a HUGE picture but then I used my software and cropped out what was useless and I have a wonderful Marmot picture and it looks like I was about 4 feet away instead of the 15 - 20 I really was.<br />I use the 128 MB Memory Stick I purchased afterwords and haven't needed the 16 MB stick that comes with it yet - not even close.<br />It's easy to hand this to others and let them take the pictures - you know they'll be horrible with feet cut off and too much sky - wall etc. but then you just crop it later and make it look like YOU took the picture :-)<br />It's a great camera for the price!","should have bought direct from Tech Depot and saved the freight charges.<br />a c slonaker","Easy camera to use. Bonus is the 30 second AVI's that you can film.  Easy to down load. Software interface is easy to use.  Recommend buying the 256 memory card and longer lasting battery. takes fantastic shots.  Excellent camera for the amature photographer who wants to take professional looking pictures. Most excellent buy!","I only have had the camera a week and I am returning it.  It doesn't power up when I press the \"display\" button like the manual says it should. However, it is working fine in \"Auto\" mode and it seems like an excellent camera.  I am not a very experienced photographer, but I am very impressed with the quality of the pictures.  Besides being a dud (don't they test these things before they leave the factory?), my only other complaint is the lens cover feels flimsy.  The rest of the camera seems sturdy and like it will last beyond the warranty.<br />The ZoomEx software that comes with it is adequate but weak.  Windows XP camera and scanner wizard is much easier to use and faster.<br />Bottom line: I can't wait to get a fully functional camera.  Its an excellent buy.","Now that the price is dropping, this is an even better deal:<br />*note as of 2003:  I did in fact get my camera back from the factory, they fixed the LCD screen quickly and for no charge as it was still under the warrantee.  Haven't had a problem since.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easy to use, but has many advanced settings for when you are ready to move beyond the auto feature<br />- Good zoom<br />- EXCELLENT high-resolution pictures.  I've downloaded all kinds of shots taken in all kinds of light, and then proceeded to crop, blow up, etc.  The results have been uniformly excellent<br />- Resonably easy and useful software.  By this I mean it's not Photoshop, but is very user-friendly and can handle all the basics.<br />- Small and lightwieght.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The viewfinder is TINY, so if you want to shoot pictures without using the lcd screen it can be difficult.<br />- Does not come with a carrying case (I got a decent on for less than $20 at a local store.<br />- I had to send mine in to the maintenance center for a serious, mysterious problem- the lcd screen suddenly died on me.  It's not been dropped or mishandled, so this sudden problem is very baffling.  I could still take pictures and download them but could not see the pictures as I took them, and could also not delete pictures from the camera after downloading as you need to use the lcd screen for this.  I am now waiting for the verdict (haven't gotten the camera back yet).<br />- You really need a bigger flashcard than the one it comes with.  I take a ton of pictures of my baby with this and quickly had to upgrade my flashcard as it runs out of room fast.<br /><br />All in all, with the exception of the lcd screen problem, I've been very satisfied with this camera and recommend it.","This is a great camera, highly recommended, photo image quality is great, even the video quality is surprisingly good for short clips.<br />The only gripe I have so far (which I've seen in many other reviews) is the set button, when pressing it you can easily press the arrow down/up or left/right by mistake, but overall it's actually not that bad and with experience it gets easier.<br />I read a lot of reviews of this and other cameras before deciding on which one to buy.<br />What I love about this camera:<br />- 4 Megapixel camera at this price point<br />- complete manual control available<br />- program mode will remember your last settings<br />- iso setting up to 400 - This is really great for getting good night time shots without having to use the flash<br />- very easy to use software with both win and mac/os x versions<br />- large lcd screen for preview<br />- fairly good interface and on-screen menu system<br />- good lense for a compact camera<br />A minor issue is the lense sliding door, seems a bit flimsy in the construction, like it would easily come off, time will tell. If Canon fixed this and the set button they'd have a perfect 4Mp camera in my opinion.","I own an Olympus E10 for my \"professional\" stuff.  But I  missed my Olympus pocket type camera when I gave it to my daughter.  I immediately keyed on the Olympus D40 but kept my options open.<br />I am concerned about color and so forth, but the important things in THIS camera were shutter lag time, ease of use for others, 4 meg results, speed and battery life.<br />I had the chance to side by side compare.  Sorry Olympus, but you need to work on some things in pocket cameras.<br />1.  Shutter Lag Time:  This is the time from pressing the \"button\" to getting a picture.  Though neither is extremely fast like the E10, the Canon is much faster than the Olympus.  You still need to pre-focus if shooting a moving target but with the Olympus, you still won't catch them in movement.<br />2.  Write Time:  The write time of the Canon is superior, especially using a microdrive--which it does.  Either I or II (microdrive).  I really prefer compact flash to SmartMedia, which is the like Beta to VHS in future I think.  It has it's place, but not in 4 meg cameras.<br />3.  Ease of Use--Both cameras utilize one of the most user friendly systems around.  Equally impressed with both.<br />4.  Batteries:  I did like the idea of AA batteries in the Olympus--but my very good rechargables were drying up like crazy while I played with it.  The Canon's lithium rechargable isn't cheap and you need two, but I am greatly impressed so far.  The charger is light and plugs right into the outlet--no cord.  Canon wins, even with the propriatary battery...P>5.  Zoom:  Neither is going to bring the world in like a true telephoto, but the Canon is much better here also.<br />6.  Startup Time:  When you pull open the lid, how long does it take to get a shot off?  That's why I have the pocket camera--spontaneity.  Canon again comes in first on time to ready.  Not alot, but faster.<br />Bottomline is Canon easily won this Olympus photographer hands down.  I'd rate the Olympus D40Zoom a 4 plus, but the Canon Powershot ... a clear 5 for its class of camera.","Great camera awesome resolution<br />I loved it","The pictures are as good if not better than my expensive 35mm slr. Color saturation and sharpness are very impressive. You have to get the 128mb flashcard for over 60 pictures at full quality. The camera is as easy or as complicated to use as you want to make it. We went on vacation the second day I had the camera and I didn't have to delete any of the picures I took.","Packed with professional features, this camera will benefit medium to good photographers.<br />The great thing about this camera is that it will help you make better pictures by giving you feedback on overexposure, light distribution and sharpness.<br />Minor points and I DO mean MINOR, are not-so-solid sliding door for the lens, battery latch that doesn't hold perfectly and weak flash (maybe that's a good point so you don't use it).<br />Major points for solid design, lots and lots of features, great colours, fast response times, RAW format, excellent picture reviews features and more more more.<br />Also include at least a 128MB flash card and extra battery when taking a longer holiday.","This is my 5th digital camera and, by far, it's my favorite. I've been through an entry level HP Photosmart, 1.3MP Canon A50, 2.1MP Canon S10, 3.34MP Nikon 995, and now the Canon S40. First of all I believe the Canon interface is far superior to Nikon's. It's cleaner and more simple.<br />What I like:<br />1) It's compact but not too small. You can't take a picture if your camera is too big to lug around.<br />2) Its metal construction is quality to the nth degree. At a time when consumer electronics feels flimsy as far as I'm concerned (too much plastic), it's nice to own something that's built so well with good material.<br />3) The picture quality is excellent. Like I said, this is my 5th digicam and the image quality is the best, by far. The colors are rich and the detail amazing. Everyone who has seen my photos are amazed.<br />4) The video feature is nice. You might not think it's necessary but I find the ability to capture up to 30 seconds of video (albiet not of the best quality) very useful.<br />5) Battery life is much improved vs. the older Canons and the Nikon. Without LCD on, you can take well over 100 shots.<br />What I don't like:<br />1) The macro performance is poor. The Nikon 995 did an amazing job in the area.<br />2) Low light situations results in poor shots.<br />What you'll need:<br />1) A larger memory card, at least 128MB. I went with a 256MB Viking which works really well. It's fast and holds up to 120 shots on the highest resolution setting.<br />2) A bag to protect your investment, I recommend the Lowepro 10AW. It's VERY well padded, has slots for an extra battery and memory card, and is lightweight. Some may opt for a smaller bag. It's a matter of preference.<br />3) I got an extra rechargeable battery. It's a safety net actually since battery performance is pretty good and you can always bring your charger along.<br />4) A LCD protector because the screen is prone to scratches. You can buy ones meant for color PDAs or try purplemoo.com and/or daprotector.com.<br />I am very happy with this purchase and consider the S40 the best overall 4MP digicam in the market for me.","This is my 3rd digital camera. I owned the Canon s100, which because of its size it's OK, but I was never amazed with the pics I got, specialy in the dark. Then I got the Nikon Coolpix 775, which I was never happy with, I think the Canon s100 was better; then I found this WONDER... the Canon S40, and now I can say I'm amazed the great camera this is. I wont change this camera for any other in the market today.<br />In brief, if you are looking for a realy GREAT digital camera, this is it. I recomend this for amature or advanced users. I use ofoto printing and have the best prints you can imagine, even large 20 x 30 inch posters with great resolution.<br />I do recomend a 128MB flash card or larger.","One of the reasons I bought this camera was that both Apple and Canon advertise it as OSX compatible, which is not completely accurate.  If you want to record images in Canon's RAW format, you can only download them onto OS9, using Canon's image manager, included in the box.  There is a noticable difference between RAW and the highest JPEG setting, especially when you start cropping and blowing up.  The good news is that images stored in 9 can be retrieved by Photoshop on 9 or 10, after you have used the Canon manager to transform RAWinto TIF files.  (JPEG  downloads on 9 and 10, but on 10  you have to export from i-photo for Shop to find them.)  Actually, switching back and forth between 9 and X is good exercise.<br />Photos taken at the highest settings are of excellent quality.  Movement by subject or photographer is a major concern considering the shutter pause, especially when trying to grab a quick, spontaneous shot.  Otherwise, the camera is solid, handsome, and a real champ.","I recently bought this camera to accomodate both my budding interest in digital photography and my desire for a great point-and-shoot vacation camera.<br />I am a very, very loyal Sony customer and was all set to buy their new 4 megapixel camera until I started looking into Canon.  Granted, it's not quite as small as the Sony, and it just doesn't have the same design elan, but when you get down to what counts - the ability to take fantastic pictures - I don't think any other 4MP out there can beat it.  The reviewers at the online digital photography review sites seem to agree.<br />I found it for a reasonably good price and decided to take the leap.  As promised, it took fantastic point-and-shoot pics and even better manually adjusted shots.  There did seem to be a little trouble with some of the automatic settings wherein the picture came out a bit blurry, but futzing with the setting seemed to help a lot. All in all, though, I have nothing but praise for this small little wonder.  (In case you're worried, the body of this thing is extremely solid.  It's primarily made of metal - not plastic like most others out there.)<br />The great thing is that the S40 does it all.  I took great close-ups of flowers, action shots of a dog running, landscape shots, portraits of friends.  All of these shots have an almost professional quality and cause every one who sees them to comment on how well they turn out.<br />In almost every case, the colors are true - never too dull, never over saturated.  The focus is very sharp, as well.  And since it's a 4MP, you can make nice sized prints - at least 8x10 - without making them appear pixelated.<br />Overall, the camera is easy to learn.  The controls can be a bit complex, but the manual is clear.  For those who prefer the trial and error method, the S40 won't pose too much trouble.  Everything is fairly intuitive, however, and even confirmed technophobes get the hang of it after a while.<br />One hint:  Be sure to adjust your screen for maximum resolution before viewing the pictures.  The CCD on the S40 is far crisper than most monitors, and so shots might not appear in their full splendor unless you make the screen resolution very, very high.<br />A few caveats:  the accompanying software - ZoomX Browser, or some such - is pretty basic.  You can't do much with it, even compared to the stripped down (and much better) Adobe programs out there.  Also, I'm using the camera on both an XP machine and on a Windows ME machine.  With XP, the computer reads it just like another hard-drive, making it exceptionally easy to grap and import photos.  With ME, it's a bit buggier.  I needed to call Canon's tech support (helpful and quick to answer the phone, by the way) in order to resolve conflicts between the camera and my printer.<br />Anyway, this camera is well worth the investment.  It won't make you a pro, but it will at least make your shots look that way.","4mp cameras are really just coming on the market in force, and this camera is a bit better value than most.  With its 3x optical zoom, all-metal construction, and features like photostitch (virtual panoramic shots) and movie mode, it is at the top of its class.  It is a great camera to grow into; this is our second digital camera, and we have moved from the PHD (push here, dummy) features on up to advanced things like manual shutter speed, white balance, etc.  I love it!!","Recently I borrowed the S40 from my local photo dealer with a firm intention of buying it unless something really unexpected turned up. With all the great reviews everywhere, my expectations were high when I started exploring the thing. And the S40 surely is a nice camera: beautiful finish, good controls (apart from the multi-controller which is too small and unstable), impressive sharpness and colours and a lot of manual-control possibilities. And once you get familiar with the menus it is easy - but not very fast - to operate the camera.<br />But I returned the S40 because:<br />1) The lens suffers from huge barrel distortion. The camera is simply uncapable of reproducing a straight line outside the centre of the picture. Most zoom lenses - even on SLR's - suffer to some extent from this disease, but this is about the worst I've ever encountered. The problem is present at all focal lenghts within the S40's range, but worst in wideangle mode. Buildings and plane surfaces bulge out in an almost psychedelic way which is very unnatural and unpleasing - to my eye, at least. It is a mystery to me why this phenomena is so seldomly mentioned in reviews. Once you are aware of it, you will notice immidiately. Maybe the lens on the Canon G2 performs better in this respect (I haven't tried it yet). But then you might as well bring your old SLR, since the G2 is too bulky for your pocket anyway.<br />2) The coverage of the optical viewfinder is ridiculously small. You get at least 25% more in the final picture than you see in the viewfinder. Since the LCD-screen is useless in bright light (and will drain your battery faster than necessary) this means that a lot of cropping will be needed. In reality you will often waste a megapixel or more before you hold the final result in your hands. If you are into careful edge-to-edge picture composing you should consider other alternatives than the S40. But, sadly, most viewfinders I have seen on digital cameras are even worse than this.<br />Why don't any manufacturers produce a compact digital camera like the S40, but with a decent viewfinder, an option for external flash and a fast high-quality lens with a fixed focal length equal to the classic 35 mm (in other words: a mini Leica)? I would buy it on the spot. 25 years ago the market was flooded with small, inexpensive compact 35 mm cameras like this. I own one of the kind (the classic Ricoh 500G), and it still takes extremely beautiful pix. With the possibily of auto-exposure, fully manual controls and without trigger delay, fisheye-infected perspective or ridiculous vignetting. I want a digital version. Someone give it to me, please!<br />In my opinion the S40 is a great (but slightly expensive) pocket companion for snapshots and everyday non-critical use. But if you are looking for a serious alternative to a good SLR or viewfinder camera, this is not it. I, at least, will save my money for tomorrow, when a digital SLR-body comes within my financial reach. Sadly, I dare no longer hope for a compact digital camera with a decent lens.","You need to spend a good deal of time with it to get a grip on all of the features. Other than that, It's a great camera. You realy should upgrade to a larger memory card if you want to take hi-res photos.<br />The main reason I wrote this review is to point out that even though the tech specs say this camera is not compatable with Mac OSX, it in fact is. iPhoto has no problem recognizing the camera, neither does the image capture utility. You will need to use image capture to transfer any mpeg movies to your computer.","Bought this camera two months ago, and just love it. Strongest points include fabulous pictures, compact size, ease of use and looks","After much research, I decided the Canon S40 was for me.  I purchased a 256mb card also.  After two weeks of use, I am quite satisified with my purchase.  I had read in a review or two that the flash was only mediocre performance.  The reveiwer must have a pretty high standard because I so far cannot find fault with the flash performance.  I am also impressed with the camera battery charge time, usually in less than an hour after low battery alarm comes on.  I had planned to purchase a second battery, but I may not need to do that now.  I do find the sliding lens cover to be somewhat flimsy when not fully open or closed, but that is about the only detriment so far.  Overall, I think I made the right purchase and Amazon's delivery was very good also.","I have been shopping for a digital camera since November 2001 until now (May 2002) and finally found what I think is the best compromise digital camera in the market, everything considered.  Once I decided that nothing is going to replace my SLR system for speed, flexibility, or quality of image for all situations (at any price range?), then it became clear I had to accept some compromises.<br />I simply wanted a compact digital camera that produced high quality photographs - not snapshots.  Why take pictures if the potential quality is not going to excellent?  It is a false economy to invest in a camera that does not even have the capability to produce high quality photographs.  I think this camera has overcome that burden and has the potential.  It is not perfect on an absolute scale (so it really shouldn't get 5 stars), but for what it delivers, it is a buy.<br />Some compromises:<br />Since it IS compact, the controls are small and the on-screen icons are small and a little hard to read.<br />All the functionality is there if you want full control, but you need to master the manual pretty well to get full use of it AND be fast on the draw to navigate the controls to get the results you want in fast changing photo situations.<br />The auto-focus and exposure lag is still not what it should be and is not fast enough to replace a manual SLR.<br />The lens is slow (f2.8 wide angle and f4.9 telephoto) limiting use in low light situations without a flash.  But, it is sharp.<br />Like other people have said, get a 128 MEG flash card, an extra battery, and a USB flash card reader for your computer to make this a fully functional package.<br />I consider this camera as my quick \"take-along\" camera that can produce high quality images when I don't want to lug around my SLR gear.  I tried it for sports photography but it is too slow and without enough zoom (3x, to about 100mm 35mm standard).  It is also for my wife, who can use it as a point-and-shoot and get superb results.","First I need to state that I am not a camera specialist. However, when it comes to buying a new product, particularly electronics, I go through most of what is for sale at that moment. Reading lots of reviews of various cameras for a couple of days on the internet gave me some ideas of the cameras which were among the best on the market at that time and I ended up with the Canon Powershot S40.<br />I had some basic criteria's for what my camera should do.<br />(1) - It should be small and portable.<br />The Powershot S40 is a small and compact camera, although it is a bit heavier than other cameras with the same size. However, since it is made of metal, it gives you a sturdy feeling. Being small and portable is the property that might decide weather or not you will be able to capture those moments that occur every now and then.<br />(2) - It should take great pictures.<br />The Powershot S40 takes pictures with good quality (based on my weeks of experience) and with its 4 million pixels, you can easily select a part of a picture and still have nice resolution. By having 4 million pixels it is easy to select a part of an image (cropping) and print/use that one, for example the upper right corner of the picture is all I want or maybe just the face of your girlfriend to put in your wallet. If the number of pixels are to few you might not be able to use this technique. Also, since of the high resolution, you can easily print sharp nice pictures.<br />(3) - It should be simple but at the same time have the possibility to let me \"grow into the camera\".<br />The Powershot S40 provides a fully automatic mode that allows you to take those simple \"point and shoot\" pictures. The camera has several pre-defined modes for different occasions (night scene, landscape, portrait and so on) that make the camera easy to use. Furthermore, the camera allows you to adjust many parameters (if you want to) such as shutter speed, aperture priority and ISO film-speed. After a couple of weeks of use I have been able to take pictures that I have never been able to take before using an automatic camera, for example in dark conditions, night shots and so on. These photos can now be made good.<br />However, nothing is perfect. There are 3 things one must have in mind when deciding to buy this camera listed in importance order:<br />(1) - You need more memory. The provided memory card is way too small. You need at least 128MB in order to not have to transfer pictures to your computer so often. On one 128MB card I usually store around 100 pictures. 128MB cards are quite affordable today.<br />(2) - You need an extra battery. Using only one battery is ok for most situations, but these days when you are taking more photos, for example at a party when you are showing the pictures to your friends using the LCD screen of you camera, the battery will not last. Having a spare battery solves this problem. I guess it is possible, but you will have to work hard in order to use up 2 batteries in one day. Recharging a battery is very fast, usually between one and 2 hours.<br />(3) - The camera is a bit heavier than other cameras with the same size. This is not a problem to me though. With its small size I could (before I bought a camera bag) carry the camera in the pocket of my jeans.<br />Enough said. I strongly recommend this camera that is suitable for most users. It produces great pictures and it provides a lot of possibilities for manual adjustments together with a nice set of predefined automatic operation modes. Remember, the Canon Powershot S40 does not only take great pictures, it looks good too.","First I need to state that I am not a camera specialist. However, when it comes to buying a new product, particularly electronics, I go through most of what is for sale at that moment. I decided in mid. April that it was time for me to buy a digital camera. Reading lots of reviews of various cameras for a couple of days on the internet gave me a picture of the cameras which were among the best on the market at that time and I ended up with the Canon Powershot S40. Throughout the review all comments applies also to the S30 version. The differences between the two models are the number of pixels used and S30 also provides you with the option of take pictures using film speed ISO 800. S30 is also a bit cheaper.<br />I had some basic criteria's for what my camera should do.<br />(1) - It should be small and portable. Since carrying your camera with you or not is what is going to decide weather or not you will be able to capture those moments that occur every now and then.<br />(2) - It should take great pictures. Having captured that special moment, verifying that it looks nice on the small LCD-screen on the camera, and going home to find out (when you look at the picture on your computer) that it is blurry or got some other flaws, is not the situation we want. Another important property is the number of pixels the camera use. Having more pixels allows you to select a part of an image (cropping) and print/use that one, for example the upper right corner of the picture is all I want or maybe just the face of your girlfriend to put in your wallet. If the number of pixels are to few you might not be able to use this technique.<br />(3) - It should have the possibility to let me \"grow into the camera\". Being not professional, I wanted to have a simple to use camera that allows me to just take photos with one click. On the other hand, since of the great feature of digital cameras which allows you to see the actual picture directly after you take it and if you want, delete it, I suspected that I would start to do more experiments with photography, i.e., adjusting shutter speed and changing parameters (actually I have after a couple of weeks use which allows me to take pictures that I have never been able to take before using an automatic camera, for example in dark conditions, night shots and so on. These photos can now be made good). What the Canon provides is a fully automatic mode that allows you to take those simple \"point and shoot\" pictures as well as other modes that gives you the possibility to adjust more parameters. The camera has several pre-defined modes for different occasions (night scene, landscape, portrait and so on) that make the camera easy to use.<br />The Canon Powershot S40 fulfils all these criteria's and it is giving me a lot of great pictures.

It produces great pictures and it provides a lot of possibilities for manual adjustments together with a nice set of predefined automatic operation modes. Remember, the Canon Powershot S40 does not only take great pictures, it looks good too.","The Canon S40 is a superb digital camera.  First, the exterior: The S40 is compact and can fit easily in a jacket pocket (though not in a pants-pocket - for that you should check out Canon's digital Elph line); it has a convenient clamshell design; and unlike many of the other digital cameras I examined it is made of polished metal-not cheap plastic.  This is sturdier, feels better in the hands, and looks a whole lot sleeker.<br />Second, the interior: The S40 takes 4.0 megapixel pictures, which look great on any computer screen and will print out very nicely up to 5x7 and even 8x10.  Its ability to capture color is far superior to most other digital cameras.  Most of the control menus are reasonably easy to use.  It is packed with pre-set photographic options (for action shots, portraits, etc), but has full manual override for those of us who grew up on old-fashioned SLRs.  It also focuses much faster than many of the digital cameras I've seen - helpful for capturing wildlife or childrens' sports events.  Finally, the included battery is surprisingly long-lasting and recharges (with a very compact included recharger) quickly.<br />Third, the software:  The S40 comes with Canon ZoomBrowser (for viewing) and ArcSoft's PhotoSuite (for photo-editing).  I find ZoomBrowser intuitive and can easily organize my photos, however it sometimes has problems printing on my inkjet printer.  The ArcSoft program is much less capable than Adobe's PhotoShop, but can delete red-eye (or unwanted individuals at the edge of a picture) without too much trouble.  On the whole, both should be adequate for the casual user.<br />Are there drawbacks?  Well, yes, there are several.  Like most digital cameras, the S40 sometimes has problems focusing on the correct subject and, in automatic mode, often opens the aperature too wide (resulting in a narrow range of focus).  There is a way to manually focus the camera, but it is not terribly effective.  It is also impossible to attach separate lenses - but that drawback is common to any digital camera of this size.<br />Bottom Line:  Despite the drawbacks, this is one of the best digital camera's I've seen.  It is conveneint, well-built, and easy to use out of the box.  I've already dragged it to Vermont, Atlanta, central Africa and Australia without a hitch-not to mention that I can take it on my frequent bicycle rides closer to home.  I'd be happy to send a sample photo demonstrating its resolution and color-capturing abilities (about 1.2 MB) if you ask.  On a final note, I would suggest buying a 256MB (or larger) compact flash card.  This will let you take 200+ max. resolution photos at a go.","In general, my Canon S40 is a great camera.  It takes beautiful pictures, offers a greater number of options than many other renowned cameras and can be used both for simple tasks and also for tasks that requires advanced settings.<br />Advantages:<br />The S40 has many advantages, in general too many to complete in a list. But here are few of the most important issues:<br /> - Impressingly clear pictures.<br /> - A lots of options; most of them are simple to use<br /> - Can be used by mid-pros, semi-pros and even pros.<br /> - Microdrives can be used, offering up to 1 Gb of<br />  memory (5500 pics at min. res.).<br /> - The camera can record video and sound.<br /> - A surprising performance in low-ligh situations.<br />Drawbacks:<br />The biggest drawback is the multicontroler. It is the second most used button on the camera (only the sutter button is more often used).  It offers the user to select up, down, left, right and enter (pushing the multicontroller button IN).  It is easy to push in the four directions but requies almost a luck to success in pressing the button in.  I would have preferred another button for the 'in' selection.<br />The second drawback is how difficult it is for beginners to master the usage of the autofocus system. As a user, you'll have to select which spot of the proposed picture frame is going to be used as the auto-focus spot.  Changing spots can be a little complicated so I believe that many users will just take 'another picture' to get the focus right instead of mastering the manual and the methodology behind the autofocus system.<br />Other drawbacks are completely minor.  Often, the camera's setting & options can be complicated.  But that cannot be regarded as a drawback because it isn't possible to have a camera with all this great options if it is ought to be simple in all occurrences.","This is my second digital camera.  I also own the Canon digital Elph camera I love it but I needed something a little more robust for some higher quality digital photography.  The digital Elph is fine for 4x6 photos but I wanted the capability of enlargements and the small Canon was very limiting for me.  The 4 Megapixel resolution is quite remarkable and the photos prints scale very nicely.  I have produced some high quality 8x10 that gave nothing away to my high quality SLR in terms of print quality.  The Canon S40 is packed with feature and I am still exploring them but I can report that the camera is well designed and it gives you very good control to get the shots that you need.  The flash and battery life which were both problems I had to deal with in the digital Elph are not problems here.  I strongly endorse this camera for the people who need enlargements at 8x10 or larger.  I thought just maybe that I could put away my SLR but not yet. On my last trip I took my digital Elph, my Canon S40 and my Minolta SLR.  The Canon S40 was the star of the trip producing some great shots.  My Minolta SLR was the only one I felt comfortable using for some action shots in difficult lighting.  The digital elph was unused until the battery on my S40 ran out and I needed a couple more run of the mill snapshots.  For most photography work you could do just fine replacing your SLR with the S40.  If you purchase this camera you will need to buy a 128MB or higher CF card and an extra battery.  The great joy of digital photography taking a chance on a difficult shots because you know you can always delete them.  You do not want to be caught short of storage or power.","excellent, light weight camera with a ton of advanced features...<br />the clarity, crispness and sharp images, especially as they appear on a computer, are superb...a guaranteed hit....","Overall, this is a great camera for the price.  I did a lot of research before buying and am glad that I ended up with the PowerShot S40.  I generally agree with all the positive feedback of the other reviewers, but I thought I'd share the few gripes I have about  the camera in case they'll help others make their decision.<br />1) The expensive and virtually useless \"AC power adapter\" accessory (sold separately) is NOT what you think it would be -- it does not let you plug the camera into an outlet and charge the battery.  Instead, its AC adapter end actually replaces the battery in the battery bay area.  So you have to remove the battery if you want to run the camera off the wall current.  Consequently, you must also use the separate battery charging unit to recharge the battery.  (If only this camera came with a USB/Charging \"cradle\" like some of its competitors!  That's my biggest regret with this camera.)<br />2) The camera has a habit of falling asleep during the middle of long uploads, interrupting the upload.  (This is a big bug -- obviously, when the computer and the camera are actively transferring, the sleep mechanism of the camera should not kick in, but it does.)<br />3) The flash setting (I always prefer No Flash) is NEVER saved when the camera shuts down -- even when it sleeps.  Consequently, in the course of a casual day or evening of occasional use, you a) either remember to keep turning off the flash every time you want to take a picture, or b) end up taking the picture with the flash and then having to re-take it without.  The default flash setting should be one of the many preferences in the camera's system menu.<br />4) When you rotate an image in the camera, the image is not actually rotated when you import it into the computer -- you have to go and rotate them all over again after importing (this is using Mac OS X (Image Import and iPhoto applications).  Maybe it's different with other applications, but I doubt it.<br />Otherwise, this is a great camera with a great user interface -- it makes simple, point-and-click use easy, and hard, all-manual things possible.  There are even some great semi-manual modes.<br />I would strongly recommend it if you can live with the shortcomings I outlined above.","This is a little tank of a camera, with great optics and a decent optical & digital zoom combination, as well as awesome resolution. If you had to buy one digital camera for all needs, chances are you'd find the S40 a great hybrid of near-professional features and compact design. It does require a 2nd battery and a larger memory card to be ready to go, but aside from that, it's nearly perfect.","I purchased both the Canon S40 and the Canon G2 just before Christmas.  The G2 was for me and the S40 was for my girlfriend.  The reasoning was I thought that the \"Bulky sized\" G2 would be good for the \"serious\" shots and the \"Light\" S40 would be for the \"fun party\" casual pictures.  I was wrong.  First of all the Canon G2 is a fine camera and for the most part takes nice pictures.  Here are the good points of the S40.<br />Size of Camera<br />First it is lightweight, easy to hold and easy to put a shirt pocket (but for a short while, if you needed both hands for something else).<br />Picture Quality<br />The still picture quality is very good to excellent but I still feel that a good 35mm still has a slight edge in quality.  Every once in a while about 1 in 10 one comes out blurry, but if you can with a digital camera you can take it again.  Motion pictures (object is moving) are ok but I have not had a lot of luck with the quality again the good 35mm would win. The video quality is fair to good and at a 30 second time limit we only use it for fun or when our sheep dog a does something silly it just quicker to video tape it on the Camera are email it too friends! That is really nice.<br />Cameras ease of use<br />This is where the Canon S40 really shines.  This camera is very easy to use it's an almost pick up and use right away.  If your not sure about a button Canon User manuals very user friendly.  To view the picture, just slide the Power/Replay Lever to the right and there you go.  This is a very simple Camera to use it is fro the first time user or the experienced photographer.  The battery life is good, it last for almost a complete dinner party sometimes I wish I had two of them.  I do like that the battery comes out and goes into the mini charger with is easy to take along rather than the bulky one the G2 came with.<br />Print quality<br />I may write about this later as me printer is old put I have printed an 8 by 10 at a friends house and wow it looks great!<br />Recommendations<br />Get the largest Compact flash card available i.e. 128 or 256 they are really getting inexpensive. You will be happy you did. Second get a Palm pilot screen protector (cut to size) for the LCD monitor you will be happy when you do. And third get a card reader for picture transer to you PC, they are work the same price is not a factor and if you have Windows XP it will recognize the card reader and install its own software.<br />This is a great Camera all in all I am glad I bought the 4-mega pixel instead of the 3-mega-pixel version.  You will truly enjoy it as for the G2, well look for it on Ebay!","(...) After looking at the Digital Elphs and the A-series cameras, I stumbled upon the S40. This camera has it all. Four mega-pixels, a sturdy metal body, complete control over almost every aspect of your shot, and all in a compact size to boot. The feature-set is based on the popular Canon G2, which is a professional grade digital camera, so you know it uses a fully field-tested, high-quality internal design.<br />I mostly use this camera in auto mode, in which it takes absolutely beautiful pictures. They are clear, beautifully saturated, and capture motion extremely well. Indoor and outdoor pictures are equally impressive, and I found the metering to be very intelligent. That is, highlights, shadows, and exposure levels are all handled very well.<br />The camera offers an amazing amount of control with 12 user-selectable modes in addition to the auto mode. (...) But, suffice it to say that anyone seeking a high-level of control over their settings will not be dissapointed by the S40.<br />A Little Advice:<br />1. If you are looking to spend a little less money and do not need a 4 mega-pixel camera, a 3 mega-pixel version is available in the S30.<br />2. If you are looking for a point-and-shoot camera only, you do not need to spend this kind of money. Look toward the Canon A-Series cameras instead. These are plastic and lack the high-level of user control, but they are also much easier on the wallet.<br />3. Although this is a very compact camera, it is not the smallest that Canon makes. If you want the ultimate in portability, look at their Digital Elph line.<br />4. The proprietary battery that comes with the S40 is extremely powerful and has an impressive life. The charger is also very compact and very fast. However, I highly recommend buying a spare battery from Canon's website (for about $70).<br />5. Do not waste your money on the leather case for the S40 that Canon sells on their website. It is far too small for the camera and the lens cover slides open whenever you try to put the camera in it. I am not a big fan of sliding lens covers in the first place, and the leather case does nothing to win me over. Go buy yourself a generic camera case that fits the camera properly.<br />6. The included 16 MB CompactFlash card is embarrassing. Go buy a 128 MB card (at minimum). And while you're at it, pick up a USB card reader. They are under $(...) and are far more convenient than using the direct camera hook-up (although the S40 software and connection is quite convenient compared to many other digital cameras).<br />7. Be careful when removing the label from the lens cover. You can actually pull the cover right off if you're not careful. PEEL SLOWLY!<br />Conclusion:<br />Overall, this is a beautifully designed, well-built camera from an excellent company. As you can see by my review, Canon has won me over. In summary, the S40 matches the excellent picture quality of the finest Nikon and Kodak cameras available. The difference is, Canon does not skimp on the build of the camera by using cheap plastic parts. This, in my opinion, puts the S40 above the rest in this category.<br />Well Done Canon!","I have gone from a  Canon S100 and a Kodak 3.1 megapixels to the Canon S40. Has to be one of the easiest cameras to use following the simple menus. Response time, color and clarity of pictures just outstanding. Compact size and solid caase make it a true traveler. After checking most of the tech sites like dpreview everything I read was right on. This is the best bet in a 4 megapixel camera","I wanted a small camera that I could easily take with me everywhere in place of my Canon EOS and Olympus 140 (also small but not as small as the S40). Also considered the Nikon 885 which is even smaller but the Canon S40 was only $... more and was 4.1 megapixels rather than 3.1.<br />Love the Canon. It does well in all situations I've used it in. Not quite small enough to fit in a normal pocket, but it's still quite portable. Great pictures -- prints are clear and color rendition is quite good. Not up to a good SLR for those really critical shots, but great for most situations.<br />Has a relatively fast shutter delay for a digital. Flash is barely adequate and there's no provision for adding another. This is a common problem for small digital cameras. The optical viewfinder is small and captures only about 80% of the picture frame. I find it worthless, but one adjusts to using the LCD screen. In time I doubt that I'll even miss the viewfinder.<br />Easy to use and everything is organized so that the more complex features don't get in the way of the ones you use 95% of the time. Very nicely designed.<br />A bit expensive, and for most occasions a 3 mpixel would be fine -- in that case the competition is tough. But if you want a small 4 mpixel the S40 can't be beat at present.","This camera is easily the best ultra-compact highly portable camera on the market today. It has point-and-shoot capabilities with all the manual controls of the bigger G2. The ISO 50 with raw mode capability and the razor sharp Canon lens allow me to have great looking 11x14\" printouts with even a 16x20 is possible. The raw mode gives you lossless information from the CCD at one-third the storage space requirement in the camera. Once in the computer it can be expanded (losslessly) to the Tiff image. This is a big savings on space in the camera allowing you to take 2 to 3 times the high resolution pictures when compared to other cameras! It has many modes for specialized situations but I prefer the P mode which allows me to use the ISO 50 (automatic mode sets the camera to ISO 100) and let the camera do most of the work. With such a high resolution camera you will need an additional compact-flash card (128 meg or above)and possibly an extra battery. I love the quick review button (much better idea than on my old Canon G1). I also especially like the placement of the compact flash slot, even with my big fingers the card can be easily removed. My only problem is that is so portable that my wife has \"taken\" it over ;-).","I am a serious amateur photographer with several years of experience with multiple Canon products. I primarily take travel and outdoor photos and bought this camera to have a small digital camera to take when I did not want to lug my full 35 mm system around as it weighs almost 3 lbs. I found that I would not take the camera and several times missed great shots because of this.<br />After waiting a couple of years for the megapixels to increase in smaller cameras, I purchased this before a trip to Hawaii last December. I took this camera and left the 35 mm at home.<br />Overall, the camera functions remarkably well for its size. it has most modes of the Canon EOS system and the operation is very intuitive. It is a little slippery and I recommend extreme caution when handling this as it does tend to slip away from you.<br />The pictures of my Hawaii trip turned out very well. The metering was accurate on all but the most difficult shots. For those difficult shots, I was able to adjust the exposure compensation to get the exposure dead on. The lens seemed to work well at all focal lengths; however, at telephoto, the aperature is very high and shots seemed to beg for a tripod. The flash works well up to a range of 15 feet.<br />When I returned home, I printed all of my shots with an HP deskjet 960 on quality paper. I found that the resolution was adequate at the 5x7 size; but bad at 8x10. This is a limitation of the format and not the camera.  I think that I will take this camera along with the 35 mm systems on my future vacations. This is a wonderul tag along camera but no substitute for the resolution of a good 35 mm system for those \"money\" shots.<br />All in all, this is the perfect camera for someone who would like to have a small quality camera that they can fit in their pocket or bag with no worry. I would recommend an extra battery to have on standby and at least a 128mb memory card.","This camera is wonderfully small - it easily fits in a pants pocket and because of its built in sliding lens cover, it's very safe there.  I use it with a 1G IBM Microdrive without any hitch.  It has all the basic features of a good point-n-shoot and the user-interface is very well designed.  The image quality is good but because of the limits of such a small lens, obviously not for high end use.<br />Although I highly recommend this camera, the only complaint I have about it is that although it does have a \"manual\" focus mode, unlike SLR cameras, this one is dependent upon using the LCD screen to judge focus and the image on it while focusing is way too low of a resolution to allow for me to judge focus.  Put simply: the auto focus is good and the manual focus is unusable.<br />If you want a small digital camera that you can put in your pocket or throw in your bag, this is a great choice.","This is a great camera. Small. Great pictures. Great features. Dependable. I spent 1 year looking for the right 4 megapizel digital camera ... and I've now owned it for 3 months and couldn't be happier. I carry it in my pocket almost all the time and have taken over 2000 pictures. Everyone who sees me with it, wants one. Price is a little high but it's worth it! I highly recommend it. I'm going to pick up the waterproof case so I can take it scuba diving with me.  Highly recommended.","I bought this camera one month ago. I took about 700 pictures and had some of them printed at Ofoto. The result was just amazing. Sharpness, color etc... I have no complain. So far I just used point to shoot feature. There are many good features that I am getting into now.","I had the S20 before this, and I can't believe the improvement.  Like so many others, my S20 had the bluewash problem that was annoying even though correctable with image processing.  The S40 has no such problem.  I was also skeptical that I would see a difference upgrading from 3.2 to 4.0 megapixels, but the images do appear much sharper.  The zoom (3x as opposed to 2x on the S20) is easier to use and more responsive and the LCD display is also brighter and sharper.  The S40 has tons of manual options, some of which I have not yet explored (such as sound recording capabilities).  Additionally, Canon has now added the rechargable battery and charger to the package, which is a big plus.  The battery is also more compact and lighter.  The only annoyance there is that the AC adapter is a separate option, which is an inconvenience and a neccessity if you want to transfer the images from the camera to your computer without use of an external card reader (which is also an extra if you decide to go that route.)  All in all, the S40 is a sleek little camera with amazing photographic quality.  It is perfect for people wanting a point-and-shoot digital camera of the highest quality and portability that is self explanatory right out of the box.  (I would recommend reading the manual for the more advanced and manual opperation features.)","I had the S20 before this, and I can't believe the improvement.

It's equal to my APS camera in camera size and image resolution, more control over the image, and no more waiting for film to be processed.<br />My only complaint is that the included Zoom Browser software for Windows 98 is not very robust.  I permanently killed mine by trying to open a directory with too many images (400+).  Now it dies on startup.  Even reinstalling the software doesn't help.  Oh well, ThumbsPlus and Photoshop do the same thing.","Nuf Said!<br />After 6 months of research finally the perfect camera was born- A top quality pocket size camera with every conceivable feature (Audio & Video to all manual controls).<br />Thank You Cannon! I'm glad someone figured it out.","This is my first digital camera and I am very impressed.  It is the most functional point-and-shoot camera (aside from the quality of pictures).  It is very easy to use even with all the bells and whistles.  It works basically like a high quality 35mm camera except that the quality in the pictures is astounding.  It also has the ability to produce 30 to 180 second mpeg's.  This is a nice feature especially to attach them to e-mail's.<br />Maybe the nicest aspect of the camera is the software package included.  The installation was a breeze and the programs ran perfectly without any glitches.  It was probably 20 minutes from the time I opened the box to when I was downloading my first pictures.<br />The only downside to this camera might be it's size.  As small as it is I am afraid I will drop it and break it.  Other than that, this camera is fantastic and definitely a great buy.","All that I can say is \"WOW.\" The Canon S40 has met, and exceeded my expectations.<br />This is not my first digital camera, I also own a Sony Digital Mavica FD-72. A few months ago I realized that the Sony was not performing well in any situation where the lighting was less than ideal (Bright sunny days or bright indoor lighting).<br />My first question was \"What am I doing wrong?\" So I purchased the book Digital Photography For Dummies® by Julie Adair King from Amazon. After reading through the first 5 chapters, and surfing several Mavica websites, I began to realize that it wasn't me but the camera I was using. So I began my quest for a better camera. I based my requirements on recommendations from the aforementioned book and website reviews.<br />What I desired was a camera that was simple enough for a novice to use but also had enough, more advanced, settings for difficult lighting situations. An additional requirement was the size. My Sony Mavica is almost as big as a digital video camera, I wanted something smaller. The next major requirement was the photo size. The largest picture that my Mavica will take is 640 x 480. Other requirements included a view-finder in addition to a LCD screen, long battery life, and lots of storage capacity. The Mavica had a LCD screen only, it was difficult to see in bright sunlight. In addition, the Mavica drained the battery quickly and a floppy disk only holds about 1.5 megs.<br />The Canon S40 met all my requirements at a reasonable price. So far I've only used the Auto, or novice, mode and have yet to get a bad picture. I've tested my two cameras side by side and the Canon always excels.<br />I highly reccommend this product.<br />BTW, I first considered the Canon Digital Elph, model S300 because of the price. However, the Elph lacked the more advanced feartures like manual shutter control and apateur. I'm now glad that I paid a little more and the S40 is not that much bigger.","I'm a Canon guy and like most of what they put out, and this is no exception.  It's a very sleek little package.  Four megapixels, 3x zoom, auto and manual modes, a fairly long lasting rechargable battery, all in a tiny metal body.  I prefer this over the newer Nikon consumer digicams (the 775 and the 885) because the body is built better, the resolution is higher, and the Canon has manual modes.  I only gave this camera four stars because of a couple reasons:<br />a.  It's visibly less sharp than other cameras in this resolution range.  Not a lot less, but enough to notice.  The color is great, but the pictures aren't quite as sharp as the ones the S40's big brother (the G2) produces.<br />b.  The macro mode (or should I say lack thereof) isn't very good.  I find it odd that Canon hasn't worked on improving this in their newer model cameras; pretty much all of the Nikons have *excellent* macro modes.<br />Other than that, it's a sweet little package.  I like the fact that the play-mode button is no longer part of the control dial.  You no longer have to move the camera out of whatever record mode you're currently in to get into the play mode.  The play-mode is controlled by a little standalone switch on the back of the camera.  Slide it across once, you go into play mode, slide it across again, you go into record mode.  Another  positive is the long lasting lithium-ion battery (which has a quick charge time and does not require draining before recharging).<br />Highly recommended for most users.  If you think you'll be making a lot of large sized prints with the camera (i.e. bigger than 8x10), you might check out the G2 instead.","I have had this camera for over 2 weeks now and am very impressed with the photo quality and the wide range of shooting options available. The camera has a solid feel to it and the sliding lens cover not only protects the lens but doubles as an on/off switch. The feature rich menu and settings are candy to anyone who is interested in exploring the creative elements of digital photography. The automatic setting turns the camera into a no-brainer point and shoot for the neophyte. My wife took the camera to a childrens choir performance with about 30 seconds of instruction and came home with some GREAT pictures. The ability to pop out the CF card and put it in my notebook computer's Type II slot helps save the camera battery when I want to download photos. The sound recording feature and video are handy when you want to capture an action event. Overall I'm very impressed with this camera. Kudos to Canon.","I have had the camera for only a week now, but already taken it on a trip to California's lost coast. Not only did the battery pack last over the whole 4 days and 70 pictures, but its features will be very intuitive to any SLR user such as me. I found especially helpful the zoom feature in replay mode that lets you pinpoint just how sharp the picture really is. The only things I will be missing is a shoe for external flash and the possibility to use regular batteries. Although the pack charges very quickly."]},{"name":"Pentax Optio 430","amazon_reviews":["I have had this for 6 months,  and use it extensively. I also own a Rollei prego90, and a nikon n70.

It only has 4.2MP which is fine because if I ever need images above 2464 x 1648 I can just use interpolation. This is a very solid body, I love the 8fps, and for a 10 year old camera this still blows away the Canon rebel series. I also own a T2i which is great for the video, high iso, & high MP but the build quality of the 1D is far superior as well as the fps, & af points.<br />I highly recommend this, or if you have some extra cash then get the mark ii","I just picked one up for $600 and all I can think is, what was I doing messing around with the rebel series for so long. Yes the MP is low, however the image quality is superb. This camera surpasses any rebel out there and still out performs other high end models in many ways. If you are starting to get serious about photography, do your homework and you will realize that there is much more to photography than MP. Let's face it, if you are looking at anything less than a 5D, then you probably aren't making any real money on your photos. And if you don't plan on printing any posters, take a chance on a camera which can show you what performance is really about. Otherwise, keep taking your generic pictures and enjoy your 100 gigs of useless photos filling up your hard drive. If you are looking for some sample images taken with the 1D, check out the Canon EOS 1D group on Flickr.","I own an EOS  50D and I bought the EOS-1D as a backup for it. While the 50D has many features not incorporated into the 1D, its solid body and ruggedness make it purfect as a backup. The newer EF-S lenses will not work with the 1D, however, the rest do. It's speed alone make it a great for a backup!

The colors in the photos look very nice and appealing; warm and saturated. There is a 19mm wide angle conversion lens available for it, which I also bought, The camera is relatively small and compact and quite light weight. And if you're a Nikon Coolpix 5700 owner like I am, then you will be right at home with it's operation as the two cameras use an almost identical menu system and control layout, it just operates slower and is not quite as 'polished' or refined as the 5700 is in terms of smoothness of operation and even control button feel. And like most Coolpix's it's marco ability is simply amazing! This camera can focus right up to .800 inch from the subject, (that's just over 3/4 of an inch)!

I already have a ton of accessories and lenses for this model so purchasing it seemed to be a reasonable solution. The camera, although sold as used, seems new and in the original box and everything was included. It works perfectly and I am very, very happy.","Even in mid 2005 the Nikon Coolpix 5000 is a remarkable digital camera. In skilled hands this camera can produce results that rival even today's best professional digital cameras.<br /><br />I've made several 16x20 prints from images taken with the Coolpix 5000 that look AMAZING.

If you want a good digital camera capable of super-wide-angle photography, the Coolpix 5000 and the available wide angle lens is the BEST buy on the market today. As of July 2005 you can buy this camera and the available wide angle lens in excellent used condition for less than the price of most new point-and-shoot digitals that deliver WORSE image quality.","I have had this camera for a while now, and I have taken some excellent pictures with it.  I use a Macintosh, and it works with the computer beautifully, in contrast with the Olympus camera that I owned previously.  The adjustable screen is nice and the zoom suits my needs.  However, I cannot get this camera to work in the dark.  It just wont.  I went searched the manual for an answer and found none.  It drives me insane.  It's great for daytime shots, but in low light I might as well not have it.  I'm still glad I bought it, but I was dissapointed by this aspect.","great camera","It's a good camera but was used it and had issues that the seller was not aware of as it was not fully tested in my opinion and I had to return and bought a new  P&S camera with similar features made by another manufacturer.","This camera definitely has some issues, namely slow operational speed, (focusing and write times), which at first frustrated me, but it also has some compelling good points which is why I bought one, (even 12 years after it was released and I being fully aware of it's drawbacks having read the reviews on it for years) and I don't regret it. The colors in the photos look very nice and appealing; warm and saturated. There is a 19mm wide angle conversion lens available for it, which I also bought, The camera is relatively small and compact and quite light weight. And if you're a Nikon Coolpix 5700 owner like I am, then you will be right at home with it's operation as the two cameras use an almost identical menu system and control layout, it just operates slower and is not quite as 'polished' or refined as the 5700 is in terms of smoothness of operation and even control button feel. And like most Coolpix's it's marco ability is simply amazing! This camera can focus right up to .800 inch from the subject, (that's just over 3/4 of an inch)! The prices on this camera are so low right now, (I got mine used for $70.00) I just couldn't pass it up, and I'm glad I didn't. For all it's short comings I think the Coolpix 5000 is a worthy addition to your camera collection and one you can have fun with for a long time.","I bought one of these when they first came out in New York... it was the 2nd best camera I have ever owned... totally reliable and just brilliant.... 1st best replaced it was a D50.... another great one.... really good cameras..

I used many digital cameras including SONY and Olympus camera and got no good impression from those. My recommendation comes from the granularity of pictures taken. Pictures of other cameras found to be deteriorated when magnified using Photoshop. Coolpix 5000 gives clear images even when magnified to 800%! That granularity proves and certifies the sharpest image ever achieved in digital cameras. Every picture taken gives you greatest satisfaction in whatever photo scenes you encounter.","This is a very good camera, but the flash..... it's the worst thing ever.<br />At night it's impossible to take a good shot.<br />And I don't know if I can use as a webcam too.","The features mimic, and the performance matches, the best of Nikon SLR cameras. The lense quality is exceptional, and veratile.<br />The one-star off is for the accessories and battery life. Expect to buy 3rd party lense hoods, an add-on battery with more life, and extra memory.","Resolution outstanding and worth the effort to learn the complicated controls.  CCD failed and required two trips back  to Nikon over 5 weeks to repair, now working OK, Nikon responsive on status via their email service support.","I PURCHASED THIS CAMERA BECAUSE I OWNED A PHOTO LAB,AND I DEMAND QUALITY IN MY PHOTOS. I WAS SELLING THE LAB &  KNEW I WANTED TO PRINT MY OWN PHOTOS, AND THEY HAD TO BE AS GOOD AS THOSE I COULD PRINT FROM FILM. THIS CAMERA GIVES ME BETTER PRINTS IN SOME CASES THAN I WAS GETTING FROM FILM!!! AND THE ENLARGEMENTS ARE GREAT.","Anyone who values the following:<br />1. Portability - the compact solid construction is a bundle of joy. Also makes candid picture taking very easy - people tend to ignore smaller cams but react differently to a large SLR pointing at them.<br />2. 28- 85 mm lens - contrary to most people pitcing their money for longer zooms, the wider angle is more used in daily life - try shooting your birthday party at home with 35-100 mm zooms -they are useless. No other 5 Megapixel cam has this!<br />3.Low light and night scenes - with the new Rev 1.7 firmware the low light performance of the LCD is amazingly improved. I got some very good shots in moonlight with full preview of the framing. Set the focus to infinity and switch on the noise reduction.<br />4. Macro - retains most of Nikons heritage of Coolpix 900 series - but focusiing again can be slow if you are trying to capture a restless bee.<br />5. Lots of special functions - Best Shot selector for sharpest photos, White balance bracketing, exposure bracketing. etc. But each change require fiddling with layered menus. So before going out for each session, program this into the user presets. For example - for landscape photography, I would program the two user presets for Matrix metering, spot metering and leave the third one for motion video.<br />Things to watch out for:<br />1. Memory : Buy a good Type I disk for added memory - avoid [inexpensive] brands and microdrives (CF Type II)- they both drain the little battery in no time. I found both Transcend and Sandisk brands very good, while RI data - I would avoid.<br />2. Battery - good to outlast shooting a complete 128 Mb disk with display on. A second rechargeable battery should be on shopping list for serious photographers. To save power, I let the camera go to sleep mode with lens extended - a touch on the shutter brings the cam back to life quickly. The view finder is optical (not electronic) meaning you can use this to frame shots without the camera turned on.<br />3. Resolution : mostly returned very sharp photos. Auto ASA feature is very good -the noise in 800ASA setting was noticeable more when you process the shot for color levels - but thats with any cam. After lot of experimenting, I use UXGA setting with fine setting which gives me 1600 pixel shots with minimum JPEG artifacts. This is adequate for most work and A4 printing. I do switch to the highest size (or TIFF) if I feel I will need to post process the shot a lot.<br />4. Exposure : Since I take more landscapes, I tend to use the Aperture priority a lot. Most of the modes work very well. I program the user presets to toggle between Matrix metering and spot metering linked to focus.<br />5. If you dont like the builtin flash - you have to go in for pricey alternatives - Nikon 50DX costs a bundle and only the DX series work with digicams- more powerful Nikon flashes make a ridiculous combination with the little camera hanging from the brick of a flash unit! The flash does not auto zoom - you have do this manully from the flash controls. Leave the camera in program auto mode for standard indoor flash photos.<br />6. The cameras controls are menu driven and can be quite complicated if you are not a gadget freak. You will have to spend time to learn to navigate to get the best out of this cam.<br />7. The 3X telephoto adapter lens from Nikon is quite sharp but is of fixed focal length - meaning it does not zoom anymore and the camera need to preset at 1.3X Digital zoom. Soemone told me alternates from Olympus work quite well with special adapters.<br />Summary : If you dont mind learning the menus and need a high performance in a small package - this the camera for you, especially for its 28 mm wide angle and swivel LCD monitor.<br />Things to watch for :<br />1. Expensive accessories - flash, lens etc.<br />2. No standard rechargeable battery - must use Nikon.<br />3. Layered menu commands take time - long learning curve.<br />4. The focus lock on front of the camera difficult to operate.","The learning curve was a little rocky the first two times I used it.  Practice makes better, (if not perfect,) and I blow away comparisons from friends shooting top of line Kodaks and Sony.","With the new $$$$ rebate and the new firmware 1.7, this camera is awesome! I can make great images with the RAW (NEF) files. This is one amazing camera!<br />The pictures are amazing-I can print them at 13 x 19 on my Epson 2200 and you can't tell whether it is film or digital.<br />You have to get this great wide-angle camera!!","Produces images that rival film.  Typical Nikon quality -- feels solid and everything works like it's supposed  to.  A camera you can grow and learn with -- it has more features than most amateurs will ever need.  Easy to use in auto-everything mode, but also has capabilities usually found only on top-of-the-line film cameras.  Downside?  The non-threaded lens is an annoyance that Nikon easily could have avoided.  The LCD display works great most of the time, but it's almost useless in some lighting situations.","I have been a Nikon camera user for over 40 years. I also have the latest SLR camera, which of course I love. I was initially very critical of the complicated manual instructions.  However, after having spent sometime playing with this camera, I find it a good addition to the Nikon family.  This is an excellent camera and the adjustable LCD screen is a fantastic feature.  You don't have to be a contortionist to photograph the ceiling of a building anymore.","NEGATIVES FIRST - This is an extremely capable but complicated camera for the average consumer. I will repeat - EXTREMELY COMPLICATED FOR THE AVERAGE OR INFREQUENT USER. This camera comes with a 200 page users guide. The user guide does a poor job teaching the use of the camera ( consider an aftermarket P5000 book- several have appeared on amazon ). If you takes pictures once & awhile- you will not like this camera - you will need to bone up on the use of the camera due to its complexity. IE you will need to carry the book with you to refresh your memory on some modes. Some will say, just leave it in automatic mode - well that is great - unless you inadvertently invoke one of the custom non-automatic modes - due to the dizzying array of buttons all over the camera. I have blown several important shots due to the camera getting into an unintended mode ( IE shutter or aperature priority, suppress flash etc. ). From a human factors standpoint - the design of the camera controls is confusing - you can invoke one camera mode in a variety of ways - using a combination of control buttons. IE can use a cursor control on back with the LCD menus, you can used the rotary knob + \"FUNCT\" or \"MODE\". The camera is sized for small hands - think about that when you are holding a [dollar amount] camera ! - you do not want to drop it !!!. ( that being said - would also consider a warranty on this camera -from a reputable source - in the current economic climate - they may be out of business in a year or so .. ) Easy to block flash exposure sensor with finger - have to consciously be mindful of where your fingers & camera stap are on this camera.. Lens cap is cheesy - mine broke after 5 hours of use. Cannot add a UV filter with out the fiddley adapter ( no threads on lens barrel ) - with the adapter - the camera no longer fits in your bag - so it is a challenge to protect the cameras lens. Zoom is insufficient for my needs. Tele-converter has excellent performance but has a cheesey attachment system - excellent but clumsy ( you don't want to drop that either ! ).<br />POSITIVES: Very good macro & 5 mega-pixel sensor . A jeweler friend of mine uses his P5000 to shoot diamond close-ups for his web based business. The NIKON gives pro-model color saturation/balance, contrast & brightness - a challenge when shooting diamonds & other brilliant light reflecting things. Battery life is better than most point & shoot cameras - if the power management feature is used. That being said - the power management feature drives you nuts - camera goes to sleep in in-opportune times !!! Have blown very important shots due to the camera going to sleep. ( This can be overridden - but then your batteries life suffers )See \"impressive product with some serious shortcomings \" from Robert B below for more detail. Slow to focus & significant shutter lag. Recommend the newer faster flash memory cards - to minimize lag between shots - camera has to write shots to memory - the conventional memory cards are slower. Camera can take a 1 gig superdrive if desired ( so I have been told ) - but these thing are even slower& eat batteries. Charger is very cool - blinks red until the NIKON battery is fully recharged. Like the rotating LCD screen - I have a need to be able to shoot around walls & in places that I cannot access myself - IE full arm extension with camera at unusual angles & use swiveling monitor to convey image. Cannot see monitor in bright sunlight though - you will need an aftermarket \"hood\" if this becomes an issue. Software & USB cable works well - use my laptop as a data archive when Im on the road & taking lots of pics.<br />MISC: Buy a camera bag with a soft liner inside - many camera bag materials will scratch the LCD monitor & or lens. Ive met several people with the P5000 whose antireflective coating has been worn off due to stowing the camera without the cheesy lens cap affixed - because it broke of course !<br />SUMMARY: My dropping [dollar amount] camera, $2[dollar amount] teleconverter + $[dollar amount] on a warranty gives testimony to my initial excitement about this camera because of its sophisticated features, NIKON brand quality and compact size. However, after using the camera - I have found the human factors design of this camera to be very/quite aggravating - so much so that I have \"fallen out of love\" with it - I do not enjoy using it. It is still an excellent camera - I just do not enjoy using it. For me to keep something this expensive - I need to look forward to using it. This pro-sumer camera, with it's \"knocking at the door with pro models - price \", should not suffer the other digital camera shortcomings that characterize low-cost, point & shoot models - such as shutter lag etc. Further, at this price I could find a used pro model ( pro models characterized by not having shortcommings discussed ). Im returning this camera until NIKON addresses these issues. Im historically a CANON loyalist, I'm now considering the CANON G2, the latest MINILTA DIMAGEs ( fantastic value ), a used pro model, or possibly one of the newer high end OLYMPUS models w/8X zoom (because I need a hefty zoom ).","I think this is a great camera. It is my first digital camera and I am really happy with its performance. It has only one problem (that's why I didn't give it 5 stars): in a few occasions the flash didn't work very well. I mean that the night pictures sometimes remians to dark.<br />In any case, 99% of the time the results is extremely good.","I bought one and I love it! The image quality that this little jewel produces is awesome. This one is fitted with a Nikkor 28-85 mm equivalent zoom lens and like all Nikkor lenses, it's sharp as a tack. The color saturation is fantastic and it takes great black and white shots as well (if you really want to have some fun get an infra red filter play around with it a bit). And it is absolutely fantastic with macro shots!!!<br />As far as the image quality with the built-in flash (seems to be a gripe that some have expressed), I seem to get acceptable results if I set the white balance for flash photography; however, I've never seen a camera (digital or 35 mm) that has a built in flash unit worth raving about. For the best results, I'd suggest a good dedicated flash with a swivel head to support bounce flash. This camera will accept just about any Nikon flash unit.<br />I haven't found the filter adapter to be much of an issue (with the exception of setting a polarizing filter). However, setting a polarizing filter is a pain on any rangefinder camera. The shutter release delay is a digital camera thing -- I work around it by depressing the shutter release half way in anticipation of the shot, then gently sqeezing a shot off at the right moment. The response is instantaneous. You just have to change some of the habits you learned from using 35mm. As far as the LCD in bright sunlight -- that is also a digital camera thing. You can buy a third party shroud that helps with this (or make your own).<br />This brings me to several of my \"nits\" about the camera. The viewfinder is too small, and it you tend to get more in the image than you see through the viewfinder. This can mess up your composition in a quick shot. The power zoom is a bit slow, and I'd like a bit more zoom at the telephoto end of the focal range.<br />But overall, I think the CoolPix 5000 is an excellent value. You just can't argue with the quality of the images that this little camera produces.","I am a professional radiographer and photographer (25 years now) and I used both the Sony Mavica CD400 & CD300, as well as a Nikon Coolpix for this year's field research season x-raying mummies in Peru.  This means the cameras were pushed hard.....blowing sand, huge contrast ranges, high resolution radiographs needed, fast manual control of radical light conditions, etc.....essentially most of the tough conditions and imaging requirements you can imagine.  Here's what I found:<br />The Sony Mavica CD300 beat them all.  It's not the most expensive or the best resolution but we all thought it did the best job.<br />Mavica CD400: best resolution but extremely slow recording time made it impossible to work with most of the time....the CD300 often got 3-4 shots while the 400 was recording one.<br />Mavica CD300: not the best resolution, but now that I've done some prints for publication from it's highest res setting I will not be buying any more 400s....just not a significant enough difference, plus it's not as heavy or bulky.<br />Nikon Coolpix:  not in the running by comparison with the Sonys....although it is more lightweight....we are buying mini CDs for 33 cents each in bulk at BestBuy and getting 140-180 high res images per CD.....they are so easy to format, initialize, and copy on any CD burner that I can't believe we even considered using memory stiks, or USB downloads.<br />The best features are common to both the Sony Mavica CD300 and 400 series though.....manual control of the images, excellent close up abilities, decent wide angle (which can be enhanced with add-on lenses if necessary), and both rapid video and automatic functions with night focusing for flash, etc., etc.<br />Finally!  There is a great digital camera....but it isn't a Nikon.","This camera is amazing.  You have the flexibility to do practically anything.  I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who wants a full featured camera or at least one with many options.  There are cheaper alternatives if you just want a point and shoot, but for a serious camera this is it.","I've got to revise this product downward.  After I lost the ccd chip Nikon either gave me a new camera, or fixed the old one.  I don't know which.  They say the fixed it, if so why did they put those stupid colored stickers back on the body.  I've decided that I can't use this camera for any kind of work because of the way it finds focus.  I never know where it's going to focus in a scene.  I did some simple \"stand up 'em up against the wall\" and the manual focus mark said I was focused on their faces.  No NO, the camera focused on their chests and the faces were slightly soft.  I was on a tripod shooting at 1/4 sec.  I don't know if this is an adjustment problem or what.  I just never know where it's going to focus.  Pretty annoying.  At least with my 35mm I can choose the focus point.  I probably can with this camera also?  Now which menu would that be on.  If anything this camera is not simple or user friendly like the 900 line.","I recently ran into someone who owns one of these. The owner spent the next half hour telling me all the wonderful things this camera can do. The story ends up he is a freelance writer of some great repute and did not have to buy the camera, Nikon loaned it to him to test drive.<br />I freely admit the pictures it takes are stunning. I sure would love to be able to add additional lenses to my camera. But I have to ask myself if the Coolpix 5000 is worth the money.<br />For me, the answer is short and sweet, \"No\". My purpose in owning a digital camera is to take photos to send over the Internet. I don't care how fast your connection is, no one is going to want to download the huge files this camera generates! Yes, it is the right choice if you want to print you photos, but at what it costs, are you really going to take with you when your family goes to the local theme park and your kids love the \"soak zone\" or flume rides? No way, I'm not sacrificing a Kilobuck for a happy snap! If my current camera gets trashed, yes, I'll be disappointed, but I can afford to replace it. If I trashed a Coolpix 5000, I'd have a hard time replacing it.<br />Yes, it's a great camera, but ask yourself, why did you decide to go digital? If it's for fun pix, the Coolpix 5000 may not be the ideal choice for you. If you're into digital photos for commercial use, then maybe this is the camera for you.<br />I'm rating this Middle of the Road for its technical excellence at a very hefty price tag.","The Nikon Coolpix 5000 is a very impressive camera in many regards although I have found several significant shortcomings that prevent me from recomending this camera at this time given its price. Rather than list all of its many strengths I will focus on several critical weaknesses that I hope prospective buyers will find insightful.<br />1) images taken with the built in flash are very inconsistent with many underexposed images. Nikon suggests that this is due the operator inadvetantly blocking the flash exposure sensor and this is true, althoug it is not the only problem. If you obstruct the flash exposure sensor in any way you will get terrible results. The problem in my experience is two fold: the flash expsore sensor is very poorly located and it is easy to obstruct.  This is a critical design flaw which Nikon techical support representatives will admit. More importantly, I found that even when the sensor is not blocked, the Coolpix 5000 generates very inconsistent exposures when using the built in flash.<br />2) the camera's autofocus is suprisingly slow, particulary under lighting conditions anything less than strong daylight. Furthermore the autofocus is not nearly as sensitive as one would expect in the year 2002 and at a price of approximately [price]. This camera occasionaly stuggles to focus accurately, particulary indoors under lighting conditions you might readily encounter at home or in a restaurant.<br />3) between the autfocusing time and the pre-firing image processing that takes place in digital cameras there is significant lag time between when you or your subject are ready for the image capture and when the camera is ready. I understand that this time delay is inherent in all but the most expensive digital cameras although I was hoping for better from Nikon at this price level.  This delay makes this camera ill suited for candid photography and any type of action photography.  You will miss as many moments as you capture.<br />4) in bright sunlight the comprehensive camera data displayed in the monitor is virtually unreadable. The problem is that the control panel which also displays camera data doesn't show all the data a user needs in many situations and this can be very annoying. For expample the control panel displays either the shutter speed or aperature but not both.<br />5) the camera does not perform matrix balance fill flash which is an important feature and one I expected given the price.<br />6) my Coolpix 5000 came with Nikon View4 software for uploading the images to the computer and Nikon View4 is a very poor product, although Nikon has released Nikon View5 which addresses the shortcomings of View4.  I have now used Nikonview5 and it is much better than View4 although it has problems of its own.  Nikon seems to think they are simply selling a camera when they are in fact selling a specialized computer for taking pictures and a computer is only as useful as its software.  Don't expect much form Nikon's software at this time.<br />7) I bought the Coolpix 5000 because of its sophisticated featues and compact size although I found the camera to be loaded with an inane number of features and settings that only a digital camera engineer could fully apprecitate. One can ignore most of the \"noise' generated by the numerous \"excess\" features, many of which have little or no utility value, but the \"noise\" does cause confusion.<br />In summary the Coolpix 5000 is loaded with features and is a very sophisticated, well designed little camera that records fantastic images under many conditions.  Nevertheless the camera has several serious shortcomings that are fairly frustrating.<br />Additionally, for those of you new to digital photography please be aware that all of these companies (Nikon, Canon, Kodak, Fuji, Olympus, Sony, Minlota, etc. are rushing to capture market share in the broad consumer market and as a result they are delivering products with various flaws, limitations and deficiencies. There is no doubt that digital photography offers numerous advantages over traditonal film although my experience is that the industry is still in the frontier phase and as such not ready for the mass market.  If you have a lot of time to learn, like to tinker with new products and are fairly competent technically you will do fine if you are willing to except a few limitations.  Personally, I am going to return the camera and wait 12 to 18 months until more of the \"kinks\" are worked out.","I have recently purchased a Nikon Coolpix 5000 from Amazon.<br />And I am totally amazed. The picture quality is GREAT! However,<br />if you are looking for a \"Point and Shoot\" camera right out of<br />the box--then forget about it! To really appreciate the beauty<br />of this camera, then \"YOU MUST TAKE TIME TO READ THE MANUAL\"!<br />The Nikon is full of \"Bells and whistles\", and if you skip the<br />manual then you will miss the feats that this camera is capable<br />of. So, if you are tired of the same ole point and click camera,<br />then purchase the NIKON COOLPIX 5000! You'll be amazed at what<br />it can do. One more thing...the enclosed bundled software is<br />worthless. I am running a Window's XP upgrade. And as soon as I<br />plugged in the USB cable and turned on the camera Window's XP aknowledged the camera, loaded the drivers, and snatched the pictures right from the camera. I have Image Expert 2000 photo program that came bundled with my Dell computer and it will extract the photos from the Nikon very efficiently and put them in a folder. I tried the enclosed Nikon software and was totally dissappointed.  Enjoy your new Nikon.","I recently purchased the Nikon Coolpix 5000, my first digital camera, and am very impressed with the ease of use and the results of the images.  This camera has a ton of functions and you need time to learn how to maniplate the aperture and shutter speed, if you want manual control.  The flash that is built in does the job, without red-eye, which has been a criticism of this design.  In the macro mode (micro-photography) feature though the flash tends to be too bright and washes out the image. A hot shoe mount is built-in so you can use an alternate flash for macro.  Cropping images digitally and zooming features were exceptional, with crisp results.  Bulb settings (night time) and self timer features are other features of this cam.  I am impressed and would definitely recommend and purchase a Nikon digital cam again.","I was very disappointed when I first got this camera.  I had a Nikon FM (totally manual) camera for over 20 years and had FULL control over the pictures I took.  Once I started taking pictures with it, I was ready to dash it on the rocks!  I'd see the image properly framed in the monitor and in focus, I'd press the shutter button, then the lens would dance in and out before it snapped a totally out-of-focus image.  How frustrating!  I then tried a novel approach: I read the manual!  There's a lot of options on this camera to give it flexibility.  You need to get acquainted with it before you just go out shooting pictures, or you'll be TOTALLY frustrated.  I'm getting better with it and have been amazed at the resolution.  It does have its idiosyncrasies, but the more I learn and experiment with it, the more I know how to overcome those.  Expect a longer than normal learning curve, after which you'll start getting your money's worth!","I bought this camera primarily for archetecural shots and interior design.  I am very pleased with the resolution, clarity and functionality.  Nikon has gotten rid of that pesky little bug that shut the camera down if you started it without removing the lens cap and now what we have is a very nearly professional grade product.  The only limitation is the number of lenses available to it, but given the rest of the quality in this product, I find that to be a minor inconvenience.","This is my second digital camera. (The first being a canon Elph) I have found it able to produce extraordinary results in some areas, but difficult, unpredictable, and cantankerous in others. Certainly, the sharpness and gigantic resolutions are wonderful. However, I have found that its' auto-focusing mechanism seems somewhat unreliable in the macro-mode when compared to the Canon that I was using previously. IT seems to produce inherently high contrast images so that I keep the contrast reduction switch in the on position all the time.  Also, since I am old and anchored in the silver age of photography, things like multiple function buttons, and multi-page electronic menus are not only hard for me to see, but take a while to become familiar with. The good news is that I am now using the little devil every day, and have become quite adept(after six weeks) with it's particular ways of viewing the world. In summary, I would like to see them make a camera that blind old men like myself could see the menus etc. without having to put on reading glasses. But, the camera is sweet, and I would recommend it to the serious and dedicated photographer who is anxious to move into the realm of high end \"prosumer\" digital photography. It is not for beginners.","Having read some of the negative reviews, I had a difficult time believing that I owned the same camera. I wanted something small, and I knew digital was right for me in spite of some of its limitations.<br />I have had the camera for about a month and have taken over 1000 pictures involving indoors, outdoors, scenery, people, home interiors and animals. I couldn't be happier with the flexibility and results. Yes, I have taken extra pictures and wasted several... why not when you can \"throw away\" anything that doesn't please you.<br />The colors, clarity and resolution are nothing short of wonderful. Yes, I purchased a larger memory card, but I knew that was a necessity with any digital... High resolution takes a lot of memory.<br />The cameral travels well and with an extra battery, or two, the daily usages is limitless. On a recent trip when others were changing film, I was taking pictures of things they were missing, including photgraphing sea-turtles at a fair distance. This is where the digital telephoto worked very well.<br />In bright light, the flexible screen, which is otherwise perfect, doesn't function, but that is to be expected. It came in very handy though when I was in a group of people and wanted to take a picture by raising the camera above the crowd.<br />I am a very happy user of my new Coolpix 5000.","I bought my CoolPix 5000 late December 2001 and have been shooting with it in various locations since then. I am globally pleased with the camera, but found its enveloppe of usage to be somewhat narrower than I was expecting.<br />As a foreword, I should say that, this being my first digital camera, as well as my first compact camera, I don't have any other obvious reference to compare it to.<br />First, the good points:<br />- very good images at 100 ISO,<br />- small size makes it very easy to carry the camera with you at any time. The 5000 is a compact camera, this should be kept in mind,<br />- very high feeling of quality when handling the beast,<br />- very convenient orientable screen,<br />- great zoom going down to 28 mm equivalent. Image sharpness appears to be very good at all focal lenght and appertures (without any scientific data though),<br />- good image results in point and shoot mode,<br />- very convenient tools for image review after shooting (including zoom to the pixel that makes it easy to assess the sharpness of the image).<br />Downsides:<br />- price,<br />- poor flash results (power and exposure),<br />- poor autofocus when selecting by hand which sensor you want to use. Most of the time, the camera is unable to find focus even on contrasty subjects. I gave up using this quickly. The automatic mode, in which the camera chooses automatically a sensor on which it could achieve focus, works fine for most cases (on point and shoot mode I mean),<br />- a lot of noise when using 200, 400 and 800 ISO modes (this could be the same with other digital cameras). I would strongly advise not to use these unless you really have to. They might allow you to take a sharp picture, but the result will mostly be unusable unless treated with special filters in photoshop (it seems some guys have created special actions that are good at removing such noise),<br />- slow electric zoom (but this is a normal feature for a compact camera),<br />- very short battery life. Any serious outing has to be planned with at least one if not 2 spare batteries,<br />- camera difficult to master (even with a strong Nikon background ranging from F-301 to F100, but the manual in Japanese did probably not help :-)).<br />To summarize, I believe that Nikon just released the best compact digital camera for day light photography ever made.<br />The problem is that, at this price, most users will expect it to be more than a compact camera and might therefore feel somewhat frustated when using it. Personnally, I didn't own a compact camera anyway, so I don't really regret my  purchase :-)<br />I also believe that the overall strategy of Nikon will become easier to understand when they will have released their low end digital SLR camera (which should happen soon according to persistant rumours).<br />Bernard","Shopped stores, catalogs, magazines, friends, websites - compared to the 5 most comparable cameras - Bought for business use - plus several accessories for a great price, well below the supposed great market prices out there. I found it to be very easy to use. Pics were crispy clear. I especially like the compactness.<br />Quite intuitive once you learn the basics.<br />My prior Olympus SLR OM-1 lasted 21 years.","First of all, digital photography is not the same as traditionaly photography.  There is a slow response time on digital cameras actually taking a picture when the shutter release is pressed; this camera is quicker than most digitals that i have used.  One could have it configured to be quite slow when red-eye reduction is enabled or some of the other features.  Yes that camera is small, and yes you could put your finger over the flash sensor resulting in poor lighting... but if the camera was big then the complain would be that it is too big... and they had to put the light sensor somewhere far from the lens (or you could not attach wide angle lens without blocking it)... now if you don't care about adding lens, having the ability to use an external flash, and lack interest in being able to manually control every aspect of a shot then this camera is not for you (and if you are looking in this price range may i suggest you consider the fully automatic and small canon s40).  if you enjoy those sorts of things then this is the camera of choice...  it takes exceptional photographs, but it is not a film camera and comparisions to such simply do not make sense.<br />also, great insight can be had on all digital cameras by reading the reviews at dpreview.com.  good luck!","For me, the main past failings of digital cameras have been the lack of resolution and the lack of wideangle capability. With 5+ mpixels, the Nikon 5000 is finally up with 35mm film, especially after considering that a 35mm frame must be cropped to achieve the standard 5:4 image shape of the 5000. The 28mm equivalent of the low end of the zoom is not bad, and with the wideangle adapter it is really there. If you take long telephoto shots, you are going to need a tripod anyway, and you probably will be better off with a 35mm SLR.<br />The controls are complicated, but no worse than a Nikon F100. I doubt the control of many, many options can be solved neatly with anything short of a full-blown computer interface, and there is no space for that on a small camera. If you want to do much more than point and shoot, it really is necessary to read the manual.<br />Complaints about the camera having only a 32MB memory card seem off base to me. 128MB cards are about $50, so go buy a hand full. If Nikon included more memory, the price of the camera would just go up.<br />The controls are small, and I do believe that could be a problem depending on the size of your hands and your dexterity. I have average size adult male hands and average dexterity, and I do not have any problem at all. But give me just a few years, and there is a good chance I'll need the large-knob edition.<br />The small size is a great tradeoff as far as I'm concerned. I travel a lot, and taking an F100 with a zoom lens is right up there with carrying a spare anvil. The 5000 allows photography at well above the point-and-shoot level with great convenience. It's a gem.","You will not find another camera under $1200 with more manual control than the Nikon Coolpix 5000. Pro D1 users will be right at home but point-and-shoot photographers will have quite the learning curve to tackle. It's definitely a finesse camera so don't expect great shots to just spit out without a little tweaking of the extensive manual controls. Nikon's first rate construction, numerous features/controls, and very good image quality (although I did find the Sony F707 image quality to be slightly better) make this camera a worth wild buy and, therefore, I highly recommend the Nikon Coolpix 5000.","By the time this camera is ready to shoot, your subject is either long gone or scowling at you. Just forget candids of the family unless you're lying in wait--and wait you will. This is classified as a \"still camera,\" but more accurate would be \"still-life camera,\" because that's about all it's good for. From turn on to illumination of the red and green ready lights the delay can be around 30 seconds, it seems.<br />And another thing, it gets the flash exposure wrong quite often, and not just when light from the flash is bouncing off your finger into the sensor.<br />Also, the histogram usually appears to be inaccurate.<br />In short, it can take high quality pictures if you have the time to wait for it, and then retake the picture. Ironically, it's a little like using a 4x5 view camera. Although the 5000 is small, it's no zippy little joy.<br />Memory is not a problem. Just pop in a 1 GB IBM microdrive. Batteries are not a problem either. Just keep a spare in your pocket and you'll go (or wait) all day. If you power it up in review mode or with the USB connected, you don't need to remove the lens cap.","I traded up from a Canon Digital Elph (which was a real nightmare to use and had horrible resolution) to the Nikon CP 5000. The two cameras are like night and day. It is true thast the Nikon is 3 times the price of the Elph. However, the Nikon is easy to operate and the picture quality is super fine. The design of the camera body is great because it is very closely related to what you are used to holding when you use a conventional camera (a comfort I find lacking in many digital camera's oh-so-desperate to be futuristic designs). There is a right hand rubber grip that makes for a very firm grasp. I got this camera a few days before I left for a trip to Lisbon and I returned with great pictures and didn't spend a lot of time scratching my head.<br />It is an expensive piece of machinery and with the rapidly evolving technology of digital cameras the prices tend to drop fast, so give it a lot of thought.","with a better zoom.  I have been very positive when reviewing Nikon's digital cameras, and I consider their optics  the best. However, the 5000 disappoints me a bit; it's a very good camera and if someone were to just give you one, you'd have to be very, very pleased. But if you're laying out the cash, you might want to make some changes based on your priorities. The 5000 carries such a high price tag, in great measure, as a result of its spectacular 5.2 megapixel resolution. This offers, in short, is the ability to enlarge photos taken on the Nikon 5000 to poster size without their losing clarity. Basically, that's it; your standard 4\" x 6\" or even 5\" x 7\" enlargements aren't going to look any better than they would on a 3 megapixel camera with similar optics. However, on the negative side, images recorded in 5 meg mode take longer to write (i.e. the camera is 'busy' longer btwn shots), use far more battery power, occupy ungodly amts of space on memory cards, and make files so large that they can only feasibly be sent via email if both parties have exceptionally fast connections and can only be posted to websites if the webpage viewer has a very fast connection to open it. Now, what I cannot justify is that kind of resolution coupled with a pretty anemic 3x optical zoom. For most digital camera users, a good optical zoom will trump sky-high resolution every day. One more complaint: I don't like proprietary batteries and that's all the 5000 offers. It's a fine camera, but most users will be dialing down its resolution and wishing for a better zoom. For my money, I'd take the Minolta Dimage 7 any time over the Nikon 5000, and use the change to buy that 128 meg memory card you'll need.","Having recently purchased the 5000, My first impressions are that, the camera feels good, handles well and is fairly light in weight. The facilities it has is enough to keep anyone busy for some time. And once you have learned the basics everything else is easy. The quality of the lens is typical Nikkor quality, which produces some excellent pictures, However I wish Nikon had given it a greater focal length, my feeling is that I will have to buy a convertor just to get me that greater amount of distance. Two points that I find most dissapointing about this camera is the flash....which is too close to the lens and causes red eye despite in fill flash. (Come on Nikon you should have forseen this problem) The  battery life is very dissapointing...again I will need to buy a spare battery. The memory card should have been 64MB as standard.<br />Overall despite the few drawbacks. The quality of the pictures it has produced are absolutely superb and cannot be faulted. If given the choice again I would still choose this camera over any others, even the Minolta Dimage 7.","Having recently purchased the 5000, My first impressions are that, the camera feels good, handles well and is fairly light in weight.

If given the choice again I would still choose this camera over any others, even the Minolta Dimage 7.","I bought this digital camera primarily to take pictures of my 16 month old daughter.  The major things I was looking for in a digital camera were (1) high quality photos, (2) fast auto focus (so that I can capture my always-on-the-move daughter), and (3) ease of use.  I also wanted a camera that had some additional options besides auto-focus.<br />The Coolpix 5000 is fabulous on all of these accounts.  I tried several other digital cameras before, and this is by far the best I have used.  The photos are brilliant and the auto-focus is extremely fast.  We got the camera just before Christmas and have taken many exceptional photos already.  We can crop out our daughter from a picture, blow that up to an 8x10 and still have photo quality.  The colors are terrific also (not true with all digital cameras).<br />The only complaint I have so far is that the LCD screen is a bit hard to see in low light.","After using this camera for several weeks, unlike the author of the November review who wrote before any of these cameras were shipped, the CP5000 is far and away the best of the four digital cameras I have owned. It has a wealth of accessories available, including modest telephoto lenses (ideal for portraits) and wide angle lenses down to fisheye, not to mention flash units and a soon-to-be-released AA battery pack/hand grip. The hot shoe makes flash photography easy and allows for multiple flash. The color and detail of the images is astonishing. The controls allow the experienced photographer to set up the camera on the run without going through interminable levels of menus, while the auto mode provides point and shoot simplicity. Nikon hit a home run with this one, and it's flying off the shelves.","I have been using the Coolpix 5000 for the past few weeks, just enough time to shoot 1,000+ photos. My 3rd Nikon and 1st digital, it's lived up to my expectations: I've been more than pleased with the quality of the images, my ultimate criterion. While you'll hear a lot of wasted drivel on feature A,B,C and comparisons with model X,Y,Z, you need to decide what you're trying to achieve before investing this much on a new gadget. If you want to capture quality digital images for selected printing in 8x10 sizes or larger - and are willing to invest the time in learning how to make that happen - then this could be the camera for you.<br />This is no simple point-and-shoot, which explains why some users have been apprehensive. Personally, I prefer the multitude of options it offers, including these (all of which I have used so far):<br />- Ability to manually override nearly every automatic setting, including: exposure mode (S,A,P,M), focus distance, AF focus areas (5), flash level compensation, sharpening, white-balance, etc.<br />- ISO sensitivity from 100 to 800, manual or auto, enabling hand-held shooting indoors<br />- Spot, center-weighted, and matrix (256 segment) metering<br />- Hot shoe to connect external flash for more lighting options<br />- Wide angle lens (28mm equivalent) is wider than most 'standard' lenses on similar cameras<br />- 3 User Set configurations let you adjust quickly to different shooting situations/styles<br />- Shutter speeds short (up to 1/2000s) or long (8 sec)<br />If you do like novel features, then don't worry, you'll also get red-eye reduction, self-timer, movie mode (QuickTime up to 60sec @ 15fps, 320x240) and \"best shot selector\". Rumor has it BSS is a cool feature that rattles off 3 frames and stores only the 'best' - the one with the most information, i.e., sharpest & best exposed (but I haven't used it). I did like discovering after I played back the first movie that the camera even has a built-in speaker for audio during playback. I also like the ability to zoom into images up to 6.0x during viewing to examine carefully whether you captured what you wanted. The buttons and menu settings, while overwhelming at first, really are intuitively designed - once you've figured out a feature, you don't have to keep returning to the manual.<br />I've been really pleased with the images I've captured so far. Fleshtones are realistic, sharpness of images is pleasing (not excessively sharp, or 'digital'), and metering is accurate. There's plenty of data to work with in the 5 megapixel images, which I shoot in FINE .jpg mode yielding a 1.5-2.0 MB image at 2560x1920 pixels. The lens glass on the CP5000 is the largest of the Coolpix's so far, which probably explains the higher image quality.<br />The typical 'knocks' on the CP5000, and my opinion:<br />-\"85mm is too short!\": so is 200mm. If you want to shoot models on South Beach, get an SLR and a 400mm lens instead.<br />-\"32mb CF card is too small!\": if you rely on only one CF card, you shouldn't be spending this much on a digital camera.<br />-\"images are soft!\": I prefer mine stirred, not sharpened, and do the rest in Photoshop. If you let the camera over-do it for you, there's no getting back the lost/interpolated data.<br />-\"battery life's too short!\": you'll run out of card space first (I use 128mb CF). You just spent a grand - stop whining and buy a 2nd battery.<br />So, what are its real \"issues\"?<br />- No way to screw in a UV/protection filter. For some reason, Nikon opted not to put threads over the glass. You have to buy the lens attachment mount (UR-E5) and attach filters to it. An inconvenience, since you can't replace the lens and really should protect it with a clear filter.<br />-It's slow to autofocus, especially in low-light situations, as there is no AF-assist illumination. I generally use manual focus or set the Single AF mode in such situations, and it seems to work just fine.<br />-My indoor pictures using the built-in flash sometimes over-saturate the reds in fleshtones. I suspect this is because the bulb is a bit blue/green, and the white-balance logic on the camera over-compensates. I have kept the WB setting on \"Auto\", but I may fiddle with this a bit to see if another manual setting produces better results. When this has happened, I just tweaked the Saturation of Reds in Photoshop and they look fine.<br />- It feels smaller than it looks in the promo photograph. If you have big hands, you need to break the habit of groping the camera with your right hand. Otherwise, you'll cover the flash sensor and over- or under-expose your flash shots.<br />Should you buy one? Qualified YES! It's not for everyone. You can pull it out of the box and start 'snapping photos', but you might end up with snapshots that you could have made with a cheaper alternative. If you give it a little time and really learn how - and when - to use its many features, then I think you will produce even better images than you'd imagined.<br />You'll really like the CP5000 if:<br />-you like the convenience of Auto-Everything features, but want the creativity that only comes with Manual settings;<br />-you like the idea of plugging your CF memory card into an Epson/HP photo printer and spitting out snapshots, but you'd prefer to 'tweak' them yourself in an image editor like Photoshop.<br />-you can't afford a digital SLR right now, but you can't wait to start experimenting with digital photography<br />I like it, and I think you will, too. Make an informed decision, and be sure that whatever you buy is the right tool for the job.","I have owned several (seven, to be specific - Olympus, Canon and Nikon) digital cameras in the last three years and, like others, I have constantly upgraded in search of the \"ultimate\" camera!  I recently bought the Nikon CP5000 and am extermely pleased with it.  The picture quality surpasses all the other pro-consumer models I have seen.  If you like simplicity or if you are a control freak...the camera has it all!  It accepts a variety of add-ons (lenses and flash units).  The only one beef I have with the camera is that it does not make use of all the functions of my external Nikon Speedlite SB-24 flash (which has low-light focus and zoom capabilities).  The external flash unit works flawlessly in TTL mode but I would like to be able to use the additional features it offers as well.  Perhaps Nikon will resolve this with a firmware release in the near future (as an enhancement) - I am keeping my fingers crossed!  Otherwise, the camera is spectacular!","There are some great things and not-so-great things about this camera. Most importantly, however, is the fact that the images are distinctly cleaner than the 990 (which I have spent a LOT of time with). Aside from the nearly double megapixel resolution (which is why I upgraded from the 990), Nikon has added a feature called, simply, \"Noise Reduction (NR)\" which does in fact make for a very nice image - particularly important if you intend on using the image for hi-res offset print. NR does tend to slow the transfer-to-memory process a little bit (hardly noticeable unless you need to quickly take the next picture) but the result is worth it.<br />Color and contrast-wise, I've always been quite happy with the native Nikon digital images, pre-Photoshop (where I will manipulate them in a variety of other ways. I'm glad to not have to be conerned very much at all with adjusting the color).<br />OK, so, in my estimation, the image quality is terrific and overrides many of the downsides. To someone else, though, the downsides may make a difference - so here are a few of my discontents:<br />* First of all, this is one itty-bitty camera. Great, perhaps, if you're traveling around taking \"snaps\" (I hate that word) to send off to friends over e-mail. But if you want to work your images in a \"pro-sumer\" sort of way - meaning you want to work with something that is intuitive in its setup and use under all conditions and ergonomic in such a way that helps facilitate top-notch results, this little camera leaves somewhat to be desired if you're not using a tripod. I have found that the controls are so tight together that it's actually difficult to hit the right ones without accidentally also hitting others. The view finder is so tiny that, believe it or not, you lose it completely if you shift your eye a mere fraction to either side. There is an LCD read-out panel to the right of the viewfinder (the one which, on the 900 series, is at the top of the camera) which is only 1/2 the size of the 900 series. Frankly, it's a little hard to read.<br />* Nikon has incorporated a manual Focus/Exposure lock button on the front of the unit (customizable through the control panel settings) which must be pressed and held until the picture is taken. Ergonomically this is a very difficult thing to do if you find you want or need to change other settings after you've pressed the the lock button. I'm afraid fingers just don't naturally bend and distort the way Nikon requires them to in order to maintain this lock and use the same hand to make other settings. (It's not easy trying to use your other hand to help out, either - take my word for it.) A simple solution for Nikon is to make the button spring lock and release rather than requiring your hand to do the work.<br />* Speaking of ergonomic problems, it's VERY easy to accidentally cover up the light metering eye with your hand in the simple process of holding the camera. BAD pictures result from this. Very bad.<br />* If you turn on the camera (using the very small and hard-to-grasp on/off dial - again, half the size of the 900 series) and have the lens cap ON, the lens is not able to telescope outward (which it does by default) and this can cause trouble. Actually, I don't want to have to remove the lens cap when I'm simply transferring images to my computer anyway! By the way, you'll want to go to the Nikon website for a firmware upgrade related to this problem.<br />* Regarding \"red-eye\", Nikon has gotton better at reducing/eliminating it, but they're not there yet.<br />* If you have extra converter lenses for your 900 series, not all will fit the 5000. I personally use the WC-E63 wide angle lens quite often but now understand that it will NOT fit the 5000, step-down ring or not. I think the TC2x and 3x lens will fit, but you'll have to find step-down rings. I'm not sure about the FC-E8 Fisheye. Check the Nikon website for particulars.<br />OK, enough complaining. Here are some more things I really like:<br />* The 5000 has a built-in hot shoe to fit many or most of the existing Nikon Speedlights.<br />* The LCD image panel swings out and rotates to almost any angle. This really helps!<br />* The NikonView 4 software is a MUCH IMPROVED upgrade from the version 3.<br />* You can quickly go back and review your image(s) in either thumbnail or full screen size directly from the LCD image panel without having to change the command dial to \"Play\" mode.<br />SUMMARY: Great pictures. Ergonomically and intuitively hard to get used to. I don't feel that Nikon was thinking in the right direction when they made such a technically good camera (image-wise) and then jammed it into this little tiny box. This, to me, represents a fair disappointment. The 900 series cameras were SO much easier to handle.","I moved up from a 990 and I call this a great camera.<br />It seems like Nikon has thought of everything with this one. 3 program modes plus High Speed Continuous capture and the ability to record a 60 second .mov clip with sound make this a winner.<br /> While the zoom lens doesn't have great range on the long end as other cameras, other cameras don't have the wide angle range of this one.<br /> The glass is great, I've seen no red eye with the built in flash and my SB-26 just pops right on and works perfectly. I already own a 64mb flash card and find the size the be very useable, about 28 photographs at fine.<br /> The battery has allowed me around 65 photographs at fine with the monitor on.<br /> I like the feel of the camera, it's got a little mass because of the metal body but is still compact and light and will fit in my pocket, just like my 990.<br /> I recommend this camera and plan on shooting commerical jobs with it - where appropriate.<br /><br />Put it on a tripod and save as a .tif.  You will see a grainless image.  Pretty neat.","I had an F100, which was stolen.  So, after some prodding from a photojournalist friend, I decided to go digital rather than replace it.  I looked at the Canon G2, and I thought about an F5, or a used D1, or maybe something else...<br />I settled on the 5000 for three reasons.  1) I've used Nikon for 30 years.  I've never had a failure that wasn't my fault.  2) Some people claim this camera isn't durable, but the body's magnesium (not plastic), and it has a comfortable heft to it, especially when compared to the G2, and even to its little Nikon brothers.  3) 5.0 MEGAPIXELS.  That's more than many pro cameras.  The resolution's there.  You'd have to work to exceed the capabilities of this camera.<br />After using the camera for about two weeks, these are my impressions:<br />First, The small size is an asset.  Olympus and Sony make good prosumer cameras, but they're big.  This thing just about fits in a shirt pocket.  Despite the metal frame, the camera is very light.  I have large hands, and it is still comfortable to use.<br />Second, a photography instructor years ago kept telling me to GET CLOSER!!  Several reviewers (here and elsewhere) complain about the focal length of the factory lens.  What comprises the bulk of your shooting?  NOT 300 or 500, I'd bet.  This lens is fine for portraits, general sports, basic nature photography.  You might not nail a bald eagle at 300 yards, but if you're trying to do that, you've missed the point of this camera.  No tool is perfect, but this lens will cover 95% or more of just about EVERYONE'S range.  And, the wide angle of the stock lens should be great for landscapes/travel photography.  Tight/close isn't always better.  If you have to have it, MOVE CLOSER!!<br />Third, the resolution is AMAZING.  Unless you're going up against a D1H or something, you'll win.  Frankly, 5mp is overkill for most people.  But, it's sure nice to have.<br />Fourth, on a down note, the viewfinder (I'm talking the non-electronic deal that you put your eye up to) is a bit tricky, and somewhat inaccurate.  You do need to use the monitor to see exactly what you just shot.  But, that's pretty much the big advantage over film!!  I'd get an extra battery, though.  Also, the menus to set various controls are a pain in the neck to navigate until you get used to them.  Then they're not so bad.  But, for the average user, sticking the thing on auto is easy.  Like the F100, there are custom settings for aperature priority and shutter priority so you can have creative control over your end product.<br />Fifth, the red eye issue:  generally speaking, the closer the flash is to the lens, the worse the red eye effect.  I will get a separate flash for this camera eventually, but I've used the on-camera flash a lot.  The red eye reduction feature works perfectly.  But, if you're shooting fast-moving subjects like dogs, young kids, etc., it may be a problem.  You hit the button, the flash goes off about 5 times, and then the camera takes the picture.  You pay a price for the red eye reduction on ANY camera, however.  The good news?  The lag between pressing the shutter button and getting a picture when you're not using red eye reduction is virtually unnoticeable.  And, you can set a feature where the camera shoots 16 shots in a row, within a few seconds (NOT WHEN USING RED EYE REDUCTION OR FLASH, THOUGH)!!  Even my 5, 3, and .5 year olds and Jack Russell Terriers can't outrun that.<br />Finally, this camera will turn you into a serious digital photographer.  You will want a faster computer and a better printer.  You will need accessories, such as an extra battery, a larger flash card, a reader (if you don't have one), a bag (which doesn't come with the camera).  This isn't a bells-and-whistles package.  You get a camera, a serviceable but hardly adequate flash card, a battery, and an AC charger.  You're on your own from there.  This is really a $1300 camera in $1100 clothing.  And if you want to use filters, you need about $50 more in accessories/adapters, etc.  But it's still cheaper than a D1!!","I have had this camera for a few days now and am just plain wowed with the quality of the pictures. The shape is a nice departure from the 900 series twisty body but w/ all the features and a huge jump in image quality.<br />I am a Nikon owner since I was 13 years old (a Nikormat and then the first FM) and have continuously been impressed w/ their quality. The camera did at first ship with a couple of hiccups in the software but that's since been fixed with all of them currently shipping.<br />Nikon has also added a external flash hot shoe so you can get much better flash photos. It has an internal flash but if you want to really get a more natural light, add a flash as well and you'll be all set.<br />Happy photos!","I had this camera for the last 2 weeks. It is the best digital camera I ever had. I keep on reading reviews from people who never touched this camera. Do not listen to them.<br />It is a great camera with excellent quality pictures ( day and especially at night with a slower shutter speed).<br />Sure you can find lots of inperfections:<br />- Has a fixed lens.<br />- Uses the batteries in a short time with the lcd on.<br />I wonder if any of the critics will ever find a perfect product.<br />Check the camera specs and compare it with other cameras in the same price range and you will find out that its is the best value for the money.","When the Coolpix 995 (3 megapixels) came out, everyone was waiting for Nikon to release a 5 MP 'prosumer' digicam. Here it is, but it is lacking, especially when compared to other digicams on Amazon such as Minolta Dimage 7 (excellent 5 MP camera!) or Olympus EN-20 (another 5 MP gem but suffering from memory buffer issues).<br />See the list of PROs and CONs to see why you should skip this Coolpix.<br />PROs<br />- 5.24 Megapixels<br />- Digital zoom: 4x, Optical zoom: 3x<br />- Built-in flash (no fumbling for pop-up buttons)<br />- Accepts CompactFlashType I and Type II, and IBM microdrive<br />- Sharp Nikon quality lens<br />- Aperture range f2.8 - f4.8<br />- Superior macro abilities<br />- Comes with rechargeable battery<br />- Lightweight (.79 lbs)<br />CONs<br />- Bad red eye potential due to flash proximity to lens<br />- Comes with a small memory card (32 MB). These days one needs at LEAST 64 MB card for the large MP cameras<br />- Limited lens potential. The 35mm equivalent lens 28 - 85 mm is good, but almost guarantees you'll need to buy an accessory lens to get telephoto capabilities.<br />- OK battery life (approx 100 min.), could be MUCH better.<br />- Camera feels a little cheap due to its very light weight<br />Overall, the camera is GOOD, but not great. There are superior 5 MP cameras on Amazon that deliver just as good or better pics, and give the user much more creativity and control at ease.","I am very intrigued by this camera.<br />I will probably buy it.<br />I've used a Nikon 990 and a 950, as well as other brands.<br />No one outside of Nikon has seen a final 5000 yet, however a few observations...<br />I wish they had made this an SLR like their high end products (D1X, D1H, etc).  Sony, Olympus, Minolta and others are offering SLR's in thie price range.<br />The problem with not having an SLR is that if you use add on lens like I do, then what you see in the view finder is not what the final image will be.  This forces you to use the LCD screen for most of your shots.  This dramatically shortens battery life, plus the screen is close to impossible to see out doors unless it's a very cloudy day.<br />The ZOOM on this lens is not up to snuff. 3x zoom is fine for an entry level camera.  But for pro-sumer cameras like this 5x is really the norm (the Minolta is 7x).<br />Of course the Nikon cameras make up for this a little bit by having the best built in macro capabilities .  But for me this is little compensation, since I am far more likely to want to zoom in on a distant object then take a snapshot of an individual spore or other really tiny thing.<br />You can be a fan of Sony, Minolta or Olympus, but this is the camera they will all be measured against."]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DMC-LC5","amazon_reviews":["This is a camera that has everything a good camera should have in it and none of the junk alot of other digital camreas do have.

Untill the price comes down below 10K for a good digital back for my 2 1/4 in cameras, this is a top choice to use. The only thing better today is the E-1 which was not out when I purchased this camera.","Buying a camera for the resolution is like buying a book based on how many pages it has.<br />I suspect that many of the cameras which purport to offer higher theoretical resolution are in fact limited by lens resolution. The small size of compact digital sensors in comparison with film makes severe demands on lens quality, but the dedicated digital E-10 and E-20 lenses are definitely up to the task.<br />Pixel quality, rather than quantity, is definitely an area where this and the E-10 shine- the rendition and gradation of colours is better than most. Particularly good with greens, golds and blacks.<br />The other outstanding thing about this camera is the way it handles. The user interface (by the standard of DLSR cameras) is elegant, and satisfying. This is particularly the case if you regularly tweak the settings: the interface is aimed at making such tweaks while composing the shot, rather than having to step through menus prior to the shot, although this means you need to get to know where each button is by feel, and stay familiar with what it does. You also need to get into the habit of doing a quick \"cockpit check\" prior to shooting, in case of an inappropriate setting left from the previous session.<br />I'm a big fan of spinning a rotary switch rather than repeatedly pressing a pushbutton, and the designers of this camera clearly share that preference. In a nice amalgamation of the best of both worlds, you typically hold a button down with one finger to identify which parameter to tweak, while spinning whichever of two rotary knobs comes most conveniently under another digit in order to change that parameter or select from a number of options. The buttons are nicely spread around the available areas, so that you can find them by feel. Many are differentiated in some tactile way which confirms their identity. In some cases (eg manual vs autofocus) Olympus have opted for a dedicated rotary lever even though there are only two choices. This means your finger tells you what the mode is, eliminating the need for yet another confusing light in the viewfinder.<br />The balance and feel of the camera is very pleasing, and the buttons and dials fall nicely under the fingers. This is a \"Real\" metal-body camera, no expense spared in the case design and production, and it feels like it.<br />Personally I think the E-10 is an even better camera than the E-20, unless resolution is your paramount concern - the E20 has some speed issues, and extra options which may distract rather than adding value, depending on your priorities. The E10, considering how much control you get, has a minimum of fiddly \"smart\" bells and whistles- a great camera if capturing short movie clips with sound holds no fascination for you.<br />I have one major gripe: while there is a facility for hooking the camera up to an external (TV) monitor, to preview the image in real time (as it falls on the sensor)- and the camera comes with an infra-red cordless remote shutter release - yet, for some *entirely* unfathomable reason, you cannot use both these facilities at once, which reduces the remote to not much more than a gimmick. You have to shell out for an expensive extension cable release, and this is of limited length.<br />Minor gripes are mainly connected with the autofocus- you do have to pander to it in ways which are not necessary in the case of a wet-film SLR, and it is definitely slower. However if I had to choose between a better autofocus and the superb (for a DSLR) manual focus and zoom (both via lens rings), it would be no contest.<br />It used to bother me that the LCD down-angle is insufficient for high overhead shots, until I realised that I could angle the panel to \"maximum up\" and turn the camera upside down to take the photo. The image will still look \"right way up\" to you, although not to the camera.<br />All things considered, if you like to have lots of control of the parameters, and you use your camera regularly, this is a very good choice.","This is the only digital SLR I have owned, and it is the only camera I have had that is actually fun to use.  My film SLR left me gnashing my teeth outside the developer when I found out all too late I blew every shot on the roll.<br />That said, I have two gripes.  First,the 32MB card is a joke --holds 7 pictures at maximum resolution and highest quality compression.  If you don't upgrade the card, the only way it is manageble is to drop the resolution to 1 megapixel and 8x compression -- if that is all you'll use, what's the point of getting a 5 megapixel camera.  1GB  compact flash cards seem to be the best value today at less than $200 and they will hold 260 shots at the highest quality level.  256MB Cards may be doable at 75 shots, but smaller cards will certainly drive you to sacrifice on resolution and quality to get more shots on the card.<br />Second, rapid shooters will be disappointed since the buffer will hold 4 pictures, and this limit does not change with resolution oddly.  After the buffer is full, it takes up to 10 seconds for it to write each shot to the card.  You can shoot as soon as 1 slot is open, but to do a 4 shot burst again, you have to wait 30-40 seconds for the whole buffer to clear.  This will bother some users but not others.  The write time seems the same regardless of whether you use Smart Media or Compact Flash.","Well, after 3 years of serious consideration, I finally went digital.  I spent hours an hours considering which camera to buy, and since I've had great experience with Olympus in the past, I looked at the E10 and E20.  Once I got relatively acquainted wuth these two, I looked at other models.<br />I went with the E20 and I could want little else.

After checking online reviews and current prices I decided to go with the E20N. Many reviews had remarked on the qualtiy constructions of this camera which I can only agree with. This is one heavy, well constructed piece of equipment. Kind of like the Hummer of cameras. Not a camera one would use stricly for pictures of the kids etc. This is a serious tool for pros or semi-professional photography. Tons of buttons, menus and dials to learn how to use. But the results are excellent! I almost exclusively use the SHQ mode with creates about 4MB size files (2500 x 1950 at 144 ppi, low JPEG compression). This is good enough to create larger than 5\"x7\" output on an imagesetter at 133 lpi. On an ink jet printer you can get top quality prints on legal size paper. Next step up would be the Nikon D100 which costs about the same but without the lens! Only negative for me is the fact that it takes relatively long to save pictures to the storage medium.","If you're looking for a great snapshot camera, look somewhere else. This isn't it. This Olympus is a workhorse of a camera good enough to replace your film cameras. After years of shooting 35mm, this is the camera I picked to test the digital frontier. My main concern about going digital was photo quality but I have been impressed. Shoot at (near) top quality, run through Photoshop Elements, download to a CD-R, CompactFlash or SmartMedia and run it through your local photo lab at Ritz or even Wal-Mart. The quality is admirable. I took this camera on vacation to Canada and was not disappointed. Could you do better? If you already have Nikon or Canon lenses, spend the extra cash and buy their latest models. But for the money, you'd be challenged to find a better overall camera that will let you explore your own photographic passions.<br />The best features:<br />* True photo-quality at 8x10-plus (gives you room to crop)<br />* Feels like a real camera<br />* Bright lens with decent telephoto range<br />* Variety of settings to let you go totally automatic or manual<br />The worst features:<br />* It is somewhat heavy (although the weight does give you a sense of comfort)<br />* Slow write times to memory<br />* Small cache that fills up with about 5 high-quality tiffs<br />* Lens range (without extensions) is a bit limiting, especially outdoors.","The Olympus E20N replaced their E10 and now can capture 5 meg images.  This is a key upgrade to what was already a very fine digital camera.  The construction and materials of this camera put it into the upper echelon of consumer digital cameras and some would argue that this is a strictly professional tool.  What I like about it is the balance of features, quality and design.  Once Olympus manages to speed up the image storage process, the E20N will be worthy of 5 stars.<br />Many digital camera designers are scrambling to improve optical performance of the camera lens.  The need for a zoom lens that covers a wide range is hamstrung by the small size of even a 5 megapixel CCD.  This in part explains the poor image performance of many inexpensive digital cameras, but even in the lower price regime, Olympus has been an industry leader for years.  But a designer of a more expensive camera like the E-20N ... has more latitude in designing optics and herein lies a key strength of this camera.  The lens of the E-20N has a zoom range equivalent to a 35-140mm lens on a 35mm camera, with an aperture of f 2 to 2.4.  One can sight through an optical TTL viewfinder or via a swivelable LCD screen.  Excellent optics!<br />The control features of the E20N are also excellent, yet not perfect.  Many adjustments are set by holding down a dedicated button while rotating the camera's control wheel, which can be difficult to do one-handed.  The built-in flash has fairly decent range, but since the camera has a hot-shoe, an external flash can be added if necessary.<br />I like the ergonomic feel of the E-20N and I also like that it has four available operating modes: automatic, manual, aperture priority and shutter priority.  By using the new progressive scan mode, one can take images with a shutter speed of 1/18000th of a second, but the image resolution is reduced by a factor of two.  This might make you think this is an ideal camera for sports photography, but I'd disagree.  The camera is just too slow at storing image data.  It often takes over 8 seconds to store a high resolution image with the E-20N and this is the camera's most serious fault.<br />The bottom line for most folks is image quality and in this department, the E-20N does not disappoint.  If you ever make the move up to a large-format printer, you'll want a camera of this quality.  You can achieve excellent prints at 11x17\" with the E-20N.  For pictures requiring a slow shutter speed, the noise-reduction filter is very useful.","A beautiful camera to look at, as everybody does. The good points are; (in simple language) 1) Control, a lot. 2)Fast, under certain conditions. 3) Tilting view screen. 4) Remote cable access. 5) Outside buttons, a really good idea 6)Manual zoom control 7)Terrific flash. The poor points; 1)All digitals so far, have the problem of stopping movement in the shade, so does the E-20n.<br />2)Heavy. Can't help that though, with all that great glass. 3)The control knobs have a tendency to move when they shouldn't. Maybe a rub with the elbo, or hand or case or whatever. I have lost some great shots because of incorrect settings. What i do is use black electrical tape. I have it all over the camera, making sure things stay the way i want them. It works! and no sticky stuff later !! None the less, I love this camera","We tested this camera for compatibility with VeriPic. We put it through its paces in all the modes including adjusting manual white balance, IS, PS and Noise Reduction mode, sharpness filter, all combinations of the 5 resolutions and 3 compression modes. The camera performed flawlessly and what amazed us is the camera was very frugal on the batteries. Once set of charged 1600 mah NiMH AA batteries actually got us through 350 pictures! This was a very pleasant supprise. The technical specs also don't mention another gem...There is a large RAM buffer that allows you to take up to 5 FULL mode resolution (5 MegaPixel) photos one after another without waiting for the photos to write to the Compact Flash card! This means you can take photos quickly without having the normal digital camera wait between photos that other cameras have. (The manual lists a 60 ms wait between shutter press and photo capture. This is almost too small to notice and the user will think this camera responds like a 35 mm SLR). The photos look great in FULL resolution JPeg at 1:2.7 compression. Don't use the two TIFF modes because you'll run out of memory card soon and there is no noticable quality difference between the TIFF and JPeg mode so you might as well use JPeg and save some memory. Additionally this camera is VeriPic compatible! That means it is suitable for professional insurance or evidence photography work. We would have given this camera 5 stars instead of 4 except for two things we didn't like about it. The camera is a bit too heavy and hard to lug around unlike the direct competitor (Minolta Dimage 7 which is significantly lighter) and the second drawback is that it is significantly higher price than the Dimage 7. Otherwise it is a great camera!","The Pros: EXCELLENT IMAGE QUALITY and control. Very solid grip and feel - actually feels like a real camera. The lens is bright and sharp, image quality is probably the best I've seen. The focal length of the camera is great. Best thing compared to most digicams I've used: there is no shutter lag - the time it takes between you pressing the button (click) and the actual picture being taken. I hate that on some Sony cameras I've used in the past - by the time the camera actually takes the picture a person's expression or light conditions can change... :-(<br />All in all, a great camera for this price and probably the cheapest in its class of SLRs (compared to Nikon D1X).<br />The Cons: SLOW WRITE TIMES, but you can get used to that and learn to live with it. FIXED LENS - you cannot change lens with is good and bad. Good because the CCD elements are protected at all times and don't get dirt.. a problem with some digital SLRs. You can also get attachments that go on top of the lens for macro or wide angle, etc. The LCD screen is HORRIBLE - don't use that for composing shots too often.<br />I am waiting for the new models to come out at PMA end of Feb. 2002. At that time E20 should get cheaper - hopefully.<br />You probably must've read a lot of reviews by now. ....","I am now using the E-20N for our newspaper and have found it to be excellent for sports and news photography. The only drawback is the write time from buffer to card can be long and ties up the camera when the buffer is full. It is a little slow powering up, about 5 seconds. However, I am learning to overcome it and work around it. It takes excellent quality photos and does night football on the high school level very nicely with the FL-40 Flash. The flash is a necessary accessory. It is a wonder to handle, good focus, fast auto focus and love the manual flexibility it has. I definitely recommend it. I did not know if it would take night football, but it has done very well. I am still learning it and trying to master the many features it has. Very, Very good digital camera, it has all but eliminated our wet darkroom. we also use Nikon Coolpix 950s and 995, both very good digital cameras.","What an amazing machine this is. After suffering through the flimsy plastic trinket cameras with little or no real optical quality, I finally own a truly versatile digital camera. The E-20 (as with the E10) offers extraordinary flexibility in digital photography. Prior to my recent purchase I spent at least a year and a half researching and waiting for this last pixel jump. The E-20 offers all of the flexibility of a high-level SLR which is missing on most other digital cameras.<br />Good Points:<br />- The feel... It has enough weight for good stability, and it fits your hand very nicely.<br />- Excellent lens with the ability to add extenders, filters, what-have-you.<br />- Super Image Quality<br />- Good bundled software (Adobe PhotoShop Elements and Camedia)<br />- Image control<br />- SmartMedia, CompactFlash, AND Microdrive compliant with the ability to use more than one card type at a time (you can switch between the cards).<br />- True SLR (some competitors offer interchangeable optics, but still have you look through a viewfinder. What's with that? I want to see what I'm taking.).<br />- Great accessories! (I can't wait to get the lithium polymer attachment)<br />Drawbacks<br />- I'll have to get a better strap<br />- Flexibility & control vs. ease of use trade-off... there are roughly 30 buttons to learn (but most of us will want that kind of control).<br />- It doesn't come with a case... even a cheapie<br />- I need to buy stock in a battery company<br />- Remembering to turn it off whenever I open the media bay or change power source<br />This is probably not the camera you would buy for your instamatic dependent Aunt Sally or Uncle Jimmy-Bob, but if push came to shove you could always tell them to just put the big knob on \"P\" (Program) and snap away.<br />When you pick your camera, don't go by statistics alone (or reviews alone for that matter). You've got to get out there and see how the camera feels in your hands. If you've a history with good quality 35mm SLR's you are going to love the E-20."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix 2800 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["Camera is all I expected.","The Fujifilm Finepix camera was just like new. We have taken some very nice pictures with it and was well worth the price.","Having owned this camera for 12 years I'm still trying to find a decent replacement that takes such good pictures: superb colour and crisp images are the strong points of this fine Fuji product. While my Panasonic Lumix 16 MP is a good camera, it doesn't come close to the FujiPix' colour -- I'm always tweaking fotos to obtain the best result. Neither does the Lumix take such good indoor fotos as the FujiPix. I suspect the reason for the difference lies in the lens, the larger Fujinon being way superior to the Panasonic Lumix Leica lens. The FujiPix is limited by lack of a wide angle lens 2MP max, although I still wonder how it takes such true colour high resolution fotos at this level. If Fuji could upgrade this camera to a 12MP, wide angle version I'd buy it. However, with the pace of technology I'm forced to look at more exotic cameras: best fit will be the FujiFinePix HS30EXR or the Canon Rebel T3. Any advice would be much appreciated!","Everyting worked fine except no cable to transfer pics to computer was included.

Not a heck of a lot of features, but that was the cool part about it. All you really had to do was point the camera at what you wanted to shoot and pull the trigger. Easiest camera, ever, and it captured years of fun times.

LOL","This is indeed a wonderful camera. I have had mine now 3 years and it is still going strong. I have even decided to stay in the Fuji Line and get the S9100 which comes out this month. So when I have the money, I will be one click away form another great camera. My Dad has a Nikon and it is a 4MP and the Fuji takes way better pictures, quality and all. The only down fall on the camera, is taking photos in low light situations, it is difficult to see what you want to capture, but when you snap and look at it, wow, it is a whole new world, the photo is clear, crisp and so bright. I have taken wedding photos and get some great close up shots with the zoom, so much so the bride and groom are usually amazed with the quality and how great the Zoom works. Because if how amazed people usually are with the shots, I have started to give photos on a CD as a wedding gift, and guess what, it is a hit, everyone loves it, and I at times capture what the photographer that they hired missed. Also with this little beast of a camera, persons have asked me to take photos and they will pay me, yes for this 2 MP camera. Macros work great for the close ups and the flash is excellent.

Voice commenting is also a great feature. Good quality pictures and movies also make this camera great. I will soon get a link and i think the webcam function will great. There is only four problems.<br /><br />1. In low light the screens are black, in general you can guess but it still is annoying<br /><br />2. There is no mode for capturing action, which makes it blurry<br /><br />3. Similar to problem two, the camera has quite a delay before a picture is taken.<br /><br />4. This problem hasn't happened to my camera but it has happened to others, zoom error. It makes me kind of nervous it will happen to mine.<br /><br />In general if you want a cheap camera with good picures, good zoom, and some cool functions this is for you. But if you want to take a lot of action pictures or night pictures check out another camera.","Lens cannot retract, October 7, 2005<br /><br />I have been an owner of this camera since 2003.  I probably have taken several thousand images and would view the quality quite good.  However, I too now experience the same problem as listed by a couple other reviewers that the zoom lens now fails to retract and as a result the camera is now inoperable.  I contacted Fuji's customer service and basically they say they have no real record of this being a design flaw.  You need to send it to them to get a repair estimate ranging from $30 to $100.  They only warrantee the repair for 3 months.  Since I can buy a new 2800 for $100, it doesn't seem worth it.","I have been using this camera putchased from Amazon since early 2003. So far it has not give me any trouble, has been serving me tirelessly. I have taken a few thousand pictures by it, dropped it many times, but the quality has not changed at all, in spite of the fact that I dont take much care of it!<br /><br />A great investment indeed!","i love this camera it is awsome","When the camera worked, it was quite good.  But the first time its lens was not able to retract, I was able to get it fixed under my credit card's extended warranty.  Seven months later it happened again and it was out of warranty.  And the repair shop was not able to find parts for it.  I think Fuijifilm needs to issue a recall and refund.  I am doubtful whether I should buy another Fuji again.","This camera looks and works great, and for a long time, I had no issues with it whatsoever. The pictures were sharp, and of decent high resolution. Until I took this camera with me to Las Vegas, to take some night pictures. It worked fine when taking close-up night shots with a flash, but when taking long distance pictures, it became practically useless. First, distant images with flash enabled appear dark and blurry. If you disable the flash, images come out nice and colorful. Except they look like someone with Parkinson's disease was holding the camera - the lights are smeared everywhere - even if you stand still as a statue. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"just decrease exposure time\", right? I'd love to do that, if that was an available option.<br /><br />Of the 200 pictures I took, only 2 were useable (and even then, blurry)","I bought this camera after much research and after purchasing(and returning) a few other cameras. This camera takes very good pictures and is very easy to use. It comes with a detailed and easy to understand instruction manual. I would recommend this camera to anyone, especially for first time digital camera buyers. The only bad thing about it is it only came with a 16 MB smart media card, so if you take tons of pics you might need a larger card. I would also recommend rechargeable batteries!!----2004 Review<br /><br />I have come back to edit my raving (3 year old) review because, after using for nearly 3 years I also got the dreaded \"zoom error.\" My camera is no longer under warranty so it's just collecting dust on a shelf (I hate to throw it away, it took good pictures, better than the Fuji S3100 I bought to replace it). It did last me 3 years, but I took great care of it and was hoping for several more years of use.---2007 Added info","For the money this camera is an excellent value.  My first digital was a FujiFilm FinePix A201, with only a 2.5 digital zoom and 2 mp, great for starters but I really didn't like any of the pictures taken with it.  I guess the magic is in the zoom, because the 2800 takes crystal clear, super sharp pics that I thought were only possible with either a 35 mm or a ridiculously-overpriced camera with 3 times the megapixels.  I like the 35 mm-style casing, it makes it look like a much more expensive camera, and of course FujiFilm's very simple to use menus.  The interface with my computer is quick and painless and I had a beautiful shot, from shutter to printed copy, in less than 5 minutes.  My only complaint so far has been the delayed shutter speed, not very good for taking pics of animals that don't stay still long, but I can live with this.  Others complain about the viewfinder being too dim indoors, and this is also true, but like another review pointed out, the film is cheap while you experiment.<br />For beginners who want professional-looking prints, this is the camera to use.","This is my first digital camera. It is a little big for a digital camera more comparable to a 35mm in size. It is simple to operate and even simple to download pictures on computer! That is one of the reasons I got it is to email pictures to friends and family, it is perfect for that. I keep it on the lowest megapixel setting to be able to email more pictures, otherwise it is too big to send. I purchased a 128 mb card and have taken more than 200 pictures with still more room available!<br />The only negative area is the ability to see what you are taking a picture of in low light setting. You just have to aim and shoot and hope you didn't cut off anyones head! Make sure to use the auto focus or your pictures will be off focus! Found that out the hard way! Not good for action shots, You miss the picture by the time you focus and take the picture. Someone needs to make an affordable camera that takes action pictures better.<br />The zoom is AWESOME!!! It makes editing even better!<br />The next digital camera I would get would be smaller and I would want quicker shutter speed. Other than that I think this camera is great!!!","Howdy again folks.  I have to say that this Camera is worth its gold.  I bought two 2800's for Xmas on Ebay and another dealer, and I like to say that I tested the cameras (after they were opened) and after testing the longevity of the batteries, I will say the batteries last and long time, compared to some digital cameras that eat batteries for lunch (Canon A60 for example.  My friend and my sister both loved the little camera and said it was so cute, and there friends loved the smallness.<br />The quality of the pictures are great, considering that it is a 2.0 MP camera.  But with Fuji film, they almost always make pictures sharper then what they should be.  I will always give thumbs up for Fuji film for its picture quality, no matter the MP limit.<br />I will have to say, even though this camera is small and cute, its not meant for putting in your pocket or shirt pocket (unless you want this big lump on your chest).  But that would be my only complaint.  I haven't tested this camera for dropping (since everybody always drops there camera at one time or another). But judging from the design of the camera, if you drop on the sides, you are fine, but I don't know what would happen I you dropped it on its front.<br />Movie mode is nice.  The sound is vibrant, and the speaker picks up little things that you might not catch normally.<br />Other then that, good camera.  Highly recommend for outdoors and reliabilty.","Well what can I add on the subject of this camera.<br />It looks good, performs good, and by God it is good for the price.<br />I bought mine after a lot of searching on the net regarding reviews.<br />By the way mine was bought in Hong Kong and a lot of dealers tried to upgrade me to a more expensive one but I stood firm as this was my first digital camera.<br />I have had it just over one year now and thought I would upgrade to a more expensive one, but changed my mind because this does what I want it to do with great results and is a good friend to me as a novice.<br />By the way the finepix software is also very good for a learner to get by with.<br />No camera case at this price is no big deal either, along with a 6* zoom and 60 secs of movie with sound why sell on as it will be missed as the first you have tried?<br />Anyway mine will be given as a gift to a novice family person when I decide to part with it.<br />A word of warning is that this camera is small and clumsy to handle for a person with big hands like me, and I think one drop on a hard floor will see it off.<br />I use the neck strap for extra protection.<br />Forget the mentions of the little things like lcd light and no case.<br />At this price and a first digital camera Fuji have done a good job, and the pictures, well just WOW for a novice like me, and others to show friends.","I love this little gem. It is versatile, performant, lets you fine-tune all the settings or automate the whole picture-taking process. Powerful zoon, crystal-clear shots in Macro mode. There are a lot of features to play with. You gotta try it.","I got this camera from DELL as a mistake.  This camera is only 2.0 mega pix and the one they were going to send me is a 4.0 mega pix.  The sent me the new camera, a kodak easy share with 4.0 mega pix...I cannot tell the differance.  ALSO, I find the FinePix easy to use and has a 6x true zoom, unlike the kodak that has a 3x true zoom, then digital up to 10x.  So in other words, buy this one.  I just licked out and got both for the price of one.  One bad thing about the FinePix is that it takes batterys and cannot use other lenses, both suck if you are a camera nut.  The Kodak can take many new lenses and is rechargeable.","This camera is really cute. it has the look of a mini-camera but actually works great! the only bad thing is that there is a short delay between when you press the shutter button and when it actually takes the picture. Also, it needs a lot of extra memory because it only stores 30 pictures with the built in memory. The camera is easy to use and small and has the video feature which is very convienient. I would recommend the camera to beginners and amateurs looking for a cute, fun camera.","Excellent camera for anything but low light! Excellent results with the movie mode, which has sound. It will also playback movies with sound. can also replace a camcorder. I have had this camera for almost 2 years. 6X optical zoom is handy.","Though I still loved my camera till the day I killed it, you need to be careful with the extended lens. I set mine down on the seat in my boat and it fell while turned on, and the lens twisted, giving me ZOOM ERROR. It still takes pictures at non-zoom settings, but it will cost the price of a new camera to repair. So take it for what it's worth... just keep in mind that the long extended lens is a delicate item.<br />My next digital camera will most likely be a Fuji because you'll have a hard time beating the quality of photos that I've been printing up for almost a year now.","I wanted a digital camera to keep my folks and in-laws at bay with regard to frequent demands for pictures of their grand-daughters. The USB connection to the PC and the nice all-around FinePix software that this camera comes with, allows me to do that with no hassles. The software also can e-mail photos directly, and it automatically makes the photos a manageable file size for attachments. So, for example, a 300kb photo will e-mail as a 80kb photo and still retain great quality in the e-mail.<br />I was also looking for a camera that had decent optical zoom capability because we are often outdoors and I like the flexibility of close-in as well as wide shots. This camera has a very capable 6X optical zoom which I have enjoyed using.<br />Finally, as any parent of young children knows, it is really difficult to get them to sit still. This camera offers a 60-second video capability, which has often come in handy to capture my kids at play or doing something silly.<br />I have received a lot of compliments on the camera's images.<br />Some minor drawbacks - in dark conditions, the camera has trouble picking out images to auto-focus on. I get around this by pointing it a nearby light source that is roughly the same distance to the camera as my subject. In addition, there can be a maddening 1 to 2 second delay in capturing and saving an image. But you learn to live with it - and sometimes what you clicked on is not what you get in the image, but you get used to that, and many times the image you got is better than the original. Also, it is not slim enough to fit in a purse - so it usually goes at my side in a pouch or in a backpack.<br />Overall an excellent and highly recommended all-around digital camera.","I really can't say enough good things about this camera. I have used it in many different lighting situations. Including taking pictures of fireworks.  The macro feature is great. I have always loved taking experimental close ups of my flowers but was prohibited by the cost of film and developing. The camera does work longest and at its best with rechargeable nimh batteries but they too are worth the price.  Even if I choose to upgrade to a higher mp camera, I'll still keep this one. Its easy to use and a lot of fun.","I love it, I absolutely love it.<br />I have had the camera for just over 3 weeks.  I took it on vacation with me and never having read the instruction book<br />I was able to figure out how to use it in minutes.  Quality of photos is outstanding and the 6x zoom is increadable.  I took a lot of seascape photos as well as some beach shots and that zoom really came in handy.<br />I had no problems with the viewfinder as others stated they have, perhaps because I didn't take any night shots but inside shots were no problem.<br />What really surprised me was that it is not necessary to install the software that comes with the camera so long as you are running XP.  I simply plugged the up usb ports and XP found the camera, no program to mess with.<br />Even with all of these positive comments the reason I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the way the shutter button and the off/on button are located.  I continually pressed the off button instead of the shutter button  until I got used to it.<br />At this point in time I feel this is a great camera and for the price, I paid less than half of the going price, and I really rate it a 4.9","I've had this camara for a few months now and it takes great pictures!  Fantastic color.  The 6X zoom lens works fabulous.  The only downfall is it's operation in low light situations.  Your target is difficult if not impossible to seen through the electronic view finder and the flash doesn't always sense that it needs to go off.","This camera takes great outdoor photos and beautiful portraits. I recommend this camera to any amature photographer who is looking for a good camera with a low price. HAVE FUN!","Until now I have always been a die hard Nikon fan, but this Fuji has really impressed me. I get compliments all the time from people who sees the prints it makes, and when I let people borrow my camera, they always like it.<br /><br /> I bought this camera when it 1st came out, and paid $400+ for it. Even at that price, I have no regrets whatsoever about purchasing this gem of a camera. It is a perfect size, and takes beautiful pictures. I bought it mostly because it has a through-the-lens viewfinder, but I also enjoy all of the many features I wasn't even expecting. The macro feature is super. My home printer is not great, so when I want really good prints I take my memory card to my local Kit's Camera. The prints I get back are not grainy at all - they look just as good or better than the pics I take with my old Nikon 35mm SLR.<br /><br /> It is fully automatic, but also has manual overrides if you want to use them. The auto settings are usually great unless you're doing something artistic. You can even take pics indoors, and they will not look yellow. I take pictures of architectural models indoors, so a colorbalance feature was important for me.<br /><br /> VERY easy to use - much easier than most other digital cameras out there. You should also get a battery charger - it will save you money in the long run (only negative point about camera is that it goes through batteries quickly). I also bought a card reader, and it makes transferring the pics to my computer really easy. Card readers go for $20 at any electronics store, and plug into a usb port.<br /><br /> I think this camera is worth every penny I paid for it. I reccomend this model to anyone who wants the convenience of a digital and the clarity of a traditional 35mm SLR.<br /><br /> No Regrets!","I love this camera!  I recently used it at my sons kindergarten graduation and was the envy of the crowd.  A couple of people inquired as to what type of camera I was using.  I took both still and movie pictures.  My family loved the short films and pics that I was able to quickly send them via email.  This camera makes taking pictures fun again!  Good job Fuji.","this camera is an excellent choice for either your switch from a SLR or just as your first digital camera.  Its easy to use and has excellent quality.  The 6x optical zoom and digital view finder are great.  the digital view finder allows additional battery life instead of using the battery hungry LCD screen.  mpeg playbacks and sound bites are fantastic.  other cameras with these specs cost so much more.  this is a great buy.  just make sure you pick up some rechargeable batteries and a larger memory card before you start having fun.","I Purchased this camera late July 2002. I used it heavily through the holidays. It goes through a set of 4 batteries about every 16 to 20 mb of pictures give or take for flash or not. I bought a 128 mb card for it and it's good for 266 pics in the medium mode. I think I used 4 sets of batteries for the whole card.  I am very pleased with this camera. It is very user friendly. It takes high quality pics even on the medium setting. I print very nice 8x10 pics from this camera, 4x6 even better. Would I buy it again? You bet I would.","I love this small silver camera. It takes pictures with really high quality. I also bought 4 1200ma batteries and a 128m memory card for it. When I went out for a field trip the batteries lasted for more than 3 days. I took hundreds of pictures. Although I did not take pictures with the highest quality this camera can make, they look excellent. It is amazing. All I can say is that I made a right choice.","I love this small silver camera. It takes pictures with really high quality. I also bought 4 1200ma batteries and a 128m memory card for it (about $80).

Although I did not take pictures with the highest quality this camera can make (only 1megapixel), they look excellent with bright color. They are very sharp. It is amazing. All I can say is that I made a right choice.","Well I've taken about 150 pictures now and I am completely impressed. Picture perfect colors and crispness. LCD is hard to see in darker settings. In most settings pictures come out great. Even when zoomed in all the way, pictures are still sharp and clear. Dim flourescent lighting can produce dark pictures but other than that, it's a great camera. Get it if you can find it!","I went to several big name (and supposedly reasonably priced) electronics stores and found this camera priced...higher.  I got it here for almost [a lot] less than the big name places.  Some stores didn't have this model at all.  I love this camera!  Easy to use (my 11 year old can use it without help), it's compact and produces FABULOUS pictures.  I didn't care for all the extra software that got loaded onto my computer by the FinePix software program CD.  It doesn't even give you a choice as to whether you want all that extra stuff.  We just loaded it, then deleted what we didn't want.  Other than that little inconvenience, it's a great camera.","I love this camera. It's not another 2MP digital camera. It takes amazingly great picture with great color. This is my first digital camera, and I compared mine with my friends' camera, and this is definitely the best for the money.","I have had this camera for about 24 hours, so I hope I am not jumping the gun.  I have put it through all the tests, and this is a very remarkable camera.  Everything is easy to use, pictures are crisp, camera is nice and lightweight, USB connection was a snap (w/XP) and EXTREMELY fast compared to my last digital camera (a very nice surprise).  The reviewer from Arizona was doing something wrong, because I live in AZ as well, and as soon as I read her review I brought the camera out in the sun and the pictures came out awesome.<br />The reason the camera lost one star is because everything they say about low light or night photos is true.  Its the cameras only downfall.  The LCD and the viewfinder become useless.  More than likely, the autofocus won't work either.  If it wasn't for that, this camera would have gotten a 5 star rating.","We received this camera for a wedding present and it is absolutely wonderful.  The pictures are clear and defined, even in zoom.  It is also quite easy to operate and the size and shape of the camera make it comfortable to hold.  We paired it with a new HP photo printer and the images are equal to or better than that of 35mm.  Really!!","All I can say is that I love this little camera.  All of my friends envy that I can make simply excellent pictures with it.  Excellent optics.  Especially valuable is the 6x zoom feature.  The only thing that I miss is the ability to see objects in my camera when its dark (when you take a shot in a drak room you do not really see what you will picture). But it is manageable.","This is my 2nd digital camera. My first was the ephoto 780c by AGFA. No zoom, with just under 1mp, took decent pictures for a no frills camera. After dropping it one too many times, it was time to get a new camera. After reading a ton of reviews, I decided on Fuji's 2800.<br />When I first picked it up I thought it felt too light, almost toy like. This is no toy! Going from under 1mp to 2mp is a huge jump. The pictures are crisp, clear and with vibrant colors.<br />My only complaints are,1) the view finder/lcd is usless in low light. This makes taking pictures indoors or at night pretty much a guessing game. Very surprising coming from a camera of this caliber.And 2)you cannot preview the picture you just took and disgard it if you want before going on to the next picture. You'll have to change the setting, look for the picture and then delete it. If you aren't paying attention, you could erase the everything! Who wants to sift though a bunch of BAD pictures if you can get rid of them from the get go?!<br />Other than those 2 things, this camera rocks!","This camera was my first digital camera purchase.  My decision was between this Fuji and a Kodak that has received good reviews.  I'm glad I went with the Fuji.  I love the way this camera fits in your hand.  I haven't had any of the problems with the lens cap that other reviewers have mentioned.  It's a little quirky in low light coniditions, but I think almost all digital cameras are.  I also really like the video feature - and I actually use it!  Great camera.","I did a lot of research before making this purchase and read a lot of reviews. The most important feature in my book was the 6X optical zoom. The auto focus is right on and the pre-focus option, (holding the shutter button down halfway) is a nice touch. One of my friends was so impressed with mine that he ordered one yesterday, (and Amazon still has the best price). I must say that although the camera is everything I hoped it would be there are a couple minor details that can be a little bothersome.<br />I find that it is difficult to take action shots while using the zoom. Much like a Single Lens Reflex camera, when the shutter is released the viewfinder goes black (something I hadn't considered) so it is nearly impossible to track a moving target. With some practice however I found that with good lighting the photos are crisp and clear. As long as the camera is kept still, it performs well in low light conditions and the flash is more than adequate. I don't care for the software but that is just my opinion.<br />I suggest that you buy  a 128 MB card and some high capacity Nickel Metal Hydride batteries and charger. I used this camera every last week and I haven't changed them yet. I can't wait to take it on a hike this spring.<br />By far my biggest problem with the 2800 is that I don't get enough time with it since everyone else wants to use it ;)<br />Anyone who wants an easy to use camera that takes excellent photographs should consider this one first.","This is a super camera, so easy to use.  From out of the box to snapping pictures was a matter of minutes.  Install the software FIRST as instructed, then quickly plug in the USB cord, it will open the images, load them to a website, email them or your can send them to your harddrive.  It opens a fold in My Pictures for you.  You just check which pictures you want to keep and which you want to get rid of.  You have the option of keeping the images on the smart card or you can erase them.<br />So from box to shooting a few minutes, about 5 to install and reboot.  Second to plug in to the computer and instant pictures of SUPER quality.  I could not believe how sharp the images were.<br />You are able to chose to look threw the lens to set it up as with regular SLR.  Or you can compose by looking at the LCD image. Once the image is snapped it shows you a copy on the LCD viewer so you can see the shot. It has 6 times zoom and auto flash.  Even has microphone setting and you can take small movies with and play them in quick time.<br />Do recommend adding the 125MB smart card and you can snap till your hearts content!<br />This is just amazing for this price!","I've been putting off buying digital.  I liked my old trusty 35mm.  In December I bought the FinePix 2800 from Amazon. It is great indoors and out, snow/water/pets/people - it takes great pictures.  DO buy the rechargeable batteries and a back up set  They last much longer than the regular batteries, and the power cord for downloading is a necessity.  It was easy to learn how to operate it.  There is a slight difference in taking a picture of a moving object but I got the knack of it after a few photos.","If you want a great camera, amazing zoom, enough resolution and [inexpensive] memory - nothing can beat this camera.<br />Extremely simple to use, with very powerful features, it produces excellent images and consumes very little battery power - especially if you use NiMH batteries. It even works on Linux without a hitch. Can you ask for more?<br />Yes. It does not have manual high speed shutter controls. Bummer, but I can certainly live with it. This device rocks!","I am very pleased with all the features this camera offers. Very smart choice indeed. It has great zoom as well as close ups. I was able to take super sharp pictures of honey bees on the flowres. Consider adding more memory and a tripod for ultimate capacity and precision. With some mastering it takes special effect photos too. Go For it.","I had been researching digital cameras in the under [price] range for over 6 months. I wanted something with awesome resolution and something that catches color realistically. I finally found it in this little beauty. It defiantly had the \"most bang for your buck\".<br />I am so thrilled with the Fuji FinePix 2008Z and after having a lesser dig. camera several years ago, the technology has certainly improved by leaps and bounds. I am happy with my second digital camera. The range, versatility, ease of operation & dynamic colors can't be beat. I can't put it down! Plus the software that accompanies it is easy and helpful.<br />The only thing you need to look out for is lighting while using its nifty digital camera feature. Make sure you can get as much light on as possible while filming indoors or the 60 sec film looks terribly dark & bleak.<br />Other than that, the size is wonderful, (it fits very comfortably in hand); the sexy silver body is so darned cute I leave it out near my computer so I can look at it all the time! Don't worry about not liking this camera; I don't think it's possible.","This is a GREAT camera.  The comments about the dark viewfinder are true - it is very hard to see in low light.  The image is being viewed thru the lens, not thru a clear glass like non-electronic viewfinders.  Otherwise, the camera is exceptional.  Most all the controls are automatic, but this setting takes perfect pictures in all light situations.  FINALLY - a digital camera with a healthy zoom!!!","I did not have alot of knowledge about Digital Cameras but knew that it was time to try one.  After reading many reviews, I decided to go with this one based zoom capabilities, personal recommendations and of course, price (which was about $50 more when I bought it 6 months ago!) I had been using a nice little 35mm point and shoot and was afraid I would sacrifice the zoom and clarity. I have been very turned off by the grainy resolution of digital photos that my friends get from their digital cameras so I was PLEASANTLY surprised to see that I get NONE of that.  Especially when using my zoom lens - which limits how much cropping I would do. The only negative thing I can say about this camera is that taking pictures in dark or very dim lighting is difficult because of the EVF which is not a lens that you can view through.  The pictures still come out okay, but you have to see them after taking the picture.  The size and shape of the camera took some getting used to but I absolutely love it now.... Also, I have found that it is more cost effective to take my smartmedia out to print my photos or upload them to an online photo center.  You would never know that the 4x6 prints are from a digital camera, and that's what I wanted.<br />I do reccommend a 64mb smartmedia or larger (2 64s would be ideal!) Video takes up alot of space. NIMH rechargeables are a must.","I take pictures with this camera for my personal use and for my website and works great!  The color and resolution in the photos are excelent. The 6X Optical Zoom made the photos clear and brilliant and the movie feature it's ok for a digital camera. I use a lot the feature bonus (Webcam) to videoconference and is a great plus. This camera worth the price.","Just received my camera and could not wait to start taking pictures. Nicely packaged and easy to get out of the box. Once out of the box it was easy and quick to learn how to use my new Fuji. I started with some inside photos and then some outside photos, and I could not beleive the quality of the pictures. When I transfered them to my CPU I was quickly emailing photos to family and friends of all the snow. The zoom brought some birds eating in the snow way closer than my old Cannon ever could. Even though that is and always will be a great camera. I recommend the 64 MB smart card even though I never exceeded the 16 MB capacity. I cannot wait to take the camera to a sports event and get some great pictures. Way to Go FUJI, great camera for the money.","OK, in a nutshell- This camera takes great quality photos rich in color. The detail really does rival that of higher MP cameras.<br />Much of this can be attributed to two factors. First, the 6X Optical zoom allows the photographer to bring the shot to them without the distortion that is caused by a Digital zoom. Second, the lens Aperture, the size of the lens opening, is by far the largest of any digital camera I have seen in this price range. This large aperture gives the camera a greater light gathering ability and contributes to vivid color reproduction.<br />The camera's case is made of plastic, which may seem flimsy to some, and will probably scratch if not handled carfully. If you plan on accompanying the 'crock hunter' on an outback photoshoot any time soon, I recommend finding a camera with a metal casing.<br />The on-screen menus are logical and easy to navigate. The menus can be seen via the LCD (display screen) or the EVF (viewfinder). This camera has many amatuer features and they all work great. The movie feature has decent quality video (for a digicam) and good sound.<br />Because the viewfinder is electronic and it's source is the zoom lens, this camera is effectively a digital SLR, which means that the image you see is exactly the image you get -a great plus.<br />Considering this cameras large aperture lens, it is surprising that this camera's main drawback is it's display performance in low light situations. Both the LCD and EVF are useless at night, and indoor shots may become difficult under low light conditions. This may make it difficult to take advanced shots, as it may be impossible lock the focus on your subject properly. The flash will ensure that the pictures come out great, though, and its not like your wasting film if your subject isn't centered properly. Just fire away! Still its a major shortfall.<br />Software works fine, but you may want to use something you're more familiar with.<br />Get a set of Nickel Metal Hydride rechargable batteries. The higher the mAh the better as this determines how long the batteries will last per charge. I have found a set of 1800mAh batteries and they work great.","Purchased this camera after weeks of searching for the best deal.  The general consensus is that the camera performs poorly in low-light situations which is true however my experience leads me to believe that it's the type of light that the camera is picking up.  Regular incandescent bulbs are for somereason hard for the camera to pick up while the same low light in a flourescent bulb is picked up very well.<br />I began using the camera immediately upon arrival without so much as opening the instruction manual.  Camera receives 5 stars for ease of use.  The pictures are superb, clear, clean and vibrant.  Batteries do run down very quickly so I do recommend purchasing rechargeable which can be done very inexpensively.<br />The options found on this model including the 6x optical zoom are a great bargain.  Other than low light performance you will not be dissatisfied with your purchase.","This camera takes excellent photos in all quality (image size) settings.<br />Downloads are easy and the program offers a slide presentation which is useful when viewed by a large group.<br />My only complaint is that this little unit is power hungry.  Alkalines and rechargeable last about the same amount of time allowing 30 - 50 shots depending on shooting mode (flash vs. no flash).","I was so excited when I first got this camera in the mail. I was impressed with how simple it was to use and the amenities it offered. And then I tried to use it inside. Under normal lighting conditions. That's when my excitement turned to disappointment. The electronic viewfinder and the LCD came out very dark, almost to the point that you couldn't see what it was you were taking a picture of. No matter how much light I added, it wasn't enough. Oddly, it did not suffer under flourescent light (I found out when I went to the store to see if it was just my camera or what). Since I bought a digital camera to use primarily for snapshot purposes, I needed it to be suitable in snapshot conditions. To its credit, the pictures turned out fine with the flash and even with a little longer exposure, but not being able to see clearly what I was shooting in the beginning was very frustrating. The electronic viewfinder doesn't leave you with any way to get around the darkness, as a glass viewfinder would. The problem with the dark scenes was too much for me. I returned this camera and opted for one with a glass viewfinder to be safe! Aside from this problem, I would have loved this camera, but it was too big a problem to ignore or work around for me.","Best photo quality and features for the cost I've seen yet!<br />Small, lightweight, easy to use and long battery life. I saved almost $100.00 over \" Discount Store \" prices at Amazon!<br />Only two drawbacks that I've noticed are; 1. The image in the electronic viewfinder freezes for a second while focusing.<br />2. Having to navigate through menus to do most things like macro shots. But these are minor and easy to get used to.<br />Put this camera together with a 128 Mb Smart Media card and Ni-MH rechargeable batteries and you've got one heck of a unit. I'm loving every shot!!","I'll keep this review short and sweet.  As a bit of background, I have been shooting and developing my own 35mm film for the past 29 years (strictly as a hobbyist), shooting mostly with older, manual-focus Olympus and Canon SLR's. I purchased both this camera and the Canon Powershot A40 from Amazon in the summer of 2002.  I definitely prefer the Fuji.  Why?<br />1) Superior optics (in my humble opinion).  I shot dozens of pics<br />  of the same subject matter, at the same distance, with the same<br />  focal length and lighting within seconds of each other in order<br />  to compare the results side-by-side.  The Fuji pics were in all<br />  cases noticably sharper and more accurately exposed.  Colors<br />  with the Fuji were also more accurate, and with better<br />  saturation.  Shadow details are better w/the Fuji also.<br />2) Macro capabilites.  The Fuji's focusing distance in macro mode<br />  is closer than that of the Canon A40 and again, the Fuji<br />  produced sharper, more accurately exposed pics.<br />3) Focal length.  The Fuji wins hands down with a 6x optical zoom<br />  versus the Canon's 3x optical zoom.<br />4) Ease of use.  Again, the Fuji has the edge.  Simpler operation<br />  (especially for novices and casual users)than the Canon, though<br />  admittedly lacking some of the Canon's more advanced features/<br />  options.<br />Don't get me wrong, the Canon Powershot A40 is a decent camera and offers manual operation, which the Fuji does not (albiet in a somewhat limited manner with only a couple of shutter speeds available when shooting manually).  I would also say that the Canon's low-light, night shot capabilities are superior to those of the Fuji as long as you're using a tripod.  Canon's photo stitch technology is also a nice touch for super-wide panorama shots.  Those pluses aside, I feel the Fuji FinePix 2800 is the overall superior camera for the reasons I have stated above and should be on your short list if you're looking for a simple to use, point-and-shoot digital camera capable of taking razor-sharp pics at a reasonable price.  Add to that the only 6x optical zoom in it's class, and you just can't do better than the Fuji.<br />Now what was that I was saying about keeping this short and sweet?  ;)","Love the camera. Easy to use. Takes great quality photos. However it is Awful in low light conditions and if I had to do everything again that would make me look elsewhere.","I have found this little camera to be a GREAT buy...<br />My pictures are clear and detailed, close ups are<br />\"Fantastic\"........I would highly recommend this<br />product...!!!","I didn't want anything fancy, so I didn't feel like shelling out the $999.99 required for most of the \"good\" digital cameras out there. I think I lucked out with this unit. I've had it for about three months now and love it. Wonderful colour, convenient and as versatile as I need it to be. Sure, as other reviews have stated, the LCD is a little dim (or black) in low-light conditions, but I can deal with it. If I'm desperate to take a picture in the dark I'll use my tripod, shine a light on the scene to get proper focusing, and off I go. By the way, I've been able to get fantastic dusk/night shots with a tripod.<br />I can't complain about the picture quality - sure, it's not as good as other cameras, but I doubt I'll ever look back and regret having used this camera to document my year.","+ easy shooting on automatic mode.<br />+ clear and sharp photo<br />+ video recording with sound.<br />+ with speaker (watch and listen video file)<br />- manual mode is less.<br />- bad focusing in night shoot.","I love the design of this camera. It fits perfectly in your hands! The interace on it is easy to understand, too - even without reading the manual, and I love the zoom lens capabilities. You can close in on your subject's relatively quickly... I took it out shooting wildlife photos and the images were extremely clear and  professional despite the animal's movements and the overcast sky. I do have three issues with this model, however.<br />1) the placement of the on/off button and the shutter are easily confused.

I'd love to know how.<br />Thanks!","My husband and I looked at reviews and digital cameras for almost a year before I finally just bought this camera.  I have had it for almost 2 months now, and I haven't picked up our regular camera since.  The menu is easy to surf and the quality of the pics is very good.  I like to take pictures of the birds visiting our backdeck, and the zoom lens lets me get right up to them.  The only drawback that I see for this camera is the pause before the actual shot is taken.  That took a bit of getting used to.  I have 5 year old daughters who have learned to hold their smile for a brief second more before relaxing.  I have taken lots of pictures of butterflies, birds, zoo animals and children with this camera, and I have been very happy with the results.  It is especially nice to have a camera where you can view the picture right after taking it, and see if you need another shot.<br />I would definitely recommend getting a larger memory card.  I got a good deal on a 64 mb card on Amazon[.com] when I purchased our camera, and it has plenty of room for us.  I would also recommend buying rechargeable batteries and charger.  We got a 1 hour charger that is great.<br />Have fun picture taking!","with the 128MB smartmedia card at 1280x960 resolution, you get an amazing 398 photos before having to clear off the card. at 640x480 rez, you get almost a thousand photos. the features on this camera are like having an slr without having to deal with film and developing. an awesome camera!","I've had this Fuji 2800 camera for about 1 month now and I simply LOVE it. I took it on my recent trip to Key West Florida where I got some FANTASTIC quality shots. Zoom works wonderfully, but be very careful on full zoom... even the slightest movement will result in blurry pictures. The 6X zoom is why I bought the camera, and I quickly learned the difference between the digital zoom and optical zoom. The optical zooms in physically (you feel the lens move) while the digital gets you closer like on the monitor of a computer. Every time I zoomed to the full max, I set the camera on a stable surface and got incredibly nice photos!<br />My suggestion is to buy a 128MB card, or two, and take all your pictures at the highest quality. Your choices for quality are BEST / High, mid, low... or MEDIUM / high, mid... or LOW / regular. That's 6 choices. If you have the space available on your card, why not get the best shot? The camera comes with a 16MB, I bought a 64MB, and on my week in Fla., I ended up lowering the quality to accommodate more photos, and when I viewed my pics at home, I saw a difference that didn't please me. If I had taken them all at mid quality, I may not have noticed, but size does matter! Capture the biggest image!<br />As far as the video clip capabilities, I was pleasantly surprised. Takes up tons of space though. And don't expect fine detail. Add the sound and you end up with a jumpy at best, rough video of your cherished moment. If it's video you're after, take along a video camera. I did run home and e-mail the .avi file to all my friends and they were surprised too, simply at the fact that a digital camera can record video with sound.<br />I have used several other digi-cameras that were slim and credit card sized, and I didn't like them. I am a big guy with big fingers, and I like the bigger camera. I can carry it in my front pocket in relative comfort, but then again, I wear big shorts. The camera is 3\" x 3.5\" x 3.5\". A cube. It has a nice grip to it, and it feels secure in my hand when I am on the boat. It comes with a lanyard for hanging on your neck but I never attached it. The lens cap is on a string, so be careful the string is out of the way when you snap the shot. My last digital camera had no lens cover, and the lens got scratched eventually.<br />As far as not being able to see through the viewfinder at night or indoors, it is true, but you can almost always see something distinguishable, and in no time, one gets used to it. You see the captured image for a second after you snap it, so you can see if you cut someone's head off. The biggest problem is when you ask someone to take your picture for you, they get caught up on the fact that they can't see you clearly. Better off just using the self-timer, which is easy to use. I use it often.<br />Pictures are easily and quickly erased if you want to erase them. So easy though, you can erase ones you didn't want to! There is no `undo' button... once they're gone, they're gone.<br />One more feature I fell in love with is the suppressed flash. It allows you to take pictures of cityscapes, sunsets, etc., where there is a subject in front. I took a picture of my wife in front of one of those fabulous Key West sunsets, and it turned out incredibly. I took another of her in front of downtown San Francisco at night, and it too came out awesome.<br />I have read people suggesting the AC adapter, but I see no reason to buy one. A full 128MB card can be downloaded into your computer within 2 minutes, maybe less. The camera, when turned on, automatically opens the image software, but several times in that process, my system has malfunctioned (Win98). I remedied it by simply opening the FinePix viewer first, then turning on the camera. Pictures pop right up, then I select them all, and drag them to another folder. Since pictures on a Smartmedia card are numbered from 0001 to the last, the folder should be empty, otherwise the computer tries to replace like-named pictures. As soon as they're moved, turn the camera off! It's that simple. DO buy some rechargeable batteries. Digital cameras can eat up disposable ones fast.<br />This Fuji 2800 camera is the best buy for your buck, hands down.","I am still learning all the aspects of my Fugi...and in most ways I have been very pleased. Picture clarity and the zoom is very good. I have noticed some trouble with reds and oranges coming out too dark. I am very dissapointed that what you want to capture while zooming is rarely what comes out, due to the delay in pressing the button and it taking the picture. Maybe with practice that will improve, I hope so.  Well, after spending more time with my camera, I am now able to give it higher ratings.  If you follow their directions about taking zoom photos, you can capture what you are trying to without missing much in the process.  Pictures are clear and sharp.  I still think reds and oranges are a bit off, but overall the camera is excellent.","This camera is perfect for the amatuer photographer who would like to own a nice camera that takes beautiful photographs with stunning clarity!","The camera works fine other than in low light conditions where the image isn't visible in either the viewfinder or the lcd display. Don't make the mistake I made and buy a FLASH CARD. I thought this would increase the memory and it did not fit this camera. If you want memory purchase a memory card. Since I opened the card package and returned it, I'm sure it will be a costly mistake. If I were to do it all over again I would buy the Fuji 4800 for a few bucks more.","I have had the camera for 6 weeks and have taken several hundred photos, mainly of the America's Cup qualifying races in Auckland.<br />One reviewer complained that the power button and shutter are easy to confuse. I fully agree, and have lost a couple of action shots through the confusion. My biggest problem is with the physical strength of the camera. I was taking pictures from a boat, and the lens gently nudged a bulkhead. This was a gentle nudge, but enough to dislodge the lens, which fell off completely when I shut the power down. The Fuji distributor in Auckland was fantastic, and repaired the camera promptly, and without charge. It was not the first time they had seen the problem, so be warned! I have a 64meg card, and this is more than enough.","After having been used to manual professional cameras (35 mm and medium format) and being very picky about results, I was extremely reluctant towards digital photography. However, this little camera has not disappointed me. It does everything extremely well that it is said to do, and I was stunned by the beautiful results when viewing them on my computer.Now I wonder why I had not done this sooner. I can highly recommend this little powerhouse to anybody who is doubtful about switching to digital. I have, and there are NO REGRETS! Go for it!","I was wowed by what this camera can do for the price. It is so easy to use. It is a bit finiky over procedure to download the pictures but that is all that I have found to be hard to deal with. It is so small and light wieght which is good. It takes some great 60sec movies, and the sound that it captures is great. I would recommend that you buy an extra memory card so that you can take lots of pictures. This camera is good for the beginer to the semi advanced. You can definetly grow with this camera. Mac users will love the ease of this camera. The best camera that I found for the price.","I bought this camera before my trip to Australia because I really liked how it felt and the quality of the pictures it took.  Everything was going pretty well with it until suddenly, it can't take a good picture when the flash is required.  Something is wrong with the sensor.  So now any evening or night time pictures are extremely fuzzy or blurry which really puts a damper on how I can document this trip.<br />I have a couple other problems with it:<br />*It is a little larger than most cameras, and even though it is pretty light and the zoom compacts down pretty far and it is comfortable to use, it is cumbersome in the fact that it doesn't fit easily into a small purse, and it is hard to find a small case for it.<br />*It isn't the easiest camera to use, so if you want people to take a picture of you, often times you will find yourself explaining the camera and how it works for a few minutes before you finally get around to taking the photo.<br />*If you are using the higher quality mode on the camera, it often takes awhile for the camera to save it, which is annoying because you have to wait before you can take another.<br />But a plus of this camera is how well it captures light and color.  It can take pictures of sunsets that are absolutely amazing.  The camera makes the sunset look ten times prettier than it actually was.<br />If there wasn't something wrong with the flash on this camera I would probably give it a four, maybe even five stars, but I am fored to wait until I return home from this country until i can get it fixed, which is really annoying.","This camera was my second digital camera The reason I bought the Fuji 2800 was its small size and it's rather extraordinary 6X optical zoom.  I have taken both cameras with me on trips and have found that they perfectly compliment each other.  The Fuji is available for those quick shots and can be used as a point and shoot<br />  The Fuji 2800 is a great camera that is simple to operate and has the ability to take a picture that will print out sharply at 8 x 10.  It has a very good autofocus and the 6X zoom will let you get in close.  The flash has 6 different modes and there is also a white balance feature.  You can choose from a variety of resolutions but I normally keep it on the highest 2 megapixel setting (with a 64 mb card I can shoot about 80 pictures).<br />  On the down side, the view finder is poor in low light conditions; the autofocus still works ok, you just can't compose your shot with the view finder.  Action shots are also a bit tricky due to the electronic viewfinders quirk of freezing the view during autofocusing.<br />  Other than that, this is an extemely competent camera that takes great pictures, is simple to use, and offers great features at an affordible price.","I just got it last week and have taken more than a hundred pictures. Beautiful color recovery and nice focus. Some problems at low light condition for view finder but fine for a digital camera since you can take as much as you want and delete them if you do not like them. Flash gives good compensation in dark, so the quality of picture is not affected. You need to press the shutter half way down to focus but it is a nice feature for me since if the lense is covered in the photography mode, the camera does not try to focus on nothing which bothers me a lot when I was using a olympus with aoto focus. One of my friend who just got a SONY S85 highly appraised it since the color and image are much better from fuji 2800 with ... less on the price tag. Highly recommend for people who want to get a nice point and shoot digital camera.","Has any one notice the confussion between the shutter & power buttons??<br />Or is it only me???<br />I keep hitting the power (off) button when I want to take a picture, therefore loosing the picture.<br />Good thing I haven't tried to take \"once in a life time\" photos yet.<br />This is my only real complaint, enough for me to return the camera.<br />I rate 3 stars due to the power button, 5 stars for everything else<br />Otherwise I agree with everyone els that this has great features and photo quality, for the price","I purchased this camera in haste with a vacation pending and little time to shop around. I wanted something compatible with the Smart Media cards I already had from an earlier Fuji camera. The 2 MP file size is ideal, giving an perfect balance of image quality and quantity.<br />Pluses:<br />Shape of the camera -- fits in the hands like a conventional 35mm SLR camera (although smaller). This is helpful for those who are used to using 35mm cameras and don't adapt well to some of the funky new digital camera shapes that are available today. Also can be held with one hand if desired.<br />6X Lens -- Great range, allowing for perfectly framed pictures of most subjects.<br />Simplicity -- not much here to complicate matters.<br />EVF -- it is nice to know you will be taking an image of exactly what you frame up in the view finder, however...<br />Minuses:<br />Low light performance of EVF -- There is no way around it, the Electronic View Finder does not function well in low light (like during an evening wedding reception). Leave the camera on a wide angle, point and shoot, and review the image. Repeat as necessary.<br />Lens cover leash is too short -- When the camera is turned on the lens extends out a bit. The lens cover leash can get caught around the corner of the camera body, inhibiting the lens from extending during startup.<br />Auto focus \"freeze frame\" -- When depressing the \"shutter\" slightly the camera auto focuses on the subject inside of two yellow brackets in the EVF. The camera freezes the image for a split second, temporarily blinding you from your subject. If your subject has moved you will have to re-focus. This has an up side to it though -- the freeze frame gives you a split second to review the part of the image the camera is focused on. As long as you don't let up on the \"shutter\" button the camera will remained focused on that part of the subject. This allows you to focus on subjects that aren't in the middle of the frame, by pointing the camera and locking the auto focus directly at the part of the image you want as the primary subject, and then reframing the image so you subject isn't always in the dead center. This makes for good picture composition.<br />Overall, this is a great value in the ever changing world of digital cameras.","After an exhaustive review of camera's in the ... price range to replace my lost Olympus D-100, I chose the Fuji FinePix 2800 mostly for the 6x zoom. Some of the review had me worried about certain aspects of the camera, but I went ahead and bought it.<br />I was VERY pleasantly surprised when I recieved the camera. The 6x zoom works very well, and the camera is a joy to use. It's not perfect, but the features (and price) far outweigh the negatives for me.<br />Pluses:<br />- 6x Zoom<br />- Great color and image.<br />- USB camera port works flawlessly with Linux for image transfer.<br />- 60 second movies with sound.<br />  This is the one that surprised me. I knew about the ability<br />  to take short movies, but the reality is much better than<br />  than I thought it would be. It reminds me of the old<br />  Super8 home movies my grandparents used to take.<br />Minuses:<br />- No active autofocus. Autofocus doesn't do well in low light.<br />- Lenscap instead of door to protect lens.<br />- LCD viewfinder. Actually, it works pretty well, even in lowish<br />light situations, if you turn up the brightness setting. I had many more problems with the autofocus. But the viewfinder does take getting used to, and the pause in the viewfinder screen during autofocus is a bit annoying.<br />I haven't had any problems with it eating batteries, since I bought some good high capacity NiMH rechargables. The camera is somewhat short and squat which makes finding a camera bag challenging, but it is comfortable to hold due to a nice right hand grip.<br />All in all, it's a great little camera at a great price. The 6x zoom and image quality is worth the price, and the mini-camcorder feature is just icing on the cake. The autofocus can be annoying sometimes when indoors, but other than that I love this camera.","Have had this camera for nearly 6 months and it has taken some fabulous shots. For the price tag that it comes in at - it is a neat buy. Also the 6x zoom (which was the feature that made me buy it) is just perfect (for me). On the downside it seems to have problems in low-light conditions (as almost all digital cameras do) and that is an area which leaves some things to be desired. Also since the 6x zoom is not stabilized you can use it only in the best of lighting conditions.<br />All in all a great value for money and a good buy for enthusiasts who do not want all manual controls but do desire a lot more zoom power.","This is my 1st digital camera.  I probably read too many reviews by disgruntled camera buffs.  I've had it for a few days and love this thing.  It takes great pictures and is very easy to use.  Even on 1MP setting, I was able to take  sharp and colorful photos for printing at home.  The EVF is not a big deal, just have at least one light on if shooting indoors at night.  Get a card reader for your computer, rechargeable batteries, and your set!  I am very happy with my purchase, and excellent price from Amazon.","Nice unit, It is not only great to be taking pictures again, but with this camera it is great fun. I researched digital cameras extensively before I purchased this one. Within Five minutes I was taking great pictures. It was very easy to figure out how to use it. I just kept saying \"WoW\" every time I downloaded another picture.","I didn't have time to conduct any special surveys or waste time at computer stores. Luckily, I bumped into this cool digital from FujiFilm and got excited. This piece is great, very small yet powerful and of great quality. Images are sharp, even on low-mode, the 60 sec video option is great and the web-cam ability is even cooler.<br />Installation on WinXP is a snap, menus and configurations are pretty straight forward. I personally didn't look at the manual AT ALL.<br />This is a great camera for your money! Be sure to include re-charging batteries and another memory card at your purchase. Both gets empty pretty fast.<br />And no, I don't work for Fuji :)","We bought this camera as an upgrade from our first digital which was only 0.8 megapixels.  This camera takes awesome pictures and the flash card makes downloading a snap.  We have an HP Photosmart printer that the card just pops into and reads as a removable drive, so we don't even need the USB connector.  The pictures are very clear and the menus on the screen are easy to use.  I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone!","I have never written a review and am a true digital novice so I will stick to the basics. I bought this camera because I liked the way it felt in my hand. Also my son has an older fuji digital that has taken some great pictures with less resolution so I thought this would be a great starter camera. I used it for the first time at a wedding and it did take great pictures outdoors and indoors but and this is the big one, in low light and darker (the all important decorating of the car) you can NOT see anything on the screen or in the viewfinder. I found myself pointing and shooting blindly. Amazingly the pictures turned out ok, not well lit but ok, but it is my major complaint. Other than that, I have found it easy to use and I found myself taking alot more pictures and I think that is the whole idea.","Its excellent value for money. The 6x zoom is awesome.<br />But those are looking for more creative control over shutter and aperture, etc. this is not the camera for you. It only gives manual control over exposure value and white balance. Although by playing around with these values you can take some excellent shots too.","I've been a photo hobbyist for Several years . Have owned several 35mms with a new Nikon my latest purchase just 2 years ago. Was not a big fan of digital but was sold when in the carribean and saw a realtime comparison of several different cameras. I SOLD !<br />Very easy to use right away, great, clear images. Love everything about it. Sorry I didn't buy one earlier. I still love my 35. but now have a new traveling companion.","Yes, it is a great little camera if you limit your shooting to the outdoors or well lite indoor locations. If you're thinking of taking this to a wedding or some other indoor affair, forget it, unless you want to estimate the location of your subject or keep your other eye open to try and compose a decent shot and then go back to the view finder, all the time hoping the party hasn't ended in the meantime.<br />I would have given it 5 stars except for this terrible and practically non-functional view finder in low light.","I have just purchased the Fuji 2800 2MP,  which is my first digi camera, and I'm having a whale of a time ,being able to email the shots to all my mates the same minute is really a bonus. The only down fall I can say is that you can't show the pic's via the TV, as is has no AV ports built in which would be positive advantage, so you show them via the usb port on your home computer,and then plug in AV cable from there to your TV, but say you visit someone who in this year 2002 has not got a computer at home, what then!!!easy huddle around the camera, it's cosy","This camera is an excellent value for the price. The 6X zoom is very useful and lets you take high-quality photos from any reasonable distance.<br />I read complaints about low-light situations, but have had only two photos that disappointed me and that may have been because I might have suppressed the flash.<br />It is a lumpy little camera, and finding a carry case required some looking, but I found one that works and I take the camera everywhere. You have to get used to holding it, because of the funny shape, but that is easilly learned.<br />Battery life is quite acceptable on JPEG settings, which I use a lot because it makes E-mailing pics better for down-load time to my friends. My first pic was of my garden on 2M setting. My friends on dial-up chewed me out because it took over 2 minutes to download. For prints and blow-ups, though, this is a wonderful setting, though it uses a lot of memory. I also conserve batteries by using the viewfinder for most applications instead of the screen.<br />I suggest buying an extra set of rechargable NiMh bateries and keep them available.<br />I bought an after-market card reader to conserve batteries at Radio-Shack for [a reasonable price].<br />I would like to see polarizer filters and IR filters available to help with hazy outdoor conditions.<br />It is pretty much point-and-shoot for most situations, but there are a lot of nice features I plan to learn how to use soon.<br />I would like clearer markings on the battery box for us old folks to read better.","This is my first digital camera and I must say I'm impressed. The only downside I can see for this camera is the poor visibility on the LCD display in low light conditions. If you can work around that though this is a great camera for the price.","This is my second digital camera, my first being an early model Kodak DC210 Plus model. The Kodak is a fine camera, but I was attracted to the 6X optical zoom and increased resolution of the FinePix 2800. I also did not want to pay an exoribitant price. After reading a number of reviews, I decided to give this camera a try. I have used it for a little more than two weeks and have been overjoyed with its performance. It is small, light, has plenty of features and the zoom performance is excellent. I could not find anything similar in this price range.  For a beginner or amateur photographer, I don't think you could ask for a better camera. It is simple to set up, has a wide variety of picture quality settings, plenty of options/features and is just pleasure to use. I also liked the built in USB interface (USB cable and software included). I would have liked to have seen an AC power supply included, but for the price I can't complain about the included accessories. I purchased a 128M SmartMedia card with the unit and can get over 350 pictures in the 2M Normal mode, which gives great resolution. This unit also seems to be a lot faster than the Kodak I own. The 2800 also supports video and voice over, although I have not tried either of these features. For video, I use my Canon ZR25M. With no reservations, I rate the FinePix 2800 as an exceptional camera and very reasonbly priced. I highly recommend it.","We have had the Fugi FinePix 2800 for 2 weeks now and am still getting familiar with all the features. It takes the most clear and crisp pictures we have ever seen. There is no need to touch up anything. It is very EASY to operate. It's smaller and lighter than I had antisipated. We also purchased the rechargable batteries and charger and upgraded to a 32mb memory card. This was also a great idea. I would suggest getting the bag, too. This is the best investment we've made in a long time!","I recently purchased this camera and have found it to be everything that I need with one big exception.  I find it difficult to view the image that I am trying to include in the picture with either the viewfinder or the LCD display.  This is especially true when there is dim light or there is dark objects around the subject. Otherwise, the images are sharp, the memory that comes with the camera exceeds that of most cameras and with the additional memory that I purchased I can take more than enough pictures even at the highest resolutions.","I spent way too much time deciding which digital camera to purchase.  But if I'm going to spend $500+ on a product that I want to keep for a long time, I'd better make the right decision the first time.  I looked at the Fuji Finepix 2800 Zoom and a few of the popular 3mp cameras.  I was very leary to get the 2mp over the 3mp but figured with the 6x zoom and the way lower price that it may have an advantage.  Let me tell you, I made the right decision.  Here's why:<br />Photo Quality:  Incredible.  Better than I could have hoped for.  More than enough.  You can't crop down to nothing, but I printed a few 8X10's and it looked like an actual photograph.  2mp is enough for me.  PLUS, you usually don't even set the camera on the 2mp setting anyway, 1mp is usually plenty.<br />Controls:  The automatic controls are very accurate.  I have used a 35mm Nikon SLR for years and it's nice not to have to fuss with all the manual settings.  This is primarily my wife's camera anyway and she appreciates just being able to point and shoot.  You do have to get used to the 1/2 second delay, but it's not a big deal and common with digital cameras.<br />Viewfinder/LCD - Yeah its dark in low light, but you can still see an outline of your subject in most cases; unless its really dark, but I haven't had much of a problem and the one time I did get my 1 year old out of center I just took another shot.<br />Overall - I'm very happy with this camera.  I can't say enough.  If you're leary about this camera like I was, don't be, it will exceed your expectations.  Oh by the way the web cam feature works great too.  Oh and make sure to get rechargeable batteries, and ac adapter for web cam and download and you'll be set.<br />PS - I estimated that I saved about $200 by going with this camera over some of the other 3mp and in my opinion it can't be beat.","1. I bought this camera 2 weeks ago. I love it. Considering its price, the optical 6x zoom is very attractive while digital zoom will decrease your resolution. Fuji's color is so vivid, I think no one will be disappointed by its quality, --- I took many photes of flowers(with macro mode), birds(with opt.zoom), and my kid's lovely face,... they are almost 1st-level quality.<br />2.This price is only for 2M. Maybe, 3-5M camera is sure better considering the resolution while they often require more dollars. I think pay 250--350$ for top-level 2M digital camera is a good idea because our printer today is in such a level. One who need higher resolution may buy this one now and buy another 3-5M camera in next year, ---- I think totally you pay the same money for 2 cameras compared with buying one 3-5M camera today.<br />Further more, a 3M camera with 3x optical will down to 2M or even less resolution if it has to use digital zoom while 2800 can keep its 2M level with 6x Opt.zoom.  That's why 2800 is [more] than 2600. That's why 2800 stands the top-level 2M digital camera.<br />3.Many complained that the dark viewer. I do not think it is a problem. In fact all the cameras with such kind of viewer have this problem ( not only Fuji). I took some photos at night and they are all OK.<br />4.I have a complain: Fuji should include charger/re-chargable cells/AC-adapter in the package even they raise the price a little bit. it is a joke that they put AA-cells into the package because no one will really use one-time-cell as a power source in such a camera.  So, to do  something convenient for customers, ---- my words to Fuji.<br />I bought it after many days' comparation serfing online. I mark 2800 highest with price and function balance.<br />Generally, this is a good camera for us to buy in this year.<br />I do like it. If I had to choose once more, I would like to focus on it once more.","This is a great camera for the price.  I was looking for a camera with movie mode (I don't own a digital camcorder), and really wanted sound with it.  I didn't need a ton of manual options.  I wasn't planning on printing 8x10's or larger, so 3 megapixels and up wasn't necessary.  I was turned off by Sony's proprietary media.  When it came down to it, it was between the Canon S200 and the Fugi 2800.  The only pluses for the Canon was the sturdier body (metal) and the small size.  But the 2X optical zoom was worthless.<br />I like the 4AA's over other batteries, because in a pinch, I can find them anywhere.  I bought some rechargeable NiMH and am all set.  The 6X optical zoom is great.  After having it, I wouldn't consider another camera without it.<br />The only thing I can bash on the camera is the size and the plastic body.  It is a little bigger than some cameras, but a small price to pay for the zoom.  After a few weeks, I got over the plastic body, but I still worry about dropping it.<br />Get a USB card reader with this (~$30), and you don't need to use the camera to download pic's.","This is our first digital camera and we love it. The 6X zoom has allowed us to take some outstanding vivid pictures of birds at the feeder and closeup of flowers and people.  The colors are vibrant and true. We are happy with our decision to add 128 mb card and NiMH rechargable batteries ($20 for 8 batteries and charger at SAMS). The only disappointment was that the camera bag recommended by Tamarac does not fit the camera and we had to return it.","OK, in a nutshell- This camera takes great quality photos rich in color. The detail really does rival that of higher MP cameras.<br />Much of this can be attributed to two factors. First, the 6X Optical zoom allows the photographer to bring the shot to them without the distortion that is caused by a Digital zoom. Second,  the lens Aperture, the size of the lens opening, is by far the largest of any digital camera I have seen in this price range. This large aperture gives the camera a greater light gathering ability and contributes to vivid color reproduction.<br />The camera's case is made of plastic, which may seem flimsy to some, and will probably scratch if not handled carfully. If you plan on accompanying the 'crock hunter' on an outback photoshoot any time soon, I recommend finding a camera with a metal casing.<br />The on-screen menus are logical and easy to navigate. The menus can be seen via the LCD (display screen) or the EVF (viewfinder). This camera has many amatuer features and they all work great. The movie feature has decent quality video (for a digicam) and good sound.<br />Because the viewfinder is electronic and it's source is the zoom lens, this camera is effectively a digital SLR, which means that the image you see is exactly the image you get -a great plus.<br />This camera's main drawback is it's display performance in low light situations. Both the LCD and EVF are useless at night, and indoor shots may become difficult under low light conditions. This may make it difficult to take advanced shots, as it may be impossible lock the focus on your subject properly. The flash will ensure that the pictures come out great, though, and its not like your wasting film if your subject isn't centered properly. Just fire away! Still its a major shortfall.<br />Software works fine, but you may want to use something you're more familiar with.<br />Get a set of Nickel Metal Hydride rechargable batteries. The higher the mAh the better as this determines how long the batteries will last per charge. I have found a set of 1800mAh batteries and they work great.","The Answer is yes. This thing is great! Low light, bright light, moving ( a great feature, 4 shots in 2 sec, cool!) still, clooooooose, far, any thing you want! And you get to see your photos after too. The only complaint extends to all Digital cameras with LCDs, you need to shovel in AA's (I left mine on for a few hrs and it ate 4 new ones) put it on powersave and buy some rechargeables.","This camera takes great photographs...stunning clarity and vivid colors...it's very easy to operate.  In low light conditions, the LCD/ECD do not operate very well, however...it'll still take pictures...the great thing about digital photography, you can take pictures over and over again...delete the bad ones until you get it right!  It has plenty of features; the manual is easy to read and is actually a tiny course in photography basics.  I was taking pictures 2 minutes out of the box; the next day at a wedding...I took over 100 photos...they were simply stunning!  The couple who got married wished they hadn't hired a professional!  You will get red eye...but there's plenty of software out there to fix that in low light conditions...however, the camera's strength is definitely outdoor photography...I have captured awesome close-ups of wildlife and nature scenes...the digital zoom is wonderful.  Would definitely buy this again!  Make sure to shop around, buy a 64mb or 128mb SmartMedia card, and 2 sets of rechargeable NiHM batteries.  I got a great deal @ Circuit city......","Where can I start? This camera is an EXCELLENT product! I was apprehensive because 1) I'd had such trouble with complicated hard-to-use techno gear and software, and 2) this was going to be my first digital camera and I wanted to have FUN, not be driven nuts by trying to slog through complications. I had really enjoyed photography years ago on a good 35mm camera. I did a lot of comparisons, and this Fiji just seemed to come out on top for what I wanted to spend. Yet I just HAD to go to a store to try it out first-hand. Boy, was I impressed!! I picked up a display and the controls are so sensibily designed that I was using it-no problem-in just a minute or two. I even took a mini-video on it. (A great feature I haden't even counted on.) Another feature that sold me on this camera was the 6x optical zoom--a must-have feature for creative photography. The sales guy recommended I get a transfer device, and I'm glad I did. You put the memory card in it and download the pics into your computer.  (I got one called \"Dazzle\" and it's a snap.) I also bought a 128MB Smart Card for more memory. If, like me, this is your first digital (or you're upgrading) I COULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA MORE HIGHLY! I hope this review was helpful to you. Now I'm going back to having more fun with my new camera!","I work in a camera store ,so I'm always playing with the new items that come in. Fuji's line of digital cameras is great!!  They are so user -friendly that I can take one right out of the box and start using it without even having to read the instruction book! Everything is right there on the viewing screen! The 2800 also feels great in your hand! Has a good grip on it! But most important, the pictures from it are more true-to life color than from most other brands of digital cameras! Prices are affordable,too!!","When I got my camera i knew it was a 6X zoom, but after reading the booklet which explained everything i knew how to do everything. I'm not that into electronics but I use them in my daily life a lot. So, when my mom got me this camera so i could take it on my upcoming trip i was thrilled. The only downside the batteries finish quickly, but the pictures are efficient.","No long review here.  This is an exceptional camera.  Pictures are near perfect, feature set is better than most in its class, battery life is best I've had in any digital camera, weight is perfect, zoom is great, etc etc etc<br />Only 1 bad point:  The viewfinder has a hard time in the dark - still takes pics though...","This is my 2nd Digital Camera. My first was a polaroid. Awful! And I paid more for it then I did this one. I couldn't even print pics because they were not clear and could only be printed in snapshot size. The Fuji finepix 2800 is great.IT has awesome image quality. It has one of the best zooms in its price range, you can take movies 60secs long with sound. This is one of the few cameras even close to this price that you can take movies that long and it has sound. The lcd and viewfinder are both color . You can take pics that can be printed into 8x10's. You can add voice captioning to pics.Its easy to set up and use.<br />  As for the Eve /LCd screen , I haven't had any problem with lighting in my house and I didn't turn on the lights during the day or open blinds and I had no problem using the lcd screen. Now the movies still turn out good but I do reccommend some lighting when shooting those. Another great feature is it is also a webcam. The last digital camera I bought cost more then this one plus I had to pay for a webcam separate. Its like getting a webcam for free. The sound quality is great for the movie footage and voice captioning. I love this camera! I shopped around for a couple of months online and instore and kept coming back to this camera!<br />  I also really liked the added software . The adobe photo deluxe is a great ,easy to use, picture software , plus the 2800 also includes Video Impression for your home movies. You can add animated screens, sound effects, edit and organize your movies, and mail or store them all with Video Impression. This is the best camera package you can get for the money.<br />  Oh and I bought rechargeble batteries , [price] for a set of 4 AA. I also got a charger for [price]. Rechargeable batteries are a great asset to any digital camera owner .  The only other thing I would have liked to have seen for this camera is a camera case/bag. I do think that should have been included but other then that I couldn't ask for anymore!","i just bought the fuji finepix 2800, is the best camera you can find for 400$, the zoom is great, the closest competitor is the olympus C-700 the price of the olympus is higher, as well as the zoom is bigger, but the rest of the camera is pretty much the same : 2.1 mp, video&sound, size etc.... so if you are thinking in buying a digital camera, I highly recommend this one.","After using the camera, the labels on the buttons like \"Power\", \"Back\", \"Display\", \"Menu\" are all gone. I guess the sweat on my palms erased all of the labels. The words \"Finepix\", \"2800 Zoom\", have faded. It lacks an AV out, the 6x zoom is useful but lacks image stabilization.<br />I'll try the Canon A40 if given the chance.","After 3 months of ownership:<br />Very capable little camera with excellent 6x zoom.<br />Could use even more telephoto.<br />Wish it had manual shutter-priority.<br />2 megapixel is fine for regular snapshots, but you need 3+ MP when cropping/enlarging your photos.<br />Great, simple digital camera for typical user.","My first digital camera and I'm very happy with the purchase. Don't know what the previous reviewer's problem with XP was, but like another reviewer said... I just plugged it into the USB port and XP auto-configured the new \"removable\" drive with 0 problems. Highly recommend this camera. Pictures are fantastic and PC transfers are a snap...","I bought two digital cameras recently. Both of them Fuji. Mine is the 2600zoom finepix and the 2800zoom is the one I got for my wife. ( She thought it was 'cute'.) Personally, I like the 2600 better for a number of reasons. It comes with a battery recharger and two of the 1700mHa batteries by Fuji. The 2600 only takes two batteries instead of four like the 2800 does, and they last a long time.(The 2800 eats up the batteries, you will want to get extra batteries and a fast charger for it.) Overall both cameras are excellent and I give both 5 stars. The 2600 is just a better value when you weigh all features and benefits. You will have to order an a/c adapter for both cameras from Fuji as they are an option, and I had to buy a charger and rechargable batteries for the 2800 after the purchase. It comes with 4 alkaline batteries when you buy it. They lasted about 25 minutes before they were dead.(No lie) I don't particularly like the grainy look in the view finder of the 2800. I'm not fond of the way the viewer goes blank when you take the picture either. The 2600 doesn't have this grainy appearance at all and it doesn't blank out when you snap the pic. Of course the 2600 doesn't have the ability to show you the display and menu in the view finder like the 2800 does. The 2800 video mode is much better than the 2600 and the sound quality is quite impressive too.(No sound on the 2600) The one thing I found after the purchase is that most of the NiMH batteries you will find are 1600mHa and Fuji's are 1700mHa. This may seem slight but it makes a difference in how long the batteries last between charges and how fast they recover after each shot. I found some that were 1800mHa and Fuji told me not to use them as they may damage the camera. I recommend that you find 1700s because the 400mHa difference is quite noticable. The 5 volt a/c adapter for the 2800 and the 3 volt a/c adapter you can get for the 2600 both have plenty of length to the cord and I like that. Overall for the money the 2800 is a good deal but other than the 6x zoom feature it really doesn't take any better pics than my 2600 does. It was harder to find a case that would hold the 2800 than it was for my 2600 and the 2800 is heavy compared to the 2600. I'm glad the 2800 is my wife's camera really. The only time I'll use the 2800 is if I just have to zoom in twice as far for a shot. ... My wife thinks it was worth it and love the camera. I'd recommend either one but value for value the 2600 is a better deal. Fuji has got it going on with these little cameras. They are impressive. If they came with an a/c adapter and carry case and if the 2800 just had a charger and NiMH batteries it would be better but they'd be a lot more expensive up front I'm sure. The fact is though, these are both quite high in quality and supreme user friendly cameras.","This is my first digicam and I spent a great deal of time researching this camera along with others. I was looking for a camera...I finally settled on the Fuji 2800Z. To date, I am extremely please with my purchase, as I have found this camera to be an excellent value for the money.<br />Some of the positives of this camera include, a killer 6x Optical Zoom, Sharp and Crisp Pictures, extremely easy to use menu system, 60 second video with audio, and it can double as a webcam.  This camera is pretty much a point and shoot camera so if you are looking for a digital camera that has a wide selection of manual settings, look elsewhere as this camera is not for you. You do, however, have control over the white balance, exposure, and flash settings. Other than that, the rest is automatic.<br />As I mentioned, this is a great little camera, however it is not without a few \"flaws\". As well noted, this camera has trouble in low light situations, specifically the EVF and LCD. In the few weeks that I have had the camera and the several hundred pictures that I have taken, I have only run into 1 situation where the EVF and LCD were useless. This issue can be worked around and should not be a sticking point for those looking to purchase this camera. I personally like using the EVF as, unlike an optical viewfinder, it shows you \"exactly\" what is being photographed without distortion. Finally, if you decide to pick up this camera, make sure that you get some rechargeable batteries and a 128mb Smart Media card. You will be set.<br />In summary, if you are looking for a simple to use, point and shoot camera, with a great zoom, sharp pictures, and a few additional nice features, get this camera. You will be hard pressed to find a better camera for the money!","This Camera is GREAT! -- Very nice quality pictures, 6x optical zoom, very nice design -- I Love It.<br />I bought a MiMh reacharable battery by Telepower,... plus a charger ...- it lasts me for almost 200 shots. It is a little bit bulky, so i had to look for the right carrying case, which i found one by Targus... An extra 128mb memory card and i can take high quality pictures at low camera cost. Great value - Recommend to have one.","I finally decided that the time was right to buy a digital camera.  I knew I wanted a... range camera, and I researched all of the 2.0 megapixel... cameras.  The Fuji camera came out on top for several reasons -<br />1. It actually looks like a camera.  This may sound silly, but some of the other cameras in this price/feature category were so small that I was afraid that I would either lose it or break it.  The FinePix 2800 feels very solid and sturdy.<br />2. Fuji's reputation.  My wife has a 35 mm Fuji camera that she's had for years and it has never given her a problem.<br />3. Features.  This camera, compared to all other similar cameras, came with the most features.  It comes with the USB cable, all required software, 16 MB flash memory (double all the other cameras), and 6x optical zoom.<br />4. Compatibility.  It DOES work with XP - I hooked it up to my XP PC, and XP said, \"I've found a new digital camera.  It's a Fuji FinePix 2800.  I will now configure it for you.\"  That's all I needed to do.  I have more editing options that I know what to do with.  And that's just from hooking the camera up to my PC!  I didn't install a single piece of software.  My Windows 98SE PC needed the software installed, and installation was quick and easy.<br />- Setup was simple and straightforward.  The instructions are clearly written and easy to follow.  It takes wonderfully crisp and clear pictures.  And with MS Photo Editor (what I use on my 98SE PC), I have all of the basic photo editing features I need.<br />- I don't mind the fact that it eats batteries - it's to be expected with this class of electronic device.  I did order the A/C adapter from Fuji, and I think it's been previously said... be prepared to wait on hold for a long, long time.  The 1st time I called, I waited for 20 minutes and got disconnected.  I called back and waited 15 minutes.  Once I got through, they were very nice and courteous.<br />Final thoughts are that it's a great digital camera, even for someone who has never owned one (this is my 1st).  Compact, easy to set up, and takes crisp, clear pictures.  I feel it's the best bang-for-your-buck out there.  Definitely give this one a long hard look when making your decision!","This is a wonderful camera.  Easy to use, tons of features and it produces fabulous pictures.  I have had no problems.  That was until I upgraded from Windows 98SE to Windows XP.  Now I can no longer upload my pictures to my PC.  Although XP will detect the camera and load the correct USB drivers, it will not give you a drive designation.  When XP tries to communicate with the camera, it fails and tells to check your connections. ...I finally went to the Windows XP support site which lists digital cameras supported by XP.  This camera is not one of them.  Luckily my notebook has Windows 2000.  Btw, the manual that came with the camera states the software can be used with XP.  Which I fine but it does no good if the hardware does not work with XP!","The FinePix 2800 Zoom is Fujifilm's latest mid-range digital camera.

In low light you cannot see your subject the way you would be able to if you just had a \"see through\" or glass viewfinder.  But in daylight the electronic viewfinder actually will help you center and frame your topic more accurately.<br />The viewfinder and short battery life are the negatives.  But on the positive side this camera takes excellent pictures, quality and colors are beautiful.  I've taken most all my pictures at the \"medium\" default resolution setting and am totally satisfied with the quality.<br />The macro feature is very nice as well.  If you enable the macro feature and crank the resolution up to maximum you can take some incredibly clear, focused, and detailed close-up images.<br />Zoom lens works well and appears to be a positive for this camera because most models don't seem to have a zoom as high as this camera's 6x optical zoom.<br />Several trips to local camera stores indicated that this camera was a \"bang-for-buck\" model with superior optics and color reproduction for the $399 price tag.","Of all the items I purchased for Christmas, this was by far the best!  My girlfriend loves it and it is very easy to use.  The only complaint she has is the camera eats batteries like there's no tomorrow...one way to avoid that problem is to not use the LCD screen to take photos.  I recommend purchasing this camera because it is easy to use and \"very cute\" as my girlfriend says...and for the cost, you couldn't ask for much more.","I had been shopping the Nikon 775 when a ritz camera salesman pointed this out.  For the money and a 6x zoom lense I decided to give it a try, and I have been impressed.  I used to do some serious photography with medium format camera's, but sold them all years ago to pursue other interest.  I waited on the digital craze until the camera's became a little better and cheaper, but at my wife's insistance bought a digital camera so that we could have something to record family events.  I wanted one that would not be difficult for my wife and kids to use, as well as something that would take good photos.  This is the camera.  I have had no mechanical problems with it, and it works like a dream.  It is difficult to take photos inside if the light is low, however I've found it easier to just turn on an extra light.  I am a little bummed that the lens is not threaded to take filters, so you have to be carefule not to scratch the lens.  Given the current choices, I would buy this camera again.  If you  have any concerns about mechanical failure, buy it from a dealer that backs up their product.  This is the first time I have bought from Ritz, and was competely satisfied with their service.  Fuji if your listening, fix your low light problems, thread your lenses, and I'll probably buy your next version as well!","What a beautiful little digital camera. Does everything I could wish for. The EVF is not as bad as some would have you think and I soon got used to it. I found it excellent in almost any conditions that one would be wanting a digital camera for. In any  lower light photography, I would be more inclined to use a standard SLR on a tripod as a larger diaphram opening would be necessary. Digital cameras and Film cameras each have their place in photography and neither does exactly what the other is capable of, so don't expect your digital to do everything.<br />The 6 times zoom is the best I have seen and even the farthest away object in the photo is displayed in all it's detail.<br />The voice captioning is another neat feature that allows you save your images with their own talking display. Fantastic.<br />I have no complaints about this camera and can recommend it to anyone who is contemplating buying a digital camera. It is my second digital camera so I knew what I was looking for when I bought it.","What a beautiful little digital camera. Does everything I could wish for.

The color is a bit better using this camera then the A20.  This camera capture true brilliant color from an object.  Overall performance is a good camera.  The movie function is great too.  The zoom is amazing.  6x optical and 2.5x digital.  The design is very compact.  Every eye stop and ask question about what kind of camera it is....cause it's so sexy.  You can hold it real well.  The lens cover is like a lens cover for camcorder, in seperate entity.  It doesn't cover itself when you turn off the camera.  You have to put it manually.  It uses 4 AA batteries.  You may want to have NiMH rechargeable sets for this camera.  I have 4 sets my self.  The 16MB SmartMedia comes from the kit seems to capture enough pictures in it's low resolution.  Personally, I like using the lowest my self.  I don't like to print them, that's my I bought this camera.  Eventhough the camera has a normal quality for the VGA-mode (lowest resolution), it still delivers Excellent pictures.  You don't have to go high in resolution if you don't have too.<br />I do still have someting that I don't like about this camera:<br />1.  The LCD is too dark.  My A2 does a better job on this one.  Eventhough only 1.5\", A20 seems to g\\have more pixels on the LCD part of the camera.<br />2.  This camera is lack of manual settings. With Powershot A20, you can go using a few effects like black and white, and more white balance setting choices.  Although this camera doesn't come with those features, it still comes with white balance functions.  It's just limited.<br />That's about it.  95% of the time, I love this camera because of it's results, sexy look, and small size.  You gotta love this camera.  It's nice, not that expensive, and it takes excellent pitures.","I've only had my camera a few days but am very pleased with what I got for the price.  I was looking for decent picture quality and optical zoom. At 2.1 megapixels the picture quality has been great and the 6X optical zoom is the equivalent of a 38-228mm film camera zoom, more than flexible enough for most situations.  The menus are simple and intuitive.  Installation of the software went fine on my Windows XP machine at home, though the instructions are a bit fuzzy (probably a bad Japanese translation)  However, when I tried to install it on my laptop at work, I finally found something that would crash Windows 2000 Professional when trying to plug the camera in in PC camera mode.  Haven't got that one figured out yet.<br />If I have one criticism, it is an echo of an earlier reviewer, the EVF and the LCD are more or less useless when shooting in low light conditions.","This small clumsy looking camera is not what I just described.<br />Unless you have extremely large hands and fingers this is the DC for you. It not only comes with a 2.5X digital zoom, but a 6X optical zoom. The camera is very user friendly. The indoor digital photography is somewhat problematic. Images thru the viewfinder and LCD screen are dark unless in very well lit area. So you have to guess that your subjects are ready for their pic to be taken. Then again it's a digital camera, \"if ya don't like the picture after reviewing it, just erase the frame/s and reshoot another shot.<br />I would recommend this camera to anyone in the DC market, that don't have 800 to 1000 dollars to spend on a higher mega pixel camera. This one fits my budget and needed camera features.","I love the camera, except for one thing, the LCD and the view finder screens does not light up very well (people show up as dark images, and I had the room light up with 7x100 Watt lights), when you take pictures indoors. Outdoors it works fine. It like shooting in the dark when you inside, the pictures on the hand turn out great....","I must be the only reviewer who has actually bought one of these - let alone used one - because despite the claims of previous reviewers, the camera is not made out of metal, but silver painted plastic!<br />Despite this fact, the camera is VERY nice to use: it is comfortable in the hand, and produces sharp pictures with a crisp, clean color balance.","The Fuji 2800 is the smallest 2.1 meg. DC and has a 6X lens.  The ergonomics are perfect provided you use your third finder to push the button for photos and not your index finger (which naturally falls over the On/Off button).  My wife, the actual \"giftee\" is technically challenged.  I needed a DC with simple to use \"point and shoot\" technology and this one delivers in SPADES!  She is thrilled at the fact that it is NOT a rangefinder (she cuts off heads othewise) and that the screen is bright.  Downloading is easy and Fuji appears quite committed in that they have a special user-only web site that is oriented to their customer needs.  I am very pleased...","This is my first Fuji experience and it comes in the fast growing, high quality, 'ultrazoom' category. For most users, these cameras will be perfect, as they offer excellent resolution (a measurement of digital photo density that determines how much the photo can be enlarged before it becomes too grainy), good optics (quality of the lenses) and very powerful zoom lenses that allow for, well,.....zooming. All of them need larger memory cards & separate card readers to allow for easy download of the pictures into the computer (easily purchased and reasonably priced), but strictly speaking, they are ready to go out of the box. This Fuji is especially attractive with its gleaming, sturdy all steel body. It has all glass optics and a wonderful 6x optical zoom. It is also smaller than you might suppose and feels balanced in the hand. Controls are excellent and allow for lots of user input, or none at all if you prefer to put it on 'autopilot'. The main competitors would be the Minolta Dimage 5 and the Olympus 700. Take your pick, as they are all awesome when compared with anything available even a year ago!!","(...) I liked the fact that it looks like a camera and that it is quite small, compact and light weight. I did some research, but honestly not that much. I was interested in optical Zoom, and the 6x optical zoom is what made me buy the Fuji 2800Zoom. Most of the other digital cameras in my price range only had 3x Optical zoom. So far I've taken at least 50 pictures and I am very pleased. The software installed easily and worked the first time on both of my computers, Win98 and Win2000 Professional. The only problem I have is that the on/off button is right where the 'take a picture' button is on other cameras, which means that I have turned the camera off, instead of taking a picture on at least 4 or 5 times.<br />I also like the fact that it has both a small eye viewfinder like a regular camera plus the eye viewfinder is also in color. Plus it has the LCD screen. The eye viewfinder is very useful in bright sunlight where you might not be able to see the LCD screen. You can change the LCD brightness also.<br />Overall I am quite pleased with this camera. The Fuji 2800Zoom has 2 megapixels, which at first I thought might be a drawback since 5 megapixel cameras are now available, but now I see that the photos are very clear and sharp at the \"1M Normal\" setting, so that is not an issue. The camera allows you to change the settings for picture quality. There are 8 settings. Naturally the higher the setting the fewer pictures you can record on the card. The lesser the setting the more you can record. But at the Normal setting, on a 16Meg card you can still get about 50 pictures of very good quality. If you need more you can buy a higher meg card to store more photos. That's it, have fun.","I got my Fujifilm Finepix 2800 three days ago and here's my first take.<br />The camera has a good look, and feels sturdy with the all-metal case. Its width is about that of a credit card, so you can say it's small; however it’s pretty thick (comparable to its width) due to its 6x zoom lens, so it won't fit in your shirt pocket.<br />I have only taken indoor photos, and the image quality is excellent. The photos usually look very nice as is, without having to be fixed by a photo editor.<br />The 6x optical zoom was a big factor in my decision to buy this camera. It doesn't work well for me when taking indoor pictures. I would have to keep the camera absolutely steady under the full zoom or the picture comes out blurry. A friend of mine has an Olympus C-2100, which has a 10x zoom. It comes with image stablization, which is probably absent in Finepix 2800 (at least I didn't find any mentioning of it).<br /><br />The electronic view finder (EVF) gave mixed results. On the one hand, it is great to be able to see everything with EVF, including the menus. This removes the need to switch on the LCD just to change some menu settings, and as a result, you get longer battery life. On the other hand, the EVF was completely useless in a low light setting. The room wasn't that dark, but the EVF was totally blank when I pointed the camera to a dark area, so was the LCD. I had to point the camera to the general direction and let the flash do its job. Luckily the picture came out OK, but still I wished I had an optical view finder at the time.<br />The webcam is very easy to set up. You'd use the menu to set the so-called \"USB mode\" to \"webcam\", and then connect the camera to the PC through the USB cable, just as if you were uploading the pictures. Then you'll launch the PictureHello program and that's it. The captured image is pretty dark, though.<br />It is just as easy to take a video as to take photos. The movie is a little dark, tough, when taken indoors.<br />Fuji says in the manual that the operation of the camera is only guaranteed when it's used with Fuji SmartMedia cards. However I am using a 128MB Mr. Flash SM card I bought (...) and the camera took it without incident. I also bought 1600mAh NiMH batteries and a charger from newegg.com. The price was great, so was the service. I highly recommend them.<br />The battery life seems very good. I have taken over 100 indoor photos, all using the flash, and the 1600mAh batteries are still going strong. As I mentioned earlier, it certainly helped not to have to switch on the LCD very often, but I didn't go out of my way to avoid using it.<br />Software installion on my Windows 2000 laptop went smoothly. It was actually a series of independent installations for USB driver, FinepixViewer, QuickTime, VideoImpression, and Microsoft Media Player, etc. You can also install Adobe's PhotoDeluxe and ActiveShare.<br />All in all, I am having lots of fun with this camera. It has its limitations, such as the lack of TV out and certain manual controls. But I would say at this price level you won't find another comparable camera that has such a rich set of features."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix A101","amazon_reviews":["Very good, no problems...thanks.","good little camera; expected cheaper but pleasantly surprised","This was the first digital camera I got, and it is a great starter camera for someone switching over from analog film cameras to digital, especially considering the price.  It is simple, easy to use, and takes reasonably good pictures, again, considering the low price.  For basic needs it is pretty good.  Don't look for advanced features and the resolution quality of the pictures is only so-so, especially as technology improves the quality of digital cameras.  Still, for a novice or beginner, this is a great camera!","I bought this camera because I like Fuji. Their cameras have good color.<br />This is about their first digital so it's really a bargain today. The pictures are good. The lens gets covered up when the camera is turned off.<br />It takes two AA batteries so that's good. The Smartmedia are also cheap enough.<br /><br />The camera is quick because it has a fixed focus so you just turn it on and shoot. Its small enough to fit in a large pocket. I highly recommend<br />this camera as a first camera or a camera to just keep in the tool box or<br />purse or backpack and not have to worry about. It's also a good camera for a child since it was good quality in its day it's still good now at a bargain price. If you need more resolution opt for the A201.","I LOVE this camera! I have owned it for almost 2 years now and use it all the time. Last Christmas I thought I wanted to upgrade so I bought a 3 megapixel Kodak camera and ended up returning it because it wasn't as good as my 1.3 megapixel Fuji. This camera takes wonderful macro pictures which is essential if you sell online, the Kodak took lousy macro pictures. The Kodak also did this weird double flash thing so when I tried to take pictures of my cats I always got them with their eyes closed. I have no trouble at all with my Fuji. One flash and you've got the picture. I tell you, If I ever did decide to upgrade it would definitely be a Fuji.<br /><br />The pictures from this camera are fabulous! I use it for e-mail pictures, prints, and online auction pictures. It's great for all of those. When I got my camera I had in mind to mostly use it for auction pictures but it turned out to be even more useful than that. I take tons of pictures of friends, family, and my pets. Then I e-mail pictures to those friends and family. I also make prints (sometimes through an online / store service sometimes at home with the printer) for scrapbboking and they very good. I will admit that if you look really close they aren't as good as prints from a film camera, but I find the convenience of the digital worth it.<br /><br />All in all, if you only have about $100 to spend on a digital camera I HIGHLY recommend this one!!!","I've had this camera for a couple years now, and I'm still quite pleased with it.  At it's prime, it was one of the smallest cameras around.  However, that size does come with a price.  IE, lack of features.  There is no zoom(only 2x digital, and can only be used in VGA mode) fixed focus, and very few manual settings.  However, the camera still is quite good.<br />Pictures are pretty good.  If you have ample light, they are wonderful.  If it's dim, you get yellowish colors.  This can usally be somewhat corrected with software.<br />The one major problem i've had with mine is the selector swith is giving out.  Many times as I'm composing a shot, it'll flip back to preview mode.  People might also have problems finding cards now of days, as it uses Smart Media cards(NOT Smart Digital)<br />All in all, a great point and shoot camera.  Great if you don't have time to fiddle with focusing and such...","It takes GREAT pictures. But when the lens get dirty, the pictures show up with specks all over. And it normally has from 12-20 pictures you can store with the default memory card. It eats the batteries after about 10 pictures, with any batteries, I've tried almost all the brands. I recommend getting an A/C adapter.","Very good, no problems...thanks.","good little camera; expected cheaper but pleasantly surprised","This was the first digital camera I got, and it is a great starter camera for someone switching over from analog film cameras to digital, especially considering the price.  It is simple, easy to use, and takes reasonably good pictures, again, considering the low price.  For basic needs it is pretty good.  Don't look for advanced features and the resolution quality of the pictures is only so-so, especially as technology improves the quality of digital cameras.  Still, for a novice or beginner, this is a great camera!","I bought this camera because I like Fuji. Their cameras have good color.<br />This is about their first digital so it's really a bargain today. The pictures are good. The lens gets covered up when the camera is turned off.<br />It takes two AA batteries so that's good. The Smartmedia are also cheap enough.<br /><br />The camera is quick because it has a fixed focus so you just turn it on and shoot. Its small enough to fit in a large pocket. I highly recommend<br />this camera as a first camera or a camera to just keep in the tool box or<br />purse or backpack and not have to worry about. It's also a good camera for a child since it was good quality in its day it's still good now at a bargain price. If you need more resolution opt for the A201.","I LOVE this camera! I have owned it for almost 2 years now and use it all the time. Last Christmas I thought I wanted to upgrade so I bought a 3 megapixel Kodak camera and ended up returning it because it wasn't as good as my 1.3 megapixel Fuji. This camera takes wonderful macro pictures which is essential if you sell online, the Kodak took lousy macro pictures. The Kodak also did this weird double flash thing so when I tried to take pictures of my cats I always got them with their eyes closed. I have no trouble at all with my Fuji. One flash and you've got the picture. I tell you, If I ever did decide to upgrade it would definitely be a Fuji.<br /><br />The pictures from this camera are fabulous! I use it for e-mail pictures, prints, and online auction pictures. It's great for all of those. When I got my camera I had in mind to mostly use it for auction pictures but it turned out to be even more useful than that. I take tons of pictures of friends, family, and my pets. Then I e-mail pictures to those friends and family. I also make prints (sometimes through an online / store service sometimes at home with the printer) for scrapbboking and they very good. I will admit that if you look really close they aren't as good as prints from a film camera, but I find the convenience of the digital worth it.<br /><br />All in all, if you only have about $100 to spend on a digital camera I HIGHLY recommend this one!!!","I've had this camera for a couple years now, and I'm still quite pleased with it.  At it's prime, it was one of the smallest cameras around.  However, that size does come with a price.  IE, lack of features.  There is no zoom(only 2x digital, and can only be used in VGA mode) fixed focus, and very few manual settings.  However, the camera still is quite good.<br />Pictures are pretty good.  If you have ample light, they are wonderful.  If it's dim, you get yellowish colors.  This can usally be somewhat corrected with software.<br />The one major problem i've had with mine is the selector swith is giving out.  Many times as I'm composing a shot, it'll flip back to preview mode.  People might also have problems finding cards now of days, as it uses Smart Media cards(NOT Smart Digital)<br />All in all, a great point and shoot camera.  Great if you don't have time to fiddle with focusing and such...","It takes GREAT pictures. But when the lens get dirty, the pictures show up with specks all over. And it normally has from 12-20 pictures you can store with the default memory card. It eats the batteries after about 10 pictures, with any batteries, I've tried almost all the brands. I recommend getting an A/C adapter.","This is a great little camera.  It's very small and portable, it's easy to use, and it takes a pretty good picture.  What it lacks in fancy functions it makes up for in its fun, simple form.  I'm not a professional photographer so I don't care what the \"f-stop\" is doing, I just want to be able to take pictures of stuff and look at them on my PC.<br />The software is pretty good, and pretty easy to install or uninstall.  I used it on Windows Millennium with surprising success, but Windows 2000 seems to detect when the camera is connected to the USB cable more reliably.  As far as the functionality of the FinePix software, it's pretty basic, but once again, I don't think I'll be doing a lot of editing; most of the pictures turn out looking pretty good to me.<br />The memory that comes with the camera is pretty wimpy; you can get a 128MB card very reasonably and have tons of room for jpegs and mpegs.  Even though it's pretty easy on batteries, a stock of rechargeables is a good idea.","ONE OF THE BEST ENTRY DIGITAL CAMERA THAT MONEY CAN BUY! VERY EASY TO USE, GREAT PHOTOS AND ONLY USES 2 AA BATTERIES, VERY REASONABLE AND VERY SMALL FOR SHIRT POCKET AND LCD SCREEN VERY EASY TO SEE, EVEN IN DAYLIGHT! A JOY TO USE!!!","This is a very nice entry level digital camera.  It is excellent to use at day time with ample lights.  BUT, at night time you will see some white spots like snowflakes.  So if you are looking for something to use just to get average pictures this is a very good one, very compact and easy to use.","This camera is an outstanding choice for the average snapshot photographer. Easy to set up, easy to use, and high quality pix that rival the output of cameras twice the price. At 1.3 megapixels you cannot expect to be able to make 8x10  prints, but 4x6 and 5x7 are excellent, as are pix attached to email or posted to websites. Automatic mode works just fine in many situations, but manual overrides and options like forced flash and red eye reduction add to the versatility and usefulness of what is, at the end of the day, mainly a snapshot camera. Fuji's documentation is pretty good (not great) and fairly well presented. If stumped, stop and go back to the instructions. The answer is there. I've been well satisfied with the Fuji SLR I've owned and used for 20 years, and find myself using and enjoying my new A101 even more.","This was a good camera at the time I bought it, which was about two years ago.  Now I realize that I need to buy a new one.  The camera itself takes moderately good pictures but that's about the only positive side to it.  When you want to look at the pictures you've taken on the screen, it's a huge battery waster.  My biggest pet peeve is the time it takes to 'reload' after taking a picture.  It's an ok camera if you just want to try one out.. but it's no good if you're an avid photo taker.","It is obvious that not many of you reviewing this great little camera have used digital cameras before.<br />All digital cameras eat batteries. Period. I have a Pro Model digital camera that will suck the life out of a set of alkalines in 20 shots through the viewfinder.<br />I bought this camera to take with me everywhere and to snap spontaneous shots and it works fantastically for the money.<br />Get yourself some rechargable MAHA NI-MH batteries and you'll love it.","I was looking for a decent but cheap camera & since this one was cheap I bought it.  It gave bright, clear pictures and I had no trouble loading them onto the pc.  Later, I decided to return it & get an even cheaper camera that had the same 1.3 megapixels.  What a difference.  The other camera took blurry pictures & not nearly as brigtht & colorful.  I took it back & exchanged it for this model again & have been happy ever since.  Yes - the batteries do go bad quick but the previous reviews offer good advice that I have heeded: buy a charger/renew batteries; don't use the lcd whenever possible. I didn't get the a/c adaptor cord because I figured the battery charger with 2 sets of battereis was all I needed.  The idea was to stay cheap.  Plus if I sell this camera later, the charger will always be good for other items, while the ac adaptor would go with the camera.","I have enjoyed this camera even though it goes through batteries the way a film camera goes through film!!!(if not worse). I really like the webcam ability. It is a great camera for those everyday point and shoot scenarios. The resolution is perfect for web and online sharing of photos. Recommend that you buy the largest storage card you can afford. This makes those long trips easier since you don't have to clear off the memory.","I brought this camera about....two or three months ago. I love it. It was cheap ,and it takes amazing photos. The PC Cam mode is great! The only downfalls is how quickly is eats up batteries. But that cam be remedied by A.) not using the LCD Display for every picture...and B.) BUYING AN AC CORD!!","I bought this camera six months ago and I take it everywhere with me. The picture quality is good for near distances, though the limit of the resolution will show up when photographing a distant object. I also use the camera for taking short videos. Check out ... for short videos of Leapfest 2002 - a parachute comptetion.I found it helpful to buy several 64mb smartmedia cards, and for [$$$], pick up a usb card reader. It works with both my laptop and desktop computers, so you do not have to worry about using up your batteries or buying an ac adapter to transfer the images and video. Beware of cheap smart media though - I had a 64mb PNY card quit after just two uses. The Fuji card I bought has worked constantly for 6 months and a couple thousand pictures.","you need to buy an AC Adapter because when the cam is connected to pc there's loss of power during data transmission.","This camera seems to have it all for a sub-200 model!  Although I am not a novice digital photographer, I am not a professional -- nor do I want to be.  I wanted a camera that would take nice pictures of friends, family and the occasional scenery shot that could be printed out or uploaded.  The Fujifilm 1.3 does this well, and prints very nice photos at photo size (I do 4x6, 5x7).<br />The selling points (besides the price) are as follows:  1) its very small -- making it easy to take with you in a pocket, 2) it works on both my Mac OS X and Win 98/ME PC via USB -- essentially plug-n-play, 3) it takes great daylight pictures, 4) it doesn't eat batteries if you don't use the display mode -- ie: operating it like a normal camera using a viewfinder. I have not filled up the 8 MB card that came with the camera yet, although I haven't tried very hard (maybe a max of 20 photos on fine resolution in a sitting). Because I download to a laptop, I don't really need to spend additional money for a bigger card. I've also dropped it a few times, without affecting performance, so its a pretty sturdy little camera.<br />The only issue I have with the camera is that there is a learning curve for most of the features that may cause you to lose good photo opportunities at first.  You have to read the manual to know how the display works, and how to set the camera for different sorts of lighting schemes. I blurred a few photos because I didn't realize the macro switch had turned on while it was in my bag, and didn't discover this until later when I downloaded them. I haven't quite mastered the various flash settings and took a low-light, indoor shot from about 8 feet away that isn't great. If I were to put some time in learning the display functions, rather that setting it on \"auto\" and using the viewfinder all the time, I might become quicker at changing the settings for different lighting situations. As it is now, the camera is fine for my uses, and I can usually brighten the \"mistakes\" in Photoshop.","For less than $170 (July '02) this camera is a solid performer at a sensible price. Normal resolution is more than adequate for the web and e-mail. Fine resolution results in quality good enough for at least 4*6\" prints at your local Kits Cameras or similar.<br />The non-audio 20 seconds of video is a bonus IMO.<br />With WindowsXP (Home or Pro) on your PC you'll find this camera very easy to use, it is very straightforward to publish pictures to the web or automatically shrink and e-mail them instead.<br />Only 2 downsides that I've found;<br />1. The appears to be a tendency for dust to creep into the LCD disply area. Cosmetic only.<br />2. Battery life w/ LCD use is relatively low. So, don't use the LCD for every photo or get the latest rechargeable AA batteries.<br />I strongly recommend this camera for those seeking excellent value for money.","On it's own, this camera is strictly average.  Add the price into the equation, and this is a GREAT camera.  If you are strictly into standard photos, I really don't think you can beat this camera.  It even has a lot of extra features that I frankly don't need.  The AC Adapter is a MUST.  Like all digital cameras, it eats batteries with a ravenous appetite.","This camera has the best focus free lens and takes sharp pictures despite no focusing system. But to me this is a plus point since you are unlikely to produce off-focused results by accidentally pointing at the wrong subject.<br />It is a basic camera and has a nine zone metering system. but produces pretty dark pictures even in day light. This is due to the small aperture that comes with this camera. Fujifilm prob used the same AE exposure program from a camera with a bigger aperture!<br />Hence i suggest using it in Manual mode with a EV compensation of +0.6 to +0.9 for day conditions and +1.5 for in the shadow and night conditions. Anyhow this camera was not supposed to take night pics. Hence night pics are pretty much restricted to night Portraits. Landscape mode has to be achieved with Tripod.<br />Colour is vivid, but i see pics from Olympus C-1 (similar class) reproducing more faithful colours when indoor. Outdoor colours are fine for the fuji. With flourescent lamp indoor, you have to use the customised white balance mode. I normally choose the bulb icon.<br />The \"movie\" mode is for fun and don't take it too seriously. The software that comes with it can help you to make some fun videos akin to Charlie Chaplin movie. But you must use another software to remove the avi audio component to achieve better effects with your own sound / music library.<br />On the whole, Best Camera in 1.3Mega Pix Category. Fuji should dominate in this category.","This camera give an excellent image quality. For beginners in the digital photography is very good. However, the batteries don't last 48 shoots, it takes too long to save a picture, no zoom available, tricky flash options. Is good for non exigent pictures.","This is a great consumer grade camera. I have 2 SLRs, and 2 Nikon/Olympus One Shot cameras and for quick snaps, and sending pictures online - i'm hooked.<br />The 1.3MPix will fill a 1024x768 screen with sharp graphics. So far this camera's color accuracy amazes me. It is pocket sized, simple to use, and the price is tuff to beat. Most of my shooting is outdoors and it works well in a variety of lighting conditions - i usually shoot people with the flash.<br />The finepix PC software is basic. If you don't like it just plug in the Camera's USB port, and open the USB Device in Windows Explorer and use what ever you want. Buy rechargable batteries, you can maybe get 60 or so snaps with disposable's included.<br />In my opinion the next logical upgrade above this camera would be an optical zoom, and 2-3 MPix.","I recently also bought a Finepix A101. It was on sale...When I started taking pictures and going through the manual, I couldn't believe I am getting all these features for such a low price... sure it's a 1.3 megapixel, but that's good enough for me. The only complaint I have is when using the manual mode to take pictures without the flash, the picture usually comes out blurry. I found out u have to have a very steady hand to take pictures in that mode. Overall, great camera... compared it to my friends camera which cost 3 times as much and picture quality is about the same!","I have owned several 1 megapixel cameras before. And so far this one is the best.  It gets good battery life compared to other cameras.  The people that complained about battery life have obviously not tried the competition. This camera also takes good pictures, is easy to use, easy to download pictures to computer, and this camera is very small!  Not quite as small as the Canon Elph, but close! and for less than half the price.  The only negative about this camera,  is problems with indoor pictures.  Without fail, at least half of my indoor pictures have random white spots in them.  They range from pinhead to quarter sized and are randomly placed throughout the picture.  I called Fuji and they said it was normal and it was caused by the flash reflecting off of dust and airborne particles.  They told me it happens to a lot of digital cameras.  I have owned several digital cameras, and so far this is the only one that has done this.  Upon further research, I found an article linking this problem with the distance of the flash to the lens.  As you can see from the A101's picture, they are only a few millimeters apart on this camera.  The problem is so bad, that now I take 4 pictures of everything so I can make sure once will not have white spots in it.  I guess in the end, you always get what you pay for.","I bought this camera last night. The second I got it out of the box I poped the batteries in with the INCLUDED SmartMedia card and was taking pictures. The software was easy to install. That very night I put a picture from this up on my webpage. Great Camera Great Price! Oh one last thing a rechargeable battery kit it a must. Dont buy a camera with out one.","This is a very nice and affordable digital camera.  As for my experience with the battery life, If you don't use the display, the battery life is pretty good.  I do recomend rechargable batteries and a power adapter.  Use the power adapter ESPICALLY when you hook the camera up to a PC or use the video mode.  I still have not tried the web cam function, but if it's like the other features, functions of this camera, it will be very nice.<br />My ONLY complaint with this camera is the self-timer.  Once you set the self-timer and take a picture, you have to set the self-timer again if you want to take another picture using the self-timer function.  I have owned another digital camera (Polaroid) and while the pictures it took are NOT as good as this camera (FujiFilm).  The Polaroid camera had a self-timer setting that would stay on while you took as many self-timed pictures as you wanted to, then all you did was to turn off the self-timer function and go about your business.<br />OVERALL I do recomend this camera to EVERYONE!","This is a great camera for first time digigal buyers. It's light weight, takes great pictures and is so easy to use. One thing I really like is that the \"lag\" time after you take the picture is non-existent. It's the closest to using a regular 35mm that I've come across. If I could stress to all first time digital buyers, please expect to buy rechargable batteries and a larger smart media card and you will be set. Digitals ALL eat up the batteries. And the media card is an investment ... since you use it over and over again, unlike film. Buy this camera, you won't be dissappointed.","I've had mine for about a month now and have had a wonderful time with it.  The A101 is a small and sturdy unit with many more features than you pay for.  The automatic setting works well both normal and up-close photos but the extent of manual adjustments that can be made really impressed me the most, adding a lot of flexability to shooting a variety of shots.  Get the NiMH rechargable batteries right off- using the flash regularly will really drain your wallet quickly without um.  Great buy.  At the time of writing, Amazon's review said macs weren't supported but that's not accurate.  Much of the general data for the cam isn't really represented on the review page.  Research elsewhere for a complete and accurate list of features.  Enjoy!","The only downsides are that it eats batteries and the software that comes with it is of average quality.  It feels like it has good build quality, not a cheap peice of plastic.","This is our first digital camera. The camera is great, and the pictures are wonderful, but the speed it kills the batteries is insane! We went though the batteries that came with it in less than 20 minutes, and then it chomped down a new pair of Alkaline AA's in less than 5 minutes and we could not download our pictures from it fast enough.<br />We just purchased a set of NI-MH rechargeable AA's and hopefully that will help solve the problem.<br />This cameras software works great on our Macintosh and its very user friendly. The camera is very basic and simple to use.<br />Overall, I think it was a good value so I gave it 4 stars.<br />It would have 5 stars if it could use its batteries more efficiently.","I own an Olympus Digital Camera and needed to get a camera for my Mom that was very easy to use and download.  I figured out most of the basic features without looking at the owner's manual, so I figured she could master it with the owner's manual.  I especially like the 20 second video recording feature.  I was just very pleased with the whole package (camera, film, cables, manuals, cds, etc...).  Nicely packaged.","I own an Olympus Digital Camera and needed to get a camera for my Mom that was very easy to use and download.

Además, el tamaño de la camara es conveniente para llevarla a cualquier parte, y con respecto al gasto en baterias, no es tan grande como pensaba, de acuerdo a otros comentarios de usuarios. Si se tienen baterías recargables éstas durarán un buen tiempo.<br />En general, para el precio de esta cámara no se puede pedir más.","I bought this camera for my girlfriend - she's never used a digital camera before and she had no probs with it at all. I've used many different models and the A101 is one of the most intuitive to use, and the photos look good. Perhaps not the best camera available, but it's damn good value for the money.<br />We haven't tried the Fuji software (we've got photoshop, iMovie, etc. so we're not interested in the Fuji stuff) but with the USB connection it just plugs into our Mac and mounts on the desktop as a disc - easy as pie - just copy the images to the computer and that's it. Words of warning - don't try to trash the files on the camera through your computer - crash!<br />On the downside, it eats batteries like mad (it only uses two, not the typical four) and the optional digital camera accesory kit is not worth the money and in my case the rechargable batteries and charger were faulty.","Never thought I would write a review about anything, but I must really recomend this great product. In fareness the fifth star I put there for the price. Not very often I'm very satisfied with a buy but with this one I'am.  It gives nice 5x7 prints with good colour and sharpness, it's very easy to handle and it's small.<br />Seems like it is pretty well put together too, it fell out of my hands a week after I got it, into a cement floor and it still works just as good.<br />I think I'll buy one more !! There is one problem and that is, don't even think of using alkalines, buy rechargeable batteries. And thats it.","Never thought I would write a review about anything, but I must really recomend this great product. In fareness the fifth star I put there for the price.

And, for under $200, it is probably the best camera out there. Webcam feature is fun & easy to use, movie mode is nice, and it takes crystal clear pictures, with different flash modes, self-timer to allow you to get in the shot, and easy USB connection to PC/Mac. The only thing I would suggest is to get some rechargeable batteries and/or an AC adapter when you're at your comp, because it eats up AA's pretty quickly. The 1.6\" LCD screen is very nice, because it lets you see your pics immediately, to see if you want to keep them. Also, compact enough to fit in your pocket! GREAT CAMERA!!","This is a basic camera that is easy to learn on.  The features are easy to access and it takes great pictures.  A great \"starter\" camera.  I wish it came with an AC adaptor.","I've taken about 140 pictures, but only saved about 70 of 'em.  Its fun and easy to use.  The pictures it takes looks very clean and the color is magnificent.  (...) The auto mode works great for most conditions and the 4 other settings are very easy to use and navigate.  This camera will only hold about 12 pictures in 'Fine' mode on the 8mb card that it comes with--so get a 64mb card.. it'll hold 101 images which is more than enough for most people.  Also purchase some good rechargeable batteries.  I got a rapid charger + 4 batteries for around 40 bucks and it works great with the digital camera.  The alkalines that the camera came with only lasted about 25 shots before the camera shut down.  I used a battery tester to see how strong the batteries were and they were near full strength.  I tried using Costco brand Kirkland Signature AA Alkalines, but the green led in the back would merely light up then and quickly fade away.  Too weak to power the camera.  Great Camera with pretty good resolution.  I only wish there was an Optical zoom, but what do you expect from a sub $(...) camera?","Tengo que decir, si bien esperaba bastante de la camara, esta realmente me sorprendio. La calidad de las fotos es increible (en normal, imaginense en fine), conectarse al computador es muy facil y rapido. El sensor de luz es muy bueno, asi las fotos (hasta ahora) no me salen ni oscuras ni sobreexpuestas y lo mas importante muy nitidas.<br />Las baterias son un problema (asi son todas las camaras digitales) pero se soluciona facilmente con baterias recargables.<br />En resumen yo creo que vale mas de lo uno paga por ella","Overall i give this camera a pretty good rating, it takes great picture, it works nice as a webcam, and it shoots video.<br />but one thing i dislike is, it does not come with the ac power adapter and so far i have not been able to find one anyplace.<br />way to go fujifilm","I bought the Kodak DC 3200 and sold it because it over exposed pictures that where too close. The Fuji FinePix A101 is by far one of the finest camera's. It is very small and fits in your pocket compared to other cheaper brands that are bulky and large.<br />The LCD screen looks choppy in dim light but trust me the pictures although look choppy in the display they are excellently clear and sharp when you display them on your PC. The over exposure problem I had with the Kodak from the flash with pictures taken at close range is now a thing of the past. The A101 takes pictures up close and although they may seem over exposed in the LCD they are premium quality when you view them on your PC.<br />I would recommend this camera to anyone. I've even suggested it to family members telling them that I would buy it from them if they did not like it. I'm that sure that you will like it. This is most certainly not a camera for a professional or expert user. I would rate this camera a beginner to novice user level.","...it drains batteries.  I've taken about 10 pics and on my 3rd set of batteries.  Apparently, when I used it as a PC cam for about 10 minutes, the batteries ran out.  I suggest ordering rechargeable batteries and an AC power cord.<br />I still haven't figured out how to download the pics from the camera to the computer.  I'll try when the cord comes in.  Batteries are getting expensive.","I love this camera. It worth every penny!<br />If you're like me, you don't want to spend more than $500( or even $300) to buy a close to perfect camera. But the quality should be good. Then this is it! Why? (1) You don't see a lot camera below $200 come with flashlight, do you? (2) It's 1.3M Pixels CCD. That means you can print 5x10 pictures. (3) PC Camera feature. (4) Compact size, easy to use.<br />Of courese, it has some room to improve: (1) It's a battery-eating monster! Buy a lot of batteries or buy rechargebale batteries. (2) No optical zoom.(what do you expect for less $200?) (3) 8M smartcard is not enough. I've upgraded it to 64M from amazon.com for $29.(4) If it has built-in microphone would be convenient while using pc camera feature.<br />I suggest you can do some research and compare it with other cameras in this price range. It would surprise you.<br />(ps. if you want a little better quality, it has a sister product A201 which is about $60 more but 2.1M Pixels.)","Very well designed, full feature, really small digital camera at a very low price.  1.3 megapixels great for computer display and good for regular sized printed photos. Has many many high end features.  Uses cheap AA batteries (not long lived, however). Available ac converter.  Requires USB (with windows 98, 2000 or ME) computer to download to PC. Exceptionally easy to use. Has close-up macro facility (can take photos of regular text on a page).  Bottom line - a really well-designed digital camera"]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix A201","amazon_reviews":["If you are looking for a simple camera this is a good one.

These are no longer made, but there might still be some new ones & plenty of used ones floating around out there.<br /><br />I've updated this review in Dec. 2009 & the camera still works well.<br /><br />BEWARE: Uses obsolete SmartMedia memory cards, which are difficult to find (unless you order online). Yet for all these cards' obsolesence,their prices haven't come down.<br /><br />If you buy one, used or new, make sure its memory card contains at least 16 MB of memory.

No other camera comes close to its picture quality at this price. It takes fantastic outdoor pictures! Taking good indoor pictures can be challenging but is possible. Here are some hints I've found helpful:<br />- Keep your subject within flash range, about 8 ft or so.<br />- Avoid dusty environments. The glowing orbs you see is caused by the flash hitting dust particles.<br />- Switch the camera to Manual mode and experiment with the White Balance before you need to take that important shot. That way you can familiarize yourself with the different light settings and how they affect your picture.<br />- Buy a bigger Smartmedia card (mine is 128 MB) and take lots of experimental shots. You don't need to pay for film development so just keep shooting and erasing.<br />- Check and compare your pictures on a high quality computer monitor rather than the camera's LCD so you can actually see any subtle differences in color, lighting, etc.<br />- Buy rechargeable NiMH batteries and a charger. Buy the highest capacity batteries you can afford (at least 1600 mah).<br />- Remember, these are digital pictures. You can always use some sort of graphic imaging software to touch-up your photos if they are too dark or you don't like the color.<br />And remember, the primary function of this camera is to take digital pictures.

It's easy to use<br />and the pictures are decent. Just remember it's dated and it uses Smartmedia cards.<br />There is no zoom.","Nice, basic camera for a newbie or kid to get started with. These are no longer made, but there might still be some new ones & plenty of used ones floating around out there.<br /><br />I've updated this review in Dec. 2009 & the camera still works well.<br /><br />BEWARE: Uses obsolete SmartMedia memory cards, which are difficult to find (unless you order online). Yet for all these cards' obsolesence,their prices haven't come down.<br /><br />If you buy one, used or new, make sure its memory card contains at least 16 MB of memory. That should allow one to get about 50 pictures out of it when it's @ default settings.<br /><br />Disadvantages: no zoom function; steep learning curve if one has never used a digital camera before; must use rechargable batteries unless you want to spend a fortune on regular AA batteries; time it takes to green-light between shots is long -- not good if you're taking action shots.","The A201 is  very Good camera and I bought it with my own money( I am eight years old).

While I was not really in the market for a digicam, I just went for it being I do not own a camera and I needed one for an upcoming event.<br />I am happy I did.  The camera works very well.  Pictures look great, both indoors and out.  The interface is simple to use and taking pictures is a breeze, even for beginners.<br />Lucky for me I have several SmartMedia cards laying around from my old MP3 player.  With an 128M card I can take 997 pictures at lowest resolution/lowest quality or 166 pictures at highest resolution/highest quality.  I figure 166 pictures is like five rolls of film so I just jack up the settings to high and get great pics, perfect for printing, then resize them if I want to post them on the web or send them in email.<br />The only compliant I have is night shots.  I live outside of Manhattan and wanted to take some shots of the skyline.  Unfortunately even with in nighttime mode, the shots of the skyline we blurry.  You need a very steady hand or a tripod to work with the slow shutter speed of nighttime mode.  Also this camera lacks optical zoom, still you would be hard pressed to find a digital camera for under $200 that offers it.  The camera does offer digital zoom, but to be honest, digital zoom is a gimmick.<br />Bottom line, if you are looking for a inexpensive digital camera, this is it.  If you want a professional level camera, you are going to have to spend more but you will get more features like optical zoom.","The price is great, the camera small, but if you want indoor pictures, you'll have to expect that half of them will be blurry.<br />I'm pretty disappointed with the flash --and I've tried all of the settings.  I wrote to Fuji and they said 'use a tripod.'<br />Outdoor pictures, downloads, processor speed--all great.  But I'll get a bigger diameter lens on my next camera.","i have had this camera for about a week now. so far, ive been completely satisfied with it. however, when i first got it and hooked it up to my PC, the darn software wasnt able to read my pics. i could see them on the lcd screen, but for some reason the software wasnt reading it.. specifically it said the file was 'broken or an invalid format.' that kind of perplexed me. but i just took out the media card and put it right back in and WHAM.. software was all gravy from there. also, this camera does not come with rechargeable batteries, which is a real bummer! i solved that by picking up 48 AA generic kirkland signature brand batters from my neighborhood costco! the price is also a bit steep compared to other web merchants. i searched around a lot on the web for this camera and found it for a bit cheaper.. but with shipping and if you had bought a 32mb memory card as opposed to amazon throwing in free shipping AND a free 32 MB card, amazon turned out to only be a few dollars more, and who wouldnt pay a few bucks extra for great service from the trusty jeff bezos! =) the positives with this camera.. lightweight, quick to reload after taking pic, 20 second movie (mpeg) capability, easy to use, lots of options to mess around with, small size, simple layout, plenty of settings to fool around with, all around a good versatile camera. my favorite is being able to pan and zoom on the pic while viewing it in the LCD screen. this feature blew my friends mind! its nearly perfect, and its definitely a great value for fine fuji quality! for the price, this camera is a winner!","I got this camera as an extra with my Dell lap top about six months back.  I have been very happy with the quality of shots and have found the digital zoom useful.<br />I would definitely recommend getting rechargeable batteries for this camera.  You may also want to consider a separate smart media card reader for downloading your pictures to your PC.  I have had several instances where my batteries ran out while I was downloading the camera.","I bought this camera one day before vacation on a whim.  I had wanted a digital camera but had not done any investigation.  I was able to use the camera after reading the quick start instructions and got some great shots I could email to friends when I returned.  It was lightweight and fit into my pocket as well as my budget.I am sure I will learn more as I go along.  I would recommend you get a larger Smart Card right away especially if you are going on vacation.  I really like the fact that you can use regular AA batteries you can pick up anywhere. I sometimes had trouble reading the screen but think it was just the glare of outside. The 20 second video part was an added plus I had not planned on getting.","I have been using this camera for about a month now.  I am very impressed with all the pictures.  The close up zoom works great on flowers but takes a steady hand.  I recommend buying rechargeable nickle cadmium batteries because normal batteries drain too fast.<br />Highs: Ease of use. Close up zoom. 20sec movie capability. No lag in taking picture once button is pressed. Software is average.  Set up was a breeze on my win98SE PC<br />Lows: LCD screen hard to see when too dark or really bright. (But, because it's digital, you can take tons of pictures and just keep the good ones) Eats up normal batteries.<br />Bottom Line:  A great buy for entry level digital camera users.","I absolutely love this cam! Its small, sleek, extremely light weight & the photos turn out fabulous! Just point & shoot! Its very easy to operate. It can also be used as a web cam &  can make 20 second videos!  The only reason that I didnt give it 5 stars is because it doesn't come with an AC adapter & there's no fun photo software thats included...for instance photo greeting cards or calendars. :o(  Also, please note that digital zoom only refers to zooming in closer on the LCD screen to view the shots you've already taken","I got this camera for use on vacation. It took such amazing pictures of the German countryside that we now use it as our main household camera.  Connecting to your computer is incredibly simple, especially if you have Windows XP.  You will probably want to purchase a larger memory card to go along with the 16 MB card that comes with it.  It is very easy to use.  My twelve year old niece began to take pictures without any training, and they turned out great.  The movie function is great and I love the freedom of picture quality, flash, battery usage, etc. Overall this is a great camera for whoever wants to take great pictures.","I loved the camera, and the pictures are great.  Its small, compact, and very attractive!  Uploading the pictures is so easy, its a joy to do.  Make sure you get good recharable batteries.  It loves batteries, and its simply a pain in the neck.  GET GOOOOD BATTERIES! Well, I love the pictures and I know that with this camera its easy to post pics on eBay, keeping in touch with faraway friends and family, and of coarse, memories.  Buy it!","I was looking for a digital camera and wanted to use one that allowed me to get to the taking of pictures.  Later I will move on to a more complicated one.  Anyway I disagree with all of you who did not like the software.  I use software all the time and this is the first photo software that did what I want.  I agree with all the good things said before in other reviews.  If anything is wrong it is the drain on regular batteries so I bought the rechargeable ones.  The fact I could use the camera as a pc cam was an unexpected plus.  I think the main use of the camera is for doing e-mail, short videos and taking photos of people or things you want to display on the net.  I would never expect to shoot a long shot to a stage as one person did.  When you consider the size and all the features Fuji has packed into it, what a buy! Most of all I like that it slips into my pocket.","WOW, I bought this camera on holiday in New York, in Febuary, I was slightly worried about it not working in the Uk but when I found out it was USB connection I knew it would work at home, I was very excited to buy it!<br />I got 75photo's on the 16mb card and that is high resolution!<br />The only slight dissapointment is the video mode, how it cannot last longer that 20secs, HOWEVER u can video more than 1 clip, so you could have 5 video's all of 10secs long, depending on the memory you have. The AA batteries ..., get the rechearchable ones. the software is ok, very easy to install.<br />BEST CAMERA I HAVE EVER USED ZOON IS EXCELENT, PANNING IS AMAZING<br />BUY IT  YOU WON'T MISS OUT !","I bought this camera new ...through a camera store in New York ...<br />It really is quick to recover between shots. And the pictures are beautiful.<br />However, the software is AWFUL, bad to install, doesn't give you any choices on anything, but works, more or less, if you can get it installed.  The controls on this lightweight little camera are not overly intuitive, either.  And if you're using regular batteries and want preview mode on, carry a lot of spares. I've heard the rechargeables are much better, but I haven't tried them yet.<br />The flash is about what I would expect from a camera in this price range.  It's good for pictures within about a 10 foot range.<br />All the negatives asides, the picture clarity and color is outstanding and I would buy the same camera again in a heartbeat.  The zoom features (once you figure them out) are really remarkable for a camera in this price range.  I would recommend this camera at this price to a family member or any amateur photographer who wants to take quality pictures.","I recieved this camera as an x-mas present and i love it. the picture quality and so are the movies.I had a little trouble instlling the drivres but called tech support and they fixed the problem.The camera can also doubbles as a web cam.to get a clear picture when you are using it as a web cam you need lots of light.I purchased a set of Leap rechargable battries and they last forever even with the LCD on.I wish this camera had a burst mode.overall I am very pleased with the camera<br /> The softwear sucks.","You will hardly all those advantages in a cam :<br />-2.0 Megapixel(u can print on an A5 format)<br />-pocket size<br />-web cam<br />-white balancing and aperture compensation.<br />-movie mode(20s)<br />-the price!!!<br />So if you would like a cam that does it all, go for it!","This is a very fine camera. I wish it were a little cheaper, but it has lived up to the price in the image quality and softwear usability. It was the first USB camera that would work on my computer (a slighty older USB socket model). The photos are clear and sharp. You can zoom and, what is not mentioned, pan around the image on the camera via the very clear LCD monitor. It will take all the SmartCard media sizes (which was a problem with a previous digital camera I had. It only took one size). So image capacity is great. The compact size (and it is a small one) makes it real easy to tote and use (watch those fingers). Even for someone starting out in digital photography, you can't go wrong with this one. I do wish the \"movie\" feature could increase in time with the larger storage mediums, however. Thanks FujiFilm.","This little camera is a masterpiece of modern technology, combining efficiency with simplicity.  Although not \"top of the line\", it's a breeze to set up and use, with enough features to satisfy all but advanced digital photographers.<br />Key advantages over other cameras include: (1) Astonishing colour, (2) Super fast recovery (when using NiMH batteries), (3) WebCam capabilities, (4) Drag'n'Drop functionality, using the camera itself as a drive.<br />The only real disadvantage would be the lack of optical zoom, but I guess that you get what you pay for...","This is my first digital camera, and I was not disappointed.  The software was easy to set-up, and I'm also impressed by the quality of the photos.  I expected the A201 to be average, but it has certainly exceeded my expectations.  Great bang for your buck -- good first camera!","I haven't put the camera down since I got it!  It is very easy to use and takes great photos.  One of the best things is that it only takes 2 AA batteries.  The movie feature is also fun and the software lets you make small movies that you can add music to.  All this without hardly reading the instruction manual!  The camera is also very small and sturdy and you can buy bigger cards so it can hold more photos & movies - but it easily downloads so you probably won't need one.","This camera is the best and has a good price. To me I do not like to make movies, I just take pictures. If you want to make movies, buy a movie camera that is just for movies. Those come out better than cameras. I feel that the camera is preety good. Cheap and cool. That is all I need to say.","I just recently bought this camera in Japan and it was newly arrived. I was so amaze and easily to use, so small and pixel was outstanding and perform very well. All you have to do just plug the small usb wire thru and then go..I give this product AAA+  very very and good price too.."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix 2600 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["It is doing the job, but it didn't come with the memory card, and I am glad that my old camera had one so that I could start taking pictures.","Extremely minor scratches.

It's developed some problems over 10 years, but just last week for Easter, I took a photo of my daughters after their Easter Egg hunt, and the resulting photo was so eye-poppingly gorgeous and crisp that we printed it at 8x10, which is about the limit of its 2MP CCD. My wife and I have framed it and are sending 5x7's to our parents. It's THAT GOOD.<br /><br />Several members of my family have acquired digital cameras since then, all advertising higher megapixels or whatever, but their image quality was consistently poor from the start, often looking washed out even after processing on a computer (the GIMP is a great tool). Their menus also tended to be confusing and hard to use; the 2600's was direct and simple, and the manual mode was truly manual -- the only thing you lost was the self-timer. (Crap.)<br /><br />From what I see, it's now available for $25-40. I don't know if it's worth buying for the kid who has an iPod or a camera phone; I haven't been able to compare them, and some of these cameras might be a little dodgy after ten years. But if you can get your hands on it and try it, you just might like it, and might find it a worthy, inexpensive gift for a tween who's interested in amateur photography.","This was the first digital camera I ever owned.

I would do a little post-production on images that looked washed-out, but I'm not sure you can blame the camera for that, since I have only recently endeavored to understand how to get the correct exposure for my images. Point and shoot was all I ever did with this bad boy.<br /><br />In my experience, it sucks batteries dry in no time, but don't ALL digicams? The screen is a little small, but not unbearable. The major complaint is probably the size. Although it is compact from a facing view, the profile shows a very THICK little piece of technology. It is a fatty.<br /><br />Honestly, if I didn't mind how THICK the camera is, I'd probably pick it up again for twenty bucks. I might pick it up anyway for nostalgia. ;-)<br /><br />Final verdict: The resolution is low (by today's standards), the machine itself is large (by today's standards), but it takes GREAT pictures.","I've got three digital cameras.

Point and shoot was all I ever did with this bad boy.<br /><br />In my experience, it sucks batteries dry in no time, but don't ALL digicams? The screen is a little small, but not unbearable. The major complaint is probably the size. Although it is compact from a facing view, the profile shows a very THICK little piece of technology. It is a fatty.<br /><br />Honestly, if I didn't mind how THICK the camera is, I'd probably pick it up again for twenty bucks. I might pick it up anyway for nostalgia. ;-)<br /><br />Final verdict: The resolution is low (by today's standards), the machine itself is large (by today's standards), but it takes GREAT pictures.","I've got three digital cameras.  This one was my first.  A couple years later I bought a 5MP Canon.  A couple years after that I won a 12MP Nikon.  This camera is easier to operate and get good pictures than either of those newer models!","I have enjoyed this camera for about three years now. The picture quality is good and it is easy to use. BUT, just a few days ago while taking Christmas pictures it just died! The lens is stuck in an open position and the power will not come on. I have since learned that this camera is famous for working a year or so, and then the motor quits working. I would recommend a more reliable digital camera.","This fat little camera always had something \"special\" about it. Not only because it was the very first digital camera I ever owned and bought, but because of the great quality pictures it always rendered. I didn't know that, however, until I stupidly gave the camera away to a friend. I automatically believed any future camera I were to buy would give the same outstanding results, and indeed, most of the many cameras that were to follow that one did give me outstanding results. However, like I said, there was something \"unique\" in the pics this one captured. It always produced the brightest and richest colors and details. Nothing ever seemed to be \"off\" in the pics. Its macro capability always impressed me as well. I feel its macro capability was always underrated. Of course, this camera 'is' limited in that it is only a meager 2 megapixels and has no real manual capabilities to speak of, but you don't really need them if you are satisfied to take pictures in good lighting. Personally, I have taken really good pics indoors in dim situations using the flash and have been satisfied. Each photographic situation may vary of course. Outdoors though, on any bright sunny day is when this camera really shines with the pics it renders. I know that this camera is almost impossible to find now, but if you happen upon one (used or otherwise) and you can trust the seller you definitely should buy it.<br />By the way, my friend would not give back the camera even when I offered to pay him a good amount. I guess he also saw the \"specialness\" in the pics it captured. However, I 'was' able to find another one (refurbished at overstock.com) that is to this day every bit as good as the original one I bought. It gives the same awesome quality pics.","I bought this camera a few years ago, I was looking for a camera that was easy to handle, small in size, and was for beginners...well, I found this camera, and I got what I was looking for--a great, compact camera with excellent handling for beginners.<br /><br />This camera uses a SmartMedia card, which is really convenient since you can find SmartMedia cards just about everywhere for a bargain price.<br /><br />What was the deciding factor for me to buy this camera, was the amount of batteries it used.  I was surprised to learn that it only uses two AA batteries, it has so many features for a beginner that you would think it would use more batteries.  The life of the battery is fairly long, about 100 minutes, which is always nice.  Some people may complain that it uses AA batteries, and that they would prefer to use a lithium battery, but I always find myself asking--why?  It is so much more convenient to use AA batteries because you can pick them up anywhere.<br /><br />The only thing about this camera that I can complain about is that there is no way to attach any additional lenses or filters, you can't even attach an adapter to add on any thing to the lens.  For a beginner photographer, though, that is probably okay since beginners are not really using the lens or filters yet.<br /><br />Also, this camera is a little bulkier than I had originally thought.  It is small in length and height, but it is surprisingly thick.<br /><br />Other than that, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this camera during the time I had it, and the only reason I sold it was because I was ready for an upgrade.  But I loved this camera to bits while I had it--it really prepared me for the more advanced cameras, and it taught me all of my basic photography skills.  Excellent, excellent camera for beginners.","This is the second version of this camera that I have owned and it is easy, inexpensive and takes great pictures to boot. I travel all over the world with this thing and everybody wants to buy it from me!","I have had this camera for almost a year now, and I have DEFINATLY put it thru it's paces.  I really don't know what you guys have done to your battery compartments/lens assembly because I have beat this camera up pretty well and it's held up wonderfully.  The picture quality is on par with other 2mp cameras in this price range.  Low light performance is pretty bad but aren't all digital cameras!  The webcam function is pretty useless seeing as my VERY cheap webcam does a better job.  The movie mode is limited to 20 seconds a clip no matter what the size of your SM card.  It is rather thick and not the lightest chunk of plastic.  But, like I said in the beginning, between the price/contstruction/quality of this camera I'd give it two thumbs up!","I recently purchased this as a refurbished model and I couldn't be happier with it. The quality of the photos are fantastic. Previously I'd scan in photos using a 300dpi scanner. You can certainly see the difference here. Very sharp and vivid pictures.<br />I was impressed with the amount of options, especially with the flash. Video and webcam are nice extras too.<br />I like the gadgety sounds too, even though it doesn't add to the functionality of the camera.<br />Overall a happy user.","I have this camera for about a month and it is great. This my 3rd. digital camera in the last 2 years and is hands down the best. Picture quality on 2MB Normal mode is better than 3MB cameras I have owned. The included NiMh batteries are a a big plus (may be a good idea to get an extra set). I got over a 100 photos with one charged set. The software is adequate however there are better programs out there. The sliding lens cap can be annoying if not opened in the full position. The 16Mb card is ok for out of the box but a 64 or 128MB card will be required. The manual is detailed and concise but you won't need it, the controls are user friendly and you will have this camera up and running in minutes. The photos are incredible on auto mode, there are some manual modes included but if you are a serious photographer this is not for you. If you are like me who wants a digital point and shoot that replaces a point and shoot 35mm this is for you. I have looked around and did my research, for the buck this is a super value,  battery charger,  rechargable batteries, 16MB card, and pictures equal to 3.2 camera, you will not be dissapointed. Only negative I could find is the included software and the fact that you can't use regular alkaline AA or digital AA batteries as they are depleted after a few shots. I am sure that is why they included NiMh batteries. There is also no Video Out jack to view photos on TV. more pluses, the LCD is clear and larger than most digital cameras, the optical zoom is a real zoom that you can see through the viewfinder like an SLR, and printed 4X6 photos will suit most users, glossy paper and a decent printer will suit most needs for photos that are suitable for framing, if you need 8x10 or larger than a 3.2 is better suited for you, 4X6 is more than adaquate for me. Buy this camera you will not be sorry","i'm the type person that with(any new product) i hate to read instructions.hehe,i'm a man of course.well here goes,the display window and navigation buttons go hand in hand(self explanitory)i havent used all features yet,but just have started using my cam.it takes super great pictures.my only negative is that if you prefer using the viewfinder you will notice that(in my opinion) it is a little to small for my taste.so use the display screen insted.overall for the money i'm well satisfied.","I have pretty mixed feelings about this camera.  It's original raison d'etre it has fulfilled well - in transitioning my wife from 35mm to digital.  it's small, reasonably light and as a 'point and shoot', obtains reasonable pictures.<br />However to diverge from automatic control is fiddly and slightly masked by an iconic menu system - where a word would save several pictures.<br />The manufacturer's offering of 16Mb card + 2 alkaline batteries is woefully inadequate - I'd prefer it came with no card and save a few pennies.  32Mb is adequate; 64 is good.<br />Realistically, it has to be used with rechargeable batteries - a charging circuit in the camera would be a good start.<br />The software is abysmal - both Mac and PC.  The Webcam mode is useless and not available for Mac (no mention of this on the manufacturer's site); the 'fine pix' photoeditor is slow and painful (tip for mac users, just plug it in, copy the files over and use iphoto or graphics converter) - again save some money and don't even bother with the CD.  Also the Mac version refused to load until a lot of weird tricks were done.<br />The xD cards are small and fast but are yet another standard which is incompatible with Smart Media, Sony Memory Stick, Compact Flash etc...  Price seems reasonable.<br />Low light or indoor photographs are problematic using the automatic settings.<br />Overall not bad and an excellent 'starter' camera albeit with anoying limitations.","This is my first venture into digital photography. The Finepix 2650 hasn't disappointed me in any way. I did a bit of research before deciding to go with this camera. One of the requirements I needed was a camera with Optical zoom. This has both 3x's Optical along with 2x's Digital. I can't imagine needing more. I also wanted a Macro feature, which this has and is great. It's fairly intuitive and not too small. Some of the camera's I looked at seemed too small to operate comfortably. The price is reasonable and picture quality very satisfactory. Enjoy!","For the price, you can't beat this camera.  It's the lens that makes it.  It may not have all of the features of more expensive cameras, but ultimately it is the picture quality that is really important.  This camera really delivers great quality images.  In fact, I was astounded at how good they were.","I love this camera!! It takes fantastic photos, and is very easy to use!! Buy this, you won`t regret it!","I love this camera!! It takes fantastic photos, and is very easy to use!! Buy this, you won`t regret it!","I think you'll be hard-pressed to find a scathing review of this fine, useful, and relatively inexpensive camera.  I don't want to belabor that point.  But I do want to recommend buying this camera if you're looking for something that's multi-purpose and that doesn't drag your wallet down.  I bought the 2600 for a trip to Europe and it came in handy for all the times I took pictures.  Pictures are clear, crisp, and camera is lightweight.  You can play around with the easy-to-use menu to adjust to specific lighting conditions, but the Auto setting works great 95% of the time.  The one drawback, and perhaps this is a drawback of all digital cameras, is that this camera really draws on battery power.  I bought a pair of rechargeables for it, and the camera zapped the power IF I left them in constantly.  If I took them out after I wasn't planning to use my camera for a while, then the battery life would increase quite a bit.  Camera also zaps non-rechargeables as well.  So, do what I did and take your batteries out when you're not planning to shoot pictures for a while.  It's a little hassle, but the only negative for this camera.","For a 2.1 megapixel costing under [$$$], this camera takes GREAT pictures!  I've had mine for almost a year, and I love it!  It comes with a 16MB smart card (which holds about 40 pictures), but we've also bought a 128 MB smart card for the camera.  It allows us to take over 160 pictures!  This sure saves a lot on film!!  I highly recommend it for anyone who's looking for a good but easy-to-use camera!","Great features, loved the camera.  Good image quality, long battery life, best deal going on a 2 MB camera in this price range.<br />Unfortunately, the lens assembly jammed after less than 90 days (a few days before Christmas, no less) and Fuji had no customer service to speak of.  They didn't even bother to respond to my emails.<br />The camera has been back in Fuji Warranty Service's hands for almost a month and all we have gotten is acknowledgement of receipt.  Missed the digital camera for our son's birthday as well, hope we might see it back by Valentine's Day photos.<br />Great camera, poor QC and customer/warranty service.  My next camera will NOT be a Fuji.","I have given this camera three weeks.  I have seen nothing wrong with it really.  It has all of your basic features plus more!  And for the price, its unbeatable!  It also comes with a nice pocket battery charger, and nice software.  The LCD screen is a little annoying in low light conditions, but thats where the glass viewfinder comes in handy. It also has a twenty second movie clip function (with no sound, but so what?) that makes the camera extra fun.  So when you go on a vacation, this is all you`ll need. Go with this product, its an excellent choice!","This camera is better than the Fuji Finepix 2650.<br />It takes better pics, the LCD is bigger and is faster than the other one.<br />I have both and I thought 2650 should be better. I was wrong.<br />Besides, the Fuji Finepix 2650 uses xD cards for storage, more expensive and slower.<br />I like everything in this camera, great pictures. It comes even with rechargable batteries and a charger.<br />My only complaint: in sunny days it's imposible to see the LCD, imposible :-(","I've had this camera for 4 months now. I've put it through many different situations, so I can tell you a lot about it.<br />*the GOOD*<br />-VERY easy to use, EVERYONE can figure it out...<br />-3x optical zoom (with the digital) is very effective<br />-lightweight<br />-good price<br />-comes with batteries and charger<br />-comes with a decent memory card...I stuck with this card for like 3 months until getting a new 128 MB one. The 16 MB will suffice if you only take a few pictures a day, because I always just uploaded the pictures to my computer once I got home and cleared the memory card. However, I found this to be a problem because I wanted to take more pictures, for things such as parties...where I would take close to 100 pictures. Thus, I would definitely suggest getting a bigger memory card if you are going to be taking the camera to events.<br />-A lot of people are saying that the battery life [stinks]...I wouldn't say so. I tend to use the LCD screen a lot, and find that the batteries won't run out on me. What I do is just make sure that the batteries are fully charged before I take it to an event, and it always lasts the whole day. I have not bought another set of batteries, and I don't think I will unless go on vacation or something.<br />*and the BAD...*<br />-ACK the one thing that bugs me A LOT about this camera...the LCD screen is almost IMPOSSIBLE to see in the dark (as well as the in the bright sunlight). Yeah, sure you can use the regular viewhole, which is alright...but one reason to go digital is for the LCD when taking pictures. Along with this problem that people tend to forget is that if the LCD screen is too dark (or light), that means the videos you shoot with the camera are also too dark. That's okay if you don't use the video option, which I rarely do, but with those special occasions, I was unable to capture the moments due to the dark (light) conditions. There is a LCD brightness adjuster, but it tends to be not very effective...I've seen other cameras do a MUCH better job in these types of conditions...<br />-a bit chunky...though I put it in my purse or backpack, so I don't notice that much. But if you're a guy, I don't know if you would want this thing in your pocket.<br />Overall...I gave the camera 4 stars. For the price, I guess you get what you pay for. In general, a good camera for beginners, but I sometimes wish I had spent a little more and maybe had gotten a Canon or something (pricey!). It's up to you, but I would somewhat recommend the camera, keeping in mind my problem with it.<br />One more thing...I know that there is the new 2650 out. Though it may be cheaper straight out, KEEP IN MIND that it uses the new XD card, which is A LOT more EXPENSIVE!!! This one, the 2600, uses the SmartMedia, which is much more affordable. I got one at Costco Wholesale for a good price. Also, while this one comes with rechargable batteries and a charger, the 2650 comes only with ALKALINES! You DO NOT want those...so you will end up spending even more on getting new batteries and a charger!","This camera is a very good camera.  The only thing that I don`t really like about it is that the batteries die out a little fast, and the LCD screen can get dark at times.  But other than that this camera is the coolest!","Overall, a very nice camera.  Small, light, easy to use...  And the fact that it comes with a 16mb card, good quality rechargable batteries, AND a charger is just fantastic!<br />In general, image quality is very good.  Pictures are usually sharp and have pretty accurate colors.  The zoom is useful, and it's really easy to operate (although there's not a whole lot to it, so...).  The only real problem I have with the 2600 is its low light capabilities.  It doesn't like to autofocus in less than bright conditions.  In anything less than bright light, pictures come out grainy and faded.  The flash doesn't help a whole lot, either.  I'd say the effective range is probably 5 or 6 feet.<br />Overall, it's a GREAT camera for the money.  I've gotten several compliments about the image quality, and people are surprised that it came from a ($$$) point and shoot.  It's exactly what a casual digital photographer needs.  Just be careful about your light.","After doing an exhaustive search for the perfect digital camera I finally decided on this one.  On top of being 2.0 mega pixels it has a 3x optical zoom--at this price range that is a good combo.  The only other thing I would like to add to the many other reviews is the need for the ac adapter and a few extra batteries (it doesn't include the ac adapter and the batteries go quick, but last long enough for general/vacation/etc. picture taking.  This camera serves as a good pc-cam as well.  I am in a wheelchair (muscular dystrophy) and having limited physical ability, I found this camera to be very easy for me to use.  The LCD screen is big and clear enough for me to use the camera without having to make undue strain.  I was not disappointed at all in this product.  A very good buy!","I purchased this camera about 6 months ago when my daughter was born.  I absolutely love it and can't imagine going back to film again.  The camera is similar to a point and shoot film camera; it took all of about 10 minutes to learn how to use it.  There are some manual options but little is needed when the automatic functions work great.  For someone in search of an simple digital camera, this was perfect. It comes with rechargable batteries and charger; all we purchased separately was a camera case and a card reader from Circuit City)  which downloads your photos immediately. We never even used the USB port.<br />We have found that the image quality setting needs to be at the highest resolution to print a part of the image at 4x6 or the whole image up to an 8x10. I'm sure that any 2 mp camera works similarly.  With the ability to color correct and reduce red eye in our Microsoft Picture It! program, the photos look gorgeous when developed!<br />I have found only a few minor inconveniences. The camera lens cover needs to be opened as a separate step (sometimes it will accidently 'close' if your finger touches it) and the batteries share a compartment with the SmartMedia card (they may come out when the card is removed). the LCD monitor is hard to use in dim locations, but the view finder compensates when necessary. These inconveniences pale in comparison to the benefits. For the price... and features, it's wonderful. I would buy it again in a minute.  It has many features of more expensive cameras and takes great pictures","We love our FinePix! We bought it just before our 1st baby was born and she is the most photographed baby ever! The camera is as easy to use as the most simple of 35mm cameras, and the photos that we have shot are excellent, both on the PC and in print.<br />The only complaint is that it can take a little too long for it to be ready to use when we switch it on - mostly because we are trying to snap a baby who stays in the same pose for approximately 2 seconds!","I bought this camera for my dad's birthday and he absolutely loved it.  The only problem is that it eats batteries way too fast.  I used it for a wedding and I went through 4 sets of batteries to take about 50 pictures.  Other than that, the picture quality is excellent!  My pictures came out perfect and of much higher quality than I expected.  It is very easy to use, very small, and very lightweight.  I can't rate the software or the usb cable that came with it because I haven't used them.  Instead, I use a smartmedia usb drive to read the card.  That is the easiest way to go.<br />Other than the battery life, this is a wonderful little camera at a great price.  I highly recommend it!!!","I selected this camera for a number of reasons (resolution, optical zoom, no proprietary batteries, and a good price) and have been absolutely thrilled with it.  It was a snap to learn to use.  The software is pretty straightforward and painless to use.  The batteries last longer than I would have expected.<br />As with ANY digital camera, invest in rechargable batteries and a charger (Rayovac has a nice 1-hour charger), and a nice big memory card, and you'll be happy as a clam.  I know I am.","This is a great camera for those looking to replace their 35mm film cameras. The pictures have been excellent - even an 8x10 enlargement from a scenery shot came out looking great. At first I thought the power button separate from the lens cover would be annoying, but now I like that you can turn it on to, say, check the number of pictures left on your card without opening the lens cover. The battery life is amazing as well - took well over 100 pictures this past week before I had to swap in a new pair. And the included battery charger works great. (Note that you get fewer pictures the first few recharges of the batteries.)","Works great for me...I'm a beginner.  Got a fair deal.  Unfortunately, I didn't know how much I would miss sound when doing 20 second movie clips.  I still think I got a good camera for the price.","With the plethora of digital cameras available on the market, making a selection can be a daunting task.  They come in all shapes and sizes, with an assortment of different features, and various types of memory media and associated software.  For the thoughtful consumer, the whole task can become an exercise in information overload.<br />Traditional photography is a hobby of mine, and I own several 35mm single lens reflex (SLR) type cameras, and a couple of point and shoots.  My intention is to purchase a pro level digital SLR, when the prices come down a bit.  In the meantime, I was looking for an inexpensive digital point and shoot.<br />My main consideration was price, and I wanted the most camera I could get for around $200.  It seemed that a 2 megapixel camera would be the most I could afford.  Reading numerous reviews, I quickly became overloaded with data, and bounced around between several brands and models before finally choosing the Fuji 2600Z.  This solid entry level, digital point and shoot camera has a 3X optical zoom lens, which provides performance, equivalent to a 38-114mm lens in a regular film camera.  Autofocus is crisp, and Image quality is excellent throughout the focal range.<br />The camera has very basic features.  The flash mode has five options, auto flash, forced flash, suppressed flash, red-eye reduction and slow synchro flash (for night shooting).  For most indoor applications, using flash is typically recommended, and unit has so far produced excellent results indoors when flash is used.  There is a macro mode, which also produces great images.  Range is listed as from 4 to 30 inches from the lens.  In timer mode, the camera operates after the standard 10 second delay.  All options are accessed via the menu, which is displayed on the rear 1.8\" LCD screen.  Other options include image quality (image file size), power save option, and setting the date and time.  The LCD like those for most digital cameras, is difficult to see in bright daylight, so changing settings can be difficult in that situation.<br />The 2600Z has three modes, \"still image\" (camera), \"playback\" (image display and video playback), and \"movie\" mode.  These are pretty self-explanatory.  In movie mode, the camera will capture up to 20 seconds of video.  In playback mode, you may watch your video, or view the images retained in the camera's memory.  Still images can be viewed either one by one, full screen, or up to a maximum of nine mini images at once, on a three by three array on the LCD.  Even at the reduced size, images are easily recognizable, and the colors are true.  When in full screen viewing mode, you can also zoom in, and then pan the image.  Unwanted images can of course be erased.<br />That is about it for the features.  The camera comes with a 16MB smart media card, two 1700mAh AA size NiMH batteries and a charger, special USB cord, strap, and a CD with software for downloading images from the camera.  The software takes a while to install, but if all goes well, then your camera will download your images very quickly.  You will probably want a larger size card, but 16MB is not bad for a starter, and will hold about 45 medium quality images.  Supposedly the camera will accept cards up to a maximum of 128MB.  The rechargeable batteries, are a nice addition to the package, and the battery life of the NiMH's has been very good so far.  There is also abundant documentation for both the camera, and software provided with the product.<br />As this is the first digital I've owned, I don't have a lot to compare it to.  I have been using it for only around three weeks, but so far I have no major complaints, and have been pleasantly surprised at the image quality.  It does what I need, and is so simple to operate.  Most users should have no major problems.  Within the limitations of its design, the camera delivers on all counts, and provides value for the money, that equals or surpasses most other cameras in its class.  The camera is a bit thicker than some other models, so pick one up and handle it to see if it feels comfortable in your hands.  Because of its thickness, the camera may not slide smoothly into some tight pockets.<br />This model has been on the market for a while, and may become available at bargain prices as it is phased out.  If you're not seeking the newest model, and want a basic point and shoot, at a reasonable price, my recommendation would be to wait for a sale and pick one up.  Then go and have some fun, taking photos you never dreamed of taking before.","This is my first digital camera.  Very easy to use.  My only complaint is the red-eye reduction.  Even with this on, my pics still have red eyes (most of the time).  The software that comes with the camera is ok, but limited as to what you can do with the pictures.","I was doing some preliminary research and stumbled upon this camera on Amazon.com at a greatly reduced price.  A friend who manages a photo shop had mentioned Fuji as a top supplier of entry-level cameras, so I took the plunge.  I couldn't be happier.  Low resolution images are generally about 125 kb and look great.  I've had none of the issues with low light/indoor settings that I've seen in other reviews.  Uploading to a PC is a piece of cake, and the Fuji software doesn't even come into play (at least not on my computer - the Microsoft wizard just takes over the process).  Totally idiot-proof, in my opinion.","I searched a lot among its peers and had second thoughts for it looked cheaper. It's been 2 months since my purchase and I am amazed by the quality of the pictures. You can see the pores a person's face or you can totally reproduce print pictures by taking their pictures in the close up \"macro\" mode. Works fantastic under any light. Looks way cuter and sharper than sony and other competitors. 2 negative points: Battery runs out real fast. Click to picture taking there's about half a second delay. Not good for sports or jumping kitten pics.","You can not find any better point-and-shoot cameras than this:<br />- Affordable price<br />- 2 megapix which is more than enough for printing, and the photo quality is really good.<br />- superb features including 3X zooming and PCCAM<br />- One more great thing is that use can even use ALKALINE battery when your Ni-Mh battery runs out(at that mode you can not use the LCD screen, but you can still take photo).","This camera got badmouthed on Cnet for allegedly having a really weak flash. However, the one I got had a blinding flash and was awesome for low light picture taking. The only problem is that I keep accidentally sliding the slide the covers the lens while I take photos, and that knocks the lens back into the camera body.<br />The desktop software is pretty average and the camera gets pretty good battery life. Buy a 128mb card with this camera and you've got yourself a very good camera.","The Fuji 2600 is our first digital camera and it is everything that we expected.  We are casual users but really enjoy all the great features that are included in this camera.  Right out of the box we were taking beautiful pictures - indoors and out and we are having a blast with this thing.  Battery life is more than we expected and the picture quality is first rate.  Great camera at an excellant price.  If you are looking for your first digital camera or a very good digital camera for everyday and vacation use, the Fuji 2600 is hard to beat - and the price is outstanding.","I am happy with its performance.","Be sure to call Fuji tech support and have them walk you through the paces in order to properly install the software.  They hid a file that they shouldn't have and its fairly easy to fix.  Why they don't have the fix on their website is a mystery.","I was shopping for a 3 megapixel camera but after reading the specs on this unit and associated reviews, accepted the 2.1 megapixel in favor of a better lens system (and stay in my price range). Great camera takes excellent pictures, small and rugged. Limited to 2X, would prefer 3X. Lens cover has annoying habit of nudging closed while I am operating. Software is a little overdone. All-in-all a good buy, versital, convenient and good kick around camera for vacation use.","I bought this camera last year and I am keeping using it more than my Canon EOS 35mm, and the results I've obtain are more than I expected from it. Actually I have keep shooting almost every day and the results are as good as the ones I get from film, including the fact it's easier to handle the pictures in a digital way to display it in my homepage and send them via email whoever I want to. In few words, I'm very happy with it. Enjoy it.","I have been using this camera for a couple of weeks now and I am very pleased with the results.<br />I kept debating on whether or not to go up to a higher megapixal range, but the great price is what made me decide to take a chance with this one. The resolution is fine for most any ordinary photo situations.<br />After all, even with a 35mm, how often do you blow up your shots larger than 8x10 or even 5x7 for that matter? If you don't plan on printing any larger than 8x10 then 2 megapixels should be fine.<br />Positive features:<br />*Great picture quality<br />*Small and lightweight<br />*Comes with rechargable batteries and charger (the rechargables will save you a lot of money in the long run)<br />*Software is very easy to use<br />*Flash has it's limitations, but has not been a problem for me so far.<br />*Comes with free 16mb memory card, however I recommend getting an additional card (at least 64mb). A 64mb card will hold nearly 100 shots even at the highest resolution!<br />Negative features:<br />*Uhhh, can't think of any (not yet anyway)<br />It is perfect for someone who isn't that familiar with digital cameras because it is very easy to use and get great shots with. It is definitely not confusing at all (software or camera).<br />Hope this info helps..","As the price has fallen on this camera, Fuji has become a better competitor in this crowded field. The 2600 has some nice features, but virtually none that most every other camera in this range doesn't have. On the down side, the feel is a bit flimsy and the controls are fairly limited (it is pretty much an automatic-only camera). Most annoyingly, especially if you're used to the Olympus clamshell design, this camera can be closed without shutting off the power, making it a bit of a battery-killer. Anyway, it's not a bad camera, it's just not an outstanding one. For the same price, I'd prefer the Nikon 775.","We love this little camera.  We were a bit hesitant getting into digital but now we're glad we did!  This camera was the perfect way to get started!!! Setup is a breeze and the camera is very easy to use. The software is not great but no complaints here.  Runs with no problems on Windows 2000.  I noticed that some reviewers have complained about indoor shots with this camera but I must say ours have all turned out perfect.  It is made of plastic but is very solid and has a good quality feel and look...should be durable enough in regular use.  Good way to go for a first digital camera.","Well, I'm going to keep it short.  I have had a Cannon Elan 35mm with a Tamron 28-200 mm lens for the past 10 years.  I love it but it's heavy artillery.  Wanted a digital.  Requirements were 2 MP min., very small and light, min. 3x optical zoom.  The 2600 was made to order.  Had it for two months and I have yet to find something to complain about.  On the unexpected plus side, I was amazed at the macro.  I was selling a ram chip on ebay that measure about 2 by .75 inches.  Shot it with this camera from a few inches away and you could read the etchings on the chip.  I was amazed.  I am no expert in digital photography but I would and am recommending it w/o reservation.","I'll have to say that the price was the main factor for getting this camera...at first.<br />I've been researching digital camera's for a while now and like every other electronic toy I have now, all the ones I WANTED were [monetary value]and above. Well, that wasn't feasible so I decided to get real and start looking for camera's with 2-3 megapixels.<br />This one is a true winner! Great camera for the beginner, and the macro feature produces such nice shots, you can almost feel the subject! My wife is entering a dish into a local cooking contest and you need to submit a picture with your online registration. Anyway, the picture of the dish (I'm sworn to not say what it is) was so vibrant and tasty looking, you could almost taste it! I can even see the cheese bubbling in the picture, I wish I could post it for you!<br />Great affordable fist digital camera. Yes, there are many camera's out there that will do what this one will and more, but none for the price! Get this one while you can! The holidays are coming up ya' know!","This camera is, simply put, great! The only beef I have with it is that it is so easy to have an accident. One small slip and you end up erasing or reformatting all your photos. It has to be the most frustrating experience. No matter how careful one is, it always seems to happen at an important event (X-mas, weddings etc.)<br />It would be great is there was additional security features to reduce the risk of deleting one's photos.<br />I also find that the Finepix software is less than user friendly. It works fine as long as there no glitches, but God help you if there is a problem. In my case, it couldn't find the file???. Read all the brochures, went through all the menus. no luck.<br />I'd have to say, unless your tech gifted, just take your photos and have them developed. Don't try to be fancy and touch anything. or better yet, get another camera","Since the other reviews seem to rave about this camera--an I agree with the raves, i'm writing to comment on use with my Macintosh. It's seamless integration.  I took my pictures, connected via USB, and iPhoto automatically opened.  I clicked \"import\", and then \"publish\", and my photos were on my web site, that easy! I'm thrilled with the price and ease of use of this camera.","I received this camera just 2 days ago and now I am already in love with it. It does the job very very well. I even tried to turn off the light and took the picture to see if it was bad indoors as some other said on Amazon. You know, it worked perfectly well thanks to the flash.<br />The pictures turn out to be good indoors and even under very dime light. The price/quality is good. I will definitely recommend it to friends.","The LCD is very poor indoors. This camera can only be used outdoors if not too sunny. Maybe it is the camera but I called Fuji and they told me this is normal.<br />I would like to use the LCD more, thats one of the reasons that I purchased it!","Partially basing on the high user rating listed on the amazon,i purchased this camera about 3 months ago. With a good value,Fuji FinePix 2600 camera is beautiful and easy to use ,and the supporting software is pretty easy to use.","Initially I got my Fujifilm Digital FinePix 2600 Zoom to get pictures of the family in e-mail, but after just a short time I have diecovered what outstanding sharp pictures this camera takes.  The special features, i.e. micro-photo and self timer, with the various flash capabilities and telephoto features have made this camera the first I reach for when taking pictures not only of the family, but landscapes, live action and special events of all types.  I am very pleased with this camera and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a digital.","I really like this one.It is one of the best for its price range.<br />A friend just bought Sony DSC-P51 for [money]+tax, which comes only with 2x digital zoom with same resolution. I compare both cameras and mine is the better one, and the cheaper one. And Fuji is not a no-name brand especially when it comes to cameras.<br />Pictures that I've taken; indoor or outdoor, are crystal clear so far. In one picture in e Normal quality mode, you can even see the pores on a person's skin. Way better than my conventional camera with same zoom features. Plus this one is loaded with options like zooming on objects behind glass,taking  pictures of people at night WITH the city lights visible and alternative image focusing etc.<br />The drawbacks are: Its menu is a little complicated and I had hard time installing the USB dirver to make it work. I actually had to make a google search to find 3 different USB drivers until the computer recognized the camera. All in all it is a great buy!","I bought the Fuji Finepix from Amazon after spending a lot of time comparing reviews and prices.  It sounded like it offered the best value for money.  However, when I received it I couldn't help but be a little disappointed.  Although the camera is quite easy to use, and the pictures look good, it's just a little bit too big!  I really wanted a simple camera that I can carry around easily and take a quick snap of something that takes my fancy.  Because of it's size, I don't think the Fuji Finepix is quite what I need.<br />For other people, the Fuji may be appropriate.  However, I have returned mine and ordered the more expensive Canon Powershot instead.  It costs... more, but it is about half the size of the Fuji Finepix - much easier to carry around unobtrusively.  Picture quality seems about the same, and the Canon has more features, so I think I will be happier with that instead.","Recommend based on price and features, super easy to use with the mac.  At first I got blurry close-up pictures of my boy, but putting the camera in Macro mode for close ups fixed it for me.","I have been shopping for my first didgital camera for 2 weeks, comparing reviews, features and anything else avaliable! I settled on this camera because it had the features I had decided I needed and I happened into a great deal price-wise. I'm not one to read every word of a manual,( only when absolutely necessary!) but this camera was easy to figure out with a little input from the manual and a knowledgeable salesman. The software however, was another story! Once I actually took my first picture and was able to get the software working though, I was really impressed! The self timer was easy to master- the options are easily applied and work! -and the battery life is surprisingly good compared to the horror stories told in most reveiws for digital cameras! The camera has an automatic feature that allows picture taking in low light to be as easy as in full light;  and since I'm still new at this, I'm certain it will become old hat in no time to use the other features (I've tried them all with the help of the manual, but I'm sure the manual will collect dust soon!). The software was a challenge, but as I write this review I have to admit most software that proclaims to be Windows XP compatible is a challenge, so I can't say with any certainty if the problem lies with Fuji or Windows XP. All in all, I'm more than satisfied with my purchase, to date. The camera itself is small yet sturdy and the results are beyond what I expected after the all of the comparisons between 2 and 3 mp's I was subjected to by the various salespeople. The pictures are sharp, clean and the color is great! (and it's easily enhanced right on the LCD screen if you don't like it!) Fuji is definitely a viable product for this price! I would highly recommend this camera as a first time camera to those who are somewhat knowledgeable in the tech-field, however if you're like the woman standing next me when I bought mine who was ...'loooking for a camera for her husband that had no difficulty in using with his computer...' look to one of the cameras with a docking station and single button load to the pc. This isn't technologically challenging (or I for one would've returned mine!) but it does require some knowledge and experience with installing and running (expecially with the windows XP version!)programs and connecting hardware properly. (I consider myself not quite in the 'for Dummies' arena, but not not that far from it, if that helps).","I found the Fuji 2600 Zoom a perfect digital camera for a novice user like myself. Easy to set up and operate, this is the camera for those looking to buy in the low to middle price range.","I've had this camera for a couple of weeks and it really has greatly exceeded my expectations. The following will be random thoughts so far about the product:<br /><br />1. The camera is even smaller than I expected, which is certainly a good thing. For those who do not want to carry around a bulky camera, this is excellent. It fits comfortably in my top shirt pocket.<br /><br />2. The build is fairly strong, although not terrific. As with any piece of equipment, you have to be careful to not drop it.<br /><br />3. The camera takes 2 AA rechargable batteries. The battery life in the camera is impressive. On a recent day, I took 152 pictures (using the LCD screen for some shots, only looking through the viewfinder for others, no flash) and the camera still wasn't showing \"low battery\" at the end of the day. These batteries cost about [$-$]each battery and are available at CompUSA or most speciality camera stores. A battery charger is also included.<br /><br />4. The memory card slot is a little risky. By that I mean you have to be careful when putting it in. The cards are delicate and to put them in and pull them out requires not a huge amount of care, but you can't be walking and change it while you walk.<br /><br />5. The camera is wonderfully user friendly. There is a manual lens cap of sorts (slide it over, it clicks twice and you're ready to shoot, turn off the camera and then slide it back). The LCD screen offers bright, easy-to-read options. You can control the flash (red-eye control, etc.) and adjust things like white level/EV. The camera is a max of 2 megapixels, but the user can adjust the levels - 2 megapixel fine, normal, basic and then 1 megapixel normal/basic and finally, VGA (which is something like 120k, I think) The LCD screen is also a very nice size. While it's not easy to take the memory card out on-the-fly, it's very simple to quickly change up quality, effects, etc.<br /><br />6. The camera can take 20 seconds of video. These files are about 3 megabytes in size and you can take multiple little videos, depending on the memory card.<br /><br />7. The camera includes a 16 megabyte memory card, which is very nice to start off, although I highly recommend at least a 64 meg. card. (at the lowest resolution, the camera can take over 400 pictures on a 64mb card)<br /><br />8. The LCD screen offers how many images are left, even when you switch to another resolution.<br /><br />9. The camera only takes SmartMedia cards. Still, amazon.com, for example, has plenty of these cards to choose from and they're not terribly expensive.<br /><br />10. Overall, an excellent camera. While this maybe not be profession-level, it takes excellent pictures that make for strong prints.","This is my first Digital camera, and I'm very happy with it. It takes great pictures, easy to use, Easy USB transfer to my computer, takes only 2 AA batterys which last a long time in my opinion, also came with it's own battery charger and 2 NI-CAD batterys. Mine came with a 16mb card and a 32 mb smartmedia I got the 32mb card through a specail deal. So I'd recommend buying a larger smartmedia card right away or even a few smaller cards. rather than a 128 buy two 64  mb ...","I bought this camera a few months ago as my very first digital camera. I did my research, read reviews, and checked out the prices of all the other 2MP cameras. I had thought about buying a Canon Digital Elph, but a number of factors pointed me to this camera. The very first thing I noticed is that it holds well and is comfortable to hold. Many of the other \"boxy\" type cameras almost made my hand cramp they were poorly ergonomically designed. Then as I played with the camera more I noticed the features it had for a relatively reasonable price. I could get a 2MP camera for about the same price as a high-end 1MP, and without all the customization features that an amateur photographer like me isn't going to use very often, if at all. In the 2 months that I've used this camera, I have been pleasantly surprised.<br />Sure this camera has its drawbacks, but what camera is perfect? Some of the biggest complaints I have are: the display is almost impossible to see in direct sunlight, the flash can be overpowering in certain situations, and you will get massive blur if you're not careful in non-flash situations.  Given all that, I found the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks of this great camera.  No camera is perfect, but this one is perfect for me and any other ameature looking for a camera they can just pick up, turn on, and shoot away.<br />If you would like to see some examples of the kinds of pictures this camera takes, check out my website at [...]","I love this camera.  I wanted to get into digital imaging but didn't want a lot of complicated settings.  It was perfect and got me started with some great pictures.  I have since moved up to the 2800 but would have been satisfied with this one.","Would recommend to anybody!  Great camera, easy to use!  Takes incredible pictures for the money.  I am very pleased with this camera.  Very simple to use!  The LCD screen has a great picture, and is easy to see.","... this is a very nice camera.  It is a nice package, comes with the rechargeable batteries and a charger and 16mb smartcard.  This better than most digital cameras esp in this price range.  The picture quality is very good, if you have a good quality printer you will get nice prints with this camera.  You do have to hold the camera still or many of the pictures will blurr, and pictures taken at night are dark (but most can be repaired with basic picture software).  You will probably want to get some additional photo software, since the included software is bare bones.  Overall I am enjoying this camera very much and would definetly recommend this camera to my friends and family.","This is a great little camera and I would recommend it to anyone. Of all the ones I checked out, this one had a larger LCD screen than most. Its easy to use and when I first bought it I was taking great quality pictures in the first 10 mins. I have had no problems downloading the pictures onto my PC, its quick and foolproof. The only problem I found after downloading the  files to the PC is that if you modify them in anyway using another pic processor then you cannot view them again using the finepix viewer that is supplied with the camera.<br />It's best to only use the correct re-chargeable batteries. Standard alkaline batteries only last a few minutes. I only managed 30 minutes on super heavy duty batteries. Only use alkaline batteries as a stand-by.<br />The lens cover can be a bit annoying. It has 2 \"click positions\" when you open the cover. When the cover is fully open it overlaps the edge of the case and when you hold it in the normal way, as you would with any other camera, it's easy to nudge the cover with you finger, which causes the lens to withdraw back into the camera.<br />Other than than these minor points I am more than happy with my purchase of the Fuji 2600.","I consider myself a digital camera novice.  Here is my review for what it is worth...<br />To get a good picture you have to hold the camera completely still, or you get a blurry picture.  This is almost impossible to do since the process of pressing the button makes the camera move.  I think this is happens since the camera only has an ISO of 100.  Most cameras in this price range only have 100 as well.  Assuming you can hold it still, it does take a nice picture.<br />The back screen is hard to see in any conditions (even when adjusting brightness).  When you view the picture after taking it, you don't know if it is a good one or bad on.<br />The part to open the battery is on the bottom, usually where your thumb is and I find that it pops open if you aren't careful with handling.","I've seen many digital cameras and this one is really worth the value.  I've been looking for one for the longest time and said all I needed really was a 2.0 Mega Pixel camera. This camera has a lot.  Pictures are taken quickly and they are pretty clear and crisp for a 2 mega pixel.  The LCD is somewhat contrasty and it isn't the best in dark situations.  Also, the menu surfing can be burdening but I am okay with it.  Good price, good value, good camera overall.  But you might want to check out the new Nikon 2000 also.  Has same features, except the video mode records audio whereas this one does not.  It's pretty much the same price as this one.","Just received this today and it's worth the hupla! Was up and running in less than 10 minutes. Already shot about 20 stills and tried out the 20 second vidoe feature. Works like a charm. Camera is small and would be easy to take anywhere. I also tried out the web cam feature and I must say it makes my [other brand] webcam look horrible. I will be ordering the AC adapter asap so I can use it as a webcam as well. Printed out a couple 5 x 7's on my [printer] and they look great. The rechargable batteries are a nice touch and included. .. Software installed on my HP PIII Win Xp system without a problem and as I said the webcam feature worked well also. Well be keeping this item busy!","I bought this camera for my daughter and am tempted to buy one for myself except for one annoying problem.  This camera will not autofocus in low light conditions.  It actually states this in the manual.","Like:<br />1. small camera, light, 2 batteries<br />2. easy to use<br />3. LCD is 1.8', with a glass cover<br />4. nice price<br />Dislike:<br />1. Two batteries won't give you a strong flash.<br />2. Movie doesn't have sound (I don't like dumb movie)","I wasn't happy with results of Sony and HP digital cameras that my friends had. So, I was skeptical about purchasing a digital Camera.<br />That's why I decided to purchase a camera from a company which is known for photography.<br />I am very happy with this product.<br />Good Points :<br />* Excellent quality of photos.<br />* Very simple to operate.<br />* Auto mode takes very good photos.<br />* Great photos even when there is less light.<br />* LCD Display makes it very easy to compose a photo and you can't go wrong.<br />* 3x Optical zoom really makes difference.<br />* Software interface with PC is very simple.<br />What I didn't like :<br />* Drains batteries. But I guess that's true with all digital cameras.<br />Further Recommendations :<br />* Purchase an extra 128 MB Memory card and a pair of rechargable NiMH batteries (1700 mAh) and you are all set.","I did my share of research before buying this gem. Here's what I have to say after 3 months, I hope you find it useful.<br />Since, most people are in a hurry, let me keep this short:<br />LIKES:<br />1. Terrific value, the *best* in the 2 Megapixel range!<br />2. Good quality pictures across different light levels and good colour reproduction<br />3. Small size - one of the smaller ones in this range<br />4. Packs enough features for people wanting a point and shoot camera. Useful 3x Optical Zoom works well<br />5. Easy to use buttons and LCD Menus<br />6. Lasts long on the supplied cells (which are very good ones even though they take their time - 4 hours - charging). I have taken over 200 shots with average usage of Zoom, Flash and LCD when they are fully charged<br />7. Complete accessory kit including the 16 MB smart media card. ...<br />8. Absolutely reliable, haven't had a glitch in taking 1500 shots or so<br />DISLIKES:<br />1. Just a minor niggle is that I had to get used to the location of the battery cover, it opened by accident more than once. Once you get used to it though, you wouldn't mind it<br />2. I find myself using the optical zoom a lot (dont use digital zoom). To those having a flexible budget, I would strongly recommend the Fuji Finepix 2800Z with its 6x optical zoom and voice annotation features. It is slightly bulkier though, so you have to weigh things up<br />3. You cannot snap on additional lenses to this camera, some of its peers support this feature. So if you want to use wide-angle or additional telephoto lenses, you'll be disappointed<br />OVERALL:<br />Unless you have the budget to go for the Finepix 2800Z with 6x optical zoom, this is the best camera to buy in the 2 Megapixel range","I did a fair amount of research prior to deciding on the Fuji FinePix 2600.  Other top contenders were the Canon Powershot A40 and the Sony DSC-P51. I used these reviews to make my decision, so I figured I'd offer my opinion as well.<br />My primary use for a camera is for family photos, vacation shots, etc.  I wanted a camera that was mostly automatic with some minor manual controls.  The camera had to be very user friendly.  And lastly, I wanted a digital camera that was pretty much going to replace my 35 mm camera...I wanted a camera that would produce 4x6 and 5x7 prints with quality as good as (or better than) my existing 35 mm camera.  After using this camera A LOT in the past week, I have to say that I am extremely satisfied with the camera and the 4x6 prints are REMARKABLE.  The prints are very crisp with excellent color, both indoor and out.  The prints do not look grainy at all like you might expect from a digital camera.  I used the highest resolution setting for the photos and had them printed at a local camera shop lab(Cord Camera).  I did not work in unique lighting situations, but for fairly normal lighting, the photos were great.<br />The software was easy to load (Win 98), but it's more of a photo management rather than a photo editing software.  You can dump and save your photos, crop photos, or change the resolution, but the software does not allow you to do black & white, change contract, or other editing features.<br />Movie mode is cool, although no sound.  However, the .AVI files are saved as Windows Media Player files but the loaded media player that is installed with the software would not play them.  I had to watch the movies in the FinePix software or load them into Quicktime which was a bit of a pain.  I think in order for me to  get the Windows Media Player to play the files, I'd have to download a file off the internet.  It would be free but would take forever with my slow dial-up connection...not worth it for me.  I didn't buy this camera for the movie mode, so this slightly annoying way of viewing the movie files wasn't worth me worrying about too much.<br />The camera is very easy to learn to use.  A few possible negatives that I can report is the fact that the camera actually takes the photograph a fraction of a second after you push down the button (which is a bit frustrating when photographing a 3 year old that won't sit still!) and the fact that the LCD screen is tough to see in bright sunlight or dark conditions.  But I think these two factors are issues with most (or all?) digital cameras rather than just this specific FinePix 2600.<br />Things that helped me make my decision over the Canon A40 and the Sony P51:<br />1.  Takes 2 batteries whereas the Canon takes 4.<br />2.  Batteries are rechargeable and a charger is included whereas the Canon and Sony don't include rechargeables/charger.<br />3.  Came with a 16 MB memory card whereas the Canon came with an 8 MB card.<br />I realize that the above items are minor but they are important considerations when it comes down to upfront cost of the camera and supplies.  If the Fuji FinePix had not produced such AWESOME quality photo prints, I probably would have returned it and tried the Sony or tried a 3 MP camera.  But after my first development order and a few days of playing around with the camera, I was totally hooked on the Fuji.  I truly love this camera and would recommend it to anyone.  This camera may motivate me to become more of a camera hobbiest rather than just a casual camera user.","After a lot of research and trying several other models I decided to buy this camera.  I did not find anything in the price range with as many features.  Everything you need to get started is included.<br />I use it for a general purpose snapshot camera and have been extremely pleased with the results.","Hi, Folks<br />I would like to recommend to purchase the Fuji FinePix 2600 2MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom by Fujifilm product.<br />The price is reasonable for the consumer to choose, also the product is updated to the model and the market.<br />The most important is the good image with the Fujifilm product for the excellent picture to the users.<br />Lastly I highly suggest to the users that the most important thing is take notice of the light when you are taking the pictures.  Otherwise is effect is not good for the pictures.","Need I say more?<br />I got this camera and was up and running in a couple minutes...and I have absolutely NO experience with digital cameras whatsoever. I just plugged it into my iMac WITHOUT THE USE OF ANY INSTALLATION CDs. It instantly recognised and sucked the shots in. It has a nice display...and talk about the price...It's the greatest bang for the buck with this digicam. I'm happy about it and wish I'd gotten it earlier...<br />Image quality is almost professional, or at least it's pro enough for me. It's easy to learn the features and you can master most in about an hour of fooling around with it...Strangely though, my batteries are still up.(Knocks board)<br />Anyway, I've got more to do than write this review...Am goin' snappin' with my new Fuji FinePix 2600. I give it a full 5 out of 5 stars.","This Fuji Finepix camera is very good, especially for beginners who want a simple, \"goof-proof\" digital camera.  I've had the camera for about 3 weeks now, and the pictures have come out sharp, with excellent color and detail.  The flash is remarkably good for such a small and inexpensive camera.<br />The 3x optical zoom works well, and the autofocus is a step up from some of the \"focus-free\" models.  The LCD screen is bright and clear, and the 20-second movie clip mode is a fun feature.  Overall a good camera and a great value - it even comes with rechargeable batteries, a charger, a 16MB smartmedia card, and a USB cable!  These are things that can cost extra with other models.  About the only thing it doesn't come with is a carrying case...  I use the Lowepro Z20 pouch and it fits the camera nicely (and it's only [$$$] bucks on Amazon).<br />The only negatives I've found?  First, the viewfinder is positioned right on top of the LCD screen, resulting in a lot of nose-print smudges on the screen.  Secondly, this camera is geared more towards people who want true \"point and shoot\" photography - it gives you very little manual control over settings such as aperture, shutter speed, etc.  If you're looking for more control, you'll probably want to look elsewhere.  However, if you want an excellent camera that consistently takes good pictures, this Fuji is a great buy.","I purchased my FujiFilm FinePix 2600Z... I had no idea on its performance and never read any reviews on it... while waiting for its arrival from USA, I scoured the web for its reviews. AND I THINK THERE IS SOMEONE ABOVE GUIDING ME for when i got the chance to \"play\" with it, THE REVIEWS ARE VERY MUCH CORRECT!<br />For its price and performance, it beats a lot of similar digicams... if your budget is within US$300, never hesitate to consider this camera and put it top on your candidates for your purchase...<br />the only complain i have for this, though, is its low performance in dark environments (evening shots, dimly lit places, etc)... but is very superb in well-lighted environment...<br />also, consider adding a pair of 1700mAh NiMh batteries and a 64MB SmartMedia Card (82 785kb-JPEG shots at its highest resolution).<br />4 stars only because its performance is below par at evening shots....","This is a great camera.  I spent a bit of time researching for a digital camera and decided on the Fuji 2600 due to features and price.  I like the option of capturing 2-mil or 1-mil pixels plus the fine, normal, and basic settings.  I did upgrade to the 128 meg smart card which allows up to 389 pictures at the 1-mil normal setting and 166 pictures at the 2-mil fine setting.<br />After testing each capture setting on the same picture, I can notice a difference if you zoom in to 500% on the monitor screen, but printing the pictures side by side at 3x5, you can hardly tell the difference.<br />This camera (along with all digitals from what I understand) does eat batteries if you use the display on the back alot.  The enclosed rechargeable batteries were a big selling point for me.  I do plan on purchasing the plug-in adapter to preserve battery life while downloading to my computer.<br />Included software is fairly good and easy to use.  No problems at all on XP professional.<br />After one week and 100's of pictures, I do love this camera.","In a word--easy. Even a techophobe can handle this camera.<br />I am very pleased with the quality of the pictures.  It stores pictures quickly, which is a big plus.  It allowed me to catch some great firework shots! Have had many compliments on the photos already.  The USB connection is ultra fast and worked with my XP operating system just fine. I don't need one of those SmartReaders, as suggested by some reviewers--it took very little time to transfer the files to my computer. So try it on your PC/Mac before you buy one, so you don't make the purchase if you don't need it. The whole camera to PC process is very self-sufficient, does the work for you--you just have to plug it in and turn it on and press auto-save. Piece of cake.<br />Two small drawbacks--no case is included (note: no AC either, but it comes with batteries and a charger) and also I had to mess with the brightness of a few indoor shots. But no big deal.  Also, for doing movie clips, I don't think you can choose to keep the flash on constant. So make sure what you are \"filming\" is well lit.<br />Overall, I give this item an enthusiastic recommendation.","This is our family's first digital camera and I am pleased with the Fuji 2600. Photos are clear, operation is intuitive and the accessories package is outstanding: NiMH charger, and 16Mb SmartCard. The included photo-management software is elementary and limited, though serviceable.<br />My main complaint is that the battery cover is poorly engineered and pops open at the slightest touch. I was talking pictures at the beach and the hatch popped open, dropping the batteries into the water. I have solved this by super-gluing velco strips to the camera body, but my wife says I uglied-up the camera. But look at the bright side, I said: Now our camera is less tempting to thieves.","I bought this camera after checking out all the similar ones in the range.  This camera is very good with very good pics.  I take lots of pictures and love it!<br />GET IT NOW!","Being compulsive, I read every review when comparing the 2600 to the 2800. I have a FinePix 1400 which I got about two years ago, and have always been pleased with its reliability and great clarity and color. I bought the 2600 for my wife, and she is now stuck with the 1400, which she just loves. What I really like about the 2600 is the easy to read menu (much easier than previous models with larger print and most things are color coded)and the positive double snap of the clamshell lens cover which lets you know positively when it is open and shut. I have always liked Fuji's quality and reliability.<br />As you know, the 2800 is hard to see thru the viewfinder in anything but bright light. I tried it at a camera store. I liked that they are trying to get to a digital version of an SLR, but the 2800 is not it. Get the 2600, it is like an updated version of the 1400. The Fuji lens is I think the best of all brands. It is really sharp in all compression ratios. For those who are picky about scratches on the plastic body, I am told there is a polyester soft type cover available for the body to help with this. I would definitely advise a 128 MB card, well worth it.<br />As to the bottom loading battery and memory card, I have never had it open up on me, as some say has happened to them. It seems to close just fine.","I bought this camera based on reviews I read here on Amazon.  We were getting ready to go to visit family in Hawaii and I wanted a small sized, but not small in features digital camera that would take great pictures and be easy to use, especially in sending to the computer.  It arrived on time, and I practiced a day or two before we left.  I took my software and cable with me to Hawaii and installed in on my sister's computer.  This way I could email them home and to friends.  The software worked great, the rechargeable batteries are a must.  It's a great camera for the novice digital user, but better than beginner cameras.  One recommendation though -- READ THE MANUALS!  I should have read them on the plane, not as I was trying to take pictures.","Out of all the digital cameras in it's range, you can't get more for the price, and style.  Most cheap digital cameras are pretty ugly, and don't offer as much mega pixels for a comparable price.  This is the best deal around.","This is the first time I have written an on-line review of a product.  They have been helpful to me though so hopefully this will assist others in their research as well.<br />This is a great digital camera for those wanting a point and shoot type that takes fantastic shots.  I was stunned by the clarity of the photos in nearly all shooting environments.  I have been mainly using the lowest res. setting (VGA)and still find the picture quality superb.  I would recommend this setting if you are wanting to get more shots out of the Smart Media card you are using.  With the 16MB card that comes with it you can get up to 122 shots using the VGA setting.  This is best for e-mail & web pages.  As others have mentioned though, you can set for a higher quality and always reduce later for this.  If you use the 1M setting (default)you can shoot 49 pix, 2M setting 39.  My purchase came with a 64MB card as well.  Having a 64MB will give you the following:  VGA - 497 shots, 1M - 198 shots, 2M - 159 shots.  These are just some guidelines however as the quality size can also be changed from Fine, Normal & Basic.  Above counts are at Normal mode.<br />I am using XP and did not have to download any add'l drivers or updates as an earlier review had mentioned.  Perhaps they have updated the included software.  Installation was a breeze.<br />Battery life seems to last quite a while after the first initial use and recharge, even with LCD on.  Comes with two batteries & charger.  I bought four more though so battery life isn't a problem.  I also bought a SmartMedia card reader but I actually took this back.  I found that the supplied USB cable works fine.  Downloads are fast and really don't seem to put any add'l strain on the batteries.<br />I have yet to use the movie mode so I can't comment on this.  I didn't purchase the camera for this however.<br />The menu on the LCD is quite easily navigated for any setting changes, picture deletions, etc.<br />Why only 4 out of 5 stars?  Flash.  As others have mentioned it is quite brite and does sometimes change flesh tones in auto mode.  I have found this to be more of a problem the closer you are to your subject though.  Majority of the time the flash actually helps in an indoor environment.<br />In closing I'll say this.  I had also been considering a higher end camera for around $[money].  I found this camera to have many of the same features + a 16MB card included rather than an 8MB.  Initially I was a bit hesitant to purchase this camera due to the lower cost.  After about two weeks of use I can say I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend it.  A great camera for beginners diving into the digital world or even an upgrade from a lower end camera.","I've had this camera for about two months now and I must say that I am very pleased with it. It takes wonderful pictures. I compared it with friends who have more expensive digital cameras with more mega pixels and the FinePix 2600 measures up. The day pictures are excellent with this camera, the nighttime pictures could be better but that's not a problem since I take few of those anyway. Overall this is a very good camera for a reasonable price.","Simply, the Fuji lens gives you fine crisp photos for the average photographer.  A good all around camera for taking family photos, simple to use with not a lot of controls to fuss with, the auto exposure and auto focus functions are more than capable of taking great pictures.  If you are going to take a lot of indoor or outdoor flash photos at distances more than 9 feet, I recommend the Sunpak Digital Flash Kit[...] It will dramatically increase the flash range of the camera.  Also don't bother downloading pictures from the camera, takes too long and eats up the batteries.  Again, [...]get a SanDisc Smart Memory Reader.  You will be able to down load your pictures in under a minute!  All in all a great little camera for casual use.","After years of thinking about it, I finally did it: I bought myself a digital camera. No more film, no more developing expenses, no more waiting! I did my homework and looked at many different types, but every element in my decision led back to the Fuji FinePix 2600. First of all, I was determined to stay below the $[money]range. Then, I wanted a camera that could take good pictures, was easy to manipulate, and made photo downloads an easy task. This one had all of it.<br />The negative elements: the lens cover/power button combination can be a little counterintuitive at times (nothing too bad, but it can become a pain in the neck); the SmartMedia card it comes with (16 MB) falls short, if you want to stay in the 1-2MP range. If you're willing to sacrifice resolution, or willing to empty it every 40-50 pictures, then you're well off; the LCD can use a little more brightness while you view it outdoors; and finally and most critical in my opinion, it misses a charger with a WIRE to connect it to the camera. The one it comes with forces you to take the batteries out to charge them. Otherwise, it's an awesome little camera for the price.","I did alot of research and finally decided on the Fuji Finepix 2600.  I never thought that I'd have a need/want for a digital camera.  Just didn't think the cost was justified.  But I decided to treat myself and buy this camera.  This camera is simple to use, takes excellent pictures, and I mean excellent.  I'm glad I didn't spend more money and get a higher MP quality.  This one does a great job.  The prints with my Old Canon BJC-6000 are quite good.  The included software shows your pictures in a great Slide show.  Everything about this camera and software are simple to use.","I first bought a Canon PowerShot S200 and returned it bucause of the poor picture quality (I have a review for it too). I then bought the Fuji FinePix 2600. The major factors I considered is the ISO 100 rating, the 1600x1200 resolution, and the low price. After taking more than one hundred pictures under different conditions(indoor, outdoor, low light), I am very satisfied with the camera. The pictures are very well focused and very sharp. The colors are very real and vivid. The noise of the picture is very low. It is really hard to find a bad picture. I can hardly believe it that the picture quality can be so good. I was a little reluctant at the beginning to buy this camera because of its little bit bigger size. Now with such good picture quality the size is not a problem at all.","I bought this camera one week ago and after taking about 400 shots with it, I decided I'd share my thoughts on this very nice camera.<br />First, the quality of the shots is very good for a 2 megapixel camera. Using the 2M-N quality configuration (that's two megapixels with normal resolution), I get very nice 1600 X 1200 pictures that are just the right size for printing on 8½ X 11 photo paper. The colors are usually good in automatic configuration, though I had to adjust the White Balance when shooting indoor with neon light to prevent the skin tones from looking greenish. Plus the shots are about 300-350k each and I can store 153 shots on my 64Mb SmartMedia card.<br />The flash is decent for such a small camera and the red-eye reduction works most of the time, but not if the subject is not looking straight at the camera. You can also take pictures without flash (if it's dark and the object you're shooting is too far for the flash to be effective for example), but I've had lots of problems doing so. Since there is no manual shutter speed setting, you have to rely on the camera for adjsting its speed. This results in very blurry images since it is impossible to stop your hands from shaking for a whole 2 seconds while the shot is being taken. So use a tripod (which I don't have) for pictures without flash.<br />The LCD screen is pretty good, but when you use it indoor or in dark conditions it is hard to see what your shot will look like. The brightness setting will just make things look awful. The viewfinder is a good replacement, but the fact that the LCD screen is raised on the back of the camera results in your nose touching the screen when you take a picture which is annoying since you have to clean it all the time.<br />The movie mode (without sound) is a nice addition, but the 3Mb / 10 frames/second avi files are far from perfect. I prefer to use it only for a nice 360 degrees view of the surrondings.<br />Battery life is good, I took 179 shots with the viewfinder plus the LCD to check if my pictures were OK before the batteries died.<br />As for the software bundled with the camera, I haven't tried it out, since I just have to take the SmartMedia card right into my Toshiba Laptop to view my pictures.<br />I would recommend this camera to any amateur photograph (like me!) who is on a budget, wants a camera with excellent picture quality and dosen't plan to do lots of night or very dark shots.<br />An easy 4 out of 5 stars.","I just got this camera a week ago.  The quality of the picture is great and it has some of nice features including red eye reduction and flash controls.  Even with the settings on automatic, it took some really nice pictures.  But the plastic exterior is so fragile.  It's been a week and I have scratches all over the place - and I only really used it once! I regret that I didn't spend a little more money and bought a well built (non-plastic) camera with the similar functions and quality. It's a good camera but if you're one of those people that brake things easily - I would definately not recommend this camera.","I got this camera for my birthday and have found that is has the best color of any digital camera I have bought.  It is great!<br />I have ordered prints from it and they turned out even better.<br />It has a 20 second movie on it that comes out awesome.<br />I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a camera.","This little camera was a very wise purchase. .... I used it for the first time today and the photos are clear and bright. Again I say....a very wise purchase decision.","What I like:<br />*Fits in pocket<br />*Intuitive to use<br />*Fast battery refresh rate<br />*Easy to download photos to PC<br />*Red eye reduction better than most<br />*Optics good for price range<br />What I don't like:<br />*Battery cover opens too easily while taking photos; batteries easily fall out<br />*128MB card is the largest the camera can handle<br />*Silent video a drawback<br />*LCD monitor hard to see in sun light, but viewfinder is clear<br />*On/off switch and open lens cover to take picture is a nuisance<br />*Software is good for downloading, but poor for editing photos<br />Overall assessment:<br />I love the camera overall, especially the picture quality.  Batteries wanting to fall out occasionally gets very frustrating.  Be sure to buy the AC power adapter for downloading pictures to the computer to save on the batteries.","I've had this camera for less than a week, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The 16 MB card probably won't be enough, so I also purchased a 64 MB card.  I take photos at 1280x960 (the middle resoultion option) at the lower of two compressions, and image quality is excellent.  At this size, the 64 MB card holds 100 pictures.  The optical zoom is very good.  I've used the 20 second movie clip feature a few times.  In low light situations, the image quality of the clips are kind of poor, but I didn't buy the camera for this feature, so I'm not really concerned.  The fact that you have to open the lense cover *and* turn on the camera to use it is a little tedious, but I grew accustomed to it after a few uses.  The Macro function allows you to take close up pictures of smaller objects and delivers excellent detail.  There are several flash options, including No Flash, Red Eye Reduction, Auto, and Timer.  I'm very satisfied with this camera and recommend it.","I purchased the FinePix 2600 and received it about 1 week ago.  I read a ton of different reviews of similar cameras in this price range and can say without a doubt that I made the right choice.  The picture quality is fantastic.<br />This camera comes packed with everything you need to start taking great pictures right out of the box.  It comes with the 16MB Smart Media card, which holds about 30 pictures at normal resolution or about 15 at the highest setting.  Plenty for starting out, but would recommend getting a 64/128 MB card for big trips sometime down the road.  It also comes with the rechargable batteries and charger and those work well also.  I would also recommend getting a 2nd set of the batteries for longer outings also.<br />This is a great point and shoot camera, with a few manual features for the more advanced user.  For me, the default settings work just fine.<br />This camera is very easy to use and to unload the pictures to your PC.  I think this camera has something for everyone, from novice to more advanced users.<br />I don't think I've ever written a review of a product before, but I had to repay the favor of those whose reviews helped my decision.  Thanks!","Bought this little camera for Christmas gift for girlfriend.  Its perfect, we both love it. And take it everywhere.  I also got a 128 Meg memory card. It will hold several hundred pictures at lower resolution or about 100 at high res. (we keep it at high resolution). Very happy with 8x10 prints. And all web or PC viewing of photos is very good.  This is not a top end camera, but for point and shoot, great results! I highly recommend this camera.  The software that comes with it is also quite good, I ran it under windows 98 and now windows XP, with no problems, and the batch save and batch resize options are great for bringing 2meg pix down to 50k jpeg's for uploading to the web server.  Enjoy. - Bob","I delayed purchasing a digital camera for many months due to my fear of buying the wrong one.  This one has been a true joy!  The 16MB Smartmedia card and the battery charger are nice extras.  The menu takes a little practice, but you get used to it.  For an inexpensive point and shoot, it has many extra features.","This is my first digital camera and I am quite pleased with the results thus far.  The camera is very easy to use and takes great pictures.  The only complaint that I have about the camera is the lens cover.  The cover needs to be fully \"clicked\" open in order to take a picture and it is very easily \"unclicked\".  This requires you to slide the cover open again...a little annoying but tolerable.","This is an excellent digital camera.  Simple to use.  Exceptional picture quality.<br />A few minor caveats: Two step on/off is a pain.  Battery compartment wants to open during certain functions.<br />Bottom line: Light, easy, great results!","I'm a novice with digital cameras, but found this one very easy to use.  I didn't even have to read the manual to find out how to set everything, just played around a little and found everything.  It is very easy to download the photos to your computer and they download very fast.  Just plug it in and there they are.  The free software isn't that good, I'd recommend buying different software for playing with the pictures.  The batteries died pretty quickly the first time I used them, but after their second charge, they seem to be lasting a long time and I always have the display on.  My only complaint about the camera is how bright the flast makes things.  The images have a whiteness about them when taken with the flash.  It isn't unbearable, just minor, but it still could be better.  Overall though this camera is easy to use, works fast and takes very nice pictures.","Wow! This camera is awesome. I just got it yesterday. I love it. Great picture quality, great zoom, great camera. There is a little bit of a delay between the time you press the shutter and when it actually takes the picture, but it's not bad. The movie mode is pretty cool. It might cost more than the beginner wants to pay, but it's worth it.. If you're a beginner, go get this camera. I didn't even read the manual, and within minutes I was taking pictures.<br />Oh, by the way, you might want to get another set of NiMH batteries and a charger, because you sure don't want to use alkaline, eats them like they're nothing.","In all of the reviews of this digital camera, no one has mentioned the fact that this camera will double as a webcam.  Being on a ship, I have emailed some video clips with the movie mode to my wife and she thought they were good quality as well.  I bought this camera in a shady electronics store in Singapore and although got ripped off on the price, here on Amazon you are getting a deal.  I recommend purchasing a larger smartmedia card, but all the reviews of good battery life and excellent photos are true.  I would also like to say that my camera seems to be durable, I have had it training in the field and it still works well... This is truly a great point and shoot camera.","This camera seems to be a good balance of features, size, & most importantly money spent. It gets the job done! It comes with rechargeable batties & a charger. The didgital zoom is useless for me but I like the optical zoom at 3x. I could have spent more money but why? This thing is just perfect for me.... But right now I'm happy. I use the macro mode a lot for tanking pictures of my aquarium. I love NOT having to go to get my photos developed (does anybody really print photos anymore?). With 35mm film it always seemed that half the pictures I got develpoed either came out bad or there was something else wrong with them. Now if I take a bad photo you know right away (from the display screen) - You just erase & take it again.<br />  Just remember you can always print the good ones.<br />...<br />  Steve","My wife and I read lots of reviews and talked with several people before buying our camera. We discovered that the biggest problem with digital cameras besides the fact that they all eat alkaline batteries is educating yourself before you buy so you don't get one that you'll regret later. If you are like my wife and I you don't want to do a lot of thinking or reading to get going with taking pictures once you buy. This camera took all of a minute to master the functions and we did that in the store before buying it. It is as simple as pointing and clicking. I am amazed at how good the pictures come out everytime. The 16 mb smart media card that comes with it has proven to be plenty of storage space for us. I upload to the computer every 20 shots and thats a lot of pictures for us. ( We've never been big picture takers til now) For the money this is a best buy. You'll need to call Fuji for the AC adapter because we found out that its hard to find. Like us, you'll notice you put nose prints on the display screen but all that we looked at had this same problem. My HP 1115 photosmart printer and this 2600Zoom Finepix get along great and the quality of the prints are excellent. I haven't had any problmes with the camera matching up to windows 98se on my computer. The camera has a quality feel to it and its small enough that it fits in my wifes purse easily. You won't regret this camera if you purchase it. Its great. The first charge got us over 275 Pictures before needing recharged. You'll want to get an extra set of batteries so you won't have to wait the five hours or so to recharge and you'll have to buy a case, but other than these things and the A/C adapter the camera is pretty much complete with all you'll need. Storing pictures to a floppy is a breeze and to a CD is slightly harder but it can also be done easily. The resolution of the 20 second video mode is a bit disappointing but I found this to be true with all of the digital cameras. I'd truthfully give this Fuji 2600Zoom Finepix camera a 6 star rating if I could, and 10 stars for ease of use. Its awesome through and through. Fuji has a real winner here.","I love this camera.  This is my first digital, I've been taking \"old fasioned\" pictures for quite awhile.  I have a Canon A2E and about $1500 in lenses.<br />This little digital is really handy.  It's wonderful for taking pictures of our newborn and posting them immediately to the web, which is a big deal to the grandparents.  It's nice to just click away and not worry about the cost (film+processing=alot).<br />Weaknesses would be a weak flash, past 10ft is pointless.  And, what seems like a slow write time, (maybe its all digitals though) sometimes takes 3 or 4 seconds before you can take another picture.  I really like my Canon(film) for taking up to 10 shots per second.<br />Strengths would be it takes really good pictures.  The Macro feature is awesome.  Great for taking close-up face pictures of the baby.  The included software is great for picture organization, poor for editing, but I have photoshop for that.  The optical zoom is also handy, sometimes \"moving your feet\" ruins the shot.  Battery life seems good, but we have 2 spare batteries, almost all pictures are taken indoors, and we carry the charger everywhere, so swapping batteries is no big deal.<br />Tips.  Use the viewscreen when using Macro, the eyepiece is deceptive for closeups.  Use the highest quality setting always, can always reduce picture size for the web or email.<br />Very happy with the camera and quality.  Perfect for family gatherings and babys.","...this is a really nice camera for the money. It's fairly easy to use. The only problem I had was that you need to open the lens cover ALL the way or you will get an error message (\"lens cover\").<br /><br /> The camera is menu driven which makes it very easy to get up and running. It's a very user friendly camera. I was taking pictures within about 5 minutes and downloaded my first batch.<br /><br /> The features are impressive for this price range. This camera can do quite a lot (stills, short movies, and be a webcam). The basic picture quality (1M) is fantastic. The quality is FAR better than scanning a regular photograph if you intend on using this for the internet. In fact, the photographic quality is far superior to some 35mm cameras (e.g. my olympus infinity), but nowhere near as good as a medium format camera.<br /><br />The memory isn't very large and I would agree with the suggestions about getting a viking memory card. The larger Viking memory cards will allow you to save around 166 pictures in high quality mode. You can see your photos immediately after, which means deleting any goof ups.<br /><br /> The batteries that come with the camera need charging, but will allow you to take a few pics. The AC adapter for this camera is a necessity since you can use it as a webcamera. You will also attach this camera to your computer if only to download pictures.<br /><br /> I am really happy with this purchase a couple of months after my initial version of this review: especially after seeeing what I could have bought in this price range. I may never buy another cheap point and press film camera after this.","I've tried four other digitals and like this one the best. For the money the Fugi FinePix line is great. Had the A101 first, and loved the quality, but needed the zoom feature of the 2600, as I hate to be intrusive when I go for the close-ups! Please, please, please note to first time digital buyers. Do not expect the battery life to equal that of a regular 35mm! Buy rechargible batteries ... and use the optical view finder, (it's larger than most). The LCD screen drains the life of the batteries, and when used to review your pictures will do the job intended, and save those batteries. Also buy an extra 32 or larger smart media card. Doing these two things will provide the extra life and power to produce great pictures. This camera produces great pictures, is light weight, and easy to use. And unlike some more expensive mini models, the \"lag\" time after you push the button isn't even noticable. This is my personal choice. I keep family records and scrapbooks, take tons of pictures and this is the camera for me.","I never was one for taking pictures (except of my grandkids) but being a techie, I decided to get a digital camera. After reading all the reviews, I decided on the Fuji 2600. It is great. It takes beautiful pictures, and I love the fact that I can take pictures, view them instantly and then upload them onto the computer and send them out to my friends and family. I did buy a SmartMedia card reader so I am not constantly using the batteries. This makes it very easy to get the pictures on the computer. Pictures are sharp and clear, and actually the batteries seem to last quite a while before recharging. I'm not familiar with all the manual settings yet, but the automatic setting works for me. I couldn't ask for better pictures. I definitely recommend this camera!","This is an excellent camera, and it's quite versatile: can be used both as a digital camera and a web cam.  The only (minor) two complains I have is: the shape of the camera; it's harder to hold than the old Fuji 1400, which is a 1.4MP camera I also have.  The lens cover needs an extra push to get it in place to take a picture.  Have said that, the camera image is wonderful outdoors, and the LCD is big and beatiful.  I think it's very competitve comparing to lots of more expensive cameras for family style photos.","I would recomend this camera to any one the pictures are great and its easy to use. The only thing I found to be a problem for me was the shutter the camera is small and I kept moving the shutter with my hand witch made the camera not take pictures. but a little adjustment and I had no problem.All I can say is a great cmera for the price","While I think the FinePix 2600 is a very nice camera for beginners, having used other cameras there are a few gotchas in my opinion.  The LCD screen is quite dark even in regular room lighting.  The optical viewfinder is a lifesaver here.  I have also found that the white balance in shots taken under florescent lights can be less than perfect.  It also bothers me you can't view photos on the LCD unless the lens cover is open.<br />The pictures are good,  but I found I was tweaking every one by adjusting the brightness and contrast. My previous camera (Olympus D-360L) never required this.  OK, I am picky. I admit it. In addition, using the zoom allows you to be further from your subject- but remember the flash may not be able to cover that distance.  This isn't specific to the 2600- but keep it in mind.  Based on the average review I've seen here, this is one HOT camera.  I don't want to dampen things, but if you are expecting a bit more from this camera, like I was, you MIGHT be disappointed.<br />I would suggest you also check out the Olympus D-510z camera, also available from Amazon.","I got this camera early December and have used it throughout the holiday season.  It's my first digital camera and I absolutely love it.<br />The quality of the pictures are very good (my friend using a more expensive Canon camera took same picture as I and mine was significantly clearer; I don't know if it was because of different settings, however).  The LCD display is decent and the controls are very intuitive.  There is also a 10-sec timer mode and a macro mode for close-up pictures.  The included charger works very well (takes about 5 hours for a full charge) and the two included Ni-MH batteries are 1700 mAh, which last fairly long.  One word of precaution though: the first one or two times you use the camera, the batteries will seem to run out very quickly.  This is supposedly due to the \"memory effect\" and the problem is gone after a few full charges.  It also happens if you charge you batteries before they're fully discharged (however, unlike the old Ni-Cad rechargeables, Ni-MH's are not physically harmed--they just seem to run out faster.  After a few full discharges and recharges, they work fine again).  I got 4 backup 1600 mAh recently at an electronics store and now I can go to a trip without worrying about running out while I'm outside (just fyi, the included charger holds two batteries max and is compatible with all voltages, which means you only have to find the proper outlet \"shape\" adapter if you travel outside of the country)<br />With a 64MB card that I got with the Fujifilm rebate (I believe the promotion is over now) I'm able to take 150+ images at the 2M, Normal resolution.  But the provided 16 MB card is quite decent for starters, especially if you use a lower resolution.<br />The optical zoom (which makes the camera totally worth its cost) works really well and the lens are really quiet.<br />The movie function (limited to 20 second intervals with no sound)is quite good.  They are converted to .avi format during upload on a Windows machine (I'm not sure about Mac's though).  However, you cannot use optical zoom while taking movies and there's no flash, which brings us to the major gripe about this product...<br />The flash is exceeding white, which can change the tones of the pictures (making the colors less vibrant, in my opinion).  However, the problem is if you turn the flash off, you must not move your hands *at all* or else the pictures become really blurry.  However, if you use a tripod or put the camera on a steady surface (e.g. table) when you take the picture, it comes out just fine and the colors are really nice.  But usually I'd rather just leave the flash on and have slightly \"whiter\" colors.  This is stated in the camera's included manual.  However, when the environment has enough lighting, if you or the camera's auto-flash mode chooses not to use flash, the pictures come out really nicely, which leads to the conclusion that the camera needs enough light (either from the flash or enough external lighting) to produce clear pictures, or else you'd have to have really steady hands.  One of the reviewers before me mentioned the camera's inability to take pictures with slight movement.  I believe his problem was the one I mentioned.  He probably decided to turn the flash off or something along those lines and so consequently got blurry pictures.<br />The other problem with this camera is that it collects dust and dirt really easily.  Therefore, you should find a case for it ASAP (as I did for mine).  Just one day after I got it, I discovered a scratch/stain-like spot on the lens, which fortunately has not affected the pictures but is still quite frustrating.  Just today I found a small piece of dust collected inside the peek-through viewfinder, which also fortunately does not affect the functioning of the camera.  All in all, I did months of research before finally buying this camera (it came down to this or the Kodak 3600, and I'm happy about my choice--however, Amazon can be a little sketchy in terms of...)<br />In summary,<br />pros<br />-- good picture quality<br />-- good LCD display<br />-- intuitive controls<br />-- included quality rechargeable batteries and charger<br />-- good optical zoom<br />-- movie function<br />-- \"bang for da buck\"<br />cons<br />-- flash too bright; alters colors<br />-- pictures in dark areas get blurry without flash unless a tripod or other steady surface is used to hold the camera<br />-- collects dusts, dirt, grease really easily","This is the most compact design camera with high quality photo shots. I love it. Great for any use, nice day and night shots and also takes 20sec clips. Recomend as a first camera for starters or someone who wants to upgrade.","I tried a Sony Mavika first and it seemed awfully cumbersome to have to page around and also to set one of six picture qualities whereas the Fujifilm 2600 was easy, especially right out of the box.  The one setting fits most was very comforting when shooting different scenes.<br />Also interesting to learn so much about the digital cameras from the Staples store personel.  They are very knowledgeable and friendly.  Their 110% price matching guarantee also is attractive when shopping for items in this price range.","I have owned this camera for about a month now and love everything about it.  Tried two others including the Finepix 2400 and decided to keep this one.  Wanted a point and shoot that I could print up to 8 x 10's with and this camera does just that.  Very easy to use and setup. Find the rechargable batteries lasting a long time compared with the alkaline (they must be used and recharged to get full benefit). Color is very true to life.  Not finding much motion blur at all which was a problem with the 2400. I did buy Adobe's Photoshop Elements program to go with the camera.  Printed a great 8 x 10 of my son at the piano during his recital before Christmas and relatives thought it was professionally done.  Have a good photo printer which helps. Macro mode works great. Movie mode works fine but I would never use this as I have a good camcorder. Great entry level digital camera especially for the price!","This camera is very simple to use, factoring in all the features available. You can go from point and shoot to more complex shots. The only dissappointments are the life of the rechargable batteries, and the fact no 3V adaptor is included. Also, providing a case for it would have been nice. Overall it is a great little camera that does not require photography classes to produce great shots. I did not experience any difficulty uploading photos to my PC, the directions were clear and simple.","...I have made beautiful 8x10 prints both inkjet and dye sublimation from this little camera and most people cant tell the difference between it and my Nikon. Much faster than other cameras in the same price range and cheaper memory cards.","I just read a pretty scathing review in the photography trade magazine site.  If you are expecting 35mm SLR performance from this camera, you will be disappointed.  But if you want something that will take good \"snap-shots\" and are willing to keep the flash distance within about 10 feet, you will be rewarded with a very easy to use camera.  I added a 64 meg smart media card and can get 100 pictures at the 1280x960 setting with resolution set to fine.  Not too damn bad.<br />Glad I purchased it and have been very pleased with the expected results.<br />Would have given it five stars if the flash was a little more powerful.  Had to learn the hard way.","I have had this camera for almost a week now, and am very pleased with it. The size is nice, the controls are intuitive, and the picture quality is quite good. The price-to-feature ratio is excellent. As anyone who has done some comparative shopping will know, it is very easy to spend a lot more than [amt] on a digital camera which may either do more than you need or be difficult to learn to use. This is a more than acceptable entry-level digital camera which should satisfy the vast majority of us who are point-and-shoot users.<br />Having said this, there are two points buyers should be aware of:<br />1. If you are running Windows XP, the software included with the camera will not work, and you will need to download a new program from fujifilm.com. The size of the update is large (>10 MB), so if you use anything other than broadband be prepared for an all-night download session.<br />2. First-time digit camera buyers should be aware that there are a lot of hidden costs involved in making the jump from film to pixels. Aside from the purchase price of the camera, be prepared to buy a larger memory card for the camera (this model includes a 16 MB card which is better than what you usually get but not as big as you need), extra rechargeable batteries and a charger, a photo-quality printer, and photo paper for printing your pictures. All said, the \"total\" cost of this camera with everything you need will be about [price].","I bought the Fuji 2600 for my family to use, including my kids. We truly had a wonderful time with it over the holidays. There is nothing like telling your 7-year old's, \"Go take some pictures!\" This camera is that easy to use. The images it produces are great and the flash works wonderfully. The colors are very nice, and the viewing software for the PC is very simple to use. Fuji even provided 1700 mAh batteries (which are state-of-the-art). Make sure that you get something close to that, and get several sets. The only dissapointments are that only compressed images are available, and that there is no lens filter to protect the lens from kids fingers and accidents while shooting pictures. I also recommend getting a 64MB or a 128MB smartcard, with which you'll be able to take 150 or 300 pictures (amazing!).","I bought the Fuji 2600 for my family to use, including my kids.

You don't have to have a degree in computer science to do the connections and view the image.  It is a quick 1,2,3 sequence--point, shoot, plug in.<br />The finished product is a clear, bright picture without the fuzzy edges of many digital cameras.  The quality is actually surprising for the convenience it affords.<br />Thank you Fuji for a fine product.","I am very impressed with this unit. It is VERY easy to use and is packed with features. Uses the very inexpensive SmartMeadia memory (picked up a 128 MB) and comes with rechargeable batterys. CAN'T BEAT THIS DEAL!!! The image quality is OUTSTANDING!","I'm an experienced amateur photographer who's stayed away from the digital craze.  I'm not a technophobe, just didn't like the way these things were becoming obsolete so quickly.  With the family spreading out geographically and everyone being online, it was time to take the plunge.  As advertised, this camera was easy to get up and going with and the images are stunning.  The price, quality of the photos and it's features make this a great value for anyone wanting to get their feet wet in digital photography.","My girlfriend wanted to buy me a digital camera for xmas, so I looked around on the internet for a couple days to try and find the best camera for 300 dollars.  After reading alot of reviews I decided that the fuji finepix 2600 was for me.  Yesterday I opened it, and took it out of the box.  I started charging the batteries, (the battery charger and batteries is a key reason why I bought the camera) and to just play with it, I threw 2 regular batteries into the camera...  within 5 minutes I had pretty much mastered the controls and figured out all the flash settings and movie settings, without even looking at the manual.  The regular batteries died in about 5 minutes though.  After the rechargables were charged, I put them in and I played with the camera all day.  I must have taken over 200 shots yesterday (deleting alot, and transfering to computer) and the rechargables didnt die until about 11pm last night!  The pictures are VERY VERY VERY clear, and sharp.  I was able to hold about 45 pictures in the default settings, and Im off to the store now for a 128 meg card!  This camera is my first digital camera and I am so pleased with it.  The picture quality is amazing.<br />The only thing that I might now like about it is, that the video mode is restricted to 20 second, no matter how large your smartmedia card is.  And also that the LCD screen is useless in a dark atmosphere.  It isnt that big of a deal, in the dark you just put the flash on so it flashes twice, and it looks like the room is in the daylight.","This is a great camera.  It takes great pictures, has a lot of good features, and is easy to use right out of the box.  Love that it only requires 2 batteries, and the camera comes with 2 rechargeable batteries, which are also easy to supplement with new ones from Radio Shack, and I have already purchased extras.<br />Very easy to download pictures from camera to computer.  I've seen this process with other cameras, usually very involved and complicated.  With this camera, just plug it in, and turn it on.  All pictures are automatically downloaded by doing that, and you can either \"save all\" or save just the ones you want.  Then if you have some decent imaging software, you can do what you need to do with the pictures, whether it be cropping or lightening them up.<br />Because this camera is so easy, my friends are envious and are looking at getting the same camera.<br />The only complaint I would have is that the power left in the batteries isn't displayed until the batteries are low, which could be too late if you don't have extras.  I am the kind of person that likes to know the status of things (even batteries), even if they are fully charged.  Don't wait until they are low before you tell me, because then it could be too late.  The way I have gotten over this is to have several pairs of rechargeable batteries.<br />All in all, a great camera, and a great bargain!","I'm happy with my purchase. I would recommend it for it's wonderful image quality and ease of use. I know those who read these reviews like to hear the downsides, so I'll say them, but realize that they are puny in comparison.<br />It works as a WebCam as well, but the resulting video is WAY to dark. I have 2 100Watt lights shining directly on me from 2 feet away and it's finally bright enough. Don't expect to use it heavily for webcamming.<br />Like most digital cameras, it's flash is VERY white. What I mean by that is that the resulting pictures are not very colorful because the flash has to be so bright. This is probably because of the same reason the webcam is dim: The component that receives the light and converts it to a digital image requires a LOT of light to make a good image. The camera has a cool feature that allows you to increase the exposure time. This is great for absolutely still shots, but, of course not good for action shots.<br />That's about it. I'd recommend it!","I bought this camera a couple of months ago, and I think it is great!  It is very easy to use, I was proficient at it the day I bought it.  It is very simple to transfer photos, all you do is plug it in, turn it on, and the pictures appear on the computer.  Also, the battery life is long.  I like it a lot and would reccomend it to all.","I bought my Fuji FinePix 2600 Zoom Digital Camera from Amazon a week ago and got it on Wednesday.  I have never used a camera until I bought this one.  I love it!  I have had sooo much fun using the camera.  I bought additional memory cards, (64 and 16 mb).  I am considering a 128 mb card!  I think that this camera is great for beginners since it is easy to use.  The camera takes very nice pictures.  Some of the images from other cameras are not so great.","This Camera is absolutly wonderful! I am a sophmore in HS, and it so was so easy for me to learn, after reading the instrutions and a little bit of trial and error, It was so fun! The pic. quality is awesome! There hasn't been one day gone by since i got that i haven't used it. One suggestion is you might need to buy extra batteries. Its nice not having to wait 5 hrs. until you can use it agian. Overall Great Camera, would recomend it to anyone!","With out a doubt the best camera value for the money  I have found to date. We have more expensive  cameras  in our office the Canon A-20  and the Sony Cybershot P40 and they did not come close to the sharp clear picture that this unit takes. Very clear and understandable controls , easy USB Mac or PC connection.  I do not hesitate to recommends this camera very nice !!  one last thing buy at least 4 more rechargable batteries it only comes with two","The FujiFine Pix Is An Excellent Digital Camera! The Color And Quality Of Photos Is Awesome...Even In Low Light! I Highly Recommend This Camera! A++++","It's my first digital camera, but I'm a Graphic Designer so am used to working with digital images.  The picture resolution is great, and the camera itself is small and easy to use.  The software is also easy -- I tend to use more advanced graphic programs, but for downloading to my PC, the image software works fine.  I like the camera display screen - it has a good picture and the zoom feature is fun.  Still have a lot more to go over with the camera's other uses, but really like it so far.","I just got this camera today after it was recommended by a friend.  I'm amazed!  I've never really worked a digital camera before so I was worried I'd spend hours figuring it out.  But it was pretty easy to figure out.  I just started pushing buttons to see what happened and I figured it out that way.  You have a display button which turns on the lcd display.  There is also a menu button and that brings up the menu where you can navigate your way around to set the flash mode, self timer etc.  If you are looking for a camera to take pictures of the family, this is a wonderful choice.  My pictures are all very sharp and clear.  For XP users:  I am using XP and all I had to do was install the normal software on the enclosed CD and then download the XP update from their website (...) before hooking up the camera to my computer.  I've taken a ton of pictures today and haven't had any trouble using Windows XP with this camera.  Compare this camera to other cameras in the same price range.  You will see what a great value you are getting in the finepix 2600.  I was pleased to see that this camera had a 16 MB smartmedia card (a lot come with only 8 MB).  It also comes with a charger and rechargeable batteries.  This camera does not come with a case so you may want to consider purchasing one separately.  The FinePix 2600 is a lot of bang for the buck.  I couldn't be happier with my camera.","turns out that it is a very good product. Some digital camera's LCD panel is not real time, you can see the time lag... but not this one.<br />With the 35 dollars rebate, it is the best possible price for a 2M pixel camera with 3x optical zoom. And it is made in Japan, not some other countries in which I don't really trust the workmanship.","I don't know much about pixels and images etc. but I do know the pictures turn out great.  I liked the price first and when I got the camera I liked the quality especially how the lens is covered.  I definitely have to use the strap because I dropped it once (on carpeting, thank goodness) but it was not damaged in any way.  My grandson likes the video option but I haven't used it.  Since I'm an old granny, it took me a while to figure out how to download the pictures with the USB thing.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.","I am not a person who knows much about electronics, and especially digital cameras,but the 2600 by fuji was very simple to learn, after messing around with  it for just a couple hours, I was a pro at the thing, I would have to say that this camera was definatly an A+ investment","This camera is a very practical camera for the majority of us who just want to record the highlights of our lives.<br />Simple to buy, set up, and use<br />Well equipped with charger and 16 meg memory<br />Excellent picture quality - good optics AND digital resolution<br />Good value (...)ready to roll...","This is a very good camera for its price range and features including true 3X optical zoom lens which retracts very neatly when you shut the camera off. The two step camera shut off (which amazom review sees as a weak point) is actually very useful for viewing pics and keeps the lens shut. So you can see pics in bad weather without worring about your lens.<br />The digital zoom doesn't work with the 2 megapixel resolution, it only works with 1 megapixel or VGA mode. However the digital zoom could be done later on the computer also, so no big problems.<br />The battery charger included is supposed to recharge a fully discharged battery in 5 hrs. The manual refer to any fuji charger for times under 2 hrs.<br />The kit includes excellent accessories: 2 AA 1700mAh NiMH rechargable batteries, recharger (works from 110-240 V), 16MB smartmedia card with cover/label, a hand strap (handy when shooting or otherwise, increases the grip), a USB cable for getting pics on your PC, a CD with software including the finepix viewer, owner's manual and a software manual.<br />Never even needed to go through the software manual while installing the softwares on a Windows 2000 machine. The software to transfer images looks good. The software CD includes 3/4 other softwares which I haven't used till now. One is the movie player for recorded movies (the .avi movies don't play on windows media player). The manuals are easy to read and understand. There's no TV output like Canon Elph and other expensive ones. The movies recorded are not so great but then this isn't a camcorder !<br />Other features include a low battery warning, date/time setting, image size/compression ratio setting, flash mode/white balance settings, camera shake warning and macro setting. The flash setting does come to a good use at many times.<br />One downfall is that the max 1/2 sec shutter time means that night pictures on streets are not good. In case you want to do lots of night photography, nikon coolpix 775 or canon digital elph s110 or s300 are better options. But remember that others come with proprietary batteries which may become unavailable or cost a lot.<br />The other disadvantage in my opinion is the smartmedia card, since most things are swichting over to compact flash. However the fuji rebate solves this problem for now ! As far as the design goes it very good. Yoiu might feel that the camera is slightly thicker given its width/height. The battery/smartmedia card both go in the same compartment and the door to it looks sligthly cheap.<br />The playback mode for movies/pics is very good. You can zoom in and out of pics and erase one/all pics. The software menu on the camera seems pretty good and intelligent.<br />Another recommendation is to buy a big smartemedia card (max that can be used is 128MB). This will make your camera more useful. Finally the manual claims 150-300 frames with one pair of fully charged batteries depending on LCD usage. In case rechartgable batteries run out, you can use normal AA ones. Carrying one or two more pairs of batteries will be great and solves the problem of LCD eating the batteries (you can't do this with camera's that have proprietary ones). After all NiMH AA batteries are so inexpensive !<br />A Fuji kit for 2600 is also available which includes a cmaera case, lens cleaning kit, tripod, 4 NiMH batteries and one more recharger.","I've taken literally about 1000 shots since I bought the camera 1 month ago.  Yes, everyone loves this camera, but it is not perfect.  The LCD cannot be seen well in bright daylight conditions, so I use the view finder and everything is fine.  That's it.  No big deal for such a small, reliable camera that takes great pics.<br />Cool things I especially like:<br />-Included software is VERY helpful at managing lots of photos through helpful automatic pic re-naming and storage options.<br />-Macro mode makes close-ups and EXTREME close-ups (to 10cms!) very crisp, clear and in-focus.<br />-Free Fujifilm.net service is integrated into software allowing you to post !100MBs! of pics online at no charge for up to 30 days for viewing by friends, family, etc., making print orders a snap.<br />Recommendations:<br />-Track down the ($) rebate for combined purchase of Camera and SmartMedia card or digital photo processing.<br />-Get a big SmartMedia card to get up to 166 top res shots onto a 128MB card.","I don't why there's no talk of rebate on this website but there's a rebate from fuji available for this if you buy the smartmedia card & this camera together from the same place & at same time.<br />Great quality of pictures and the best part is the rechargable AA batteries (only 2 not 4 !). AA batteries means u save a lot on batteries and don't have to pay the manufacturer for proprietary batteries. Only the camera is out of production and a better battery technology comes in, the properitary old batteries can be very difficult and costly to find... like carrying a PC with no power supply :)<br />The only bad part is that its slightly thick in size and takes only 128 MB cards at the max. It won't read a bigger card once they become available. But 128MB must be enough for most cases ! Or heck buy 2 of them !!<br />Also the low light pictures are not so great. Look for nikon 775 in case u want good night pictures as well. And it has no TV out.<br />The image quality is excellent and the CCD it uses is great. The product was released  only in Sept 2001 so most of its technology is new.<br />Look for MSN holiday shopping reward on 800 dot com and also a gift check back from 800. these all deals plus excellent picture quality make it a great camera for this holiday season.<br />(there's a 128MB smartmedia card available from buy dot com for only 40).","I bought one a few days ago, was very easy to get it going, manual was pretty good, once you get used to navigating around the menus its very easy and well thought out.<br />What I was really impressed with how neat looking it was, and having been around photography for a while and having owned some Fuji Point and Shoot cameras I knew it had to be good, Fuji always makes Point and shoots that are not expensive and work just beautifully.<br />The 2600 is quick handling, focuses outside quickly and a bit slower indoors, the resulting photos were fabulous, razor sharp, no banding and very good color renditions, I like shooting flowers, I usually find that deep red roses turn pink, with the Fuji, what you see is what you get, in my opinion it is impossible to beat this camera, it even ships with a 16 meg smart media card, so on max resolution you can get 20 shots, aint great but beats an 8 meg card, decrease the resolution and number of shots increase dramatically, regardless, I just ordered a 32 meg card, battery life with included 1750 mah batteries and charger is quite good.<br />If you want a digital camera, go shopping and look at the 2600, I love it.","Before purchasing the Fuji 2600, I experienced a number of other digital cameras, some costing much more.  Although many of them had more features, none were as reliable.  I finally gave up on the expesive cameras since the extra features (that require the use of the LCD display) are worthless in sunlight anyway.  This is a gadget free camera that takes excellent pictures. I've never missed a shot even when the subjects are in motion.  The fast auto-focus and lack of gadgets makes this camera seemingly foolproof.<br />Sharp, bright and true color (No sign of color aberations, blooming or color saturation) - Quiet fast zoom lense - Downloading pictures is simple and fast - Batteries last longer than any other digital I tried - Camera comes as a complete package (includes rechargeable batteries, compact charger and a reasonable size memory card) - Camera is small & easy to carry (the future of digital cameras) - The F3.8 lens is a bit slow for low light conditions but adequate for most shots and perfect for a camera of this calibre - The optical view finder shows only 80% size of final photo (Most cameras seem to do this and I don't understand why, however, you do learn to compensate).<br />I've had my camera for about 2 weeks.  Already 2 of my friends have purchased the same camera after seeing it.  It's a reliable camera at a great price.  I highly recommend it.","This camera excels in the ease of use, features and quality over any other camera in its price range.  Setup is a snap and the quality of photos are great.  The corresponding software is easy to install and very user friendly.  Transferring the pictures to my PC is very easy and quick.<br />This camera a true value for the money.  My only complaint is the fact that it eats batteries like candy.  But then again, that is a typical day in the life of any digital camera.  A quick charger and a handful of batteries will keep the camera happy:>","I would have to say that this one of the best digital cameras i have seen in this price range. You are going to have a hard time finding something that is as compact and easy to use as this. The auto mode works great in almost all situations and with a 64MB, i never run out of space. Two things that bug me are, that if you use the supressed flashmode (no flash) then you really need to hold it very still because you can get a blurry shot very easily. And, even though you can have a card that fits a lot more than a 20second movie you still can only save in increments of 20 seconds(3 megs i believe). Overall I still think this camera is a great buy and i wouldnt hesitate to reccomend it to any of my friends.","I bought this camera to take photos of our new baby as I was fed up using a 35mm and taking 10 good shots every 25 shots and paying for them all to be developed. This camera is great, takes great shots (the macro is super for close ups at high resolution). The controls are easy once you get the hang of them. 20 photos at highest resolution with the card good for printing 8x10s. A lens cover and recharchable batteries and recharger. You don't need any extra to get started. A great buy and now I only print out the photos I like.","This camera is really an incredible deal.  It has more features for the money that any other camera in its range.  Other cameras that are similarly priced lack the 2-megapixel sensor or optical zoom, but the FinePix 2600 has both.  It takes very nice pictures and is very easy to use.  It comes with a 16MB card that provides more than enough initial storage, and new cards can be purchased up to 128MB.  But even the standard card holds a lot - 60 at the default setting, 10 at the highest setting.  The optical zoom is a great feature to have, and the movie mode is also very useful.  Despite what some specs may read, it has both a macro mode and a self-timer.  Overall, this is the best camera to buy in its range, that is, more than a toy but not high-end.  It is more than adequate for the casual or amateur photographer.  It should serve all your photography needs for quite some time.","This is an absolutely wonderful camera.  It's got all of the features that a home photographer could want.  I've seen folks complain about the fact that the 16M media isn't a flash card...but who cares?  After a day of picture taking you plug the camera into your PC and copy the pictures to your hard drive.  What do flash cards matter?<br />I'm VERY happy with this purchase; this camera is cheaper than comparable offerings from Sony and does it all...no complaints!","I've looked at a lot of cameras, this is the first camera, in it's price range, which really delivers on it's promise.  The 1.8\" LCD is quite adequate and is much better than on earlier finepix models. Finally, this model comes with video and a 16MB smartcard.  You should buy a larger card if you intend to use the video feature.  This is a great point and shoot camera, which shares the features of other, more expensive competitors.","I love this camera. It's easy to use and good price too. It's charger and battery kit and 16MB card makes it better than competitor's 2M pixel offering. My only negative is the Smartmedia card, it should have been flash card since more people use flash cards. anyway, it's great camera."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 885","amazon_reviews":["Perfect running condition, just as promised. Even had a battery inside.  Arrived safely - right on time.","I have had this camera since 2000 and it was my first digital.  However during my sons college graduation last year I received the System Error message (which meant no pictures) and after powering down and up again received the Warning! Remove Lens Cap error (lens cap not on).  I couldn't use it all that weekend but a week later it worked fine so I thought it was the southern heat.  However, it has started with both errors again and I cannot use it for anything.  It even says System Error then it is turned off (hmmm).  Can't say I would buy another Nikon.

However during my sons college graduation last year I received the System Error message (which meant no pictures) and after powering down and up again received the Warning! Remove Lens Cap error (lens cap not on).  I couldn't use it all that weekend but a week later it worked fine so I thought it was the southern heat.  However, it has started with both errors again and I cannot use it for anything.  It even says System Error then it is turned off (hmmm).  Can't say I would buy another Nikon.

I had only half a day to play with it before we went and that was pretty much enough.  My travel pictures were gorgeous.  I only missed a couple of nighttime action shots and even they ended up being kinda cool because of the obvious movement they showed.  The camera is so small and well designed that I carried it everywhere.  It was never in the way and I got some fantastic pictures.<br />The shutter delay that some people have complained about is a problem but not a big one unless you're a sports photographer.  You learn to accommodate it.  It was the one problem that almost kept me from buying this camera but I'm glad I took the chance.<br />I had no problem with the battery life as long as I didn't leave the camera on too long when I wasn't taking pictures.  I'd charge it at night and it usually lasted me all day.  If I were a real serious photographer, I think I'd want to carry a spare but for vacation snapshots, this one worked just fine.  I averaged about 60 shots per day with no problem.<br />The only complaint I had was that my dinosaur computer didn't want to recognize my camera when I attempted to upload the pictures.  First I had to upgrade my OS.  Windows 98 just wasn't good enough.  Even then it took me a couple of attempts to get the process to work.  That's probably the fault of my computer but it's rather annoying that they don't make the software work for past Windows versions.","great size that fits the hand.  good quality photos.  easy to use controls on unit.  software to pc somewhat complex","I have owned the 885 for 1 year, I love it, you can take pictures in almost any condition, Its very easy to use,<br />The optional Fisheye Lense brings picture taking to a whole new level. Also the Wide angle lense almost doubles your picture size. The only thing wrong with this camera is it takes 45 second videos, Which is amazing, But it doesnt record sound.<br />I called Nikon weeks after I purchased it & They couldnt tell me why. I am now buying the 5700 which takes 60 sec. Videos with sound Also has an extra Megapixel & 8x digi Zoom.<br />All in All Its a Great Camera for the price.","I have searched for several weeks for a digital camera, and although I own a Canon Elan 7e conventional SLR, I went ahead with Nikon and I am very pleased for having made this choice.<br />If you want to get a 3-4 MP camera, I would like to tell you why you should consider this camera:<br />1. Excellent optics. Very crisp pictures, good color adjustment. (you can always depend on Nikon because the commpany is dedicated to optical instruments in contrast to some other companies who produce digital cameras, speakers, PDAs, TVs, radios, keyboards etc at the same time! Makes sense?).<br />2. Size: It is compact and light but at the same time gives you the feeling of holding a camera and not some nonspecific electronic rectangular object (which I value very much).<br />3. The zoom: 3x optical zoom is not provided by other brands with similar value and MP. They all offer digital zoom and all of us know what that means!<br />4. Software: Very intuitive and easy to learn. I did not have to read the manual to understand the menus and that is a great plus. The Custom mode offers several settings from room lighting type to bracketing, and several other stuff that you will enjoy using. But the bottom line is, you actually can get to use the camera the way you want to just by the click of  a single button.<br />5. The Macro mode: Fantastic! You can get close up from 1.6 inches and this is real. Try the other cameras and get  a close up at that distance. I have tried but could not succeed. If you are going to use the Macro mode, be sure to try all the brands but when you try, you will see that Nikon has an excellent macro mode.<br />One problem I have encountered is the focusing sound the camera produces when it focuses. However, at day 2, I realized that it was due to the default continuous AF mode and when I switched it to single AF, there was virtually no sound. If that sound had persisted, the camera rating would have been 4 stars and I am so glad that you can actually get rid of that sound. Some people may not find it bothering but I did!<br />Amazon offered it at a great price when I bought it and I don't know if they will continue selling it because it is so good you don't need any better (unless you want to print pictures with sizes > 11x14 inches, where Coolpix 4300 or 4500 would be better suited to your intentions. However, for that paper size, remember that each shot will be of about 2 MB size)<br />I definitely recommend this camera to people looking for 3-4 MB range. Just try it before buying any digital camera. You will notice the difference.","I bought this camera about 8 months ago. I'm a grad student in a design related subject, so I often need to take several dozen reference pictures in a short period of time (many of which I won't keep).  Digital is a great way to go considering film processing costs.<br />The good about this camera is that the image quality is high.  I use it in high resolution mode, so I have more flexibility to manipulate the photos later in Photoshop.  It also has a surprising ability to shoot in low-ish light without its flash.<br />It is a very simple camera to use.  I don't use any of the proprietary software that came with it, such as the photo organizing software, but instead simply plug it into a USB port and treat it like an external drive.  It also comes with a battery and charger, which seems to last for about 40 or 50 pictures (depending).  I usually leave it to charge in the evening overnight and it is fine.<br />However, there are also a few frustrating aspects.<br />The software that it comes with is pretty much junk, so if you don't already have a graphics package on your computer, this is worth considering.  I never really figured out how to use the photo database program effectively, because it told me it had \"expired\" after only a dozen or so pictures were down loaded (apparently a $[amount] camera still doesn't get you a full licensed software package--which it later prompts you to buy).  I would ignore the included software completely.<br />The camera also really likes the colors red and orange, and they sometimes turn out nearly neon.  Again, if you have Photoshop or something like it, this can  easily be corrected (and it doesn't really bother me).<br />Likewise, this camera doesn't have many modes like B/W and sepia like some other cameras (i.e. Sony) have, but if you are into digital manipulation this is easy enough to do yourself.<br />Like most digital cameras, the memory included is way too small to be useful.  The one accessory that I purchased was a 128 mb flash memory card.  Although 128 mb is a lot, I would say that the minimum needed for this camera is probably 64 mb.  So add about $[amount]to the price for your memory.<br />Other annoying aspects:  there is a pretty big shutter delay from when you press the button, meaning that this camera will not work well for sports or action shots.  Also, even when the battery is fully charged, my camera goes to standby after only about 15 seconds, and takes a few seconds to come back on.  I've tried to change this, but the settings seem to have no effect.  So again, spontaneity is not it's strong suit.<br />Overall, a functional camera that is reliable and works well, but with a few wrinkles.  It is about what I expected from a \"newfangled\" emerging technology.","This is my first digital camera.  I have an original Nikon F and a Nikon 6006 (both SLR's, obviously).  When I ventured into the digital foray, I couldn't bring myself to get anything other than a Nikon.  Boy, was I right!  It's easy to use:  charge the battery, put the starter memory disk in, set it on Auto, and you're off to the races!  You get about 20 pics on the memory disk.  I recommend getting a 128 MB card (Simpletech has a good one), three extra batteries (they die quickly while you're shooting away!), and a case.  All personal preference, and not required.  Enjoy your excellent purchase!","the nikon 885 is the best camera I have ever owned. so many features to 30 sec films at 29 fps with no sound.  excellent pictures too.  You must purchase an extra memory card and tripod if your serious about this camera.","I waited six months to review the Coolpix 885 to see how it was to really live with this camera.  After shooting over 2,000 exposures, I can tell you that I love the 885.  Anyone who is not satisfied with the results has got to buy a new printer and try again is all I can say.  Try taking photos in the FINE mode and you will be very satisfied with all but insanely huge enlargements.  Use the HIGH resolution (.TIF) and it will be difficult to hurt the resolution in any enlargement.  (I know you think you are not enlarging very much, but if you take the center 10% of an image and try to make it into an 8x10 print, that is a monstrous enlargement.)  This camera is good for a family where on might leave the camera set on full autoprogrammed mode and the other would prefer the absolutely total controll offered in the Custom Shooting Mode.  Guess what.  About 95% of the time, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  It is a huge plus that the 885 will take macro shots from about one INCH away.  It is a huge plus that the optical zoom range is 4:1 with another 4x digital zoom.  It is a huge plus that you can zoom in 4x when viewing an image in the monitor so you can evaluate focus in critical areas.  My only complaint is that the f: stops are not really f: stops and I wish that were not the case.  You have complete control over the shutter speeds from 1/1000th to 8 seconds, but there are only two apertures to toggle back and forth between.  I guess that's one reason to go up a level, but then you have to deal with a swivel in the middle of the camera and I am always afraid something like that is one more weak link that is destined to break.  Buy at least two rechargeable batteries and 128 or larger Compact Flash Memory.  Buy a USB card reader and don't hook the camera to your computer to download images.  Just read them directly off the card.  This will save batteries immensely.  With the price hovering in the [$] range now, I think the 885 is the one to snap up before it is discontinued.  It's a bargain.","I am an amateur the pictures I take are of friends, family and pets.  That said.  I LOVE this camera.  It goes everywhere with us.  (We did get a second rechargable battery and a 128Mb card.)<br />I get great print results and we love being able to e-mail holiday pictures to out-of-towners (the small pik mode is great). We bought it used and complained about color issues but called Nikon they suggested doing a reset and it's been great since.<br />For those of you using Windows don't even bother loading the software!  Windows XP recognizes the camera as a drive and brings up a wizard for you.  Since little retouching is required I just use the retouching from the ofoto.com and the ones I print at home or have them print onto photo paper come out great.<br />My only complaint is the time lapse from pressing the shutter release to image capture. I find that it's better with a fresher battery but most of the people we're snapping are already adjusted to the delay.","The biggest problem I had was loading software as it was confusing. Take some advice, don't try to use the connection to the camera & computer on a USB hub extension it will not work! They said that in instructions & it was true!","I recently bought this camera from Amazon as a replacement for a Sony FD75. The Sony FD75 is a 640x480 camera that writes to floppy disks and has a 10x Optical zoom. I was never very impressed with the optics of the Sony and wanted to upgrade.<br />After a lot of research, I had narrowed the field down to the Canon Elphs, the Mionlta Diamage and the CoolPik 885. All were within the same price range, basic size, and feature set. The Nokia was the clear leader. Buyer beware, this camera is offered in two retail packages. The earliest package does not include a rechargable battery, and many outlets still want the same price for that version as Amazon charges for this version. The Amazon version has the rechargable battery, will still use the disposable battery, and, with no shipping, handling, and tax, is about the BEST deal I could find on this camera anywhere in the US.<br />The Camera is full featured and has a wide range of custom, pre-set, and auto settings. The pictures are crisp, the colors vivid, and the details clear. Great optics. Unfortunately, the one complaint I have that keeps this camera from having a 5 star rating is the *significant* delay between pressing the shutter release and the actual image being taken. Not just recorded to the media, there is as much as a 1 second delay from the time you release the shutter button to the time the image is taken. For taking landscapes, snapshots, and other fairly static images, this is not a problem, but it renders the camera virtually useless for action shots, unless you have ESP. Taking pictures of my 1 year old daughter is very frustrating, because her attention span often doesn't hold until the picture is actually taken. Instead of her flashing a beautiful and charming smile, I get the side of her face as she turns to look at something else as often as not. Outside of this, I would recommend this camera as the best deal currently on the market for a full featured, very portable high resolution digital camera.<br />Late update: I discovered that the delay is caused by the red-eye reduction. By turning the flash off or selecting the non red-eye reduction flash mode, the delay between the shutter release and the picture being taken is reduced dramatically. Perhaps the only fault of this camera is the movie mode has no audio, in comparisson to other similar cameras that do. I considered the movie mode an added bonus, but have found it a great way to take small clips for my website that easily convert into streaming .asf files with the included software. In either case, I gave the camera a 5 star review after discovering the red-eye reduction delay. Honestly, it is probably like a 4.8 star item. It isn't perfect. $100 less and with audio, and it would be.","I've got this camera for about 6 months now and used it durning normal weather, rainstorms and even in the desert of Egypt. The pictures are allway bright, collerfull and sharp.<br />The camera is east to handle, had a firm grip and the battery is lasting for almost 70 pictures (incl flash and just waiting for the best moment).<br />It realy deserves the 5 starts!","I have had my Coolpix 885 for 6 months and am very happy with it.  It is very solidly built and small in size, which is handy for traveling.  I normally have the quality setting on fine, size setting on XGA and the picture quality is excellent, very sharp and clear.  I especially like the on-camera feature that allows you to make a small file size copy of pictures for emailing.  It takes the picture file size from 300 Kbytes to about 70 Kbytes while leaving the original untouched.  I found the file transfer software supplied with the camera unsatisfactory - no bother though since I just plug the memory card into the computers USB port using a card reader. The computer then recognizes the memory card as just another drive. I then use Windows Explorer to transfer the pictures to my computer  a very fast way to transfer pictures. The Scene mode is excellent for a point and shoot photographer like me, automatically setting up the camera for 12 different scene types.  The Auto and Scene modes on this camera make it VERY easy to use if you want it that way. If you want to operate it manually it will also oblige.  The cameras use of a Compactflash card allows me to use a memory card adaptor accessory to plug the card into my laptops PCMCIA card slot to place pictures onto the laptop, very handy when traveling.  I would recommend obtaining a larger memory card than the 16 meg card supplied with the camera.  I also love the ability to preview pictures on TV with the very easy to use video cable setup ? just plug the camera directly into the TV or VCR and view the pictures.  This camera has more features than I will ever use but if you want to take quality movies a purpose built video camera is advisable. As with all still picture digital cameras, dont expect quality videos.  The flash red eye reduction seems effective but its power over distance isn?t great This seems to be a common complaint with most digital cameras from the reviews I have read.  Rechargeable batteries are a good idea ? the number of shots the battery is good for varies for each person depending on how they use the camera.  I get about 80 shots per battery charge with the rechargeable battery and about 130 pictures with the disposable. I use the LCD screen all the time and frequently preview my pictures on the LCD screen with the preview feature.  Its a good idea to always carry a spare battery.  I found the owners manual comprehensive and easy to understand.  Overall I am very happy with my purchase and having read reviews for many other brands I am convinced I bought the right camera for me.  It is small, feature packed but very easy to use and value for money.","A friend loaned me her Nikon Coolpix 885 over the 4th of July weekend so that I could try it out. I loved the camera and the quality of the pictures taken at the Fine setting. As result, I went out and purchased one for myself the same weekend. The degree of custom control is also excellent, making this camera good for both the beginner and more advanced photographers. I was very pleased with the image quality even in dim indoor light without the flash.<br />I have read reviews on ohter Web sites where people complained about image quality being poor. I can't understand where they are coming from. The pictures that I took in Fine mode were very sharp and crisp. I used the 3X Optical Zoom and still the pictures were sharp.<br />In the short time that I had my friend's camera, the only drawback I could find was that there is quite a bit of glare in the view finder if you are shooting in bright sun, but other than that, it is an excellent camera for the money.","As a first time digital camera user I found the Nikon 885 extremely simple and user-friendly. The user manual is very easy to understand and it is easy to find what you need. The small size is great for traveling. The shutter speed seems fine to me although I heard some people found it to be very slow on their cameras.<br />One of my favorite things about the camera is the movie feature. You can make a 40 second movie without sound and play it on your computer. I was impressed with the quality and even in fine mode the 'movie' only takes up the memory space of 7 or 8 pictures. Which is hardly anything if you have the 128 mb card which takes 80 pictures in fine mode, 157 in normal mode and 302 in basic mode.<br />One of the bonuses of owning a Nikon is that the memory card that it takes is made by several different companies and therefore cheaper and easier to find. The Sonys, on the other hand, only accept Sony Memory sticks, which is very annoying because some computers and printers do not accept the Sony disk, while almost every device will take the one used for Nikon. I bought a device to plug into my USB port that I can insert the disk into to download onto my computer so that the battery of my camera isn't running out while it uploads. Oh while I'm on the subject of batteries another great thing about Nikon is that it has an adapter to charge your battery outside of the camera so if you have 2 batteries, one can be charging while you're using the camera. Oh, and if you are on vacation or something out sightseeing and your battery goes dead you can run into a shop and buy regular camera batteries b/c Nikon made their cameras to accept them too.<br />Another one of my favorite things is the scene modes. This is something that was important for me because I know very little about photography. I really needed a camera that I could just point and shoot and Nikon was the only brand the scene selection feature where you don't have to focus it and decide whether to use flash or not and all that stuff. The twelve scenes are portrait, party/indoor, night portrait, beach/snow, landscape, sunset, night landscape, museum, fireworks show, close up, copy (black & white), and back light.<br />Well I hope you found this review helpful. Obviously I'm very happy with my Nikon 885. If your looking for a cute, compact, easy to use camera then this would be a good choice.

The point and shoot options are easy, but there are plenty of bells and whistles if you want to do more advanced photography. The manual is good and easy to follow.","I've had this camera for a week and am thoroughly impressed.<br />LOTS of controls (manual) and a dozen \"scene\" presets augment a fine \"auto\" system for point-and-shoot through numerous custom options.

The owner's manual is well-organized and guides the user through a myriad of options. Most of the controls are intuitive and easily remembered, making this camera a pleasure to use.<br />The camera's small size makes it easy to pack along on any outing: which gave me the opportunity to snap photos of a car fully aflame by the roadside last night! The preview screen is on the small size, but adequate. The bundled software package is also good.<br />Check out the web for more detailed reviews, but I couldn't be more delighted (without spending well over $1,000)."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P3","amazon_reviews":["I bought this when it was first released for $500.

After reading the reviews, i was surprised at how old this camera was! 2002 was 3 years ago! And yet, this camera does a good job. 3.2 mpx is nothing, compared to the average now (around 4-5 mpx standard) but i must say this camera is good. For a 3.2 megapixle, this camera has very fine pictures. It is well worth it and does not lag as my old camera did. The negative effect of the camera is that after a while (3 years .. :P) the battery was worn out. It barely works for 10 seconds at a time before it says it needs a recharge. Other than that, the camera is good. I like it. But for the 2005-ers, there are much better cameras out there for cheaper prices. And more thin ones.<br /><br />For 2002, this is a very good camera.","I purchased this camera about a year and a half ago on eBay, I paid about $220 for it ($160 for the camera, and the rest was on the battery, charger and memory stick). It's a very nice design, with a large screen and a solid feel, and not at all too large. The picture quality was fantastic, I had no complaints. However, I had to give the camera up to my mother because the low-light pictures were AWFUL. The night I bought it, I took the camera to a minor-league wrestling show, and we compared the photos to my friend's four-year-old Olympus camera. The difference was striking- his photos came out much better, mine were either too dark, or terrifically blurry (those were in night mode). Again, if you are going to be taking photos in the light, for a party or outdoors in the daytime, you will love this camera. In the dark? Stay away!","I have had this camera for almost 2 years and have had no problems with it at all.  The battery lasts for over an hour and they are so tiny, I always carry a spare.  I have been looking for a newer camera and have noticed they are not made nearly as well.  The p5 is small and lightweight but feels solidly built and I like the glass protecting the lcd.  I have been very pleased with the photos it takes, even the nightshots.  My only complaint is that the movie mode does not do well in low-light conditions. The controls are easy to work, very user friendly, and the camera takes great pictures.","Here is the shutter specs right from sony:<br />Maximum shutter speed: .001 seconds<br />Minimum shutter speed: 2 seconds<br />So why are people complaining about the shutte speed? Isn't it something that you can adjust?","I love this camera!  I have owned my P5 for about 2 years now, and have had excellent results.  I have quite a bit of 35mm equipment as well, but haven't touched it since getting this camera.  I am quite a perfectionist when it comes to photo quality and have been very satisfied with the quality of images produced by this model.  It's very easy to carry around, and the 3.2 MP resolution is sufficient for most of my needs.  I would recommend this camera.<br />The only negative I have noticed so far is with the automatic lens cover.  Sometimes it seems to stick, and not open all the way. I simply touch it, very gently, and it opens fully.  I may need to get it cleaned to keep it working smoothly. This happens very infrequently, so it's not a major issue, simply a periodic inconvenience.","Pros:  I bought this because I wanted something dinky to replace my unwieldy 3.5\" disk-using Sony Mavica. It's sleek, styley, and nicely pocket-sized. The pics are reasonably decent, and I think 3 megapixels is enough, unless you're planning on printing billboards.<br />Cons:  The flash isn't that fantastic; indoors and at night, my pics come out not-so-hot. The flash, even on high, isn't really powerful enough to illuminate things that aren't in good lighting. The battery life kind of sucks (60 mins but it really seems to last more like 30-40 mins) with the LCD on, but lasts longer with it turned off. I just take this as a necessary evil and charge the camera whenever I get a chance. The extra battery you can buy has a life of ~70 minutes (it started at 75 when I first bought it but only charges up to about 70 now). As long as you keep an extra battery on hand, charge it frequently, and are conscious of keeping the LCD screen off it's not too bad. You really need to purchase a bigger memory stick (I recommend 128 MB memory stick: stores ~82 pics at highest resolution and quality), but nearly every digital camera on the market comes with something silly like 8 MB.","I was so surprised of the quality of this camera ! My daughter got this for Christmas and she fell in love with it.","This camera was not met to be used in advance applications but simply general photography taking. Plus with its slim design it can travel when ever a interesting event sparks about in daily life. Just be sure to in recommendation to read a photography user guide book to have a introduction to iso, exposure, and timing of the shot. It will certainly help have create some future shots that are amazing.","I recieved this camera from a friend not a while ago for free. After reading the reviews, i was surprised at how old this camera was! 2002 was 3 years ago! And yet, this camera does a good job. 3.2 mpx is nothing, compared to the average now (around 4-5 mpx standard) but i must say this camera is good.

Battery life is not that great, but the small size accounts for that. Ask yourself how big of a battery do you want to carry? The size of this camera, plus the ease of use were my main draws.<br />My biggest gripe is the location of the on/off switch. If you're not careful you will turn it off while taking pictures. I've noticed Sony has corrected this on other models.<br />The case of this camera is built like a tank. Some of the newer stuff looks cheaper.<br />Accessories are hard to find. You really have to be persistant to find different battery chargers. The charger that comes with the camera, requires the camera be utilized in the charging. I bought a charger that charges two batteries independant of the camera. A vehicle charger would be nice but this has eluded me.<br />I constantly get good comments,from auction buyers, about my picture quality. It has to be the camera.","I have been waiting to get a digital camera until they were more reasonably priced and offered better features. This camera is about the same size as a pocket 35mm camera is. It takes great pictures and video clips with sound. I really enjoy playing with it and trying new things to see how it works. The only downfall is the battery life which is usually about an hour. I brought it to the zoo with me and I got some really great closeups and all but I had to change the battery twice while I was there. The memory sticks are great and very compact and depending on the pixel setting they can hold a lot of photos. It is very easy to upload the pictures to your pc and import into one of my photo programs to touch them up and what not. I am in no way a professional photographer but this camera is great for my needs.","Dont let small size confuse you. This little guy puts out beautiful pictures.The key is a good quality photo printer or good dye printer.I continue to put out beautiful 8x10s with this little guy.If the price is right go for it.","Design of this camera is perfect, it is small and extra light, the picture it takes is also good in quality, but talking about features, you can't use it as a professional camera, becausa in doesn't have manual focus ring, manual shutter speed, etc. There's also no additional lenses.","With the Sony CyberShot, you'll notice a strange thing - you'll take more pictures.  Even though I have a great Canon Elan 35mm, I end up using my CyberShot more frequently due to its size (it fits in my pocket) and because its digital (it holds more photos and you can erase your mistakes).  Whereas I once only took my 35mm on major trips or events, I end up taking my CyberShot everywhere with me.<br />Operating the camera is intuitive including easy to navigate menus on the LCD screen.  When viewing pictures on the camera, you can zoom in and out to get a better sense of how they'll look.  The Sony has a great recovery rate as well - some cameras require a 7 sec wait between pictures as it stores the previous one.  The Sony has been under 3 secs for me most of the time.  Finally, you can use the included cables to plug your camera into a television to view your pictures through a slide show mode.<br />One feature that I'm surprised I use so often is the ability to record short MPEG movies.  You'll be amazed how often you'll use this just to record a short greeting or capture a fun moment.  The quality isn't great, but it is good enough to share with friends via email.<br />My only recommendation would be to go ahead and invest in a larger memory stick.  I have a 128 meg stick and it can store over one hundred pics plus a couple seconds of video.  You'll never have to worry about running out of memory.<br />This is a great camera - one you'll use more often than you think.  You'll love the ease of use, the great picture quality, and some of the extra features you never thought you needed before you had them available.","I love this camera, it takes absolutely great pictures in rapid succession and with impressive quality.  The batteries last a long time. The pictures are easy to transfer to your computer with the adapter provided.  The flash recycles quickly, the camera is easy to focus, and shots can be reviewed & kept or discarded quickly.  It is all the camera you need if you do not want to make 8X10's, as the pictures are really sharp (SLR Quality) at sizes up to 4 X 6 & 5 X 7, but the quality starts to deteriorate at sizes larger than that, which is what more megapixels is all about.  If you want bigger pictures with the same high resolution, I'd suggest putting out the extra bucks to acquire a Sony DSC- F707 5 megapixel camera, or its competitor the Nikon 5000 CoolPix. Personally, I can do without 8 X 10's for the extra money it takes to move to that level of digital camera.","This is a great camera.  I only wish I could have gotten it on clearance.  Now is your chance to purchase a very good digital camera at a decent price.  I think 3 megapixels is going to be the standard for awhile now and this is the best 3 megapixel camera I've seen.  It is small and easy to carry with you on trips.  It holds 45 pics on a 64 meg card with the setting on the highest quality.  It will even take black and white photos which is very cool when taking pics of ancient places which is what I use it for mostly.  I have gotten a lot of use out of this camera and I have no plans of upgrading to the latest and greatest (yet).  For now I'm happy with this one.","if your thinking about getting the sony p5 , dont think anymore, just go out and buy it, i went to yellowstone and tetons right after i got mine(the reason for getting it) and the pics came out looking like postcards. They were so good. I love this camera to death. it also does all the little extras, hq mpegs with sounds for 15 seconds at 5 mb or on ex mpeg with sound for exactly 23:38(with my 128mb stick)and there are still shots with up to 40 secs of sound and animated gif pics, for the amound of things it does im amazed at the small size and simplicity of the menu, it also feels good and stiurdy and well built, it also has fast processing speed, i wasnt sure if the pics were taking right cuz it was writing them onto the card so fast but they are all really good, there is even a 2048 3 by 2 ratio pic so you can print out border edged 4\"by 6\" print on your photo printer, anyway this camera will not disapoint anyone who buys it., i have had alot of cameras and done alot of research and this is the nicest i have seen(exept for possibly the higher model cybershots i dont know) anyway go out and buy this as soon as you can!!!","Bought the P-5 last January 2002.  Read its manual in details.  You should too.  It will help you understand this new technology.  You can achieve much more with a digicam.  I suspect people who are unhappy with this camera have not read the manual in detail.<br />It is a small camera with a lot of punch and options.  Its small size does not mean compromise.  I suggest you buy 128 MB of memory.  It is nice to not worry about running out of memory.  One full day will drain the battery (as with all digicams).  So take along the charger (for the hotel room and recharge when you sleep, although it does not take THAT long to charge it) or buy extra an battery.  We take the charger with us on overnights and it works.  No need to spend extra $$ on the extra battery.  Buy the extra memory instead.<br />A Plus:  The videos I take with this camera (and the extra memory) are great.  I did not expect to get such nice videos with a \"still\" camera.<br />I am not an expert.  I have made mistakes taking a few shots and have been able to correct some of them with the MGI Photo Suite software that comes with the camera.  Others, were beyond rescue  ;)<br />The vast majority of the shots come out beautifully.<br />Bottom line: get a small (palm size) tripod for night shots, get 128MB extra memory and this camera.  The tiny size of it all and its power will ensure you take it with you and use it all the time.  No need to slug around a whole bag of camera stuff!","I got this camera last month. I chose it, because it is pretty small and 3.2 megapixel. Here are my comments:  Advantages:Small, 3.2 megapixel, zoom is good<br />Disadvantages:you will need a large capacity memory stick and a spare battery is necessary. It is not great at night shots. It is not fast when you are taking photos, i mean yo gotta wait like at leat 2 seconds to take another shot. Even dsc p71 is faster.","i've had about a dozen dcams, and this one<br />is the best very small unit. 3 meg, 3x zoom,<br />movies w/ sound. big jump to sony accessories,<br />but in this case worth it. cool features for<br />dark shooting, and on-camera creativity. in<br />email mode, for example, it records two images<br />automatically, one small. and it copies.now<br />we need larger sticks, and longer batteries","This is a great camera, period.<br />But I have few comments. I had a Sony DSC-50, and with that camera I was able to make perfect-exposure panoramic photos using MGI's Photovista; I locked the aperture and all the photos had the same exposition, creating an almost perfect composite from several pictures. The P5 is unable to do so, since it changes both the exposure and shutter speed  automatically (however the final result is OK anyway). Also, the DSC-50 was able to take exposures up to 8 seconds, and the P5 is limited to 2 sec. More: since the lens is smaller, it gathers less light, and pictures are dark in dim light (say under a 40 or 60W fluorescent light). Finally: The battery in the P5 lasts less than an hour (I got used to 2.5 hours from my DSC-50) (I'm ordering one from Amazon, by the way).<br />BUT, it has all the other features I wanted in a camera, too long to list here, like the best color reproduction among many other models, the tiny size and good resolution (3.3 megapixels). That's why I think it is the almost perfect camera in the digital camera market, and the larger size DSC-50 no longer exists.","It's very handy to have so many features in such a small size. The memory stick size of 8MB which comes with the package is never sufficient if you wanna use all the features of the camera; Sony should put at least 64MB of memory in the pack.<br />The CCD and auto detection for the settings is slow most of the time. The battery is not sufficient when you feel free to use the flash; you can have 40 shots most with the flash and the display on. If you plan to buy this camera, it's a great choice but order 128MB memory and an extra battery as well.","The greatest thing about this camera is that it is a very high resolution digital, that takes stunning photos, and it actuall fits in the pocket of your jeans!<br />Memory stick prices are dropping, and with a 128 MB memory stick, you can shoot away until your heart is content, and scrap what you don't like.<br />GREAT picture quality, and the ultimate in portability","I've just got this DSC-P5 as a gift. Everything looks fine and it's a user friendly. I've tried on special effects and it looks great. The bad thing is only that the battery doesn't last for long as they'd advertised. I follwed the instruction strictly but it doesnt work. The battery lasts only for not more than an hour. I'm so disappointed with the battery.","Excellent camera with most features that is really fits in the pocket.  For this price Sony should include storage of 64MB or even 128MB.  Selling this camera with 8MB of memory is like selling a 911Turbo with a 5 gallon gas tank.<br />I wonder why Sony is sticking with a storage format that is non-standard for the industry now... a little like Betamax here.  A camera case with spare battery should have been included as well since the camera does not accept AA batteries.<br />The lettering that comes on both LCD displays are hard to read depending on the lighting... could be improved.<br />Ajit.","I decided to purchase a digital camera after I used an old Panasonic 1.3 mega pixel at work.  I did a little research and decided I wanted a small entry-level camera with the latest features.  I got just what I wanted in this ultra-compact model with all the bells and whistles.  It's a breeze to use.  I was up and shooting within minutes of opening the box.  I'm not so impressed with the battery life so I ordered an additional battery and a charger.  Be prepared to fork out a couple of hundred bucks for accessories like at least128MB of memory, a memory stick reader, extra battery, and charger.  Overall, I don't think I could have made a better choice for my first digital camera.","Best of Sony Digital! It has picture quality for it's size. This is the 3rd sony digital camera products I have tried. Basically complains from previous model has been corrected on p5. Especially flash or lights indoor. If your new to digital you will also complain about battery. Older digital cameras, regardless of brand, drains power so quickly. This is normal! I guess, the only complain other people will be then, is the size, so tiny w/c you might accidentally drop. For me, size is perfect, I like to have the camera handy all the time. When I need it, it's there. Before I decided to buy this camera these are the choices I had in mind (dcs-s75) very good camera especially the lens but bulky, (p-1) good for outdoor bad indoor, especially night time (discontinued anyway)! (cannon s-30) comparable to p-5 but little bit bigger in size. Buy this camera, no regrets!","I originally received the DSC-P30 as a gift, however wanting a 3+ megapixel cam I began my research.  I compared this with the Canon and Olypus 3.x megapixel cameras.  After comparing specs. side by side I liked the size, price and features of the DSC-P5 the best.<br />When I received the camera I was shocked at just how small it really is.  Most impressive.<br />The screen is more than adequate.  The image quality is also impressive.  Also recording mpeg's was both easy and reasonably good quality.<br />Only bad things are that the 8Mb Memory Stick it ships with is really too small.  You need at least 32Mb to do anything substantial away from an opportunity to upload. I would recommend you invest in a 128Mb card though.  Also if you set the photo quality to 'fine' you reduce the number of images the card can store by almost a third, but it is worth it in improved image quality.<br />The power switch is too close to the shutter button.  It is too easy to push it and power down when you need a photo.  Also time between photos in low light can be excruciating.<br />Photo review is easy and you can quickly delete any image you do not like.<br />Overall the Sony DSC-P5 is a great camera.","This camera is absolutely amazing!  It creates incredibly clear images, short video clips complete with sound, and has many other adjustments such as white balance.  The camera is operated by turning the dial on top to one of four settings:  movie mode, playback mode, camera mode, and twilight mode. It even has a thoughtful LCD screen on top telling you how much battery power in minutes is left, eliminating guesswork.  Once you get started taking pictures, the included 8mb memory card won't last long, so it's best to purchase a larger one.  Good news is Sony is currently offering a $50 rebate with the purchase of the camera and a memory card.  In short, this camera offers many features, sharp clear images with its impressive 3.2 megapixel lens, an easy-to-use menu (even for a first-time digital camera purchaser like me), and weighs less than 8 ounces with the long lasting lithium battery and memory card installed.  You won't be sorry if you buy this camera.","I researched long and hard for this Digital camera, and found this to be the best for my needs.  This says a lot because I am an avid Scuba Diver and outdoor enthusiast.  The MPK-P5 is the underwater housing for the P5 that you can ONLY find for this camera, so if you want to get wet, this is your only choice.  It's good to 140 feet under water, so there is a lot you can do with that.  The camera picture quality is great, and the small compact size (small enough to fit in your shirt pocket) makes it the best all around camera I could find.  I would recommend this camera to all.","Having bought a previous sony digi-cam that failed before a big trip, I was somewhat reluctant to buy another sony. However, I returned my failed sony for this model(a DSC-P5 which was also an open box model so I saved $300 - highly recommended if you can find one), I cannot say how delighted I am with this camera. Not only is this one much smaller and handy than the other model, but the features are stellar. The mpeg movie feature w/ sound right out of the camera is fantastic; the picture clarity is awesome, and the LCD screen is larger than most for a camera this size. I've been on 3 other trips since, and have received many inquiries by onlookers on the \"coolness\" of this camera. ***The only downside is, buy a few extra batteries and at least a 64mb stick if not 2, since the 4mb provided will only give you a few pics at the 3.2 resolution and the battery supplied won't last long if you plan to take lots of pics****","I was given this camera for Christmas (2001) as a present from my Girlfriend and am quite familiar with it.  In a nutshell, the camera is excellent.  I had previously used Sony digital cameras on a loan basis throughout Europe and Australia and to own this latest version is just fantastic and I am privileged.<br />The camera comes with software which allows editing of still and mpeg images.  The supplied memory stick however, is only 8meg and this is the only criticism I have.  I bought a 64 meg which helps more.  Will be getting a 128 meg memory stick soon.  Noting the size and quality of the pictures this camera is capable of taking - and the photos are brilliant, you need storage space so at least a 64mb stick is required.  That is unless you want to concentrate on just taking small volume jpg's suitable for emailing.  The camera doesn't come with a cover but this can be purchased separately, or any old camera cover will do.  A spare battery would be a bonus.  I guess its these add-ons which help Sony to maintain the profits....  Once again, only minor criticisms.<br />The quality of the P5 is very good and typical of Sony.  The camera is very small and able to be carried quite easily in a pocket.  Once again, the quality of photos are excellent and with all digital cameras, the savings in the long term must add up through editing the photos you want and simply printing the good ones.  Possession of the software program 'Adobe Photoshop Pro' adds another dimension however the supplied program with the camera is good enough for the average user.<br />What else can I say, other than I highly recommend the P5.  My parents have the P3 which has less zoom and a lower pixel capacity for fine photos and it too is great....","Even though the price was a little much the features and capability of this camera are outstanding.  If you're in the market for a light-weight camera that takes professional quality photos this one is it.","I have researched many cameras and it is difficult to believe which one is the best.  I was looking for clear pictures and an easy to use camera with simple menus.  This camera has it all!  It has clear pictures and it is easy to use.  I can even print my pictures on regular paper and the results are almost the same using photo paper.  This camera also has a movie feature in which you can take a 10 second moving clip with sound of your subject.  However, I'm still trying to figure out the software for this.  If you want a good quality digital camera that takes sharp picutes, is portable and with a dependable name like Sony, this is the camera for you.  Lastly it's best to get a large memory stick, because 8 is not really enough.","This is a great camera.  If you do buy one, you might as well invest in a larger memory stick.  It will only hold one pick at max resolution. However what most people dont know, is that you can take a picture at 2048x1536 and then resize it to a smaller size like 640x480.  This keeps the higher resolution in the image, but just makes it smaller in sheer physical size.  Also, it takes good and lengthy Mpeg clips.  Of course it's not a digital camcorder, but does a very good job.  One feature i find very handy is that you can photograph documents with its built in document option.  I don't have a scanner, but have done this with several documents, and have got very good results.  The macro mode is great, i have taken pictures at 5\" with great results.  The camera is also very small and light weight.  A super deal sony has going on right now is a (...)rebate if you also buy memory stick.  Plus they will give arebate for registering the camera online.  Rebates equal cool.","You will be more than pleased with this product.  It is a breeze to learn, and it takes great pictures.  The 3.2 megapixel provides very sharp pictures on my home printer.  This is my first digital camera, and I am happy to say that it is a great hit.  Can't wait until the holidays for more great shots.  By the way, consider purchasing the 128 meg stick to go with it.  It holds about 70 pictures.  We also purchased a new computer with XP operating system.  The XP compatibility is there.  Actually, it was very easy.  You will be printing pictures within five minutes of getting on your system.","This camera is the perfect pocket or purse powerhouse camera. The on screen menues are very easy to read and the image quality is great.","I have always been anxious about buying a digital camera, did some research and decided to buy this one.  I have the Minolta Maxxum HTsi...still love it but fear that it will now sit on the shelf more often now that I bought the<br />SONY DSC-P5.  I highly recommend this SONY digital camera!!  I went to a holiday party the other night, and shot pictures and short video clips all night long (6pm to 2am).  I did have an extra battery with me and a 64 MB card!  The pictures were crisp with great color!  The zoom feature is great!  The short video clips are good quality too!  What a way to save memories!!  Pictures and video clips all on one memory stick!  The price is worth it!  BUY THIS CAMERA!!","It's easy to see this tiny yet powerful camera getting overlooked on store shelves, but check out the specs! What's more, this camera lives up to them, and means my larger older model digital camera will be sitting on the shelf much of the time. A clear, sharp lens, ultra-convenient size, high resolution images, various \"pro\" features for tweaking settings, five \"movie\" modes in mpeg and gif, including audio. This is an ideal camera for any number of high level amateur or field-light professional situations. Image response time is far better than on the Mavica models, so it is more like classic film photography (avoid the power-save mode if you're into the \"zen\" of photography! -- carry an extra battery instead).","I am a huge fan of digital cameras. I owned a DSC-P1, and it is not so bad for beginners although the price is quite steep.<br />DSC-P5 does not dissapoint. I bought one for my wife, and she's happy, no complaints. :-) The enhancements especially in software dept made it worthwhile even for advanced amateurs. You can actually see the information on your aperture, mode settings for each of your shots. The flash has improved, much better than DSC-P1 which ocassionally gave you reddish hue.<br />SONY has done it's homework on feedback given to DSC-P1. DSC-P5 is thinner, the controls are easier to understand and are put into logical locations. Aesthetically, I give the controls 9 out of 10 points. The on/off switch has been changed from the sliding type to a push button type, which can be annoying at times, but it depends on individual preference.<br />Pictures are not bad at all. I can't see much difference from DSC-P1, but as a satisfied customer of both DSC-P1, and DSC-P5, I can say, you will not be dissapointed."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-F707","amazon_reviews":["complicated but once you figure it out it is great.

You have the option for manual control or fully auto.  It takes great pics and holds a charge for three hours after a full charge.  Picture quality is great and the Night Shot is good with an extra IR light to help distance.","I bought this camera in 2002 for $1000.00 and after 1000's of pictures it is still working as good as the day I bought it. Sony hit the ball out the park with this one.","I love this camera!!!! yes -- it does takes some getting use to concerning hand positioning. After that it is all wonderful. The DSC-F707 is very user friendly, to such an extent even when I let ppl borrow my camera they understand how to use its different features. I've had mine ever since they came out with 'em and its only had to be 'repaired' twice (flash wouldn't pop up, and zoom got stuck which we had fixed by a local repair guy (cheap as in 30 dollars for the flash). I also enjoy the different picture settings, it is wonderful to be able to switch the settings back and forth. I usually use the main setting for portrait shots, and then the smaller settings for regular pics to add to Facebook or other social networking sites. If you are worried about the memory card only taking 12 pics don't be! Using the different settings increases the number of pics that are able to be taken. Personally, the highest I've taken with it was about 94. We went to the zoo. All of those pics I uploaded to my photo album. All were superb quality and looked as if they were professionally shot.<br />Barbara Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia","I bought this camera for infrared photography and am pleased with it using the night mode and an IR filter. The added bonus is the beautiful color rendition for regular photos. Very nice camera.<br /><br />I'd give it five stars if it had a memory function to save your settings.<br />Michelle Ress","I have had three of these cameras since 2001. The first was stolen when I was mugged on the steps of the St. Deny Basilica in Paris. I had already fallen in love with the camera by then. When we returned home, I was blown away with the clarity of the photographs which I'd uploaded to a laptop, fortunately, before the camera was stolen. I only use the optical zoom on this camera and I was particularly impressed with the focus that allowed me to zoom into and blow up a small portion of photos I'd already taken with the zoom lens at its maximum length. I also like the feel of the camera. I know that many people rave about pocket-size cameras, but I'm used to a larger SLR and like the heft of this camera. This past spring as we set out on a two month vacation in Spain and Ireland, my F707 failed me. The card reader stopped working and I had to fall back on a pocket-size Nikon. While it did a credible job, I could definitely see the difference in focus and clarity of the photos that came from it as compared to my Sony F707. When we returned to the states, I inquired about having the Sony repaired and found that it was less expensive to purchase a used F707 than to have mine fixed. That's what I did and I'm now a happy camper again. I love this camera and felt lost without it. I know there are improvements coming down the line, but I'll wait until I can get the same performance in a new camera that I get from this one. The only features I miss from this camera are a better low light capability and a larger memory capacity.","The DSCF707 has a great lens and a lot of functionality (including full manual mode, infra-red capabilities, mpeg w/ audio, etc.).  The main thing for me, though, is how the lens can pivot vertically relative to the body (or the body to the lens?).  This means you don't  have to hold it up to your face--you can take shots discreetly from waist-level or around a corner, or you can hold it up over a crowd for a better angle, and still see the LCD screen.  Very handy, and I don't understand why it's not a common feature.  It came (from benselectronics) without a lens cap (58mm) or the camera-charging unit (Sony AC-L10A) AND a battery (Sony NP-FM50 M) at the very end of it's useful life, but that's all stuff I was able to buy elsewhere.  I don't know how the next generation (the 717) compares, but Sony doesn't make anything along these lines anymore, so get one while you still can, and buy a couple extra batteries in case those become obsoleted too.","I'm out shopping for a new camcorder and am leaning towards a Sony model. This brought to mind my Sony F707.<br /><br />**ON THE UP SIDE**<br /><br />I bought it in 2001 and paid a lot. I think with all the stuff I got with it, it came to about $1300. Best money I ever spent on an electronic device.<br /><br />First off - if you have this camera or are picking one up, drop $10 on an appropriately sized UV lens attachment. It doesn't really change your pictures, at all (it's a clear lens). What it does do, however, is protect your precious and expensive Zeiss lens underneath. Over the years, my UV lens - in place ALL THE TIME - has saved me from trashing the *REAL* lens multiple times. I've had to replace the UV lens twice - at a cost of 20 more dollars. That, my friends, is a bargain compared to the alternative. The fact that you can attach any number of aftermarket things to the lens (because it is standard sized) is just plain awesome.<br /><br />I got a 128MB stick with the camera. Sounds sort of laughable now, but I've operated that camera at the highest resolution for every picture from day ONE. No problem. It still fits 60 or so pictures. Have a laptop handy with a USB stick reader and you've got plenty of storage.<br /><br />I've taken this camera everywhere. From the Mayan ruins in Mexico to the top of the CN Tower in Toronto - the pictures I have taken as a rank amateur have impressed many people. Most recently, I used it at the Philadelphia Phillies World Series Victory Parade in Philly (DUH!). With the way the camera twists, I was easily able to hold it HIGH up over my head and still get exactly the shot I wanted. People see the pictures and think I was in the front row when, in fact, I was about 5 rows people deep into the crowd. The sea of red hats/shirts contrasted against the buildings in a mixed light environment (buildings/shadows/bright spots) looks awesome.<br /><br />There are LOTS of settings to play with if you want to experiment. Some of my coolest shots where nighttime long-exposure pictures of the illuminated Niagara Falls. And I pulled it off without a tripod on hand (hold camera VERY still...LOL).<br /><br />I take a lot of pictures of my kid's sports activities.  While there is a delay on the initial click-to-picture process, it doesn't take long to get used to.  In any event, I find the built-in \"Burst-3\" mode to be very useful for sports.  I've gotten more sweet shots that way - Bursting \"around\" the moment I want to photograph...outstanding.<br /><br />**ON THE DOWNSIDE**<br /><br />In 2004 or so, I suffered the very common \"loose focus ring\" problem. This was followed in 2005 by the [very related] \"front part of camera falls off\" problem and it \"now rattles inside\" problem (loose screws). It seems there are a few screws that hold that whole mess together on the inside that have a tendency to come loose. Fortunately, at the time, I found a forum on a website that included a posting of the nature of the problem and the steps (step-by-step screenshots/descriptions) to repair it without having to take it to Sony. It is very particular about how it comes apart and (of course) goes back together. If you have the \"loose focus ring problem\" - or the more advanced stage of that, the \"lens falls off front of camera problem\", let me know. I saved it and will send you the repair guide in .PDF format. thedunlapfamilyATcomcastDOTnet.<br /><br />EDIT:  At this time (April 2009), this repair guide to which I just referred is still on the Internet.  Find it here:  [...]<br /><br />BTW - I came to realize the common problem(s) described above are caused by the relatively \"violent\" spring action of the pop-up flash. Over the years after hundreds (thousands?) of \"POP!\"s from the flash, the screws in question get slowly rattled looser and looser.  Finally, they fall out, but stay contained within the camera.<br /><br />Once I performed that repair, though, everything was fine. I used Loctite on the screws so they'll never fall out again.<br /><br />The motion pictures (low quality video) it takes are, especially by 2008 standards, a complete joke - many (most?) cell phones take better video, now. But I found it handy from time to time. Most recently, I used it to have some woman tell me her contact information so I could send her the pictures I had taken. Far easier than writing it down, you know?  The sound, at least, is pretty impressive, considering.<br /><br />**IN THE END**<br /><br />My camera still works like a champ. I see no reason to upgrade until Sony (or somebody else) essentially re-releases the same camera with updated electronic guts. The physical camera, itself, is just about flawless.<br /><br />I'm the first to rip a product if it sucks, so I figured I'd take a moment to praise this item that has been worth every penny.<br /><br />**FINAL WORD**<br /><br />If you can pick up this camera used and in good condition (especially the Zeiss lens), do it. Get that UV lens/filter I told you about. If nothing else, give it to your teenage aspiring photographer. Let their imaginations run wild with all the cool settings - settings that STILL don't exist on 90% of the cameras being put out today. Enjoy.","I have been having this camera for 5 years and was never disappointed with its fantastic picture quality. It is a really superb camera!","I've this camera since 2001 the cost was 762$.  The camera has been worth every dollar I paid.  Everytime I take pictures and share them with friends they  get really impressed.  I've taken pictures like a pro.  I bought a optional mounted flash and in a enclosed space and pointing the flash to the ceiling I've taken the most vivid pictures I could dream of.  I've captured the most wonderful still moments of a party with incredible detail.  The optical zoom allows me to get a close up of a face from my 6th floor apartment building down to the street.  I've thought of buying a new one just because of obsolence you know! but It's gonna be difficult to find another camera that can give me so much fun.","I have owned the DSC F707 since it became available at Best Buy.  It was more money than I planned to spend but I am sure glad I decided to do so.  I have taken 1000's of pictures and printed them on my printer and I am always amazed at the quality of the prints.  Always used a SLR before so I was leary of this camera but soon found it to be a dream to work with.  It seems I can do almost anything I need to do with this camera and it never lets me down.  I have several 128mb San Disks but I would like to find a couple 256mb or 512mb if they are made for this camera.  Does anyone know where I can get these?  Overall, excellent camera!!","First of all, I've owned this camera for approx. 4 yrs and have had some success in producing quality pictures.  However, within the last year, I purchased the only telephoto lens made for the camera which is quite heavy to say the least. I believe, because of the weight, the lens has caused damage to the camera... partially separating the manual focus cylinder from the body of the camera.<br />I've discussed with Sony and got little satisfaction.  All they will do is refer me to a contracted vendor to repair it at substantial cost since I did not have an extended warranty.<br />HAS ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM, AND IF SO, CAN THEY SHARE WHETHER OR NOT IT EVER GOT RESOLVED?<br /><br />ALSO, MY ACTION SHOTS USUALLY RESULT IN BLURRED IMAGINES.  WHAT CAN BE DONE TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Roger","I've had this camera since 2002 and I really like it.  Still great after all these years.  I've done enough photography to get very positive comments on my artistic shots.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />-Holds a lot of photos<br /><br />-High quality images<br /><br />-Easy to use<br /><br />-Long battery life<br /><br />-New memory cards can be programmed in the camera, handy when on the road and the memory card is corrupted<br /><br />-Great color<br /><br />-Movie features picks up sound nicely, but not background noise<br /><br />Con:<br /><br />-Sometimes wipes out the memory card, losing all photos (recent research on this suggests this is due to sensitivity to hot and cold)<br /><br />Bottom line: a great buy and worth the money.  Also recommend that you buy the Sony memory stick mouse to go with it.","Then this model is the camera for you :)!  I got mine one week before the 717 came out and paid around 800.  The drop in price w/in 30 days got my 110% difference return, so I actually got the camera for around 550!!  I have since taken over 20,000 pictures, both work and home in all formats.  This camera is a work horse!!  I have used both the 707 and 717, and actually prefer this camera because of several small features (such as placement of the zoom button)<br /><br />The focus engine and the Zeiss lens are the main reason to get this camera.  Most of my pictures match what I could do with an SLR.  The one problem I find is reds and purples... don't trust auto focus on these two colors.<br /><br />I see a lot of folks upgrading and getting rid of these cameras and have not seen any that have \"worn out\" yet.  Sony did a great job of engineering with this camera!!!<br /><br />For examples of my pics... you can check here: [...]  Most of the pics were taken with the 707..<br /><br />I would personally value the camera around 350-400, but as they say.... \"The more you pay, the more its worth!!\"<br /><br />Good luck and take lotsa pictures!!<br /><br />Jay","Even though the camera has been out for a couple of years, don't let that make you think it's out of date.  This camera is such a breeze to use that it is a joy to take pictures with.  Having a pivot joint allows you to take pictures that you would have to lay on the ground for otherwise.  The time between pressing the button and the picture being taken is much faster than my old Sony digital camera.  All the buttons are well placed, extremely good ergonomics.  This was a $1200 camera when it first came out for good reason.  It is a must have for anyone looking to take quality pictures and do it with ease.","This is my first camera i ever purchased. It's great! I haven't had any complaints. It shoots great pics, the zoom is phenomenal, and the features are great. Its a quality camera","This Sony takes some awesome photos! I have printed a lot and they are always sharp & clear, this cam has a ton of features and is every bit worth the asking price, so go ahead and plunk down the cash, you won't be dissapointed!","Like most people about to buy a digital camera, I did a lot of research. A lot. When it came down to making a decision about price vs. value, I kept coming back to the 707. It really came down to the incredibly high resolution, the Zeiss lens and the EFT veiwfinder which although not the ideal, it's damn good for an EFT. It also has a very functional diopter adjuster which makes the viewfinder the best in its class. I've been using the camera for about a year now and it's NEVER run our of power. I work at a graphic design firm and my co workers are blown away by my 11x14 prints made from this camera. I still don't see anything that can touch the quality of this camera for the $. You just can't go wrong.","This camera is simply amazing. A long time ago when digital cameras were first starting to appear I plunked down a load of cash for a camera. It stunk. My big issue with them back then was, apart from the image size being too small, the images looked no better than a consumer level video camera. Whites were always blown out and the image looked like what it was - video. So, I went back to shooting mainly 35mm film and scanning that.<br />Due to some unforseen events, I ended up purchasing this camera. I really did not expect it to act any better than the digicams I have previously owned. I am amazed at how well Sony got this thing to behave like my 35mm film cameras! The images even look like they were shot on film. Very crisp, clear, and none of that awful video look. Whites are white and not a single sign of being blown out.<br />I have found that there are times that the colors are not right on if you just shoot in full auto mode, but if you take the time to compose the shot you can get everything perfect.<br />This is definitely not a camera for someone who just wants to take pictures. It is for serious amateur photographers who don't want to spend the massive amounts of cash on something like a Canon D-60.","This is our first digital camera, and we absolutely love it.  It is easy to use, comfortable to hold (Although a wee bit bulky with the long lens), and takes AWESOME pictures.  Many people have commented on the quality of the pictures.  I highly recommend a HITI or equal printer using dye-scan technology for printing.  No other printers will come close, and these pictures look like a postcard!  SONY should provide at least a 64 MB memory, and I highly recommend getting two batteries and two 128MB sticks, and trust me you'll be all set to go!!  Good shooting!","I'm not a professional photographer, I don't pretend to be.  I also am not as technically knowledgeable as some.  What I know is that I can take incredible photo's and I can do so whenever I want.  I have shot with other digital camera owners who all grudgingly agree that Sony makes the best one if only for the super long battery life, this alone makes it worth while.  The 5X optical zoom is to kill for and the Night vision is unparalleled in a camera at this price.  [The price}...might seem like a lot of money but for this camera it is well worth it.  Even for a novice this is easy to use and has stunning results.  I am told the 717 is pretty much the same.","I bought this camera while on cruise in support of Opeation Enduring Freedom.  The harshness of sea and salt in the air with the combination of high humidity is detrimental to most electronic devices.  This camera actually seemed to work better during these conditions at sea and ashore.  I have taken movies (up to 30 min's in length) at night and during day along with pictures.  The resolution is magnificent and there is literally no pixelation on the highest setting.  The only drawback that I can think of is that the camera doesn't come with a case.  Based on the overall ability of this camera, buying the case makes it worthwhile.  Night vision is the best I have seen (even military wise).  I would reccomend this camera to any and all avid camera users.  From beginner to professional...you will find this item will suit your needs!","I spent months trying to decide which 5megapixel camera I was going to buy. I finally decided on the Sony 707 because of the 28-190mm (equivalent)zoom lens by Carl Zeiss. My images are crisp and unbelievably sharp up and down the length of the zoom. Full featured with lots of manual options, I got fantastic shots right out of the box. Although I have shot 35mm film for 25 years, I am giving my 35mm equipment to charity.","I've owned 4 Sony digital cameras, from the FD91, F505V, CD300 to the F707.  This camera is the best of the bunch!  The pictures are clear and sharp, colors vivid and rich.  Macro shots are unbelievable!  This camera has turned me into a semi-pro, enabling me to sell quite a few photos to date.  The camera allows not only automatic shooting, but full manual control.  The addition of the viewfinder (the F505V didn't have one) let's you shoot in very sunny situations without having to jiggle the camera for an LCD view.  The camera is easy to hold and offers the opportunity to swivel the base, allowing for shots you might otherwise miss, like above the heads of a crowd.  The night shot features offer the chance to get shots in total darkness and night shots that would be ruined because of distance or because the flash is too bright.  If you're looking for a digital camera just below a professional model, this one is it!","Prior to owning the Sony DSC-F707, I had a Kodak DC290.  I thought that the Kodak was pretty decent, but after acquiring this camera, I totally abandoned the Kodak.  Not only does this camera have exceptional zoom ability, but it also has a macro for taking close-up's!  In case you wonder about the quality of this camera, just take a close-up of a penny on the side with the Lincoln memorial.  You can even see the statue of Lincoln quite clearly!  It's truly amazing!","I HAD THIS CAMERA FOR OVER A MONTH AND A HALF. AND I SWEAR I HAD SOOO MUCH FUN TAKING PICS WITH IT. ESPECIALLY WITH THE WOMEN! WHEN A WOMAN GETS  PHOTOGRAPHED WITH THIS CAMERA, THEY ARE AMAZED HOW BIG AND CLEAR THE PICS COME OUT. THEN THEY WANT U TO TAKE MORE PICS AND THATS HOW U END UP WITH PHONE NUMBERS! I DID TURN MY CAMERA IN AND BOUGHT THE NEW 717 CAMERA INSTEAD.STILL GET ALOT OF GREAT RESULTS WITH THE WOMEN. ONE FINALLY NOTE.... MAKE SURE U UPDATE YOUR LAPTOP OR DESKTOP TO WINDOW XP BECAUSE U'LL SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN QUALITY AND SIZE OF PICTURES.","I bought this camera a year ago as an upgrade from the P70 because I wanted something with manual focus and a higher resolution.  I've been extremely satisfied with the picture quality, although a slightly faster lens would have made taking indoor pictures easier without the flash.  The image quality is astounding; everyone around me is amazed at what this camera can produce.  5MP is plenty for producing decently-sized prints.<br />The camera works well with every computer I've plugged it into on a range of operating systems (Mac OS 8-X, Windows 98-XP,RedHat Linux 7.x) and shows up as a mounted filesystem that I can easily  drag a drop to/from.  I don't use the included software to edit images, preferring ImageMagick for quick edits or photoshop for more complicated work.<br />I would certainly reccomend this camera for anyone looking for capability beyond the basic point-and-shoot models.  The manual focus and exposure settings are simple and relatively intuitive, and more complicated things like white balancing are properly available.<br />I would reccomend this camera for anyone looking for a digital camera, but still wanting to retain some of the flexibility of a SLR film camera.","I bought this camera 1 year ago and I've been satisfied with its performance, excellent lens, incredible quality of the pictures, althout at first it could be difficult to operate the menu, once you get used to it you will be pleasant with your purchase.","This is my third digital camera with each buy being a step up. This is a great camera that takes great pictures. Some of the great features are the manual controls like focusing and lighting. Another big plus is the Nightframing mode which allows you to use infra red to view and focus on your subject in total darkness and then the flash pops up as you take the picture for a perfect color shot. The Nightshot mode is also pretty neat if you want to take pictures in the dark with infra red like results.<br />Overall this is a great camera with only one negative comment and that being on the red eye reduction feature. Once you press the shutter button you no longer see your subject through the viewfinder/LCD screen because it goes blank for the second or so while the red eye strobing occurs. If you're not careful, this can result in your moving the camera off of the subject during the strobing... or your subject themselves decided to move and you won't know that until after the picture is taken and the viewfinder/LCD picture comes back.<br />I recommend this camera to anyone wanting a great 5M pixel camera at a very reasonable price (compared to others) with exceptional features.","I have never been a fan of Sony's digital cameras. Video cameras were always great but those Mavicas, especially first models with a floppy as a storage, were horrible. Now I have to admit that the Cybershot 707 is a great camera. If you have ever used Minolta Maxxum 5000 or 7000 models you will love Cybershot 707. In Cybershot you have all the goodies that SLRs had. Shutter priority, Aperture priority, full manual mode and much much more. In addition, operating Cybershot is very easy especially if you have ever owned any Sony camcorder. Most menus and setup functions are very intuitive and easy to find even without a manual...","I took this camera on a 10 day trip to Italy and it performed like a champ.  I am continually amazed at the picture quality, both in night and day shots.<br />Just as a primer, I went 10 days straight shooting off around 400mb worth of images per day.  And each day, the lowest my battery ever came was 30 minutes.  At the end of each day, i'd unload the pictures to my laptop and recharge the camera and start all over again the next day.  I intermixed using the LCD display, flash/no flash, etc - and i never worried about the battery power.<br />Honestly, I'm an amateur photographer at best, but the images it produced were amazing - makes you feel much better than you actually are.<br />I even dropped it accidentally, at 3 feet onto concrete and with the exception of a few scratches, it works just like new.<br />It's not all good.  If I had to find some negatives, I'd say, the bulkiness isn't always the best thing.  Having this huge \"L\" shaped camera hanging off your neck can be a bit imposing.  I won't get into that whole propietary argument with the memory sticks - they're afforably priced now and so what if there's five different standards?  The thing with it that I don't like is that 128 mb is the biggest they've got.  At 5mp, at full resolution, it's 51-55 shots max per card.  Sony could do a little better than that.<br />Overall, you get what you pay for with a Sony - superior image quality, unmatched battery life, great features.","I own a graphic design studio, and with DSC F707 we could finish almost all projects without using any other still camera.<br />Picture quality, color quality, exposure measuring, and all other functions work very well. There are other some cool feauters like night vision and night shot, which also work great.<br />This a great still camera that exceeds expectations.","I have several digital cameras, and this one is far and away my favorite.  For the average person (i.e., a non-professional photographer), this is a tremendous instrument.  The 5.2 Mpixel resolution is fantastic, the controls are great and easy to use.  Yes, you still should read the manual - because then you'll get even more out of this camera; but you can start using it pretty much right out of the box.  I would recomend getting a second memory stick with greater capacity - these are HUGE images (over 2 MB per picture) and they'll quickly fill up the small memory stick that comes w/ the camera.  This camera's strength is in the still images; the movie mode is OK, but they're small MPEG images and not nearly as high a resolution as the stills.  I have a separate digital video camera for the motion shots; and this one for the stills.  This really is a great camera.  Its not cheap - but its worth the money if you want to take good shots.","This is the best digital camera.<br />The controls are so easy to operate, and quality of the picture<br />is excellent. The night shoot/frame give you sharpest picture everytime. The battery can use for weeks between charges. If you want the best digital camera, This is the one for you.","My wife and I  each have a 707 and try to go out shooting at least once a week.  I love this camera.  I am going to list a few shortcomings, but trust me this is what technology should be and while our pair of Nikon 6006s have a few advantages over digital, the ease of use and instant gratification carry the day for the 707.<br />It is slow as the dickens, don't expect to have much luck with action shots, this is the only reason the 717 has my attention.  If you do need to shoot action, hit menu and one of the record modes is \"burst 3\" three rapid shots one after another, you might get lucky that way.<br />The \"A\" and \"S\" settings to enhance depth of field and shutter speed do not seem to give good results.  These days I just put it on the green camera icon, that seems to perform the best.<br />Like many digitals it doesn't work so well in intense light situations, if you are going to shoot in snow or at the beach, think about getting the lens hood and ND filter accessories.<br />It also doesn't score a homerrun on subtle transparent sky light, a muted sunset, or rainbow can be lost.  I was shooting a double rainbow over Nawiliwilli harbor, I could see both, it could only see one of them.<br />I wish the buttons on the side of lens were in a deeper indent, I keep hitting buttons like white balance when I do not mean to.<br />The auto popup flash is really noisy and vigorous and it has caused me to miss a few shots as it slams into place.<br />Moving to some of the really positive features:<br />The macro mode for closeups is a marvel.  Kathy, my wife loves shooting bees on flowers and such and it comes through every time.<br />The way it handles light on water is just spectacular.  It can also handle shooting the sky through trees and similar shots that confound simple cameras.<br />The movable lens, and ability to work with finder or lcd screen really gives you flexability when shooting things taller than you are.  I got a Senators Only parking sign on Parliament Hill Ottawa that was about 8' up by holding the camera above my head and aiming through the lcd.<br />The range of the zoom is all you can ask of a single lens, yes you do lose a bit of resolution at full digital zoom, but it can still nail a seaplane landing in Vancouver harbor and has enough pixels left to print a nice 8.5 x 11.<br />It interfaces with both my Mac 10.2 and Windows XP Pro with no problem in either case.  The XP software is actually a bit more efficient than iPhoto.<br />I will close with some final tips:<br />My wife got me this little nylon Ex Officio bag to tie to the strap.  That is a much more efficient in an active shoot than the memory stick wallet.<br />If the subject moves, as soon as you start framing, teach yourself to push the shutter button half way down, that cuts a lot of the delay out of a shot.<br />Don't buy a memory stick less than 128M, I think my wife's 707 came with a 16M, now *that* is funny.<br />If you have never tried one of these web based photo storage and printers like Amazon.com's photo services or Image station, they are great for situations like shooting a family reunion.  Just send the URL to everyone and they can order all the prints they want.  Remember the days of looking for the negative with picture 5 on roll 9?  I love my 707, I am dreaming of a 717, and I am never going back to film.","This is a terrific camera - worth the price. Optics and image quality are quite good, and it carries easily despite it's large lens assembly. Linking with my eMac using Mac OSX (Jaguar) was sooo easy - plug it to the USB port and iPhoto imports the photos with one click! Optional filters seem worth the money - one protects the lens from damage, and the other is a polarizing filter that cuts glare well. Battery life between charges far exceeds my expectations - even when using the red eye reduction flash feature. You'll need at least one128MB memory stick; the provided 16MB stick is worthless if you shoot high resolution. the Lexar memory sticks are less costly and seem to perform well so far.","this is awesome..<br />i liked the design of this camera when i bought it...<br />that's the reason why i bought it..<br />but now.. i like everything.. design, quality & etc..<br />the quality of the pictures is great..<br />have never ever seen it before..","I just received my Sony DSC-F707 Cyber-shot, I going to tell you the truth, it's incredible, it's really easy to use, it's very light, it's just perfect. I will recommend you to buy a Lexar Memory Sticks they work fine and they're cheaper, also buy a memory stick reader, this download photos very quickly and you don't have to plug the camera anymore, just the stick, this will save you battery life.<br />I'm very satisfied with this purchase, if you like to take a lot of photos this camera is worth every penny, trust me!","THis is the camera to get to do all your professional digital shooting.  I know there are better cameras out there but this one offers the most value.  It has all the features I need (automatic lighting correction) and its zoom capability is very useful for sporting events.","I've gone through a lot of Digital and 35mm Camera's, and found this to be the best. (The others were high grade Nikon, Canon, and Olympus cameras...)<br />1. The info lithium batteries last a long time, and charge quickly... Cameras using regular batteries will cost you a fortune, and some only get 10-12 shots per set of batteries. This camera doesn't suffer from lack of power.<br />2. The nightshot nightvision feature is fantastic. Taking shots in the dark are illuminating. :)<br />3. The macro photography features make taking pictures very close a simple task. This is something that most cameras cannot do.<br />4. The quality of the photos are wonderful, and that's what it's all about.","This is my first digital camera. I bought it two months ago while on family vacations and for its value, it is a great camera.A little bit expensive but a lot of picture effects, easy to use and of curse, Sony's trademark, backgrounds quality.","If you are a complete novice when it comes to digital photgraphy (or just plain photography) and if you are looking for a digital camera, look no further. Sony has come up with a product that is virtually idiot-proof.<br />Take me for instance. I couldn't even take a  decent shot before and now I have friends telling me that I have a hidden talent after looking at the shots I took.<br />Basically if you are like me, just point and shoot and let the camera do all the thinking and believe me you will get very sharp shots and the colours that it captures is just incredible.<br />However for those who are more adventurous, there are options that allow you to shoot under different conditions e.g. twillight, portrait & landscape. And for those in the know,  there is the option to adjust the shutter speed and aperture (these being foreign to me and totally beyond my comprehension).<br />I would seriously recommend the product to novices and serious hobbyist but I would think that serious enthusiasts/professional photgraphers will find the product limited.<br />For those of you with Macs bundled with iPhoto, the camera syncs effortlessly with the Mac (again this is idiot-proof as I can humbly attest).<br />All in all, I would give it a 5 star and will continue with fooling others into thinking that I'm \"talented\".","I have been using this camera for about six months now and I am constantly amazed at how good it is.  I never use my film cameras anymore and have ditched my plans to convert one of my rooms into a darkroom.  The 707 takes some getting used to, but you'll find yourself mastering it within a few days.  My only gripes are: (1) burst mode is limited to 3 frames; (2)can't change lens; and (3) memory stick is currently offered in a max capacity of 128 megs.  The camera's strong points are almost too many to list; some of my favorite aspects of the camera are: (1)fantastic Carl Zeiss lens; (2) brilliant LCD; (3) crisp view finder; (4)intuitive controls; (5) highly accurate meter modes; (6) useful built-in flash (quite powerful for a built-in); (7) rapid auto-focus and easy-to-use manual focus ring; and (8) unbelievable battery time.<br />Bottom line:  Worth Every Penny!","I bought this camera in May of 2002 and found that I can take better pictures with it than I could with a film camera.  It has all the major features of a high quality Nikon SLR that I own and still use for slides.  The Zeiss lens is outstanding and has a big aperture, f2.0, impressive for a digital.  On a vacation to Maui recently, I took over 400 pictures, and there ain't a bad one in the bunch.  Maui continues to be a vibrant memory to me through these pictures.<br />Because there is so much published about what this camera has and can do, I will offer only a few tips from my 1000 or so picture-taking experience with this camera.<br />1. Don't try to focus on anything less than 1 meter away.  I had a dickens of a time trying to photograph a small frog one night, with flashlight in one had and camera in the other.  I could get within inches of the rascal, but the camera would not focus even a couple of feet away.  I eventually figured out to go beyond a meter and zoomed in on him and that worked fine.  There is a macro lens mode for anything under 1 foot away, which may have worked if I had thought about it!<br />2. Forget TIFF mode, this takes forever to capture a picture and takes up 15 meg of memory.  The JPEG \"fine\" mode will capture pictures more than adequate to serve 99% of your needs, and you can get hundreds of these on a memory stick.  Now, if you have real need for TIFF, then disregard this comment.<br />3. Get the SONY bag, LCS-FX, made especially for this camera.  You will not regret.  It is a fine and durable leather and the camera fits in there like a hand in glove, and holds and extra stick or two and spare battery.  You will carry the camera with confidence and style in this compact case.  Handy for taking out and putting back in - great for tourists.I got it... because the camera comes with a coupon for Sony extras...The best investment I've made recently.<br />4. Get an extra battery, but don't waste money on a charger.  You can charge your batteries in the camera overnight, and these batteries last a good long time.  This camera's battery life is a true innovation by Sony, unbelievable!<br />5. Don't waste your money on external flashes.  The built in flash has three power settings possible, and is the most powerful flash I've ever had in a camera, even when I've used externals before.<br />6. Get a few extra 128 MB memory sticks for your trips to Hawaii or the far east.  You will be taking hundreds of pictures, so don't be caught short.<br />7. Get the Sony USB memory stick reader for your computer.  You won't have to keep plugging and unplugging your camera in there.  This is like a little disk drive, and I've found it to be incredibly compatible with my computer.<br />8. Get Adobe Photoshop Elements to make corrections to your pictures.  You will spend a lot of money and a lot of time to take your pictures.  This little software package will make very good photos into fantastic photos.  Adjust contrast and brighten those darker than desired faces.  Well worth the hundred bucks to underwrite your investment.<br />9. Learn how to use the Manual, Aperture and Shutter priority modes.  Doing this will allow you to capture sunsets, darker scenes, sporting events, moving objects and anything unusual that automatic mode simply will not do.<br />10.  Get a UV filter for your lens.  This is just a lens protector as the filter itself does virtually nothing.<br />Forget about other lens attachments such as wide angle or telephoto.  I've got these for my old camcorder and I can tell you that these are just clumsy extras you have to lug around and seldom use.  They also degrade picture quality.<br />In short, this camera still amazes and delights me.  It is an amateur photographers dream.<br />Frankly, I don't understand the whining so many reviewers do about the Sony memory stick.  People need to get over their childish bias towards flash cards and smart media. Who cares what other cameras use if you have a Sony?  Sony's memory stick works just fine, and is a highly reliable and compact medium.  Sony is to digital photography as Disney is to entertainment.  They set the standard, and everybody else just tries to copy, change something simple to be \"different\", and keep up.  My recommendation is for those imitators using flash cards and other gimmicks, to get smart, get on board, and start using the industry standard, Sony memory sticks, like the rest of the world.","I have now used the camera for a whole of 3 months and have shot close to 900 pictures and have bought 3 books on photography and digital photography.<br />Not having been an interested photographer in the past, I think that the above fact speaks volumes for how good the camera is and how cost effective it is over film (this is true for most digital cameras) and how interested it can get you to start photographing. I can vouch for this fact because, a friend who picked up another one of these beauties is doing pretty much the same.<br />This camera has an effective 5 Meg pixels and knows how to use them. The pictures are absolutely razor sharp. This does not mean that you cannot take soft portrait. With a lot of manual settings at your disposal you can get the picture just the way you want it.<br />Now, the lens. Oh! What a lens. This is a lens which if various reviews and friends whose hobby is photography are to be believed would cost atleast 2 to 3 grand to get film SLR equivalents. Think about it! You get an aperture of 2.0 at a 5x zoom at full wide angle. That is a really fast lens. To go with it does extremely well in low light conditions as well! The auto focus is not the fastest but for most shots you do not even notice it.<br />Now the controls, full aperture control (from f/2 to f/8) and full shutter control from 1/1000 sec to 30 secs gives you enough freedom to capture the most unusual shots! White balance options are not as expansive though, you get to choose between 3 auto, outdoor or indoor. If none of these are close enough, you have a one-touch white balance. But this requires that you have a white object exposed to the same light that the object you want to photograph is exposed to. Not always feasible for landscapes in tricky light conditions or for people and portraits outside or in mixed lighting. Even though to be fair, the auto does a pretty good job of calculating white balance. Auto Exposure Lock and a choice of 3 metering modes allow you to adjust exposure to any part of the photo and shoot images with consistent exposure. This is very important if you want to stitch landscapes together. Also, you have the option of either manually focussing if need be. Pretty good versatility.<br />Other good stuff: Flash is really very good, night shot framing is very handy, battery performance, etc.,<br />Strengths:<br />1) Carl Ziess lens.<br />2) 5 meg pixels.<br />3) Low light photography.<br />4) Price - Performance ratio.<br />5) Flash<br />6) Battery life and info<br />7) Level of manual controls<br />8) Great tripod mount positioning<br />Weaknesses:<br />1) Choice of memory stick as the only media.(Max 128M)<br />2) Limited white balance options<br />3) No histogram for exposure readouts<br />4) In camera battery charging<br />5) Bundled software<br />6) No hot shoe mount for flash<br />7) Orientation of the telephoto/wide angle zoom control","I can't stop taking pictures. Need more mem sticks.","The Sony F707 is what everyone who grew up with a 35mm SLR has been hoping their first digital camera would be.  The picture quality rivals even the best consumer 35mm SLRs, the feature set is robust and the zoom lens (optical only) is equivalent to a 28mm to 194mm 35mm SLR lens.  (You can turn the digital zoom off, and I do!)<br />Picture quality is excellent, whether shooting sunsets or portraits.  The color saturation and accuracy are astounding.  The robust feature set gives you as much control as you want -- just like any good 35mm SLR.  Full auto or full manual, with everything in between.  A great feature is the easy to use exposure adjustment just above the shutter trigger.  You can adjust your exposure and see the results of the new settings in the view finder or on the LCD before you even take the picture. Finally, the lens not only has an impressive zoom range (28mm to 194mm is, like, perfect!), but is fast as well, with a maximum aperature of f2.2.  Too often zoom lenses with such a wide range suffer from extreme slowness, even at full aperature.  By contrast, I have been amazed at how well this Carl Zeiss lens does in low light situations.<br />Other features include an array of great focusing systems, including infrared in low light and 'night vision' focus for shooting in the dark; the ability to lock focus on your target when surrounded by competing auto-focus possibilities; the shutter sound that the camera makes (digitally reproduced, of course); the swivel body that allows you to shoot level while holding the camera over your head - and still see your subject on the LCD screen - or shoot from the waist looking down onto the now-tilted-up LCD screen; the various burst modes; the easy-to-use menu system; and so on... All add up to making the F707 a treat for the photo enthusiast.<br />Personally, I wish Sony would have given the F707 more white balance pre-sets and a black and white option rather than the solarization and sepia options the camera offers.  And I find the placement of the zoom buttons on the lens an awkward arrangement; one I have yet to get used to.  But these are minor complaints.<br />In addition to the F707, I also have a Sony VAIO Digital Studio PC with a Memory Stick drive, so using Sony's Memory Stick media is a breeze for me.  I also have a MindStor portable hard drive with Memory Stick adaptor for storing thousands of 5MP photos while in the field.  This way I get by with having only 4 128MB Memory Sticks.  The MindStor has a rechargeable battery so if I'm really cranking the shots I can download the Sticks right in the bush and keep right on shooting.<br />Finally, a word about the battery.  Sony has long been a leader in lithium ion batteries and the InfoLithium line that the F707 uses is the best of their best!  It truly does last longer than other comparably sized Li Ion batteries, and the fuel gauge is a very useful and much appreciated bonus.  I have three batteries and have yet to find myself wishing I had a fourth.<br />For accessories I added the Sony cold-shoe flash (it's connected to the camera by a cord).  It does a nice job of providing easy-to-use bounce flash, and with the offset extension, eliminates red eye naturally, without distracting multiple flashes.  I also use my full range of Cokin filters that I have from my 35mm SLR days.  All I needed to do was buy the correct-size lens ring for the Cokin filter holder.<br />If you want a camera that gives you all the convenience and flexibility of a high-end digital camera, while at the same time feeling and acting like a 35mm SLR, the Sony F707 is the camera for you.  If you want exceptional picture quality, a quick and precise auto focus system, and exposure control at your fingertips, this is the camera for you.  If you have a thousand bucks to spend on a camera you will love, then buy the Sony F707 and get on with the picture taking!  You won't even miss your 35mm SLR.","This camera is affectionately known to it's biggest fans as the Dark Angel.  I spent many months researching for my first digital camera purchase, and settled on the 707.  In the first few months of manufacturing, a lot of customers found some pretty major \"syndromes\" such as Dark Left Side Syndrome and Blue Flash Syndrome - but my 707 (manufactured in January 01) is flawless.<br />The only thing that is keeping me from having more fun with this camera is my lack of free time.","This is my fourth digital camera...and by far the best..it was expensive..especially here in canada..but its worth it..<br />I was never impressed with sunset shots with other digitals..they just never caught the scene quite right...one of the first pictures I took with the f707 was of a sunset..and it was deadly..perfect..It was just like looking at the real thing..<br />Excellent camera..luckily I also have a sony digital movie camera and the batteries are the same..so very handy..<br />VERY pleased with the camera...","I SHOPPED FOR 6 MONTHS BEFORE I MADE THE DECISION TO BUY. I LOOKED AT EVERYTHING OUT THERE. THE F707 HAS MEET ALL MY EXPECTIONS. THE 5 MEGAPIXELS IS GREAT FOR CROPPING ON THE PRINTING SIDE, ALTHOUGH THE ZOOM LENS TAKES CARE OF A LOT OF THAT. THE ADJUSTABLE LIGHT METER IS ALMOST SCI FI WITH A PRESS OF A BUTTON YOU CAN CHANGE HOW THE CAMERA ADJUSTS FOR LIGHT EXPOSURE. SIZE IS NOT A PROBLEM SMALLER THAN YOU THINK. THE IMAGES ARE SO CLEAR I PRINT TO 8X10 AND ITS UNBELIVABLE. WELL WORTH THE $1000 BUCKS.","I have always loved to take pictures and have been longing for a digital camera for quite a while.  I spent months upon months researching and saving money (as I am only 17, and have only a part-time job) and this was the highest-rated one I could find (and it is a Sony which also helped along my decision; Sony products are the best.)  Well, I got the money together and purchased this.  I can honestly say it is the BEST thing I ever invested money in.  It takes such vivid photographs and captures every little detail.  If you are looking for a camera, whether you're a beginner or an expert, GET THIS ONE!!! You will not be disappointed.  I also recommend a Sony 128 MB Memory Stick, as you will not be able to stop taking pictures!","As someone who was always interested in photography but couldn't justify endless trips for 1-hour photo processing, digital photography was the only way to go for me.<br />The F-707 is the first digital camera I've owned and I've been very happy with it. I will say that low-light (for any CCD) can be a challenge, with longer exposure times in low-light needed for good prints, but a tripod solves the problem for stationary subjects. I've taken some long-exposure night photos and have been really impressed with the results: no noise whatsoever!<br />Since I'm certainly not an expert nor a reviewer of electronics in general, I can't tell you how this camera stacks up against the competition. But on its own I've found no glaring shortcomings with it bar one well-reported one, and that is that it exhibits some \"barrel distortion\" when taking pictures at minimum zoom.<br />I also purchased the wide angle conversion lense, which, while bulky, definitely has it's place and has allowed me to take some dramatic photos I'd otherwise have been unable to.<br />Hope this helps.","...My husband bought me this Sony DSC-F707 for Mother's Day.  I was skeptical.  But after using it, I really enjoy it.  You can adjust the shutter speed, apature settings, ect.  This camera feels just right.  The night shot works really well.  It is easy to use, you can take fairly decent action shots and not miss what you were shooting at.  The quality is fantastic.  I recommend the 128 mb memory stick.  You can take up to 1545 pictures with the 1280 resolution.  Which is a lot of pictures.  The print quality at that resolution is great.  A must for avid 35mm fans.","I bought this camera,and it's is the best investment I ever made so far on camera's. This camera is loaded with features, easy to use and replay your pictures in a click,and memory can hold lot of pictures. I would recommend this to every person. If you want to own digital camera the buy SONY DSC-F707. You will be proud to own it!","I wrote a review about a month after we bought the F707.  Now, after an additional 5 months of use, I still love it and have learned more about it:<br />A high res jpeg will consume about 2.5 MB or memory space.<br />The Sony battery is expensive but has good life and the charging system is very smart.<br />Be patient when using the manual focus.  The zoom setting varies as you manually focus.<br />You need fairly good light and contrast for the macro mode autofocus to work properly.<br />Force the fill flash when working indoors under fluorescent light and you'll get better color balance.<br />In low light, I use the LCD screen to compose.  Under normal circumstances, I use the eyepiece to save on battery life.<br />I do wish it was easy to delete all images on the chip simultaneously, but haven't found a way to do so.<br />...  This really is a great quality tool.  I love it.  We've been getting great images.  The shutter response is faster than most digital cameras, a real plus.","I originally bought the Nikon 5000 after owning a 2 megapixel Kodak DC290. Unfortunately (but fortunate in a way), this camera was stolen. I was dissapointed wtih it from the start. The colors were nowhere near as vibrant and clear as the Kodak DC290. I often found outdoor pictures to be yellow saturated and distant objects to be far from clear especially if they are bright like a snow capped mountain. Indoor pictures were terrible, colors were way off and half the time the light sensor did not sense correctly leading to half the pictures being blurry. The optics are also a joke and the menu options far from intuitive. Now the Sony F707, on the other hand, brings back the beautiful clear vibrant pictures of my Kodak DC290 and much more. For starters, the F707 is noticeably more solidly built. The menu system is far more intuitive than the nikon. I didn't have to read any of the manual to start playing around with advanced features. The optics are awesome blowing away the Nikon. Indoor pictures are crisp and clear and can be taken faster than the Nikon which has a terrible lag in low light. And the battery is phenomenal (dont even think about buying the Minolta Dimage7 just based on the battery life). To me, this is the only competitive 5 MP Digital on the market.","While its obvious that this camera takes outstanding quality shots I would like to focus on 2 disappointments:<br />1. The MGI PhotoSuite 8.1 software is not a suite at all. More like a 1991 watered down MS paint... On top of that the MGI VideoWave III SE software isn't even compatible with Windows XP. There was a long list of compatibility problems on ... Save me the $... they charge for this junk.<br />2. The 16MB Memory stick is an insult. ... Is this how you got the camera under ...? I had to dish out another $... to get a 128MB stick. I would have rather not had the 16MB stick included and paid $... less.<br />I understand the whole marketing point of accessories but when you're buying a $... camera the above listed items are absolutely unacceptable. The price should be more around $... and leave out the software and stick.<br />Other than that the camera is excellent!","Did my homework on dp review dot com and everything indicated picture quality surpassed anything else currently on the market, especially in this...price range. I have not been disappointed: this camera is definitely worth the money. Resolution is excellent to 11\"x17\" prints (1400 dpi inkjet outputs here) or so. It's outstanding for general use and great for design prototypes or ideas before committing to a photo shoot, documentation, etc. The manual focus and controls are intuitive and the camera, while bulkier than the some ultra compact digital cameras, is very very easy to handle. Batteries last a LONG time, especially if you don't use the flash (I don't). You'll need 128 MB memory sticks: I recommend 4, and also suggest a spare battery, case, uv filter, and card reader. For less than [money] you can do all your web work, very small scale print, and all your personal photog. Because film is so expensive I never had as much fun as I am with this camera. Definitely one of the best purchases in hardware I've ever made.","I own this marvelous camera, bought new at Fry's in northern California.  It is a true marvel, not to be soon obsoleted. It's has the capability of shooting in absolute darkness, with its built in laser!  I also have the wide-angle lens attachment - expensive but worth it to me. The only drawback is that when the very large wide-angle lens is attached, it partially blocks the built-in flash. so either shoot wide angle stuff with available light or external lighting or flash. In good light, images are super sharp!  Gene Deitch, Prague","I have been using this camera for two weeks now and cannot say enough of good words about it. The picture quality is simply amazing even when using automatic. The feature array is unmatched. I especially came to like the NightShot and NightFraming features that allow me to take clear pictures in complete darkness. I cannot think of anything I would like to see improved and added. Great camera for good price","Wow! That's how I felt when I got one of these in my hands. The look and feel is a bit different but becomes very natural very quickly. Don't let that deter you from looking closely at this camera, its output is tremendous and is top rated by almost all reviewers and is on all the recommended lists I've found.<br />For starters, this is my 4th digital camera, my last being the highly rated Kodak DC4800.  What this brings to the party is more pixels (more pixels = higher quality output), a longer optical zoom (digital zoom is practically useless) and low light capability.  Oh, and it also has an unbelievable Carl Ziess-built lens system that is optically superior to most others out there.  Did I mention the quality output? I was extremely happy with my Kodak but this one beats it hands down for any indoor and/or low light scenes.  The color saturation is on the high side (which is what I like anyway) and isn't adjustable in-camera.  There is a sharpness setting and I found this camera likes a +1 setting as the standard setting is just a bit too soft for my tastes. The end output matches the true SLR professional cameras that are out there (digital), and even beats some of the old \"pro\" digitals.<br />But I haven't got to my favorite gain with this camera. Specifically, I've always grieved over digital cameras poor performance in low light. I've tried most every brand out there and found they all lack in this scenario.  Sony addressed this by taking some of their electronic wizardry from their broadcast and consumer video camera world and adapting it for a \"still\" camera. It has Night Shot and Night Framing capability and delivers low digital noise on the final product to boot! This is the answer I've been waiting for!<br />On the downside, EVF's (electronic as opposed to glass view finders) aren't perfect yet. Sony has done a good job here but it still can't fully match SLR capability, except for one exception; it can actually lighten (enhance) detail in very dark scenes that the naked eye can't even see.  It's also a bit hard to store and carry due to the HUGE lens system. Don't get me wrong, for what this camera delivers, I'm willing to adapt to the size and weight. Also, although not difficult to learn what all those buttons do, you'll still need to refer to the owners manual for a while until you memorize all the features.<br />If you're not sure about this camera, my opinion is that if you splurge, you won't be sorry. Yes there are similar and smaller cameras on the market with better memory cards (read larger), but Sony has a real winner here and I'm glad I looked beyond some of Sony's quirkiness with using proprietary batteries and memory! I'm one happy owner...I love this camera!","I owned the DSC F505V before I bought the 707.  The improvements are exactly what the doctor ordered.  Through the lens composition for starters, but still has a very excellent LCD screen, actually better.  The memory stick writes very fast and the picture quality is phenominal.  You can spend a lot more on a digital camera, but why would you want to. The ergonomic layout is much improved with the zoom control on the barrel away from the on off switch.  The price is a bargain and digital is the only way to fly.  Poor Kodak, what will they do with all that film.","We bought this camera planning to start a new hobby.  My wife and I are absolutely satisfied with it's performance.  We will probably never outgrow this camera's capabilities.  Although this is a pretty expensive camera that provides more megapixels than most consumers will ever need, it's a great and powerful camera.  Easy to figure out and use.","I am just writing in to add my vote and endorse this camera.  I've used a number of different cameras, did a huge amount of research, and even with all of the hype surrounding this one, my expectations have been surpassed already.  I am just thrilled with it, despite the not insignificant cash outlay.<br />Headline observations are:  absolutely clear and crisp 8x11 prints from point-and-shoot photos;  very user friendly;  love the video clip capability for emails; robust battery; great variety of options.<br />Main tip:  get at least one additional 128 MB memory stick.  (other accessories I added:  filter to protect lens [price], additional battery [price], and a padded case).<br />I would recommend this camera to anyone from a semi-professional, to an amateur who really enjoys quality photos.","This is my first digital camera and I did months of research and comparison shopping before making a decision. The main alternatives were the Canon G2 and Nikon Coolpix 5000. I've had the camera several weeks now and frankly am still learning all it's features, but at this point I am extremely satisfied. The pictures even on auto pilot have all been spectacular. The magnesium alloy construction has a solid and substantial feel. Battery life is phenomenal. The 5x zoom is great. I love the body/lens swivel feature as well as the option of either LCD monitor or electronic viewfinder for strong sun situations. The settings alternatives and layout is complicated but well designed and more intuitive than other cameras I considered. Color saturation is a bit strong and photos tend to look like a Benetton print ad, but personally I like it. You do HAVE to get the 128 meg memory stick, but the price for those has just been lowered so shop around online for the best deal. Forgot to mention the WOW factor. Everyone who sees it wanders over and has to ask questions and express some oohs and ahs.","I have had this camera close to two months (got it on 12/25/01). And by far this is the best camera I ever owned. The 5.24 Megapixles are amazeing! ... I am a professional phototographer and this out does the $3,000 dollar SLR cameras!!! The zoom, focus, quality, USB, everthing about this camera is top-of-the-line! Trust me I know what im talking about. This camera is worth every penny! You cant go wrong with Sony, there going to stay in business longer then im alive, I see no reason not to buy this camera. I have a Epson 785 photo printer that prints at 2,880 dpi and with the DSC-F707 you can create the most professional looking photos! The quality of the camera is absoutly outstanding and the Memory Stick System is GREAT! Keep it up Sony!","We have been using Sony digital cameras since the first Mavaca floppy disk camera (640x480 image size.)<br />No question, film was superior, but the price per shot (no processing or prints) couldn't be beat. We started putting all the photos on our website, no need to scan, they were already .jpg images. A few people started visiting the site, and even wrote asking what camera we used.<br />Over the years, we upgraded, more and more people visited our site, and the cameras took larger and larger pictures.<br />The 707 is, at this writing, the top of the Sony line, producing huge 2600 X 1900 (i think) images. The image quality compares favoribly to high speed 35MM film, in large blowups it is still less sharp than 100-speed.<br />The battery is much improved, with longer life, and a new fast charger makes it easy to keep the power ready.<br />Be sure to buy two extra batteries and some memory sticks. At full size and quality, a 128 MEG memory stick holds about 57 images.<br /><br />We have posted unedited photos from our first trip on our website....<br />(this camera has since been replaced by the SONY DSCf-828. same great design refined.)","Whether you're just taking pictures of the family or an amature photographer or an artist, this camera performs well. Great resoltion, great color (very slightly oversaturated reds, but the least oversaturated out of most cameras in its class and easily fixed in Photoshop). An amazing value for the thousand that you spend considering it can shoot like some two thousand+ dollar cameras. A must for any artist, graphics designer or amature photographer, even for someone who wants to get introduced into the world of good digital photography. It's not as hard to use as it looks.","I've read some of the excellent reviews of the Sony DSC F-707 and I must say that as a recent buyer of the 707...I agree.  This camera is easy to use and it takes awesome pictures.  As an amateur photographer, what more could you want in a camera?<br />I extensively researched this purchase and found a great website for you to compare specs.  Check the forums out on this site and find out what owners of various cameras say about their purchases.  The Nikon Coolpix 5000 came out at the time of my purchase, but the 707 is totally superior in almost every area (according to reviews posted at the above site).  Don't worry about the white balance bug in early 707's, the new models have been fixed.  If you're comparing the Sony 707 to the Nikon Coolpix or Minolta Dimage you'll get plenty of side by side comparisons at the above site.<br />OK...here's what I love about the Sony DSC F-707.  1) Memory Stick prices have come down and are now comparable to other brands of memory. 2) With 5.0 +/- megapixels YOU have the choice of how detailed you want the resolution.  I use lower resolutions for candid family shots and higher settings for my \"Art-y\" pictures. 3)Many professional photographers are stuck on the Nikon or Canon brand names and don't take the Sony seriously.  Believe it...Sony has rocked the world of digital photography with the F-707...it IS that good.  4)  Even my wife, who is seriously technically impaired, uses this camera many times a week.  5)  Say goodbye to the hassle of loading film...FOREVER.<br />You've heard the pros, now here comes the cons.  1)You should buy an extra battery for long trips or at least remember to take your recharging cords with you.  2) The shape of this camera does take some getting used to, but it's not a problem with use.  3)  I agree with the reviewer who stated that the Zoom button feels backward...I'm still working on this.<br />All in all...we love this camera.","and that about says it all. Except for the pricing on the memory sticks (OUCH!), it's a bargain at a thousand bucks. This has to be the finest digital camera on the market. Incredible resolution, manual focussing, choice of format, hell, it even shoots decent .mpg files!<br />One bit of advice; go for the big memory sticks. You'll want them. Downloading is fast and easy using USB, you can edit and crop shots IN THE CAMERA - and it's easy to operate. Sony has really done it  - and HOW!","I spent months reseaching digital cameras.  I am an average photographer, but love to capture great pictures of my family.<br />I was looking for both quality and easy in use of a camera.  We have been very happy with Sony products in the past and feel that they are worth the cost.  After all the research on the internet and speaking with everyone I could find that knew anything about digital cameras, I decided on the Sony DCS-F707. It took some convincing of my husband because the price was certainly not in the budget!  But after puchasing it however, I have had a tough time getting it out of my husbands hands. He loves it. It offers both automatic and manuel settings (for the more knowledgible).  When comparing photos of a family vaction, our photos at 5 megapixels were far clearer than those of relatives 3.1 megapixel pictures.  We know have our beautiful vacation pictures stored on a CD.","I've been doing digital photography professionally for 8 years now, and I have relatively stringent standards.  As a high end consumer camera, the DSC-F707 rates at the top.  Given adequate illumination, the 707 will produce very sharp images, capable of being printed up to about 14\" on the long axis.  Of perhaps more utility, one can digitally crop images from the 707, for example tossing out 75% of the image and still enlarge to, say 4 x 6\" and get a very good quality print.<br />The camera has a variety of operating modes (such as shutter priority) to allow the user to optimize the exposure for a specific situation.  Exposure compensation is also available and easy to use.  The optics are made by Zeiss, one of the leaders in professional optics.  The combination of large image size, exposure flexibility and excellent quality of optical elements allows one to bring out finer contrast elements in their photos.  You may think that ~1,000 dollars is pricey, but to go beyond what this camera offers, be prepared to spend quite a bit more.<br />Now, to the minor nits that must be picked.  Like most consumer digital cameras, this model does not provide wide angle capabilities ( I think 38 or 39mm as a 35mm equivalent is the widest).  Sony offers screw-on wide angle and telephoto adapters, but I can't find anyone local that stocks them so I can check them out before purchasing.  In most cases, the screw-on wide angle lenses do not couple well with the camera flash, but I have not evaluated this rig with an adapter yet.  And, about the flash on the 707 - it is a flip-up device that pops up when the camera decides that it needs a flash.  This can be distracting.  Also, realize that working with large images can be tedious.  You need more memory stick capacity, a computer capable of manipulating large images quickly and you need to be able to archive huge quantities of data.<br />By the way, this camera has some video capability, but I haven't piddled with it enough to know much about it.  You must use the Sony battery with this camera, so you probably want to have a spare, which will run you another 60 bucks.","In reading the other reviews, they've captured all the technical aspects of this camera. The pictures are very clear and if you've owned another digital camera, it's pretty easy to figure out how to use this one. The features almost seem to be limitless. I purchased this camera at Circuit City and got a GREAT price. Trust me, it's well worth the extra couple hundred dollars because you won't need to upgrade and you won't be disatisfied with the pictures. I owned a Cannon S110 and it took good pictures, but this doesn't even compare. I can't wait to hit Bermuda with this camera!!!<br />To save yourself some hassel, make sure you use a reputable company. A lot of the on-line stores give you these unbelievable deals. Just remember if it's too good to be true, it's too good to be true. They have you call in to confirm the sale and won't sale you the product at the advertised price unless you purchase overpriced accessories.  Be careful, when I didn't get the accessories on one site (US1Digital.com), they told me they would send me an off market version of this camera with the instructions in Japanese. Be careful!!!!","I owned the Sony DSC-S50 for about 2 years.. loved it.. I bought this one around Christmas and I LOVE it!  Once you get into printing your own pictures this is a must!  The difference in resolution is Wonderful!  These pictures come out sooo much better than the 2.1mp ones.  I love all the features and the ability to hook up wide angle and close-up lenses is great!  If you're looking for a great camera that is easy to use.. grab this one!","But regular Nikon SLR 35mm is better anyway.<br />So, if you need digital I'd go with F707, but if you have options to use 35mm I would chose 35mm","I purchased the dsc707 before xmas along with the various filters. The pics that I took at Xmas were beyond my expectations. This is my fourth digital camera, my first Sony, and from the results that I have had, I will be purchasing Sony in the future. The ease of operation, quick downloading via usb, and the quality of the pics makes this the best digital camera purchase on the market not only for the professional but for the home photographer such as I. I highly recommend this camera.","This camera meets all my expectations, and more.  It is easy to use, easy to learn, and provides as much manual compensation as most camera junkies can use.  The rotating body easily allows the camera to be held in an overhead position or in a low, Hasselblad-like style.<br />The pictures are very detailed and the color rendition is exceptional.  I use Adobe Photoshop to tone down the red a little in some pictures - but it's so easy.<br />The driver software, for seeing the camera as a hard drive, installed easily on my PC (WIN 98) and works like a charm.<br />The only reason I will keep my Nikon is for the far ends of the photographic spectrum - very high speed or very long exposures.  It is a little hard to capture exactly the right moment in fast action.  I have not yet tried the multiple frame shots to see if that helps.","I have had the Sony F505 for a year now.  I know of no camera that can match the quality of the photos it takes. It uses a 3.2 megapixel array but only employs a maximum of 2.7 of the available megapixels. I believe the quality of the photos is due to the Zeiss lens and to a superior A-to-D conversion process. My only gripe with the camera is its lack of a viewfinder (only needed for bright sunlight).  This apparently has been corrected in the new F707 model.  The 5 megapixels that the F707 sports is almost overkill.  The F505 will be my last camera (until the infrared camera that can see through clothing hits the market).","Although this camera is at the top of my wish list (digital camera wise), I will not shell out a dime until Sony choses to except the standard provided by compact flash.  Today, a 128mb compact flash costs $39 (512mb is in the $250 range) with the  Smartcards only slightly more.  Sony is now promoting a \"drastic\" price reduction on their cards.......$130 for a 128mb.  I beleive I'll wait and see what happens.<br />My would-be rating of 5 stars is knocked down to 3 due to the previous fact.","I've been in photography for over 20 years and was waiting for the right time to enter into digital format. Now after reading many articles and hearing opinons on the success of digital imaging I took a chance. And what luck to choose the Sony DSC F707 cybershot.<br />I am fascinated, overwelmed and most of all extremely pleased. It does require the most up-to-date computer platform along with quality printer and premium paper to really show its true abilities. I'm hooked now and its only the begining of my digital growth.","The pictures that come out of this camera are of superb clarity.  Easy to use.  Great for recording small MPEG clips to email to family and friends.  Get the custom leather case to venture out of the house with this camera.","The image quality of the F707 is amazing. In this respect, the F707 exceeds low-end SLRs like the Olympus E-10, and is only matched by digital cameras costing over $3000.<br />My only criticism is that the F707 looks and feels more like a digital consumer device than a professional camera. So far, I have been working with a Canon-A1, a traditional film camera. The A1, manufactured over 20 years ago, is a testament to the legendary craftsmanship with which professional film cameras are built. By contrast, Sony designed the F707 like a digital toy. The camera has little girth, and the annoying, obtuse LCD viewfinder makes one yearn for an SLR. When you're holding the F707, you feel like a yuppie with a palm-sized camcorder, not someone well-versed in photography.<br />These are but trifles, though. What matters are the pictures, which the F707 delivers beautifully.","I looked at every digital camera imaginable. The Minolta Dimage 7 costs more and burns batteries like wildfire. The Nikon Coolpix 5000 costs more and doesn't have a good zoom and has several glitches and bugs. This camera has everything at a lower price and also takes pictures that are as good or better than all the other similar cameras.  It also has the battery and adapter included! The only thing missing is the use of cds to store the images on like the other Sony's have. You'd think that would've been included since this one takes larger photos...but this is still an unbeatable camera. It takes photos in quality comparable to the top of the line Nikon digital cameras (the professional models). You can't go wrong with this camera.","This digital camera has the best features and resolution (...). I looked at the Olympus models, but the DSC-F707 has a better resolution than the E-10.(...) The lens is great, and it takes great pictures in low light situations.<br />There is a problem with the white balance on some of these cameras, but I believe it has been fixed. If you find that you are having problems while taking low light pictures, with a flash, you can get a flash upgrade for the camera from Sony. You may have some trouble getting into customer support, but that is my only issue with Sony.<br />Don't let that stop you from getting this camera. The quality is phenomenal. I am a photographer, and you can't find a better camera for the price. The quality rivals an SLR film camera. I can get a 6.4\" by 8.5\" picture at 300 DPI picture out of the DSC-F707. For Graphic Designers, that is not quite magazine quality, but it's getting close. This camera can be used for a lot of professional work, and I am looking forward to using it in the field.<br />I have one more problem with this camera. The 16mb card that comes with it is useless. You'll have to get a 128mb card if you're going to take pictures at the highest resolution. The 16mb card gives you only 6 pictures!!!! The 128mb card gives you 48 pictures. I have two of them, but will need more if I go on a long hike. It depends on what you use it for. (...) The battery seems to be OK. It doesn't go out as fast as other cameras I've had, but it can always get better. If I were you, I'd get this camera, a 128mb memory stick, and an extra battery. Then, you'll be set. (...)<br />All in all, this is a fantastic camera. Other than a few minor quirks, it will make you very happy until the new model comes out. Buy it!","The clarity is fantastic,professional looking.Very easy to use and will turn the casual photographer into a complete enthusiast.I sold my Mavica and bought this as soon as it came out and it's the best purchase I've ever been pleased with.Enjoy.","I'll keep it short... This camera rocks!!!<br />The picture quality is incredible!<br />Don't hesitate, you won't be sorry you purchased this one.","i am very pleased with the results from this camera. The nightvision is awesome, and the color clarity is second to none. I cannot see myself buying another camera for a long time to come.","My previous camera was a Sony DSC-505V. An excellent camera. I am agoldsmith and gemcutter and use a digital camera to photgraph my work for use in portfolio and advertising items for sale. It is some of the most difficult photography there is. But with this camera it has become. I am finished with hiring a professional photgrapher.<br />  Most of my work is done in macro mode. The DSC-F707 is incredible in this way. Focus is always perfect. Just as important is true to life color. When photographing gemstones the color must be exact. Big problem with other cameras that I have used. No problem now. White balance and spot metering are much better than expected and the automatic functions are flawless. In the past I would have to take a dozen photos of each item and then pick the best. I get the perfect shot first time almost always with this camera.<br />  The 5 megapixels is a dream come true. I can take a close up photo of a diamond or gemstone, then crop out an inclusion and enlarge it while still keeping a nice, sharp picture. My customers know exactly what they are getting. It is almost like photography through a microscope. I plugged the camera into a 57 inch digital television and enlarged a small diamond inclusion to fill up almost all of the screen and still had a sharp image. That had me convinved.<br />  Of course this camera will be used for vacations and such also. I am a skydiver and travel all around the country looking for fun. Its common to see the small digital camcorders mounted on helmets. They will get kicked and banged around in the air and get hit with wind up to 300 mph. You will rarely see anything but a Sony mounted on a helmet. It is about the only brand that makes a camera that will stand up to the abuse. So Sony is the only choice.<br />  On skydiving trips the fun does not end when the sun goes down. Take lots of photos after dark. The nightframe feature will see lots of use. In low light conditions the LCD screen on digital cameras is usually black and you have no idea what is in the frame. With the nightframe you can set up the shot under night vision then take photo in true color with the flash. Great feature.<br />  The viewfinder is a great feature lacking in the DSC-505V. In bright light the view screens on digital camera become invisible. With the viewfinder it is easy to see what you are photographing.<br />  This camera has every feature and adjustment that I have seen on any 35mm or digital camera. With a good printer the prints surpass anything that a 35mm can do. 35mm just became obsolete. The included 16MB memory stick is useless. Have to get a 128MB. Also bought the optional wide angle lens. Only complaint is that I have not yet been able to find a wide angle converter lens yet.","I owned a Sony DSC F505 2.1mp camera for past 2 years of which I really liked [which had no viewfinder but the LCD to set up the shot with]. Taken 10,000 + images w/it. Now I have the Sony DSC F707 w/view finder [much nicer to use over LCD]… Battery life was not that good w/F505, but I have not use up a battery on the F707 model even after 4 hours of shooting [turning it on and off between shots] in temps as low as 0*f/-18*c temps. I bought a 2nd battery, [have not needed it yet] but good idea to have in case you forget or do not have the time to charge the one in camera. The only thing I do dislike about it is the fact you have to charge the battery while it is in camera [F505 had separate charger].  A separate charger is an optional accessory w/F707… This is a full function camera compared to the F505. It has a lot of new features on it that I'm still learning about… After having it for 2 weeks now Im glad I bought it, was going to wait and get it next spring. This is an outstanding camera for the money. If you buy it, makes sure to get a few 128mb memory sticks. You will need it if you shot in large format images [on average 2mb+ jpg files]... One of the best things I like about the F505 and F707 is the form-factor, were the lens rotates up/down on the body. Has come in handy many times the past few years w/F505 and they have kept it w/F707 [if you really want a shot close to the ground from ground level or over a fence/people/etc., this camera can do it by using the LCD.  As far as pictures, the F707 takes outstanding image in most lighting. I shot a lot of images w/snow in background, does not seem to effect it in normal mode. (...)","I'm really not a photographer, so I probably shouldn't even be owning this camera.  But after researching everything I could get my hands on, I decided that this camera was uniquely suited to handle pretty much any setting I wanted to throw at it.<br />I've had the camera for about a week now and I couldn't be happier.  The automatic settings yield fantastic results, and the manual settings are simple, yet provide me with complete control.<br />Some of the F707's have a problem with the white balance which makes some pictures turn out bluish in color.  Mine has this, but Sony is providing a free firmware fix.  I have to send it in, but this really isn't a problem.  I had read about this before purchasing it.<br />If I had to pick a downside, it would be the memory stick.  I wish Sony would abandon this and go after compact flash or something like that.  The supplied 16mb stick will immediately need a much larger companion in the camera bag.<br />All in all, though, this is the perfect camera.","Frankly, this IS an investment...you spending $1000+ for this camera plus some needed accessories.  Few people will ever shoot 5 Mega Pixels (MP) shots every time, but serious (and serious amateur) photographers will certainly appreciate being able to produce stunning detail when the need arises.  Look at images shot on your friends' 2 or 3 MP cameras...this level of quality is amazing...but you WILL want to exceed this occasionally, and (...) is the price you pay to get the technology NOW.  A 5 MP head shot will allow you to EASILY discern individual hairs on life-size prints (as in 11x14)...it's truely amazing.<br />I looked at the Minolta Dimage 7...the auto focus zooms past the subject and back...it seems irritatiingly \"loose\", for lack of a better term.  The Sony is a bit crisper in it's approach to auto focus, though not perfect.<br />Low-light shots are a challenge, but the viewfinder does have a tremendous amount of information available, including exposure \"F\" stops, shutter speed, low light warnings, etc.  The true genius is that you can essentially operate the camera in a manual mode, quickly overriding the meter to compensate for the light in any situation...backlight, contrasty light, reflections, etc.<br />If you ever used a 35mm in manual in the old days (when you really had to KNOW photography), you'll love the control available.  And younger photographers will find a whole new world in being able to make this camera do what most digitals will still not do...take the unusual shot.<br />The camera is well balanced, and rather sturdy.  You will get used to the shooting position...give it time.  My biggest complaint is that the zoom selection switch operates \"backwards\" to my taste.  Intuitively, I want to zoom \"in\" pressing the \"out\" button (!)...<br />You have an adequate built-in pop-up flash...PLUS a PC connection for external flash AND a flash shoe!  Slavery, anyone?<br />The memory stick is a bit of a hassle, but extremely convenient once you get over the struggle.  Buy a small USB reader to use at work or home...I use the \"Zio\".  And buy the 128 MB memory stick...nothing smaller.<br />There were early problems with \"White Balance\", as recently as Nov 01.  Current cameras should be shipping with the factory fix, but Sony, to it's shame, STILL has no information on it's website detailing same, even though it required early owners to send the camera for a \"free\" repair.  Not exactly good thinking for a $1000 camera.<br />The images are good, but I do have to compensate a bit in low-light.  Based on shooting several thousand \"test\" shots with another camera, I'm happy with this one.  It does the job and can satisfy both consumer and professional.  Note that I do not plan to replace this camera for several years. Why?  Because printer technology has not caught up to the resolution of the camera (at least for the home user) and no one really needs much more in a camera.  Five Mega Pixels will generate a poster-size image with very nice quality...you won't be doing it often, but you'll be glad you did when you do.<br />I like it, and I shopped hard to ensure the most features with the best price. As with all electronics, find a cheap extended warranty.  (...) .  Cameras DO break.<br />Shop carefully for a CASE to put it in...the unique shape requires some thinking.  I have 3.  One for everything including cords and cables, one for the camera plus memory sticks, and a Sony brand \"ever-ready\" case.  Depends on how long you're out and how fast you want to access the camera..at what level of protection.  Think.<br />You'll want an extra battery.  Perhaps a travel charger, otherwise you charge the battery by plugging the CAMERA in the wall (!)...thanks Sony.  :-(<br />Buy a UV filter (58mm) to protect the lens.<br />This camera is expensive, and generally reliable - it's a Sony.  Many features I have not detailed, and it has a superb 10x OPTICAL zoom (and a 2x digital).  If you are thinking digital and want to not have to trade-up for a while, I suggest the Sony DSC-F707.  If you love photography, do not buy a smaller CCD chip than 5 MP...even if you buy another brand.  But I certainly recommend the Sony DSC-F707 camera for people to whom the image is important.","I have waited a long time for a good digital camera.  I have even purchased a few only to return them because the picture quality was clearly inferior to my 35mm cameras.  This is the greatest camera ever!  The pictures are clearer than 35mm.  The battery lasts a long time and you can even get longer lasting batteries.  The memory sticks (128) hold many pictures.  I have never run out of memory or battery when I am shooting my kids soccer games.  I am able to take great photos in difficult lighting situations,  such as ice hockey rinks.  I just plug it into my iMac and a few seconds later, I've got pictures.  It's so cool!  The shape seems kind of funny when you are in the store but it is very comfortable to use; like a real camera.  I am very happy with this camera!"]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot G2","amazon_reviews":["I got it today; Have to buy charger and a few other things for it. But it was a great deal. And great service.

It has been a great camera and I love it ...recently bought a new dslr...and it too is a canon....another great canon but my G2 will continue to travel with me!...my new camera ...a canon t2 I,,, gkpowell","Love this camera, it takes great photos, and is a great camera for the price.  I've had 2 of these cameras already.","I bought a G2 almost 10 years ago and it is still going strong.  I recently had to replace the battery (the original) and that prompted me to stop by here and write a review.  It is a 4 Megapixel.  we bought a small camera that can be carried in my wife's purse -- a 14 Megapixel -- and the G2 takes much better pictures.  In fact, it blows the new camera away.<br /><br />I paid top dollar for this camera and it has never let me down.","I bought a G2 a long time ago for almost $500. This is when they were a current model. Had it for many years with zero trouble. Great pictures, great flexibility, great feel. Finally bought a Nikon digital SLR and a Canon digital ELPH camera and stopped using the G2. Sold it n eBay in excellent shape for about $150 a couple of years ago.<br /><br />Bought several other Canon cameras in the meantime including a brace of SD1200IS's, an S3, a A70, and an S60. All nice to very nice cameras.<br /><br />Recently was looking through eBay and noted that G2's had fallen in price so that you got buy full kit G2's for about $50. In other words, free.<br /><br />So I bought one. It is awesome and I am in love with a G2 again. The handling is great, the full controls are great, the images are excellent. It is my favorite camera for when you don't need something tiny.<br /><br />If you want a true semi-pro digital camera for very little money, check out the G2 and it successors. Huge value and performance.","I have had this more than 5 years now, of course used it extensively and have really had no issues so far.<br />Its great that the LCD is protected.","I am very satified at how my order was handled and how quickly it arrived. It is in perfect condition.<br />Thank you<br />Ted","The Canon PowerShot G2 is a little smaller than the PowerShot S1 IS, which I have. The G2 can take half-minute, low-res/low-quality sound movie clips. Generally, photos by the G2 are not as grainy (especially dark colors) than the S1 IS, but not because it has 0.8 more MP.<br /><br />Based on my experience, chromatic aberration was often lower on the G2, but can still come out somewhat fuzzy in some situations, e.g. not suited for professional photography. For example, taking a picture of a table you are to include in a sell sheet for a brochure, the nameplate was unattractively hard to read. Overall, the G series IMO was very fast like a point-and-shoot.<br /><br />It is not compact enough to fit in an average pocket. The lens cap fit more securely than on the S1 IS.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this camera if high-quality family, outdoor, etc. photos are your ticket, even if the camera does not have RAW mode. Some G series have RAW mode. (Sorry, I did not check to see if the G2 has it.)<br /><br />By the way, regardless of lighting conditions, the G2 did very well. The S1 IS can take decent photos in low lighting as well, but focusing during movies was a challenge, especially indoors.<br /><br />My only complaint about the G2 is it takes a lithium battery pack, unlike the S series that takes four AA batteries. Either way though, the battery life is very good, that and the camera will work for many years if proper care is heeded.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Photo quality: 5/5<br />Battery life: 5/5<br />Durability: 5/5<br />Shelf life: 5/5 (in this instance)<br /><br />Con:<br /><br />Movie quality: 1/5 (common for a camera in its day)<br /><br />Five stars on this one, Canon!","Canon PowerShot G2 4MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom<br /><br />I bought the black Powershot G2, however the features on this triple-tone champagne beige colored case are the same.<br /><br />This is an amazing camera.  I've shot flower and jewelry closeups that compete favorably with higher megapixel models.  Clarity is exellent, ease of use very good.  This is a semi-pro model that would be a great choice for a beginner or a more advanced photographer.<br /><br />The zoom lens and auto-focus does an amazing job both outdoors in natural light or in a photo cube.<br /><br />Download is fast and simple, and there are a variety of formats supported.<br /><br />Comes with a re-chargeable lithium ion battery.<br /><br />A fully molded hand grip eliminates problems encountered with earlier models.  Featured is an extending 3x, F2.0 - F2.5 'Zoom Lens', evaluative center-weighted spot metering, 3 selectable focus areas and 10-bit RAW mode.  Comes with a 32MB compact flash card, but add a 2, 4 or 8GB card and you're good to go ... anywhere.<br /><br />Highly recommended.","I've had my Canon G2 for four years and it still takes simply Gorgeous pictures. People ask me if my pictures on the wall was from a studio. I tell them I shot them with my Canon. Crisp and super clear pictures. Easy to use. The best find!!  Love it!!!!! Even when you enlarge to 10x15. The clarity is still perfect...","This is the kind of camera that is a joy to use and explore. I have been using this along with a Digital SLR for about 3-4 years now and it still works great. I must have shot over 10000 shots using this camera with most shots being exceptional. The lens is fantastic, build is rugged, battery life is exceptional. This is a classic camera worth keeping for many years. For an avid photographer, the Powershot 'G' series is a good camera to have along with an SLR.","I've had this camera since April 2003, and it has been one of the best electronics purchases that I have made.  I've taken about 5,000 shots with this camera to date, and the image quality with all of them is outstanding, even by today's standards.<br /><br /> This camera is capable of producing images up to 11x14 inches without noticeable image grainyness.  The F2.0 lens is superb and produces super sharp images.  The features are fantastic.  The panorama mode is something I use a lot more that I thought I would and produces stunning, seamless panoramas which could easily pass as gallery prints.<br /><br />If you can still find this camera, purchase it!  You will not be sorry.","The G2 is a special camera. I bought it after 3 months of research in December 2002. It was a time when Canon had fixed all previous issues with the G1 and was improving on G2 to release the G3. I wanted a digital camera that can be used as a point and shoot one and also some advanced features for me to do some pro kind of photography and guess what I concluded and bought... the G2  After having it for more than 2 years, I think I can write a reasonable review of it. It is a simple advanced camera !!! Sounds like an oxymoron, but it really is that. It is simple enough that an average Point and shoot person can use it and advanced enough that a pro can do some good shots with it. It has enough options in the preset modes to give a quick nice picture in each of those modes and also has a set of manual features for more creativity. The pictures are clean, crisp and nice. It has the largest lens compared to any camera in that segment. The software that comes along with the box is good value for money & sophisticated. I do not have to list the long line of features that this camera gives for such a small price<br /><br />Some of the negative things I find in this camera are<br /><br />1. Is heavy and is a little oversize to be carried in the pocket<br /><br />2. The operations like switch on, switch off, writing image to disk and few other actions are a little slow.<br /><br />3. The flash recharge is also slow.<br /><br />If you are a beginner or just want a simple easy to use point and shoot camera, don't buy it. If you are pro and want an advanced camera for professional shots, don't buy it. If you are inbetween, then this camera is for YOU.<br /><br />Otherwise, is a great camera, love it and I think I have already taken my investment out of the camera, but looks like this just the beginning !!!","This was our first digital camera.  Very easy to use, useful features, and high quality photos.  Definitely a good deal.","I bought this camera in early 2003 when the camera was to be discontinued and sold around $400. I am mostly a happy user of this camera.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Excellent lens, very bright (F2.0) which make shooting indoor without flash a possiblity.<br /><br />2. Good resolution. 4MP is enough even today.<br /><br />3. Great photography control, more F stops, great range of shutter speed which you won't see in most consumer level digital cameras. This means you can shoot a wide range of objects under many different environment, without compromised quality.<br /><br />4. Better looking than successors like G3, G5.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Relatively lousy battery life using the bundled battery<br /><br />2. Slow startup time. This sometimes becomes intolerable when you want a fast shot.<br /><br />3. Hard to get CF card out of the camera.<br /><br />4. ISO 400 speed gives noisy image quality. However this is the issue with most consumer digital cameras.","I have had this camera for more than a year and I am just now getting to write a review. Which means I have had much time and practice to test this camera.<br />This camera is very much in the middle and by that I don't mean just ok. It is not to hot and it is not too cold, it is \"just right!\" It has features and manual controls for those who like to manipulate their shots, but in the same respect if you are used to just snapping a picture with one button and letting the camera do the work, then this camera is for you too! The image quality is great! You can buy accessories and extra lenses for it just like those hot shots with expensive film cameras! I have 3 lenses and two filtering lenses(polarizing and UV filter.) One of my extra lenses is a macro lens which really is wonderful. Which brings me to the point that the camera's macro capabilities are wonderful as is! If you don't know what macro means, I can take a picture of those unsightly pores it gets so close. I have taken some wonderful nature photographs with the macro. I love up-close, detailed pics. This camera has a little bit of everything but not too much it is overwhelming. If you want to use it, it is there and if you don't keep it on automatic! The best part is that there have been two cameras in the \"G\" line that have been introduced since the G2 but they aren't as good as this one(in my opinion.) So the price has dropped dramatically you can get one for less than 300 if you know where to look.<br />I just cannot stress enough how much this camera has been in service to me. I never even used a regular film camera before I got this camera because I never had the money to get a really good one. Sure I took the occasional pic with my aunt's point and shoot film camera at Christmas, but that wasn't much fun. When I got this camera I just experimented and took soooooooo many pictures. I am really enjoying photography. I guess the reason I never got interested in photography before was the expense of film and then developing, as well as not being sure the pictures were even any good until you got them back from the drug store. With this camera you just look at the shots and if they stink you delete them and take another shot. No wasted film! IF you don't have a printer at home then you can easily take them to Walgreens or upload them to Walmart's site and get prints from your digi pics. So simple.<br />I have experimented with many consumer valued digital cameras when I took my photography class last year( which was the reason I bought this camera) and let me tell you, it was the best in the class. We had Kodak and Olympus and so many other brands and they all stunk compared to mine. Olympus C something was pretty comparable but still not as good as my G2. I would recommend this camera to the new aspiring photographer as well as to the family photographer who wants to capture all the good things. I am sure once we become professional photographers we will have a SLR digital camera but for anyone less than a professional who is actually getting paid for their pictures, this is the best quality at the best price. When printed on photo quality paper my digital pictures are as good as if not better than other film photographer's pictures. I have been told my shots are good enough to be in National Geographic! Have fun with this joyful contraption.","I have had my canon for almost a year now, and I just want all to know who are looking for a camera, that there are a lot of cameras out there that you will not be satisfied with if you are looking for excellent photo quality.. this camera creates beautiful pictures, and they are easy to load on the computer with included software, and when I order prints, they look like they were done professionaly.  this camera is not for someone who wants a camera you can slide in your pocket, it is an amatuers camera and is made for good quality picture taking, it can be attached to a tripod, and is intened for light duty amatuer photos, however, if you dont mind the weight of it, it is great for all your picture taking needs, and it really isnt that heavy, just not as slender as the little pocket cameras, same with the G3 by canon, anyway defientely an A+ on this one.","In general this is a very nice camera with lots of goodies and quite foolproof for even a beginner.  Lots of functions, good optics and high resolution, all give it high marks.<br />On the downside, the camera has a serious speed problem. If you're used to the typical 35mm SLR, this is not the camera for you.  The time it requires to focus (a couple of seconds!?) as well as the time it takes it to 'save' (probably about 5-10 seconds with the color monitor open) an image and ready itself for the next one all but guarantee lack spontaneity in picture taking.  A moving toddler, a pet, virtually any unstaged snapshot are usually ruined due to the camera's slow reaction time.<br />The software that accompanies the camera has goods and bads as well.  While it offers all the capabilities one would want, it is cumbersome and immature as a product - or rather a medley of products thrown together and forced to talk to each other.  Yes, you can adjust nearly any parameter you might want, touch up pictures, make photo albums, etc. But try just clicking on the print button to print one single picture out - it is infuriating. Page after page of dialogs, repetitively asking for the same information, often in uncomprehensible ways.  At the end, that single 4x6 picture you wanted printed on a 4x6 paper ends up in the wrong orientation, parts of a head cut off and parts of the paper left white.  Ouch!","This was my 2nd digital camera.<br />My first being a 1 megapixel kodak.<br />The first thing I noticed is the outstanding low light ability this larger aperature faster lens had over my first camera.<br />It handles white balance very well in all but the most difficult situations.<br />The only drawback I noticed is the macro feature can be frustrating in an indoor situation,<br />It tended to overexpose with the flash and the optional macro ring light is too expensive to consider casually.<br />Overall it has been a fine camera and it has encouraged me to consider moving into a digital SLR (from Canon ofcourse)","The Canon G2 gives amazing color.  Get a good canon printer like the i950 and you'll get amazing prints.  It does black and white very well and gives great bright colors in landscape photos.  My only real complaint is it's super slow.  I upgraded from the Toshiba M4 2.1 megapixel camera and I honestly wish that I'd kept it too.  The Toshiba, while three years older than the canon caught better candid shots. I find that when using my Canon I cannot capture good candids of people or animals, it's so slow that the subject moves before it records the scene.  Super slow.  It hesitates all of the time and the red eye flash alerts your subject that you are there, totally ruining the picture.  I'm either looking at buying a Canon 10D or buying back my old M4 for now.","Honestly, this is an incredible camera. Takes great quiality pictures, along with many awesome special options and effects that you can add. Pretty much the only thing I don't like about it is how you connect the usb cable and power cord in, kind of a stupid design, but not really a big thing, otherwise the camera is great!!!","I like my Canon G2's \"stealth mode.\"  Its f/2 lens shoots in low light without a flash.  Other digital cameras have an f/2.8 lens, requiring twice the light.  Plus the viewscreen flips out and rotates.  I can put the camera on the floor, against a wall, on a glass on a table, etc. allowing me to shoot at slow shutter speeds without a tripod. And because I'm not holding the camera to my eye, subjects don't realize I'm shooting pictures.  Lastly, the camera is completely silent.  Candid shots vs. posed pictures look completely different.  Posed, people make faces, stick out their tongues, etc.  Or they refuse to let me take pictures.  In contrast, in candid shots people look natural.<br />Then after I take the pictures, everyone wants to look at the pictures. This makes you popular at parties. Even the people who said they hate pictures of themselves want to look through the shots, and they love the pictures!  I feel like saying, \"Duh, if you stick out your tongue and scrunch up your face when you pose for a photo, you'll hate the pictures of yourself!\"<br />After using the Canon G2 you become aware of how obtrusive other cameras are: flashes going off, the loud snap of a 35mm camera, etc.<br />I also like the video mode. It takes pretty good 30-second videos, with sound. And, again, people don't react the way they react to someone shoving a video camcorder in their face. They ignore the little camcorder, and then are delighted to watch the video.<br />I like the \"continuous\" or \"motor drive\" mode, which takes up to 2.5 frames per second. For sports this is essential. For portraits it's useful: you tell the subject to smile, and you get a dozen shots to pick from, of every stage of the smile.<br />The \"macro\" mode makes close-ups of little things easy.<br />I also like that shooting hundreds of photos is free! The battery has never run out, and recharges quickly. But my 256MB card is too small. I'm upgrading to a 1GB card. As you learn to use this camera, you'll find yourself shooting far more pictures than you did with other cameras.<br />I've used my G2 heavily for almost a year, and it has never broken down.<br />My complaints about the G2:<br />- The \"AUTO\" and \"P\" modes should not be used.  These set the shutter speed at 1/640th of a second.  This is much faster than is necessary, diminishing your depth of field, using the flash unnecessarily, etc. Instead, I taped a reminder to the back of my camera, saying to use aperture priority at f/2 and 400 ISO in very low light, aperture priority at f/2 and ISO \"AUTO\" (50 to 100) in low light, shutter priority at 1/125 and ISO \"AUTO\" in medium light; and aperture priority at f/8 and ISO 50 in bright light.<br />- The \"auto\" white balance should also be avoided.  It often looks bad, often very bad. The manual settings (sunlight, tungsten, etc.) are easy to use and look great. I never need to use the manual white balance.<br />- Using autofocus and autoexposure result in a half-second lag between pressing the shutter release and taking the picture. You can get around this by using the \"continuous\" mode, or using manual settings.<br />- The G2's 34-104mm lens is adequate for 95% of my shooting, but there are times I've wanted a longer telephoto lens.<br />- 4 megapixels isn't as good as a pro 35mm camera. For 95% of my shooting it's adequate, but sometimes I wish I had 5 or 6 megapixels.<br />- 400 ISO is adequate for 95% of my shooting, but sometimes I've wanted more film speed.<br />All in all, the G2 does 95% of what the \"pro\" cameras do, and does lots of things the pro cameras don't do -- such as not being obtrusive, or too heavy to carry around. Weighing these pros and cons, I'd take my G2 over the \"pro\" SLRs.<br />--<br />Thomas David Kehoe, author of \"Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships\"","I've had this camera for over a year and have found it to be an excellent camera. It's easy to use as far as the basics are concerned. There seems to be every feature imaginable for an amateur picture taker like myself. There are many features I haven't even touched on yet. The pictures come out crisp and clear. It's easy to connect the camera to the computer too.<br />I also love the digital viewer because it moves in every direction. I've taken pictures with the camera over my head and they came out great.<br />However, there are a couple of minuses....<br />  It ony comes with a 32MB flash card, so the first thing you need as a larger one. At this point I'd suggest a 256MB or 512MB.<br />  It has red-eye reduction but it doesn't work very well. I think it works like most non single lens reflex cameras with an internal flash. I ended up buying a Canon external flash that connects to the hot shoe on top of the camera (Glad this camera has the hot shoe). This adds a lot of weight, but the indoor pictures come out great with NO red eye.<br /><br />I would've given this camera 5 stars if not for these two issues.","I'll keep it short; this is a great camera and yeilds excelent pictures.  It is easy to use in the \"point & shoot\" modes but also alows for flexibility if you want to go manual and get creative.<br />The photos look every bit as good as film in a 5 x 7 format (considering that you use a good imaging equipment).  This says it all....  We took our photos down to the local photo shop to have them re=printed on high quality paper and the guy who owns the shop said that these were the best digital photos he's ever seen.  He asked my wife to give him the make and model number so he could check out the camera more.","I've used my Powershot G2 for about a year now and love it.  The picture quality is superb.  I also consider the G2's support for an external flash a must in a digital camera.  This wonderful 4-megapixel camera works very well with the SpeedLight 420EX.  And you will be able to print out 8 x 10 photos that show remarkable detail.  Enjoy!","I really like this camera. It is my first digital camera. It took some getting used to. I have been using my Nikon 35mm SLR for about 35 Years. With my new Canon, I had to get used to looking into a paralex viewfinder, get used to the LCD screen to try and compose my pictures and digesting the two manuals,the software guide and owners manual which took a few 2 hours sittings. It was lucky for me to have a basic understanding of computers and electronics to understand everything in the manuals. However, having said the above, I am very happy with my new Canon Powershot G2. One last thing, every time I go back to the Amazon Canon website, the price keeps getting lower. I know that two more powershot editions have come out since the G2, but I didn't want to have my camera sell out and I couldn't afford to buy the G3 nor the G5.","I got this camera approx April 2002, same camera, but a limited edition that was black and looks more like a traditional 35mm camera.  The camera functions well, and takes good pictures, but if this is your first camera I would look elsewhere.<br />If you are looking at getting into higher level photography however, this might be a good place to start.  It's digital, so you don't have to pay the high costs of developing, and the point and shoot function actually takes really good pictures, so if you are still learning, but see something you want to take a picture of, you can.<br />This camera presents the best of both worlds.  It is simple to use in the plain point-and-shoot mode, but it also has all the bells and whistles of a traditional 35mm camera.  You can choose your own fstop and aperture, and choose to shoot black and white.<br />There is also a neat function in this camera for panoramics.  It comes with a photostiching program, and the camera has a panoramic mode, where the viewscreen shows pictures side by side as you take them so you can ensure you don't miss any of the panorama.  When you take photos in this mode, the camera also labels the files with tags of \"_a\" \"_b\" etc, after the file number, so that you know they are part of one panoramic shot.<br />All in all, I have been very pleased with this camera, because I like to take beautiful pictures, but am not a pro and can't justify [the price] for my camera.  This camera gives you all the options you want, and with the largest pixel setting, the photograph you take will print out larger than an 8 1/2 X 11 sheet of paper.<br />***Warning:*** If you plan on taking a lot(more than 50)of the largest size pictures at one time, buy at least one 128 MB memory card.  You will be glad you did.","I bought this camera with snapshots of our almost-here new baby in mind. As this was my first digital camera, I figured I'd better practice taking pictures with it before she got here, so I started shooting flowers, insects, whatever was around. Unbelievable. I have never owned anything but basic point-and-shoot cameras (in fact, a significant percentage of the pictures I've taken in my life have been through disposable cameras!) and have never been much into taqking \"artsy\" pictures, but this thing made me look like a pro right out of the box. While the camera will do everything for you if you like, it also allows for manual control of essentially all of the things that \"shutterbugs\" play with (ie: focus, exposure, f-stop, lenses, filters). I am NOTHING LIKE an afficianado, but this camera has spurred my interest in the hobby --- and allowed me the flexibility to play with the settings as I learn. Did I mention it takes excellent pictures out of the box? Having done a fair amount of research before buying this---including talking to a lot of folks who have forgotten a lot more about cameras than I will ever know--- I am of the opinion that this is far and away the best value in digital cameras available in this range.","GOOD THINGS:<br />*the battery: last long, charges fast<br />*picture quality: Best ever<br />*came with all that was needed [others don't]<br />*zoom: GREAT [can zoom on pictures already taken]<br />* looks cool<br />BAD THINGS:<br />-CF card only holds 32 pictures [ we bought on with room for 256 pictures]<br />Over all GREAT camera","I received the Canon Power Shot G2 as a 21st birthday gift from my husband. I've fallen in love with it in the short three weeks I've had it. From its self-timer to video recording capabilities, the features on the camera are outstanding! The picture quality is clear and gorgeous. I feel like a professional when I use the Canon Power Shot G2.<br />Another very important thing is the battery is very strong and stays charged for a very long time.  This camera is a must have for the digital picture people out there!","I've been using this camera for more than a year and I'm fully satisfied with it. It has small auto focusing problem in the certain conditions, but it doesn't happen often.","I looked at the high end digital camera's and for the quality this certainly fit the price. It has all the advanced features I was looking for without the really expensive price tag. The quality of the photographs are great, I also bought a very nice color printer made for photographs, they don't look quite as good as 35MM but they are pretty good and once in my photo album people don't notice.","After reading the owners manual once, I had little problem using 90% of this camera effectively, although I have been taking pics for a good 20 years now.  The camera performs as claimed and takes great pics.  The shutter response is a bit slower than my EOS Elan II, but is better than other point and shoot film cameras or lower-priced digital cameras I've used.  All in all, the shutter response was not a problem for me.  Within a month of getting the camera I took it on my first trip to Japan.  It handled everything well, and the weight was not a problem carrying around Japan for 6 days jumping in and out of trains and stores.  The pics turned out just great.  The 32MB memory card they provide is useless...256MB cards are pretty inexpensive these days.  I haven't gotten the lens adapter or filters yet, and I miss having a polarizing filter, but the auto-balance feature in Adobe Photoshop Limited Edition (came with the cam) helps a bit.  Good luck!","This camera is everything I wanted and then some. Easy to use. My family thinks I should go pro. That's how good this camera makes me look. I bought the 256MB card which it'll hold up to 999 best quality pictures. Everything right down to the battery on this camera is perfection. Thank-you Canon!","I have been using the Canon Powershot G2 for about 2 months, 4000 pictures later I am VERY impressed with this camera. The Canon Powershot G2 is a joy to use. It has a superfast F2-2.0 3x optical zoom lens. The image quality is astounding, I can easily make 8x10 photographic prints that you couldn't tell from a 35 mm. The shutter responds very quickly provided you prefocus on the subject, which I find no big thing when taking sports pictures. The controls are well positioned and logical. The inclusion of the RAW file system is a major plus for hard core image editing. I have bought the macro, wide angle, and telephoto adapters for this camera and they all work very well. The Macro performance is fantastic. This camera is absolutely perfect in every way except one, and this is a fault all digitals have not just the Powershot. This fault is that images taken above ISO 100 and noisy. HOWEVER, I highly recommend getting a program called Neat Image Pro that reduces noise in pictures if you enjoy shooting at high speeds. I give Canon major kudos for this camera. However, I recommed you go for the G3 now that its out, I find its shutter speed improvements worth it.","If you sort the reviews already available here by \"Most Helpful\", you'll notice that the technical features that made Powershot series a pain in the rear of Nikon/FujiFilm/Olympus are already well documented.<br />The bundled ancillaries (software, maintenance stuff etc) is unarguably the best on the market, period, the support for IBM's 1 GB microdrive (which Nikon did not have until recently), the hot shoe being right on the camera, the superb CanonScan software that makes it a cinch to get your snaps on your machine even for tech-phobic folk, the sturdier heavier body of the camera that makes it easier to balance,  CP-10 card photo printer support, the new vivid color mode, the wireless remote control, the plethora of compatible flashes (Speedlite 220EX, 380EX, 420EX,  and 550EX to be precise), the possibility of recording videos WITH sound up to 120 seconds, or 30 seconds in a larger frame size (Nikon wannabes note...until recently, Nikon did not support sound in videos) ...etc etc.<br />Yes, all of this is outstanding and even if you don't get most of it, YOU WILL BE SURPRISED eventually after you have used and discovered your G2 Powershot for while, when you find out why Canon was the best choice you could have made!<br />HOWEVER, amidst the celebration of all this doohickey one thing we often neglect to consider is the quality of the pictures themselves -- isn't THAT the main purpose of a camera, digital or otherwise? All the convenience in handling, maintaining and uploading wouldn't be worth jack if the pictures themselves looked better with another camera!<br />And in this important department of \"quality\", I have always wanted to compare G2 and Nikon's top comparable options (specifically 995, 4300 and 5700) because these are the only two brands that'll give you near-pro functionality and quality at consumer prices (apologies to FinePix/Olympus owners).<br />I had the luxury recently of trekking with friends who own Nikons 4300 and 995 respectively. Pretty much the ONLY thing I've found Nikon-freaks mentioning since the release of G2 is the oh-so-exalted Nikor lens because Canon beats Nikon hands-down in pretty much every other department as noted above. Me and my 2 friends are all more or less at a similar level of expertise with photography, none professional. But all have owned and worked with our camera for a while and read the manuals thin.<br />Here is what I believe after head-to-head comparisons, your mileage may vary --<br />OUTDOOR PICTURES IN BRIGHT LIGHT:<br />Canon's colors were more real. Clarity is good with all 3 cameras but Nikon seemed a little reddish to me.<br />PICTURES IN LOW LIGHTING (INDOOR OR NIGHT PICTURES):<br />This is where Canon where truly leave you in \"shock and awe\" (sorry for the choice of words). I was stunned with some of Canon's ultra-realistic  pictures when only a candle was on in a room for example.<br />FIGURES/FACES OF PEOPLE:<br />Unfortunately, even with a lot of tweaking, Nikon is just simply better at faces of people for some reason. Canon is too, er, \"real\"? We agreed that with Nikon ...the colors, shades, contours of the same face can be made to look a little better than with Canon -- and I am excluding software based trickery of course.<br />DEFAULT MODE:<br />If you opt to use only the default modes in Canon and Nikon, then Nikon will win in terms of photo quality. Canon provides excellent detail and clarity, but the default mode has the now notorious \"white specks\" or dotted edges. This is easily taken care of with some adjustment (read the manual).<br />ALL IN ALL: I feel Canon's results are more \"honest\". It just captures the reality in every sense-- colors, the range of what your eyes see etc. This usually means it is better for me, but if my pictures were going to be mainly of people I would also give the Nikons a good look.<br />Otherwise, Canon G2 Powershot is the best there is. Even better than the new G3 (for now).","My husband bought me this camera for my birthday, and I've had it for almost a year and absolutely love it! I'm a terrible photographer - don't know much about setting up a shot - but with this digital camera, I'm able to keep taking the picture until I get what I want. I went to my friend's wedding and took hundreds of photographs, and was able to give them a CD with a lot of nice pictures rather than a package of blurry prints of people's hands, faces, noses, etc. :)The one feature I like about this camera that isn't found in any other digital camera brand(to my knowledge), is the rotating screen. I love that my screen is protected when I'm not using it, and I usually have it out when I'm taking pictures so my fingers don't end up on it like they would in other cameras with fixed screens. I also love how it can be both manually manipulated as well as fully automated. Because I'm not afraid of wasting money on developing film now, I'm getting more into the manual stuff. This camera is definitely not intimidating for a beginner like me!","Have had my G-2 just over a year. Was a God send on our trip to Alaska. Have taken well over two thousand pictures and cataloged same on CDs.<br />  At first the many features available are overwhelming. Fortunately the documentation is top rate. Takes time to learn but well worth the effort!!!!! Big on air shows. The rapid fire capability \"Auto Exposure\" has yealed several once in a lifetime images I would have missed the old way. Big on flowers. Adjusting the flash output is great..... Exposure compensation takes takes three pictures rapid fire at different exposure settings. Once in the computer pick out the best.<br />  Love the flip-out LCD Monitor. This feater has enabled excellent over head shots without getting the horizon askew. No longer have to be on my belly to shoot ground loving flowers. Could go on for some time.<br />  Yes, set it on \"Auto\" and let the kids take your picture with good results. Great camera.","I was looking to purchase my first digital camera and originally bought a Toshiba 3.2 megapixel which claimed to provide photos equal in quality to 35mm cameras.  I was very disappointed. After tons of research, I purchased the Canon G2.  I am still amazed at the quality of the pictures.  It is easy to use and comes with everything you need.  Many other digital cameras come with 8 or 16MB cards which don't store enough pictures.  The Canon G2 comes with a 32MB card which holds about 19 high quality photos.  It also comes with a rechargable battery. One of the greatest features is the wireless remote control which has the zoom feature.  The LCD screen pivots out to allow you to see the picture you are composing (use the remote to zoom in or out) and snap the picture once you have arranged the perfect shot. Now I can be in group shots and vacation pictures.<br />The Canon G2 was about $100.00 more than the camera I originally bought which needed more memory at a cost of $60 and rechargeable batteries at a cost of $40.  So, basically the Canon G2 cost the same thing, but provided much better quality and extras.<br />I read another review which stated the red eye reduction did not work.  This only happens to me when I am taking pictures in a very dark room or outside when there is no light.  If I turn the light on in the room I am taking the picture, I have no problem.  If the picture does have red eye, it is easily eliminated with the software provided.<br />GREAT CAMERA!  THANK YOU CANON.","Amazing colors, amazing close ups, excellent camera all around. Very pleased I bought it.","Great camera as everyone else has pointed out.  Two of my biggest beefs/annoyances (which don't affect the picture quality) are:<br />1. It's big and heavy.  Compared to a SLR, it's about the same. But many other cameras pack similar features in a smaller/lighter size.<br />2. The grip is too small and very slippery.  My older Kodak camera had a rubberized grip and was very easy to hold and compose shots with.  It's hard to get a good grip on the camera so it feels like I'm gonna drop it when taking shots on the go.<br />It would have been nice if there was a built-in lens cover too.<br />Ok, enough griping.  It's a nice camera.","Easy to use.  Takes great pictures.  Has lot of extra features to continually improve on your picture taking experiences.","I have enjoyed many cameras including a Nikon FE. I must say that I enjoy the G2 more than any of the others. The ease of use and the ability to be as creative as you want is remarkable. You can't go wrong with this one.","If you are looking for a great digital camera you cannot go wrong with the G2.  The camera is as easy to use as the most basic point and shoot models, but with every manual control you need to get the most out of photography.  Picture quality is excellent, and with the raw mode even greater detail is available.  A larger cf card will be a wise investment, unless you want to hunt down photo shops to burn cds for you while on your vacation.  I bought a 256mb Viking card.  It comes with a great bundle, 32mb cf card, remote control, easy to use manual, along with all of the requisite cables.  The software is also easy to learn how to use.  Very high quality construction throughout(the switches on the G3 seem to have gone backwards in quality).","This is an excellent product, you just need to read the instructions well before using so that you are not disspointed. I have been using all manual 35mm cameras since i began doing photography and this camera has convinced me that the future is truly Digital. It does have many limitations as the digital technology still is under development, but you will find nothing but advantages when compared to a top notch 35mm point and shoot film camera, as you have greater creative control over exposure which is hard to find in 35mm film equivalent other than SLR's. I found the more important limitations are shutter lag; manual focus; horrible optical viewfinder (absolutly no viewfinder info at all); noise in low light high ISO settings; limited ISO range (iso 50-iso400) certain restrictions on settings and controls when using programmed settings. The shutter lag, to me, is the most anoying of all, but certainly something that you get used to. I was dissapointed mostly by the manual focus feature since this is actually a \"virtual\" manual focus, and a very poor one at that.<br />However, as to image quality, I find the RAW format to be great! Little noise (specially when using ISO 50) high resolution images and great colors. Since the RAW file is like a digital negative, you can process one raw immage as you like on your computer. All the available preset white balance settings work as colour filters without the hassle.<br />Even though there are the above mentioned limitations, which, again, are expected from a point & shoot camera, this camera is wonderful and a recomended buy (specially for the price it is running for now). For those of you used to 35mm photography, you will miss the superior image quality but you will not miss wondering how your pictures turn out after you shoot a roll (instant review of resulting image is priceless); fighting with the photolabs over ruined negatives or copies; paying hundreds to these labs for developing services. Also, i have found it of great use when doing pictures of people on the street, as I can show the pictures to a reluctant subject who would then be more willing to let me shoot more pictures with this and my other cameras.<br />I will definately move over to a Digital SLR as soon as they become more affordable and the technology improves. I have my eye on the new Canon EOS 10D.","This is a great camera.  I have taken pictures seriously for 40 years. The advantage of this is control over the final print--no more lousy prints from processors. It's been great from the start, and offers something new for those people bored with film photography, and you can preview the results. Also, imagine the possibilities! I wish the compact flashes held more photos, and I wish there wasn't a lag in the shutter, but I'm sure that will be corrected as digital cameras get better.  Imagine press photos without carrying film and processing equipment!","I'm new to digital photography.  I've been using the Canon Powershot G2 for three months and it's excellent.  It's easy and fun to use.  The more time I spend learning all the features the more enjoyable it is to use.","The G2 is my third digital camera, and the first that lets me control images the way I'm used to with film camera. WIth multiple programs as well as full manual override, I can pretty much do anything with the G2 that I can with any of my 35mm cameras, so long as I don't intend to enlarge the images too much. For web work it's fantastic, and for prints up to 8x10 it's pretty darn good. Decent 11x14s are possible if you pick your subjects carefully.<br />It's not perfect by any means. The in-camera charger is a pain to use, and the batteries and auto charger are very expensive. The focal range of the lens is equivalent to a 35-105 in 35mm, which is not as wide as I'd like to go (I use my 24mm lens a lot in 35!). But aftermarket batteries and chargers are available, as are aftermarket accessory lenses. I've found good deals in both by hunting around on a web a bit.<br />And the plusses far outweigh the negatives. The swivelling monitor  is one of the best designs I've seen on a digital camera. The IR remote allows me to take photos with the hamera held 6' over my head on a monopod. The manual control makes astrophotography possible. And so on.<br />For the price, I think it's one of the best deals in 4 Mpixel cameras. Automatic enough for the newcomer, yet with all the manual flexibility a pro might want. I'm happy with my choice.","I absolutely do not understand why this camera ( G2) has received a few poor customer reviews.<br />To date I have shot maybe 500 or 600 pics and somewhere around 25 to 30 two minute movies. Now I admit the movies at best are only a nice feature, and you shouldnt expect great resolution, but the movie feature is what it is, a perk! Don't expect great resulation with the movie feature, its just a fun feature<br />What the G2 gives you is out standing pics. I mean absolutely out standing pictures!!  With the G2's built in AC battery charger I have had ZERO low battery problems. ( I also own a Olympus 380 and I know that digital cameras can go through batterys like geese goes through oats!!) With the G2 I have taken 200 pics, reviewed every pic, and on the same charge also shot 4 or 5 two minute movie clips, and had battery to spare.<br />I also bought a 512 meg memory card. At the G2's lowest resoultion I can store 5200 pics (thats five thousand two hundred), at the higest compression and resolution, 280 pics, and maybe 6 two minute movies.<br />We just finished seven days in Hawaii, probably shoot 240 outstanding pics, and 8 two minute movies. Thats the equivelence of 10 rools of film!!  After we returned home I downloaded 50 of the 240 pics, to walmart.com. The entire cost was 17.80 including freight. All of the pics were 35 mm quality. six of the 50 I had blown up to 8X10's. If you are still using a film camera .....STOP!!!<br />I guess by now you have figured out that I am a G2 fan.  Oh by the way today is Christmas.  I shot another 144 pics, and 12 two minute movies, I am still on the same charge and the pics were GREAT!!!","I've been using my camera for about a week now but I have to say I love it.  My friends and family who all have other models agree that for the few bucks more this one is well worth it.  I ordered a 256MB card too so the amount of pictures and video I can record is amazing and far more enough then I need.  Pictures come out so clear !! I was debating between this and a camcorder but was extremely happy with my decision.  Digital Camcorders only allow you to take pictures at only 1 MP where this one is 4.1MP and allow you to record up to 2 hours on a proper card !  This camera is well worth the money and would recommend it to anyone from beginner to advance.","This review is largely taken from an online review of digital photography in general, and the iBook/iPhoto and Canon G2 in particular. The review is part of my personal/hobby ....<br />I've been using the G2 fairly intensively for about 2 months. I use it in close combination with my iBook and iPhoto, together with GraphicConverter. I have some amateur photography expertise and a good amount of computing expertise.<br />Overall I am very pleased with my experience, but I can say with certainty (and surprise) that we are still quite early in the digital phtography age. As excellent as this product is, there is vast room for improvement in both the G2 and in digital photography in general. The good news is that even in its current immature state it's worth doing.<br />Pros and Cons follow:<br />Pro: Shutter lag is tolerable if one can get focus lock<br />Con: Focusing. The camera is often very slow to obtain focus lock. This means one presses the #!% shutter button and nothing happens. Manual focus is very clumsy (dismal) and hard to use, so the focus lock problem is serious and sometimes infuriating.<br />Pro:Good optics.<br />Con: Doomed optics. Uninspiring lens assembly design, silly device for attaching lenses and filters.<br />Pro: RAW Format<br />Con: RAW Format: secret specifications, poor quality OS X versions of proprietary software<br />Pro: Solid, made in Japan. Relatively large lens allows some available light photography.<br />Con: Big and heavy.<br />Pro: LCD view panel<br />Con: The worst optical viewfinder ever made for any camera.<br />Pro: AC adapter brick not too heavy/bulky.<br />Con: Flimsy cover for camera power/USB connections. AC Adapter clearly has a mismatched plug/cord that tends to fall out.<br />Pro: Programmed settings.<br />Con: Inability to save personalized settings.<br />Pro: Macro feature<br />Pro: CF II support<br />Con: Bundled OS X software is incomplete or of poor quality; Canon refuses to share information with alternative developers. On the other hand the Windows software (installed on Win2K) is even lower quality, with major apps that simply didn't work.<br />Pro: No SLR vibration, so decent photos at slow shutter speeds!<br />Con: Artificial shutter sound is way too loud, even at the quietest setting. Inexplicable! Need an optical cue that a picture was taken as well as a much quieter shutter sound.<br />Pro: Rapid shoot works well (disable flash)<br />Con: Can't use exposure lock feature if display is turned off.<br />Pro: Can use external flash.<br />Con: Flash exposures are often poor. One gets correct exposure only between about 6 and 12 feet away, otherwise pictures with the built-in flash are either under or over exposed.<br /><br />Con: The camera will power down while images are being transferred to a laptop, even when the camera is plugged in. With JPG images I can transfer about 25 before this happens. If you use Canon's software you get a warning dialog from the software, but if you use iPhoto it simply gives an error message and an empty .jpg file is created. Need to disable auto-off during those transfers.<br />Con: Automatic white balance is unreliable in daylight. Fails to recognize overcast light, must set this manually or images will be overly blue.<br />Digital Problems (all contenders, not just the G2)<br />- Shutter lag (time required from squeezing shutter to acquiring image)<br />- Lithium battery has poor performance at low temperature.<br />- CCD is \"slow\", about ISO 50-100. Can \"push\" to higher speeds, but more \"noise\" (unless super cool). Shutter speeds are slow.<br />- Limited dynamic range and color discrimination.<br />- Standards for image metadata and properties of camera are not well standardized and existing standards are not well supported.<br />- Getting color right across output media is so complex people make a good living as consultants doing this.","This camera is absolutely wonderful.  The 4 mega-pixel images look great both when viewed on a PC and when printed (I use a Canon S900).  Several of the other reviewers note that this camera takes better photos then their SLR cameras.  Obviously the interchangeable lenses of a SLR give you more creative options, but for basic medium-range pictures I would agree with the other reviewers - the Canon G2 seems to get the job done as well if not better.<br />The battery life is great.  I did find the 32MB memory card to be a bit small for day trips - after a few weeks I ordered a 128MB CompactFlash card from Amazon.com and have never again run out room.<br />One of the main features that distinguishes this camera from cheaper 4 MP cameras is the ability to control depth of field (amount of distance between the nearest and farthest objects that appear in focus) and the perception of motion (are moving objects blurred or frozen).  If you have no interest in this, you can just use the G2 in fully automatic mode.  If you have any interest in this, the G2 comes with the usual pre-set modes (e.g., Landscape mode - when selected the camera sets the average optimal settings for a landscape and you yourself don't need to know what they are).  If you have a lot of experience with this, the G2 can give you full manual control.  If you're not interested in controlling the aperture and shutter speed than this camera will still take beautiful pictures but this camera might be more (and more expensive) than you need.<br />Anyone thinking about this camera should also look at the Canon G3, which is slightly thinner and has a little bit longer of an optical zoom (4x versus 3x).  I've looked at the G3 and tried it out, but just recently ended up ordering another G2 to give as a gift.  The G2 is a great camera at a great price.","I was looking for a simple, yet high resolution digital camera and the G2 fits the bill. Its easy to use and provides excellent pictures in auto mode.<br />Things that I dont like:<br />The manual.<br />Optical zoom in a camera in this price range should be better. You lose picture quality with the digital zoom.<br />Video mode is Ok, barely passes.<br />Overall, with a name like Canon, I'd buy it again.","This camera is absolutely amazing.  The quality of the photos is incredible, more than comparable to my Nikkon N70.  In fact, most of my pictures are better on the G2.  It is extremely easy to use and has a lot of cool features like b&w and sephia, if you like to mix up your photos but hate having to change film in a regular camera.  Overall, I can 't say enough good things about it.  I am very pleased.","Pros<br />This camera can take excellent shots, in difficult lighting conditions, such as in backlighting. It practically never overburn the highlights and can show incredible details in dark area. This is  a fantastic camera. The colors are vivid, and the contrast and the skies are wonderfull. It also has a RAW MODE<br />It has a photo-stitch software that does wonders, creating panoramic pictures (excellent, up to 5 frames (20 megs picture frame))<br />Cons<br />1- limited zoom 3x<br />2- Can also have difficulty to focus, in low-light situations, specially on plain textures. But it also has a manual focus to override the automatic (good)<br />3- In a very few occasions, I saw in bright sunlight, a not perfect focusing on a few shots made in RAW mode<br />Conclusion<br />I would buy it over and over again. The only important thing missing is its low zoom of 3X.<br />I would immediately buy the G3 right away, if it had a 6x zoom.<br />I can send you pictures, I made last summer in the Maritimes (Nova Scotia, St-Edouard island)","Pros: Quality pictures, well built, point in any direction-pullout display panel, very clear display panel, absolute freedom to control camera functions, remote control.<br />Cons: Awkward adaptor for accessory lenses/filters, awkward manual focus, poorly arranged manual.<br />Automatic mode in any camera would give \"automatic-quality pictures\" (mediocre). This is why this camera is so great. You can EASILY control all its functions. Since it's digital, you can easily experiment with conditions to obtain perfect pictures. The pullout display panel is very convenient, and important for pictures taken over the head or at hip level. Only 2 things I do not like: the need for a stupid adaptor for accessory lenses or filters (they could add the thread on the lense at least for filters!); and the need to press and hold the manual focus. The manual, while easy to follow, is poorly arranged","I feel that this camera is a great value for the price, compared to other cameras.  The camera does almost everything that my Elan 7E does.  I even use it now for my portrait studio until I receive my D60.  It has lots of options to keep you shooting for hours.  The resolution is outstanding for its price.  Just compare it to some of the other cameras out there.  The only negative thing I have to say about the camera is that it is a little fussy when you are shooting in low light without a flash.  Simple fix, just use a canon speedlite.","I'm not a professional photographer but I have to say that digital is the way to go! I have Vivitar and Minolta 35mm cameras that have been \"retired\" for about 9 years because I got tired of paying for the processing of pictures that were out of focus, blue, etc. Now I know within seconds if I mess up and can dump the picture or take it home and tweak it! The G2 takes absolutely killer pictures, clear and focused. I use Jasc, AutoFx, Adobe and MS Digital Pro, to \"mess with\" my pictures but I usually don't HAVE to do anything. The image quality is perfect. I purchased the telephoto lens, the adapter, and that pulls objects in closely without degrading the image too much. The flash works best at a distance, not close up. You're better off turning on a light and turning off the flash for close up work. I love that it uses compact flash because the price keeps dropping on the cards! I got a 128 mb card for less than 50 bucks at a local big box store. (That's 61 pictures.) The battery lasts for days of shooting! (I had an Epson, a few years ago, that used AA batteries and I'm STILL finding dead batteries everywhere!)  All in all I am very happy with my G2!","i've been seriously taking pictures for over ten years.  i own several film slr(single lense reflex) and a trunk full of lenses, filters etc. i was apprehensive about down grading  from slr but did it because i did not want to spend over [$$$] for my first digital camera when i knew little about digital photography.  i was not even sure i would like it.  but .....this is a great camera! it has sold me for life!  if you are a photography enthusiast and you want a digital camera that is capable of giving you great shots and the  flexibility of an off camera flash, as well as more shooting modes than you will ever need, including manual mode, ability to set your white balance,auto bracketing,let's  not forget the rotating lcd which does come in handy,especially for self portraits! and so much more - for under [$$$]( i paid [$$$] before G3 came out) - this is your choice.  if you've previous owned any of the canon EOS slrs then you will feel completely athome with this camera! i've owned this camera for about 6mths, i deliberatly did not rate it right away. i'v never regretted my purchase.  my only complaint, and if you are reading several reviews you will have already read about the slower than desired auto focus.  once you get the hang of your camera and learn how to best utilize it,you can minimize this and you will be inspired by the great shots that you can capture.  for a non - slr - this camera takes superior images - it's no point and shoot - but it's not an slr.<br />stop reading right here and go and buy this camera!  if you want to know more about digital photography and the G2 - check out dpreview.com.  this is an excellent sight! only for the  serious at heart digital photographer.<br />recommended items: canon speedlite 420 ex flash a must!","I had been delaying buying a digital camera, but after shopping for awhile am so glad I chose the Canon S30. It is so easy to use and the clarity and color resolution is unbelievable. The software is very intuitive in the options it offers, and the camera itself is like a mini-PC. The only downside is: the battery pack lasts about a day of picture taking - filling a 64mb card (about 40 outdoor shots). Re-charging takes a few hours. I am now going to try to buy additional flash cards and a second battery so I always have a spare.","I consider myself an advanced amateur photographer.  I own a Minolta 3xi SLR, and this Canon G2 is my first digital camera.  I have done extensive research on 3MP to 4MP digital camera.  The final candidates are: Olympus C-4040Z, Canon G2, with G2 being the winner.<br />Things I like about G2 (from personal experience):<br />- swivel LCD very useful in quite a lot of situations.<br />- swivel LCD protects LCD when not in use.<br />- long battery life.  I have bought an extra battery just in case, but I have never used it so far (I have been using G2 for more than 3 months now).  On average, I can use one charge for about 200 shots, with 50% of shots taken with flash; or > 300 shots on normal usage.  I think I will use the extra battery when I go on travelling...<br />- manual focus magnifies the subject, thus allowing easy and accurate focusing.<br />- ability to show 9 thumnails at a time, and ability to let you jump 9 photos forward/backward at a time.<br />- remote control comes very handy.  The downside is: I always forget to turn on the remote control feature on the G2, and I wonder why my remote control is not working...  I wish future cameras will allow use of remote control, without having user to remember to turn on/off the remote control feature everytime he wishes to use it.<br />- G2 normally produces good and sharp photograph.<br />Things I dislike about G2:<br />- slow to focus: causing me to miss many great photos.<br />- unable to auto focus: the camera could not auto focus during night time even with street light.  The G2's light assist does not help much and is of little to no use.  Fortunately, manual focus is available.  On another situation, I cannot auto focus on subjects are close (less than 1.5 foot) to the camera.<br />- video recording has max time limit of 30 seconds.  This is useful for short clips, but generally videos require much longer than 30 seconds block.  Note: Olympus C-4040Z has no video time limit.<br />- unable to zoom in or out after you have started video recording.  However, you can zoom in or out before starting a video session.<br />- flash insufficient.  When taking indoor pictures, flash assisted photos will look artificial, and gives you a feel that there is insufficient light (i.e. subject too bright, background too dark).  I have read that adding an external flash will solve this problem, although I have never tried it.  In the meantime, I use Night mode to compensate for this artificial lighting.  With Night mode, your photo will look natural.  The drawback is: the subject will need to stay still a little longer for the shot, so that there is more exposure for the darker areas.  Unfortunately, my subjects do not always stay as long as I want them to.<br />- auto stitching does not work very well.  Initially, I was impressed by auto-stitching.  But upon further examination, I find that the stitching is done correctly only on certain parts of the photo.  For example, auto-stitch is done correctly at the bottom half joining two pictures, but somehow auto-stitch did not stitch the top half correctly (i.e. top half is misaligned).  In all, I would give auto-stitching a B- to C+ grade.<br />- photos taken tend to be more magenta in color.  Fortunately, I can resolve this by setting Saturation level to Low (from Normal).<br />- noise found in higher ISO.  Generally, G2 produces good quality photo at ISO 50 or ISO 100.  I do not recommend using any ISO higher than 100 since I experience a lot of noise at these higher ISO.<br />Summary of main points: G2 is an above average digital camera for an advanced amateur, with many bells and whistles to play with.  3x zoom might be a little too small, but sufficient for most shots.  Main problems of camera are slow focusing and sometimes inability to focus.  Strengths of G2 are swivelling LCD and sharpness.  Considering its price, it gives good value for money, but there is much room for improvement.<br />Note: You will definitely need a 128MB CF card.  32MB just isn't enough for a 4MP camera.","I bought this camera about two weeks ago. It takes awesome pictures. All of my friends, and family members are amazed at the results of the picutures that I've taken with my baby (Power Shot G2).<br />Before buying this, I had a lot of options including Olympus 4050, Nikon 4500, & all of those other cameras in the market, but I'll tell you what? Its the Best, period.","...<br />This is my first \"serious\" camera. I researched high and low, and this camera turned a once Olympus repeat customer into a Canon believer. The lens on this camera is very hard to beat. I challenge anyone to find a better lens at this price. If you want better quality you HAVE TO GO SLR!<br />Another major selling point was the rechargeable batteries. DONT BELIEVE THE SALES PEOPLE!! These batteries last FOREVER. I took 2 sets of pictures (122 each) on my new Viking 256MB memory card (purchased from Amazon) with previewing and slide shows in the hotel room ON ONE CHARGE!<br />Try that with a Kodak or Olympus. It's impossible!<br />Buy this camera, or the new G3. You will not be dissapointed!","I bought this camera three months back, and took more than 1000 pictures. Almost all of them were of excellent quality. The battery life is great, controls are comparable to any other good camera. Using the 440BX flash, the indoor pictures give fine details. I will give a five star rating to this camera.","Right out of the box (after I charged the battery) the camera takes great pictures.  Start by using the auto mode and then you can gradually experiment with the varied settings.  Don't worry, you won't waste \"film\"!  After taking my first photos, I connected the camera to my iBook and it automatically popped up on my desktop and transfered the photos to iPhoto. It's not inexpensive but worth the $ because it won't be outmoded next year like some of the low rez cameras.","I would have rated this camera a 5 if it weren't for the fact that it has proprietary batteries (expensive). They do last a very long time, but a backup is always needed and  a little bit expensive. I have taken this camera on 2 vacations where access to a computer to download the images wasn't available. With a 256mb flash memory card, I could take over 100 pictures at minimum compression. The results are amazing! From mountain vistas to macro shots of rocky mountain flowers and insects, the clarity is incredible! I would recommend this to any amateur photographer without hesitation.","I really love this camera. It takes excellent photos with very little fuss. Great clarity, color. I use Paintshop Pro, Adobe and Auto Fx for software and I really don't need to tweak the photos (I do anyway, I'm just like that.) Great battery life. I used to have an Epson that gobbled power, so this was a wonderful surprise! The only drawback I can see is the lack of lens choices. I'd get a larger flash card too. I got a 128 mb card...If you really need the len choices and have the money, I'd upgrade to the Canon D-60. All in all this camera is killer!","This is a great camera for the pro-consumer. I stepped up to this camera from a 1.2 MP Olympus, which I personally think took incredible pictures. I thought long and hard before moving from my trusted olympus.  I switched because this camera has great reviews everywhere from very technical sites to average users here on amazon.  I would have stayed with olympus if they switched to compact flash.<br />Here's some things about this camera:<br />- Heavy (relatively) although it's not too bad<br />- Feels solid<br />-The swivel/rotating lcd is very cool<br />- If you're afraid of technology or not interested in photography, this camera isn't for you.<br />-Don't forget that this camera uses a proprietary battery pack (same Li-Ion as canon cam corders so it should be easy to find).<br />-Get a 2nd battery pack.<br />- Uses CF or microdrive (very cool)<br />- I HATE when manufacturers use bizarre proprietary cables/connections. Unfortunately this camera uses a truly bizarre connector for the USB. The camera-side connector reminds me of the flimsy connector on a pcmcia modem - you know, the one that always breaks. I don't know why they didn't use a usb-b or micro usb like on my rio player.<br />Other than that, this camera takes great pictures that are truly amazing. I think, however that my olympus was easier to use (it only had 3 buttons). This camera is definately not designed for the beginner. (then again, it's not targeted toward that market)","Prior to purchasing this camera, I was not the most avid photographer...taking a few shots here or there on my 35mm. This camera has been so much fun to use that I've been taking it everywhere.  I consider myself to be quite the amateur photographer, and some of the reviewers here have stated if you want a point and shoot your money is wasted on this camera whose features can do so much more. I'm here to say that even if you are looking to buy a digital camera for point & shoot purposes, but are thinking about expanding your photography skills, get this!  I spent several months researching cameras, and this camera has been a dream come true. It is completely easy to operate right out of the box....so if you have been apprehensive about learning the tricks of digital photography like I have...no worries...the manual is easy to use and very user friendly. The greatest feature of this camera is the rotating LCD display. Self-portraits are quite easy, and when you are using the handy remote control to take shots of yourself with friends, you can zoom in based on what you see on the display. I have been having tons of fun taking black and white & sepia pictures, and experimenting with the exposure settings. A great companion to this camera is the \"Shortguide to Using the Powershot G2\", which I purchased through Amazon....it is extremely helpful to the amateur photographer who would like to learn more about taking advantage of some of the more complex features of the camera.  I purchased a 128MB Viking card with the camera & a carrying case; the 32MB card that comes with the camera does not hold that many pictures.  Also, as many of the other reviewers have noted....the battery life on this camera is fantastic! That was one concern I had about purchasing a digital camera....Canon has exceeded my expectations with this camera completely.","About the only thing this camera WON'T do is brush your teeth. I've had this camera 3 weeks now and it is truly amazing. This is my 2nd digital camera and the last one ate batteries to the point I couldn't afford it any longer. This camera keeps going and going and... I took about 250 photos and down loaded them and the battery guage was still showing full. Plus the I set the quality of the photos about 3 steps down from top quality. I could get 54 photos with the 32 MG flash card and I dare a layman to tell the difference between this camera and 35mm SLR.<br />I love it I'm certain in a few years they will put a tooth brush with it.","I picked this camera because it received a 9 out of 10 at cnet.com along with the Nikon but this one was rated as more user friendly.  How true.  It has tons of functions I havent used but I was able to point and shoot for a 5 week trip to the UK.  According to my sister, 4 mega pixels is near professional quality (and allows you to blow an image up really large).  I didn't realize this when I bought it.  I just thought 4 would be better than 2.","The price may seem a little high, but trust me this camera is worth every penny!  I just got it and I can't put it down.  It gives vibrant and rich colors, and is filled with great features.  Awesome swivel LCD, Champagne colored casing. also I have taken over 100 shots and the battery hasn't even budged!  In addition, if you have a 256 MB card like me, you'll get 220 pics at medium compression.  Like I said before, awesome camera!","The Powershot G2 is an awesome camera. It has loads of capability and flexibility for both manual and automatic shooting. The picture quality is outstanding...and upload to PC is fast and easy. This camera also has an excellent design and feel. It's heavier and feels more solid than many other digital cameras in this range. It feels good in your hands. An excellent choice for a 4 MP camera.","Having recently purchased this camera after owning a 1.2MP camera for 3 years, I really didn't know what to expect.  Pictures of similar quality, only larger?  The ability to print large photo's without pixellation?<br />What I didn't expect was not just larger pictures and larger prints, but absolutely superb images from almost every shot.  I have been impressed to the point that the thousands of other photo's I took, many of which I was very proud of, now look dull and almost comical by comparison.<br />This is a fantastic camera, with a myriad of customization controls and super point-and-shoot capability.  If you want to play with the manual controls, fine, they are available, and really broaden your photographic repertoire.  If you don't, using the Auto mode, I've found, will produce a perfect shot in almost every situation.  My old camera had a problem, like a lot of older digicams, in low light situations.  Not so the G2, which will take a shot in almost complete darkness and render a decent, if not lovely, image.  With dim indoor lighting, the camera just takes beautiful pictures, completely unimpeded by the ambient light.<br />The amount of detail, even incidental detail captured, is incredible.  One of the first shots I took in RAW mode was of the area overlooking my neighborhood, with the tops of houses in the foreground.  Looking at this same picture on the computer, I noticed what I thought was a dead pixel or two up in the corner of the sky. I zoomed in on that area, and zoomed in several more times to about 50X magnification, and lo and behold I had captured a fighter jet passing over our area!  I didn't even see (or hear) this jet when I took the photo, but the camera captured it in incredible detail.<br />In another case, I shot a photo of the night sky, with several stars and what I knew as the planet Saturn in the frame (I also like astronomy).  Fair enough, when I looked at the picture on my monitor I did see the dots of light surrounded by blackness.  However, zooming in on captured twinkle of Saturn, I actually was able to resolve the rings at high magnification, something I have never been able to do with the naked eye!  Pretty amazing.<br />There are a few cons;  the camera is heavy enough that I'm loathe to use one hand when shooting, as I could with my other camera.  You just don't want to drop it.  The screw-on lens cap is a nice touch to protect the lens, but couldn't they have figured out a way for the lens to unscrew itself and pop the lens cap when powered on?  I hate having to unscrew it every time.  In addition, in very bright sunlight, this camera tended to overexpose in Auto mode.  You should learn the different settings to make your shooting effective under these conditions.  I should also mention that this camera is not kind if you have a blemish or scars or any other item you usually find unnoticeable in other photo's.  The high pixel count gives you a very very large and sharp amount of detail, and you may find yourself wishing you had washed your face after the marinara if you are not careful.<br />Although not a \"con\" per se, but worth mentioning, is that the G2's Jpeg files are very large, the RAW mode files even larger on average (although not as large as TIFF - thanks Canon)!  In just a few weeks of ownership, and a few hundred photo's, I managed to gather enough pictures to fill two 700MB CDR's.  This is more than I have filled in three years in the highest quality mode on my trusty old 1.2MP camera.  Be forwarned - you will have to archive much more often.<br />If you are considering this camera, I cannot recommend it enough.  You would not regret buying one, even at the almost 800 dollar price.","...<br />I see three major differences when reviewing cameras. That is what sold me on the G2, not the accolades of digital photography.<br />1. Speed. I read a lot about how long it takes to resolve a photo to its digital form. I have yet to snap a photo where the feedback on the display is there before I can lay my eyes on it. Does it need to be faster than that?<br />2. Battery life. I recharge my battery each day, so I have not tested it for endurance. I bought a backup and a 2-battery dc charger. So far, they have not been required. I am running around showing the camera to my friends and co-workers, running the display while they gawk at my first attempts at digital photography. There have been no warnings about low batteries or much of a perceivable dent in the display after carrying around my camera with me all day at work. (yes, and I even get a lot of that done too boss!)<br />3. I hear a lot about photo quality. I have a friend that purchased a Nikon, and know a few others. They all mention red-eye, just as the reviews do. I really did not want to deal with that.<br /><br />And the fun stuff is great. When I get home, I spend a little time setting up the downloads to the albums I created for digital prints...<br />The G2 has so many features, I decided to wade into the world of digital rather than try and learn it all at once. It is helping. I find myself asking questions about how to do this or that with a print. I get the book out and now I am applying what I learn while doing it...<br />There are no disappointments where I wish I were working with silver media. The best part is, I can still take digital work and then send it off or take it to a good camera store and have the image transferred to silver for a print if I want...<br />If I really, really want to keep the photo's. I can burn them to CD-ROM and they will keep better than a negative. No scratching, no fingerprints by well meaning friends, etc.<br />I see a whole New World opening up, and I personally am glad I chose the G2 doorway.<br />There are others, and I will let those owners speak for themselves. As far as myself, I am very happy with the camera. I expect to find new things I can do with the camera for a long time. Why did I wait so long to get started.<br />By the way, I purchased the black model in a kit. It is a little more, but I like that too. You get a traditional leather carry case to protect the camera while carrying. Also there is a 96 Meg compact flash card included. That makes it a pretty good deal...","The G2 was the third digital camera I bought and it immediately made the other two totally obsolete. It's not a conventional 35mm SLR camera but this thing is so close I am still amazed. Picture quality (for a digital) is superb! The battery pack is long-lasting, allowing you to take an endless parade of pictures before needing a recharge (and I have a 256 meg card in mine). The camera has sufficient weight to feel solid but is quite compact. And it's the first digital camera that I've actually had luck with the red-eye reduction feature. The 3X optical zoom is a blessing when you want to zoom in on something and still retain great clarity (digital zoom creates a grainy picture)and I've captured some fascinating pictures with the macro feature that allows you to get in close for detail shots or capturing the small things in the world. The different shooting modes make picture taking nearly fool-proof but the camera is flexible enough to allow you to be \"creative\" if and when you want to be.<br />The movie feature allows you to capture \"mini\" movies of 30 second duration. Though the movie picture is small and grainy (compared to its regular shooting modes), it's a great little feature for capturing those spur-of-the-moment things.<br />Improvements I'd like to see are faster focusing, shorter processing time, and shorter start-up time (program load-up) but these things are minor and can be overcome by simply knowing what to expect as I grow more accustomed to the camera's \"personality.\"<br />Am I happy with the G2?  No.  I'm ecstatic!  It was worth every penny of its price. With its great image clarity, great focusing (though it can be a little tricky at times), and countless little features to explore, the Canon Powershot G2 is a heavenly piece of technology that actually exceeded my expectations quite handsomely. And if you're not very familiar with cameras, don't let all the little extras deter you from enjoying this gem because you can use it like a point-and-click (with focusing) until you're ready to explore its more advanced features.<br />In short, this G2 is a sweet digital camera!","I am a serious amateur photographer who has been holding out for higher resolution digital cameras.  I bought this camera for my snapshot photography and am so impressed with the 8x10s I am getting, I probably won't go back to my film based system.  It is great to not have the hassle of getting slides processed, sorting them on the light table and then getting suitable prints made.<br />I will eventually get a Canon D60 body for my EOS lenses, but for now, I am having too much fun with the G2.","This camera has everything that my 35mm has plus all of the digital-features you could hope for and more! All of the features are ergonomically placed in all of the right places for accessing features on the fly, such as the zoom, or switching between different modes.  The quality of the pictures are what will blow you away!  The images seem to burst out of the screen they are so crisp and clear!  4 megs is definitely worth the extra $100 - 200!!  Canon, in my opinion, is among the very best in digital photography companies.  They were quick to answer a question I had when I called their customer service.<br />One thing I was disappointed about when I received my new G2 was that it was quite large and heavy.  I had never seen it in person before I ordered it (which is my own fault) but I now believe that if I did, I might have opted for the sleeker S40 which is almost have the weight and has a retractable lens.  But as long as you know what you're getting, then the G2 is the best camera as far as features are concerned.  The other gripe I have is the focusing.  When you line up the shot and look at the lcd screen to see how well you are in focus before shooting, it does NOT accurately show if the shot is in focus or not.  The actual picture you shoot will turn out GREAT, but you don't know that until you actually have taken the picture.  That is quite a substantial limitation for a semi-pro/pro who needs to know instantly if the shot is going to be in focus or not.<br />Bottom line is that if you want a high-quality 4 meg digital camera, then this is the camera for you.  Just beware that you won't be able to carry it around in your shirt pocket like some other digicams! ...","This is a great camera, with wonderful features.  BUT...The red-eye reduction system does not work.  Instead of flashing twice, as most cameras do, the G2 projects a \"bright\" beam a light while you focus on your subject.  This beam is not bright enough to constrict the pupils in the first place, and is not wide enough to even hit the pupils in a typical composition.  You have to attempt to flash the beam in the subjects' eyes before taking the picture--very difficult to impossible.<br /><br />For this price, and considering all of the advanced features, I would expect better.  I cannot recommend this camera because of this egregious flaw.<br /><br />Canon G2 Owners: Please complain to Canon if this bothers you--maybe it could be fixed with a software upgrade.","I did a lot of research before choosing to purchase this digital camera and I have to say it has already exceded my high expectations.  It's a complete joy to use and the pictures come out beautifully.  I have been printing them out on a canon S900 printer and the results are amazing.  I could not be more impressed with this camera.  Definitely worth the price!","This camera takes incredible photos and they print awesome with my HP desk jet. Even better when taken into a shop with a good photo printer. I took a picture if a rose after a rain at close range and could see the viens of the rose thru the rain droplets on the rose. It's worth every penny.","Camera Body, Compact Power Adapter CA-560, Lithium-Ion Battery Pack BP-511, Neck Strap NS-DC100, Wireless Controller WL-DC100, USB Interface Cable IFC-200PCU, AV Cable AVC-DC100, Lens Cap, 32MB CompactFlash Card with case, Adobe PhotoShop 5.0 LE, Apple QuickTime 5.0, ZoomBrowser EX 2.8 (for PC) and ImageBrowser 1.8 (for Mac), PhotoRecord 1.2.4 (Windows only), PhotoStitch 3.1, RAW Image Converter 1.1, RemoteCapture 2.0 (enables Canon G2 camera to be controlled by a computer), User's Guide, Software Starter Guide, System Map, Canon U.S.A., Inc. Limited Warranty.<br />The design of the Canon PowerShot G2 is based on the popular PowerShot G1, with an elegant champagne metallic coverplate and an enlarged handgrip for better ergonomics. The Canon G2 has many features in common with its predecessor, including a superbly sharp high-speed 7-21mm f/2.0-2.5 zoom lens (equivalent to 34-102mm in the 35mm format), a Vari-Angle LCD viewfinder, a conventional camera body design, a high-speed plug-and-play USB interface, compatibility with Canon EX-series Speedlite flash units, and compatibility with Type I and II CompactFlash memory cards, including IBM's series of Microdrives.<br />Equipped with a 1/1.8-inch, 4.0 megapixel CCD sensor, the Canon PowerShot G2 allows users to produce full-color, high-resolution images up to 2272 x 1704 pixels. The camera also offers three additional resolution settings of 1600 x 1200, 1024 x 768 and 640 x 480. The added resolution helps users to produce sharper enlargements with finer detail than is possible with 3.3 megapixel cameras. For maximum flexibility, the Canon PowerShot G2 provides users with a selection of 13 image quality settings including 3 JPEG compression modes (Superfine, Fine and Normal) at any resolution. It also features Canon's exclusive RAW mode for maximum control over image attributes such as white balance, contrast, sharpness, saturation and bit depth without image-degrading artifacts. By combining the G2's RAW file capabilities with its optional ISO 50 sensitivity setting, users can achieve higher image quality than any competitive model on the market today. The Canon PowerShot G2 uses RGB primary color filters on the CCD chip for maximum color reproduction accuracy. This feature, together with proprietary noise reduction and digital signal processing, works behind the scenes to deliver top-notch image quality that's unique to Canon.","Ok, don't bother reading if you only use...pro digital cameras. This is for enthusiasts, who want VERY good, sharp, detailed pictures, with lots of ability to control the camera for great manual shots, as well as great automatic ones as well...I love it. It is easy to use, heavy enough to feel sturdy, and is allowing me to truly discover photography, while not babying me through it. You can set EVERYTHING manually - exposure, ISO, Shutter speed, focus, aperture, light level, white balance, saturation, etc, etc. I have taken some wonderful photos, and am starting to really enjoy venturing away from auto into the semi-manual modes. Not to mention the stitching capability for panoramas is unmatched. Fabulous camera, I've had great experience printing photos onto an Epson 820...even using the reduced size (medium) setting produces photo-quality, (NO visible dots, indistinguishable from film) pictures on glossy photo paper.","After many helpful reviews off the NET and hands on testing in many stores - I am very happy with this product. So easy to use. The build quality is top notch, performace is very quick when taking pictiures and reviewing them PLUS the controls are so intutive. Images are razor sharp!<br /><br />Camera also comes with a little remote cntrol!!!!!<br /><br />Sell your old stuf and get this one!! You won't be dissapointed!","The CANON G2 4MP digital camera is one of the best compact digital cameras on the market in this time.It is very easy to use and learn how digital photography can be easy and helpfull for everybody.This camera gives you a comfort what you can not find on most professiobnals SLR cameras.I have this camera by my own and really filled my expectations.Is perfect for family and vacation pictures.I would recommend this camera for everybody who did not try digital camera yet and also for people who owns already digital camera.I woul not recommend this camera for taking wild life pictures.As a every digital camera this camera is much slower then SLR cameras.You should think for what kind of purpose do you want to use it.I did not found better digital camera on the market in this class in this time.","There is something about this camera, and its hard to say what exactly, that makes it a joy to use and its owners fiercely loyal.  I bought the black body in a kit that came with a sporty real leather wrap-around case and a 96Mb compact flash card to go along with the 32Mb card the camera body came with.  This was a great deal at only about fifty dollars over the normal camera price.<br />To begin with, the camera looks and handles like a classic camera, which is what none of the other 4 or 5 megapixel cameras can boast, with the exception of the Leica Digilux 1.  It has heft and controls which please the eyes and fingers of dyed in the wool 35mm photographers like myself.<br />Secondly, it delivers on image quality.  Check the stats from the photography magazines and online camera reviews.  The G2 comes out on top every time in its category, period.  Sharpness, color accuracy, and contrast are all excellent.<br />Thirdly, Canon delivers superb software with their product.  Zoombrowser EX is a well thought-out program that allows the user to group, sort, modify, print or show slides of images with ease.  It also coordinates well with Adobe Photoshop (a full version of which Canon also supplies!).<br />Lastly, there are the little things that make a photographer happy if they are present in a digital camera and sad if they are absent.  Happily they are all present in the G2:  long, long battery life; excellently sharp and fast autofocus; accurate evaluative metering; manual override of autofocus; manual exposure control; the ability to add filters and other lenses (close-up, wide angle and tele); the truly wonderful swiveling LCD screen; and the ability to attach an accessory flash.<br />Is this camera perfect?  Of course not, but I think it is the closest thing to an instant classic the digital world has come up with and will still be used by its happy adherents when its contemporaries have hit the ash can long ago.<br />I am a faithful Nikon 35mm camera buff (using the F5 and N80 bodies extensively), but I crossed the line on this one baby! Check out all the reviews of its competitors.  None of them compare.","This is a camera for everyone.  Simple operation, ample accessories and extra features usually offered on only much more expenxive cameras.<br />-- Can be used with or without viewfinder.<br />-- 4.0 MP provides miraculous images!<br />-- Movie mode for 30 second clips is fabulous.<br />-- Easy data transfer to PC.<br />-- Self-photo timer is fabulous!<br />-- Excellent value.<br />-- Compact Flash Media format is so easy to use, not to mention convenient!<br />In conclusion, there is not a better digital camera on the market, at any price!","This is not a camera for the \"point and shoot\" crowd.  It has P&S capabilities, but this camera is designed for the serious photographer-- the manual controls and creative options are where this camera stands out from the competition.<br />The Canon Powershot G2 4MP packs loads of manual and semiautomatic adjustment and focusing control features into a relatively compact (it's somewhat boxy) and reasonably priced package.<br />In addition to the standard features on would expect-- 4.1 megapixel sensor that creates 2,272 x 1,704 images for prints at 8 x 10 and beyond,  3x optical (plus 3.6x digital) zoom lens with autofocus,  a 32 MB CompactFlash card that holds 24 images at default resolution; Microdrive compatibility, USB port connections, etc., the G2 has some unique features, such as a swiveling LCD that allows you to point the screen up, down, sideways-basically in the same direction as the lens, whatever direction that may be.  This is handy for self portraits or when using the remote (which is included with the camera).<br />Two video formats have also been included, allowing for 30 and 120 seconds of moving images with audio. Slow shutter-speed mode allows extended exposures in low-light situations. (A a NTSC cable for connecting to a television set is also included.)<br />Also, the included software package goes beyond standard image processing with a remote capture function that allows complete control and manipulation of the camera functions from your computer keyboard. Canon's Stitch Assist program allows you to combine up to four images into one, seamless, panoramic view.<br />The rechargeable BP-511 lithium-ion battery pack is exceptional.  I got over 340 shots on one charge-just amazing.  The battery and recharger are included with the camera.<br />If heavy use of manual features is your thing-this is your camera.  If \"point & shoot\" is your thing-get a less expensive camera. With the G2 you'll just be paying for capacity and capabilities you'll never use or appreciate.","I owned a G2 for over 6 months.  After taking over 4,200 pictures, I am still amazed by what this camera can do.  I use this for my wedding photography business and my clients are all very happy with the prints from the G2.  The picture quality is excellent, I printed many 8X10 photos and seen many jaws dropped when I told them that is from a digital camera.<br />If you are serious about indoor photography, an external flash is a must.  The Canon 420EX is an excellent companion to the G2.<br />The G2 is not perfect, there is room for improvement.  The G2 could use a better and faster low light focusing system.  The manual focus could be made better with a focusing ring.  Faster shutter response time would be nice too.  Overall, the G2 is an excellent camera that I would recommend.  If you want a simple point and shoot, the G2 might be an overkill.  However, if you are an amaturer photographer, this is the camera for you.","If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I wouldn't belive it.Being a hard nose Nikon user for years and being the owner of a Nikon professional digital camera that accepts all my AF-D lenses,I was hesitant to purchase a Canon product. I wanted a smaller,more portable digital camera for candids and travel shots. Thinking that for the price of the Canon G2 I might get a pretty good snapshot camera,I went ahead and ordered one.<br />Let me tell you I was suprised and very pleased with my very first images out of the G2. The lense is sharp and contrasty and gives my Contax/Zeiss lenses a run for their money. This is an excellent camera, especially for the money. One could probably pay 3 times as much for another 4MP camera and not get the great results offered by the Canon G2. If you don't have one-get one!","This camera has amazed me for its robust constitution, i[ve even take it to the jungle and altough it got a little wet in the river it has been working without any problems, giving me excelent and high quality pictures. The only feature i wasnt satisfied with was the autofocus wich wasnt enough quick sometimes.","Just a great digital camera!  I did lots of research before buying and have been very impressed.  This camera has lived up to every expectation.  It takes phenomenal photos.  Whether printed by Ofoto or on your own printer, you can't find any flaws, even up to 16x20.  The images are crystal clear.  No grain as in regular cameras.  I've owned Canon 35mm cameras for years and love the quality.  This is no exception.  It does take a little while to learn how to use, but nothing prohibitive.  The photo stitch feature in the supplied software is awesome.  All you do is select the pictures and the software does the rest.  I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this.  I have friends who have Fuji's and Nikon's in this price range and they are very jealous of the quality of images generated with the G2.","I have tried three different cameras in the last three weeks. This is by far the best that I've tried. I don't know a lot about cameras. I just know when the pictures look good. I bought the Sony S-85 because the reviews were so great. Well, I think if I knew what I was doing then maybe I could have made it work. But I could never get the white balance right. My little girl's face always looked green (but this could be just me not knowing what I was doing also).  And then I tried the Kodak 4900 that is suppose to be 4MP also. Well, the resolution was just not there on this camera. The color looked good, but the resolution was worse than the 3MP camera that I tried (maybe that's why it's so much cheaper). And the other camera was a Sony also, but it was a 3MP, and you can't really compare that one to this one at all. So, I've decided on this one, and I have taken some great shots. I have three kids so it's hard getting them into focus sometimes (I'm using autofocus also), but when I do, the pictures are great. They look better than my old film camera, and the color is excellent. The Canon has so many manual options that I think is just great. I don't know what most of them do right now, but I will find out. And the movie mode is very nice too. You need to buy a bigger compact flash card though, but you need to on all the cameras really if you want to you use the highest resolution. Well, I guess all I can say is that I really love this camera, and I've tried three.","I've had my Canon Powershot G2 4MP Digital Camera for about 3 months now and I am completely in love.  This is my 3rd Digital Camera and I think I will be using this camera for years to come.  This camera package includes the beautiful 4.0 Mega-pixel Canon PowerShot G2 camera, 32MB CompactFlash card, lithium-ion rechargeable battery, AC Adapter, wireless remote control, neck strap, lens cap w/strap, USB cable, A/V cable along with software and manual.<br />4 Megapixel settings on the camera allows you to take pictures that look just as a good as a traditional 35 mm high quality camera.  The camera can be set to 4 different resolutions with a maximum resolution of 2272 x 1704 and the minimum resolution of 640 x 480.  You can store the images captured in JPEG or RAW format, which is better than the traditional TIFF format.  Canon does include software that will allow you to convert the RAW format.<br />The camera accepts both Type I and Type II CompactFlash memory cards. A 32MB card is included which will allow for about 10-15 pictures in the highest resolution setting.  I instantly sprang for a SanDisk 256 MB CompactFlash Card and the Sandisk Imagemate CompactFlash Card Reader (SDDR-31) to download the pictures from the card directly vs. using the camera's USB connector.  The camera is also microdrive compatible, but I haven't had an opportunity to try that yet.  The prices for 1 GB microdrives are around $300.00 which makes it a really attractive accessory for this camera.<br />The 3x optical zoom lens gives you a 35mm equivalent focal length of 34 to 102mm.  Another thing I love about this camera is the tilt-and-swivel LCD that's included.  The LCD twits around completely that will allow you to take some of the over-the-head, backwards, impossible shots.  One of the best features about this camera is its battery consumption or the lack thereof.  I took over 200 pictures indoors with flash in one sitting and I still had plenty of juice left into the battery.  I could have shot for another 2 hours, but I ran out of CF cards.  The G2 also has a full TTL hot-shoe built onto the top of the camera to add another flash.  The bottom of the camera includes a tripod mount.<br />The true camera geeks will be happy with all the possible exposure modes available on the camera.  Starting with the automatic exposure mode to complete granular control that the SLR provides, this camera will make everyone happy.  The scene exposure modes allow for presets to take portraits, pan-focus, landscape, and night-scene.  If you get this camera, you have to try to use the included Photo Stitch software to take those truly breathtaking panoramic pictures.<br />In conclusion, this is a great camera that will give you years of great service and take fabulous pictures.  The only complaint I would have about this camera was the connectivity on my XP computer.  The camera includes a USB cable and software that is supposed to allow you to download the pictures from the camera directly, but I was getting some weird connectivity errors.  Since I already had the Sandisk CF card reader, I never tried to get this connectivity working.  But a lot of other people have this working and so this shouldn't be an issue for anyone.","I am very pleased with this camera. It takes great pictures and gives you as much control over the picture as you need. It's very easy to use, whether your a novice or a more seasoned photographer.<br />I gave it a four instead of five for two reasons. The first is the lack of an external charger. The battery for this camera can only be charged in the camera. This makes having two batteries less useful since you can't charge one while using the other. Unless of course you want to spend even more money on the external charger. The second reason is when using the extension for use with filters and other lenses you can get a very bad shadow in the lower right hand corner of the picture from the extension. Of course, there is a way to correct this, purchase an external flash for the camera, which it can use. ... This is less of an issue than the first, but I have found it to be a problem on more than one occasion.<br />One last thing; if your looking for a camera for Astrophotography, digital is NOT the way to go. Stick with 35mm SLR cameras. You can't get the exposures necessary for good astrophotography with digital cameras. The technology just isn't there yet.<br />Good luck and enjoy the camera, if you purchase it. You won't regret it, I sure don't.","I've owned my G2 for about 6 months now.  All I can say is that I've lent my 35mil camera and all its lenses out, and I'm not hassling the person to get them back.<br />I've coupled my G2 with a 512M compact flash card, an extra battery (pricey) and an Epson Photo 780 printer.  What an incredible combination.  Photo marts, eat your heart out.  I can shoot 220-230 of the highest resolution photos on this card (It'll take both batteries to do that however)and bring them home, pour over them in Adobe, choose the ones I want, Bingo bango off to the printer they go.<br />The photo quality that you can get with this combination is stellar.  I'm not being sarcastic when I say you will NOT be able to tell that these aren't traditional film photos.  (note to those of you attempting this, in Adobe when you resize photos, ensure that you turn off the image resampling...)<br />The colour renderin by this camera is nigh' on perfect.  I tend do be a \"priority\" type of photographer (You know, Aperature or Shutter speed), but with this camera, it seems intuitively in tune with what I want to do.  I almost always just end up shooting in auto mode now.<br />I could go on and on, but why?  Suffice it to say, if you can muster the money to buy this camera, it's well worth your time.","The Cannon G2 is one of the best, easy, most affordable in terms of quality and options that I have ever owned! Granted a few years down the road and others will surpass it, but it will still hold it's own with the newer bigger mega pixel camaras without a doubt. The battery life is excellent, Takes great shots on auto, and if you go manual your in for a treat!!! Really, in my opinion it gives you the best for the $$$ look around before you pick one up, I've seen differences of over 200 smackers on the web. Like I said, It's one excellent camara, if you can afford it, get it! If not, then save for one. You won't be disappointed.","I am a long-time digital camera user, having owned a Kodak DC-265 (which I gave away only recently) and a Sony Mavica CD1000 (which I still use for its excellent 10x optical zoom). Until recently, I also owned a wonderful 35mm Canon EOS Rebel 2000 film camera with grip extender and a Canon Speedlite flash (which works with both the EOS and the Powershot G2 -- one reason I bought the G2!). I'm in love with digital since most of my work ends up on my wildtexas.com website or emailed to family and friends.<br />I own a 1 gigabyte IBM Microdrive (Compact Flash II) and one of my criterion for purchasing a new digicam was that it supported this format, since I have many different Compact Flash media thanks to my years in digital photography and my interest in Pocket PC PDAs. Since this is a 4 megapixel camera, I'd recommend at *least* a 128 MB CompactFlash card or greater.<br />When my G2 arrived in the mail, I was very pleasantly surprised to discover it was such a sturdy little camera -- heavier than I imagined, but stronger as well. One of the things I dislike about my Mavica is it's so big and bulky -- awkward to hold. The G2, in contrast, is smooth, streamlined and solid in a built-to-last kind of way. I took photos with it at an airshow recently, using the ingenious flip-around viewscreen as I shot the camera over my head (due to crowd obstructions). While the camera got heavy in my hand over time, it let me take shots I would never have been able to manage with my Mavica -- and the videos, while not feature-film worthy were perfect for web use and sharing with friends (the sound recorded is particularly good!)<br />One caveat, and this is for all camera owners (both digital and 35mm) -- buy a good camera case to protect your investment! Lowe Pro bags are perfect for folks who spend a lot of time outdoors, like I do, since many of their bags have attached Gore-Tex rain hoods. The G2 fits perfectly in the Lowe Pro D-Res 30 bag I own, with plenty of room to spare for accessories.<br />The battery life is superb. As an example, I went to the airshow with my Mavica CD1000 and my Powershot G2 fully charged. After taking 15 second videos and some stills for about 30 minutes, my Mavica's battery died. I then switched exclusively to shooting with my G2, and it lasted not only for the 4 more hours we were at the airshow, but also through an entire additional day of off-and-on usage; it still had juice in it when I decided it was a good time to start recharging in, in preparation for our next outing. It's a digital photographers and webmaster's dream come true!<br />I highly recommend getting the largest storage card you can afford and shooting all your images in RAW mode. While this makes downloads to your computer take longer, it ensures you have the HIGHEST quality digital images possible, giving you maxiumum opportunities to do things like get big reprints from a pro lab. With my Microdrive and all RAW images, plus video clips, I still never worry about how much memory I have left.<br />Another bonus of the G2 being so solidly built is I have much less worries about my delicate Microdrive getting harmed when in the camera as I used to when the drive lived in my PDA. The Microdrive is well protected in the G2's body, versus being relatively exposed (with just a flimsy plastic cover) when I used it in my PDA. There's even a CF card eject button, thus eliminating the fear of Microdrive owners far and wide about harming their cards when removing them.<br />Fantastic camera for a worthy price!","Try'm I did, 5 different digital cameras, and ended up with the Canon G2.  2, 3.3, 3.9, 4, 5 mega pixal, I tried 'em<br />Oh I did keep 1 of the other 5, the Nikon 995, primarly for the extra wide angle lens, and the extra focal length of the telephoto. And besides after all these years (a Nikon Man) I can't jump ship at this stage of life.<br />I do believe though that when I jump back into this thing w/both feet it will be the Canon EOS D60<br />Oh the G2 ain't in any matter of the e-magination perfect, but ask youself, what is?<br />But give'em credit there trying.","Excellent camera. I also have an Olympus D-460 this to for a 1.3 meg camear was excellent. Felt I wanted a little more power and after looking into the various products, I felt the G2 gave me a lot more options. So far it is great","I did a lot of looking and when all was said and done, this is the camera for a novice like me, and a pro like my friend who is a photographer by profession. He put up with my fear of the G2 being too high tech, and as soon as he played with the G2, in a store, he told me that it was the one for me and for him too.<br />The Auto mode is perfect for 95% of my pictures and that is great as I am still learning the enhancements that are in the G2. The battery life is unbelievable and with the 126MB card, that Amazon.com had at a great discount, I can take 250+ pictures in the 2nd resolution setting. The manuals, camera and software, are great and it is nice having them as an individual and not all in one, much easier to work with. The pictures are excellent and the swing out viewfinder is just something you need to see to believe. It makes everything much easier, expecially viewing and editing the pictures. Take it from a novice this is the camera to grow into, but while growing, get lots and lots of use. It is pure enjoyment, and every one loves the picture quality....","This is my first experience with a digital camera.  Like so many others, I've been unable to accept the proposition that a digital camera would ever be able to compete with my 35mm.  I'm happy to report that the G2 produces images even at the simplest point-and-shoot setting that are so perfect- even cropping and blowing them up to 8X10-sized prints proves perfection (I certainly could not tell one from a 35mm image handled in exactly the same fashion.)  The picture stitching feature for creating panoramic images is first-time easy and fun- I only wish I'd had this the last time I visited the Grand Canyon.<br />With the exception of the \"movie mode\" which is absolutely useless (don't buy the camera specifically for this \"feature\", as it produces laughable images that would not even be suitable as email attachments), I love everything about the G2.  I noticed something about this camera (and probably ALL digital cameras) that I wanted to share.<br />I am lucky enough to have 2 different PC setups in my home.  The one I currently use is a high-tech DELL Dimension with a large trinitron monitor.  When I download images from the G2 to this system, I find the time very fast, and the images look wonderful without the slightest need to tweek them.  As an experiment, I tried downloading the same images to the \"off-the-shelf average\" Hewlett Packard PC and monitor that I started out with, and my whole experience seemed different.  It took what seemed like a long time to download, and the images looked fuzzy, poor color, etc.  If I had not already seen the beautiful G2 images on my DELL equipment, I would have returned the camera for taking \"lousy\" photos, without ever having bothered to try to print them up.  I point this out as I think some people blame the digital camera for the \"looks\" of the initial image, when they may just be looking at them with a \"not so great\" PC and monitor.  Make sure you print your photos on a good machine, with quality paper.<br />The other thing I wanted to share was regarding \"after the purchase\" customer support.  This being my first digital camera, I had lots of new user questions.  I've called the Canon 800 customer support number several times, and each time I was helped by a kind and knowledgeable person who was able to answer my question(s) quickly and thoroughly in terms I could easily understand.  One has to go through the usual 3-4 level choice options to get to the digital cameras' support (the norm these days), however I have not once had to sit and wait while listening to elevator music for a human to pick up the call.  Canon gets five stars from me in this area, and for their very wonderful digital camera.  I'm definitely hooked, and glad I decided to make the plunge.","I have been using the G2 for about 4 months purely for recreation/hobby.  In recent years, I have not had the time to really keep up my interest in photograhy.  Waiting for pictures to come back from processor,then reviewing,etc., is a poor second to having your own darkroom, but a darkroom is a big time investment.  With the G2 and Adobe Photoshop Elements I have a combination that has allowed me to produce a very satisfying product with excellent quality.  We have had a digital camera in the family for a couple of years, but the resolution and control just weren't there.  Canon has put together a very powerful package covering an excellent range of users and it has the resolution to be competitive with film.  It will make great pix in full automatic, but if you are interested in more control over the operataion, you can find lots of knobs to turn. The basic system works fine, but if you can swing it, a larger memory card and an external flash are good investments.  The purists will say (correctly) that film is still premier media for resolution and results, but digital is now good enough for quality work, and a whole lot easier and faster for reviewing results.","My wife gave me this camera for Christmas (after I dropped a few hints here and there). It's an outstanding camera! Takes great pictures, is easy to use (I was taking pictures within 5 minutes of receiving it), and has more features than I have figured out yet. I would however, suggest getting an additional compactflash memory card. The standard 32MB one is decent, but it only allows you 24 pictures. You can always adjust it to take 54 medium quality pictures which is better than the high quality settings on lower cameras, but it is easy to get spoiled. A camera case is also a good idea as it doesn't come with one, and you'll love it too much to risk it getting damaged.","The Canon PowerShot G2 is a digital camera consumer's dream come true, and a nightmare for other digital camera manufacturers.<br />Make a list of features you'd expect and not expect to find from a \"prosumer\" digital camera, and chances are you'll find them on the G2. This is a little camera that was designed to act a lot bigger than many other digital cameras in its class.<br />You only have to pick up a G2 to realize that there's a lot more to it than meets the eye; this camera's significantly heavier and feels sturdier than any other camera in its class! The extra weight means better camera stabilization. The G2's sturdiness inspires confidence and makes the camera feel like a photographic tool, not an electronic gizmo.<br />From the tilt-and-swivel LCD, the magnification loupe for manual focusing, dedicated and fully functional flash hot-shoe, evaluative metering, IR autofocous assist mechanism, ISO 50, RAW image format, etc., etc., this camera has it all!.<br />Many photographers will argue that the real measures of any camera lie in the controls and results. The G2 doesn't disappoint in either of these respects. Although you'll have to familiarize yourself with the camera's controls initially, you'll soon find them very intuitive and actually use them more often than not.<br />The quality of images captured with the G2 is nothing short of superb! You'll get clean, detailed, very high-resolution photographs with the G2, especially if you use the camera's RAW mode at ISO 50.<br />The Canon PowerShot G2 is still a point-and-shoot digital camera. Anyone who's ever used an SLR will miss the optical viewfinder, true manual focus, and lens selection not available in the G2. However, this can be said for any other digital camera in the G2's class. In every other respect, the G2 rises above its inherent limitations and really challenges its competition to try and keep up!<br />Beyond the camera itself, Canon has really done the consumer proud by offering most every accessory that you would want included at no extra charge, i.e. an remote control unit, high-capacity rechargeable Lithium Ion battery, and remote capture software.<br />If you're in the market for a capable digital camera at a reasonable price, thank Canon for making the choice really very simple.<br />Positives:<br />- extensive feature set<br />- excellent build and design<br />- superb results, especially in RAW mode at ISO 50<br />- Excellent lens produces very little distortion and chromatic aberrations<br />- extremely reasonable price<br />- All the accessories that should come standard do come standard.<br />Negatives:<br />- Certain exposure adjustments, i.e. flash compensation, aren't available in full manual mode.<br />- The fact that the G2 isn't an SLR.<br />- Not much else.","This is the best digital camera I have ever had. The pictures are top of the line.I also have a nikon 995 and this one is  better by far. It does far more then I even thought it would and is easy to master.Buy the Canon g2 and you will be very happy.<br />Goodby nikon Hello canon from now on for me anyway.","I got this camera about 2 months ago and I must say that it is the best digital camera I have used or seen. The picture<br />quality is perfect and the colors are true and bright. The only problem I have with it is the manual focus. MF is something you don't always get with a Digacam so I like the fact that Cannon put it in, but it is to hard to use.  All in all if you need a ditial camera then this is the one for you.","The first time I got this, I became very ecstatic about it.  It has a very nice sleek design that looks very cool.  The camera is ergonomically designed, so that's always a plus.  The LCD screen is pretty good, it can rotate a full 270 degress and the quality is not bad.  The first time I hooked it up to my computer, I was amazed as to how CLEAR the pictures actually were.  The detail on every picture is so good that it looks like tv.  There is not one pixel that you can see.  The colors are very nice and matches very accurately.  It also has a Canon 3X lens.  Canon is the premier maker of lens, they have the best lens that any company can offer.  The picture quality is EXCEPTIONAL, you simply can't beat it.  But the controls are a bit cumbersome and hard to use.  This is definitely not a camera for the amateurs.  There are way too many dials and switches on the camera.  You have to spend a good weekend to read the instructions manual before you can actually start shooting the basics.  Disregarding the cumbersome controls, the functions and picture quality is SUPERB.","Finally landed on a digital camera that I can live with.  I'm still waiting for an SLR; the prices are heading this way.  In the meantime, I've got this wonderful camera to work with.  I have used entry level digital cameras, and several peer level models from the competition and Canon has nailed it.  The Olympus and Sony models I owned before this one don't even come close.  Everything about this camera is familiar to an experienced photog, but a novice can pick it up and start shooting without a problem.  Canon clearly benefits from the D30 and EOS 1D being in the field and trickles the technology into this camera.  I have had no issues with it, and the external flash system is 2nd to none.  I have to admit to being a Nikon user for years, but the design of the 950-995 was too off the wall for me, and the CP 5000 appears to be hugely inferior to this camera (slower lens, flash system, highlight blocking).  I honestly wanted to be writing this review for a Nikon, but Canon has won me over.  The G2 feels solid in your hands, the controls are where we would expect them to be, the external flash system integrates seamlessly with the overall function of the camera and is such an upgrade that I wouldn't pass up the chance to use it.  The G2 writes quickly to memory and the battery supplies plenty of power for several hundred shots.  White balance issues of some competing brands is non-existent; contrast, saturation and sharpness can all be adjusted in camera. The RAW image format has potential far beyond the typical JPEG/TIFF arrangement (espceailly if you use Yarc Plus or Breeze  Browser to convert the images).  I am exceedingly pleased with this purchase.","Had an Oly' 1.3 Mega/pixel two years. Did an outstanding job for a point and shoot. However, with a device to show images on a large TV screen the Oly' with only 1.3 M/P just didn't have the \"Umph.\" After much reaserch over six months, opted for the Canon G-2. This is not an \"Open the box and take pictures\" performer but pretty close. Set the selector to \"Auto\" you are ready to go. In this mode the camera does all the thinking.<br />  Printed documentation, outstanding. For a many featured device, found I could gain special affects with a minimum of study.<br />  Optical zoom capability along with digital zoom is great. At high resolution the results are truly remarkable. On our first outing, took 42 shots expecting at best a half dozen \"Keepers.\" Just the opposite, 36 excellent images. The \"Flip out\" viewing screen had me positioning the camera at impossible angles. No more crawling on my belly like a reptile to get close-ups of ground loving flowers.<br />  The software package that comes with the G-2 needs work. Not user friendly. I use the Olympus software to doctor images.<br />  For those who enjoy experimenting with a all the \"Gigoes\" available with this unit will be in hog heaven. I highly recomend the G-2 even for those new to digital imaging if they are willing to do their homework.","We \"adopted\" our Canon Powershot G2 about two months ago-- our verdict so far?  Great camera for the serious digital photographer!  This is our second digital camera...We made the initial switch from our SLR to digital and have never retreated.<br />The Canon G2 is a full-featured digital camera for those of us that love the control you have with a good SLR.  This model has all the manual adjustments for aperature, shutter speed etc., that you might be used to on your film camera.  At the same time, the G2 has many fully automatic settings for simple point and shoot, such as full program mode, macro (close-up), portrait, panarama etc.  In fact, if you are already a Canon SLR owner like us, you'll find many of the same controls you've already grown accustomed to.<br />Features convincing us to purchase this camera over others include a flash hotshoe, rechargeable (in the camera) Lithium Ion battery, a decent sized 32MB Compact Flash Memory card, an excellent quality zoom lens and a really bright, adjustable LCD display.  We also like the ability to switch between various levels of color intensity similar to polarizing and other filters, as well as B&W and sepia.  There are also settings to adjust for different outdoor and indoor conditions such as flourescent and incandescent light.  There are many more!<br />A big surprise was the digital video recorder with sound.  I thought this would be little better than a toy, but the quality of images and audio were amazing.  Having said that, I wouldn't get this in place of a digital video camera, but if you occasionally like to shoot a few frames of video with sound to throw on a webpage it really comes in handy.<br />So far we really haven't found a lot of downsides on this camera.<br />You should pick up a larger compact flash memory card, but that shouldn't be too big of a deal with prices coming down....We shoot at 1600x1200 allowing us 219 exposures to work with.<br />We also bought an additional Lithium Ion battery.  The Canon uses a proprietary battery charged in the camera.  The battery life is excellent allowing you to constantly use the LCD viewfinder and all features for more than a full day of shooting.  However, if you do happen to drain the battery, you'll be out of luck until you can stop somewhere to plug the camera in for a couple of hours.  Two batteries solve that problem....Availability of an external charger would be nice.  Currently Cannon offers an optional charger to use in your car only.<br />The truth is there are so many features on the G2 that I can't write about them all here.<br />If you are in the market for a high quality, full-featured digital camera as a long term investment, on par with your Nikon, Olympus, or Canon SLR film camera, this is the one to get.","I've hesitated making the switch to digital photography because of the stories I've heard about batteries that last 15 minutes before going dead, about the fact that you have to spend hundreds of dollars on storage media (provided that you don't have a laptop computer to immediately download photos) and talk from professional photographers that film is still where it is at if you want high quality shots.<br />The Canon G2 has changed all those perceptions completely.  It is a great camera and I have taken probably close to 600 pictures since I got it less than a month ago. Of those, I've been able to immediately delete one-third of those pictures because of things I didn't like with lighting, closed eyes, etc.  This is something I couldn't do with my SLR camera and thus I will eventually save a lot of money in film developing costs and I will have better quality images.<br />The pictures are incredible.  I compared similar pictures I took with my Canon Elan 7E 35MM SLR (a great camera in its own right) and my Canon G2 digital camera and I think the quality of the latter pictures is better.  Combined with the savings on film and developing and time saved by not having to scan pictures for editing in Photoshop, etc., the choice of going digital is easy.<br />I do recommend that if you get this camera and intend to take indoor shots to get an external flash unit in Canon's EX series.  The flash that comes with the camera gives me significant \"green eye\" when I took pictures of my dogs (a common problem when taking pictures of pets even with film), even with the red-eye reduction activated, but the bounce flash ability of my Canon 380EX Speedlite reduces this problem significantly (the 420EX is the newest in the Speedlite line).<br />Battery life is also not a problem.  I bought two additional batteries when I bought my camera based on the concerns voiced earlier about short life, but even after 600 shots, I am still working off my initial charge.  Granted that almost all my shots were indoors so I'm not sure how much drain there will be due to elements, but I have also taken them with the monitor, so battery life is pretty good.  You probably might want to get a second battery just to be on the safe side.<br />Compact flash cards still can be pricey, but deals can be found where you might be able to get them for a good price and these prices will no doubt come down over time.  Viking Components compact flash cards are very good and fairly inexpensive compared to other brands.  I also think a cheap laptop or an image storage unit whereby you can store the images from the compact flash cards would be a good investment as well, especially if you plan to travel ...<br />The Canon G2 is a great camera for the semi-serious photographer.  Grab one while you can!","This is a great camera! I am no expert; not even an amateur enthusiast. But I do know great pictures when I see them and you will get lots of them from this camera. This is my first digital camera and I am so glad I bought it, the images look like they came from my old 35mm, which is why I spent the extra money to get the 4.0 megapixels.  I hope to get into photography, so I bought a book to learn how to use all the advanced features, but even if you have minimal experience with cameras, you will be able to start using this one right from the start. It is very easy to use.  The 30 sec. video clip feature is very cool too. Buy some glossy paper, and print out on a decent inkjet printer and noone can tell it is from a digital camera.","I've waited for several years until the >4 megapixel cameras arrived in order to have capability to achieve 8x10 inch prints with fine resolution.  I am completely satisfied with the G2.  It allows great flexibility of control as well as macro function.  Although I am still learning the specifics, I would recommend this camera to serious amateurs without hesitation.","First let me be clear: I adore this camera! I have no serious complaints, but only a short list that might be useful to others ...<br />1) The viewfinder is very small and difficult to focus. Using the LCD monitor is the obvious alternative, but costs in battery life.<br />2) The ports for the power and USB cables on the camera are tiny, and I wonder how well they will hold up over years of plugging and unplugging (no problems after about three months, but ...)<br />3) Overall, I would like this camera more if it were about 20% larger. I also own a Canon Rebel EOS G, which is slightly larger, and the controls, buttons, hand grips (etc.) are a little more \"adult sized\" as a result. I think it makes sense to sacrifice the compactness a little on a camera that's as feature-rich as this one.<br />Notwithstanding the above, I love this camera, and would tell anyone considering digital cameras to put this on the short list.","Just received the Canon Powershot G2. 2 words describe this camera.  Absolutely awesome.  Picture quality is incredible.  Ease of us is beyond my expectations.  Instructions are easy to follow.  The only suggestion I can make is that I should have picked this camera up sooner.","Good camara,  however, be careful, it can not put a date stamp (imprint)on your digial *.JPG file.  and I have talked to Canon help line and there is no plan to support it.","I baught this camera on December 2001. I have taken hundred of photos and all photos have a great quality. My first digital camera is KODAK DC4800, and it also has a good quality. But, DC4800 has a short battery life. Now, G2 has a much longer one. Last X'mas, I have a 4 days holiday and I don't need to charge the battery. I love it very much!!!","if you dont just need it for that wedding; if you re a photo amateure; especially if you re a serious one, buy it. simply buy it.","I love this camera - it's got it all...even a battery that lasts forever! It's a great investment to make...all-around excellent quality!","I had been hesitant to enter the digital camera realm, because I thought these things could just not be as good as standard film cameras - I was completely wrong, and the G2 showed me the way!<br />I did not a lot of research and selected the G2 as my entry to digital photography.  This thing is amazing, the pictures are just beautiful.  I don't fool around with the advanced settings much, but there are lots of options for a hard-core photog.  I got a 256MB CF card and can store 220+ photos at 4MP resolution. I love it, and highly, highly recommend it to anyone, casual or semi-serious photographer.","I've had my G2 for about 3 weeks and (thanks to a Big Event) had the opportunity to pump several hundred images into it over a four day period. Once I got used to it, I found it to be a very satisfying replacement for other cameras I've used (SLRs, digital video as replacement for still camera, point and shoot compacts).<br />I especially enjoy taking candids in available light, and this is the first compact camera I've used that actually lets me do this effectively. This is because I have reliable control over the flash and I can review pictures taken in questionable light to see if they worked or not.<br />I also used the G2 on a tripod to make a photographic copy of a large family oil painting, and the results were about what I'd expect from typical 35mm film in the hands of a casual user. I used the \"remote capture\" mode with a laptop, and must say that this mode works, but not as smoothly as you might expect.<br />When using available light, I admit I'm disappointed that the ISO setting maxes out at 400, but in my experience that's usually been enough, especially with an f2.0 lens, and the G2 can generally provide f2.0 (though you lose that maximum opening at longer focal lengths). The G2 gamely tries to take pictures even when the light is a bit too low, and it simply tries to warn you to hold the camera extra-steady.<br />The low-light picture results were comparable to what I achieved with film - some sharp, some blurry, some grainy, often depending on the quality of the lighting. The level of detail I achieved in my JPEGs was comparable to what I'd seen under similar conditions with a good film camera.<br />I often ran the G2 in \"slow motor drive\" mode since this would allow you to take several pictures in a row. Otherwise the camera would pause dramatically between shots as it pushed the previous image onto the compact flash card. In a sense, this was the biggest adjustment I had to make to this camera -- its computer would occasionally go off and do things, leaving the camera insensible to my need to take a picture, and I'd have to wait a second or two for it to catch up with me. The motor drive mode helped minimize this problem.<br />Of course, the digital camera, and the G2 in particular, carries benefits that were only fantasies in the world of film. I installed a 256K CF card, and the thing held HUNDREDS of pictures! And even though I overused the motor drive setting, I could go back and discard the less interesting pictures WITHOUT WASTING FILM. So by the end of my 4-day event, I had already edited out many of the less promising pictures I'd taken.<br />Another G2 shortcoming is that there's no way to change the orientation of a picture stored on the CF card. Even if you tell the camera which way to orient a picture (there's a menu entry), you lose that information if you simply copy the picture off of the CF card. I found that surprising. (For that matter, today's smart camera ought to sense which way is up, and store the image appropriately.)<br />In closing, let me comment on battery usage. I bought a second battery and didn't start using it till the THIRD DAY of shooting! Note that I mostly relied on the viewfinder, and rarely used the flash. But I regularly used the LCD to review and edit the pictures I'd taken. I never plugged in the camera during the entire four days, since I'd already charged up the other battery. So you can push A LOT of pictures through a single battery charge.<br />Plusses: the benefits of digital technology, film-like resolution, lots of control, a relatively fast lens, a usable viewfinder, awesome battery life.<br />Minuses: ISO tops off at 400, the camera's computer can be slow, and you must use separate editing software to orient pictures. But I suspect the G2 is comparable, if not better, than most other digital cameras in these respects.","This is a great product. ...","The only reason I gave a 4 star rather than 5 is that I thought the direction for installing the software were confusing...but I'm only fair at those kind of things, a child of the 60's.<br />  The camera itself is unbeliveable,as are the pixs. Its work well with my HP932. The instructions for the camera are very easy. I use to do black and white developing with my SLR. The G2 feels like a camera, not just something you put in your pocket for a trip. Once your done you can crop, re-color change anything.Yet its light and easy to carry.<br />  But the beauty is the features of the camera. For you old SLR junkies, you can't beat it. It's a CANON. You take 20 shots, then you can dump the pictures you don't want. GO FOR IT. But let you kids install the software.","this is the best digital camera when i compared with others.i am searching daily but its not available in stock","Like many folks out there, I've been looking at digital cameras for well over a year, but the technology and price haven't come together until recently.  Honestly, I was looking at the Oly 4040 more seriously than this because it looked good on paper (specs).  Do yourself a favor - go to a camera store and hold the cameras.  Test drive them.  The Canon was a no-brainer for me.<br />Compact Flash cards are a must.  Fast and convenient.  I picked up an additional 128mb card, and is well worth the investment.  I also picked up the telephoto lens, but in reality, I don't use it much.  Too awkward for the minimal gain.  Don't bother with the digital telephoto - as with most other cameras, it's lame.<br />I've had this camera (G2) since October, and it is absolutely wonderful.  I needed to send pictures in word documents via snail mail to my kid in the military.  I can literally take a picture and have it imbedded in a word document (formatted too)in under 60 seconds.<br />Besides the ease of use, the pictures are on par with most 35mm shots.  This has full EOS style programs, so it's very versatile and easy to setup.  My friends and family are really impressed with the quality of the black and white and sepia photos it produces.  I really like the auto-bracketing feature.<br />The LCD is very nice in all lighting conditions.<br />You can avoid the startup chime by starting the camera with the LCD closed, and open it after it wakes up.<br />I have saved just over 600 photos to date.  Battery life is phenomenal.  As in WOW!  Excellent!  I've charged twice (approximately 700 pics taken).<br />It's slightly heavy, which I like.  Good feel to the camera (unlike others on the market).<br />I would also highly suggest that you get a CF card reader.  I have a SimpleTech FlashLink, and like it a lot.<br />This camera is extremely easy to use.<br />Don't hesitate, this is a great camera.  You won't regret it.","This is a great camera for a budding digital photography enthusiast, somebody wanting a capable prosumer camera that you can \"grow into\".  It is simple to use (in full auto mode), yet highly capable (full manual controls).  I've done quite a bit of research into all the 3-4 Mega pixel cameras and I believe I had made the right choice in selecting the G2.<br />Some things I liked about this camera:<br />1.  Great LCD display.  I liked the capability of being able to close the lcd display, something other cameras didn't have.<br />2.  Great batteries.  The Li Ion batteries last a long time, and can be charged in camera, like a typical camcorder (very convenient).<br />3.  Easy to use controls.  The controls are intuitive and easy to learn.  I was shooting away in no time.<br />4.  Good software.  I like the included Zoombrowser software that made it easy to organize and view your pictures.<br />5.  Good manuals.  Manuals are very informative and well-written.<br />6.  Very low shutter lag.  One problem with other digital cameras out there is the long shutter delay (delay from the time you press the shutter to the time the picture is taken).  The Canon G2 is FAST!<br />7.  Slew of features.  It has a whole range of modes, starting from point-and-shoot automatic to full manual controls.  I use primarily the \"program AE\" mode which is the point and shoot automatic mode, but with the capability of making exposure, flash intensity, and white balance mode changes.  Great learning camera.<br />8.  Excellent picture quality.  Of course, all the above wouldn't amount to much if the camera yielded poor pictures.  I'm very happy with my G2.<br />Two things that can be improved upon:<br />1.  More optical zoom.  The G2 has 3X.<br />2.  Better flash.<br />However, the G2 has convenient connections for an external lens, and an external flash...","as being a viewer only i can say it is handy hardware,and of course it is truethfull as long as canon made before","This is an easily-to-use camera combining the power to select specific shooting modes as in quality 35mm cameras, but also allowing the user to simply point-and-shoot.  Allows you to save your specific 'settings' even when others use point-and-shoot mode.  Love the panorama, and splice software.","An hour after getting the camera, I was taking pictures. Easy to operate. Downloading fast and simple using usb or card reader. I purchased a epson 1280 for printing, and the results are breathtaking, in color or black and white.  Also bought the cp-10 card printer, very cool, prints credit card size pics in a minute.  The battery life is great and I can take 110 pics on 128 mb flash card. Other bonus, takes short digital movies, great to email to family. This is a vey well thought out camera, if its in your budget, buy it.","This camera is wonderful! I take pictures of my kids and noticed alot of red eye, so I purchased a flash for it, problem solved. I took 246 pictures with the LED on and used the flash on half of these photos. All on one charge. Battery is great. Pictures are studio quality. I print them with an Epson 1280 I reccomend this printer also. Looking forward to getting more technical, which this camera will allow. Happy picture taking.","First of all, if you compare the G2 to other cameras, check out the bundle of stuff in the G2 package; you'll probably find that this camera prices out just above the cost of a 2 or 3 meg camera after adding accessories like battery charger, batteries, USB card reader, which those other cameras most likely don't have.  The G2 has it all, although an additional 64 Meg memory card is advisable as is a carrying case.  A 64 meg card should allow between 30 and 90 shots in the high-res range; thats a whole day's worth of shots.<br />The G2 is very easy to learn to use and I've gotten great images. Overall, I really enjoy the slide-like color intensity when digital images appear on a large PC screen.  For that reason alone, I am finished with 35mm SLRs & print film.<br />Indoor shots have been very impressive; I didn't expect it to be as good. I mostly take outdoor shots and so far I've been pleasantly surprised at the dig-cam's ability to pick up the subtle shadings in the natural world.  Thats my thing; I look for color and texture contrast virtually anywhere in the natural world.  I feel the digital camera does a better job of getting  subtleties of color than my 35mm SLRs did; a shocking thing to say, no doubt. Also, this camera has performed well in a variety of lighting conditions.  On a recent walk in the high Sierra, I got amazingly good G2 images with no special fussing with camera settings; it was fully on auto.  My 35mm SLRs NEVER seemed able to get that high altitude light quality captured.<br />Then there's the quick-turnaround time.  With the USB connection, 30 to 50 high resolution shots can be downloaded to a PC in about 2 minutes, and they're ready to play with.  The bundled Adobe software is very good, and a lot of fun.<br />All around, a pretty cool deal and a truly fun toy !","We purchased this camera to replace an old 35mm Point and shoot Minolta. With the availability of digital print services online and locally, we decided to stop buying film. We started out looking for a \"cheap\" digital camera. But after weeks of research and 100's of reviews and hands on, we decided on 2 models. The sony dsc85 and canon G2. The canon reviews seemed better and we also liked the compactflash vs. sony stick. It's cheaper and we can use a microdrive. The canon is an excellent camera. The only negative thing we can find is the small LCD. But it more than makes up for it with it's swivel capabilities. Which can protect the LCD when folded away. LCD's can be damaged easily. Most film quality is around 4-5 mp range. And this camera beats out my 35mm SLR and scanner solution by far. I set the camera in the \"Program\" mode and I can select the type of lighting for indoors. This is great, as most pictures will have a yellow orange tint on most film and digital cameras. I can select Tungsten or flourescentetc. Anyhow, if your looking for a great camera with all the bells and whistles, best battery, photo quality then buy the G2! I can go on and on about the pros of this camera. Hope this review helps out. Also I thought I wouldn't use the digital zoom, but after shooting some test photo's, it's actually very good. The picture isn't as sharp, but it is hardly noticeable.","I've owned this camera for just over a month. I have been in photography for 30 years but this is my first digital.  I find myself wishing that its lens went a little wider but other than that, I can't think of another drawback.  It is definitely not for the person shopping for the point and shoot camera. If you're going to pay this type of money for all the options, use them!  It's small, well constructed and balances nicely for shooting.  I'm well satisfied with the image results and think that it should serve my purposes for years to come.","I am by no means a professional photographer, so I was a little concerned purchasing such a high end digital camera.  I have been pleasently surprised!!  The camera is very easy to use, and the pictures are great.  I have taken inside and outside pictures and all look great.  Plus the swivelling LCD screen makes it very easy to get great picture taking angles.  I am recommending anyone who is looking for a digital camera to seriously consider the G2.","To make it simple. This camera is great!!. I have my new camera for two weeks now. It can be at the same time, simple for my kids and wife to shot a excelent picture and offers the flexiblity usually found in sofisticated 35 mm cameras. The Swivel view finder is very convinient. I looked at reviews for about a month for Nikon, Olympus and Canon before I bought this camera, and I have to say that the G2 offers the best cost - value ratio.","I've loved photography for years but only 3 months ago actually bought a digital camera - Canon A20.  Thats a good camera but limited manual adjustments - hence my move to the G2.  I've only had the G2 a week but since then I've created some excellent low light and sun rise shots - all free of noise and grain.<br />This camera, combined with my Epson Stylus Photo 890, have allowed me to produce excellent photos, the quality of which could easily be mistaken for photos taken with my Nikon SLR on top quality film and printed professionally.  I'm a bit of a perfectionist so tend to use the RAW image mode, ISO 50 settings and use premium photo glossy paper/semi glossy paper at 1440 or 2800 dpi - 8 * 10 prints look wonderful.  Its only when you get a magnifying glass out and look very hard that you notice that a conventional camera does beat a digital one.<br />The supplied software is very easy to use and makes organising your photos easy and convenient - better than any other image organiser I have tried.","All over the best for it's size and weight.<br />Superb, another crowning achievement by Canon.","The Cannon G2 is a great camera.  It?s my first digital and I too researched all the web sites and decided that this served up the best price/performance.  I really wanted the Compact Flash Media Format and I sprung for the 1GB IBM Microdrive.  I took the camera on my vacation to China and took over 1,000 high resolution pictures on the Microdrive, including some short video clips, without a problem.  The camera comes with a filing system as you shoot to keep them organized.  What amazed me was the low light capabilities.  I could take indoor pictures in restaurants, theaters, museums, etc without flash.  I even took some wonderful shots inside a darkened cave that had multi-color illumination.  The software that comes with the camera was reasonably easy to figure out and it?s easy to import scanned TIFF pictures into the Albums.  The printouts on photo paper are incredible.  The only disappointment is the low resolution of the video clips ? but I don?t think others are any better.  Bottom line ? I?m delighted.","A great digital camera-- with a major, major problem. The autofocus (...). Its that simple. I've got a Nikon 990 and a Canon Powershot S100, and I've never had the number of poorly focussed images that I've taken with the G2.<br />The G2 has major advantages-- integration with Canon's flash system being notable, and extremely high resolution, especially in Raw mode; but you will go nuts with the focus.","I own a Canon D30 and was delighted and disappointed with the EOS-1D specs, having a need for a 6 Mp camera and without one being available from Canon, I elected to get the G2 as a beater and wait until Canon comes out with a 6 Mp EOS. In the mean time, this camera shoots very good pictures (esp in the RAW mode) I use my D30 batteries and charger with it plus have several IBM 1 Gb micro drives to use between cameras as well.<br />With the Canon Wide and Tele lens set you will be able to extend the optical capabilities (the tele does have some barrel effects) Since getting the G2, I take it everywhere and I use my D30 much less - the D30 shines for long range nature shots, extreme wide angle (Sigma 14mm EX), and complex flash master/slave or celesteral time exposures via a Meade LX-90 and EOS adapter.<br />Considering price, quality, and featues you can't beat this camera and the firmware is actually better than the D30 with regard to bugs (I haven't found any, but the D30 has several -  nothing that turning the camera on/off won't fix).<br /><br />If you use the hot shoe and Canon speedlights (I use the 550 and 420) this camera works perfectly however, use a hand held device like an \"L\" bar or pistol grip to hold onto the camera as the weight of the speedlight makes the camera top heavy and it won't be long before you will drop it.","After looking around for a digital camera, I think I have found the right camera. The Canon Powershot G2 is it. I have researched different cameras (Fuji, Canon, Olympus, and Nikon) and chose this one. I am not a camera buff or budding pro. I like good pictures. My wife is a technophobe and she loves how easy it is to use. It provides enough flexibility to alter shutter speeds and f stops to satisfy anyone.<br />Every camera owner will say theirs is the best, but ultimately, it is a personal comfort decision- and price. This camera fit my budget (...), takes excellent pictures, and easy to use. The pictures produced often depend on the taker and not the camera ( to a certain extent). The camera has all the bells and whistles to satisfy any techno lover, like me.<br />Criticisms of the camera are limited- heavier than most and zoom limited.<br />If you enjoy gadgets ( as I do or you wouldn't be reading this), searching for the right fit is just as much fun as buying it.","After working with this camera at the store at which I am employed, I have come to the conclusion that all around, this is the best high-end consumer grade digital camera.  There are several ways in which this camera comes out on top over the cameras made by its competitors.<br />More than likely, the camera people will compare this to is the Nikon Coolpix 995--at least these are the two cameras most people narrow it down to.  Each camera offers things that the other doesn't, but I find the Canon is superior in several ways.<br />1.  The Canon is *far* more user friendly.  The controls are laid out in a way that makes them easy to find.  SLR users that are converting from film to digital will find the switch to be a little easier with the Canon.  One thing I don't like about the Nikon is the way manual control works; hold down this button, move this switch, push down that button while moving that switch, etc etc.  Way too complicated for the average consumer.  On the Canon it's a breeze.  Switch the control to \"M\" and the 4-way pad on the back up the camera controls aperture and shutter speed.  That's it.<br />2.  The Canon uses an anti-reflective coating on the screen.  Nikon and Olympus *still* don't do that with their consumer grade cameras.  The anti-reflective coating helps heaps when you're out in the sun, where the screens on most other cameras get faded out and are impossible to see.<br />3.  The rechargable battery that comes with the Canon lasts far longer than other camera batteries (i.e. AA's or the rechargables Nikon uses).  You could easily get over 200 shots from a single battery, with the LCD screen on.<br />4.  The software package the Canon comes with blows away what Nikon and Olympus give you.  Adobe Photoshop--the standard in the graphics industry.<br />5.  The Canon comes with a 32 megabyte card, which is 2x what most manufacturers ship the camera with.<br />6.  Two words -- hot shoe.  Right on the camera.  Who wants to carry around a bulky flash bracket when you can buy a camera that a standard flash attaches right to?<br />If you've read reviews from computer magazines or from digital camera websites, you'll see that the Canon gets consistently high reviews.  In a recent review, the G2 was rated #1 over the Coolpix 995, which the reviewers claimed produced pictures which weren't quite as sharp as the ones from the G2.  I've been waiting to buy a digital camera.  When I have the means, I am very confident this is the one I'll go with.","I have had this camera for the last two month and it is all<br />that I have expected and more.<br />Excellent buy.","This is my first Canon camera and now I know what Canon fans have been raving about all these years. This is a well-built, well-designed, and well-executed digital camera. It certainly is intended for a advanced user or \"prosumer,\" but I believe it can also serve as a good camera for a beginner who knows he or she will advance in skill.<br />Most beginners buy a point and shoot camera and then upgrade to something more expensive if they \"get into\" photography. The G2 can work as a point and shooter. It has a fully automatic setting. And the pictures it takes are extraordinary. At 4 megapixels, they are as good as any amatuer user will ever need given the capability of home printers.<br />As you grow in confidence, and want to experiment with adjustments to shutter speeds, ISO, manual focus, etc., etc., it is all here and organized in a logical and accessible manner. The camera will even take short movies, though I doubt that feature is any more needed than the snapshot feature on digital camcorders.<br />You need to hold this camera to really appreciate how well built it is. So many digital cameras look and feel \"cheap\" even if they cost multiple hundreds of dollars. The G2 is solid and attractive.<br />I particularly enjoy the innovative LCD screen which flips out and rotates like those on camcorders. It also flips completely over for self-portraits (very convenient with the wireless remote) and can be turned toward the camera and snapped into place to protect the LCD from scratches while transporting.<br />I researched several cameras before I purchased the Canon G2. I don't regret my choice in the slightest. The G2 is more expensive than some, but it is so versatile that I expect I will actually save money because I can't think of a thing I might need as my skills advance that this camera won't provide.","I have taken more than 500 pictures with tihs camera. Indoor pictures come out great but 90% of the outdoor pictures with people in it come out fuzzy in auto mode. Has anyone else seen this problem?","A nice unit. Price and features are only average for this class. Feels a bit flimsey. Minor artifacts when sharpening is turned on. It would have been nice to see a better lens. More zoom, better macro. Maybe a 5mp like Sony, Minolta and others are doing. Even better would be a SLR type layout. If you buy this camera you are not likely to regret it. But at 4mp, you better not do too much cropping if you want full 8x10 printouts. Since at 8x10 a 4mp like this only outputs 210 lines per inch. Photo quality requires 200 lines per inch. a 5mp would give more flexibity. The nice things are that it uses industry standard memory sticks so the cost of ownership will be lower as a result. Also comes with a slightly larger then most 32meg memory card. Not big enough, so plan on buying a 128meg one. But large enough to enjoy the camera for a few weeks first.","I have been using a Powershot S10 for the past 1 1/2 years.  I was totally amazed at the features of the G2.  I was preparing to upgrade to the G1, but I'm really glad I waited.<br />The weight of the camera is pretty good.  I notice that it is more sensitive to camera shake and advises you so you can take better pictures.  I have noticed that it is more finicky in this area and requires you to make sure that you hold the camera steady.  I have tried using the camera in M (Manual Exposure) mode and there are so many more things to control for a much better shot!  I have tried using a Lexarmedia 48MB 8x CF card and a Sandisk 128MB.  No speed improvements for the 8X card.<br />Coming from the S10 (Ni-MH battery) this 511 battery lasts so much longer!  Excellent battery life!<br />All in all I find this camera to have great design and great features!  I intend on getting a LOEWPRO camera bag.  I noticed that some parts of the camera can scratch easily.","I have been using a Powershot S10 for the past 1 1/2 years.  I was totally amazed at the features of the G2.

After reseaching the digital camera field for about 3 months, I decided on the Canon Powershoot G2.  I am extremely pleased with its performance.  I never thought a digital camera could rival a 35mm SLR camera, but the Canon excedes most if not all of the attributes of a photochromatic paper camera.  Though the camera is midsized, it is packed with so many features that it is perfect for those photographers who what the versatility of a full sized SLR but do not want to lug around a briefcase full of camera equipment.  Some of its standout features include a LCD screen that swings out like a camcorder and folds away with the screen towards the camera body, thus protecting it from the eventual scratch; and Compactflash II card compatibility enabling high image storage, which you will need with the camera set at its highest 4 megapixel resolution.  A 32MG Smartmedia card will not suffice with a 4.0 megapixel camera.<br />You will not be disappointed with this camera.  I highly recommend it.","After months of exhaustive searching, I finally decided to purchase the Canon Powershot G2 (it's a wonderfully re-designed upgrade to the Powershot G1).  The clarity of the images that this camera takes is spectacular.  Combine that with the list of outstanding features that aren't included on any other digital camera: ISO 50, RAW image capture, a flip out LCD screen (which is much more handy than you would think), an infrared remote for long exposures and self-portraits, and easy menu functions -- this camera is without equal in it's price range.<br />It's definitely not for the beginner, but, if you're familiar with photography, you'll be able to take sharp, beautiful pictures with this camera.  Skin tones are perfect and the built in flash with exposure compensation does a good job for portraits.  And, if you're considering a Sony, this camera uses the more inexpensive Compact Flash memory storage system.  Compact Flash memory cards are cheaper than the Sony Memory Stick and are compatible with more peripherals than Memory Stick.<br />All in all, if it's in your price range, you will be very pleased with the Canon Powershot G2.","I have been using G2 for 2 month...I tried to find some problem on G2 but I couldn't...<br />This is really excellent....No regret!!","I read reviews of digital cameras everywhere on the Internet and in magazines and came to one conclusion, the Canon PowerShot G2 was a great camera.<br />After getting the camera, I couldn't agree more.  The controls are intuitive to use and understand and the layout is impressive.  I wanted a camera my wife could pick up and use without thinking and a camera I could have as much creative control as my 35 MM SLR(s).  This has hit the mark.<br />The dial on top the camera allows you to select the manual modes (shutter priority, apaeture priority, full manual...) and several pre programmed modes (landscape, portrait, night mode...) and of course full auto.<br />The flash is as good as any film or digital point and shoot camera but I also got the Canon 420EX Speeflite flash.  (Did I mention this baby has a hot shoe?)  This is a versital professional flash that talks directly with the camera and allows a lot of creative control.<br />Of course no matter how nice the camera is to use is for nothing if the photos are poor or average.  The camera doesn't dissapoint!  The photos are outstanding.  Generally speaking, bad shots are not the fault of the camera!<br />I did pick up 2 Sandisk 128 MB compact flashes to add to the unit and I got the wide angle lense but haven't used it yet so no comment.<br />Oh, writing and reading to the compact flash media seems quick.  I also have note used the movie mode yet either.","The Canon PowerShot G2 is, hands down, the finest compact, high-end, amateur/professional digital camera on the market today.  Together with the lens adapter, the teleconverter (1.5x) and wide-angle lens available, it simply can't be beat.  Before I purchased this camera I spent several hours personally comparing it to every other 3+ megapixel camera currently on the market, and there is simply no comparison with any other.  I would not pretend to compare this camera to the Canon EOS D30 and the even newer D30x with it's use of interchangeable, incomparable EF lenses, but photography, not simply digital photography just leaped another millennium with Canon's improvements over the 1-year old PowerShot G1.<br />The Product Review and other personal review at this site have provided you more of the technical aspects of this jewel, so I will spare any repetition--except to say that the ability to use my 550EX flash normally used with my Canon EOS-3 and 1v is not only teriffic but a great money saver.<br />Don't be fooled by the stylish looks of other digitals--not that they are slackards by any means (such as the Dimage 7), but it's performance, although outstanding, seems elementary alongside the G2.<br />ENOUGH SAID!","One week and I'm infatuated with the capabilities, ease of use and the remarkable images possible with this 4 megapixel wonder.  This is my first digital camera purchase and based one what I saw in the G1, which was very close for me, I purchased sight unseen the G2.  The layout is extremely intuitive, so much so that my wife, who has never handled a digital camera, was able to access the playback mode and erase ... pictures I'd taken her.  Features I like:  The rotating LCD screen which allows the camera to be used from any position.  Navigating through the many features available is a snap with the rotating mode dial.  Snap mode is like infinity focus, good for those street shots.  The shutter is responsive, and there is no lag between what you see and what you shoot.  I tried this by pointing camera out window and waiting for a car to enter window frame.  When car doing 35-40 mph was fully in narrow window frame, I snapped, and captured exactly what I saw.  You can select either 0, 2 or 10 sec. review mode, depending on how fast you want to shoot.  Pictures are very sharp, color is accurate and it is wildly easy to use. Manual focus capabilities.  Five resolution modes including a RAW format of 2272 x 1704, which equals a 7.5\" x 5.5\" image at 300dpi, the minimum for hi-res, magazine and book reproduction.  (8\" x 10\" image at max res. is 228 dpi without resampling). Software for PC and Mac is effortless and includes Photoshop LE.  Very efficient and no bugs.  A few nitpicks are:  It is a handful.  The charge and USB port door isn't the sturdiest.  The startup music has to go.  Software takes up lots of MBs.  Learning camera, but so far so very, very good.<br />UPDATE: November 16, 2003.<br />I still have this camera.  The 2nd week I owned camera -see above for date - I received a magazine assignment.  Hauling out the film gear, I suddenly realized - I could use the G2!  I purchased an adaptor - SafeSync - to protect circuits and reduce the voltage of high powered Norman strobes to 6 volts.  Adaptor fits in G2 hotshoe.  It may have seemed a little odd to the CEO when he strolled up to my elaborate lighting setup and I whipped out this little camera, but the shoot was successful and paid for the camera. Since then have done many many assignments with this camera and just last week used it for a shoot for the Wall St. Journal.  Why haven't I upgraded?  Because I haven't had a need to.  This is truly an amazing camera.","I like the design of the operation and shape very much, it's small enough but very easy to handle and operate. The performance of night photo is very good, and the long bettary is beyond my expectation. The focus is very accuate and quick. The LCD is quite unique and smart that I like it very very much."]},{"name":"Kodak DX3700","amazon_reviews":["Love this camera...appears to be brand new!

I HIGHLY RECOMEND!","This is a great little camera that gives quality photos.  The only dislike I have is that there is a slight delay once you take the picture before it actually takes the shot.  So, sometimes I have to shoot and reshoot to get the shot I want.","This camera is great for everyday use.  The 3.1 megapixels effective make it a worthwhile buy.  Definitely a graet camera.","Extraordinarily basic camera.  No optical zoom.  No manual settings.  No movie mode.  In other words, the camera is literally a point-and-shoot camera...much like a typical entry-level 35mm film camera is.<br />The DX3700 prints surprisingly good-looking images up to 5x7's, but 8x10's look a tad grainy...a shortcoming of Kodak's 3 megapixel CCD and lens quality (or lack thereof), I think.  I've seen Olympus and Nikon 3 megapixel cameras produce noticeably sharper images.<br />But if you don't need a zoom lens and only want to make 4\" prints, this camera is a very affordable and simple solution.  It's also great to give to kids who want or need a simple digital camera.","Kodak dx3700 camera sometimes results wonderful pictures but it is hard to understand whether the picture is as you want or not by viewing at LCD. Sometimes LCD display pictures clear, but as you transfer to PC, you become confused, they can be seen as blurred.<br />Its battery state viewer works wrong, don't trust it, your battery can run out suddenly.<br />Kodak Chargeable Batteries are not durable, with Duracell CRV3 battery you can take app. 250 pics, but with chargeable ones, only 50. In my country(Turkey), CRV3 type battery is not sold(an uncommon type of battery).<br />It is very fast to transfer pics to PC. aS soon as I connect my camera to PC, it begins transferring. Also picture software is useful, but I don't recommend you to use it because it reduces the image quality.<br />Another lacking property of DX3700 is that it does not provide high quality low resolution pictures. You have to change the sizes of pics by software. You are obliged to have only two choices, two resolutions.<br />Finally, I prefer dx3900 or dx4900 which have optical zoom and a lot of extra features.","I was looking for a digital camera, that had good resolution and was an affordable price.  Well after looking at many digital cameras, i decided to buy the Kodak Easyshare DX3700.  The resolution is great, and it is easy to use.  I like the TV hook up that it comes with, so you can view your pictures.  The software is great.  The only problem that I have had so far with the camera, is that the LCD screen shows doesnt show the picture at the complete clarity, however the picture is perfect when you look at it on the computer or TV.  Overall, the Kodak DX3700 is a great digital camera.","This is a nice camera for the price. 3.1MP and takes good pictures with some practice. Be sure you have a lot of light when taking indoor pics though. Also, there is no need at all for the docking station. The camera plugs right into any USB port and shows up as a drive on the computer. You can then just pull your images off without having to use Kodak's software. As far as recharging the batteries, I picked up some Ni-MH batteries and a portable charger ..., and I'm good to go. I'd also recommend getting an additional memory card.","I bought the Kodak DX 3700 a few days ago for vacation.  A few KMarts in our area are closing their doors, and all of their digital cameras, docks, and supplies were 40% off!  I snapped up the camera and dock as quickly as I could.  This being my first digital camera, I have to say I'm satisfied overall.  The only thing I'll be using the camera for is basic point and shoot photography and maybe a little bit of photo manipulation and maybe a little emailing. The 3700 meets all of my needs, so I'm happy.<br />I was dissapointed though with a few things... first the memory card.  KMart was out of cards so I went to circuit city instead to buy one.  I told the salesperson what model camera I had and he sold me the Compact Flash card instead of the MMC card.  I arrived home excited to play with my new toy, and I had to drive 25 minutes back to the store to get a new memory card that was $25.00 more expensive!  Annoying to say the least.  Also, the dock I purchased was missing the rechargable batteries.  That kind of [angered] me...  But I figured since I got the dock for 40% off that I could spend the $$ I saved on batteries anyway.  I called Kodak to inform them of the missing product and there was nothing they could do to help me.  Some customer service they have!  Also, the dock was the last one KMart had in stock and it was being sold as is simply because they were going out of buisness.  So, I was kind of up a creek with this battery situation.  In defense of the dock, however, I have to say that the one touch downloading is GREAT!  I love the convenience.  The software is decent... after working with programs like Photoshop, the Kodak software pales in comparison as far as options go.  But for basic manipulation, it's not bad.<br />Overall, I'm liking my new digital camera.  At 40% off, it wasn't a bad deal at all considering I purchased the dock and camera for the total of the regularly priced camera itself.  If I were to buy again, I might consider the 3900 to have the convenience of more options.","What I liked in this camera most, is the user-friendly functions, it's very easy to change settings and to Review your Albums while on the road, and the picture Quality is Super.<br />As for the memory I got me the 64 Mb MMC card which is more than enough if you are thinking of Sending emails \" thats 200+ pic\" and 92 pictures for the highest resolution \" Equals 2* 36 films on the old cameras\"<br />as for the Cons: don't Repeat my mistake by not buying the Optional Easyshare Dock, because this Extra item will Help you Recharge the batteries that comes with the camera Box and they will live alot longer than the Standard AA Batteries \" which Bring us to the Last part of the Cons\": this baby Eats Batteries Like Popcorn, so make sure you got the Dock or atleast A Recharger For this Digital Camera...","I think this camera if fun and easy for those of us who have kids and is not available to use the computer often enough to do the downloading and figuring out the software.  My kids love me to use it, the 4 year old likes to see the pictures i take immediatly after. He is camera shy but allows me to use this so he can see,then he can just slip it on the camera dock and it is ready for the computer.","Docking station:  You don't need a docking station for this camera.  We don't have one, and we still enjoy this camera.  We use a regular wall-plug battery recharger that works just as well for the batteries.  Save yourself the extra money, and just keep the USB cable on your desk--plugs right into the camera, and you can upload your pictures quickly.<br />Picture quality: First rate.  We print the photos out on photo-quality paper, and they look about as good as with a \"regular\" camera.<br />Ease of operation: The camera is easy to use.  There are a few downsides, though:<br />(1) On/Off and flash buttons are tiny for grownup fingers;<br />(2) Regardless of light, there is a 1 or 2 second delay from shutter release to actual picture being taken--if you are taking action pictures, this will be a hinderance;<br />(3) There is a short delay for every button you press (you never know if you need to press it again, or if the camera is just processing the request--you may need to press the On/Off button several times, for example, before it does what you want).<br />Convenience: Uploading is easy.  Taking pictures is easy.  The included Kodak software also makes saving & sending the photos easy.<br />Battery life: This is the weakest aspect of the camera.  Instructions say you should get 300 pictures from the batteries.  We don't, we get maybe half that. The quirky thing is, when you upload your pictures from the camera to your PC, a little message comes on the screen that says \"Battery level is good,\" but the camera batteries die next time you take pictures.<br />Overall: We got this camera to photograph our newborn and save/send relatives the photos as easily as possible.  It has met that need, and exceeded our expectations of photo quality.  Kodak just needs to make the buttons bigger and more responsive.  Have extra batteries on hand or get a recharger, then you won't be disappointed.","I took the camera to the North Shore of Minnesota and got some spectacular sunrise shots over Lake Superior.  I was able to plug the video out from the camera to the VCR and watch a slide show of all my pics on TV.  When I got home, I loaded the software on my PC and it uploaded 35 pictures in a matter of minutes.  I didn't purchase the docking station.  I just used the USB port from the camera to my PC.  I was able to email my pics directly from the Kodak software - neat!<br />One thing I wish it had was a self timer.  The next Kodak model, the 3900, has a self timer, but was $120 more.  I will also purchase another set of batteries and a charger which runs about $35 bucks.  Another concern is the delay from the time you snap the shot until the flash goes off and takes the picture - there's about a 2 second delay.  I was trying to get one of the otter's at the Duluth aquarium, but he was way too quick for me to capture.  Landscape and portraits are good - action shots would require a different kind of camera.<br />I'm using an online print service so I haven't printed off any pictures yet (I'm looking for a good printer if anyone has a suggestion).<br />For the digital novice, I would recommend this camera. If you don't like the shot, delete it.  The camera gives you 3 times to change your mind if you hit delete by accident.","I purchased the DX3700 somewhat out of desperation (many models sold out) but was intrigued by the high resolution. I also purchased a dock. The SD card was sold right alongside the camera and wasn't a price or availability issue.<br />I took the camera on a trip and had 56 high res photos on the 64MB card with room to spare. I thought the camera was a bit bulky and wasn't thrilled with the battery life, but decided to wait until I saw the picture quality.<br />When I downloaded the pictures to my laptop, I was pleasantly shocked by the beautiful color and detail of the photos. And the macro close-up shots were excellent!<br />Pros:<br />Low price for 3.1 megapixel camera, ease of use, quick battery recharging (less than 1 hour), great picture quality, excellent macro shots, decent (if slow) software<br />Cons:<br />Dock more or less required, so-so battery life, somewhat bulky.","I am extremely pleased with my purchase of the DX3700...even those it uses the MMC cards...I don't care really.  I'm sure a higher MB cards will be coming out soon.  Reading the other reviews, I realized how much people are upset about that aspect.  But you must remember, every time something new comes out, it's this way.  They will constantly improve the product, and the price WILL go down.  Right now the highest MB card is the 64MB...which only allows about 75 pictures for a 3.1 MP camera...but hey.  Who needs to take more than that? *unless you are on vacation and don't have access to a computer* (which I don't worry about).<br />I didn't care about the optical zoom (which this model doesn't have) the model that did have it was [amt] more.  Now with technology constantly changing...it's better to be on the edge. And in a few years, when I'm ready to upgrade...I won't feel like I'm losing so much money in an expensive piece of equipment. THis camera only cost me [amt]","I bought a dx3700 camera for my girlfriend for Chrismas.  She took about 30 pictures with and the battery died. I looked in the manual to see how to charge the batteries and it said to put it on the camera dock. The camera dock is sold seperately for [amt].  I was not happy.  Also the batteries that came with were supposed to last an average of 350 pictures.  It takes great pictures and I love the camera but to have to start looking around for a charger and new batteries a day after I use itis down right chincey.

Docking Station is a must, (that sales people do not tell you about), to keep batteries charged and transfer images to your computer.","I purchased a Kodak dx3700 camera for Xmas for my extremely non-technical wife (no docking station). After reading countless reviews and visiting manufacturer websites, I decided on a Kodak Easyshare Camera. I originally wanted the dx3600 because it had an optical zoom lens. Unfortunately, due to lack of supply and time frame, I had to get to the dx3700 in order to have a gift under the tree. This was my 1st digital purchase.  Ease of use and picture quality were my main concerns because we will primarily print the photos.<br />To my surprise, the ease of taking photos and downloading photos was EXCEPTIONAL!!! I was even surprised that the photos had a date/time stamp and downloaded pictures were automatically categorized into new folders by date (GREAT FEATURE!). In regards to ease of use, THERE IS NOTHING BETTER! Literally, after 10 minutes, we were taking photos and making prints. We were all impressed.  However, we had nothing to compare the picture quality to. My wife was also hesitant to let me know that she would have liked a zoom lens.<br />I began to research \"comparable\" cameras with zoom lenses. After thinking about upgrading to a dx3900, I decided to try another brand. I already knew Kodak's picture quality because the dx3900 is basically a dx3700 with 2x zoom.<br />After reading many more reviews and evaluating pros & cons, I decided to try the Canon A20.  It was \"only\" 2.1 Megapixels, but it had a 3x zoom and looked like a Point & Shoot. Unfortunately, it did not have a date/time stamp. I purchased one from a retail store knowing that I would return it and buy it much cheaper online. I unpacked it.  I immediately noticed that it required 4 AA batteries.  The Kodak required only 1 Lithium or 2 AA Ni-MH. The Canon was MUCH more difficult to set up.  Kodak had spoiled me.  Canon's camera interface and software installation were MUCH more complex. I became nervous because I thought it would be to complicated for my wife to enjoy. I completed all setups. I had her hold the Canon and Kodak, then take some identical pictures with both cameras using the zoom and different settings indoors (where most of her pictures would be taken anyway). I printed them, then gave her a \"Pepsi Challenge\".<br />All of the pictures that she preferred were from the 2.1MP Canon, not the 3.1MP Kodak.  The Kodak's were not bad. The Canon's were just better. Contrary to what I would have thought (being a digital novice), she was right. Although Canon's \"ease of use\" was definitely inferior to Kodak's, it had superior picture quality and a 3x optical zoom (remember: the dx3900 only had a 2x zoom). Although we LOVED Kodak's simplicity, we had to opt for picture quality. Although there will be a greater learning curve, picture quality lasts forever (If I can only get her to truly believe that).<br />I returned the Kodak, and ordered the Canon A20 online.  I was even able to get the Canon for less than a dx3900. Although I will really miss Kodak's simplicity, every time I look at a printed photo, I will know that I made the right decision. I only hope that battery drain will not be too much of a nuisance.","Bravo for the clean images of the 3.3 megapixel setup, but take one star away for the lack of a true (optical) zoom and another for making the camera compatible with MultiMediaCard memory format (harder to find, costlier, smaller max memory size than CF) and there you have it, a 3 star pkg.","I have been putting off buying a digital camera for months. I was debating on the Sony Mavica, but the pixel quality just wasn't there. 3.1 pixels for such a low price! True, it doesn't have all the bangs and whistles that other digital cameras have, but it has the most imortant feature. Oustanding pictures. It doesn't have an optical zoom, but I seldom use that anyway. The camera dock (sold separatly) is a must. A simple push of the button on the docking station, and the pictures are in your computer ready for emailing or printing. What more could you want for so little money?","Despite complaints that this camera is a trap because it uses a storage medium that is unavailable(MMC cards), I specifically bought this camera because it uses MMC cards.  While MMC cards are not the primary medium of storage in this country, they are the primary source of storage for these devices in Europe. In fact, most high end European devices using digital storage mediums use MMC cards. Yes, they are currently more expensive byte per byte than some other storage mediums but they are also significantly smaller.<br />  They are also the fastest growing storage medium in this market.<br />  I currently have a mp3 player, a digital camera and a motion activated security device that all use the same MMC storage technology. Figure about a buck per megabyte.<br />  Kodak made a savvy move using the MMC storage medium. They are hoping to challenge current European/Japanese offerings by using a storage medium currently popular in Europe  combined with a camera that takes superb pictures.<br />  The \"kicker\" is the Kodak docking station. No matter how inept the computerphobe, once installed to a USB port, photo manipulation becomes as simple as dropping off 35mm film to a one hour developer. The docking station charges the battery while a single push of the button downloads the photos to the computer for manipulation, printing, emailing or whatever.<br />  Kodak offers some truly impressive printing technology whether or not you use their cameras.<br />  Controls are easy to use but like most digital technology, the number of control decisions offered are overwhelming unless one has a week or two to spend learning all of the potential permutations.<br />  Unlike film formats, bad pictures from digital cameras can be erased by the push of a button with no more expense than the cost of the electricity to record. Why digital cameras (Including this Kodak) offer so many different photo modes when it is just as easy to take a ton of pictures that can be later manipulated on a computer still confuses me<br />  Bottom line, the camera fits nicely into most hands- neither too big or too small, the controls are easy to understand and use, the camera takes great pictures and computer manipultation using the docking station is a breeze.<br />  Downsides are the Kodak name which is typically connected with low end(read quality) camera products (unless one is in the medical industry where their products have no peers), the use of MMC cards which are more expensive than than comparable storage mediums, and the ever present debate that compares digital to 35mm film cameras.<br />  If you get past these issues, you still might find that this is not a great but a pretty good camera for the money. The docking station pushes it over the edge for the computer challenged.","The main reason I bought this camera is because it has a SD/MMC Card. I looked at the more expensive DX-3900 and counted it out. It did have 2x optical zoon but used the wrong memory for me. I own a Palm M505 and want to have compatibility with that and my MP3 player. Even though the other chips may be superior in maximum memory capacity and probably speed, I think companies should standardise or we end up wasting our money as they change their minds. I purchased a 64MB MMC chip at Amazon quite cheap and it will work in my palm, the MP3 player and the Kodak camera... Go Figure. At least Kodak gave us the option in the DX3700. Others should but the DX3900.","I did a lot of comparison shopping before eventually deciding on the DX3700.  The price of this camera is awesome considering it is in the 3.1 MP range.  I was a little worried about the new multi media cards being used compared to the most widely used compact flash cards.  My fears were quickly subdued when I did a little reseach and noticed that alot of your highend cameras coming out now are switching to the new MMC cards.  As for pricing on the new cards they are right in line with the compact flash cards.  These prices came directly from Kodak's web site.  A 16MB Compact Flash cost 25.99 compared to the new MMC at 26.99, also comparable were the 32MB cards with about a two dollar difference in price.  I'm sure as more camera's begin using the new cards higher memory capacity will come out also.  This camera was extremely easy to use, I was taking pictures about five minutes after I unpacked it.  And the picture quality is unbelievable."]},{"name":"Kodak DX3900","amazon_reviews":["thought it would be a little better shape  it works","I take a lot of photos for my personal use and enjoyment, including the better ones with my friends.

It has not disappointed.  The pictures are easy to download into my computer for use with my deskjet printer and even easier to use the memorary card for great 4X6 photos on my photosmart printer.  A wonderful first experience with digital photography.","I've had this camera for approximatly 6 months and have not had one problem with it.  Very good camera for the price.","I have some ability with computers and about the same with cameras.  This was exactly what I hoped for:  I can take quick photos inside and out, dock the thing, transfer to the software with one touch, modify the photos, and email to grandpa/granma.  It will make me get DSL service to speed the emails on their way.<br />Photos are sharp and the detail is just fine or better.<br />I got a 128 storage card from my son for XMAS, and it is terrific.  Overall battery life seems fine and the camera traveled to and from Florida easily.  Software installation went fine, AFTER I got smart and turned off the Norton junk beforehand. I have 2000 Pro.  Only quibble:  got to use their dock. On the other hand: seamless activity for the everyday user.","One of the best investments I made. Its very simple to use and picture transfer is also fast. One word of advise if you have winxp then don't install the kodak software as its a pain to get rid of and keeps popping up everytime u boot up. apart from that the original 8MB card is a bummer so I purchased a 128MB card from amazon. The picture quality is extremely good and the flash is also reasonably powerful. the on camera menu is really good and easy to use. Its ability to hook upto to a TV for a slide show has really been helpful.Overall a great deal for day to day use and recreation.","My brother bought me this camera and gave it to me to take to Europe, take some photos and send them back to him. I hadn't bought a digital to date, because I wasn't satisfied with the quality. This changed when I saw what this camera could do, and the color quality. The 8-MB of memory it comes with, is not nearly enough. I got 2x128-MB to take to on my trip. My computer is running on WinXP, and the software wasn't marked as compatible, yet it worked fine. It had some features that made it more convenient than the XP bundled software, but it was really slow. But that's the software, not the camera. The camera works well, with many features found in more expensive competitors. Now all I've got to do is figure out what to do with all the photos! I took a lot of duplicates, got rid of the bogus ones, and wound up with a lot mre quality shots than I would have come back with using film.","I got this camera about 2 weeks ago. It's my first digital camera. I started taking pictures right away. It's so easy to use a baby can do it. There are many features included that only more expensive cameras have. To start it has 3.1megapixels maximum resolution. This is really all you need to take quality photos, and make great prints. Forget the 4 and 5 megapixel cameras, which add detail that you don't notice, but cost 3 or 4 times as much. You can change the setting down to 0.8MP for emailing photos(smaller size). There is a manual shutter speed setting, so you can take photos of fast moving objects, or at night(longer shutter). You don't really need the docking station, unless you don't have a battery charger ... . You also can take black and white photos, change the white balance for different light conditions, exposure compensation adjust sharpness,set a date and time stamp in different formats and exposure metering. There is also a self timer of 10 seconds, a power save feature, camera sounds, and a video out feature to see photos from the camera on your TV. You can set your language to English, French, german, spanish, italian or portugues. If you want a Big bang for your buck, this is the camera for you. I would get a bigger compact flash memory...maybe 128MB, as the included 8mb takes about 6 photos at 3.1mb, or 28 in low quality setting.","I have had my DX3900 for about a year now and it is still reliable.  I recently upgraded my computer system and printer, but don't feel it necessary to get a new camera since this camera is so great.  The photo quality is fabulous!  It is so nice to download photos with the touch of the easyshare dock button!  How easy!  I primarily use this camera to take photos for ebay ads and I swear that my super clear, quality photos help my sales!  I highly recommend this camera.  It is a bit pricey, but believe me...it is worth it!  You will not be disappointed.","This camera is really easy to use. It takes clear pictures with great detail when seen on the screen. It is not heavy and it has a perfect size to travel with. The software is great and easy to use too. The only problem is that when you print the pictures all the quality is gone. So this is a great camera  but not if you primary use of it is to print the photos.","We just used this camera on a 2 week trip to Montana during which I was able to get a good feel for this camera.  Likes:  Light, fits in pocket, good quality pictures, I used 2.1 meg most of the time, easy to download to computer, stored lots of photos with my added large memory card.  Dislikes:  Can't see LCD screen in the sun, the digitial zoom is TERRIBLE--is there a secret to getting a clear photo?  I purchased lenses to go with the camera and they worked terrible as well.  Otherwise, for good quality simple photos, this is a great camera.","I have been using this camera for about 6 months and think it's great! I use it for the purpose of transferring the pics to CD and then putting them into Kmart for development and the print quality on Kodak paper is fantastic. The photos I'm getting are great. The biggest downside to this camera is the inability to take multiple pictures close together. it allows you to take 2 or 3 then pauses for several seconds, sometimes over 15 therefore missing the \"Kodak Moment\" LOL. It does have a Burst mode for doing just this but it's useless coz the Burst mode cannot be used with the Flash so of course the photos dont come out if inside. All round though this is a great little cam. I've heard of people complaining about it, but they are more high-end users, if you are just the little famliy guy wanting to take pics of everyday things and not a real technohead then this cam will do you just fine! Some of the photos I've taken are absolutely fantastic.","It a great camera for beginners! And trust me it take beautiful picture and I printed a 8x10 and the picture look real sharp. I also e-mail my family member and they too enjoy the pictures.So far the experience been great ! I was looking for Kodak DX3600 but it was replace with Kodak DX3900. Consumer Report rate it pretty good that why I had to check it out. You will need to buy more memory because they only give you 8MB but for me that doesn`t matter. So if you looking for camera this one it !!","After using a Nikon 35mm film camera for years, I needed something digital and easy for my wife and I to use for our Animals Needing Homes web page.<br />While loading the software, I experienced an error just after selecting English. We both know a few words of Spanish, so I decided to give that a try. DO NOT DO THIS unless you know the other language well. The installation went fine...with all the menu options and screen instructions in Spanish. We barely knew enough Spanish to keep from deleting something we were trying to save. Later, we uninstalled the whole thing and tried again in English and all went well.<br />The pictures are clear and sharp when we make sure to hold the camera steady while trying to photograph animals more interested in running and playing than in posing. The 3mp is more resolution than we need for web photos that are rarely much bigger than 3 x 4 inches. In the event we want to have some printed, the extra pixels will be nice.<br />We thought we'd try to use disposable batteries and not buy the charger. This has proved to be impractical; we just received the charger.<br />Overall, the camera is working well for us. Our main complaint is that the digital viewing screen is almost useless in the sun. Bottom line is that for our first digital camera, this was a good choice (for our use, 1mp or 2mp would have been ok). For other photography situations, however, I still grab the Nikon.","I bought the Kodak DX3900 camera 6 months ago and have been very happy with it since day one. I had two concerns about buying this camera:<br /><br />1) whether 3 megapixels would truly create high-quality photos, and<br />2) would the photos look like 'normal' (non-digital) photos when developing them for print.<br />I soon discovered that 3 megapixels is definitely enough--even for prints enlarged to 8x10--and that the photos look even better than other non-digital prints from a 35mm camera. It takes better photos than any 35mm camera I have ever owned. Also, the LCD screen is sharp enough to let you know whether the photos you take are high-quality enough to keep, or not. This camera not only gives you the many benefits of taking digital photos, but also gives you superior quality photos at an excellent price.<br />This camera is lightweight, durable, and very easy to use: it is the first camera whose 'extra' features, such as zooming, adjusting for sunlight, changing resolution, etc, are intuitive enough to use without constantly referring to the user manual (the user manual is also helpful, by the way). The docking station (an optional accessory) makes it very easy to download the photos to your computer.<br />I strongly recommend this camera.","This is my first digital camera and I have to say I'm impressed so far.  It's great for my wife, who isn't near the tech weenie I am.  At the press of a button, she can charge the battery, download pictures, and initialize the memory card.<br />My only complaint is with the battery (or so I think).  I can charge the battery all night, put it in the camera, and the camera will not turn on.  If I turn it off and on several times (when this happens), the camera will eventually turn on.","I spent many hours researching digital cameras to find the one that suited my needs and was within my price range.<br /><br />I am 20 years old and have 7 younger siblings - we used the camera to take our individual portraits. I took the graduation pictures of a friend of mine as well. The 3MP produced an excellent 8x10, as well as 5x7. I also use this camera on trips, at events and at home for my regular snapshots. I usually set the megapixals at 1.8 for general use. I am always pleased with the way the camera works, there are plenty of setting options, but not so many that it is confusing. The b&w and sepia settings are fun.<br />I would recommend using Amazon's Ofoto for photo processing. They do a good job quickly, and it is fun to use their albums to share pictures online. I also use Ofoto's free photo editor, which is extremely basic. If you want something fancy, Amazon has a selection of good photo editing software.<br />In addition to the the camera, I purchased the EasyShare dock, which is a must have for ease of use. It is well worth the price. It, like the camera, is gimmick-free.<br /><br />I purchased a 128mb compact flash for additional memory. If I did that again I would just buy 64mb, but that extra memory might come in handy on a long vacation.<br /><br />I purchased a \"travel kit\" from Kodak's website, which includes another rechargable battery, portable recharger with different plugs for if you are out of the country and have different outlets. It came in a camera bag that is a good size for the camera.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera for anybody who wants to have a good camera to use and enjoy for a long time.","This camera is so easy to operate even a beginner can use it!  I read all of the reviews and was concerned I made a bad choice.  Like my mom always said you need to make up your own mind!  I love this camera!  I bought it on a whim with not much research and am shocked by how good the pictures are.  I'm not expecting a professional quality picture, but it is pretty darn good.  I have since read the manual and can't believe how lucky I was in picking a camera with so many features.","This is my first digital camera and I love it.  It takes exceptional pictures.  It is so easy to use.  Even more impressive is the software that comes with it that allows you to do so many fun and great things with your photos.  You can edit the size, the color, even make it a black and white photo.  If you want to email the photo you simply click on the email button and off it goes.  It is an amazingly great camera.  I totally recommend it.  I also purchased the optional camera dock.  I recommend that too.  It keeps the battery charged on your camera, and you only have to press one button and it automatically transers your pictures.  Great camera and great buy.","This is my second digital camera coming from an Epson PC700 1.2 MP that I bought about three years ago and I have been using this camera for the last two weeks while I have been on vacation.<br />For the starting out photo taker, this camera is a full auto camera.  Just point and shoot.  After the shot is taken, the very small LCD lights up showing you the picture that you just took, the F-stop and shutter speed on the top, and if you would like to delete the picture.  After about 3 seconds, the LCD shuts off and you are ready for another picture.<br />For those who want more control about F-stop, shutter speed, and ISO speed it has all of these features also and because of this I am now taking better pictures then ever.<br />I only have a few issues with the camera.  One is LCD.  It is very small compared with other cameras that I have used.  This is not much of an issue for me since it is big enough to do the job needed as an LCD, but it would have been nicer to have a larger one since you can't see much detail on the small screen.  Also the pictures taken tend to be bigger then was is shown in the LCD and viewfinder<br />Another issue is the camera door.  When it is held shut with only a very light spring, which does not offer very much protection for the camera lens.  Because of this, I would suggest that you have a good camera bag to protect the camera and lens.<br />The last issue that I have is the need for the docking station.  I currently do not own one because of the price, but since I can not plug in a AC adapter into the camera I am using the batteries at all times, but at this point I have taken about 100 pictures using both the LCD and viewfinder and the batteries are still going strong.<br />Overall, this is a great camera and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to take great pictures.  I may not need film again.","Apparently this camera receives lots of user compliments ... But browse it carefully you will find that a great percentage of these positive comments are from first time digital camera buyers or users. I wonder whether their opinions will hold true after they have tried other digital cameras on the market. The truth is that there are better choices out there, even at similar prices.<br />First let's look at a myth floating around among first time digital camera buyers:<br />1. Mega Pixel is everything.<br />Since a 3MP camera delivers a higher resolution than a 2MP camera, the picture it takes should be sharper. Sounds right? Not necessarily so. The quality of the output mainly depends on the quality of the lens and grains. A grainy 3MP photo taken with a lower quality lens is not necessarily better sharper than a low noise 2MP photo taken with a high quality lens. It happens that the photo taken with DX3900 contains lots of noise, and the 7 element in 6 group lens might not be as sharp as lens on digital cameras from other vendors in the same class.<br />Ok, now let's talk about the camera:<br />Design and built:<br />DX3900 is very compact. It has a slim plastic body and is suprisingly light even with two AA batteries inserted. It has a sliding door style lens cover and you can only find a few buttons on the camera. (Everything is designed for simplicity).<br />However, this design also brings out the issue of quality of construction. The battery door hatch and compact flash door hatch are extremely fragile. The first time I accidently dropped my DX3900 it broke the battery hatch door and the bottom of the case became cracked. Kodak initially asked $150 for fixing the battery door saying this is a flat fee. After my complaint about the high cost of fixing Kodak suddenly said somehow they calculated it wrong and I was charged $36 instead. I have to admit that their service is pretty fast though. (Two days after the phone call I got the fixed camera back.)<br /><br />The LCD is only 1.5 inch and it is not bright so you might have some problem reading it under bright sunlight. However I like the LCD menu very much, it is so easy to operate even a monkey can find all the options and settings and make the adjustment.<br />Because I like high contrast photo and saturated color I always prefer Kodak color. The DX3900 does take photo with good color. But when I start to compare these with pictures I took with Kodak DC280 and DC290 a while ago I was hugely disappointed:The color of the photos taken with DX3900 looked very plain and dull. And then comes the worst part, the photos also have more noise than those taken with DC280 and DC290s.<br />DC280 and DC290 are old generation 2MP kodak digital cameras. DX3900 is a 3MP digital camera of a new generation.  But everyone who has seen my photos can tell that the 2MP photos I took with the DC280 and DC290 are better than those taken with DX3900. I don't know what Kodak has done to the DX series, they did fix the DC280 and DC290s'low shtter speed problem but they failed to produce a camera that could take better pictures than their old geneation of cameras. And the build quality of Kodak DX series is definately inferior to those \"like a brick\" feeling DC280 and DC290s. I think this is really sad.<br />Do I have anything to recommend with even lower price tag than the DX3900? Sure, Canon A40 and Fuji 2600Z. They are both 2MP, and I think they can compete well with DX3900.<br />Some suggestion for first time digital camera buyers: try and compare several digital camers before you make the final decision. What others are saying might not make sense to you. Try, compare and make decision for yourself.","I was surprised at the quality of picture I got from this camera... The menu system is a bit cumbersome but it is clear. You just have to push a lot of buttons.  All menu items are easy to understand.  The manual is small and efficient.  The one disappointment I have is the editing software.  The croping feature does not allow you complete control. You are confined to a predetermined box.  I have used it with and without the dock and like both ways for different uses.  It's worth the money.","Just bought this camera knowing nothing about them, worried that it was soo plastic, but wanted something the children 9yrs, 13 and 14 years could use on an extended overseas holiday that is easy to use, can hold lots of photos until they return, and would be able to be used for powerpoint or other presentations if needed.<br />So far they have practised using the 8 mb card thing and they will take the 128 mb card thing with them. Was going to get them a card each so they could have their own collection but decided that it would be better to keep the same one in otherwise the plastic might get broken if they are changing the card over.Glad to have read the reviews as I have learnt a lot about the use of it from them, still downloading the manual and haven't read it yet. Was worried that I have paid a lot when I compared digital prices to the non digital of which we have a Pentax that is very old. It still takes fantastic pictures but you have to focus and check the light meter etc, too hard for the little ones to use. Also there will be savings in that we will only print the photo's that are needed. The software supplied needed upgrading . As the hubby is the expert in that area he is downloading this. The 9 year old feels happy that if she messes up the photo she can erase and shoot again. So far, happy with this product and will let you know how the kids handled it when they return.","The camera is easy to use and takes great photos. I use the dock for one touch downloading. Batteries are a problem you cannot use the preview screen more than once. The battery pack from Kodak need to be constantly charged, I have had a little better luck with good quality Ni-Mh batteries over the counter. The Kodak on line help page is absolutely useless.","Excellent Camera, but short life rechargable battery has ruined the fun of using this camera. The battery does not last 5 minutes after recharge, recharge & recharge. The green lite turns on right after two minutes charge. It was charged according to the menu. It is quite frastrate. I love the camera feature and easy to use. Without battery the camera is useless.","Thirty years ago, when I was in the service, I bought a 35mm SLR with all the bells and whistles.  I spent a ton of money (for an enlisted man) on lenses, filters and other accessories.  I would spend several minutes before every shot setting the f-stop, shutter speed, zoom and focus.  I thought that was how photography was supposed to be done.  When I was a child, I thought as a child...now as an adult, I just want the picture.  This camera has the option of setting film speed, f-stop, zoom, etc., or, as I prefer, point and click.  It's the Macintosh of digital cameras.  The quality of pictures is excellent.  And really, isn't that what you want?  I got the docking station, extra memory and an extra battery.  It sets up great for vacation.  We can recharge the batteries at night and the extra 256 MB flash card holds all our pictures from vacation.  This is a great camera \"for the masses.\"","I just received my DX3900 four days ago and so far I'm pleased.  It is my second digital camera.  My first, a Canon Power Shot A50 is still very good and is only 1.3MP.  The Kodak is very easy to use and has a few more features than the older Canon.  The price [I paid was] less than [what] I paid for the 1.3MP Canon two years ago and better than most new 2MP cameras.  I compared lots of cameras before I bought this one.  I really wanted an Olympus, Canon, Nikon or Fuji but kept coming back to this one.  I bought it mainly for the higher pixel count and especially the price.  It doesn't have the features of the others but again, the price was just too good to pass.  I really like the optional lenses that can be purchased and I plan to get them ASAP.  I'm going to try it on one of my telescopes and hope to capture some good astro-images.  I purchased the 128MB card which is a must for this camera because the 8MB card that comes with it holds a miniscule 8 pictures.  I will say that it doesn't feel quite as good as the Canon which has a heavier metallic body.  The Kodak is plastic but again most of the others I have held lately are also plastic.  Also, the display at 1.5\" is a bit smaller than the Canon's 2\" display.  I also find my Canon's card slot and ejection mechanism to be higher quality and I do fear that I'll break the door on the Kodak...but again the price.","This is my first digital camera, and I am extremly happy with my purchase. This is a great value when it comes to cameras. I have used this camera for about a month now and it is great. Easy to use, and gives excellent performance. I got the docking station as well, which makes transferring photos very easy and there is no issue with batteries. With the docking station, you also get rechargable batteries. But a warning on these batteries - you must charge them for the total time recommended, DO NOT USE THE LIGHT AS A GUIDE. When the light goes green, remove the camera and replace it - repeat for the total charge time recommended. If you are not getting the docking station, my camera came with kodak lithium batteries, which has a long life. In addition, this camera uses only 2 batteries. Most other cameras I was looking at used 4! I also got the HP Deskjet 940C, and with photo quality paper, you cannot tell the difference from regular photos. The kodak software that comes with the camera is quite adequate. All in all this is a great camera.","and you will feel like you got a great deal.  The price here is the best I've seen.  As for the camera's functionality, I'd rate it a 9 out of 10.  The pictures are really, really nice.  I cant imagine why anyone aside from a very serious professional would want more out of a camera.  The photos dont have a very wide angle, and the software is a bit \"to simple\" (I think they designed it to be totally user friendly, but for anyone with a good handle on using the computer might desire more features),but dont let that stop you.  You'll use Image Expert or something similiar to spice up your pics anyway. It was my second digital camera.  My first was an Olympus in the same price group.  This beats my old one hands down.","I did alot of research before purchasing this camera.  I read all the reviews and checked out all the specifications.  For the money, this is a great camera. I used this camera for the first time on a trip to Las Vegas.  It worked great. It's easy to use, the ability to see your pictures after you take them is so much nicer than waiting to get your film developed.  The quality of the pictures is outstanding.<br />I highly recommend getting at least a 128mb flashcard.  We took at least 200 pictures and saved 159 on one 128mb flashcard, and never had to change the batteries.  I opted not to get the docking station and don't regret it at all.  Its just as easy using to USB cable to load your pictures.  So far this camera has yet to disappoint me.  Its been money well spent.","We bought this camera about 6 months ago when our daughter was born and are thrilled with the pictures.  We use Shutterfly.com to get prints and people can not believe that they were taken with digital.  The dock is a great accessory and one of the reason I bought the camera.  We do not have to worry about hooking up cables and charging batteries.  Just drop it in the dock and you never have to worry about it.  The one knock I do have against this camera is the battery life.  I have a 64 MB CompactFlash card, which give me a total of about 64 pictures.  At around 25 - 30 pictures that battery is nearly dead.  So, just cary some extra batteries.  Highly recommend for picture quality and easy of use.","I have owned this camera since Nov. 2001.  The camera itself comes with a lithium battery, which is not rechargeable, replacements are expensive.  The camera is simple & enjoyable to use, especially with the optional dock. Rechargeable batteries are also included with the dock & are recharged there.  The camera itself takes good pictures. You can adjust white balance, ISO speed, exposure compensation, color mode, metering, sharpness.  The ISO speed leans to longer exposures, could offer more options for shorter shutter speeds.  The computer software is easy to use to do simple touch-ups to pictures.  The display is somewhat hard to see in bright daylight, but is readable under most conditions. Another nice option is the Travel Pack, which includes a case, plug in charger, plugs for use in other countries, & rechargeable battery pack. The plug in charger comes in handy when you're away from home, since there is no way to recharge the batteries-there is no adapter to plug the camera in to electricity.  I recommend this camera for those folks who are new to digital photography, people who like a point & shoot camera, as well as those who are versed in traditional photography.  Professional photographers would probably like a camera with more options.  Updates for the camera firmware & software are also available from Kodak's web site.  I would also recommend getting at least a 32MB flash card, since the 8MB card only holds 7-8 pictures.","I am just learning about digital camera's, and I like the Kodak brand.  This would be a gift for a high school graduate that is also getting a laptop computer.  I have high hopes that this camera will work with any laptop computer he would get.  I heard that features in a camera to look for are; high resolution, example 8x10 and optical zoom.  This camera has an compact flash expansion slot also.  I have to watch prices along with brand names.  I feel this camera would fit the criteria I am looking for.  This is a camera I would buy for myself.","The price is definitely right. Do your self a favor, get at least a 128 MB CF card with your purchase. At the highest resolution, each picture is almost 1 MB. Also, I would consider either their dock or a CF flash reader for your computer. This thing has no way to hook up an ac adapter, so while transferring pictures, you will be using the battery. If you have a laptop, viking has a nice PC Card adapter that works great. Another thing I am considering is the lens kit for the camera. It is only a 2x optical (but is damn inexpensive) The lens kit includes two close up lens, a telephoto lens, and a wide angle lens, and a case that can hold all this and the camera.<br />I have taken some close up pictures of my orchid, and the results are amazing. This camera has enough pixels to print out a 20 inch by 30 inch print (from Ofoto or iPhoto) at 72 dpi, which was the standard for computer screen resolution for a long time, IOW, your pictures will look great at poster size.","This is my first digital camera after 40 years of 35mm SLR cameras.  Its compact, lightweight, easy to use, and excellent photo quality.  I just took a trip to Paris and shot 300 excellent photos -- many of them hand-held available light night-time shots.<br />The Viking 128MB flash card is a must -- never worry about filling up the camera again!<br />I'm still using this camera after 18 months and I still love it.  Thousands of photos later, it's great.","This is my first digital camera and it's wonderful. The picture quality is much better than I expected, definitely worth going with the 3 mega-pixel. Fine details are excellent. I did not bother to spend the extra money on the camera dock and I am glad I didn't. The USB connection is extremely simple to use. I did purchase the Viking 128mb flash card which will hold 126 non-compressed or 260 compressed pics. Definitely better than the 8mb card it comes with (which only holds 8-15 pics). This camera also has enough extra features that you won't feel cheated or the need to immediately upgrade once you've gotten the hang of using the camera. I was actually surprised at how many extras the camera did come with. The software was average, but does make transfering your pictures extremely easy.<br />I absolutely feel I got my moneys worth.","I was really reluctant to get a digital - but after reading and trying out a few. I am extremely pleased with this Kodak 3900 camera!<br />It is easy and fast. Downloads to the hard drive or on to discs. Great quality and easy directions.<br />We bought the docking station and have really had a blast with what can be done. I would recommend this to anyone who can read and follow directions.<br />Plus anyone trying to hold onto those precious pictures to send on to others, easy. Great email quality. Great printing quality...<br />I could go on but I won't; let your reading do the job.<br />Thank you KODAK!","For average home use this camera is great. It is compact, and super easy to use. However if you want a camera that will give crystal clear vibrant images you will need to get something a little more high end. Check out Kodak's sample images, to get an idea of the quality.","Easy to use, great picture quality. Don't think you can find a better camera for the price.","I just received the Kodak 3900 this week from Amazon.com. Truely impressive.  It is easy to use and has so many great picture options.  I did not buy the camera dock.  Reading previous reviews, which were helpful, made me decide not to buy the camera dock.  I bought a flash card reader, AA rechargeable batteries and charger and a camera case. All together was ... less than buying that camera dock.  For xmas I got a 64mb flashcard.  I recommend spending the extra [money] on that.  The pictures are great.  The lowest quality pics printed out awesome on my HP printer with matte photo paper.  I also have several friends that purchased this Kodak brand and the quality of their prints are excellent.","This is my first Digital Camera and so far I have been very impressed with its performance. I shopped around for about a year looking for a camera that has excellet battery life and takes near 35mm photos. I have not been disappointed in this camera. I recommend the easy share Docking Station for fast photo transfer and a larger compact flash card for greater photo storage capacity. I purchased the Viking 128mb card which allows you to store Approx. 129 high resolution photos.<br />I recommend this camera to anyone who is considering purchasing a digital camera. I gave it 5 stars because, so far, it has exceeded all of my expectations. I can't wait to take it with me to my 40th class reunion. This camera is really a lot of fun to use.","I bought my 3900 two weeks ago,The pictures are fantastic.<br />Easy to use,easy controls on the camera,made for a first time digital camera user.<br />The docking station is a must as well as a larger memory card,mine came with 16Mb (from costco).<br />Compared to my dell computer,and my Lexmark printer/scaner the Tech support from Kodak is outstanding.<br />The wait time is less then 5 min.,and when you get a technican<br />they get right to it.They know their product well,I was very Impressed with the support.","This is my first digital camera.I have used other cameras owned by friends and family,but never was convinced that the technology was refined.<br />Well all that changed when I saw the Kodak line of DX cameras with docking station.<br />I Bought the DX3900 in a  bundle package,it had the camera,docking station,rechargeable batteries,memory card and software.<br />The Docking station is what first got me interested in the camera.The features of the camera closed the deal.<br />I am by no means a guy who take a good picture,but with the DX3900 it seems that you can't go wrong.<br />When it comes to getting the pictures in my computer and e-mailing them,I really think that a monkey would have no problems doing it.<br />The docking station is a must have to make this so simple.No wires hanging around to get dropped off and fall behind desk,just place camera in the docking unit it's as easy as hanging up a phone.<br />To sum it all up I am very pleased wiyh my purchase of the<br />Kodak DX3900 Digital camera.","I just purchased the Kodak DX3900 for $... just three days ago and already have taken over 150 pics. The camera came with the dock station which includes rechargeable batteries.  I purchased a 256K compact flash card for $... which holds 160 pics at the highest resolution setting. Overkill, but now I'm not worried about how many pics I can take and I only take pics at high res.<br />  This is my first digital camera and I am amazed how fast the picture displays on the LCD screen. The screen is small but displays a very sharp picture. Transfering the pics to my computer was extremely easy. The program allows editing, e-mailing, slide show presentation, and photo album creation. I transfered 162 pics at the highest resolution in 3-4 minutes.<br />  If you want a point and shoot camera that is simple to use and takes great pics you won't be disappointed. I would recomend looking for the package deal with the dock station. Being able to recharge your batteries and transfer images at the same time is great.<br />  The battery life seems to be good. I use the flash and review the pics on the LCD screen for every photo and have never come close to a low battery indication.<br />  Nothing comes close to this camera for it's price.","Digital cameras in general are getting better, but you can't beat quality like this. Though I was initially looking at the more talked-about Olympuses and Canons, this camera gives excellent color fidelity, great resolution, and point-and-click ease of use coupled with advanced features.<br />I use Mac OS X, and no software installation is required to use the camera -- it works seamlessly with ImageCapture and the new iPhoto, including being able to control the camera (erase pics from the card, etc) from the iPhoto app.<br />The direct USB connectivity is great. I was able to quickly and seamlessly download the photos without having to use a compactflash adapter, which I suspect will result in longer media life due to the lack of the physical stresses of jamming the card in and out.<br />It looks like a film camera (as opposed to some of the Nikons which twist), and feels comfortable, with a nice weight to it. The body is plastic, but feels fairly solid, though it doesn't feel quite like the most expensve cameras. It feels like the most expensive camera you could buy at a drugstore -- well-put-together, but not top-of-the-line.<br />The ergonomics are very well-designed and easy to understand -- the buttons are well placed for easy operation without any accidental activations. The camera has a built-in battery save feature you can enable which turns it off after a minute of inactivity, and has easy-to-navigate hierarchal menus to control many aspects, like date/time stamp, image quality, and sounds.<br />The image quality is really excellent, better than I expected. Though the 3.1 megapixels is certainly impressive, what's more important is that the quality in those few million pixels is right on, with good range in lights and shadows, good detail (the camera includes macro and distance modes for customizing focus), and very good color fidelity. There are white-balance controls for different lighting (flourescent, tungsten, flash etc) which enhance the color fidelity in usually-tough lighting situations. There is a hint of jaggedness in high-contrast areas, but it's not too distracting. Overall, there is none of the graininess that I've seen with other digital cameras.<br />The camera can take pictures in only 3 modes -- color, sepia, or black and white (some cameras have lots of built-in effects.) For cropping and sharing, it's nice anyway to have a program like Adobe Photoshop Elements, which will let you use all the filters you might want.<br />One of the best parts of this camera is the lens -- you can buy accessories like a telephoto attatchment or a wide-angle, for even more flexibility.<br />I am thrilled with this camera. As an art student, it suits my needs perfectly -- optical zoom and enough pixels to play with were very important to me. However, there are a few cons, which can be expected for all these features at the price. Unlike the top-of-the-line digicams, there's a separate viewfinder (as opposed to true through-the-lens -- parallax problems are slight, but there.) And maybe it's just me, but you can't seem to frame your picture on the LCD screen -- it seems to work only for reviewing photos. I wish there were a power adapter included for seamless recharging. The 8mb included memory is pretty skimpy considering historically-low memory prices -- it holds only 8 hi-res photos. The construction feels solid, but not tops. We'll see how it holds up.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful camera for the price, and Kodak didn't sacrifice image quality to cram in more effective pixels -- the images that come off the camera are ready to go. The additional lenses, ISO and white-balance adjustments mean you can take it further, but it functions as a point-and-shoot easy camera, and with Mac OS X anyway, there's no software you need to install at all. I highly recommend it for everyone from the first-timer who needs room to grow to the advanced amateur without unlimited funds.","I bought this camera about a month ago cause I was impressed with the idea of getting 3MP for only $400.  It was my first venture into the digital camera field, and I didn't plan on doing anything too fancy with it.  I'll run through some of the highs and lows that I discovered.<br />1. 3MP - Well it seems like it's a good deal, but there are a couple things to know.  If you don't ever plan on printing out your pictures, getting anything more that 2MP is a waste.  If you keep the picture at a size where it fills up your screen, even the best monitors don't display better than 2MP.  Besides, a camera needs to have good electronics to process all that information.  When I compared pictures taken with this camera against my dad's DX290 (which is only 2MP), the DX290 photos were much more crisp and vibrant.<br />2. This camera is really, really easy to use.  If you like simple menus with lots of options, this is for you.  There are a lot of adjustable settings, such as ISO, exposure, shutter speed, etc.<br />3. The camera is quick to take a shot, which isn't true with many of the digital cameras.  It is almost instantaneous.  However, the camera is a little slow to record the shot to memory, so you have to wait a little before your next picture.<br />4. The colors on this camera are not very vibrant.  There is a bluish haze that seemed to cover most of my pictures.  If people were more than 5 feet away, their faces looked like they were blue from holding their breath.<br />Overall, I really liked the ease of use and features on the camera.  But when it came down to it, I didn't like the picture quality.  They was definitely something missing.<br />I ended up returning the camera and buying the Canon S110.  It's much more compact, and just about as easy to use.  With respect to picture quality, the Canon is much better with appropriate lighting.  It lacks a little in dim light, but so does the Kodak.<br />In the $400 range, you can also check out the CoolPix 775.  It takes much better pictures indoors than the Canon or Kodak, but it lags behind both outdoors with good lighting.<br />Good luck.","I am very happy with this camera.  The pictures turn out great.  I only have two complaints - one is there is no neck strap, just a wrist strap and two, the batteries seem to drain quickly.  If you get this camera, I'd suggest getting a larger memory card and the docking station.  I leave it on my desk with the camera in it and my batteries are always charged.  I also purchased a  rapid charger from Kodak, which came with another set of batteries.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera.","Fantastic pictures, 3.1 megapixel comes out HUGE on the computer with beautiful quality. Easy to use also, only beef is with the battery indicator system. Low battery is indicated after 100 shots, I think it might be a bad battery though.","I purchased the Kodak DX3900 camera as my first digital camera.  I believe that it was a good choice.  The picture quality is excellent.  I would encourage the purchase of the docking station and an 128MEG flashcard.  The software is seamless and the on-board menus of the camera are intuitive.  I was able to get started right out of the box.  It was much easier than I had anticipated.","This is an excellent camera for those of us who like to have the ability of a point and shot and be able to do some more sophsicated things.  The resolution on the pictures is excellent and the camera is very user friendly.  I recoomend it to anyone who wants to start using a digital camera.","Recently I purchased my Kodak 3900. This was after about 3 months of very intensive study and comparisons of digital cameras. I even bought a \"throw away dig cam\" just to get the feel of a dig cam.I won't mention its name to \"protect the innocent\". Good  American company but very low end camera and I got what I paid for. My Kodak 3900 is outstanding. With a 128MB card I get 129 pics at 3.1 megapixel. Set at 2.2 megapixel I get 170. Enough pics for me in either setting. I bought the camera dock and it works great. The software Kodak gives you is easy and good. I also use Adobe Home Deluxe ver. 4.0 which gives you more features. Once you learn the features of the camera it is really very easy to use. The pics are very detailed and crisp at 3.1. Flash works great. It is fairly small and compact. Also has an optical and dig zoom. .... Both match internet prices. In my opinion this is the best deal on a very good dig cam out there. That is why I bought it. I do not part with my money foolishly. The guys in the big yellow box out did themselves with the 3900. You will be hard pressed to find a better dig cam @ 3.1 megapixel than the Kodak DX 3900 for [the price]. I rest my case!","I consider myself an expert on Kodak Digital Cameras.  I have owned 6 in the last 2 years.  Here they are: DC215, DC280, DC265, DC290, DX3600, and now the DX3900.  The DX3900 is very fast when snapping the photos.  Previous models had about a 1 second delay after pressing the shoot button thus making it difficult to capture those candid shots.  The DX3900 has virtually no delay (about 1/10th of a second).  Plus previewing your shots is significantly faster than previous models.  Obviously this model has a much faster processor.  The ISO Equivalent is 100 thru 400 and can be automatic or selectable.  For those of you who don't know what I am talking about, ISO is basically equivalent to film speed.  ISO 400 allows great pictures in lower light settings.  I love to turn off the flash and take pictures in the evening light or by candlelight.  Something that really can't be done on ISO 100 cameras.  Other bonuses to this model are the high megapixel of 3.1, the easy dock (sold separately), lens slider cover (versus press on cap).  Plus compact flash memory cards are hitting an all time price low.  I just bought 128mb card for $50.  I can take over 130 high quality pictures on this card.  Kodak has definitely outdone themselves on this camera, and at $399 you won't be disappointed.","Bought this camera for one of my users at work. I went with the camera due to Kodak quality that I have experienced with other cameras as well as reviews on Amazon that talked about the ease of setup and use.<br />The reviews were correct, this camera is a breeze to setup and use which is a plus if you are purchasing for a non technical person.<br />The quality of the camera and pictures are top notch. Transfering pictures to the desktop was very easy even without the docking station.<br />If you are looking for a good quality camera that is easy to use this is the one.","This is the first time I have ever bought a digital camera.  I searched and did my research and was pleased to see that Kodak DX3900 was always at the top.  I am very happy with this camera, as before I was a standard 35mm camera user.<br />The ease of the settings on the back is very user friendly and simple.  You can do the point and click or use the LCD viewer for setting up the pics.  Definately if you get the chance buy the docking station as well.  This is an Easyshare product.  You install the software, hook up the docking station and all you do is put the camera on the station, click the button and it instatly uploads the pictures to your Kodak folder.  It also is a recharger for your rechargable batteries.  I just leave it in the dock when I'm not using it.  The software that comes with the camera is great.  You can crop, get rid of red eye, rotate, zoom and has an aray of other features.  What could be more simple.<br />I feel I must correct someone below that stated misinformation about the storage of pictures on the 8meg card that comes with the camera.  It holds 7 pics at <3.1 megapixels> 15 at <3.1 high compressed> 10 at <2.2 megapixels> 13 pics at <1.6 megapixels> and 23 at <.8 megapixel shots>  I plan on purchasing the Viking CF128Meg card, as this is the best buy for the compact flash that I have seen.  Not even the Kodak site has a 128 meg at this low a price.  The only thing I don't like about this camera is its size.  On the small size which for me isn't an issue but my Husband has large hands.  They could have made this camera at least 2\" larger and the LCD viewer is also small.  Otherwise I say money very well spent!!!","If you are looking for a 3+ megapixel camera, which is what experts seem to be recommending as the minimum for truly film-quality images, then strongly consider this model or the Kodak DX3700, which are the cheapest in this megapixel class.  The DX3700 has fewer bells and whistles and cheaper by about $100, so I agonized over paying extra for the DX3900, but I'm extremely happy with it nonetheless.  The autofocus is the best I've had on any point-and-shoot camera, extremely accurate under all light conditions (e.g., midnight photo standing in front of the US Capitol with faces lit only by the Xmas tree); I find there are few wasted shots, even with the luxury of being able to delete the bad ones.  There seem to be only two meaningful differences between the cameras:  (1) the DX3700 zoom is only digital (i.e., electronic), but the DX3900 zoom is both digital and \"optical,\" so the physical lens also has a zoom, which seems to be more accurate and reliable in quality than digital zoom; and (2) the DX3700 has 8MB internal storage plus buy-your-own removable Smart Media cards, which apparently are favored in Japan/Europe, while DX3900 has no internal MB and buy-your-own removable CompactFlash cards, which are used more in USA, but price per megabyte (MB) storage is virtually the same (approx. $1/MB) for either medium.  Clearly, if you have a limited budget, the DX3700 is the best bang for your buck since it produces the same quality of pictures, but with next cheapest camera in the 3+ megapixel class currently around $500, even the DX3900 remains a good deal if you want a better zoom and/or this particular storage medium (I'm indifferent on the latter).  In practice, I have found that the combination of the digital and optical zoom (total 6x) allows for greater flexibility in picture-taking and I suspect the digital zoom alone on the DX3700 (only 3x) would have been less useful; if you take personal photos for posterity (as opposed to for business or temporary purposes), this affects photo quality as much as the number of pixels and should be an important consideration.  Other pluses: the DX3900 is extremely lightweight, but not flimsy, which had worried me, with memories of the old Brownie cameras; indeed, it's small enough to carry in my shirt pocket.  It's also a sleek, good-looking camera, with a lens that automatically retracts into a covered door to protect the lens when you turn the camera power on and off, a useful feature for the careless like me.  I agree with all commenters who say don't bother with the proprietary docking station, which is just a plastic tray for $70.  The docking station is supposed to be one-touch no-brainer transfer of photos to your computer, but it takes just as much work to figure out the tray as to simply connect the camera to your computer with a wire.  Downloading 25-50 pictures seemed to take a minute or less to my computer, which I think is relatively miraculous (compared to how long it takes to download from the Internet if you don't have high-speed access).  The Kodak software you use to view and manipulate the pictures is easy to use; Kodak is the Disney or MacDonalds of the photo world and I think even my mom could figure it out (even if I think she would need help installing it, but that would be even more true of other digital camera manufacturers, I'd bet).  Best feature is the one that lets you save in different formats for e-mailing, a real time-saver when you want to share photos with others electronically.  Also don't let anyone tell you that you need to replace the Kodak paired batteries that come with the camera with Kodak ones; you can use other brands of AA batteries, although the manual says they need to be 1.2 volt (i.e., rechargeable variety) and not the standard 1.5 volt (non-rechargeable) kind; there's little reason not to be rechargeable anyway, which are more cost-effective.  In a few years, you'll no doubt be able to buy 4 or 5 megapixel cameras for the same price, but from what I've read, beyond 3 megapixels, you can't really tell the difference except at huge enlargment sizes (i.e., bigger than 8x11), and most snapshots are only 4x6 or maybe 5x7, so what would be the point?  So, in sum, this is a very good camera value if you don't want to let once-in-a-lifetime moments slip away while you wait for prices on film-quality 3 megapixel camera prices to drop, yet you don't want to spend what Canon, Nikon and others are charging ($500+).","I bought this camera after intense comparisons of the operating manuals for several 2+ megapixel cameras. ..I like to be really informed before I spend this kind of money, and I had absolutely NO prior experience with digital cameras. This camera came in 'hands down' better than all the rest. AND after purchasing I was even more convinced there was no better choice!!!! It has been fabulous to use. So many options, user friendly and my pictures are exceptional! I feel like a pro and found everyone very very impressed with New Year's Day pictures of my sister's wedding!!! And I can trim and edit with ease and confidence. Get the dock, it's well worth the money. I got a great bundled deal on a dutch auction on ebay so check out best pricing. Kodak, I LOVE you.  I've used Olympus and Canon in the past, but I keep coming back to Kodak!","This is my first digital camera and I love it. The quality of the pictures is great, very, very clear and sharp. Not only is it very easy to transfer pictures into your computer with the camera dock (which also recharges your batteries) but I love the way you can then improove your pictures, adjust the size, color, even make them black & white if you like, make slide show. I did purchase 128 MB CompactFlash Card, the 8 MB Card was not enough. The pictures on the web make the camera look larger then it really is, it is nice and compact, easy to fit in your purse (or pocket).","The DX3900 review shakes down like this.  The camera itself is wonderful.  The 3.1 megapixel resolution is unmatched when showing them on your TV for a slide show, or viewing on your p.c..  The options are great too (I just need to start using them ;-)), it satisfies the rookie and the pro in the family.  So the camera itself rates a 9 out of 10.<br />The problems are the ones that eat at your pocketbook:<br />1.  Battery power.  Unless you use rechargeable batteries you'll eat through 2 batteries per 20 pics. that's expensive.<br />2.  If you do have rechargeable batteries, then fine.  Next you need to buy the Kodak camera base to charge those little suckers.<br />3.  Wanna take more than 10 <3.1> megapixel shots...  guess again , the camera comes with an 8 meg compact flash card which holds approx <10> 3.1 shots  <20> 3.1 compressed <15> 2.4 megapixel or <30> .8 megapixel shots.  64 meg compact flash card<br />Granted it's all worth it in the end because your wife is happy and you have 4000 pictures of your new puppy, but it's a warning I think someone forgot to add to the box. Big plusses... The camera itself is great, no film to buy, you only have to develope pics you really want, and the bonus of a big compact flash card to take 80 pictures without reloading ... priceless<br />Happy new year, and good luck shopping.","My wife purchased teh 3900 for Christmas.  I have used film cameras for the past 20 years including some very good SLR cameras.  While not an expert, I take the hobby seriously and was skeptical of digital cameras.<br />This has changed with the 3900.  The photo resolution is excellent.  I took a photo of my daughter's face from 10 feet.  I was able to zoom in on teh face and did not get any grainy lines until I was looking at her eye lashes.<br />The system is very easy to learn and use.  The only thing I do not like is its light weight . . . I keep thinking I will break it if handled roughly.<br />The software package is easy to use from my 2-year old DELL.  Printing with a new CANON printer at 8x10 yields excellent photos.","Based largely on reviews read here, I purchased the DX3900. It performs as advertised. The loading dock system works well. It recharges the supplied batteries, and sends the photos to the screen for immediate viewing, cropping, printing, or emailing. Kodak gave this product some thought, and it shows.<br />This camera has 3.1 metapixels, which is huge for this price.<br />On a personal note, I also own an Olympus D460 zoom, which was also a fine camera. However, when I switched to Windows XP, I needed new drivers which Olympus has yet to supply. Since they think so little of me, I switched to Kodak.","I purchased the Kodak DX3900 2 weeks ago. I was looking for the best buy that I could find in a 3+ megapixel camera with an optical and digital zoom. Not only does the this little Kodak meet my requirements, it exceeds my expectations in advanced features and picture quality!<br />When I bought the camera, I also bought the docking station and a 128M Compact Flash. The DX3900 comes with an 8M Compact Flash, but I am glad I am not limited to its low capacity. I can store about 230 pictures on the 128M Compact Flash at my \"routine\" 1.6 megapixel resolution. The docking station is very convenient and simple to operate. It functions similar to a \"hot sync\" cradle of a Palm Pilot. You drop the camera into the cradle, push the button on the cradle, and presto! Your .jpg image files are then easily transferred to your PC. The cradle also serves as a charging base for the NiMH camera battery pack.<br />Just as a note... not all NiMH batteries will charge in the camera via the cradle. The instruction book warns about this. In order to have batteries that charge, you must use the Kodak brand battery pack (until someone else makes something else that works!) The battery pack has to be installed a certain way. It looks like there might be some kind of mechanism in the camera that is activated via the battery pack. A second battery pack is relatively cheap ($14.95 from Kodak, or less that $10 if you search the web ;-) so I bought one online.<br />I had a \"starter\" digital camera a couple of years ago. The Kodak is much more than the \"next step\"! This new DX3900 is DEFINITELY a quality, feature filled, reasonably priced unit that I am looking forward to using for many years.","I got this camera for Christmas and I absolutely love it. I had a Kodak DC 215 and it was a great camera but the pictures on this camera are fantastic. It is easy to use but lots of options if you want to use.  The pictures are clear and sharp. The price you cannot beat either.","I can't believe that I almost didn't buy this camera.  It is my second digital camera.  My first digital was a cheap Polaroid. I<br />bought it before inexpensive digital photography had really come of age.  It is cool being able to plug this camera straight in to the television or the computer.  The docking station (not included) does sound nice for recharging the batteries but, I doubt that I will get it.  I bought a 128MB card and the USB port card reader.  Combine that with the basic package and I already have multiple ways to get at my pictures.<br />I am so glad that I bought this camera.  Combining it with my CD-ROM burner, I can really enjoy saving those precious family moments.  I've got the EPSON 2880 dpi printer and life is good.  No more rolls of film to get misplaced.  Emailing quality images that I can be proud of cross country is cool too.  The low resolution, poorly lit images from last years digital was almost embarrassing.<br />I was afraid that if I didn't get the most expensive 5.0 megapixel on the market that I might be disappointed, but this camera is more than I hoped for.  Notice there are few bad comments on this camera.  You know the type.  They tell you how qualified they are, how smart they are, and they complain a lot.<br />Great pictures!  Great camera!  Great buy, well worth the money.","I bought this camera for my wife and she loves it. It is very easy to use and takes great pictures. The one-step transfer process is very nice. The supplied Kodak software does not provide all the picture editing capabilities but does supply most of them. One of the other editing program ( from Adobe or other suppliers) can fix the few pictures that need extra help.","This camera is truely the the biggest bang for the buck on the digital market today!!","I am totally hooked!!!!  The image qualities are impressive.  The colors are vivid and perfect.  I am very excited.  I have taken over 100 photos already.  It's a joy, especially if you get the dock.","This is my first digital camera and I can only give the review<br />based on my 2 days usage of this camera.<br />The reason I bought this camera is due to some features such as : easy to use (docking system), high resolution and the price It is one of the cheapest digital camera if you compare with their competitors such as canon etc. I also got a very good deal as I shopped this camera on the last hour before christmas. There are two thing I do not like about this camera<br />1. the camera viewer is very small so it is not easy to use it<br />2. the life time battery that comes with the camera is very poor<br />  but you can buy a better battery for this camera.<br />  I will be buying this battery when there is a need.<br />3. Unlike DX3600, it can not record the movie. But I would<br />  rather buy a very good digital camera for still pictures,<br />  rather have both features but the quality is not so good.<br />I give 4 stars based on the quick usage of this<br />camera (just 3 days). I think my rating will go up or down depending on my experience using this camera in longer time.","I received the DX3900 camera for christmas and it is super nice. The pics are great using the high resolution setting (oh yea, it's 3.1 not 3.3 megapixels like the product description says!). The only complaints I have are first, the lcd screen is a little small, and two, the kodak software is a little slow even though the actual transfer using the USB is fast.  If you have some other CF reader, I highly recommend using it.  These are minor problems however. Now I just need a bigger CF card because of all the pictures I'm taking!!!!","I've had the DX3900 for a week and have found that it provides tremendous picture quality and is very user friendly.  The features built into this camera are normally found in cameras that are $200-$300 more.<br />It is cleverly designed to allow a user to add a lens adapter along with a lens kit giving it wide angle and more zoom capability.<br />The Kodak software included is very easy to use and gives the user editing and resizing capabilities prior to printing, as well as a slide show option which is fun for family and friends to sit around and review the pictures.<br />Low pricing, great pictures, and user-friendly features would make it hard for me to choose any other of the fine, competitive models available over the Kodak DX3900.","I just bought this camera yesterday and couldn't be more pleased. It has tons of features and is simple to use. After reviewing the manual for about 15 minutes, I was off and running, taking close-ups and being amazed with all the features.<br /> I've been a die-hard SLR fan for years, I've finally found a digital camera that's darn-near equivalent to my Nikon in terms of picture quality.<br /> The supplied software is more than adequate, although a good photo editor software package is always recommended whenever you are manipulating digital photos.<br />Overall a great camera, the best in it's price range in my opinion.<br />Follow up to my previous review - I've been using this camera more or less non-stop for the past 3 days and continue to be impressed with the quality and ease of use.  It has NEVER locked up or given me anything less than SPECTACULAR performance.  As for enlargements, I've made some wonderful 8 X 10's, they look awesome.<br />The supplied software works quite well, full screen preview is achieved via the 'full screen' button to the right of the picture or by double clicking on the picture, it's fairly intuitive and easy to navigate once you spend a few minutes working with the software.<br />Finally, the docking station is a nice add-on, no fumbling with cables when you want to download photos into your PC, just place the camera in the dock and push a button, the rest is automatic and FAST.  The docking station comes with an extra set of batteries, nice to have an extra charged set in the camera bag.  The docking station also doubles as a battery charger, another added bonus, the camera is always fully charged and ready.<br />I'm even more impressed with this camera now than I was the day I purchased it, an outstanding product from the folks at Kodak.","Easy to use, takes great pictures, and with the docking station makes transferring images simple. I love this camera. I use it for my business to document contracting work and it does the job.<br />If you just want to take excellent pictures without a lot of fuss, Buy it! If you want fiddle and be a pro buy something else!","This camera reqires a docking station. Why not be a good sport and add it, for a few dollars more, and some stable software, then that would be a clean package and a great buy or gift.","I have owned 3 digital cameras, and purchased them for work as well. I can honestly say that this is by far the best. It is small, light, has more than enough features, is the simplest to download with its port, and can equal cameras costing twice as much in picture quality. You cannot get more value in a digital camera today. Keep up the great work Kodak!","I just got this camera tonight and I love it.  The point and shoot feature is great.  My husband loves it because all he has to do is push the button and the picture is taken.  This camera is loaded.  This is my first digital camera and it was a breeze to use and the software loaded in great.  The instruction book is great also - at least it comes with one.  The pictures print out great too.  I would recommend this to anyone.","I normally don't write reviews, but after reading that last one slamming this great camera (for all the wrong reasons), I felt compelled.<br />The DX3900 was the only camera I could find that had optical zoom AND 3 megapixel resolution (...).  It's pretty simple to use (especially if you read the instructions and realize that many of the \"problems\" described by one reviewer are configurable and/ or the way it's SUPPOSED to work.  Jeez!)<br />What's especially nice is the memory media (CompactFlash) which is available in sizes up to 512 MB (will hold over 700 pics at top resolution).<br />The digital screen is a bit \"stuttery\", but it IS color and will reflect whatever mode you have it in (black/ white, sepia).  The camera also has a lot of adjustable features INCLUDING whether the zoom pauses when it changes from optical to digital zoom.<br />The lens protector closes \"automatically\" when you shut the camera off, which is cool.  Downside is that it opens when you turn it on, even if you're just turning on to view pics you already took (it would be nice if the cover closed while in \"play\" or \"setup\" mode).<br />I haven't bought the dock yet, but plan to.  One button downloading plus getting your batteries recharged adds to this camera's practicality.  Without the dock, your battery options are still pretty wide.  The camera comes with a long-lasting lithium battery pack, but can also use Ni-MH or tried and true AA batteries.<br />This camera also has a decent number of adjustable photo options such as exposure compensation, exposure metering, and multiple resolution settings, including a lower-res mode that allows you to take a \"burst\" of photos (several in rapid succession... COOL!)<br />By the way, for those who don't know, you CANNOT show digital zoom through an optical viewfinder, so don't be disappointed when you have to view the digital zoom through the screen.  Also, the higher resolution is for PRINTING pictures, not viewing them on screen... a task handled well by any low res jpeg producing hardware.<br />Again, (...): 2x opitcal zoom, 3x digital zoom (6x total), 3.1 megapix, and a slew of cool options, I looked and looked, and couldn't find a better deal!","This is my 4th digital camera, the last three being Kodak cameras. I chose Kodak for its reputation and positive reviews, especially as to color quality. I was looking for a 3+ megapixel camera and chose the DX3900 because 1) it had an optical zoom (although I wish it had 3X instead of 2x) 2) It was one of the cheapest cameras in its class 3) Kodak reputation. I was put off at first by the plastic case, but the lighter weight is really an asset. Be careful, however. The lightness caused me to produce some blurry photos until I figured out I was in my heavier camera mode from my previous DC265. The 8 megabyte card is a joke - only 7 pictures. The 3.1 compressed mode doubles your pictures, but Kodak tells me not to use it if you intend to print your photos---Web use is just fine. You'll need to budget for at least a 128 or 256 Mb card. The first set of batteries lasted for 275 pictures, 20% of these were taken with flash. Like most cameras in its class, the LCD display is impossible to see in any kind of daylight; the optical viewfinder is a must -- also saves on battery life. Some reviewers complained about the lack of advanced features, but the basics are there along with a surprising number of manual settings (shutter speed, ISO, exposure compensation, 4 flash modes, B&W, sepia, etc). You don't really need the docking unit. (...)","I got this camera a week back and I am completely hooked to it , it gets such a clear picture that to quote an example when I took my wife's closeup and I can actually count some of the hairs that have fallen over her face while editing the photo.<br />Transfer is so easy with camera dock, its totally worth it<br />I love my camera","I previoisly owned a DX3700 and loved it. I should of bought this one in the first place! The picture quality is outstanding. I love the display in the LED readout. You can adjust picture quality, lighting, and special effects. This camera is loaded.<br />I bought the optional dock and it is great for people like me who know little about digital photography. After your pictures are taken, simply set the camera on the EasyShare Dock push the button and the pictures are uploaded to your computer ready for emailing or printing. It's great. One tip. Using the 3.1 pixel setting will take up more room on your photo card and also reduce battery life. Use only for the most important pictures. For others, use the lower setting. Pictures still look great.","This is my first digital camera, although I have been taking photos (many years professionally) for more than 15 years with 35mm film cameras.<br />I have to say that this camera, after just two weeks, has exceeded my expectations. I wanted a camera that could replace my beloved Olympus Stylus as a point and shoot camera. It easily does that. In fact I find that I can use it much like I did my beloved Leica M rangefinder camera. Any digital consumer camera today still does not rival even the cheapest p/s film camera. But the advantages of a digital camera more than overshadow any image quality gap between film and digital cameras.<br />Here are the strengths of this camera (in no particular order):<br />1. Takes non-proprietary batteries. DO get rechargable NiMH<br />batteries. Camera uses 2.  (...))<br />2. Flash can be turned off. I rarely use the flash for a natural look when in \"lecia-type\" shooting situations. Good fill flash.<br />Flash is far enough off axis so that red eye doesn't seem to exist.<br />3. Can set EV +- 2 stops for exposure control.<br />4. Can set shutter speeds down to 16 seconds. Great for low-light shooting.<br />5. Metering system is very, very good in general. can also do spot metering.<br />6. camera is not too small or too big. it makes it easy to take anywhere and not be a burden.<br />7. Cover protects lens when camera is turned off.<br />8. Very good image quality<br />9. Good software on camera and loaded onto computer. camera is<br />intuitive to use.<br />10. Macro mode<br />Misses:<br />1. some might need more than 2x zoom.<br />2. Software does not work under Windows95<br />3. No neck strap. Just wrist strap supplied.<br />4. Only 8mb card supplied with camera.<br />5. shutter is responsive with no big lag from the time the shutter is pressed to when the image is taken, but it takes about 6 seconds to write the image to disk before you can take the next picture. (unless you use the .8mb burst mode)<br />More Advice:<br />Don't bother buying the dock. USB cable alone is fine for<br />transferring images. Save the dock money and buy a bigger compactflash card and rechargable batteries.<br />This is a lot of camera for the money. Hopefully it will hold up<br />over the next few years until it's time to buy the next generation<br />of digital camera. Good luck! Hope this helps.","The DX3900 is my second digical camera.  Just received it and I am delighted with the picture quality.  My computer is three years old and I recently upgraded to Windows Me.  I was concerned about attaching the camera, docking station.  All worked without a problem.  I have only used the camera in the auto mode, but there is so much more you can do with the camera. The camera dock is worth [dollar amount].  Transfer pictures in seconds and what a way to have the DX3900 always charged.  I purchased a 128 CF card.  The 8 CF card that comes with the camera is useless.  I recommend buying the Viking 128 CF card.  It works great with the DX3900 and is much less expensive then the Kodak CF card.  For [dollar amount] you can not find a better deal or picture quality.","I just bought this camera a few days ago. It is my first digital camera. It is very easy to use right out of the box, and if you take the time to read the manual there are many advanced features too.<br />The battey lasts along time, I bought a 128mb flash card and took almost 200 pictures, downloaded them to my computer and I am still using the same batteries.<br />The quality of the pictures is awsome. It is also very easy to grip. You need to use the LCD to use the digital zoom but it is not a huge inconvenience.<br /> If you are taking several pictures in a row there is an 8 picture burst, but they also process very rapidly at the regualr speed. So if you are trying to take several pictures you dont have to wait and wait like with some other cameras.<br /> The software that comes with it is very easy to use for printing the pictures, but for more advanced features I would use Adobe Photoshop.<br />All in all I thought this was an outstanding camera for the first time user as well as having many more advanced features for people who wanted them.","I bought this in a hurry. I was saving for a Sony CDR-300, and my sister went in to labor, and I was in charge of new baby pics. THis was the nicest camera I could afford at the store. As it turns out it was a great investment. It took me about 5 minutes to learn, and the Included Li battery pack lasted for about 350+ pictures and a lot of time using the LCD, which usually kills stuff on most other cameras I have used. I would lastly like to reemphasize that it took me all of 12 seconds to learn, and with XP the camera interface solved itself, I bought it two weeks ago, and still haven't installed the software. Woohoo.","I am in charge of purchasing all new technology for my office, and one month ago, I bought 4 of the Kodak DX3900s for my office.  What a great camera!  The photos are great. This is the 3rd set of digital cameras I have purchased for my office in the past 5 years, and digital cameras have come a long way.  6 months ago I purchased an olympus for [a high price] and that camera had too many bells and whistles that nobody in the office could figure out. This camera is simple. All I do is just leave it on the highest picture quality setting, insert the 128MB card that I purchased seperately and I can take up to 129 pictures using the flash on one battery charge!  I \"borrowed\" the office camera that I purchased for the last 2 weekends when my family and I visited the Shenendoa National forest.  Wow!!  The pictures could not be any better.  My husband and I are planning on purchasing one of our own!!  I strongly suggest this camera to anyone who is purchasing a new digital camera.","...You can't imagine this DX3900, a cheaper model, is even better than my DX4800, 1st winner in picture quality by PC World for many months this year. I've taken 271 pictures (LCD panel off) with the lithium battery (equivalent to 2 AA batteries) included in the package and it is still going strong. I'm a picky person and I seldom give anything a five-star rating, but this Kodak has simply overwhelmed me. Now you have to have a professional medium-format traditional camera to beat this Kodak. I bet you can't find a better digital camera in picture quality at any price.","Although the DX3900 is very easy to use, unless you are a complete novice with computers, it seems that the extra \"ease\" is not worth the price premium you pay. After all, with most digital cameras, you simply plug in a USB cable and open the supplied software - this takes about 10 seconds. So with the DX3900 you save maybe 5 seconds every time you download your pictures.<br />Having said that, the 3900 is a very capable and respectable camera for the market in which it competes. Resolution is pretty good, although jpeg artifacts become visible in all the but least compression settings (whereas canon and sony cameras seem to do a better job with compression). Color accuracy is very good, and skies come out vivid blue. The zoom lens works nicely, and startup time is fast. The LCD is smooth and fluid, although not as bright as I am used to from canon and sony.<br />If you are purchasing this camera for a beginning computer user, or if a bit of extra ease of use means more to you than saving a bit of money, then this is a great camera. If, however, you don't mind spending a few extra seconds, this camera is probably a little too over-simplified; you could spend less or get more features for your money elsewhere. Conclusion: for the market for which this camera is targeted, this is a very good camera.","Great Camera! This is my first digital camera - I am very impressed. I was taking pictures right out of the box, without needing to read the manual. The menus are easy, intuitive and nice to look at. I did purchase the docking station along with it. It is great one touch and the photos are uploaded in seconds (along with easy battery charging). The pictures look great and print great.<br />It would have been nice if it was packaged with a larger CF than 8mb. But that is my only complaint. I highly recommend this camera.","i had used several digital cameras. but Kodak DX3900 is simply the best. easy to operate and w/ professional feature that i want from a camera.","I have been using this camera for about a week. It takes very sharp and colorful images. It is extremely easy to use as a point and shoot and there are also settings to refine your images under different situations (lighting,compression,EV,ISO,etc.).I am amazed at the picture quality for such an easy to use camera. I highly recommend this camera for anyone that wants to jump in to digital photography. It produces comparable results to 35MM film cameras and maybe even better."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P20","amazon_reviews":["If using regular AA batteries you're camera will run out of life before your disk runs out of space, try getting rechargables.

I'm thinking about selling mine one of these days.  But I won't get in any hurry unless I've got the bucks to replace it with a DSLR.  Outside of that, I'm not so sure it would be worth spending the money for something with more MP's for non-professional use.  If I got another point and shoot, I'd only want one that was more compact.  This one is a bit on the large side.

VERY happy with purchase.","good for an older model","What kind of memory card would work for it","Great","Great camera!!!","If your someone looking for a camera with decent quality then this is the camera for you..let me just say i paid 30 $ for this camera and i was scared at first cause of the price but I'm happy with the result.,The focus on mine was not the best but i was able to move past that.","I've had this camera since sometime around 2001, I think.  Now the megapixels are way up there and this one is only 4.1.  But I have to say, the quality pictures I've gotten out of this camera can certainly rival those of much more expensive cameras with much higher MP's.  It must be the Carl Zeiss lens.  I'm thinking about selling mine one of these days.  But I won't get in any hurry unless I've got the bucks to replace it with a DSLR.  Outside of that, I'm not so sure it would be worth spending the money for something with more MP's for non-professional use.  If I got another point and shoot, I'd only want one that was more compact.  This one is a bit on the large side.  This is a good one to get for a 2nd camera or for the young, budding photographer in your family (and if they lose interest, you didn't spend much.)","Fast delivery... VERY happy with purchase.","Great price for the camera!","The camera itself is real nice and so far takes excellent pictures I am disappointed in the seller because the camera did not come with a memory stick and I had a real hard time finding one.and this Sony DSCS85 will only take up to 128mb memory stick<br />which was real disappointing And the advertisement did not point this fact out.and because it takes a memory stick which they dont make anymore everybody wants big bucks for used  memory sticks which stinks.","I love this camera but I am having problems with focusing and cannot find either a manual or CD for my DSCS85.","I can tell the senders of this camera took very good care of it. They sold us an excellent, yet affordable, durable, high quality digital still camera, with a number of accessories, and a very thoughtful letter with helpful information about it to boot. I got one of these for my oldest daughter a couple of years ago, which she still uses a lot -- to take pictures, videos, and even create short claymation skits. My younger daughter then wanted one just like it, and I guess we just had good timing or something, because this one just happened to be available, affordable, and in very good condition. So I got it, and my younger daughter is also quite happy with it. One thing we all like about it, is that there is no need to continually buy batteries to use it. Instead, you just charge an internal battery by plugging it in, which can be done many times ... for years, before needing to replace the battery. When you compare the inconvenience, financial and environmental cost of having a camera that you have to constantly buy new batteries for at a few bucks or more a pop to use, compared to a camera like this, which you only have to buy one battery for at about $50 one time every five or so years and it only has to be plugged in for a while to use it ... well I think it should be quite clear that a Sony Cybershot digital still camera is the way to go -- for beginners, and maybe even professionals.","Even though it is now 2011, the Sony DSC -S85 is a unique digital point and shoot camera that allowed for manual settings and  f stops as low as 2.1.  I used this basic camera to take extremely good low light action sports (volley ball photos). The big glass on this camera makes it stand out from all the hundreds of similar vintage digital cameras that are essentially worthless because of comparable low megapixels but puny glass. this camera is a steal in 2011 just for the creative opportunities from the maual settings and zeiss lens.","For those of us who are technically challenged, this camera is a good start. It has many features. The instruction book is easy to follow. The picture quality is excellent.","This was my first digital camera, I've had it since 2001 and have taken over 3,000 pictures with it.  The image quality is excellent, My biggest complaint is that the auto focus is sometimes erratic.  I've had pictures sometimes end up out of focus for no reason, and it's not always obvious looking at the display.  Battery life is good.  Camera has a good selection of manual features, Auto white balance setting consistantly gives great results,  Build quality is excellent, The shutter lag is slow compaired to newer cameras.  A very good camera at it's time, Image quality is as good as most newer P&S cameras.","I got this camera as a gift 4 years ago and it's seen a lot of use since then. This was a great first time camera. I took wonderful pictures with its automatic settings and even better ones once I learned how to adjust them to the scene.<br /><br />Currently I'm upgrading. While I love this camera, there are much better prospects on the market now.<br /><br />This camera has downsides that come with age:<br /><br />-Size & weight are too much. It easily gets in my way.<br /><br />-Turn on time and delay between pictures have both made me miss many spur of the moment shots<br /><br />-Battery is big and obsolete. My biggest problem right now is I can't find the charger and if this camera only used AAs it wouldn't be such a big deal. When I can charge the batteries, they don't last very long. I always need to carry two fully charged ones if I'm going to be out for a day.<br /><br />Still, this camera taught me a lot about digital photography with just playing around with it. I don't think I'd have picked anything else that was out there 4 years ago.","If you're in the market for a digital camera, there has never been a better time to buy. The high tech electronics marketplace is absolutely glutted with digital cameras; nifty features and consumer options are way up, and prices are way down. Currently available digital camera models cover the resolution range from less than one megapixel to almost eight megapixels. An average user really only needs 4mp as this is great quality for enlargements up to 11 X 14. Many newer cameras on the market are overrun with too bells and whistles that make it difficult to find a camera that takes truly great pictures consistently. The DSC-S85 does just that, great pictures consistently and with no problems. I have had my camera for 2 years and never had any issues with blurring or poorly lit photos. The settings are straight forward and the camera is easy to use.<br /><br />The DSC S85 has a Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar 3X zoom lens, an accurate auto focus system, an optical view finder, and a 1.8-inch LCD display, all in a compact package that looks and performs like an upscale 35mm point and shoot. The 4.1 megapixel CCD provides superb images (2272x1704 pixels) that actually get pretty close to the resolution of a scanned 35mm negative (3000x2000 pixels) giving digital photographers excellent image quality.","This is an excellent automatic camera.  My husband bought it for me 2 years ago & I've been very happy with it.  My only complaint is that the manual focus is pretty useless because using the display is an unreliable source & the viewfinder doesn't work for focus.  I haven't had much of a need to use the manual focus however as almost every image turns out crystal clear!","This camera does what smaller cameras cannot.  It takes great pictures indoors and in poor light.  It does so because it has a large lens and a powerful flash.  Smaller cameras, having smaller flashes and lenses, can work well outdoors but can't compete with this one indoors or in low light.<br /><br />The problems with this camera are:<br />1) It's too big to fit conveniently in your pocket.<br />2) There's an annoying delay of up to 1 second between when to press the shutter release and when the picture is taken.<br />3) It takes several seconds to turn on.<br /><br />These three issues can cause you to miss a lot of pictures.  So I keep this camera at home for family shots, where its strengths are important.  If I'm going out during the day, when lens size and flash aren't important, I bring a smaller camera.","(...).<br />Here's my review.  The image quality is excellent.  There is very good color balance.  I also like the excellent battery life (This is true for Sony products). It's easy to transfer images to the PC using USB. It has a very good lense (Carl Zeiss). The menu is user friendly.<br />The slight drawback is speed of operation.  This may be true for most digital cameras. It's difficult to take good action shots as there is a time lag between shots (when compared to an analog SLR).<br />Bottom line is...Very good value for your money in the 4 MP range.","I love this camera. I had it for over a year.  And I am never with out it.  Even my 6 year old can use it. It's the best camera I have had and durable beyond my comphernsion...","I just purchased this camera for my parents--they're currently using a 2.0 MPixel camera and it's just time for them to \"move up.\"  I've owned six digital cameras (dating back to 1999) and I can say that this camera is as good as any I've owned.  Image quality is excellent, battery life is adequate (I imagine that it could be improved by using an external flash).  Newer 4 MPixel cameras may be a bit faster and cheaper, but many don't have much in the way of optics.  Highly recommended.","A must buy. I cant say anything bad about it. Love the battery life, uses camcorder battery. I would highly recommend it. Excellent picture quality.","This camera has made me a better photographer.<br />It is easy to use and has an on-screen menu for changing options quickly. You can set this camera to automatic, or you can use it in aperture-priority, shutter priority, or manual mode.<br />The truth is that this camera has so many options that I haven't explored all of them yet, though I've owned it almost a year.<br />It is a real keeper.","This is the second digital camera I've owned. I started with a kodak, but about a year and a half ago I was given this camera as a gift as an upgrade. I could not be happier. It has everything that i was looking for, more complexity so i could begin to learn more about digital imaging, but with simplicity so i was not overwhelmed. I personally don't think that this is a good camera for beginners, so if you're looking for simple point and shoot you should go somewhere else.<br />My Ratings:<br />Ease of Use: 3.9 out of 5 --> I'm not an expert so I had to learn quite a bit before I could begin. My advice is to test all the settings out on one subject to get a feel for what everything does.<br />Features: 4.5 out of 5 --> I wish there was a better zoom, and faster shutter speed, but other than that it is great.<br />Image quality: 4.7 out of 5 --> 4 megapixles is going to get you great pictures. You just need to be able to get all the feature combinations correct to get ideal pictures.<br />Value for Money: 5 out of 5 --> You're gonna get a great camera. Definitly worth the money.","Camera is good overall, but very slow. I am a semi-professional Photographer and I primarily use this camera for family candids and 2 out of 5 images is blurry and/or a picture of a child's head, etc. The camera lens is very sharp (has a Zeiss lens) when it wants to be, but the camera is slow. The delay definitely gets in the way and I find that half of my pictures are of the children's head due to them moving, etc. I do not recommend this camera for family candids or portraits. At the same time, this camera is great when objects don't move and takes amazing close-ups of still-lifes and nature shots.","I'm a pretty experienced photographer.  It was my major in college, and at times I've had to do it for a living.  The Sony s85 will yield good, sharp prints up to 8x10\".  It may go larger, but I've never tried it.  As with any digital camera, you'll get better prints by taking them into Photoshop and setting the levels and color balance.  Right out of the camera, your photos will look quite a bit better if you use aperture prioity with the one-touch white balance.<br />The Zeiss lens is good and sharp, fast, and has good bokeh (meaning that out of focus areas, like the background, are pleasing to look at).  I wish it would stop down farther than f8, but nothing's perfect.  The lens seems to perform well throughout its range of apertures and focal lengths.  It has a little distortion at the wide end, but I can usually live with it.<br />Construction of the camera is very solid except for the little door on the side of the camera.  Mine's about to break off, but I don't care about stuff like that.  If you do, be careful not to drop it with the little door open, like I did.  The controls on the camera are very intuitive and easy to navigate.  I never have read the manual.<br />The battery life on the s85 is amazing.  I almost always have the LCD on, yet I never have run out of power.<br />There is one area in which this camera is seriously lacking: speed.  It takes a little too long for the camera to boot, and I've missed a few shots that way.  Mainly, though, the problem is the shutter lag.  If you really know how to use the camera, you can get around it by shooting wide shots in full manual mode.  That way it will fire the shutter reasonably quickly upon demand.  Still, if I know my subject's is potentially moving, I will put this camera down and grab another.<br />It's also a little noisy in the blue channel at the higher ISO's.  That's normal for a consumer digital, though.  If you can, shoot with it set to 100.","I've owned this camera for about 6 mos now, and I'm completely in love with it. I originally learned photography on a standard camera - and this does nearly everything i ever did with it - and its digital. im very happy with the interface, and with a 128 MB memorystick, you're going to be able to take 65 high quality (fine at 2278x1704) pics. you can fit ~400 at 640x480. i would strongly reccomend this camera for the price","I HAVE HAD THE CAMERA FOR A WHILE AND HAVE HAD A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.  THE CAMERA IS EASY TO USE EVEN FOR A BEGINNER LIKE ME.  IT ALSO TAKES CLEAR PICTURES.  THE ONLY THINK I DISLIKE IS THE PRICE OF THE MEMORY STICK.","Fast Delivery and product is just as describe. But I thought product was in great quality instead of good.","Simply the nices camera I've ever owned.  Easy to use and lots of fun.","I have had this camera for about 6 months. Great quality. I am not a professional, so I have not used all the features, but the pictures that I have taken are very sharp. I am very impressed by the batterey life as well. I had a smaller camera, but I misplaced it. This is large enough that I will not.","I've had this one for seven months now, this is my fifth Sony digital camera, I've loved each one, but systematically upgraded in resolution (1, 2, 3, 3 again, now this 4 megapixel).  The quality of the photos continues to amaze me.  I've taken shots in complete darkness, only relying on the AF illuminator to view my subjects, the flash makes the photo look like it was taken in daylight.  The size of the LCD makes reviewing photos easy for older relatives, they don't have to squint like some of the other P series Cybershots.<br />The memory stick that comes with it, a 16 mb is not enough if you plan on taking good resolution photos.  Invest in a 128 mb, you can usually find them for under $50.  The battery life is solid, I always take shots with the LCD on, and I still get enough life to take 300 shots before needing a charge.<br />My father-in-law is using a Nikon Coolpix 885, and is going to get rid of it to buy a DSC-S85.  The Nikon has horrible indoor quality, the flash is weak, and it has a pinkish red hue to most shots.  Though now discontinued, we found him a DSC-S85  from Circuit City where they searched the company-wide inventory to find a store who had it in stock.  Circuit City has been the best retailer for my needs, their staff is always friendly and they don't jam that extended warranty down your throat like Best Buy does.<br />I was tempted to look into the new DSC-V1, but I don't really think 5 megapixel is necessary for anyone who prints 8 x 10's as the largest size.  Also, at $699, that's a bit pricey compared to the $449 for the DSC-S85 (if you're lucky enough to find any more).<br />I've always been a Sony fan, and this camera will make any photographer get hooked on Sony products.  Go buy this camera!","Not one heavily into photography, this camera surpassed my expectations tenfold! A must have is the larger memory stick, THEN you can get as adventurous as the imagination allows. Detail? With 4.1 megapixels NOTHING escapes capture! Fine detail especially when you set the resolution high. Just compliment this camera with a good bubblejet photo printer and you can rival any professional easily. Notwithstanding the camera allows the pro to get technical with the desired results. Price? Definitely worth it! If your budget can don't quibble; just do it.","I've owned the Sony Dscs85 for about a year and have found that it produces excellent pictures at all resolutions! It is easy to use and very straight forward in its operation! The only negative aspect of this camera, that I have found is that it is a little slow between shots and needs a short time to recover! The camera is very well built and sturdy!","For the likes of me, an amateur but interested photographer, this is as good as i could ever want - sturdy and robust so can bash around in a rucksac, super fine detail and resolution, simple to use and great results. Was a bit pricey when i bought it in Singapore a year ago but still with over 1000 terrific photos sitting on my Mac, (and one featued on BBC News website!!) its a great purchase.","Sony really packed the features into this camera,they made it  compact so I can carry it and not look like the news team.  The zoom lens retracts into the body and it is just like having a small disposable camera but having the features of a professional 35mm.  When you are outside in bright sunlight the viewfinder is very handy and it works like a thru the lens viewfinder, that shows the zoom effect.  You can program the camera for the settings you want and you can edit your shots in the camera.  Like all cameras the included 16 MB memory stick is not large enough, so I purchased the sony 128 MB memory stick and I can shoot all day depending on the setting I use.  The icons are easy to understand, a flower for macro mode a clock for the timer and etc.  The LCD screen was my only concern with it getting scratched, so I purchased PDA screen protectors to solve that issue.  I have taken a lot of shots at dusk and the photos are great without the flash.  The new lower price makes this an even  greater buy.  Our christmas photos and winter photos at seven springs were great and being digital I saw the photo on the screen in seconds.  Direct usb cable from computer to camera  is great, I make a copy to a backup cd and then I go to [the store]  with my memory stick and insert it into their machine and in an hour I get my photographs for [.$$] per photo.  You can also send your photos over email.","First of all, its probably pretty late for this review, given I've had this camera for a while, but, oh well I'm finally getting around to it.<br />Between work and personal use, this is probably my 6th or 7th digital camera, albeit mostly for casual use.  I used everything from Sony & Olympus, to Canon, Nikon, and Leica.  I have to say that I love this camera.<br />First of all, I think that 4 Megapixels is plenty of resolution for most non-pro users.  Some people complain that this camera doesn't have as many \"manual\" features as, for example, comparable Nikon Coolpix cameras (which I also have: great pics too, but, much more difficult to use).  Its true it doesn't have every manual setting imaginable.  But I believe that 90% of the users will utilize at most 10% of those advanced features regularly.  And with this camera, all of the functions are very intuitive and easy to use.  Its pretty well thought out.<br />Besides, a) advanced users know exactly what they are looking for in a camera, and b) good photographers can take nics pics with just about anything.  I believe this camera really appeals to those who value simplicity, want a bit of flexibility, and are unwilling to sacrifice quality.<br />Its got plenty of features, enough manual settings for most, video & voice capability (you can take as long of a mpeg as you have memory, which is uncommon), external flash shoe.  Adapters for Telephoto & wide angle are available if you really want it, but, I've found that the 3x optical & additional 2x digital zoom usually suffice.  I think the bottom line, though, is that it takes gorgeous pictures with little or no effort.  This is a camera that anyone can use, and use well.  You can't go wrong with the Zeiss optics, which are exceptional.  I've been particularly impressed by the quality of pics under poor/difficult light conditions, which typically wreak havoc on digital cameras.  The battery life is better than most.  And, the fit & finish of the camera body is comparable, or superior to anything out there.<br />On the down side.  I agree that the memory stick is not the most desirable of media types.  I'd love to be able to use a microdrive on this thing.  But, memory is [low cost] these days, and I generally carry a couple of sticks when I expect heavy use.  Besides, a 128mb mem stick provides plenty of storage under normal use.  You might even have room to take a few short mpeg video.","I got this camera just before I deployed to Kosovo.  It was fairly easy to use, compact enough to fit in my cargo packet, and pretty tough.  I have dropped it, exposed it to wind and weather, and carried it on patrols through cities.  It keeps on clicking.  I bought it aware that it came with a small memory stick and a single battery.  I would have given this camera five stars if it came with a 128Mb Memory Stick.  I bought two 128mb Memory Sticks and a spare battery from the outset.  You have to factor this into the price of the camera -- it was worth it.  Battery life was already long (2+ hours of constant use) and the second battery makes it ridicuously long.  With the two Memory Sticks I can take pics all day long.  Simple and rugged, it delivers good pics.  I have recommened it to several friends who have bought it and been very satisfied.","I have had this camera for about a month and I can't say enough good things about it. This is my third digital camera and by far the best. The pictures come out crisp and clean with vivid color. I also like being able to take more than 90 seconds of video (up to 30 minutes with 128 MB stick). Great beginner or experienced photographers camera.","My other camera is a point and click, so take this for what this is worth. For my level of takin pictures there is way more features then I know what to do with. The controls are pretty straight forward, I was able to get move of the cameras functions down without reading the manual. I personally like the \"two-thumb\" layout, if anyone has played NES or PS, this should feel pretty natural.<br />At first I was turned off by the small memory stick mainly because it meant i would have to go out and buy one with more capacity. You could get away with putting off the purchase of a memory stick by lowering the resolution of the pictures it takes for now, alteast until you get comfortable using the camera. I found myself doing almost no alterations to the photos other then reducing the size and minor touch ups in photoshop, with that said though, I will definitely be buying a larger mem stick more so now that the prices of them are coming down.<br />Speaking of mem stickes, I was very surprised by the actual size of the stick. Most pictures I have seen make them look large, and I did not want to have to lug around bulky mem sticks but infact they are smaller than a stick of gum.<br />One thing that bothers me about the camera is the short length of the USB cable. The USB port on my computers are on the back with the computer under my desk. Because of the length of the cable, the camera has to sit on my computer under my desk making it harder to work with.","This is a really great camera for both beginners and novice photographers.  It will suit the needs of just about anyone.  I have had mine for about 5 months and it has been great for me.  The pictures it takes are always clear and full of detail.  Where most digital cameras dont pickup up the background details, this one does.  The only complaint that I have is Sony's pricing for there memory sticks.  You can get \"off\" brand memory sticks from electronic stores for about half the price. Other than that, this is a great camera and it won't be obsolete anytime soon like most other products.","I'd give my eye teeth for this little beauty!  I am an artist and of all the digital cameras I have just researched and seen...I'll take this one!","My Canon Rebel was my best friend. It was a love affair from the very beginning. Easy to use and great quality... but alas, the cost of developing film for this avid amature photographer began to take its toll. Also, as a web designer, scanning tons of pictures seemed like a waste of time. I wanted a digital. I needed a digital.<br />I experimented with camera after camera and after several disappointing relationships I was ready to give up. No one could replace what I had with my Canon.<br />And then I saw her. Sleek, black, could it be?...I have to admit I was nervous. Would it be another waste of time and money?<br />I'll admit, it took a little getting used to. The settings can be a little tricky and not all of our first outings were successful- but there was always a glimmer of hope. There was always one or two shots that would give me a peek into her true potential. Finally after owning my Sony DSC-S85 Cyber-Shot for almost a year, I can say I've fallen in love all over again.<br />The shots are amazing. The quality is superb. Once you know how to use it properly, you'll be amazed what she can do. For anyone who has been searching for a replacement for their standard camera (and willing to put a little effort into the learning curve), your search is over.","Excellent camera.  I have purchased three, one personal and two for work.  That is the best review I know to give.

I tried both.  at first, I bought P9, since it's so CUTE and compact... and easy to carry around... but, alas.. it was a big mistake.<br />P9 took good pictures, but as 4Mp camera, it wasn't good enough. and one severe draw back is that it does not take good picture when you use flashes; pictures come out blurry most of time. so, I returned P9 and got S85.<br />it's much much much better.  loved it.<br />it's heavier, but it's definitely worth it.<br />i love this camera, and if you are thinking of buying P9 over this one.. drop that thought.. unless, you want to waste your money.","I've had this camera for a couple of months now and have taken pictures under varying conditions and have found this camera to be an excellent one.  Just about all the good things people have to say about it here are true so I won't repeat them.<br />However, I do have one quibble with this camera -- the focus.  The focus is slow and under certain conditions doesn't work well at all.  There is a pseudo manual focus available but it doesn't always work well and can only be set at certain predetermined settings.  There was one photo we tried to take of Christmas dinner where we had the dinner table and plates in the foreground and all the family members in the background.  No matter what I did with the auto focus or the manual focus, the picture did not turn out.  The people were always fuzzy but the plates in the foreground were always crystal clear.  I'm not a professional photographer so maybe I was doing something wrong but I do have extensive experience with varying SLR and digital cameras over 10 years so I truly think it was a camera problem rather than a user problem.<br />Nonetheless, it's still a great camera 99% of the time and you can't beat the value.","I have always loved taking snapshots of my kids.  I've always used 35 mm film camera's and wasted so much money.  Now I just point and shoot, delete anything I don't like and most of the time don't even develop the pictures.  I just carry them around with me on my laptop and pull up a slide show when I want to show people the pictures.  I've had loads of fun.<br />I have also taken pictures to sell as a fund raiser for our church.  The church members are so pleased with the results, they have absolutely said that I take better pictures than going to a photography studio.  Of course, I went and purchased black velvet material for a background and also grey background paper from a camera shop.  The pictures really do look professional.<br />I've learned that printing at [another location] is much quicker, easier and maybe less expensive than printing on my home photo printer.  Everyone agrees that the quality is better.  Photo printer pictures smear with even accidentally spitting on the picture while talking.  (I've seen this happen a couple of times already).  Unlike [other] matte prints, I've even purposely spilt water on one and no damage to the picture.  COOL!<br />Cons:  Slow shutter speed.<br />  I have to turn on and off when connecting to computer by usb cable.<br />  Pictures look in focus on LCD screen when in reality they are blurry.  The only way to find out if they are blurry before printing is to view them on a computer monitor.  TV is not helpful.  The pictures are not clear like on a computer monitor.<br />I absolutely love my camera and would recommend it to anyone who is not a professional photographer.  I am not a professional photographer and am not sure what one would require in a camera.","We purchased this camera before Christmas just to see what a digital camera would be like.  It is such fun!  The pictures are as good as film camera ones and I have only used the automatic settings so far.  I like seeing my photos immediately and being able to print them at home.  It's great for a party to send guests home with pictures.  I have been able to \"save\" several lousy shots by correcting them after the fact on the computer.  It's amazing what can be done with lighting, color, contrast, and focus--not to mention red eye.<br />What I haven't liked as well is that in the automatic mode you can not take pictures in quick sucession, so candids are trickier.  I also get a lot of red eye which I'm told would be eliminated with an external flash.  Overall it's a great camera, and I have enjoyed this little toy.","I first bought the DSC-S75 model and had problems with it so I upgraded to the DSC-S85. So far I am happy with it, but honestly do not think it is worth the expense. I am used to using professional camera gear, so I thought digital would be the next level and way to go. This is my 4th digital camera and works great for ebay or other online mediums & is convient. But truthfully you will get better quality images from traditional still cameras plus you have more control over favorable outcomes. As far as digital goes this is a great camera, since you can view & edit images on screen. But if you are looking for something to save and print I would recomend Cannon EOS Elan with 35-135mm more control better lense options etc, or a Contax 2.8/38 point & shoot it has a Carl Zeiss Lense and takes the best point & shoot photos I have ever had. So bascially it comes down to what is this camera for? Pictures of the kids, and events you want to save / cherish, or images that do not matter how they look and the permance? The choice it yours..","I needed to upgrade after 4 years with a Sony FD-85 Digital camera. I needed higher resolution and higher memory capabilities. This camera met those needs, plus has some other pretty good capabilities, like shutter priority, aperture priority, good battery life, well thought out layout for all the controls, fairly simple menus, spot metering, and more. Also a pretty good price for everything you get, particularly 4 megapixels.<br />What makes me wish I had bought a different camera is the focus system.<br />Auto focus is really hard to see, and obtain for other than distance shots. Anything within 3 feet, the auto focus fluctuates and takes enough time focusing that by the time you think it's in focus and take the shot, it has sometimes refocused out of focus. It's timing and a guessing game. A larger LCD screen would make the focus more visible and help. The manual focus is in increments by scrolling, rather than manually focusing the lens.<br />In macro mode manual focus does not work, which is exactly when it is needed the most. Moving the camera to the correct distance for focus in macro mode doesn't work well. Better to pick a distance, let the camera auto focus, then try to move closer and again wait for it to focus.<br />\"Macro\" does not mean \"Micro\", but close-up it isn't.<br />The FD-85 4 year old technology far surpasses this camera on auto and manual focus. Focus function, speed, and accuracy. With a Sony close-up adaptor accessory lens, the old camera was far superior at close-up work. Such an attachment with this camera would be of help (not available), but I question as to it's value due to the focusing problems.<br />For great pictures on vacation, to replace a 35mm instamatic, and/or to have control over the camera's shutter and aperture when needed, this is a very good camera. 4 megapixels is absolutely great.<br />For anyone who shoots pictures closer than 3 feet and wants a camera that can do real Macro, I can't recommend this one. If focus was more reliable, quicker, truly manual, and manual in Macro mode, I'd recommend it. For me, I'm pretty close to selling it.<br />Lastly, Sony typically equips it's products with the bare minimum in batteries, memory, and other replaceable items. They did much better with the battery on this one, it's not necessary to have to buy one to get it to last more than 30 minutes. The memory is not rock bottom, but for a 4 megapixel camera, plan on buying a better memory stick. 128mb works well.","I love this camera.  I shopped around for about 2 months for a camera.  I was a bit hesitant because to get the goods you have to spend the goods. But WOW!!!  I couldn't be happier.  This camera has everything.  The thing I use the most is the e-mail feature.  You take all your pictures and the camera stores 2 copies.  One in the size you choose and one in an email size.  This was great at Christmas.  We took 95 pictures and it took 9 minutes to email them all.  So now my family can pick the ones they want and I can get them printed and it didn't take 6 hours for them to download their email.  I haven't had time to figure all the features out, but I will.  This camera is so easy to use, you can start as soon as the battery is fully charged.  By the way Spend the money and get the 128mb memory stick ITS SO WORTH IT!!!","this camera does it all...video with sound, pics in different resolutions,  sfx-b/w. sepia, negative....<br />get the biggest memstick you can afford. w/ the 128meg you got 22 min of video or 1000 or so pics on the lowest setting. great for railfans.","I must say that I was quite skeptical about digital photography when I received this camera as a wedding gift; I had read all the articles pointing out that film cameras produce higher quality photos, etc.  I was also quite certain that Sony could not possibly produce top quality lenses.<br />I was wrong on both counts.  This is an excellent value for an entry level digital camera.  It takes excellent pictures in ideal lighting, and the convenience of digital imaging is such that you will never go back to standard film.  While the 16MB memory stick that comes with the camera is a joke, and you'll have to shell out for a 128MB or 64MB almost immediately if you want to enjoy the camera, all of the other accessories turned out better than I expected.  The battery life, for example, is excellent (and this is VERY important for digital cameras); I rarely have to even think about turning off my LCD since I can get about 2 hours life out of it.<br />A few gripes:  The camera has a very hard time dealing with bad lighting - it generally darkens everything, often to the point that everything is unviewable.  As a result of this, the camera generally does not show its strengths indoors - it takes outstanding outdoor, daylight pictures, but struggles mightily whenever the lighting is a bit challenging.  Also, the camera's auto-focus can leave something to be desired; it often takes poorly focussed shots if there are both foreground and background items on which to focus.<br />That said, this is one of the best gifts I've ever received.  I use the camera constantly (much more than I used my old film camera), and I'm generally very happy with the quality of my pictures.  You can't go wrong with this camera.","I've never owned a digital camera, nor am I anything but an extremely amateur photographer, but our first grandchild was coming, so I began doing a lot of research in consumer's magazines and at technical review websites. I narrowed the choice down to three cameras: The Sony S85, the Olympus C4000, and the Nikon CoolPix 4300, all of them 4 megapixels. After playing around with all three models, I finally went with the Sony S85 -- and I have not been disappointed. It's both simple enough for a camera novice like me to be able to take good pictures almost right out of the box, yet flexible enough (with the full manual control option, etc) to allow me to learn and to work up to a more advanced level. The controls are pretty intuitive -- for anyone with computer experience, anyway -- and the viewscreen is large and bright. It's also \"camera-shaped,\" not a radical new design, which feels more at home when I hold it, and it's large enough to allow my rather large hands to wrap around it. (The Canon Elph is a nice little camera, but for me it's like trying to type on a cell phone keypad.) After six months and some hundred of images, I can recommend this camera unreservedly.","I looked around to pick a good digital camera. I had a few things in mind that I wanted but I could never find a right all together piece. I think that Sony was the best compromise in terms of features, size and durability. I shoot a lot of film and a lot of times I really don't have to, since the pictures don't go further than web. Using S85 saved me on processing cost, time and gave me more options as far as manipulation of the images go. Since my original purchase was to ease the load and free me up in my \"professional\" life I find that more often I happen to pack the digital on my hiking or camping trips. I still carry my film camera but I supplement my film shots with a lot of digital snaps. Using Sony manual modes also allows me to become better photographer and it's really fool proof. I see the results immediately and if something is wrong I can re-shoot it again which was impossible with film. I mean yes I can always shoot two or three frames but you surly never know until you get the film from the lab what came out. When I shoot concerts or band shots this is a one time deal. They can't go back and replay the gig. So to be perfect and on the dime is very important for me. I choose S85 for couple of reasons:<br />1) Optics. Can't go wrong with Carl Zeiss glass. It's a really sharp and warm saturated tone that keeps me buying into Zeiss family.<br />2) Lens brightness (f/stops). Maybe there are better cameras out there with higher zoom range but f/stops on this camera (S85) rock. It's bright and fast enough which means that in combination with faster film setting it will get the job done.<br />3) Battery life. I originally was very skeptic of using rechargeable battery because of the possible what if I run out of juice scenario. I assumed that I will feel more secure with AAs that rechargeable proprietary battery. I was wrong. Sony battery lasts forever and with one spare everything is pretty much covered.<br />4) Quality. Good enough for nice and crisp 8 by 10 shots. If I really push it I can get 11 by 14. But for my application it gets the job done.<br />5) Controls. Easily accessible, options are always at the finger tips.<br />6) Construction. It's a one big solid unit. No swivel lens, sliding doors, build in lens covers or pop up flashes. There is very few moving parts which makes it a durable piece. Plus build in charger keeps all your things organized.<br />7) Flash and Sharpness control. At the finger tips I have full override on functions that were always problematic with digital cameras. This saves post production time required for touch ups.<br />What could have Sony done to make it better?<br />1) ISO. Highest ISO setting is 400  I wish they went for 800.<br />2) Accessories. There is a load of after market accessories for this camera by other manufactures than Sony. I would like to see some more lenses or maybe even external battery packs made by Sony itself. Underwater housing would be great.<br />3) Little bit slow start up time. That needs some works.<br />4) Memory stick. Great concept and I couldn't care less if I'm using memory sticks, flash cards or smart media cards but with 128 MB max Sony media is not the hottest choice out there.<br />Sony S85 is a good camera, probably the best out of the bunch out there. I would highly recommend it to amateurs and semi pros alike. It's a good value for the money.","After a lot of research, I bought the DSC-S85 Digital Camera. I am a Police Officer and I needed a digital camera for crime scenes, auto accidents and, of course, family photos. The Sony DSC-S85 does it all.  The DSC-S85 does require you to have some basic understanding of photography and computers but it is also user friendly to someone who wants to learn, and learning with this camera is fun. You won't go wrong buying this camera.","Excellent Camera! In Auto mode it takes good pictures. For Pros it has cool features like White balance, Spot metering, Shutter and Aperture priority modes. The 1.8 inch screen LCD screen is bright and sharp. Supplied bettery lasts for 3 hours. Only extra thing you need to buy is 128MB memory..The USB driver shows camera as an extra removable drive in Windows Explorer which is very convenient. It is very compact too.","I have had this camera about six mounths now.Takes terrific pictures.Has very good color reproduction.After hearing that digital pictures were not as good as 35mm film i waited.Then i decided to buy it and find out.Great pictures so goodby film developing.Takes better pictures then i thought possible.I think that rumor was started at the photo labs.Or with the 1mp owners thinking they had a photo camera.<br />Has a long battery life and simply recharge the battery over and over again no buying AA batteries.Sony did it again came up with a great product.","I shopped around and looked at a lot of cameras before I decided on this one. I wanted a camera that could take pictures like a 35mm, yet have ease and use of a digital. This one fits the bill. On highest setting it records pictures at about 2mb. That means that if you buy a 64mb memory stick you get 32 pictures.(You can get lots more if you go to a lower megapixal setting, but why buy a high megapixal camera if you aren't going to use it to the max?) I have yet to go that far (I have transfered them to the computer and then started over). The battery last about 180 minutes using it with the LCD (which I recommend shutting off if you don't need it-especially outside). The only drawback at the present is that most photo printers cannot print at the capacity that my camera can take. I did have my pictures developed professionally online and was very pleased. The other drawback-and this is true for almost all digital cameras at this time, is that action photos are very difficult to capture due to low shutter speed. (not impossible, just very hard). This camera allows for adjustments of the aperature so you can take lower light pictures. I am very happy with the camera,and I recommend it for anyone who really wants to use this for taking vacation photos and such. Deleting and in camera cropping is easy and comes out great. You'll find yourself taking over a hundred pictures in just the first week!","I've been a serious amateur and semi-pro photog for years, always used an SLR and never wanted to even use a digital until the technology was high quality.  I was up and using this one in minutes, and exploring its possibilities within just a few hours.  Best small camera I've ever owned.","I've been a semi-pro or \"advanced amateur\" photographer for years, always using a 35mm SLR and yet greatly appreciating smaller cameras for their convenience and portability.  I held off buying a digital camera until the technology seemed smooth and capable of high quality work.  I love the Sony DSC-S85, it is highly versatile, capable of sophisticated photography and yet, if you know a little about photography, you'll be up and running in only a few minutes.  In fact, even if you've only used a point and shoot camera, you can love this one right out of the box.  Read the reviews, compare, study the features, but when all is said and done, this should be the one you choose.","I recently purchased the DSC-S85, and I absolutely love it!!  I use this camera all the time, and love the flexibility of it.  I can use it as a point and shoot camera, or manually adjust the settings.  I have even taken up some minor amateur photography with this camera.  I find it easy to use, and great at taking wonderful pictures.  Also, while many have complained about the memory sticks, I bought a 128 mb for [$].  I have taken over 100 pictures at one time in JPEG format, and had enough room to take several minutes of video with it.  I would highly recommend this camera to anybody.","I come from a family of photographers and have been a serious photographer for 40 years.  Over that time, I have owned just about every camera type and brand there is (Leica, Nikon, Rollei, Contax, etc...) and I have honestly not used a camera that is as sweet and accurate as this (only possible exception the Contax G2-a beautifully designed camera).  I have used the meter almost dead into the sun and gotten shadow detail in center average mode.  The lens is phenomenal and the controls are not only exactly what you would want (as a photographer) but are where you want them.  Thank you Sony for making my transition into digital so exciting!!","I have a long history of darkroom photography and over the years have owned and/or used practically every brand of camera.  I recently went digital because the huge number of pixels available made the picture quality close to 35mm film quality.  I did a lot of research and ended up with the S85 and am I ever happy.  This camera has an excellent metering system, I have gotten perfectly exposed shots shooting almost into the sun, with shadow detail.  The Zeiss lens (one of the reasons I opted for this) is crisp and the camera handles as well as any I've ever used, including my favorite (for its design), the Contax G2.<br />  And, as a photographer, I still can't get over the idea that I can actually see the effect of over or under exposing BEFORE I take the shot!  This digital is designed for photographers, make no mistake about it.","I had been using a DSC-S70 for close to two years.  Sadly, that wonderful camera was stolen just a couple of weeks before Christmas.  It nearly broke my heart!<br />There was no doubt in my mind I wanted another Sony.  I am not a professional photographer, not even what you'd consider a \"buff,\" just a mom of 4 kids who likes to take lots of pictures!<br />The pictures I took with the S70 were so AMAZING!  I would show my photo albums to others and the first thing they'd ask was \"what kind of camera do you use?\"  I have all my pictures developed by OFOTO and have found their services to be great!<br />I've had the S85 for a very short time now, but so far, it appears that the picture quality surpasses even that of the S70.  And, the S85 has some improvements in controls, etc.<br />Overall, I'd say the S85 is one of, if not THE, best digital camera on the market.<br />Many others have written to give technical reviews of the camera's features, just wanted to add that I think Sony's digital cameras are so good, that I purchased a second one!","Amateur digital cameras make me long for the speed and accuracy of my Nikon N-90S professional SLR.  But an equivalent digital will set you back $5000 plus lenses, and increases the focal length of your lenses by 50% (and I love wide angle).<br />The DSC-S85, which a friend of mine owns, retains the lens of DSC-70, which I own, increases the pixel resolution, and lays out the controls a bit more naturally.  Still, don't expect to hand this to your non-photographically-oriented friend and expect them to be able to control it -- the menus, etc. are just awful and very slow to navigate.<br />The real win for me for this camera is the Zeiss lens, which while not up to their professional lenses, is far better than what you get on other digitals.  This lens goes fairly wide (34mm equivalent for 35mm film), and has an excellent macro resolution.  It's also super fast at f2.0 at the widest to f2.8 at the longest;  phenomenal specs for a lens that costs $800, much less a whole camera.  A serious problem is that there's no way to get accurate focus -- the LCD just isn't sharp enough to selectively focus on just the foreground of food photos, for instance, even though at full telephoto on f2.8, you get a nice shallow depth of field.<br />At higher resolutions, the camera can only be described as slow both in time between the shutter press and the snap (it locks focus, so pre-locking by pushing shutter halfway will help), and between photos (especially at high res, it can take seconds to write the image from the camera's buffer to the memory stick).  It's also relatively slow to auto-focus.<br />The flash is weak, and so close to the lens that if anyone's looking at the camera, it's instant redeye.  On the other hand, the lens and CCD are so sensitive, you can nearly take photos in the dark anyway.  I do like the fact that you can fill flash, but wish you could turn down the fill level.  For anything but the most casual flash photography, you can hook up an external flash.<br />MPEG films are cute, but short and poor quality (or longer, and even poorer quality).  If you want to shoot longer mpegs, you'll have to hook up the video out to a notebook and get the relevant software.  I wish they'd just get rid of this feature along with the sound and sound memo recording, and give me a slightly wider lens and more control over focusing (say zooming the display during viewing).<br />And you'll need a new memory stick or two (get the 128Mb ones, you won't regret it if you like to take photos).","I have been shopping for a digital camera for about six months now, and I have been unable to make up my mind. I didn't want to spend a ton of money, so I was looking at several lower end 2.1 megapixel cameras. Well, I suppose my wife grew weary of my indecision, so she purchased the Sony DSC-S85 for me for Christmas. I was pleasantly surprised by the gift, and even more surprised by the quality of the camera. I have been a camera buff for several years, and have been wanting to dabble in digital photography. I can't imagine a better camera for under $1,000.00. Granted I have only had it for a week, and I am just beginning to discover the incredible potential of this camera, but the options seem almost limitless. It is amazingly easy to use, and offers a host of choices to make your experience as challenging as you would like. The 3x optical zoom is quite adequate, but it is enhanced by the digital zoom which still provides a high quality image.<br />Here are the pros and cons as I have seen them:<br />Pros:<br />Easy to use<br />Packed with features & all functions are easily accessed<br />4.1 megapixels provide incredibly sharp images at highest resolution<br />Small & sturdy construction<br />Long Battery life w/ fairly quick recharge (battery meter is very accurate)<br />Bright LCD screen<br />MPEG movie option (memory hog)<br />Great value at just $800.00<br />Cons:<br />16mb Memory Stick is not enough to hold many high res images & additional Memory Sticks are expensive.<br />Images in LCD screen often appear in focus, but really aren't<br />Bright reds tend to cause a pink hue throughout image (but that could happen to a 35mm SLR)<br />Slight delay when taking pictures, but canbe overcome with some practice.<br />All things considered, I am very, very happy with this camera. As with any product it has it's negatives, but they are far outweighed by the positives. In addition to the camera, my wife also purchased the Memory Stick reader, that can remain attached to the PC via a USB port and functions like a zip drive. This is very helpful when it comes to downloading images, because you don't waste the camera battery life. She also purchased a 128mb Memory Stick. Yes, this is a very expensive accessory ($100 +), but it has been worth it. At it's highest resolution image it will hold 60 images, but if you are taking pictures to e-mail at 640 x 480 it will hold nearly 10 times as many. I also like the fact the Memory Stick can be used over and over again. If you are looking to take pictures and turn them into prints, then this a great camera. The color saturation is tremendous, and the image quality is outstanding. If all you wish to do is e-mail photos and post them to the web then you could get by with a much cheaper model. Even after only a week, I have no problem giving this camera my highest recommendation.","After trying the Nikon Coolpix 995 for about a week, I recently returned it because of software and hardware defects of the camera. I was anxious about buying another digital camera but purchased Sony Cybershot DSC S85. I am very happy with the decision. The images are sharper than Nikon Coolpix 995. It is relatively easy to learn the features and load the software on your computer compared to Nikon. The LCD screen is also lot better than Nikon and easier to work with with menu and set up screens. The only disadvantage is that you must buy somewhat more expensive Sony products but the quality makes up for the added costs.","The features I like best about this camera are its small size and compact shape, ease of using the controls, and the excellent pictures I get with it. I purchased a 128MB memory stick which I generally use so I have never have to stop shooting because of running out of room. I like being able to print 7 x 10 photos of high quality. I use this camera with a laptop, so I download the pictures into my computer using a PC Card Adapter, but the USB connection works well too. Great camera.","i searched around for weeks before finally deciding on the sony dsc-s85 as my 21st birthday present and first digital camera.  i've had the camera for a little under four months now, and i am almost up to photo number 2,000.  needless to say, i couldn't be happier with it.<br />the battery life is great, and since sony includes both a rechargeable battery *and* an adapter, there is never a problem.  the 16 mb memory stick is wonderful to start out with, and i think if anything at all, the only problem is the expense of the sony memory sticks over regular memory cards.  but lexar just came out with their own memory sticks, which i've seen for $20-30 cheaper than sony's.  woo!<br />i had a photography class this semester at college, and i decided to try to use my digital for some of the photos, to see how they would come out when printed [i just burn them to cd and drop them at wal-mart!]--with my 4 megapixel sony, i ended up with some of the best photos i've ever taken, with really high quality both on screen and on paper.  this is true for both color and black and white shots, too.  in both cases, you cannot tell that the photos are digital.  they look amazing.  i took a lot of photos in black and white with no flash, during theatre performances and such at my school, and those were just great.<br />this cam lets you really play with existing light and shadow, and lets you know right away if a shot just isn't working.  i love the instant gratification aspect of digital--i've taken many a shot that i thought would be wonderful and just...well, wasn't.  but it's okay, because i just deleted those shots and knew for next time, instead of having to pay to get them developed and being disappointed.<br />the camera is everything from fully automatic to fully manual, which is so cool.  i'm still learning all of the manual functions, and i'm really glad to have that kind of option.  as i get better at the technical stuff, i can use it to enhance the artistic stuff.<br />one small thing:  the motion picture option is fun and looks cool on the display, but doesn't look that great on the computer.  but, as someone else said, this camera isn't made for that sort of thing anyways.  so it's not such a big deal.<br />apart from the really high-end $1000+ digital slr cameras and stuff like that, i think the sony dsc-s85 is the best of its kind right now.  tons of cool features, great battery life, easy to use, and usb transfer is simple and fast.<br />really, i can't say enough.  it rocks.","i searched around for weeks before finally

knew for next time, instead of having to pay to get them developed and being disappointed.<br />the camera is everything from fully automatic to fully manual, which is so cool.  i'm still learning all of the manual functions, and i'm really glad to have that kind of option.  as i get better at the technical stuff, i can use it to enhance the artistic stuff.<br />one small thing:  the motion picture option is fun and looks cool on the display, but doesn't look that great on the computer.  but, as someone else said, this camera isn't made for that sort of thing anyways.  so it's not such a big deal.<br />apart from the really high-end $1000+ digital slr cameras and stuff like that, i think the sony dsc-s85 is the best of its kind right now.  tons of cool features, great battery life, easy to use, and usb transfer is simple and fast.<br />really, i can't say enough.  it rocks.","As a fine art photographer form almost 20 years, I was somewhat skeptical about digital cameras as being much more than tech toys. When I finally decided to get a digital camera, I poured over the detailed, technical reviews to gather as much info as I could on competing models. In comparison with other cameras, what sold me on the S85 was the image quality, color fidelity, and ease of use. Now that I've used the camera a lot, I could not be more pleased. For occasional 35mm work, I [previously] used a top \"Pro\" class camera and lenses, which will probably now be relegated to the closet for the most part. And believe me, I understand metering and focus, but I could not hit exposures and focus dead-on nearly as quickly or often as the S85.<br />Pros: Nice, well balanced feel, unbelievably sharp lens, rich, accurate color without being \"clipped\" at the top end, excellent metering under diverse lighting conditions, snappy, accurate autofocus, and user friendly menus.<br />Cons: None so far. Suggestion: Buy more memory (64MB has worked for me).<br />Sony gets 6 stars but Amazon allows me to give only 5. Simply an awesome little camera.","I have been looking for an easy to use digital camera that would produce pictures with quality equivalent to those you can get from a 35mm camera like my old Nikon N4004 SLR. The DSC-S85 does it. I have taken pictures and sent them to PhotoAccess to get 8X10 enlargements and the result was amazing. No graininess, perfect clarity, supurb pictures. I get the advantages of digital: instant feedback on whether the picture came out as expected; deleting pics on the fly that don't work; adjusting light and color balance; cropping and editing before printing; AND the advantages of 35mm: high detail, good enlargements, and lots of control options. I am now sold on digital.","I am a serious film photographer (50 years experience) using Canon products for the last 25 years. I thought I would take the plunge with digital for the numerous times I wished I had quick results. I felt this camera had a better mix of features and a Zeiss lens at a lower price than the similar Canon. I am delighted with the camera and its veratility. It is easy to use. It's interface with Windows ME and XP worked flawlessly. Of course it does not offer SLR composition nor the options of interchangable lenses, ... it more than sufices for the moment. When and if the SLR version becomes more resonable I will switch. An excellent camera at a reasonable price.","This is our second Sony Camera, the first a Mavica FD-95 and now the DSC-S85. What a wonderful piece of equipment. Does everything it is meant to do and more. We love it and it is easy to use, providing some wonderful pictures.","I've had this camera since the summer and I love it -- the colors are vibrant and crisp.  Plus, the camera is a manageable size.<br />To stop the LCD screen on the back from getting scratched, I put a PDA screen-saver on the LCD (find at fellowes.com) -- you have to trim it a bit, but when it's on, you can't even tell (the display is still crisp), and no more worries about scratching the display.<br />Enjoy!<br />Eric","I have been a 35mm film amateur photographer for many years. I have always used Nikon equipment and I value to control the camera myself for maximal creativity. I waited till now to try a digital camera, what I did two weeks ago buying the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-S85 camera. These are my impressions when I compare it with classical 35 mm film and my reflex Nikon camera:<br />1.- The DSC-S85 is small, but not small enough to fit easily in a pocket. Nevertheless is easy to carry and the retractable lenses make it quite compact when the power is off. The camera comes with a lens cover for protection. It is a high quiality point a shot with manual settings capabilities.<br />2.- One of my concerns about digital photography is battery life. With the DSC-S85 this is not a problem at all. The battery will last a long time and unless you don’t have the chance to recharge the battery during several days, it will not run out of power. The battery recharges quite fast when connected to electrical power.<br />3.- The lenses and Carls Zeiss, and the quality shows. Impressive resolution across the whole picture, not only when you view the pictures in the computer screen but also in print.  I have done up to 5x7 inches prints and the quality is as good as film. Resolution is as good as the one obtained with my Nikon lenses.<br />4.- It very easy to learn how to use the camera and very easy to control manually the shutter and aperture. In addition you have also aperture and shutter priority settings and full automatic setting. The easiest camera I have ever had.<br />5.- The light meter is very good, and most of the exposures will come perfect unless you try to fool the camera with difficult light situations. The exposures are better than when I use my Nikon SLR.<br />6.-Color balance is very good, saturated images but with real colors. Only very strong reds (i.e. a red rose) might fool a bit the camera and you might need to correct the image with software. Film here might be better and you can uses several film typoes, but one advantage of digital is that you have ISO 100-400 with no need to change the film.<br />7.-The LCD screen is very good, bright (you can regulate the brightness, and provides a quite realistic view of the actual image. I use the LCD a lot, and really is a great way to compose pictures, better than using the view finder.<br />8.-You can do MPG movies that are fine if all you want is to have a memory of a short moment (don’t expect top quality here, after all this is an still camera). You can not do this with a film camera.<br />9.- Although the Memory Sticks are not the cheapest memory in town they are reasonable after the recent price drop. With 128 MB you will be able to take >60 pictures at the top resolution. Film is not cheaper because you can reuse the Memory Stick for ever.<br />10.- Very good macro. Nice pictures taken at short distances (<4 inches). My macro fotos with the SLR Nikon are better though.<br />If you are a film photographer that wish to get very good quality in digital to have the opportunity of doing creative photos without caring about the price of film, I highly recommend this camera. You will enjoy it very much you will make more photos that before (without paying always for the film) and when the digital SLR cameras drop in price (2-3 years from now) you will be ready to move to a classical camera with digital power.","Hi<br /> I recently bought this camera for my design projects. And its Great. When pictures are taken at high quality it goes to the computer at 32in X 24in @ 72 dpi pic. but when resized to it can print on 17in X 11in @ 300 dpi with little or no pixelation, at 8inX6in its quality is only limited by your printer. The Power of the camera to take pictures at night is exceptional too, i took a picture at 12 midnight of a bridge 3 or 4 miles away and it came out very clear. clear enough for me to see the support beams and a defined outline of the horizon of buildings behind it. The camera is also good for close up shots as well. I recently started takign pictures of my friends at 1-3ft away and its clear. When zoomed you can see pores, small face hairs, and skin flakes. it also records mini movies(limited by your mem-stick space)with sound. in general its really powerful and well worth the money. the only bad things is it takes 3-5 secs for each shot, lcd can get scratch up easily, flimsy plastic protector for usb port, and doesnt come with a case to carry it.<br />but well worth it =). God bless.","I bought this camera to take pics of my baby that is on the way. I tested it at theme parks during the summer, inside the house, at the baby shower and bbq's. Most of my shots came out perfectly. The red eye reduction is almost perfect and flash is appropriate. One problem is it takes a few seconds between shots and I sometimes got shots where my subject was out of focus when other objects were at different depths in the shot as well. Pictures are clear and print great even at 8x10. Features are intuitive and useful. I like the fact that sound is recorded during mpeg recording however the quality of the video is fair. Battery life is adequate and thank you Sony for including a rechargeable Lithium battery AND an adapter in the box. I do wish the lcd screen was protected as I have unfortunately scratched it numerous times even though I bought a case for it. I am not a camera expert but the pics I have taken with this camera make me look like one and with one week left for my baby's expected birth, I feel I am more than prepared to have pictures ready to email and print for my family and friends. Great camera.","I've owned this camera for a couple of weeks now and I must say I am quite pleased with my purchase. You really can't beat the features/price of this camera. I'm a complete novice and I'm finding this camera very easy to learn to use and take clean pictures.<br />When I first was trying to decide which model to buy, I was a bit apprehensive concerning Sony's use of proprietary Memory Sticks. Well, I'm happy to say that not only has Lexar began selling their own branded type of Memory Sticks but, SanDisk has just signed a deal to resell Memory Sticks also. That should not only drive the costs down but, it will make it simpler to find them in stock.<br />I should also mention that the battery life is pretty good on this model and I find the fact that the battery tells you how much life it has left before needing a recharge quite usefull. All in all, I love this camera and am very happy to have jumped into Digital Photography with this model.","Honestly - I am NOT a photo Xpert, just a fan that makes dozns of snaps each holiday since I think many of the views I see R c00l. AND - which is VEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRY important - when shootin I wanto have the BEST Qlity, since all eVRY shot matters, when made.<br /><br />The real efficacy of the shots? - 'bout 10% or may-B less, honestly.<br /><br />DSC-S85, with 128MB MemStick, and with MSAC-US1 (USB-reader) aR my solution: I can shoot as a devil, havin options delete anytime a snap I dont like. When the card is full, I still can go over with friends and select on the DspLY the shoots worth keepin, and after the selection I can use my 128MB MemStick - or instert another MemStick and GO. Anytime the phots are displayed from a PWRPoint presentation or re-fabricated as old-fashioned paper-photos - they R just PRRRRRRRRRRRRRRFCT!<br /><br />Love this CyberShot DSC-S85, think it is my FAV for nxt yrs.<br /><br />It's a P.S. Dec-13, 2005: DSC-S85 is still my one and only camera. I've broken it in the woods some 3 years ago, while falling from the rocks, anyhow since I'm greedy I've not got it repaired, and it stil works. The only thing I can say: it's still no NEW generation of photocameras, that would make me think switching. In spite of a fact that thousands of cameras have debouched, S85 still is sufficient. And my recomm is: \"don't ask for the best on the market, ask for what you need; everytime somebody comes up with a new offer, ask youself: do I need it?\" If you would have seen me falling from the rock with my S85, you wouldn't believe it's in it's best nowadays :-)","I just received this camera a few days ago.  Being new to Digital Photography, I have a few things to figure out yet, but I love it already.  Feels great in the hand...very comfortable.  The quality of build is fantastic.  Images potrayed on the LCD are vivid and clear.  Menu's and operational features are clear, with a well documented manual.<br />Just a note that I did not buy it here....  AS well, sony just dropped prices by half on their memory sticks, so storage is cheaper as well.","After many weeks of research I selected this camara. was it a wise choice? You bet! This camara has all the features and then some. It has a powerfull macro ability. Able to capture pollen in the center of a flower. The manual is easy to read and I was snapping photos in just a few seconds. Downloading is quick & easy with no problems. If your in the market for a top of the line digital camara this one will fit the bill.","I just bought one.  Considered the G1 canon, and the 995, both similar in price.  BUT THE SONY has 4 megapixels!  What more to say?  Image quality is excellent.  Ease of use - any dummy can use it.  And it seems durable.  It is comfortable in the hand.  TONS of modes - shutter, aperture, program, b/w, sepia, different resolutions, etc.<br />The onscreen help is great.  Tells you minutes of batt time, pictures, all camera settings, and even when the zoom is optical vs digital.<br />THE ONLY DOWNSIDE: uses Memory stick instead of CF.  MS is much more expensive.  Oh well...  I wish you could use a microdrive!<br />This camera is so superior to the G1 and nikon.  Sony's price is incredible.","I shall not waste time and jump straight to my observations:<br />Pros:<br />1. the still captures were great. at 4.1 MP, you could get slightly better high quality pics than its brother F505V. the contrast between the details were distinct and the colors were very rich.<br />2. average battery used timespan range from 2 to 2.5 hrs, which was good.........<br />3. quite lightweight compared to other competitive contenders<br />cons:<br />1. 6X zoom might not satisfy the pros............"]},{"name":"Pentax Optio 330","amazon_reviews":["I get compliments about my pictures all the time!

Came with 16mb CF card good for 14 pix at 2048x1536 (max res)Makes great pictures and easily downloaded to PC....","After extensive researching internet and comparing a varieties of cameras, including Cannon S110, S300, S40, G2, Nikon 885, Sony DSC-P5 and Olympus D40Z, I finally bought Pentax 330 this Christmas, mainly for (1) its pocket size-\"take it and go anywhere\" (2) >3M pixels (3) manual controls. I love its size and bring it with me everytime when going to park with my kid. But I must admit that I'm a bit disappointed (1)in-door focus has problem - every two out of ten among my christmas party pictures are out of focus (I had to download and upgrade the firmware from v1.05 to v1.10 later and seemed to get a little bit better); (2)picture is not as sharp as I expected for a 3Mpixel camera; (3)movie mode does not record SOUND, a silent movie only -- what a miss! (BTW, the quality of movie is no comparison to D8/MiniDV camcarder. The movie looks very poor on TV. It is not pentax specific problem, since its resolution is only 320x240 vs 550x475 for D8/DV. Don't expect to replace your camcorder with any digicam's movie)<br />The default sharpness setting seems to use cheap sharpening algorithm. It's better to set it to soft and unsharp mask filter later.","I have one of these super little digitals in my pocket - smaller than my wallet, it's truly convenient for scenic shots. Its 3 X optical zoom is almost adequate, and helped by its 2X digital zoom. I agree with virtually all the pro's listed by the very enthusiastic fellow reviewers, but find the con's frustrating. These are (imho):<br />1. Low light focussing fails very often - the camera has no illuminating mechanism for autofocus - and allows a picture to be taken even if it has failed to find focus. Often it seems to guess - and will focus on distance once, then close, then distance again.... showing its little green \"focus-OK\" LED none-the-less. The focus-free setting is a partial work-around.<br />2. There is some barrel distortion on the wide setting - which at the equivalent of 38mm lens on a 35 mm camera - should really not yet occur. It also gets somewhat fuzzy around the edges at this setting. Group pictures focus at the centre - but people at the edges are fuzzy. This could be a depth of field problem, as the camera has only two aperture settings. This may improve significantly in the future as CCD's reduce in size, or Pentax my need to redevelop this 7 element lens with an aspherical lense system.<br />3. The camera emphasizes white, but I'm trying different saturation settings now.<br />4. The camera is not usually sold with the remote control - and the one I bought - which officially is the required one for the camera - lacks the remote controlled zoom described in the handbook. Seems there's a difference between intention and implementation at Pentax in this regard.<br />5. The flash ranges about 2m/6ft - much too short for a group picture in a room - compound this with the faults 1 and 2, and even some 1.3 megapixel cameras do better (less detail hides some of the errors.).<br />6. The camera has ISO sensitivities of 100 and 200. Many competing cameras have 400 also, which may have helped the flash range.<br />7. The LCD is rather small - necessarily a compromise of size - but allows one to zoom after the picture is taken - so if you want to check the quality of a picture you have taken - this is OK.<br />8.I soon bought a second (special) lithium battery, and the short battery life (about 20 pics at maximal quality, full resolution with flash and lcd or 32Mb - half the memory I've installed) is no longer a problem.<br />Lastly, it would be useful if the camera could be used as a webcam or controlled from a computer.., but cannot, as yet.<br />Personally, I am a little disappointed at the compromises made by Pentax - I was expecting more when I bought this little device. Its key advantage is small size, its light weight, the zoom, and its friendly and understandable menus that allow one to actually use its tremendous versatility.<br />The firmware version in my camera is V1.01. I bought the camera in October 2001.<br />I suggest you try this out with a few of the competing small cameras (and the 430) in different conditions, they all make compromises and this may be the camera you want. Pentax will probably improve this camera rapidly - they are so close to having a true winner.","Was skeptical because of size.  I am an amatuer photographer, and have had two different dig cams plus dig camcorder that takes stills.  Was looking to buy Mavica fd95.  Basically talked into buying Pentax Optio 330 by a sales person, who said if I didnt like it I could play with it for two weeks and bring it back.  I am not taking it back!  The first photo I took looked like it didnt come out right.  BUT...we had also bought a photo printer, where you just stick the card in the printer, select the size you want to print, select the picture, and print.  WOW!!!  I could NOT believe my eyes!  I did NOTHING to this photo, except snap it. It was GORGEOUS!  The only thing I do not like is the size of the viewfinder and the size of the LCD, but I WILL get used to it.  Perfect for carrying in Purse or pocket!","I am a photographer that likes to use all of the manual aspects of a camera.. I play with depth of field, and slow shutter speeds, pushing and pulling film etc.<br />PROS:<br />This camera has been a real joy because it has the three things that I was looking for:<br />1) Must be tiny...to fit in a jacket pocket easily for roaming..<br />2) Must be able to go manual for long exposures (up to 15 seconds)<br />3) Must do well in low light.<br />It satisfies all of these criteria very well, and I have been generally very pleased with it. Experimental photos are a dream.<br />CONS: Batteries go pretty quickly, so you have to have a second to swap. Once you've solved that issue, its a joy all around.","I was looking for a good point and shooter. I'd spent a while looking around at what was available and ended up buying a 330 for my company in order to see if it was good enough for me. In the end I bought it's sibling the 430. It's basically the same camera except a 4M pixel ccd instead of 3.3M.<br />The menus and set up are all superbly easy to use. The display is sharp although there is as the review before me states some issues with macro focusing. The movies lack sound which would be nice. Battery life with flash and display is short but most digicams seem to suffer from this complaint and turning the display off helps a great deal.<br />If you want a point and shoot that provides a wide range of options and also manual control for everything but don't want to sacrifice picture quality then buy one of these. I'm very happy with mine.<br />Pentax might not have been first with a compact digi cam but they are top of the heap now.","The Pentax is my 3rd digital camera and it is the best in terms of size, features and image quality. I had a Canon Powershot A5 (.9 MPixel) and a Canon Powershot S10 (2.1 MPixels). Both were good cameras in their class but the Pentax Optio 330 has done a significant step forward. I was looking for a smaller Camera which I could take always with me and it should have 3 million pixels resolution and if possibel a 3x optical zoom lens. The Pentax fullfilled this wishlist and the 800 pictures which I have taken so far showed impressively a significantly improved image quality over my previous cameras beyond its obvious resolution advantage. Pro:<br />- Great color management, sharpness, large contrast - overall - very realistic images<br />- Large resolution 3 MPixels<br />- 3x optical Zoom 37-111 mm which produces very good and sharp images<br />- Rechargable Lithium battery which lasts through the day<br />- compact battery charger (100-240V)<br />- wealth of information about exposure data on the LCD display<br />- Compactflash Memory Type 1 - important when coming from Canon<br />- auto and manual exposure mode with shutter speed range 15 sec to 1/2000<br />- many more features<br />Con:<br />- LCD display quality does no match up to image quality - not important but annoying and reason for 4 instead of 5 stars! Not good enough to use for the manual focusing mode as it does not allow to judge correctly in focus or out of focus<br />- no additional 'low power' display with basic information on number of exposures flash mode or makro<br />- makro mode only in wide postion of zoom - a sacrifice to the small form factor<br />All in all a great small camera for every day use and well worth the money"]},{"name":"Toshiba PDR-M81","amazon_reviews":["I found this camera to take good pictures for a 4.2 MP, and I love the short videos it can record. It's user-friendly. Mine has worked well for about three years now. I am getting ready to get a new camera, however, and I've decided to go with a Canon. Canon has a much better reputation for good customer service, and that is important to me. With my Toshiba, I was just fortunate not to have anything break down.","It is a question that all digital camera enthusiasts ask themselves shortly after purchasing a digital camera, but it is one that is not easily answered as there are many factors that need to be taken into consideration.  This review will help to guide you to the best solution based off the characteristics and specifications of the Toshiba PDR-M81 4MP Digital Camera.  I feel I am qualified to provide this information as I was in the memory industry for 7 years but having left the industry a year ago, I can be completely unbiased on this subject.<br /><br />One of the biggest factors to consider is the megapixel rating of this Toshiba camera.  Considering this particular camera is generally considered to be a 4MP digital camera.  You can expect to store approximately 32 images on a 64MB card, 64 pictures on a 128MB flash card, 128 digital pictures on digital film of 256MB capacity, 256 pics on a 512MB picture card, 512 images on a 1GB media card, 1,024 photos on a 2GB flash card, and a monstrous 2,048 digital photos on a 4GB card.  These image/picture calculations assume that you are going to utilize the full potential of your camera but won't shoot in RAW mode.  In other words, the estimates are for shooting at the highest JPEG setting available for the Toshiba PDR-M81 4MP Digital Camera.  Understand that they are indeed estimates and can vary based off the actual scene or subject being shot and the amount of light, color variation, detail, etc. in the photo.  You can assume these numbers are accurate within 10%.<br /><br />However how many images a card can hold is not the only factor you should consider before buying this all important accessory.  You should also consider that you may want to use your Toshiba PDR-M81 4MP Digital Camera to take shots of sporting events, wildlife, or even your child's unique expressions.  These moments have a very small window of opportunity to get the shot you desire thus a flash card that has been rated by experts as being a faster card may be something to consider.  In my opinion, it is always best to find a review of a flash card as it performed in your specific digital camera.  Some cameras just work better with specific flash cards do to the software, firmware, buffer utilization, etc. between the camera and the flash card.  Finding an answer to this question is not usually an easy task.  There is, though, a superb website that not only offers flash card reviews but also has an extensive user forum that can answer this all important question for you.  You may want to take a look at dpreview dot com and then do a search for the Toshiba PDR-M81 4MP Digital Camera in the forums area, if that doesn't work just do a search on Toshiba and you should be able to find someone that can help you.  I am fairly certain you will have plenty of information to make an informed buying decision.  You may also want to look at their detailed review of this particular camera as well if you have not yet decide on whether to purchase it.<br /><br />Of course one of the next factors to consider is in regards to price.  Please, do not make the mistake that I have made of buying the absolute cheapest flash card.  Take a look at the factors I have mentioned here before you make a purchase.  Think of a flash card for your Toshiba camera as an extension to it.  Just as you wouldn't purchase the cheapest camera case for your camera (personally I own the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack but I like the extra room and the backpack style, which may not be your cup of tea) don't necessarily purchase the cheapest flash card either.  Keep in mind that you will use this card every single time you use your camera.  Like I said it is truly an extension of your digital camera.<br /><br />The final thing I will mention is in regards to service.  There are a number of flash card suppliers in the world today.  However all of the flash cards are actually built by a handful (3 - 5) of companies and even those companies only have a few options (2 - 4) regarding which components they are going to use in their particular design.  More or less, the actually hardware inside each flash card is going to be similar but the way in which they utilize that hardware and the level of support they will provide, given there is a problem, are more paramount.  Just imagine going 10 days without a flash card for your camera (which I did) because you are waiting for some company to repair your flash card, or worse yet having it fail and having no recourse.  There are a couple of manufacturers that do very well in regards to utilizing technology and providing customer service.  As of the time of this writing they are SanDisk, Lexar, and Viking.  However check the newsgroups and forums for the latest information as it can be very cyclical and unfortunately can take a turn for the worse overnight.<br /><br />No matter what flash card you decide to use with your digital camera make sure you take the time to take the pictures.  Time flies by fast and having thousands of images to thumb through 5 years from now to remind you of the time that has gone by will be the most powerful investment of all.  I have personally purchased a SimpleTech external hard drive to store my images on (another reason I like the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack as it gives me room to put in my hard drive).  The hard drive combined with the backpack allows me to take my photos with me when I go visit family and friends.  I use PhotoShop exclusively to do all my photo editing and batch processing (a great feature of PhotoShop) and of course make occasional backups to DVD-RW.<br /><br />Enjoy your Toshiba PDR-M81 4MP Digital Camera.  I hope this review has informed you how this camera can be best enhanced by a flash card and the best approach in finding one that meets your specific needs.","Excellent features, easy to use, the best quality photos ever seen.

The picture quality is amazing.  It's very easy to use and all the features in the camera are for the beginners/novices, but I guess if you're into professional features you wouldn't be spending under a grand.  As far as the other comments I read,  the USB connection has no flaws on my computer.  It's quick and easy to use on the two picture software I have.  The only flaws are the battery use and the 8 meg card that it comes with.  Upgrade to the 128 meg and take 2400 X 1600 pics up to 84 times.  Also, upgrade to NiMh rechargable batteries.","Overall, this is a nifty lil' 3 megapixel camera.<br />Pros:<br />Solid contruction.<br />Ample features<br />Excellent image quality<br />Ease of use<br />Good value for money<br />Cons:<br />Toshiba is not really a camera mfr.  Amazon sells better cameras made by camera-only mfrs.<br />Lacks more advanced features, such as appropriate ISO step boosts.<br />Internal flash can cause red-eye too often<br />Although this camera has a lot going for it, don't get it. Amazon features many more cameras in the 3+ megapixel range that are superior. In particular, for a similar price as this one, look at the Nikon Coolpix line of excellent digital cameras.","I owned the 3.3 megapixel camera for about 2 months before it started having \"disk error\" messages - so I returned it and upgraded to this one.  The ease of use and photo quality are fantastic, but the usb connection (not sure if it is the cable or the camera port) is hokey.  I have to hold the cable, quite forceably, in the camera usb port, for uploads onto my laptop.  Good picture quality, but there seem to be some quality control issues."]},{"name":"Olympus D-150Z (C-1Z)","amazon_reviews":["For a first camera, I wouldn't trade it for the world.

However, I found the picture quality markedly worse than the less expensive 360L. Images were not sharp. Also the delay between hitting the shutter and getting the shot was considerably longer than that of the 360L.

I purchased an inexpensive battery charger for this at the same time, and that has proven to be a great investment. Yes, it uses battery life but it is worth it!

I bought this initially for my 5-year old son to take pictures (so we wouldn't waste money on films), but it turns out the picture qualities are as good as my Nikon camera (at HQ level).  If you are looking for an entry level camera, this is the one.","...Read all the other reviews first.  I agree with the good points that everyone else lists.  Compact, stylish, easy-to-use, economical, low-power use, etc.<br />One more thing to note, though.  I don't know if all digital cameras are like this, but this camera is not truely aim-n-shoot.  The camera pauses at least a full second after you press the \"shoot\" button before the flash will fire and the lens captures your picture.<br />This is fine for still shots, but this seriously affects your ability to take action shots or surprise shots.  So far, I have about 50 shots of my friends covering their faces with coats or their hands because my camera didn't fire off in time.  Also, this pause sometimes will cause you to take a blurry shot because it is sometimes difficult to hold your hands completely steady during that time.<br />But I still recommend this camera, especially for still shots.","Es una máquina concebida para facilitar la toma de fotogradías;  amigable y de uso sencillo. Con una buena resolución para la mayoría de las ocasiones. Fácil de transportar aunque la correa de sujeción es algo debil. Se debe indicar en la tapa de las pilas, la correcta dirección en que deben ser colocadas.","Ok.  You could spend more and get more bells and whistles.  You could get more MEGAPIXELS.  But you won't find a better combination of features for the money.<br />Ask yourself, what is a camera?  First it is a lens - and you get a good one.  Fast aperture at 2.4 (lower is better) and good zoom (3X)combine to outclass others in this price range - by far.  Olympus lenses have always been among the best of the best.<br />Second?  How about design and quality manufacture of the body?  One word - Olympus.  This is my third Olympus camera and I have never complained about the design or quality.  This camera may be small and mostly (if not all) plastic, but it is smartly designed and fairly rugged.  I have always loved the clamshell lens cover design as a way to protect the lens.  My 35mm Olympus has it too.  Great feature.  All controls are easy to access and there aren't too many buttons to make it confusing.<br />Third?  Film - or in this case Mega Pixels.  I know that more is probably better, but this one has enough for the beginner to intermediate photographer....and certainly enough for the casual snapshot photographer.  Don't be fooled into thinking you need more to have good photos.  Who prints anything more than 5x7 anyhow..??  You're probably not Ansel Adams.<br />Fourth?  Flash - nothing flashy here, just a good snapshot type flash with a few options.  Good enough for most purposes.<br />Fifth? Value - recent price drop via [Amazon.com] and Circuit City makes this a no brainer.  Buy it.  Buy two.  Have fun.  Someday you can move up to a more feature laden camera.  With this...just point, shoot, and admire your great photos....and don't forget to share them with those you love.<br />Sixth?  Simplicity - you can point and shoot in minutes after opening the box.  Later you can upload to your PC with ease via USB connection - no software needed.<br />If you have waited to buy a digital camera, now is the time.  The price is right and the camera is a good one.<br />Olympus D150 is a great camera all around.","For my office, I have purchased (from Amazon.com) four of these cameras over the past few months.  I intend to purchase another 3 or 4 over the next six months.  We use them to illustrate our reports.  I also use the camera a lot for personal use. For use in business reports, web page photos, or for emailing photos of the kids to the Grandparents, this is a great camera.  Don't be fooled by all of the hype surrounding which camera to buy based on the amount of megapixels.  If you are looking for a camera that is simple to use and has good photo quality this little 1.3 megapixel camera is perfect.  In fact, if you just want to take photos for emailing or for a web page, set the camera at the \"SQ\" (Standard Quality - which is ambout .3 megapixel)to take the picture. This setting produces a very good picture file with a relatively small file size (about 80 kb).  This makes emailing with a dial-up modem much faster, and more practical. Just imagine trying to email a 3 or 4 megapixel photo file over a dial-up connection - the file would be so large, it would take hours to upload / download.  Transfering to your computer is simple with the wire included, but you must have a USB port on your computer.  We also purchased Floppy Drive (\"A\" drive) adaptors (Flashpath)to have an alternative means to transfer...Other brief comments, purchase a 32 Meg SmartMedia card for extra storage.  The 8 Meg that comes with it is okay, but these things are so [inexpensive], why not get the option to hold more photos.  Also, buy rechargable batteries, and a recharger.  You will save money in the short term.","I took pictures right out of the box after easily installing the SmartMedia card and batteries.  There are great options for the more experienced photographer too. It works more like a computer accessory than a camera after taking the pictures. I only have to save and print the photos that I want and delete the others.  What a great Christmas gift.  I love it and am excited about learning to use all the features.","After reading reviews for this camera, I decided it would be a good investment.  However, I was quite disappointed when I got the camera home and began taking pictures.  Perhaps my camera is just faulty, but none of the pictures came out with good color.  Other than that, the camera is good.  It is easy to use and doesn't take long to get started.  However, I am considering taking the camera back.","The Olympus D-150 is an excellent entry level digital camera. It has most of the major features that is needed to do general purpose photography, whether it's computer based (web/email) or print based (great pics upto 5x7), with the ease of use of \"point and shoot, auto everything\" technology found on most \"traditional\" 35mm cameras.  All features are easily accessible from the menu system and there are quick access buttons for flash and marco zoom modes. The D-150 is is one of the few digital cameras in it's price class that has optical zoom (3X) which is far better than digial zoom (the D-150 also has 2X digital zoom for upto 6X zoom).  The included 8MB Smartmedia chip is small and you need to get at least a 16MB chip to do any serious shooting(the memory chips are not that expensive).  The 1.5in LCD display is handy for precise framing of your subject.  Also, buy the Lithium batteries!!!  Do not buy the Duracel or Energizer or other alkalines unless you are desparate.  It's worth the $10 (19.99 for two packs) to buy the Lithium battery pack.  They last considerably longer than alkalines, especially when using the LCD display.  Unless you have Photoshop or MS Office's Photo Viewer or equivilant, the software on the CD is useless except for PC driver support since the pics are jpeg format.  If you're using a Mac (especially G4 w/OS 9.x and higher), you don't even need the CD for the drivers thanks to it's USB connectivity.  Make sure your USB ports are working properly and try not to connect the camera through a hub or keyboard on both platforms.  All in all it is a nice, \"fun\", little camera and takes great images for 1.3 megapixals.  The D-150 is highly portable (unlike the high end Sony Mavicas...) and is feature packed for $300.  Truly a \"Best Buy\".","The driver installation instructions that come with this camera are WRONG! I had to contact the support center to get a completely different way to install the driver so I could download the pictures to my computer.<br />This is my first digital camera, so I thought I was doing something wrong.  Now that the driver is installed properly, I am happy with the camera's performance. Other than this, that is all the information I can give.","I am no photography expert and this is my first digital camera.  I agonized over this purchase for several hours reading all the reviews I could find.  This seemed like a good all-round camera for the price.  I rather get the impression that in camera terms you get what you pay for.<br />I think that this camera represents very good value for money.  If you want to put pictures on the web or email them then this camera certainly does an excellent job.  The software that comes with the camera is not great, but then you just plug it in and you can access the images using Windows Explorer (the camera is recognized as a removable hard disk).<br />I would say that indoor pictures in low light taken with flash are not too bad, however I understand that the flash is weak on many digital cameras, and this one is no exception.  I bought a 32Mb memory card, which can store 35 really high quality or 99 medium quality pictures, which I think is more than enough.  That card cost ...and medium quality is 1280 x 960 in 24bit, which is more than enough for my purposes.<br />I have not tried to print the pictures out in any way, but I am a web designer and so really I only want pictures in computer form for web or email use.  All in all I am quite impressed.  There are a few minor shortcomings but generally if you want high quality digital pictures for a reasonable cost this would be a great buy.  If you want awesome printable pictures that beat a quality 35mm camera, you're going to have to spend a little more I think.","I wish to dispell a misunderstanding that may be caused by the review of the Brio D-100 by 'rheumor' below.  All Olympus Brio cameras currently available feature optical viewfinders, in addition to LCD monitors.  These optical viewfinders use a lens that is separate from the lens used to take the picture; thus, some parallax is unavoidable.  When doing close-ups or other critical work, the user should employ the [built-in] LCD monitor for image composition.","Olympus makes the best-selling 35mm P&S camera in the world--the Stylus Epic. Take that technology and engineering, substitute a digital chip for film, add zoom and you have the Brio 150. So small it will fit in your pocket with room left for your keys. Very fast response time--slide open the clam shell covering and start firing. Great optics, very easy to use. My only problem is that once she sees it, my wife will make it hers. I guess I'll have to buy another! If you want a digital camera for email, prints up to 8x10, and pure fun, this is the one to get.","This is the same camera as the D-100, but with a nice 3:1 optical zoom. That addresses the most glaring shortcoming of the D-100, but adds a very significant premium to the price (40%). In this price and performance range, I'd much prefer the Olympus (Stylus-based) D-460. I have appended my review of the D-100: ***************************************************************** This is my first Olympus digital, but it will not be my last. It is a very nice beginner's purchase, and would also make a very good backup for a more dedicated digital photographer. The size and weight make it a breeze to carry in a pocket, purse or glove compartment. It has good quality optics, a 1 megapixel resolution (that will allow pretty good 5\" x 7\" prints), good battery life (and can use readily available alkalines) and easy USB connectivity to your PC for transferring images. The included 8 meg card is adequate, though it seems to me this camera, which when attached to your PC is automatically recognized as another drive (a nice feature requiring no software installations), would have benefited from some on-board memory. Furthermore, I do not like cameras that require using the LCD panel to view & frame the image, much preferring a traditional through-the-lens viewfinder, which is absent on the Brio. However, its most glaring short-coming is the lack of an optical zoom (it has a digital zoom, but these are vastly inferior digital tricks that halve the resolution while doubling the size of the selected portion of the photographed image), but if that's not a problem for you, you'll be happy with the rather handsome Brio."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 775","amazon_reviews":["Received and operated as described.

I mean thats about 25% of the price of the camera.<br /><br />but besides that, it is great.And the only reason i put 4* and not 5* is because of the price of the battery so if u know you're a person that doesn't reguraly lose things (wel my little sister took it out) than u shouldn't have any problems","I bought the Coolpix 775 in 2001, and used it for over 8,000 photos. Minor issue are [1] latency between pushing the button and actually taking the picture [2] proprietary battery capacity [3] proprietary AC adapter.<br />A week ago, I dropped the camera from 4 feet high on a semi-hard [thin carpet on hardwood] floor. When I turned on the camera, the display showed 'sytem error'. I opened the case [2 silver screws on each LHS and RHS, 4 at the bottom -note that 2 screws holding the tripod plate are of different type- then gently pry open the front using my finger nail -a soft flat piece of plastic is OK-] to separate the two halves: the empty front part with only the switch left -and a small ribbob connector- and thye body with everything else. I then removed the lens assembly [4 black screws, the cylindrical gear on the upper RHS close to the viewer has to be slightly lifted out of the way] and noticed that the 2 identations in the base plate had 'jumped out' of the 2 grooves in the lens barrel assembly. After putting the identations back in place, the lens now goes in and out. Zoom does not activate yet - relative positions of gears ? will work on it-. The motor assembly can be disconnected [1 black screw] from the barrel assembly and tested separately. Important Notes [1] I am not responsible for anything that could go wrong: you open the case at your own risk. Safe move is to send the camera back to the dealer [2] opening a camera is not for the faint at heart: use magnifying glasses, good lighting, watch screwdrivers and a compartment box for different screws -I use an ice cube tray with 14 compartments-. Hope this help 'resurect your camera' :)","I bought this camera around Christmas 2001 and thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Over the years, the camera has served me well. I originally bought a 64 mb card to go with it, and it was more than I ever needed, since I was pretty good about transferring the pictures onto my computer and clearing the card. The bundled software is pretty good. Allows you to drag the pictures and then drop them into any folder you like. Unfortunatly, my screen has recently broke. I made the mistake of packing it in my luggage that went through baggage handling. Even the toughest camera can't enure that abuse. It still takes pictures as well as it ever has, but I can't see how they turn out until I get home and hook it up. Isn't that the point of a digital camera? I think I may be in the market for a new one. I give it four stars because the screen broke, and costs way to much to fix.","This was our first digital camera...  purchased it in winter of 2001 I believe.  It was very easy to figure out and suits our needs perfectly.  Haven't had any problems with it.  If you're like us, and all you want is a camera that takes decent pictures and is easy to download onto the computer and email, etc., then this is a great camera.  I imagine we'll probably be ready for an upgrade soon, as I know Canon has made some improvements in the last couple years, but it's a great starter camera.","There are lots of entry level digicams these days. Frankly, most of them are so capable that aesthetics is as big a factor as most anything else, but in terms of sheer durability, the Nikon has proven itself better than many of its rivals.<br />It is quite compact and easily managed with one hand. Its 2.1 megapixel resolution is fine for most anything, including enlargements up to 8\" x 10\". The optics are superior, all glass and the effect is excellent clarity. The 3:1 optical zoom is fine, and a 2.5:1 digital zoom may add a bit of help (I'm not a fan of digital zooms, but they are able to enlarge the center of the image reasonably well, though they do so by halving the original resolution/quality). Like all these digicams, the 775 ships with too small a memory card, but this is easily rectified. The purchase of a separate card reader (eg. Viking, SanDisk) will also make life easier, as photo transfer to the PC and then to email or storage becomes very simple. The Nikon's rechargeable battery set-up is also a big plus.<br />If you're looking to get someone started in digital photography and do not want to buy a toy, this is an excellent selection.","I had a problem with burnt out pixels on this camera. Had to send it to Nikon twice to get it fixed. Took about a month going back and forth with Nikon. They need to work on their customer service a little.<br />The camera itself (once fixed) is quite good. Picture quality is decent. Very compact and light. The LCD is pretty sharp too. The white balance is good too and can be adjusted for different situations. Some chromatic aberration can be seen in the pictures. No manual settings or focus. But it does a pretty good job taking pictures in auto mode or in one of the preset scene modes. The flash is pretty good for such a small camera. Transferring pictures to the computer is a breeze over USB. The camera shows up as a drive on windows (98SE & XP) so you really don't need to use the Nikon View software for this. And since it shows up as another drive on the computer you can also use the camera as a portable hard drive :).<br />Includes rechargeable battery and charger and all the cables you need to get started. You may want to get a larger memory card though. In included 8MB card if you plan on taking a few pictures at the best quality setting (for good 4x6 prints). Overall this is a good bundle.","I love this camera!  It takes the BEST photos with excellent color rendering, clarity of photo, and it is very easy to use.  This camera takes better shots than most expensive 35mm cameras I have experienced!","I got the 775 camera in Nepal, where everything was running slow enough. As soon as i started working on the west side of the world, the preparation process of the camera become an obstacle to my work.<br />if the situation is slow and the light is fair the 775 is a very good camera.","This unit worked very well until it wore out.  The plastic zoom lense assembly started binding.  I used it fairly heavily for a little over a year and did not abuse it.  I dropped it about 5 times and did not baby it.","Optics do matter, and I guess the Nikon name is more than just print on a digital camera. I tried this in a test against a Fuji 2.3 mp digital camera, a model that I like a lot, and the Coolpix beat the Fuji for clarity on shots of the same resolution. By a long country mile, too. The lens here must be the difference.<br />The  features on the Coolpix include:<br />1. Lithium rechargeable battery (important.)<br />2. USB cable for fast transfer of pictures to the PC<br />3. Thumbnail display on the LCD on the back for quick review of shots<br />4. 5 different flash modes<br />5. A large 1.5 inch LCD display<br />6. Ability to do mini movies (avi)<br />7. 3X Optical Zoom (lens, not digital, very nice.)<br />8. Video out and cable in case you want to look at these on the family TV directly from the camera and not futz around on the computer.<br />The ergonomics are close to a regular point-and-shoot film camera. The settings dial is more or less easy to use; I tried the menu and setup on camera without using the manual and got it up and running right away. The \"out-of-box\" experience is enhanced by a large sheet of getting-started instructions that lead you through charging the battery in the separate charging station, loading the transfer software and taking a picture and getting it onto your PC.<br />The software includes ArcSoft \"PhotoImpression\" to manipulate your pictures. The interface is very simple and graphic with preview screens and virtual buttons.  I prefer Photoshop Elements for image manipulation, but if you aren't very handy with computer graphic software, PhotoImpressions leads you by the hand to get your pictures as you like them.<br />All in all, I'd have to say that this is a very good amateur digital camera for the price, delivering performance beyond my expectations.","The Nikon Coolpix 775 is simply the best camera investment I have ever made. The camera is very easy to operate, delivers beautiful premium quality photographs, and is compact enough to fit [literally] in your pocket. We have taken ours to the Caribbean, and gotten beautiful shots of beaches and palm trees. We have taken it skiing in France and Utah, and each time we were even able to take it with us on the slopes (yep, it really does fit comfortably into your pocket)! All in all, this is one amazing product. We got ours when it was fairly new, so we paid a great deal more than it is listed for here, but I assure you that even doing that was incredibly worth it! If you are a casual photographer who enjoys the fun of taking and sharing photographs of your adventures in life, this is the camera for you. I hope this is helpful to anyone interested in digital cameras or even just considering the investment. Enjoy!","This is a light, handy, and versatile 2 megapixel (fine for up to 5x7 prints) camera for entry level and most other non-professional digital photographers. It is easy to use, but the menu is not quite as intuitive as some other cameras, like the Canon ELPH series. Just read the manual, and play with the controls as you do, and you should be fine. It is not \"great\" for action shots, because the ISO equivalent default is 100. For soccer games, and other active settings this is a little slow, but if it is sunny, no problem. On dark days it will blur due to a slow shutter speed. Software installation is easy on both Macs and PCs, and battery life is acceptable. Also off-the-shelf camera batteries (Duracell 245 and other type 2CR5) will \"stand in\" while your supplied EN-EL1 is recharging. Some cameras will only work with the manufacturer's proprietary batteries. A 128 MB card will hold over 600 still pictures at medium resolution and compression, Movie mode is fun to use, but there is no sound, same as with the newer 885 and 4300 Nikons, and will usually take up 4-5 MB per 15 seconds. Its \"Achilles Heel\" is H20!!! Even while in my jacket pocket at a soccer tournament it allowed water inside the case and that \"fried\" (or should I say boiled or poached?) the camera to what Nikon said was a \"non economical repair\" status, not warranteed. I ordered another to replace it, but I will carry a zip lock bag around in the future. You would be well-advised to do the same, regardless of the model of camera that you end up with. My daughter will get the replacement 775 for Christmas, as her Mac is already set up for it, and I will begin using my new Canon ELPH S330, which has a few more features, and is also a \"pocket-sized\" 2 megapixel camera.","I've taken over 2,000 pictures with this camera and find it terrific except:<br />* Software Bug. If one takes pictures as fast as you can by repeatedly pressing the shutter button, the files writen to disk become corrupted when one transfers them to a PC using a Compact Flash to USB converter (Norton Disk Doctor helps to recover them).  If one turns on flash, then the flash slows down the picture taking to eliminate this problem.  If flash is off, one must makes sure the flashing green light (indicating it is writing a picture to compact flash), stops flashing before depressing the shutter button again.<br />* Auto Focus.  The auto focus does not always focus on the correct object, especially when the background distance is different from the subject distance, even w/ the subject clearly in the middle of the frame.  Many auto-focus cameras have this problem.  It think it would be helpful if the software took a small piece in the middle of the frame and expanded it 4x (to check focus) when you depress the shutter half way.<br />* No click. There is no audible noise after taking a picture; therefore, you don't know when and if it took, unless you look for the flashing green light.<br />* I found the the Nikon software to be buggy on Macintosh.  Subsequently, I bought a USB to compact flash converter, attached it to a Windows computer, and used this to move pictures to the windows computer.  Then, I installed ACDSee software on the Windows box, and am very happy w/ this setup.<br />Other than these issues, this camera is terrific. The optics are terrific, the color is terrific, the macro focus feature is terrific, the weight is terrific, the size is terrific, and the cost is terrific.<br />If I lost my 775 and needed a new camera ..., I would seriously consider the newer Nikon 2500 and Nikon 885, and tell the store I want to return the camera within 2 days if the shutter-button software bug is still there.","I put the Coolpix 775 on my wish list after I saw the amazing photos my friends have taken with theirs, and got it for my birthday this year.  I was off to the races.<br />THE GOOD:<br />It's small and light, and can fit in your pocket.  It's bigger than an Elph, but still quite manageable.  The first day I used it, I had it in my pocket while touring the Napa Valley in CA.  The buttons are easy to use and figure out (I've seen some BAD UI on a Sony Camera), and the industrial design is elegant and sleek.<br />The Coolpix has a bunch of photo modes, but honestly I haven't been able to see much difference between some of them.  Still, the Sunset mode has taken some spectacular shots for me, and I've experimented with Portrait and backlight modes as well, with good results.<br />For me, the meat and potatoes here is the ability to take macro-focused shots.  Being a designer means I like to have shots of textures, which means getting in close.  The macro mode is superb, and I have used it to great effect to get interesting textures from rusty metal, concrete, paper towels and bark.  It's also great for getting closeup shots of things like flowers and other plants.  I've even got good shots of my dog's muzzle.<br />The picture review mode is helpful as well, particularly the thumbnail mode.  You can sort through your photos quickly and delete the bad ones (this is one of the main reasons we get digital cameras in the first place, right?), and mark them for auto-transfer.  You can also zoom in on them if you want, though I've not seen the usefulness of that particular function yet.<br />The default memory card is 8 MB, which some people find to be small, but I find to be perfect.  One of the first things I did was to switch the picture quality to 640 x 480, 72 ppi.  I just don't take photos for print purposes, and i can take about 160 photos at low quality.  Users who want to take hi-res shots should probably get a 128 MB card to allow for good storage of fine-quality shots.<br />The rechargeable battery also has decent life, allowing me to take almost all of those 160 before showing a low battery warning.  Recharging takes a couple hours, though, so make sure to charge up before you head out to Disneyland for a long day of photography.<br />THE BAD:<br />Not much.  My biggest complaint was that the Nikonview software appeared buggy, although apparently the trouble I was having was easily corrected by re-seating the memory card and re-connecting to the computer via USB cable.  The transfer process is very straightforward, just plug the USB cable into the camera and hit the \"Transfer\" button.<br />I've taken about 300 photos (and those are the ones that I've kept) since getting this camera on the 10th of July, and will probably take thousands more.  It's my favorite toy.  I've been a web designer (hush, all you UF readers out there!) for going on seven years now, and in all that time, have never owned a digital camera.  Well, this is all the camera I need.  Bravo, Nikon.","This is a great camera for its size and has wonderful features and great for outdoor photography. I wish it had some manual features like adjusting aperture,as only drawback i see is that the flash is not powerful, and images need to be within 6 feet to be clear. And dont buy more than a 32Mb flash card cos the camera takes almost 10 sec to retrieve pics in preview mode, and the wait gets longer if you used a higer capacity flascard.","I was amazed at the quality of the photos with this tiny camera, even at medium resolution.  Because of that and its convenient size and weight, I'm totally satisfied (especially after using the bulky Sony Mavica).  There could be improvements, of course.  The Zooss capability is insignificant, and there is a rather long delay after pushing the button on flash setting before the picture is taken.","I thought this was a complicated camera when I first got it, than I read the book (parts of it). Now that I understand what all the little symbols on the top dial are for, it has become very simple to use. I have a problem however with the slow respose to the \"take a picture\" button. This seams to be a problem with many digital cameras. A friend has a top line 5MP camera which is not much quicker. (somthing for the digital people to work on) Never the less, this is a fine easy to use camera. Compared to some others it is a snap shoot. Printed a normal shot on a 11x17 HP1220c, came out fine, also an HP100 4x6 gloss--fabulouse.","Goes anywhere, great for all forms of family and vacation photography. Pass it around at a wedding for great informal pixs that will rival the paid photographer and it all fits in a shirt pocket.","I purchased my Nikon Coolpix 775 in Dec. of 2001.  As of June 3, 2002, I have taken over 3,200 photos with this camera.  I am VERY pleased with its small size and portability, the battery life, and the quality of pictures. It has a very good flash.<br />The only disappointment I have had is that it is the equivalent of an ISO 100 speed film, and if there is much movement at all<br />there will be a blur.  (For example, I took the camera to a basketball game and was unable to catch any of the action because everything blurred.)<br />For portraits, landscape, and general snapshots this camera is great, and I would recommend it to anyone who is not interested in capturing sports shots.","To all of you who had problems with the software - read the instructions! You only have to phone the company and they will talk you through what you have to do. They will also talk you through how to get the software to work if you have an updated windows program. Saying that once the software is installed it still isn't that great. I love the camera though. It goes easily in any bag I am carrying and has survived my 18month old dropping it to boot the photos are brilliant. And to the man who thought his wife's Kodak was better, wait until you see how long they last. I had to replace the two kodaks I have owned after less than two years!","This camera has been great for my needs and uses.  The battery supplied, rechargeable, takes about 150 flash shots.  After a night out pop it in the charger and your good to go the next morning.  Ive added a couple of media cards, last one to the tune of 256Mb which when coupled with that battery makes for a blast.  Its been proof tested on spring break trips to cancun and rosarito.  one chip for the whole vaction, 400 plus photos.<br />A fun filled camera to take out with you all the time. Drop it in your jacket, shorts, breifcase or...and go.  its also sized/designed great to take your own portraits...no need to get somebody else to take your photo... stick out your arm and do it...<br />its rugged enough for the occasional tumble (tested)<br />I prefer this design style to the manual shutter door type.  I  have had to many of those wear out.  Also like the preset photo modes... makes taking great photos real easy.  Indoor, outdoor, party, stars, beach....<br />love the features, size, and weight.  This camera has me thinking \"was it designed for my needs?\"<br />oh and the software comments... got me.. i just loaded it onto my laptop and it works great.  i never ran the demo.  plug it in, turn it on and the photos software pops up.  works great for me.","Don't let the size of this camera fool you. Many options allow you to adjust settings as required. Excellent detail and easy to use. I am impressed at how long the battery lasts compared with others. The only thing lacking is the speed of an SLR camera. I'm sure there are more options like shooting 16 frames continuously that would take care of that!","I started to write a not-so-flattering review, and then I started thinking about the incredible technology this camera includes. At the price, it is pretty amazing...still...<br />I have to admit that my wife's Kodak DC3400, bought on QVC, takes better photos.  This pains me to admit more than you can imagine. But same day, same subject, same light...the Kodak photos are sharper, better color and the Kodak doesn't suffer from the darned shutter delay.  This is really annoying if you are trying to get photos of something that is happening quickly and only once.  Taking photos of a glassblower with this shutter delay resulted in lots of photos of everything but the moment when the blob of glass becomes an object. Very frustrating.<br />And while it is a miracle of small size, it is simply too small. Live and learn. I'll keep it because I like having a camera in my briefcase at all times, and it is totally unobtrusive. But now I want something in the 4+ megapixel range, which is more SLR-like, and which has some heft.  I'll probably go the 995 or G2 route, although all my Sony products (except telephones, for some reason) have been terrific, so the 707 might work.  Why not go with another Kodak?  Stupid but true answer...not enough gee-whiz factor.","I bought the Nikon Coolpix 775 recently, and battled with the software for about 3 days until I finally called the company. They were helpful, until when I got off the phone the Cumulus software started saying it was full. Myself being not too computer literate, I was extremely aggravated. I got a friend to come over and solve the problem for me. Good thing, too, he told me that the Cumulus software was only a DEMO! I would not have had any idea, the product seemed to make it so that, in almost everyway (to me anyway), that this Cumulus nonsense was the software you were supposed to use. It takes you right to it automatically when you tell it to transfer, after all; not to the NikonView 4, which you are supposed to use from what I understand. So listen to the other reviews about \"lousy software\" because they are most definately not lying. If you have any problems don't bother fiddling with it for hours, a helpful Nikon employee should help you just fine. Besides the software, however, the product is, I find, great. The pictures are crystal, and can truely make something look a lot better and brighter than it really may be, especially rooms, various other indoor subjects, etc. It is also very easy to use, charge, and upload your subjects onto your computer (once you have the \"lousy software\" deciphered). Good Luck with you camera.<br />*PS: This would have been 5 stars hadn't it been for the aweful software that came with the product.*","Have 2 year old HP computer with a windows 98 upgrade second edition.  Have not been able to upload pictures from camera to computer.  Nikon states that the camera is incompatible with a windows 98 upgrade.<br />Nikon recommends using computer with straight 98 or a card reader.","I've been using the Coolpix 775 for a few weeks now and absolutely love it!<br />The different settings make it really easy to get the shot just right and of course it also works well on the Auto setting. There's a delay between pressing the button and actually taking the picture but I've noticed that with all digital cameras (the Elph S110 seems even slower).<br />An extra battery pack is nice to have, but I have to say that the one that comes with the camera lasts fairly long. Of course, you will have to buy an extra memory card unless you intend to take low-quality photos (i.e. for websites and e-mails) only. My 128MB card gives me 133 shots on highest quality.<br />When I picked up 10x5 prints today I couldn't tell a difference between them and 'normal' photos taken with a 35mm camera.<br />The only dissapointment is the software that comes with it... it is really bad! I've been uploding photos in Windows Explorer, then I copy them into My Documents for storage. I am thinking about buying a card reader to make it even easier and to save battery power.<br />Even though the software is bad, I still rate the camera 5 stars!","Small enough to take anywhere, easy to use without reading directions, would probably be even better if I read the directions. Downloading photos is simple. The only thing I  bad I would say is that it is sometimes tempermental about when it will take the photo, you push the button and then nothing happens so you push it again and it works, sometimes you have to push the button a couple times...","This was my first digital camera and all in all I am very happy with the camera itself. It has many features, is easy to use and it does take great pictures; the flash is quite exceptional as well. There are many features which makes reading the manual a must otherwise you'll be lost especially if you're a first timer like me. The problem with this camera is the software. Cumulus, by Canto, is actually a very good, powerful, organizational software program. However, for the average to moderately involved photographer it is simply way too cumbersome. I spent about 8 hours one day figuring out how to use it and once I did it was actually pretty good. The bad news is that once you've made your catelogs you can only dump about 50 pictures into it and then the Cumulus program will ask you to buy the \"full\" program at around... because the \"limited\" version they give you has been maxed out. Nikon really should do better to serve their customers with adequate software or they will loose business.<br />Bottom line: get the camera...avoid the software (unless you're prepared to buy the entire cumulus program).","Highly recommend the camera for its small size, picture quality and ease of operation.  The Nikon view software is a piece of junk, couldn't get it working on my PC, Nikon Tech support passed the buck to  my PC manufacturer and Microsoft. In the end I bought a Sandisk Compact flash reader and trashed Nikon view (and the  cataloging demo software that came the camera) also changed my editing software to Photo suite although the included photoimpressions did a reasonable job.<br /> My advice buy the camera and  a Sandisk compact flash reader  the flash looks just like another disk drive , and you don't have to run your camera to transfer pictures to your PC.","I just got the Nikon 775 for my birthday. The software doesn't work. IT doesn't work with my computer which is only a year old. I had been given a lexar memory card reader and discover that I can get my picture throught that and it improves the pictures alot. I love this camera I have read reviews and heard people having trouple with the camera or the flash being really bad. I find the flash is great and I just love all the setting it comes with.  I just found out that the cable that comes with my camera is a firewire and NOT a usb explaining why my camera does not work with my computer but does work with the Mac cub which has built in firewire.  I have also gotten the new portable HP Photosmart printer and the two together work great.  I can print out great pictures that makes people go wow that came from a digital camera.  It's a great camera to get but you will run into problems but you also run into problem with any thing electrric.<br /> I've used alot of digital cameras I've use both still and professional panasonic 5000 which has a great picture and I find tha tthis camera does have the same quility has the 5000. Its a great camera for family trips or dances.","Excellent camera.  I have several digital cameras and if you are looking for a fun, easy-to-use one - the 775 is great.  The resolution is perfect and I find it extremely easy to use with Windows XP and the Nikon software.  Happy shooting........","I have had my Nikon Coolpix 775 for almost four months and have taken about 800 pictures with it...it's just so much fun to use! And easy to use, as well. It will function as a simple point and shoot on \"auto\" mode and give you your money's worth, but with seven scene modes to choose from, it's a lot of fun to explore the possibilites.<br />I've experimented a bit with some of the other features this nifty little camera has - such as macro and continuous shots - and I look forward to getting more familiar with them.<br />This is an ideal camera for someone who wants to have fun but still take good, sharp pictures.  It's so compact and light-weight, you can literally take it with you virtually anywhere you go and always be ready for a quick snap-shot, or even a mini movie!","I started out in Digital Photography with a low-end digital camera.  While it produced pretty good pictures, I really knew it was my \"test\" introduction to Digital.  I decided to move up and get a better digi-cam.  While I can't afford to move up to the top of the line digital Nikon, this one has been great.  At first I was a little frustrated with the speed it seemed to operate at, but on a trip to the Auto Show, I took over 100 shots and realized the delay is in the memory recording process, not the actual picture taking.  The exposure level is spot on, but I wish I had some ability to control the focus. My film-based Nikon has manual, spot & wide, and I'd like to see the same type of focus area control.  I have ended up with a few shots where the background was in focus and the subject was blurry.  Battery life is good, and you will want to get at least a 64 or 128 megabyte card to go with it.  8 meg is not enough for good usage. The 15 second video feature is kinda fun as well.","I've had a Coolpix 990 for over a year now, and I decided to get it's little brother (Coolpix 775) for my wife to use.  It's perfect for her, since there is not a lot of manual options on it, only auto and presets.<br />The size is perfect, small enough for a purse, and we like the shape of the case for gripping.  It doesn't feel like you could drop it, like many other subcompact cameras do. And, it takes digi pics that seriously rival the pics from my Coolpix 990.<br />The only downsides are -<br />1. It doesn't use AA batteries like the 990.  However, I simply bought an extra NiMH battery, so there's always a charged one when she needs it.<br />2. The camera is kinda slow after you snap the pic. i.e.- It makes you wait while it's saving to the compact flash card. But, what's the hurry anyway?<br />3. It only comes with 8 meg compact flash. But, that's actually good, because if it came with 16, the price would probably go up, whereas you'd still want to buy another card - I bought an extra 64Meg for 37 dollars US.<br />So, since all shortcomings can be overcome or overlooked, I have to give this camera 5 stars","I have read lots of reviews about this camera, some were good and some were bad so I bought it.  I have this camera for about 2 weeks now and I am very disappointed.  There were more problems encountered than what the reviews stated.  The reviews written were more biased towards how great this camera is, though it should emphasize the problems it really has.<br />Need to compare???  One way of telling how good a camera performs is by comparing it to others especially if the lower/cheaper models could outshine this one.<br />I own the Kodak DC3200 ... and the Olympus Brio D-150 ... Digital camera. As for comparisons to the Nikon 775 ..., the Kodak DC3200 took clearer pictures.  The Kodak is only 1 mega pixel but the pictures were sharper and colors were closer to what your eye would see outdoors.  Indoors, the Kodak tends to overexpose (too bright) the subject while in the flash range.  The Kodak pictures taken are clear from the beginning without shrinking the image.  The Nikon on the other hand have pictures that are not as clear full size, but when printed on a 4x6 it becomes clearer.  Therefore it would be hard to get a clear picture with the Nikon when looking at it on your computer.  These pictures are not as appealing when posting it on the net.<br />As for the Olympus, it has better color tones but it was somewhat blurry as well (not too sharp).  I guess it helps when taking pictures of people so it can give the subject a smoother look and to hide any imperfections.  For detailed pictures, this might not be a good camera to get.  There are more comparisons to discuss but I would not spend any more time at it.  More focus would be emphasized on the Nikon 775 below.<br />Here are my own observations of the Nikon Coolpix 775:<br />I have taken indoor, outdoor, flash, macro, increased sharpness settings, white balance.....<br />First of all there were red and blue/green rainbow colors on the pictures.  Those imperfections are there no matter what settings.  There would be blotchy red spots in the pictures typically but the blue/green colors are there too.  Some settings reduce those color imperfections but it does not eliminate it.  If you take pictures of a subject that contains those colors, it will hide through those colors thus slightly emphasizing the color red, blue and green.  That would be fine with me, but it should not come out on areas where those colors are not present.  It seems to form in horizontal bands, but it also appears randomly across the picture.  These bands are not pronounced but it is seen fairly easily.  These abnormal colors are more distinct in gray and in typical skin colors (flesh).<br />As far as software is concerned, there will always be bugs in it including your own operating system.  You can use other picture editing software once you upload the pictures to your computer through via USB.  Transfer Errors also occurred while uploading pictures sometimes.  Check with Nikon for updates.<br />Another problem would be sunspots on the pictures.  They only appeared on shots I took indoors with the flash.  The spots would appear as if you placed tiny droplets of water on the lens.  It does not appear all the time, but it appears once in while in random places.  I fear that the flash itself may have caused it to appear.<br />Significant Delay Problem???  Press the button... Click...  1 to 2 seconds later...  Snap...  Picture taken.<br /><br />The red eye reduction does not work too well.  The red eye is still pronounced on the pictures I took.  Of course, red eye will always be severe on shots taken inline with the flash.  In other words, the closer to the center the subjects are, the red eye would be more severe.<br />Lastly, one thing nice about this camera is its size and weight so you can easily put it in your pocket.  But when I placed it on my jean pocket, the lint/dust in that pocket or some sort of particles penetrated inside the camera.  It has fogged up the viewfinder inside (between the front and rear glass) with dust/lint looking things.  I could see some of the dust settling on the lens as well.  Both those areas are supposed to be sealed when not in use especially the viewfinder internally.<br />Now for what I liked about the Nikon camera:<br />The 3x zoom is a plus.  Its ergonomics makes it easy to hold.  I like the dial settings of different moods on the Nikon 775, which the Canon S110 lacks (currently the 2 most popular cameras).  The Nikon has a special function for macro shots instead of just zooming in close to take clearer pictures.  The movie shots are good as well, but it lacks sound.<br />I won't complain about the 8mb flash card, its obvious by now that it is not enough and it has nothing to do with the 3 stars given.  Anyways, Flash memory is cheap these days.  It is better for the camera manufacturers not to spend more money on the memory initially to keep the cost lower.  Since memory prices generally goes down all the time, it is to the advantage of the consumer in the long run.<br />The Nikon comes with a rechargeable battery that last pretty long.  For international travel, the 100-240Volt charger (included) helps.  The battery never ran out on me for the whole day.  It just depends how you use the camera.  Previewing pictures all the time means using the LCD screen often thus consuming more power.<br />In conclusion:<br />To me, keeping this camera means it should satisfy 5 main factors; Image quality, features, convenience, size and reliability.  In my opinion, this Nikon Coolpix 775 needs more improvements especially on image quality.  If this is one of the best in its class the market could give at this time, then so be it.  You decide on your own!","I'm a computer geek who has resisted the digital camera bug for a long time.  In our house, we have an extensive collection of conventional still cameras, from the ever useful 35mm Minolta and Nikon, with their full assortments of lenses, to a fine old twin-lens Rollei and antique 8x10 glass negative cameras.  While I'll put an 8x10 negative up against any digital image any day--it is much easier, not to mention instantly gratifying, to slip the tiny 775 into a purse, hip pack, or briefcase, take a record shot or two and ship them off to friends and family within minutes.<br />This tiny wonder is incredibly easy to use, takes splendid pictures for online viewing, and the basic software, Nikon View 4 USB upload/image manager, worked just fine on PCs both at home and office with Windows2000.  As for accessories, I do recommend splurging for the AC adapter, though.  The little Kodak case is handy, too.  It provides enough protection to keep the camera clean, keep the buttons from accidently being pressed--and fits like a glove.  It also looks much snappier than bubble pack with a rubberband. ;-)","I purchased this digital camera last summer.  The 2 main reasons I chose it were its size and its movie feature.  It really is small and I can carry it with me wherever I go, but as far as the movie feature goes, I haven't used it yet.<br />I like to take pictures of my 1 1/2 year old son and since he is constantly on the go, it's hard to get a great shot with this camera because there is a few second delay between when you push the button to take the picture and when the picture is taken.  I end up missing a lot of great shots.<br />The camera itself is very easy to use and I don't have any trouble working it or transferring pictures to my computer, but the delay really bothers me.","I did a ton of research on digital cameras and I decided on the 775. You cant beat the price and it's loaded with features.  If you like taking pictures like me, and you want a camera you can point and shoot. This is the one for you. I must have taken 200 pictures with this camera in a 3-4 week period (night, day, sunny, cloudy, sporting events, parties...). All perfect. You cant go wrong. You just select which scene mode applies to your setting and shoot away. It cant get any easier then that. The photos I print are incredible. I am so happy I jumped to digital. No more praying for good pictures. I give the 775 two thumbs up. WOW!<br />One very happen Nikon customer.","I love this camera. We got it for Christmas and have taken tons of pictures with it. The zoom capabilities are unbelieveable. It is lightweight and easy to use.<br />I recommend it for the novice digital photographer.","My first digital camera - after doing a bunch of research zeroed in to this one: has yet to let me down.<br />P.S. Heard a lot of horror stories regarding the life of digital camera battries in general, this one comes bundled with a rechargable battery and charger - has a surprisingly long charge time and does the job perfectly well for me.","I selected this camera particularly because that while it has a rechargable battery, that if necessary you can use a 'one use' battery (2CR5).  My wife has a Canon Elph.  While this is smaller, it is consideably less simple to use. I particularly like the 8 different settings that automatically set things like white balance and flash mode.  Of course, it takes great pictures!","Got the 775 as my first digital camera.  I read and researched about digital cameras and decided to go with the Nikon 775.  I was a bit apprehensive about loading the software after reading reviews from people who had difficulty with it due to other programs that they had on their computers.  I also have Media Player 7.0 and the CDcreator program that others had trouble with, but my software loaded easily, and I had no difficulties with it.  (I did not load the trial software)<br />I like the size of the camera and I think that the pictures come out fairly well, the colors are pretty good and the red eye reduction works on this camera for me.  I am a bit disappointed with taking pictures in a fairly low lit room, as it is difficult to see anything on the screen before you take the picture.  Because it is difficult to see, you end up trashing pictures and retaking them.  There is also a bit of wait time when you press the button to release the shutter and flash and when they actually go off.  I suppose I will get used to the delay, but may hinder taking action pictures when not taking a sequence of them.  All in all, I find it is a good camera for my first digital and I found it easy to use, by just trying out the buttons, and not really reading the directions in the book.","The demo version of Cumulus is a joke. I was able to load only 30 pictures across 3 uploads and then the application locked up saying I'd exceeded the maximum catalog size or maximum number of simultaneously open catalogs. And it appears to cost [price] to get a real working version. Why does Nikon even bother to include demo software that is so very limited? It's surely not enough to get a feel for the Cumulus product, and it has now colored my whole experience. My advice is just ignore this Cululus piece completely upon install. Other than this, camera has been fine so far.","After researching digital cameras, I decided to go with the Nikon 775, for my first digital camera.  I had read the other reviews before I bought this and was a bit apprehensive about the software that came with it.  Others had mentioned problems they had installing the software because of other programs that they had, like CDCreator, and Media Player 7.0.  I have both of these things, and did not have any difficulty with the software.  It loaded quickly and easily. (Although I did not install the trial software.)<br />The camera was fairly easy to use and figure out by pressing the buttons, and not reading the manual.  I have only tried the automatic features so far, but I think that the color is generally pretty good on the pics.  I do find it a bit annoying that when you take a pic. in low light, it is hard to see what you are aiming at, and thus, you have a misaligned picture, that usually needs to be trashed.  Another thing that is a bit annoying is that when you press the button to take the pic., there is a bit of hesitation before the flash goes off and pic. is taken.  I guess it is something that you have to adjust to, and after speaking to a friend, I hear that it happens on other brands as well.<br />All in all, it is an easy to use, light and compact camera that gives the user a lot of options for the money.","While this camera does an acceptable job, you can probably do better for the money.  The AUTO setting is very misleading.  It is really more of a manual setting.  I have been using a Milota camera for years and find it took better quality pictures with less need for adjustment.  A friend told me that he has two relatives who actually returned Nikon digital cameras after initial use.","The Nikon 775 Coolpix digital camera is a great camera no matter where you are. It has 3x optical and 2.5x digital zoom so you can get close up. It can shoot a 15 second video. The package comes with the camera, a lon lasting rechargable li-lon battery, 8mb compact flash card, battery charger, 2 cords to hook it up to your computer and one to hook it up to a tv or a vcr. Its pictures are great quality with its 2.1 mega pixel. It weighs less than 6.5 oz.","I love this camera.  I got it for Christmas and i have had the best time learning how to use it.  It is easy as anything to learn.  I like taking it to party's and stuff.  It's a great deal","I like almost everything about this camera.  It is easy enough to get started quickly; but, it has plenty of advanced capabilities to explore.  The rechargeable battery is terrific.  The size and shape are perfect for me.  The picture quality on screen and in printouts seems quite good if taken in bright light. The only drawback I've noticed is the poor quality in low light situations.  The multi mode flash works great but only within a short range.","This is a great little camera if you are looking for a fun compact digital camera for email and photo printing.  The camera is very simple to operate, and the software was a snap to load and use on the computer.  The camera comes with everything you need to get started except a sufficient flash card.  It comes with the 8mb flash card which is not enough to do anything with.  But Nikon is not alone in supplying such little memory, just about every camera in this price range come with the same size flash card.  The camera takes great pictures and is definitely a bargain.  You can find them for a great price if you look hard enough.","I have been delighted with the quality of this little gem. I had a much more expensive Mavica which I donated to a local school because they needed its simplicity and I needed something that would take quality shots. I got one of the 96 mg cards to go with it and use the \"best quality\" setting. We're leaving soon for vacation and looking forward to trying it out even more...","It's been a month since I bought the camera, and so far it has proven to be a smart buy.I bought the camera for [amt] from one of the internet photo stores. The 7 \"scene modes\" do a good job for automatically setting aperture and exposure settings. However, those willing to be experiment will be rewarded with a pleasant surprises. What's really interesting with the scene modes is that they have uses beyond the names of the situations that they target. Try Sunset during the day, for example, for a more Golden Hour look. Try Beach/Snow on a back-lit subject for a different, moodier sort of lighting. You can really experiment with this little Nikon.<br />The colors are wonderfully accurate, even with the auto setting. There is a manual white balance in addition to the 5 \"preset white balance settings.\" Just place a white piece of object in front of the camera, and it will automatically adjust the color balance of the shot. This is really great when you have multiple sources of lights and/or if you know you have sufficient light and don't want to use the flash. Contrary to what another reviewer has said in here that may be misleading, I haven't yuet found a single instance where there are red/blue/breen banding on pictures taken with sufficient light. He is probably talking about the amount of noise in the picture when a scene is taken without sufficient lighting (very low light conditions). I still have to experience the \"sunspots\" he was referring to when taking photos with the speedlight (Nikon's word for flash).<br />Some of the photos do not come as sharp as I'd like them to be (at least on screen), but when I printed them out on a 6-color Epson photo printer, they look amazingly like normal 35-mm prints. This camera (like those from Sony, Epson, Casio, etc.) saves additional info in its JPEG files called \"Print Image Matching (PIM)\" that when printed on PIM-enabled photo printers, the colors are richer and hues truer to what you actually saw when you took the photo.<br />All the above plus the 3x-zoom and the ultra-compact and go anywhere light weight makes this camera a smart buy. Simple interfaces and modes for casual point and shooters while giving amateur photoenthusiasts a lot of options for experimentation even if it doesn't truly have a manual mode like the more expensive cameras. Plus the batteries and recharger are included!","at least be fair about it. To take a few pictures in a store, then come on Amazon and write a negative review is totally lame.<br />I just bought a Nikon 775. I love it. I narrowed it down to either the 775 or the Fuji 2800, both were the same price. The Fuji has more zoom features, but I am using this as a \"point and click\" camera, so the Nikon's 3x zoom should be plenty for my needs.<br />The 775 is the perfect size, has a great manual and is ready to go right out of the box. If you are looking for a 2 mil pixel camera..., go with the Nikon 775, you won't be sorry.","The quality of images are very good and the color reproduction is excellent (blues ARE blue). It is easy to use and have a good \"get started\" guide which literally have you taking your first picture in 30 seconds. The manual, however, is messy, confusing and poorly written (should be better).<br />The grip is very comfortable and it's light weight makes it easy to handle (you don't get tired). It just fit very nicely in your hand. Very good job by Nikon here..<br />The quality of the pictures for 2 m.pixel cameras is excellent and when printed in 4x6 and 5x7 size prints it looks like real fotos. My 8x10 are acceptable, but if you usually print this size I recommend buying a 3 or 4 mega pixel camera.<br /><br />The 3xZoom is good, the macro feature fantastic (you can get REALLY close), but I have a small problem with the lcd monitor. It is very dark and does not accurately show what your picture will look like untill it has been taken (colors and light). At least the refresh rate is fast.<br />The auto setting produces very good results. There are 7 \"program\" modes which can be used, but in most of the cases \"auto\" get the best results. Excellent control of white balance in auto mode. It really covers all possible scenarios.<br />The movie mode is ok, but I dont recommend selecting a camera based on it's ability to play movies.<br />I simply love the 'play back' functions. You can make a still picture slide show in the build in lcd monitor, or through a supplied cable get the output on TV (pal or ntsc as you like). It is fantastic to see your pictures in 36\" size .. what an impact. The TV out feature is really good and usefull.<br />I recommend you buy an extra battery as the lithium-ion battery supplied last about 1-2 hours of shooting depending on use.<br />Unfortunatly you can not use the battery charger as an AC adapter so unless you buy one at an additional expense you will be using battery when transferring files to your computer. In emergency cases a disposable lithium ion 2crv5 battery (from the supermarket) can be used.<br />Conclusion: the main objective we had when buying this camera was to capture pictures which looked \"right\" (color,light etc) and which would allow us to print in 4x6 size with occational 5x7 and 8x10 prints without it screems DIGITAL.. the camera more than satisfied our expectations.<br />Note: we have not used the enclosed software, but bought a compactFlash reader (to save battery) and it works wonderfully.","Immediately after purchase I took shots of my son's birthday party at the Rainforest Cafe which is admittedly low indoor light and on vacation in New Orleans where it was sunny and 80degrees fahrenheit with great outdoor weather. I was extremely disappointed upon return since I tried to print about 5 out of my best 128 ++ shots and was advised by both NikonNet and Ofoto that I shouldn't print higher than 4x6 (I shot these on Full and fine quality on a 128mb card)! Another reviewer complained about washed out colors. Don't commit to this until you try printing -the ultimate test - most anything looks good on your computer screen. Terribly disappointed because I now have a boatload of expensive addons to deal with.","for its features, there is no better combination than the coolpix 775. have to admit that the software was buggy but i have been using a pmcia card adapter to transfer pictures between my digicam and notebook. But if you look at nikontechusa.com, they have just released the new software a few days ago. try it to see if it solves your problems. the only bad thing i don't like is its slowness in flashing but then again, i haven't really finished studying the features yet so i might be using the wrong setting","for its features, there is no better combination than the coolpix 775. have to admit that the software was buggy but i have been using a pmcia card adapter to transfer pictures between my digicam and notebook.

This camera is TERRIBLE in low lighting.  If you are more than 12 inches away from your subject forget about the picture turning out.  I've tried all of the available settings and none of them help.<br />The only way I've been able to get acceptable shots was to manually set the Exposure to 2.0+ (the max setting!) This setting makes the images a little grainy.<br />If this camera were better in low light I would have rated it 5 stars.  If low light doesn't concern you, BUY THIS CAMERA!  It's SUPER light, SMALL and comes with a rechargeable battery pack!  The rechargeable battery last a long time.  Like I said before, I use this camera primarily at night so the flash goes off with every picture.  I have a 32MB and 2-8mb Compact Flash Cards and I can fill them both (about 250 pictures!) before the battery drains..<br />If Nikon can make the next version of this camera better for low light situations it will be unbeatable in the Price to Performance category.<br />Hope this HONEST review helps.<br />[...]","Great compact point-and-shoot camera.<br /> - Small, compact, easy to use....it fits in our diaper bag!<br /> - comes with Lithion battary + charger<br /> - super easy transfering of images via a USB port.<br /> - pre-set setting making it a breeze to get the right picture<br /><br />You'll definitley need to buy a bigger memory card; 8M won't cut it if you're looking to shoot more than 15 shoots in \"fine mode\".  That is if you're looking to print 8x10's..... Prints are sharp, crisp, clear, true in color......all around EXCELLENT photos.  Not to mention the price has come down, which should make even more attractive.","I like this little camera.  It has all the future I want, and the software installatiion is just fine.  I recommend to everyone this camera in this price range.","I have had the camera for about 4 months and am very happy with it. The camera is small, fits in your shirt pocket. It has alot of features of much more costly cameras. I have printed pictures, and the quality is outstanding!! We just made a Christmas card using it to take our picture on timed delay, with my tripod. I would recommend it to anyone. It is a must to buy the power cord for it (not included). I bought the camera with very little knowledge of photo practices. I have been having fun just with trial and error shooting. Buy this camera online and you will save a bunch!!  Rick","I have never owned a digital before now. I bought my Nikon775<br />about a month ago. The thing I love is you can delete what you<br />don't like. I keep thinking all the money I spent on developing & now I can transfer them to the computer. The size is awesome. & fits into your shirt pocket for quick access. I still have alot of experiencing to do with it, which is fun. I'm sure anyone who buys this camera will enjoy it as much as I do.","Read several reviews, shopped online for a great price, and my first experience with a digital camera proved to be more satisfying that expected.  The size and multiple functions give me ease of carrying and more features than I'll probably ever use.  The cables supplied allow me to view shots on my PC or even on the family TV. No complaints at all as it is the handiest point and shoot I've owned (Sony Nuvius & Canon IXUS M1). Now I'm wondering whether I'll ever go back to my Nikkormat SLR. Looking forward to learning to use all the capacities of this little gem with photoshop manipulation and colorprinting as soon as I find the time. (N.B. Can lead to OCD!)","I just got it yesterday and LOVE it.  The styling, size, LCD quality....\"Cheater\" icons to help the beginner with settings for backlighting, portraits, landscape, lots of white, etc. and offer advance users ways to push shutter speed and focal distance so it is way more than just a point and shoot.  The macro capability is awesome.  The 8MB card managed to hold about 15 full sized high-res images, so the 64 ought to hold around 60, with more in the smaller sizes.  Meanwhile it comes with batteries and a charger, unlike the similarly priced Canons.<br />My only quibble so far is the software....perhaps a demo would help explain it.  It hung my laptop twice, and it will take some effort to figure out how to name and organize images, or to edit them.  Nikon apparently offers a Live Interactive Manual on their site (new!) but I've been unable to open it w/o hanging my computer.  Anyhow, I'll figure it out or replace the software, but the camera is an excellent buy!","I obviously didn't expect a camera that is a fraction of the price of the 995 to match it in quality, however I did expect better than this.  The camera has positives and negatives:<br />Positives:<br />a.  As with all Nikon digitals as of yet, you can't beat the macro mode.<br />b.  The camera comes with a rechargable lithium-ion battery.  However, in a pinch, you can walk into pretty much any drugstore or camera store and purchase a 2CR5 battery that will also run the camera (that's one positive this camera has over the comparable Canon).<br />c.  Nice, small body.<br />Negatives:<br />a.  Image quality isn't fantastic.  I've seen other 2 megapixel digicams that blow this away, specifically the Olympus 2100 and Nikon's Coolpix 950.<br />b.  Body is all plastic.  Some see this as a positive because it decreases the weight, however I like something made of metal because its generally more sturdy and the weight doesn't really bother me.<br />c.  The LCD screen is fairly small.<br />d.  To attach the accessory lenses, you have to use a very chintzy, goofy looking adapter (the UR-E3).  It wraps around the whole camera.<br />e.  Only comes with an 8mb card (comes on Nikon...8mb isn't enough for anyone).<br />f.  I have yet to see a Nikon come with a *good* software package, and this camera is no exception.  In terms of the software you get with digital cameras, the stuff Olympus and Canon bundle with their cameras blows away the stuff Nikon includes.<br />It's decent, but for the money you could probably do much better.  If the size of the camera isn't important, there are other 2mp cameras in the same price range that are a little bigger but much better.","This my first digital camera, and I found this one very easy to use. I have not had any problems with the camera. I have read many complaints about color from this model, but to my surprise, indoors or outdoors, it has been excellent. I take close up pictures of military models that I build and they have turned out excellent.<br /><br />I did not install all of the software bundle only the nikon software. I have my own viewers and editors, and I hate demos and uninstalling them or the pop up banners.<br /><br />All and all I am very pleased and would purchase again if I had to do it over again.","I'm your average intelligent person but I am terrified of anything to do with loading and poking around computers, I've worked in high tech for over 12 years but whenever my computer hiccups I pick up the phone and call helpdesk. So I was amazed that I figured out how to load the software on both my office Win2K and home Win98 computers with minor issues - one being I couldn't figure out how to eject the hardware device before unplugging the USB and my camera. Love the ease of the controls, great pictures, lots of options, Flash is not great but gosh these are little cameras ergo... One disappointment however, is the editing software - it (is bad) - cumulus schmumulus - hello Nikon - are you absolutely NUTS? I want to use this camera not get into a lifelong relationship with Cumulus or go to school to have to figure out how to catalog this stuff. Canon is creaming you on their packaged in the box software including elemental photoshop! I got free ofoto software and it is fine for starters but now I have to go buy photoshop or something equivalent at an arm and a leg. Ditto what a previous reviewer said - Shame on NIkon! I still love my little camera though. Within 24 hours of getting it (again - I'm a technophobe) my hubby and my 2 year old are up on my desktop as my wallpaper (thanks to Ofoto!)","The Nikon 775 is my first use of a digital camera after using a Canon EOS for many years. I am very impressed with the photo's which printed very well on a low cost epson 600. I found the macro feature very good for converting my old slides to digital (used backlite slide viewer and tripod- no problem). I have a Intel PII 400 using WinMe and found no problems using the Nikon supplied software, using PSP Ver 7.02 for editing. The only feature I miss is not having manual focus, suggest that anyone doing macro get a camera with manual focus to be sure, to be sure.","This has got to be the best, fun camera I have owned. I have used 35 mm camera's and Digital camera's for years not as a professional but for the joy of taking pictures. This little camera is easy to use, lite, and takes very good pictures. If you don't know anything about camera's, it doesn't matter, this little camera is simple to use. I read about nikon's software problems with computers, didn't waste my time with it, I purchased a flashcard reader and glad I did, this has got to be the best way to transfer pictures to your computer. Don't waste your time with serial or USB. Two things I would recomend extra battery and flash card, because you'll be taking so many pictures you won't want to stop.","I own the 775 and i have also used olympus 340L and D-450Zoom extensively for work.  I also have used the canon elph? (not sure which model but it has 2.1 megapixels and it is smaller than the nikon).<br />In my humble opinion:<br />1. olympus cameras have better picture quality, my nikon tends to blur a lot because it is so light and hard to hold steady<br />2. the canon can record sound on their short movies, as well as take continuous pics using FLASH, while the nikon forces you to disable flash if you want to take continuous pics.  The canon seems to have a better lcd screen, the nikon's screen \"blinks\" when you move it...<br />Overall, i think the canon model is better even though it is a little more expensive than the nikon...  Keep in mind that the canon is made of metal and it is a lot heavier, though smaller.","I bought this camera about two months ago after many weeks of research. I am overall satisfied. The only complaint I have is that the zoom is not that great. It is so small its about the size of the palm of your hand. You can take a picture in pitch black and it comes out clear as day. It is very fast and simple to transfer pics onto you computer. I would highly recomend this camera if you are not looking for alot of zoom. If I can give one peice of advice DO NOT BUY A SONY!!! Go with Nikon or Cannon.","It is easy to be programed, and photo-transfer is quick too, one picture per second, not like someone's complaint in software conflict. 8M flash card saves 15 photos with normal full size (1600*1200 pixals). After charging battery two hours, you can shot right away. The technical support guys in Nikon are knowledgeable and work efficiently. Also, the price for brand new (one year warrant, not refurbished) is reasonable (...).","HP, Toshiba, Nikon(I own now), Polaroid (no longer have)<br />I have taken same pictures with all four cameras and compared.<br />There so many things I want to talk about these digital cameras but since I dont' have all day I'll mention things that I liked or hated the most.<br />First of all all these cameras listed have all nice picture qualities.  I used auto mode on all four and they all had shown slight different contrast and color balance.  They were all unique to one another but not bad at all.  I can tell all the digital camera shoppers out there \"digital cameras in general nowadays shares similar technologies and they are all not bad at all taking photos\"  Probably you should look for the one that looks the best on you or what kind of special features they have.<br />Yes I also looked at all the CNET reviews and for the average users would not be able to tell much a difference.  ...  I am not saying CNET is not a reliable source.  However, I just CANNOT believe all of their reviews.  Most of times I prefer customer's review sometimes.<br />My review might contradict a lot of CNET reviews.<br />First Digital camera I bought was Toshiba PDR-M4 came with all I need(adapter and rechargable Lithium Ion battery is big plus)  and the best LCD I've ever seen.  love their multi shot mode.  Fastest reaction camera among these four.  it's fun, easy to use, and it works!!  no optical zoom would be the weakest point.<br />Nikon Coolpix 775 is very small yet feature packed camera.  It even has movie mode(no sound).  Picture quality is also very nice.  Definitly should buy their original case(silver color).  it runs only $...(retail) and it fits perfect.  Very easy to change mode since there is a dial does it all.  Only complain I have is it makes clicking noise when you move the camera. It constantly adjusting and focusing.  kinda slow reaction.  Ok LCD display.<br />HP 618ix is traditional typical Pentax looking camera.  It dosn't have much features but takes excellent pictures.  It's got Pentax lense and it's a good thing.  once again slow reaction but very solid camera.  can record voice on the photo you take.  I ended up buying a Rayovac 1hr charger and extra battery pack.  It doesn't last long as I wanted them to but good enough.(1 hr means really 1 hr).  very nice grip when taking pictures.  Looks like LCD on HP and Nikon are the similar type but worse than Nikon.  zooming in when reviwing picture makes picture blur and hard to see.  Another thing I din't like was there is playback mode and file management mode where you have to be in file manage mode to erase pictures you took not in play back mode.  kinda annoying.<br />Polaroid Photomax2300Z is a vanilla 2.3x optical zoom camera.  Nothing special about it almost boring but it works.  It is too big compare to other three.  it's got rubber covers on the usb connector side and feels very cheap.  Cannot have one finger operation on the dial and feels cheap again.  Still take good photos just couldn't measure up against other cameras out there.<br />These are the things you should look for on digital cameras nowadays considering they all pretty much take good photos.<br />1. price range(budget it first)<br />2. reaction time between shot to shot<br />3. special features<br />4. contants(rechargably battery and adapter)<br />4. look and the built quality","Ignore the nay-sayers, this is an EXCELLENT camera!  This is my first digital camera, but I tend to be a very picky gadget freak and not easily impressed.  From the first experience of opening the box, to barely reading the manual (not needed) to taking pictures and uploading them, this camera is great.<br />I know people complain about compatibility issues with the USB upload and EZ CD Creator.  Maybe so, but this is actually a big bug in EZ CD Creator and not really Nikon's fault.  In any case, avoid this entire issue and spend $... on a card reader.  I don't even bother with plugging in/out the camera, itself.  I just use a reader.  It's the best way to go.  Once this is done, you have a GREAT little camera that takes spot-on great pictures, good lense, the right features for good picture-taking without the typical gimics.  For instance, there is a \"standard\" program-modes dial, just like on an SLR, for various situations.  This is just what you want for such a small and lightweight snapshot camera.  The camera is very light, very small, fits well in one's hand and feels like quality.<br />As I say, buy a card reader and an extra 64MB or 128MB card and you're set.  It's a super piece.  I highly recommend it.","The Coolpix 775 is my first digital camera buy. I finally found a camera with all the features (recharger included, >2 megapixels, smaller size, compact flash). After using it for a week, I was very pleased with it. The size makes it very convenient to carry around. It is very easy to use. The one-touch upload is a neat feature. Pictures on first impression are quite good.<br />However, as I play with the photos that it takes a little more, I do notice some image quality issues that I didn't notice originally. First, many pictures have a slightly greenish hue to them (more common in lower light situations), though this is not really a big problem. I find that using an editing software and backing off on the green slightly corrects the colors. The other image quality issue that I note is a little more bothersome. On close inspection of the images, many areas have slight \"noise\" in them consisting of reddish and greenish bands and spots. When zoomed out, they blend fine without any noticeable color problems. However, if you increase the color saturation in image editing software, they become very obvious. I found this to be a problem when getting prints made at Kits camera as the digital media photo printer that they use automatically increases saturation on the images before printing, which causes noticeable red and green artifacts/noise in the pictures.<br />Despite the image quality issues above, the price/size/convenience can't be beat.","I bought this camera despite all the posts regarding compatibility issues with Win98 and Adaptec EZ CD Creator.<br />I have both. Now, i didn't install NikonView because I have tons of good paint programs.<br />So when I plugged the camera into the USB port and turned it on, the computer detected it and asked for drivers. I got usb drivers from Nikon's technical support via email. Now when I plugin my camera, I see it as a removable drive on my computer and can move my pictures around freely.  FYI, Win2K and WinME detected the camera automatically and didn't need any drivers.<br />As for the camera itself, I love it.<br />The rechargeable batteries are great, the pictures look great and it's easy to take with you because of it's small size.<br />I went out of my price range because this was the first camera that had Everything I wanted.  Anything cheaper had something lacking.","I have used this camera for 3 weeks and it is excellent. Simple to use, good features for basic photography, excellent picture quality. I would recommend this camera to anyone who is interested in getting started in digital photography.<br />The one drawback is the software which accompanies the camera...the Nikon View 4 software is fine...it works well for me even with the Adaptec CD burner - but the bundled Cumulus software is a disaster. First, it crashed my system any time I tried to download images from the camera, and second, it's a demo version, so after a set number of downloads it forces you to upgrade. Load only the Nikonview 4.1 software. Shame on Nikon for bundling this garbage.<br />Bottom line - great camera, easy to use, great images.  Skip the Cumulus software.","This is the best digital camera I have ever used!<br />Picture quality: even in the lowest setting, these pictures are sharp and crisp.<br />Battery life: almost 80 pictures, all with flash, all with the screen on, and reviewed and deleted a few using the screen. Transferred them all to the computer, and the battery isn't even low. My old Kodak would have used 50 batteries under the same circumstances.<br />Features: For the price, in my opinion, this is the best value - feature for feature - of any digital camera available today.<br />Software: Nikon's transfer software is really easy to use. I was expecting it to be a little more difficult, but its quite easy. (I use Windows 2000-SP2). And transfer is fast and error-free.<br />I wouldn't hesitate to buy this camera again, and I would seriously look at Nikon for their other cameras also. The digital quality I see here is the same attention to deatil I have come to expect from Nikon's SLR/35mm cameras.<br />Buy it, and buy it now!","Good features for the price. Glass lens is a must, pictures are excellent. Not a top of line camera with 2.1 megapixel only, and no hot shoe & menu system could be more user friendly. One review said they heard clicking sound... this is normal and is the continuous auto-focus - you can turn it off, but you do not get the LCD, only the viewfinder if you disable it.  The software compatibility problem is a bummer (incompatible with Adaptec etc.), but it is simple enough to load pictures via a USB CF card reader. Small size/weight and clarity of pictures equal a winner for an on the go camera for snapshots.","very easy to handle, especially the quick start-up guide. Manual divided in quick reference section and very detailed application guide, easy to use but could use some editing. Camera handles easily, very light and compact. Too thick to fit into shirt pocket easily. 12 different camera settings to meet various situations. Excellent picture quality (Nikon experience pays off) even at lowest definition setting; this setting is good enough for email and allows more pictures to be taken. This is my first experience with digital photography, but it only took ten minutes (after the battery was charged) to get started. Can highly recommend it.","The camera is as good as advertized. I was out taking pictures and film clips right after it arrived. I advise getting at least a 64MB extra card with it. The 8MB that comes with it only holds about 15 pictures and you'll want a spare anyway. One major drawback. The Camera USB driver does not get along with my Dell Inspiron 5000 laptop. The only way to run it is to do a selective startup in MSCONFIG bypassing all of the programs. Tech support told me I had to reboot adding the progreams one at a time until I found the problem one or ones! I have yet to find the right one. It also appears to interfer with the computer power-save mode. So far the camera is worth doing a special start-up to down load my pictures.","The camera works great! It's easy to use, the layout is straight forward and intuitive, and it takes great pictures. However, I ran into problems when I tried to install the software and upload my pictures to my PC. Every time I plugged in the USB connector to my camera, my PC would lock up and give me the blue screen of death (fatal exception error). I called Nikon tech support (1-800-NikonUX) and waited for about 15 minutes. When I finally talked to a support person, I described the error. He asked if I had Microsoft Windows Media Player or Adaptec Easy CD Creator installed on my PC (both of which are fairly common applications). I told him that I had both of them loaded on my PC. He replied, \"Sorry, your Nikon camera doesn't work with these applications. We're currently working on a fix for this problem and will contact you when we have a solution.\" I asked him if removing the applications would allow me to upload the images. He replied, \"We do not recommend removing any applications.\" I then asked him what good my camera is if I can't download the images to my PC. He replied, \"I can see where you're coming from.\" Needless to say, I was very frustrated. Basically, the camera works great, but you can't download the images to your PC unless you delete some fairly common software.","Camera seem to works fine,but I keep hearing a clicking sound from the lens. I'm not sure if this is a defect or it is normal.","I just bought this camera and I LOVE it!!!!!!  Its compact for travel which I plan to use it for in Oct, and it is simple to use...Transfering the pics to my computer is a piece of cake, I LOVE the world of USB!!! PS: get a extra battery pack, I am having way to much fun with this because it is new, and I have had to recharge twice already...I think when the new-ness wears a bit, I most likely won't need it.<br />Treat yourself... FYI, this is coming from a womans point of view (TB)","Purchased Nikon Coolpix 775 (NC775) two days ago after EXTENSIVE research on what would be the best \"first\" digital camera to buy. I am an avid photo taker mostly for scrapbooking purposes.  The NC775 appeared to have the best reviews as well as the best features for the money for a first time user.  Encountered a major problem, though, in transferring the pictures from the camera to the computer.<br />  The software has a fatal flaw if loaded onto a computer that also has the CD burner software \"Adeptec Easy CD Creator.\"  After 10 hours of wrestling with the software and camera, I called the 1-800 number; and a very nice gentleman worked with me for about 10 minutes before analyzing what was happening.  He asked me if I had a CD burner; and to my answer of yes, he asked if I used the software Easy CD Creator.  When I said yes to that, he told me about the conflict.  It turns out that even if I removed the Easy CD Creator software there would still be residual files left over that would crash the program.  The Nikon engineers are working on fixing it and they would send me an e-mail notice when there was a fix.  In the meantime he said I might think about getting a \"Memory Card Reader\"; but although that would be a stopgap solution, I don't want to spend this kind of money for a camera that has one fatal flaw.  I don't know what other problems might crop up after the time period expired for getting a refund.  He also suggested that the Nikon Coolpix 880 could be a good match for me.  I'll have to research that.<br />  It seems, also, that the NC775 is the only camera in the Nikon line that has this particular software incompatibility problem.  This major problem should be in a warning to buyers--especially first time buyers of a digital.  The camera is promoted as being an ideal fit for these novice users.  If I had mail-ordered it over the Internet instead of going to a local retailer, I would have had twice the frustration of returning it.  Because the service technician was so nice and straight forward with me, I am very inclined to go with Nikon again since I know that they won't give me the runaround like so many service technicians do (and we have all had that kind of experience).  When I called the 1-800 number I was connected to a technician within a minute of  the first ring.  That impressed me even more.<br />I gave it 3 stars because regardless of the software problems, I was impressed with the camera features.  If all had gone well, I might have been a 5-star customer.  I really am going to check out the Nikon Coolpix 880.","The choice of digital cameras are evolving.  They will become more and more specialized.  This is a good multipurpose everday camera.  It is very small, lightwieght, two mega-pixel camera that met my requirements for my photographic needs.  I wanted at least two megapixels, small enough to fit in a pocket, optical zoom, macro capable without extra lenses, compact flash memory, and a widely available battery. There were important to me because (1) my first camera Kodak DC 290 shot very good pictures for my needs at that pixel range (2) I wanted something smaller (3) optical zoom because I can do digital zoom back on the computer so who needs the camera to do it (4) compact flash because its faster and cheaper, and Sony didn't learn from betamax and created another format error, memory sticks (5) I don't like it when a company sticks the consumer 80 to 100 bucks for 'special' batteries for a camera (see Cannon Elph).  This narrowed the list down to just a few cameras.  This one just felt the best in my hand.  Takes great shots, has a self closing lens cap (a nice bonus).  A great everyday camera. Although you can't buy batteries at the gas station or quick mart; it uses a veyr common camera battery available at photoshops, drug stores, and discount retail outlets.  It comes with one set of rechargables, but its nice to be able to afford inexpensive backups for special events and travel.","I received the Nikon 775 a few days ago and not only is it the cutest camera I have ever seen but it also takes great pictures.  This is my first digital camera and I am very pleasantly surprised at the quality and ease with which it takes pictures.  Despite the camera's small size, it is very comfortable to hold due to its thickness.  I took several pictures in very low lighting, where I couldn't even see what I was taking a picture of on the LCD screen, but the pictures came out great!  Bright and crisp.  What I mostly love about this camera is the fact that it is so easy to use, you just point and shoot and the camera does all the work for you.  Then you just connect it to your computer and you can instantly see all the pictures on the screen.  I think this is a great camera for people who just want to take great pictures fast, anywhere and at any time, and not be bothered with time-consuming adjustments. I highly recommend it!","The camera is great, it's compact and has a lot of bang for the buck.  I only have one disappointment and that's why I gave it 4 stars, and that is with the Nikon View 4 software that comes with the camera to allow you to transfer your files.  I loaded the files exactly how they instruct.  And well, nothing worked.  I called Tech support and got from them that it is a conflict between my Adaptec CDR-W drivers and the camera drivers and that they are working on the problem.  In the mean time the 8MB card provided with the camera is full and I have no way to transfer the photos without purchasing a CF reader.  I've been trying to get Nikon Customer Service to help out in this matter and have had no luck.  I love the camera, and have gone out and purchased the reader, but Nikon's customer service needs help!  It's a good thing Nikon makes a very good product most of the time, I've been buying Nikon for 30 years with no need for customer service.  Hopefully they will still come through.","For a point-n-shoot, this is very cool.  I shot about 70 pics just playing around with it a couple of hours last night.  It is very capable, and the images are very sharp.  Although you can't set aperture and shutter speeds manually, there are plenty of ways to control your images through custom white balance, flash, and exposure compensation features.  The manual is also very well written and easy to understand.  There are two reasons why I don't give it 5 stars: 1)Custom settings are not saved if you turn the camera off.  Once you switch it back on, everything is set back to default settings, and many of these custom settings are only accessible through the menus (although they are very easy to navigate).  2)You cannot mannually set white balance, flash, or exposure compnesation if you are in one of the scene modes.  You can accomplish what you want in auto mode where you can get to these settings, but it would be quicker to dial in a scene mode then be able to change just one setting (i.e. flash).  All in all, though, this in an excellent buy for a family point-n-shoot digital camera.  One thing, you had better buy a bigger memory card - the 8mb card that is included just won't do it if you're shooting at the highest resolution.  I suggest 96mb or higher.  This will give you capacity for 99 images at the highest resolution, best quality setting.","For a point-n-shoot, this is very cool.

The flash is very powerful and it can even record little 15 second movies. There is just a lot this camera can do. Plus it comes with a battery and charger and you can't beat that for the price. (although I paid only $400 for it). anyways, hope this helps, I've extremely happy with this camera.","This camera is deceptively small ...but don't be fooled it takes awesome shots and is easy enough for my 7 year old to use...as Paul Simon once sang \"I got a Nikon camera. Love to take those photographs...\"","I got into digital cameras through the Coolpix 990 (and recently upgraded to the 995).  I love the power and flexibility of those top-of-the-line Coolpix cameras, but they weren't portable enough to make the cut for parties, light travel, and similar situations.  From the start, I was evaluating this as a second camera: I have the 3-megapixel 995 for high-quality \"composed\" shots, and wanted a less expensive, \"fun\" camera for casual, everyday use.  I was about to buy the Canon S110, but decided to wait for Nikon's 775 release, and I'm glad I did.<br />As a 995 user, I can use the same batteries and NikonView software with both cameras (unfortunately, the USB cable is slightly different to prevent people from trying the MC-EU1 remote cord on the 775).  This fall, Nikon is even releasing the UR-E3 converter that will allow use of the 950/990/995's Wide-Angle and 2x Tele lenses!<br />Compatability aside, the 775 is a winner in it's own right.  I really appreciate the 3x optical zoom (vs. 2x in the Canon S110), and the scene modes allow even greater refining of the quite-capable \"auto\" setting.  You can get creative without delving into the world of manual settings -- great for first-time users, yet still offering something new and useful to the experienced digital photographer.  As you would expect, Nikon delivers on its reputation for high-quality optics and great pictures, even from its 2-megapixels.  The \"macro\" close-ups are unbelievable (the Canon doesn't even come close).  Think mini-950.<br />The only area where the Canon beats the 775 is size -- the Nikon is a good deal thicker front-to-back (I could put the Elph in a shirt pocket, but the 775 just won't fit).  I figure it's a small price to pay for a 3x zoom.  I would have given the 775 \"Five Stars,\" but knocked one off for the construction.  The casing is plastic and, despite its high quality, makes the camera feel like it's \"cheap\" (compared to the aluminum S110, although the 775 is much lighter).  Even if it feels inexpensive, the proof is in the pictures.  The performance has been flawless; we'll see if durability is an issue over time, but I've got no basis for concern.<br />For point-and-shoot convenience and portability, with the quality one would expect from Nikon, the 775 is a most worthy addition to the Coolpix line.","Ok so I bought this camera when it first came out and wrote a quick review of my opinions after a week.. I was absolutely RAVING.  Thousands of pictures and some 5 months later I rereview the camera as I promised way back.  This camera is a great camera for getting your foot in the door of photography.  It has some great features that other cameras in its class don't have and gets you craving for more.<br />Nikon - on the plus side.<br />1.)  Really good picture, my opinion is that the picture is the best in its class.  For close ups in well lit areas its absolutely amazing.<br />2.)  Price, I'm not really sure whats in its class since its really relatively cheap.<br />3.) For the price it has a lot of well implemented features.  These features come in handy when months down the line you suddenly feel like you want to be a power user.  For example increasing exposure and playing with the white balance creates some really natural looking colors in low light.<br /><br />Down side<br />1.)  The firmware seems to have some bugs.  Settings don't seem to persist through battery charges which is really annoying.  It used to work<br />2.) AUTOFOCUS WHEN THE LCD IS OFF DOESN'T WORK.  God I hope someone at nikon is working on these two bugs.<br />3.) Compared to other cameras with similar specs it is just a little bit on the slow side.<br />4.) Need an autofocus light for use at night!  Canon has it why don't you.<br />Conclusion:  Even with all my complaints I still maintain that this is a great camera.  The price is incredible.  Depending on what your looking for in a camera the nikon might not be for you however.  If you are looking to just point and click and aren't too worried about the artistic value of your picture maybe look into the canon s110.  Its smaller, doesn't have bugs, and built sturdier.  If you have a bit of the artist in you and don't mind a little hassle at times, go for the nikon.  Now if Nikon fixes these two bugs I would say there was no contest, so get on it someone.","The Coolpix 775 is geared toward the casual photographer that is looking for convenience and compactness in a digital camera. The camera is light and tiny but still very comfortable to hold with the built in grip on the side of the camera (unlike Canon's Elph cameras).  The 3x zoom range on the lens is unheard of in a camera this small!<br />What sets the camera apart is Nikon's exposure metering system and the scene modes.  It uses Nikon's renowned sophisticated metering system to get the perfect exposure for nearly every shot.  In addition, it has seven scene modes for common situations where the metering may be fooled (backlight, landscape, beach/snow, sunset, portrait, party/indoor, and night portraits).  This is great for the novice that doesn't want to mess around with complicated manual exposure adjustments.<br />The 2-megapixel CCD is plenty for getting great 8x10 prints.  You'll want to purchase a larger compactflash card because the included 8 MB card will definitely be too small to take more than 15 photos at the highest quality and resolution.<br />It comes with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and battery charger which many other digital cameras in this price range leave out.<br />Compared to the Canon cameras I have used, the colors are much more natural, especially for skin tones.  The Nikons seem to go for the more natural colors as opposed to many cameras that go for more saturated and punchy colors<br />If you're looking for a camera with a ton of manual features (saturation control, aperture and shutter priority, full manual control, etc.) then you need to step up to the Coolpix 995, which costs twice as much.<br />I would definitely recommend the camera to the user that is looking for a great, easy-to-use, point and shoot digital camera  that takes awesome photos for printing up to 8x10 photos or just digital photos to share."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 995","amazon_reviews":["great","Luckily this camera works and I am enjoying a photo-taking renaisance","Does a wonderful job for a 13 year old camera","Great camera, very happy with purchase!!

But over the past 18 months it has been flawless, and made me switch completely to digital for family and some work (dentist).<br />I thought it interesting that someone noted that red eye was not as much of a problem as earlier Nikon digital cameras - I thought it was a big problem, and it would be my one complaint about the 995.<br />The 3.2MP was more then sufficient, I recently just got an 8 X 10\" from an online printing surface, and it is beautiful.  Printing on my HP 7550 I was able to get excellent 5\" X 7\"'s, but I guess this isn't a printer review.<br />The menus are easy, and downloading via USB was a snap.  I would rate the software as very average.  I still don't understand why WIN XP can't just recognize the camera for direct downloading instead of going through a third party soft ware.<br />I have now attached the camera to a clinical microscope and will continue to use it.  And I don't think I will buy anything more then a 4MP camera for my next hobby camera.  Of course, I just purchased the 6.2 Canon Rebel today for work and serious photograpy, but that's another story...","I received this camera as a gift 2 years ago.<br />I sell gemstones and jewelry and it was very important that I could get a camera that took good closeup pictures.  This camera never let me down!<br />It is also great for everyday pics of the family or vacation shots but it met and exceeded my needs for the up close images I needed.<br />Thanks Nikon for an awesome camera!  :-)","I have always enjoyed using Nikon camera's.  I recently Switched to the digital from the 35mm after some extensive questions regarding the cost of and usefullnes of the digital.  I found that the Coolpix 995 was as flexable as any of my 35mm's. I have taken an image up to 11x14 and was real impressed with the resolution of the 995 in comparison to the 35mm Nikon loaded with asa 100 film. Ya can't go wrong with this camera, \"Hurray\" for the Nikon company...you've done it again, Thanks!","I bought my Coolpix 995 almost a year ago and can finally say that I<br />have used, and feel comfortable with all it's capabilities. This is not just a point and shoot camera, although it can be used that way with excellent results. In difficult situations one is able to control everything from exposure to focus, and easily confirm that the result is what you hoped for. I have been taking photos for 30 (yes thirty) years and graduated from the darkroom to digital with anticipation. I was not disappointed. I have used this camera to convert slides and negatives to digital format with excellent results. The built in flash is good for many situations and you can fiddle with the settings to extend it's range, but an accessory bracket will allow you to use your old flash unit to extend it even more.<br />The accessories I would recommend are the flash bracket, Nikon's wide angle adapter, at least 1 128 Meg flash card and an extra battery. I have filled a 128 meg flash card (about 120 pictures at  the full/fine setting) using the monitor and built in flash for each and still had power to review them. I had another battery and flash card and that shoot netted me over 200 images of a local band for their web site.<br />I haven't touched my \"analog\" cameras since buying this one and have not looked back with any regrets, except that digital capabilities didn't come sooner.","I have owned this camera for almost 16 months now and have shot over 4,600 photos with it! To say I love it is an understatement. I have been doing photography seriously for over 40 years and waited quite a while before getting a digital camera.<br />This camera has not only not disappointed me, it has performed beyond my hopes for a digital camera. The many choices of settings enable me to capture most any photo I attempt, from very low light (by using the 800 ASA setting) or on Slow Sync with a Tripod allowing the camera to decide the settings...or by using shutter priority to capture motion or aperture priority for amazing portraits.  There are many, many settings to choose from, and learning how to operate everything takes some time.  Read the owner's manual several times, and keep it handy to refer to as you are learning the camera.  Well worth the effort!<br />The pop-up flash does a good job, within the distance that Nikon recommends. With any flash on any camera, it is necessary to pay attention to the recommended distance for use.<br />I also get a lot of fun out of the swivel function of the lens. It is great fun to pull a friend close, hold the camera out at arm's length pointing it back at ourselves and watch in the monitor and take the photo.<br />And holding it is a joy. It's large enough to be able to hold it with both hands, thereby making it very easy to hold still...but it's not overly large. It feels solid and strong and functions like a real camera, not a toy!  I have looked at some of the newer Nikons since this came out, and they don't seem as well built...too much plastic.<br />Let me mention that one of the specs listed here is wrong. It has 3.34 megapixels, NOT 3.2 megapixels.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone who values good photography!","It just so flexible and let me shoot from any angle I want, control is hard to learned and seems complicated at first but after all it's just great.<br />Macro mode delivers the nice crip details.  I equips it with the nikon wide converter wc-e24 0.66x and found the good combination on it.  Like 990 modle, the 995 give me the solid feels when hold it and the grip is well designed so it fits well with my hand.<br />The camera does require some few secounds to turned on and focus, but it doesn't bad compared with its quality.  I don't like the way nikon use the proprietary battery for this model so I ended up buying the ... external battery for [$$]and it can go for 2-3 hours with mornitor on (2-3 times longer than the internal one)...  Love it.","Got the Nikon 995 from ... in Jan 2002 - and have taken around 2000 pictures till now. I have been very pleased with its performance as a digital camera. The freedom to click on whatever I like to shoot knowing that it costs nothing - has been the best part. I just have a 32MB card, but in the decent resolution that I use, I can take around 140 pictures or so before I have to reformat.<br />Pros:<br />* Excellent picture quality<br />* Swivel lens - lets you shoot at angles without spraining your neck<br />* Drag & Drop download to PC - it's a breeze.<br />* Decent battery life and quick recharger.<br />* Flexible manual controls - aperture, shutter speed etc.<br />* User friendly controls - right where you would expect them to be.<br />* Smooth zoom<br />Cons:<br />* Long Delay between click and shutter release - I lost some precious moments because of this delay - and now I usually click before an event - hoping I would get it at the right second.<br />* Too many steps before I can shoot (Pull out of bag,Remove lens cap, Switch power on, Turn swivel, Popup flash and then - wait for the camera to get ready...)<br />* The lens cap that unprofessionally hangs off a thread<br />* Poor video capability - but thats what camcoders are for.","The Coolpix 995 has an excellent quality lens. Very realistic colors, with no-extra vivid touch, as I am used from Sony and Fujifilm.<br />This Nikon Coolpix-995 camera is a little bulky & heavy to carry but this brings the advantage of stability in shooting. Handy and functional, easy access to controls.<br />With wide converter the barrel is quite well corrected, comparative with the wonderful Canon lens 2.8/24mm, and far better than Fujifilm 4700 without any wide converter.<br />Poor pictures with the flash in dime light as all cameras with buil-in flash. With SB-80DX becomes a very powerful tool, quick in focusing, precise in exposure metering, with no room for failure - a real professional camera. Mounted on the SK900 bracket you have a nice feel of a trusty tool in your hands. If you attached the wide converter to the Coolpix-995, and you mount it on the SK900 bracket together with the flash SB-80DX, you can put it on the table with no concern that the lens is in danger of scratches or everything to fell apart or to fell down.<br />The 2 batteries are sufficient for a one day trip.<br />The 1GB memory is enough to carry a laptop with you for a one week trip.<br />I never needed a tele-converter.<br />The lens' zoom and the wide converter provided what I needed in the past 60 days since I brought the camera.<br />In automatic focusing a continuous lens-noise is stopped only by the stand-by function.<br />The camera wakeups pretty slowly to my taste.<br />The manual is not very easy to digest, but this is the only way to get the maximum from this camera.<br />The optical viewfinder has an important parallax to correct.<br />I would prefer a digital one instead of the optical and LCD swivel monitor.<br />Bracketing function is obsolete when using the SB-80DX flash.<br />USB was functioning from the first camera connection with laptop. Microsoft XP Professional did not produce any problems when the photos were turned from landscape to portrait in Explorer.<br />Remarks: I would prefer a camera with 24-120 or even better 24-192 zoom lens (in 35 mm equivalent). The time lag I would prefer to be minimized and a hotshoe for flash would be great. A color digital viewfinder it is a wish....<br />Now I am seriously thinking to look for a 5 megapixels camera that will cover my desires and expectations. I am thinking to Coolpix 5700, which will allow me to use the accessories I have.","I paid only $[money] after rebate for my camera.  I am thoroughly pleased with it.  I have made hundreds of pictures and have had great results.  It does have a complicated menu but that is due to it's extensive feature set.  I have been buying 128MB Compactflash cards for about $[money] at a local electronics supplier and they have been completely satisfactory.<br />The only annoyance with the camera is the size and weight of the wide angle adapter and the fact that the flash and viewfinder cannot be used when it is installed.  I will have to buy a flash bracket and an external flash to be able to use a flash with the wide angle adapter.","I'm very pleased with the camera, and I believe it was offered at a great price... This is the third Nikon I've owned, but this is my first digital camera.  Previous to it, I scanned negatives and slides into my computer.  My main concern was picture quality.  The Coolpix 995 makes excellent 8x10s.  Unless you look very carefully, it's difficult to distinguish them from prints made from Nikon's more expensive cameras, such as the Coolpix 5000.  The 995 also works with Nikon speedlights, including the SB24, which I have.  To me, this is an important feature in that it allows for the use of the flash off the camera.<br />I strongly recommend buying the SK-E900 flash bracket.  I found that I could not mount the camera on my Stroboframe bracket because of the shortness of the sych cord (AS-E900) and the location of the synch terminal on the camera.<br />The only downsides I've discovered, apart from the location of the synch terminal, concern the fact that the 995 is more bulky than I wanted.  Some of the menus are confusing, as well.  The 995 does have a \"point and shoot mode,\" but in truth, this is a camera for someone who really understands photography and who is interested in customizing a host of camera functions.","The 995 is a very good camera for the average shooter.  It has the ability to change angles for difficult shots, such as over the heads of croud.  Resolution is as much as anyone would want for 8 X 10 blow-ups or less.  The battery is hard to find.  Nikon, the company, is not very helpful and sometimes even rude.  The view finder makes it difficult to make closeup pictures in bright light and the automatic focus works great on large items.  Almost impossible to take pictures of lacey items like delicate flowers cause it does not have enough to focus on.","I like the camera. Though it is not perfect. This is waht I do not like:<br />1. autofocus works well only in good light, if light is low<br />or if there is large contrast autofocus very often goes wrong,<br />it is much worse than my old Nikon N60. And this is not only<br />my unit - my brother's one has exactly the same problem<br />2. it is bulky<br />3. it drains batteries like crazy 200 shots (60-100 with flash) and battery is gone, you will need spare battery<br />4. close-ups have problems with focus. autofocus often fails<br />while manual one does not have enough steps,<br />however recently my brother is very succesfull with closeups -<br />I am not.<br />On the other hand there are things I love in this camera:<br />1. If focus is OK pictures are good quality - almost as good<br />as my Nikon N60 but for the computer screen it won't be any better<br />2. most of the photos are fine - I guess the light meaters<br />etc are good<br />3. I love the swivel thing - I can take photos like myself<br />with something in the background<br />4. It can take nice photos in low light with no flash.<br />You need a tripod but on the other hand you get much nicer<br />skin tones than with the flash. This is especially great for museums,<br />I have great shots of items with no tripod and no flashlight!! I Love this!!<br />5. I love the gadgets: computer connection is as fast as USB can<br />be (much faster than my USB reader), camera is seen as SCSI<br />driver on my Linux Red Hat box 7.2 with no extra drivers required. I love TV cable (both NTSC and PAL) so you can<br />go to you family and show the shots on their TV. The quality<br />of TV is not great but it is very convenient.<br />6. It uses CompactFlash - the best choice for memory:<br />cheapest(paid $[money] for 256MB), most durable<br />7. I love higher resolution modes (though I never need more than 2 megapixels) - instead of xeroxing the book in the library<br />- I just take shots of the pages I need. I save money and time<br />on xerox copies.<br />Overall this is a nice camera once you are carefull with<br />the focus...","I have used this camera for some months now. I have used it in several travels internationally as well. There is very little I can complain about.<br />Daylight pictures are amazing. Indoor pics are very good as well. Sometimes I need to use the manual white balance settings to get great pics, but then hey - isn't that why manual overrides exist. Overall, color accuracy is fantastic, sharpness is very good. Sometimes pictures turn out a bit soft, maybe that is something to do with my settings. The built in flash is extremely good.<br />The areas that could do with some improvement are a) the auto focusing speed and b) the quality of the included software (nikon view 4) e.g. it needs to start up automatically and not manually, it doesn't let you copy pictures back to the card.<br />I am very glad to have bought this one; at 3MP, I can think of very few reasons to \"upgrade\" this camera any time soon.","This is the best digital camera I have ever owned or tried. For the people that gave this camera a bad review, read the owners manual, so you can learn what this camera is capable of.<br />I was AMAZED!!!<br />Oh by the way, I own a Canon powershot G2, nice camera.<br />The 995 is BETTER.","I bought mine about 2 months ago and have had great results with it. It's not quite the quality of my 35mm or my medium format but I DO LOVE the ability to shoot and immediately download the images to the computer and print them out. I use the camera for composition and ideas and then return to the location and shoot the scene with my medium format. If you are shooting snapshots the 995 might be a bit overkill. You will probably never need most of the features. Although the color and picture quality are gorgeous!<br />DOWNSIDES: (1) Proprietary Batteries...if that baby goes dead while you're shooting you can't run to the jiffy mart to get more. (2) The cable release (well not quite a cable) is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive. Over [money]. Since I shoot at night a lot, this would be a great thing to have but I haven't budgeted the money after paying the almost [money] for the camera. (3) I wish it had a hot shoe, but alas you can rig up a flash bracket that will work fine. (So that one is petty) (4) Some slight haloing (sp?) especially in the magentas around lights at night on the HI setting. Although this might be my fault in the fact that it has a so-so learning curve. But I'm starting to figure it out. These halos completely disappear when you convert the image to B&W in Photoshop.<br />UPSIDE: (1)The great manual functions. You can over-ride everything and tweek the things you over-ride. (See Learning Curve comment above) (2) Easy to locate buttons in the dark. (3) Fast Shutter Speeds and really low (and high) fStops. (4) It seems to transfer the 10MB Tif Files extremely fast thru the cable that came with the camera. I wonder if a reader would even speed that up more??? (5) Hey it's a Nikon. They do make pretty good stuff.<br />In CLOSING: I looked at a few different models before getting the 995. I seemed to find the best quality and ease of use with the 995. My suggestion is DO NOT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT...go somewhere where you can hold and test this thing...(Obviously come back here to purchase it)...you will see the difference when you put comparable brands side by side with the 995.<br />cheers.","This camera simply takes great pictures, indoors and out, and great low-light pictures as well.<br />If you know nothing about cameras, just put the Auto Mode... You'll be dazzled with the results...<br />If you are a little more involved in the camera world... You will admit the camera is great...","I am new to digital cameras (though not to computers), and have used only simple film cameras.  I intended to purchase an entry-level digital camera, but my husband encouraged me to get something better.  We compared cameras, their features, and read reviews.  The Nikon 995 was our choice.  We ordered it six weeks ago from Amazon and are extremely pleased.  Right out of the box, it was a great simple point and shoot in auto mode for me.  As I learned more, I began using many of the options offered in auto mode. I joined an online camera group where I am learning about the manual settings, and I hope to eventually proceed to that mode.  This camera simply takes great pictures, indoors and out, and great low-light pictures as well. We live at the base of a steep hill and I take fantastic skyline and sunset pictures up there.  The photos transfer easily by the USB cable to the Nikon View 4 software on our computer.  I already owned Paint Shop Pro and I use that as my photo program.  Purchase a 128 MB memory card to go with it and perhaps an extra battery. The battery lasts a good while, but an extra battery is good insurance for those times you will be using the camera all day.  Also, buy a good camera case.  Don't be intimidated by articles that say this camera has a steep learning curve.  Auto mode is logical and simple enough for a beginner, and you have lots of choices to play with there or you can simply let the camera use the default settings.  If you don't want to go beyond that, you will still be very pleased with the photos you take.","I found a comment of Robert F. Hume is very useful for me. In the same situation of taking a shot of a tree with green leaves with a blue sky as a background and a sun behind, I saw a kind of \"grain\" along the line of leaves edge and the sky. The grain might be in horizontal or vertical direction and accumulates only in the connection line between the leaves and the \"blue\" sky (2048 x 1536, FINE). Sorry, this appearance does not happen to my Canon PowerShot S10!.<br />I originally thought that this is a defect on my camera (new) only, but now it seems to be normal for this model. Does anybody have this experience? I was even thinking about returning it.<br />Low light or flash phography were also terrible. Autofocus is slow at low light. Setting is complicated. However, its macro is superb! Outdoor photography with enough light is also great.<br />So, I give it 3 stars.","A couple of weeks ago I gave my new CoolPix 995 a five-star rating after very limited use.  Now, after a week of taking a lot of pictures I discovered some shortcomings:  (1) In only about a week I lost the cover cap for the auxiliary flash sync terminal, and since I had not even attempted another flash source I claim that the cap comes off 'way too easily.  (How do I obtain a replacement?)  (2) There's a lot of exposed glass on the outside of the camera that may be vulnerable to breakage.  (3) Too easy to misadjust the mode dial or turn it on or off inadvertently.  (4) Battery is adequate for simply taking pictures but lacks capacity as the sole source for transferring photos to the computer.<br />On the positive side, this camera takes pictures under low-light conditions very well even when I ignore its signaling me to use the flash, and I have nothing to complain about concerning the picture quality under any conditions.  In the \"point and shoot\" automatic mode the 995 compensates for my inadequate experience quite satisfactorily.","I may be a premature in assigning this 5-star rating but I think I'm going to love this camera as I become accustomed to it.  I've used an old Canon A-1 film camera for years and know my way around it quite well.  This Nikon, however, is my first digital camera and at present I'm awfully glad it has a point-and-shoot mode.  Seems to be capable of most anything I can imagine I want to take pictures of.","Light, practical, covers almost all needs of an user. Flip flash<br />responds well within 5 to 7 meters range.Perfect for near professional.If a card reader is used to rewiev the pictures ,Nikon 4 software is quite practical,but when it comes to create a new picture CD, your computer can get stuck,depending on the type of your card reader and CD recorder.<br />Camera has nothing to do with it, but it is a serious problem.","It took me only a few months to outgrow my previous digital camera. I was so happy with my HP315, that the Nikon was going to have alot to live up to. I still haven't figured it all out yet, but what I have is great. It's even more intuative than my HP. The features seem to go on forever. The zoom brings you right into the action. I only wish that I had more reason to use it on a regular basis.","Excellent auto mode as well as lots of room to grow if you wanna go manual. When I saw the results of my photography it inspired me to get to know my camera better. If this \"baby\" takes these nice pictures by itself, then what am I to expect next....perfection? Well, there's always room for improvement. In the case with this camera the improvement should come in the area of the \"photographer\", but the camera itself is a big time winner. ESPECIALLY, the price....","The CoolPix 995 is my 9th digital camera and the one that has convinced me to leave my 35mm SLR camera home when we take our next vacation (April 2002). I have been addicted to film for over 40 years but I am now officially converted. This will be the first time going digital only. I am still using film for underwater photography but that may change next year. The 8x10 and 11x14 prints I am getting from the 995 convinced me that digital is my future. This is one great camera, you can read the specs but using it is the clincher. If you buy it (Amazon's price is very attractive) get a spare battery and a 128mb (or larger) Compact Flash card and you are set. The Zio card reader is another nice accessory (but not essential).","I have owned 2 or three 35mm SLR cameras and based on<br />reputation, decided to go with the Nikon 995 for digital photography.  I could not be more pleased with this purchase.  Whether you point and shoot with the auto mode or<br />go for controlled effects with manual, this thing makes wonderful pictures.  The 995 has it all--the pixels, the zoom, the monitor, the close-ups, the convenience AND simple to use.  Like the camera, accessories are precision made albeit somewhat pricey, but hey--you're getting the quality of a Nikon.<br />Every conceivable option is available including telephoto<br />lense, wide-angle, fisheye, and assorted filters to name a few.  The camera design allows 360 degree vertical rotation so<br />one can look into the monitor AND shoot the photographer.<br />The location of the built-in flash reduces redeye over prior models. I have read a few reviews where someone had trouble loading onto their computer.  I am a computer neandrethal and this puppy was up and running in a few minutes without a single hassle.  Color is fantastic, but it helps to orchestrate your lighting for professional results.  I could go rambling on,<br />but let's keep it succinct, \"you get what you pay for\" has<br />never been more true than with the Nikon 995.","4.5 Stars<br />The price has come down recently on the 995, making it an even more attractive buy.  I do not own one, but have used one enough (8 or 10 hours) to get a good feel for what it can do.  And I've used it in very demanding conditions that stretched the flash and exposure controls to their limits.  Be prepared to work your way through the manual to learn all of the controls and do a little experimenting.  This camera has enough exposure and resolution control to satisfy most users even for many difficult situations.<br />Our work group has been testing digital cameras for years and in the process have had a good look at many Nikons.  We measure resolution in various ways to get a handle on effective pixel density over the full range of optical and digital zoom.  The 995 fared well in our tests, equaling the best comparably priced Olympus in all but the widest angle setting.  Some felt that the 995 could be optimized in exposure and color saturation even better than the Olympus cameras.<br />I spent a fair amount of time evaluating the wide angle converter lenses.  Near fisheye and wide adapters are available, as are telephoto.  In conditions not requiring a flash, the fisheye and wide adapters worked very well, introducing little distortion or reduction of resolution and color saturation was very good.  However, the 995's flash does not have adequate coverage for wide angle and fisheye images.  This problem is not unique to digital cameras - you'll have to get creative to use these adapter lenses indoors in close quarters.","Had a Kodak for just over a year, and while I really liked it, I wanted more expendability, ie, QUALITY LENSES!  I'm doing more and more 360 panoramic for web work, so picked up the CoolPix 995 and the 183 degree fisheye.  Really a great combo.  The camera has a menu of presets for specific lenses - two settings for the Fisheye.  Really fast and easy setup.  One caveat - MEMORY.  a 128 meg card fit a dozen photos in the Fisheye mode.  Same card in lowest quality (fine for web pics) holds a few hundred photos!<br />Camera has high speed modes, video mode, and more.  External sync for speedlights (bracket required).  Uses an oddball rechargeable battery, so you can't just toss in a couple of AA batteries as a backup. You'll need an extra battery or two.  Well worth the cost. Great camera, great quality photos!","This camera rocks!  Ive had it for a few weeks now and I love it.. Its very easy to use and has lots of fantastic options. The software that Nikon provides is awesome. If you have the money to get this I suggest that you get this.. This is a great camera!!!!!","A lot of people know a lot more about digital cameras than me. For those of you in the same boat expect a great product.  You will have to read the manual and learn the ins & outs of the camera, but what a fun journey it is. Spend time with it.  Experiment and you will be hooked.","This is really a wonderful digicam in almost every respect. The optics are Nikon-great, the optical zoom is an adequately powerful 4x, the resolution is good enough to make perfect 10\" x 14\" enlargements, and the rechargeable Lithium-ion battery system is a stellar performer both for its long life and for its fast recharge cycle. About the only things I don't like are the ungainly (unusual?) size and articulating shape and the lack of an adequate memory card, but there is no digicam available today that includes a card large enough to suit me.","WELL IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD A NIKON D-1 AND YOU ARE A CAMERA BUFF THEN THIS IN THE ONE FOR YOU. IT FEELS LIKE  A 35M IN YOUR HAND, OR CLOSE ENOUGH AND IF YOU ARE FAMILAR WITH THE NIKON CONTROLS THEN IT SHOULD BE EASIER<br />. THINGS TO NOTE:<br />IF YOU ARE NOT A PHOTOGRAPHY ETHUSIAST THEN FORGET THIS ONE, IT HAS A BIG LEARNING CURVE IF YOU WANT TO GET THE MOST OUT OF IT. THIS ALSO COMES WITH A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY AND THAT IS GOOD CAUSE YOU WILL NEED IT. I PLAN TO BUY  A COUPLE OF EXTRA BATTERIS. ALL IN ALL I AM VERY HAPPY....","Purchased this camera a month ago along with the wide angle and 3x telephoto lenses.  Nikon is known for their superior optics which this camera and lenses exemplify.  The only downer on the camera is that the lense zoom drive is a little noisy.  Also would have preferred commercially available batteries rather than propietary recharables.  Would also recommend getting a larger flash card (128M or better). On the positive side... and there is a very large positive side... this camera allows a novice like me to use it's sophisticated automatic features to produce excellent quality digital images.  It's compensation for poor lighting and automatic focus features are not to be believed.  Have used it for shots of models within 3 inches up to water falls across the valley with excellent results... even using the normal quality setting !  What makes it even better, is that you can delete your mistakes as you learn and as your ability improves, it has the functionalty needed by more experienced photographers.  This is the perfect digital camera for beginners having the desire to improve their photographic skills !","I bought the Coolpix 995 to shoot action pictures of BMX, snowboarding, skateboarding etc. Part of my decision was based on the extras that I was able to add to the camera, like different lenses and external flashes. I have added the fisheye wide-angle lense and the SB50 flash and necessary mounting bracket.<br />For regular, goof-proof shooting, the camera is excellent. The pictures are very clear with acurate colors and the main controls are quite simple. One annoyance, which is true for many auto focus cameras, is having to hold the shutter release button down half way to be able to take action shots - especially annoying when it's very cold and hands are numb. This holding down the button is necessary because otherwise the reaction time seems like forever between pressing and having the picture taken.<br />Once you add some options, however, things become a little more complicated. This complication is probably easily solved by reading the manuals a few times. things to note are: when using one of the optional lenses, the built in flash is useless because the lense is directly in its way. When using the fisheye lense you lose the ability to use the zoom (avoid this by not inputting that you are using a different lense in the option menu)<br />Overall, an excellent digital with more options and add ons than most others in this bargain price range. A little extra attention is required once the add ons are used.","I purchased this camera for my wife for christmas, and she just love's the pictures that the camera takes. we had a small problem at first on downloading pictures into our computer, however we got it working okey.  It's a great camera and we are very happy with the pictures that it takes. M.L.CARLSON.","I looked for a digital camera for a while until finally decided to get this one.  This is probably one of the best I can get for the money.<br />The camera is very easy to use, without looking through the manual I was able to take some good pictures.  The flash and focus indicators are very handy.  I can tell right away if I would need a flash and if the pictures are in focus.  Unlike many other digital cameras, it doesn¡¯t have any delay when the shutter is pressed which makes it easy to get pictures for moving objects. (I was able to capture several wonderful pictures with my cats fighting each other.)<br />The quality of the pictures is amazing.  I printed several 8x10s with a color printer, and they came out beautifully.  Not only the color was very real, but also it captured all the details you may and may not notice.  (I took some pictures of my 4-month old daughter, and I can see her slaver on the picture that I didn't notice while taking the pictures).  And I was only using XGA with normal compression.<br />Though the battery drains up fast, it is not as bad as I was expected and as seen with other DCs.  The process of loading pictures to computer is very easy and fast.  Many other features such as continues shooting, multiple screen, are nice and easy to use as well.<br />The only compliant one might have is that the movie clip doesn't come with sound.  But the movie is just a nice extra feature which I don¡¯t see as that important.  If you are in need of good movie features why not get a separate camcorder?<br />Over all, it is a great camera for both beginners, and almost-professionals.  I highly recommend it.","Oh the Debates in our household. - She wanted something cheap and cheerful - me having done photography for a living, wanted something I could control, a camera that wouldn't fight back. This was the the perfect solution. (Except that she wasn't so cheerful that it wasn't so cheap!)<br />A - Auto setting- a simple point and shoot<br />M - Manual in the loosest sense of the word gives access to the miriad functions and adjustments available.<br />I suspect that many of the problems other users have reported have come from not reading the instructions sufficiently, I still find myself refering back to it every so often to make sure there's something I've not missed. That said the manual control options are very straightforward if you already know ones f-stop from ones elbow...<br />Complaints that the 995 produces softer pics than the 990 arise I suspect, from the fact that the 990 automatically applies more sharpening in-camera. Enter the 995's menu and change its auto sharpening setting to max and the result is an image so sharp yer eyeballs bleed. personally I prefer to back off from crystal tip clarity and apply sharpening later with Photoshop if neccessary. At least the 995 allows control.<br />The same is also true with colour saturation. here I habitually adjust the 995 saturation to +1 which really brightens up our cooler British colours but there's also the option to go the other way- right back to black and white images.<br />Yes- Total manual control of aperture and shutter speed is impractically fiddly, however there is a very practical and effective workaround.<br />In P - program mode, adjusting the thumb dial cycles through the various combinations of Apperture/shutterspeed whilst maintaining correct exposure with its insurpassable matrix metering system. BUT if you want to adjust the estimated exposure, touch the function 2 button, It's right there, right between the thumb dial and the shutter release, just where you need it. Touch that and then use the thumb dial to exposure compensate + or - 2 stops. I find this way far easier than adjusting the Apperture and shutter independantly so I've no complaints.<br />Finally - the hotshoe issue. The Nikon speed flash is marvelous piece of kit and when I used to work with one it's TTL system NEVER let me down (much!). However at over 300 quid over here for the flash and another 90 just for the bracket!! tieing us soley into that system seems just a wee bit small minded and besides, I have a perfectly servicable Mecablitz CT45 already thankyou very much Mr Nikon san.<br />Here's how I use them together<br />Set the camera to aperture priority, and match its aperture to the flash's output setting. You can't connect the flashes lead directly to the nikon so instead connect it to a photo electric 'slave' sensor. My tiny slave has a sucker on it so I can stick it anywhere! Activate the cameras on board flash. position the slave so that it is triggerd either by the flash directly or by the flash reflected back from the subject. The slave sees the flash from the camera and triggers the CT45 which I bounce off the ceiling. Works a treat, well usually.<br />I love this camera, it comes everywhere with me. That's the final bonus, It clicks 'flat' and slips neatly into my jacket pocket.<br />Couldn't do THAT with my 35mm kit!","Strengths:<br />1. 4x optical zoom.  Most digicams in this price range only have 3x, and most lower-priced cameras only have a 2x or no zoom at all.<br />2. Pop-up flash.  Many owners of the Coolpix 990 and 950 have significant red-eye trouble.  Popping up the flash on the 995 gets it far enough away from the lens to eliminate most red-eye troubles.<br />3. High resolution.  3.3 megapixels in a quality camera like this is more than enough for most serious amateurs.  The only time this will become a limitation is if you want to make obscenely large prints (probably 16\" x 20\" or larger, and even then I don't think it would be a significant degradation) or if you want to crop significantly and make an 8\" x 10\" or something in that range.  I have been very pleased with my results, even in...<br />4. Auto mode.  The 995 has a steep learning curve if you want to really take advantage of its full feature set.  But its auto mode is intuitive enough that you can take the camera out of the box and start taking quality shots immediately.  The auto mode is no more complicated than any point-and-shoot camera.  Excellent feature.<br />Weaknesses:<br />1. 16 mb CompactFlash card.  This one is really a joke.  Nikon should have included at least a 32mb card and probably a 128.  I strongly suggest purchasing a larger CF card immediately.  Most CF cards have fallen to the 50 cents per meg range now (January 2002), so you should be able to get a good name-brand 128mb CF card for $60 or so.  Do it.  Now.<br />2. Digital zoom.  Worthless.  The pixellization is horrendous, and unless you have a huge amount of light the lens speed is such that you really need a tripod to avoid camera shake.<br />3. Lens speed.  With no zoom the aperture is f/2.6.  The further you zoom, the worse it gets.  If you don't have a tripod, I strongly suggest one (the 995's mount is sturdy and well-made, by the way).<br />4. No case included.  Again, something you definitely need.  I've had very good luck with LowePro, and they're reasonably priced.<br />5. Complicated menu system.  To take advantage of all the features of this excellent camera, you really need to spend significant time reading the manual and exploring the extensive menu system.  Not for the faint of heart.<br />I've given 4 out of 5 stars, with one star removed due to the above weaknesses.  But this is a fantastic camera.  I've had mine for only about three weeks and I've already taken more than 300 shots, many of them excellent.  I highly recommend it.","I bought this camera at the end of July 2001, just before a child's birthday.  At the end of the day, I uploaded the pictures to an online site because my printer had been on the blitz.  I also uploaded to my website so that my family could view the pictures.  Of all the pics taken that day, everyone was asking for copies of mine, so I had to order extras!  Since then, I have taken many pictures of still life, full motion, and everywhere in between, and they've all been wonderful. The color in the photos are so real, you'd never believe it was digital. Reds are red and burgundy is burgundy, no question.  The zoom is great, although I'm ready to step up to an optional zoom before next summer. If I had waited a little longer, I might would've gone with the Canon G2, as the G1 was no contest to this one.  That's the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, is because the G2 has a higher megapixel, although I like having a higher zoom even more.  I have produced great 8x10's out of this camera, so a higher megapixel for me isn't necessary at this time.  Oh, and 2 of my 5 dogs are camera shy and the swivel is great for sneeking shots in.  3 of the 5 are black, and if you've ever tried to photograph a black dog, you know how tough that is.  Well, even their pictures have turned out wonderful!  Overall, I love this camera and it's the best investment I could've made. I now have a new photo printer (Epson 785), and am falling in love with it all over again.","The Nikon Coolpix 995 box indicated compatibility with Windows 98. However, upon connecting the camera to the USB port, my Dell computer did not recognize it. The technical support was very difficult to obtain; almost took one hour each time I called and I had to call twice in one day. The technicians were very nice and after going through many checks concluded that the Intel Pentium II (r) 450 mHz chip and the Windows 98 did not work well with Nikon camera. They said Nikon was aware of the problem and was trying to work with Intel to solve it. The camera had to be returned. What a hastle ? Nikon should not try to sell a $ 1,000 camera with incompatibility with the computer. Also, the few shots I took and viewed on my television with HDTV capability did not look very sharp. The software provided was poor. My computer skills can be rated as better than average. I use word, powerpoint, on-line banking and so on. Therefore, the failure was not due to my computer naivette; even the technician with the Nikon agreed on that point. Until Nikon solves the compatibility problems and improves software, I recommend staying away from this expensive camera.","This is a very good, powerful and versatile camera, lots of creative control, stunning macro capability not matched by any other digital camera in any class. Menus can be a bit confusing at first, but once you're used to them, they don't see all that weird. Write speed to the CompactFlash card is quite good.<br />Use it in full auto mode, or switch to Manual mode where you have access to Program AE, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority or full Manual control. If you want a good camera for macros, this is it. Also, has a strong following among those who digiscope (attach a digital camera to a telescope or other optical instrument, such as a microscope), with many accessories available for this purpose.<br />Didn't give it 5 stars because the viewfinder like that of virtually all digital cameras, is a little small and uncomfortable to use. The LCD can be difficult to see in direct bright sunlight. Automatic White Balance never gets incandescent lighting right, but this is a common fault among many digital cameras. Lack of a low-light Auto Focus assist lamp means that focusing can be touch-and-go in very dim lighting. In dim lighting, the LCD can be difficult to use for composition of the shot.","I researched for months to find the perfect digital camera.  I was skeptical about all the reviews i had read, but opted for the Nikon 995.  I can't tell you how great it is.  I'm 17 years old and started a photography studio.  Any skepticism that my clients had about my abilities as a photographer went out the window once they saw how professional my prints looked.  Granted, this is in part due to a wonderful printer, but at the same time equal credit should be given to my Nikon.  The only problem that i've had is that the camera is soooo light that the hereditary hand tremor i have can sometimes make the prints blurry.  I've compensated for this by using a tripod for horizontal pics, but i haven't found a way to take verticle shots without sometimes affecting the picture. Overall, i am tremendously happy with my Nikon.  I HIGHLY recommend it.","As a retired professionaal photographer,I was amazed at the performance of this little digital. Ease of use coupled with outstanding qality in the finished product absolutely just can't be beat. Have used Nikon for over thirty years, but this one is the \"frosting\" on the cake.Nuff sed!","I have the 990 version of this and took it on location in Europe for 3 months in the dead of winter. I froze it, dropped it, banged it around, subjected it to some really lousy weather and it just kept on ticking. I don't care for the menu reading that has to be done when you are trying to do something a little different, but it's reliable as, well as reliable as a Nikon is supposed to be. The image clarity was better than I expected and we actually used some of the stills to cobble together a quick shot that the principal crew didn't get. It's now in the movie...","While I have been in computer graphics for many years, I have not taken the plunge into digital cameras until now.  I spent several weeks researching every camera out there...  The 4x zoom on the Nikon is not as good as the 10x ... but the digital zoom is quite amazing.  I was expecting to see a bad case of pixelation as I have seen on other cameras- but it is not apparent unless you extend the zoom to maximum.  The 3.1 MPixel is better than the 2 MPixel Olympus.  While I do not expect to use full resolution often (most of my pictures will be for computer viewing where 1024x756 resolution is more than adaquate) it will be nice to have it if necessary.  Unlike the Olympus, the Nikon comes with rechargable batteries.<br />Anyway, with all of that analysis behind me, I bought the Nikon and tested it out on vacation.<br />I added a 128 MB flashcard, set the camera to standard resolution and average compression and got 250 pictures on the card- just enough for the trip.<br />The camera is amazing.  With my limited photographic skills I still took great pictures.  The swivel design provides a great amount of flexibility.  I was able to hold the camera at waist level and still see the image.  This provided more stability and kept the images from blurring in low light conditions.<br />I played with using and not using the flash for indoor, outdoor, and night shots.  Night shots without flash were spectacular.  Most indoor shots were also possible without flash.  The camera automatically compensated for the existing lighting.<br />Since many shots were done of marine exibits behind glass, flash was not an option.  These shots all turned out well using natural and aquarium lighting.<br />Controls were easy to learn and became almost instinctive with just a few hours of use.  Showing others how to use the camera was simple.  I had several people take shots of my wife and I.  I would frame the shot and show the other people which button to press.  Instructing others was quite simple.<br />The zoom as mentioned before worked beautifully.  Several times I had to verify that I was in optical only zoom mode since the camera only has a short pause before the digital zoom kicks in when pressing the telephoto button.<br />In extremely bright light I found it more convenient to use the lens rather than the screen to view shots.  No big deal and framing did not present much of a problem.<br />The biggest point of confusion proved to be the auto shutoff of the display after a set period of time.  I increased my delay which has partially eliminated the difficulty. When the camera cuts off all you have to do is slightly depress the shutter and the camera \"wakes up\" in a few seconds.<br />While most of my work up to this point has been in auto mode, I have begun playing with manual mode.  The number of setting options that one has in manual mode is staggering.  Nikon has a user guide available from Amazon which I also purchased.  I got it and I am slowly working my way through the chapters.  The potential for the camera based on the user guide and what I have gathered so far is almost limitless.<br />In short, with the rebate, the camera cannot be beat for price vs features.  This camera will be all the camera I will need for several years and will definitely meet all my needs and wants!","We have owned a Coolpix 900 for about 3 years. Our friends bought<br />the 950 and we thought it had a lot of neat features that the 900<br />didn't have. But the 995 is even better. The new method for moving through the menus (a button with 4 arrows) was very intuitive and made it easier to move through the recorded photos in play mode. Also you can now instantly preview your last shot without having to go into Play mode. The camera has new features like a saturation setting which is pretty neat as sometimes I thought the 900 didn't capture the colors as vividly as they appeared in real life and I always had to edit them in Photoshop. And now you can save settings.<br />My only complaint has to do with accessories, or lack of them (like a case) and cost of additional supplies. And you will need another battery and bigger compact flash card. The 16MB card supplied with the camera is a little wimpy. Overall though, a great camera!","OK, if you can afford it, this _is_ the camera to buy. It's easy to use, it's fun, it's intuitive, it takes great pictures. Save up, buy this one.<br />First of all, notice the swivel design? This means that no matter how you hold the camera, you can see the LCD while you take the picture. Over your head, for when you are in a crowd. At knee level, for taking pictures of your grandchildren. Twisted backwards, you can take self portraits while seeing yourself on-screen (this makes for some very nice pictures!).<br />You can look at the camera in your lap, point it in any direction, and take pictures of people without their realizing it. No more rigid poses. No more uncomfortable expressions.<br />The 995 features incredible macro capabilities, allowing you to take pictures of flowers or rings (ebay time!) from under 2 inches away! The detail you'll se is amazing. It also features a 4x optical zoom (very nice, the 990 only went to 3x) and ISO up to 800, which is very rare with a digital camera. Evening photos are now a possibility without a flash.<br />About the only people who I would recomend not upgrading are people who already own the 990. The 995 is lighter than the 990, the flash is directly above the lense (the 990's flash was to one side, making shadows from the side), the flash is a pop-up, virually eliminating red-eye. The differences are small enough you can just wait till the next camera comes out to upgrade.<br />I would recomend saving  bit of money for accessories, though. A 100 meg memory card is very nice (1078 pics at lowest resolution, 7 at full TIFF), an AC adapter is handy, a card reader might be nice for long photo shoots. You won't need spare batteries, unless you are away from power for a very long time, the camera comes with rechargable lithium batteries (2 hours of life, with the LCD on! VERY nice), so you'll save money there. The batteries seem to charge very quickly, and will last even longer if you use the viewfinder instead of the LCD. Can fit optional lenses, but I haven't had a chance to play with that yet.<br />Let me give you a parting example. I took a picture of a silver ring. When I expanded it, I could see myself in the ring. I could read the 1 inch high words on my shirt. In real life, my reflection was about a millimeter high. You will LOVE this camera.<br />Indra","I have just migrated using classic NIKON F3 to Coolpix 995. I read, and read, and read until I tried to have several shots. I am so dissapointed after taking about 24 shots the 16MB Compact Flash has been fully occupied - Out OF Memory Message. Besides the case is not included and we have to buy AC Adapter separately. Unfortunately it is not available in my location . So my suggestion bigger CF maybe 128 MB, case and AC adapter included. Thanks it is great camera.","Yes, it is comfusing to use.<br />Yes, the accessories cost a lot.<br />Yes, it looks ugly.<br />Yes, is is still the best.<br />Yes, it is Nikon<br />Nikon's 995, came out when other companies came out with 4 megapixel cameras such as sony s5, canon g2, olympus 4040. It did not make sense to me, that company like nikon would fall behind to other cameras brands. however, when i looked at 995, i understood why they did it. because it matches up with other 4 megapixel cameras very well. nikon, one of the leading camera companies, came out with coolpix 995 after huge success of coolpix 990. it had great macro ability, awesome picture quality, and nicely built. coolpix 995, which is more like a upgrade version of 990, fixes some of the problems of 990, such as moving the flash to upward side, to prevent the problem that 990 had, by placing the light next to the lense. the zoom was improved to 4X, which is one of the best in 3 mega pixel class, (excluding that incredible olympus 2100 and stuff like that..) and it got a little smaller in size. now, nikon's pictures gives you incredible details and color. despite its slow lense, it captures enough light, not too satulated color, nice white balance, and, practically, everything.  macro feature is uncomparable, and huge selection of manuel features makes this camera the best of its class. 4 megapixel cameras in market right now (consumer models - not srls) uses similar size CCD for 4 megapixels, therefore, giving you more noise, not much better picture. and 995, it gives you the picture you want. thats why it competes with 4 megapixel cameras which is priced similar, same, or even less than 995. if you are a photo enthusiast, and want a camera that will satisfy you, get 995. you won't regret it.<br />if you are rich, or want something better from nikon you might wanna wait for 5 megapixel nikon coolpix 5000 which is coming out late november. oh, and the lenses from nikon - they are worth your money.","Don't get me wrong, this is a GREAT digicam. It's just that I'm not a great photographer. The camera works fine on the automatic setting but I keep feeling guilty about all the features I'm not using.<br />I would highly recommend it to the high end audience who really wants to tinker with the myriad different settings that are available. If you're new to digital cameras, I'd recommend something with fewer features at a lower price point.<br />All in all, I'm pretty happy. The quality of my photos is excellent, the battery life is good and... it's cool to own a Nikon!","I had the Coolpix 990 for 6 months then sold it to get this instead. The flash above the lens is an improvement. This camera is easy to use for a novice (had my boyfriend using this to photograph his Edward Gorey art collection) and multi-functioned for the advanced photographer - it lacks for nothing I could want.<br />I am a professional graphic designer (web and print). This camera has been INDISPENSIBLE! I am also a professional digital photo retoucher and can tell you that the images need little, if any correction for print.<br />I also bring this camera to the ad agency I work at and have used it for ads which have appeared in major magazines (Rosie, Family Circle, Marth Stewart Living .. etc.)<br />This camera is worth evey penney. What's more, tech support is available 24/7 via an 800 number - something rare these days. And their tech support people are really knowledgeable and patient.<br />If you buy additional flash memory, they recommend the Lexar 10X series. Anything less than 10x just won't keep up with this speedy little camera. I am hoping they will lab test the 12x series soon.<br />I couldn't recommend this camera highly enough. It will please you each and every time you go to use it! Way to go Nikon!","Outstanding features. A must have for digital photography enthusiasts.  Wish it had a hot shoe but you can't have everything.","This camera was ment to replace the 990, but that will never happen. The 990 was a much better and more solid camera. However since they discontinued making them, you wont get yoru hands on one for less than 1000 dollars, because of their high demand. The 995 flash, for one example is a pop up. It also feels like it is going to break off. The 990 was built all together and gave a great flash and a solid feel. This camera is OK. But if you would prefer a much more solid camera, go with the 990.","(1) The IBM Microdrive DOES work with the 995!  I've been using a 340MB drive and it works like a charm.  (2) The new positioning of the flash virtually eliminates redeye in most conditions, though the flash is still much weaker than an external one.  (3) It's a little annoying that a case was not included, the bundled compactflash is only 16MB, and you have to buy the AC cord separately.  (4) The auto-focus apparatus is a bit louder than other cameras that I've used, especially with \"continuous autofocus\" option on.  The optical zoom also seemed a bit loud.  They don't affect the operation of the camera though.  Also my hearing is particularly sensitive.<br />I am still learning the wealth of manual operation features that this camera has.  I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase!","I'm a novice photographer, but I upgraded from the 990 to the 995 and I love my new purchase! I am finding it superior to the 990. The quality of photos and ease of use make it perfect for my needs.","generally good camera. drawback includes slow lens, esp. on<br />the long end. also zooming is slow. pop-up flash could be<br />ineffective leading to overexposure and underexposure.<br />great macro performance, okay at normal distances. noise<br />reduction feature handy for long exposures. en-el1 rechagable<br />battery last pretty long. I got a spare battery and it's working great. no remote or<br />hot shoe to mount nikon flashes, The canon G2<br />might be an interesting choice.","I will start off by saying I've had a CoolPix 800 for 1.5 years and was very satisfied with it. However, as I progressed with learning photography, the camera did not allow me to do all I was wanting to do.  The 2x zoom got old having to deal with the teleconverter which did not allow a wide shot to be taken while on without a periscope effect.  The lack of settings control wore thin as I experimented with more advanced picture scenes. I decided to upgrade to the 995 with the 4x zoom being a big factor in my decision along with allowing more control.  I now had 4x zoom without my cumbersome teleconverter and could trick it to use my wide angle WITH the flash.  Note: That is with the old WC-E24 lens, not the WC-E63.  You'll still get a 'shadow' by trying to use the flash with the WC-E63 lens.  Here is what I've gained from my use thus far:<br />This camera is suited for those who want more control. Auto mode works pretty well for anyone just like my 800, but if you aren't going to take advantage of the Manual mode, you may be paying for too much camera. That being said, I had gotten used to my CP-800 doing most of the work. I was completely mortified in the beginning that my 'better' 995 was producing much softer, almost out-of-focus pictures. As others have mentioned, READ READ READ the manual. I'm still in the learning process of this camera since I do not take pictures every day. However, I have absorbed more knowledge of how to use this camera.  My pictures have now exceeded what I could do with the CP-800 after tweaking image sharpening, overriding shutter/aperture/etc settings, and turning continuous AF off. The latter reduces lag in taking pictures and stops most of that clicking noise the lens part makes (normal for this camera).<br />The camera has tons of features and it pays to check up on how to use them. ISO settings go up to 800, although the pictures genuinely turn up noisy (use noise reduction!). Try also 'bulb' (ISO 100) if you have a tripod and steady night subject - it'll turn out vastly better. The QuickTime inclusion was a nice bonus, but more of a gimmick.  This is no digital video camera. The new rechargeable battery is wonderful. I thought this would be bad, but with only one extra battery, I was able to shoot around 200 pictures with the second battery still going. Be sure to get the 8x or higher speed CF cards as the writing lag will drive you crazy on the old 4x ones.  The 16MB that comes with the camera is 8x. The new Quick Review is great to quickly see your picture while being able to still take another.  You can even zoom in on your pictures while reviewing them to get a better idea of what you got (or didn't get) in the picture.  The pop-up flash reduces red (and evil green cat/dog) eye while also allowing the WC-E24 to work (don't tell it that the lens is there and it'll work without a nasty shadow). There are many more resolution settings with a 3:2 setting for those wanting a 35mm-sized picture.  TIFF is available in 2048x1532 and 3:2 (2048x1360) for those 'perfect' shots.  I could go on and on about all of these features, but I'm limited in space :-). It's sufficient to say that most everything is selectable and it takes a while to get used to all of them.<br />The CP-995 is a great camera for those wanting more from a digital camera. Those wanting a quick, out-of-the-box camera may want to look to some of Nikon's less feature-filled cameras (CP-800 is highly recommended!)  The 995 really shines once you start to learn to use the features.  It will take some time to figure which settings work best, but the results are absolutely worthwhile.  Feel free to ask me any questions on the camera.","This is a great little camera. It is small, well constructed, easily transportable and feature-laden. With 3.34 mega pixels, its image quality revivals 35 mm; although I still think my high-end nikkor lenses and SLR are better. However, the image quality from this camera is quite good. Additionally, you can see the image after you take it. If unacceptable, you delete it and take it again. Gone are the days of finding out someone's eyes were closed at the moment the shutter snapped and the days of needing to take multiple pictures of the same thing to be sure that one good picture is obtained. The zoom is improved over the Coolpix 990, and its possible to zoom after you take the picture, so you can crop the image in the camera after it is obtained. The macro mode is particularly sharp and easy to use. By most reports, the pop up flash is insufficient and needs to be supplemented in instances where true flash is needed. However, the pop up flash has worked well for my needs (mostly \"snapshots\" of people.) In automatic mode, the camera will choose very slow shutter speeds at low light levels and objects suffer from motion blur. You need to use the pop up flash in situations where you would just be using faster film and no flash in an SLR. Although obvious, if you are accustomed to film, digital offers the distinct advantage that images are free once the camera is purchased. For the hobbyist, this aids creativity since you are able to take a lot of pictures and experiment, without being inhibited by having to pay for film or processing. There are some accessories you need, so the camera is more of an investment than merely the purchase price. You probably need to purchase a larger memory card than the one supplied. Although images can be stored on your computer, if you are taking a lot of pictures without access to your computer (i.e., if you are going on a long vacation), you may need multiple cards, or something called a digital wallet which allows thousands of images to be stored on a small, portable hard drive. Although these accessories are useful and easily available, they aren't cheap. My older digital camera did not nearly come close to being able to replace my film cameras. This one does. While my allegiance the film is hard to break, this is now my favorite camera. I highly recommend it.","I come from the background of using only fully manual SLR's like the F3 and have not adjusted that well to the 995. For one, getting used to autofocusing has been a challenge. Also, the manual's description of features is far from adequate. For instance, it's description of using bracketing is incorrect. When the camera is set on single shooting and in bracketing mode, you must shoot 3 or 5 separate pictures whereby each will be a bracket less than the last. This is far different then shooting with an SLR whereby it will three all three at one time. Also, autofocusing is not that fast nor that accurate. Being able to set the folder where to store the photos on the memory card is great. The upload software that comes with camera is quite nice and very simple.<br />My particular 995 lost it's ability to perform autosensitivity somehow and I have to get it repaired already. This otherwise would be a good feature whereby you don't have to select ISO 100 or 200 as the camera will do that for you. Too bad it does not work. Additionally, Nikon Digital support people don't seem to know the first thing about photography. I have call so many times to learn some of the features because their staff is not knowledgable about the cameras or about photography. Not to be confused with the film based division which are the finest tech support people in the industry.<br />In a nutshell, the 995 is a great camera that will blow you away with the results you will get. The healthy 35-152mm zoom lens is just great along with the many many features it has in it's menus. My wife has the Olympus 3030 which I find takes even more remarkable photos and is far easier to use. But, I bought the 995 and I'm gonna stick it out due to my tireless faith in Nikon. The batteries actually last longer than I thought they would. I bought 2 spare batteries so that I can cycle through them while on vacation. At a recent wedding, I shot about 120 pic's on one 96Mb card. That's very cool. Buy it, read the manual, read it again and again, and I think you'll be happy with the results.","I am hereby changing my review of this camera.  I use this camera on a daily basis at work (work is a camera store).  I originally gave it a 5-star review, but after comparing it to the Coolpix 990 (the predecessor to this camera, which I used to own) and playing with the new Canon G2, I have found myself highly unimpressed by the 995.<br />Maybe it's the fact that the 990 had a different lens (a 3x, the 995 has a 4x), I don't know.  I do know that the quality of the pictures is not nearly as good as those from the 990.  I liked the picture quality of the 990, but I sold it because I wanted several things it couldn't offer.  I wanted an on-board hot shoe, and I wanted a camera that had available accesories that didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Maybe I'm crazy, but paying more than a few dollars for a stupid cable to attach my flash to the camera seems absurd.  I sold the 990 before the 995 came out, and when it did come out, I was hoping for some changes, which if had been made might have convinced me to buy a 995.  Unfortunately, Nikon didn't make those changes.<br />The manual controls are still tricky and annoying to use (compared to the Canon G2's at least, which are laid out in a very easy to use and understand way).  Why Nikon insists on making manual control so convoluted is beyond me; it's completely unnecessary.  It's things like this that make people who are new to digital want to turn away from it.  Here is Nikon's method of manual control:<br />1.  Flip the power switch to \"M.\"<br />2.  Push in and hold the \"Mode\" button.<br />3.  While holding the \"Mode\" button, turn the control dial until the LCD screen displays the mode you wish (i.e. \"M\" for Manual).<br />4.  Let go of the \"Mode\" button.  Now when you turn the dial, your shutter speed changes.<br />5.  \"Oh, I want to change the aperture.\"  Press in the \"Mode\" button to switch to aperture.<br />6.  Turn the dial to change aperture.<br />7.  \"Oh, I want to change shutt -- oh, darn, my subject moved.  Too late.  Oh well.\"<br />Now, here's manual control on the Canon:<br />1.  Flip the control dial to \"M.\"<br />2.  Control pad on the back--up/down to control aperture, left/right to control shutter speed.  The Nikon 995 has a pad like this on the camera, why isn't it optimized for this use?<br />No on-board hot shoe for the flash.  Still no anti-glare coating on the screen; seeing the screen outside in the sun is impossible without sticking one of those annoying screen-hoods on it.  As for image quality, I find the that image quality isn't as good as the 990.  It's visibly less sharp than the 990.  I did some tests at the store, and the color correction is also pitiful.  I did a side-by-side comparison of the 995 and another high-end camera people often ask to see, the Canon G2.  I took the same pictures with both cameras using the same settings, and printed an 8x10\" from each.  The G2's color correction was far more accurate, plus the pictures were sharp from edge to edge.  The Nikon was sharp in the middle and fuzzy in the corners.  Even my coworkers, the majority of whom are Nikonians, agreed the the G2 took a much better picture.  Both cameras were set *exactly* the same (auto focus, auto white balance, timer exposure as to avoid camera shake, no flash).  And before you say, \"hey, you're comparing apples and oranges, 3 megapixel cameras and 4 megapixel cameras,\" keep in mind that a 3 megapixel camera is very well capable of producing a very sharp 10x15\" print (which I have printed from the original 990 model).  An 8x10\" should be no problem for a 3 megapixel camera, therefore, I feel it is fair to compare it to a camera of equal or higher resolution.<br />To top it all off, Nikon still refuses to bundle some decent software with their cameras.  Nikon View is awful.  For the price of the 995, they should at least bundle something like Adobe Photodeluxe.  Canon is generous enough to include copies of Adobe Photoshop LE with the G2.<br />In closing, I highly recommend you check out the Canon G2.  Nikon is coming out with a new model (the 5000) which is supposed to be much better than the 995, but if it were me buying it, I'd still stick with the G2 because overall I've been more impressed with Canon's line of digital cameras.  They must be doing something right--afterall, Nikon pretty much stole the G2's design for their new CP 5000 model, go see for yourself!","Gone are the days of the cheesy little novelty item digicam, with its whopping 640*480 resolution, ASA 60 equivalence and lens that does not compare favorably to a Koday Funsaver disposable.  This is the real thing.  A digital camera to satisfy photography enthusiasts.<br />This camera produces remarkable results at high resolutions.  It emulates ASA 100, 200, 400 and 800.  Has white-balance settings to satisfy most conditions, allows you to set your own if you want more accuracy.  Goes a reasonable distance on both sides of 50mm, at selectable F-stops in the F3-F10 range.  Aperature-priority, shutter-priority, programmable auto and full manual settings let you take control of what you want.<br />Two complaints:  the included 16mb card is a bit small for my tastes, but prices on those are falling.  (Amazon has a Viking 128mb card at [a good price]  And the shutter timer only works in macro focus mode and deselects itself after you use it, which can get annoying if you are taking a series of tripod shots.  But this is all minor, and does not change the fact that this is the only digital I've found that has made me hang up my Minolta SLR.","Simply put, the 995 Coolpix by Nikon is the best I have seen for a mid-priced camera.","I've been working with this camera for about 2 weeks now and all in all I really like it but....I can't stand the software. I'm shoot about 10,000 photos a year and usually use nikon products. I'm also relatively comfortable with routine computer use but I'm by no means an expert.<br />Its pretty easy to set it on automatic and take wonderful quality photos. Getting them onto the computer is not too bad using the nikon 4 software (once you  figure out the complicated order). The encorporated cumulus software and fractal software are really tough to load much less figure out. There really isn't much user friendly text included to help out. Nikon support was pretty good but with regards to much of the software all they can do is refer you to the software manufacturer.<br />Don't misunderstand, I really do like the camera.<br />You will however need extra memory and you'll probably end up buying the recargeable battery system as well. The price adds up pretty quickly.","I don't know what I can say about this camera that would convey how pleased I am.  I am an old school SLR fan that tried to resist the digital image craze.  After seeing some images that the 990 produced, I decieded it was time.  I have only had the camera for a week and I have shot over 300 photos.  I would strongly encourage you to get the largest memory card you can afford (Viking 256 mb is around $125)  You also should get another lithium ion battery.  I bought a 2x lense with it and I haven't really found the need yet.  Simple camera that easily lets you do everything manually or everything automatically.  It is a great learning tool since you can control one function at a time. I also bought the SanDisk memroy card reader, but I was never able to get it to work on my Win98 machine.  It works OK on my iMac.  I would suggest some type of memory card reader.  The cord with the camera is OK, but it limits your battery life.","This is an awsume camera.  It takes great pictures in both dark and sunlight.  Fantastic zoom, supports compact flash, Lithium Ion recharable battery.  Decent built in flash.  Great menu system, great manual.  I can't say enough good things about this camera.  You will not regret this purchase.","The photo quality from this camera is exceptional. 8 x 10 photos made look about equivalent to traditional 35mm photography. While the Nikons sometimes get reviewed as \"difficult\" to use, 30 minutes with the manual makes it clear how to access all of the different options on the camera, and a little experimentation leads to some very impressive results. This camera has the settings and flexibility of a high-end 35mm camera with several programmed modes and the ability to over-ride the programming. Flash photography with the built in small flash unit is exceptional. This is a truly first-rate product.","I just upgraded from the Nikon 990 to the 995. Right off the bat, I had to compare and see the improvement, and there is. This camera rocks. The 995 has an awesome 4X optical zoom (38 to 152mm eq.)and super macro capabilities, down to less than an inch. The colors and clarity are better and the focus locks right on.<br />This camera is great for the \"point & shooter\" on Automatic, or those who want full control, in Manual, over all the camera's functions. Add on lenses let you do wide angle or eXtreme zoom shots. You can even take full circle (spherical) pictures with the fisheye lens. Awseome versitility. Some even hook it up to telescopes by using lens adapters. The options are endless.<br />It comes with its own rechargeable Lithium battery and charger,and its fully charged in about 1.5 hours. Super turn-around.<br />I'm really glad I made the upgrade. My advise; Buy it!  You'll be pleased with your purchase."]},{"name":"Kodak DX3500","amazon_reviews":["Camera works perfectly and came with an unexpected bonus - a working battery!","this camera works every bit as good as the one I lost,  Actually this was an upgrade as this one has video and the one I lost didnt..

It is easy to operate and to load the pics into the camera, but as other reviewers have stated it uses a lot of power. The docking system seems to help to keep the batteries charged. A minor annoyance is that sometimes the shutter does not open when I turn on the camera. I give it a few good whacks with my hand and it will open. Not high tech, but it works. My friend's camera did the same thing and Kodak, with some prodding, fixed it for a modest fee.  My wife uses it for work and in general it is a rugged camera.  I may upgrade in the future, but for now I will keep it.","I bought this simple digital camera (sorry to say it, but...) with low expectations.

I did not purchase dock, and use Kodak rechargeable battery pack that came with accessory kit.  The Energizer blue and silver AA batteries also give dependable use.  I also used Kodak's customer service for advice and they were very helpful.","My husband received this camera free at a conference.  It sat in a cabinet for about six months.

I have printed 5 by 7's that are quite clear.","You can find images taken with the Kodak DX3500 at [...]<br />All of these images are unedited except for cropping. These were taken under the good quality setting (not even the best) during my vacation in august to the Smokie Mountains National Park.<br />This camera takes beautiful pictures, they absolutely stunned me and blew me away after my trip. It gave me truely memorable pictures for my vacation. I've also begun to use it to photograph my friend's and Washington, DC.<br />And I will also note, i have some photography experience but i AM NOT a expert. Simply an amateur who likes to take photos. Enjoy these representations of what this wonderful camera can do.","This is a nice \"point and shoot\" digital camera, with very good resolution. Don't get fooled into thinking that digital zoom means anything significant. It simply enlarges the image, and decreases the resolution.<br />Nevertheless, 2.2MP resolution is quite good enough for nearly everything you'll want to do. How often do you enlarge photos beyond 8X10\"? If you do that frequently, get a better camera. Otherwise for the current price, this is a very usable camera. Remember, the higher the resolution the larger the picture file. 2.2 MP is a very good compromise. You'll want a couple of 64 Meg or larger memory cards (Compact Flash).<br />The 3500 is light, and the pictures look great. Battery life is very good. Buy 4 additional NiMH batteries and a charger.<br />You will have to learn to use this camera however. You'll want to learn the menu structure, and the quirks of the camera. The flash is typical of such cameras, usable only for close snapshots. The optics are fine. It's fixed focus. The shutter speed is (probably) fixed and fairly slow - HOLD THE CAMERA STEADY! The manual simply says the exposure is \"automatic.\" Don't worry about the learning curve. Take your time. Erase the bad pictures - they're FREE!<br />This camera has been available for a while so you may want to look at the newer offerings. But then look at the current price of the 3500.","I'm pleasantly surprised how easy this camera is to use and considering the low price, the quality is outstanding.<br />This is my first digital camera so I wanted something simple, but decent, and cheap.<br />It takes great pics outdoors and the flash is all you need for wonderful indoor shots.","This is my first foray into the digital camera world, but I am SO glad I bought this camera! Although I bought it partly on price (it is last year's model, so I got a break), I am pleasantly surprised at the features and GREAT battery life (lithium batteries that come with the dock) it has. I went on vacation and took about 100 pictures (90% in the daylight) and the batteries were never recharged, and there was still battery life when I got home. I only used the screen five times to site the pictures, instead just siting them through the viewfinder. You need the screen to allow the digital zoom to work, because the camera doesn't have any optical zoom. From what I've heard - there are lenses that allow an optical zoom, but I haven't checked that out.<br />The software that comes with the camera is definitely up to the task for handling the pictures, but I decided to spend the few bucks and buy a separate program for classifying and editing the pictures. The 2.2 megapixels take a REALLY clear picture, and I've even blown a few of the pics up to double and triple size and the pictures still look great.<br />All in all - I rated this camera a 4 out of 5 only due to the lack of an optical zoom. The battery life is spectacular and the pictures are great!<br />A definite buy for the beginner!","This is a great camera for a amatuer photographer. I personally do web design, and needed something that would give me nice pictures without breaking my pocket, after several months of research i broke down and bought a refurbished Kodak DX 3500.<br />I will say I am immensely impressed, the camera is easy to use, takes wonderful pictures even on the lowest settings and allows me to take 40 pictures with just the internal memory. The digital zoom, tho everyone seems to complain works wonderful for up-close pictures, I mean like right ontop of the subject/object it definately removes the haziness you would normally get, but using it at distances cause it to blur which is normal for any digital zoom.<br />The tranfer to my Mac is absolutely simplistic, it took awhile for me to get all of the automatic stuff like the transfer utility and the web browser popping up on start up to go away. I don't recommend using the tranfer utility on a mac it always locked mine up, i have a 233mhz 128 meg first series iMac with OS 8.6. Instead i just let it mount the camera icon to my desktop then drag the pictures from the camera folder to where i want them and it transfers quickly and smoothly.<br />The camera itself feels a bit flimsy, but i wouldn't worry much, i'm hard on equipment and its managed to take the beating i've given it, even been dropped a couple times.<br />Another plus to this camera is that it takes GREAT night pictures, and works wonderfully if you are trying to get that artsy effect, i definately like being able to turn off the flash.<br />Now for my downsides, this is definately NOT a professional camera, don't expect it to be, you can't manually adjust the zoom, you can't manually do anything. Also the menus can be confusing until you figure them out or read the manual, it took me about 2 days to get it all down. Also the memory in the camera isn't much if you plan on a long trip, i advise a compact flash card, i've order a Viking one since they seem recommended for kodak for mine.<br />And the last downside is that the pictures on the LCD can be deceiving as to what they will look like. I advise only using the LCD, as you would for almost any type of camera with an LCD, just to make sure you got the area you wanted, don't trust color, brightness/darkness with it.<br />All in all this is a good camera, if you want professional be prepared to spend more, but if you want something to take good pictures, this is your camera, its easy, functional, a good design and takes wonderful pictures. Definately worth my money.","I got a DX3500 about a week ago, i purchased mine refurbished from the Amazon marketplace. I must say i love it, it has great pictures even at night and with low light without a flash, it allows me to do wonderful things artistically speaking. I wouldn't tho recommend this for a professional photographer, but for the amatuer this camera would be perfect. The images even on the lowest level are crisp and clear and the colors look beautiful.<br />For as much as everyone has complained about the digital zoom I've found it works well for close up objects it tends to make the picture a bit more crisp otherwise i wouldn't use it.<br />All in all, I have no gripes. The camera does what i want it to do, it fits nice in my hand, it does feel a bit fragile, but its plastic and not a really expensive camera. And transfering files on my macintosh is incredibly fast and easy to do, i don't even have to use the transfer software it links the camera as an item on my desktop and i can just drag and drop.<br />Again I highly recommend this item, but make sure you get a compact flash card as well, and they are much cheaper online then at a store. I got a 128MB card for $ on amazon instead of $ in the store.","I purchased this camera in late November of 2001, I had about 250 dollars to spend on one and this one looked pretty good.<br /><br />I was thrilled with this camera when I first got it, it seemed pretty good, I bought 2 extra memory cards, a flashcard reader and some rechargable batteries as well as a few other accessories to get me all set.<br />I took a walk around the neighborhood one afternoon with a friend and we took random pictures of whatever just to see how it works out.<br />First of all, the pictures with this are huge, being a 2MP camera, but like someone else said, there are only 2 settings and even with the 'good' quality the pictures are still pretty big.<br />Second, digital zoom is stupid. I didn't really know what this feature was at first, I thought it was just some kind of zoom on digital cameras that was actually useful, but as I found out, it was not.<br />When using digital zoom it just makes a total blur of what you think you are zooming in on.<br />The camera is pretty easy to operate, but it is a pain to keep changing settings for each picture you take, so there's another down side to it.<br />Like other people said, this camera seems quite flimsy, as in if you drop it it seems like it just might break. If not the camera itself, something inside at least.<br />Something else I noticed is that this camera isnt that great with its little viewfinder, I don't know. My pictures often come out with things cut off that I thought I was getting in the picture.<br />After a few months of having this camera I realized that it wasnt quite what I had wanted.<br />Also there is no way to add any zoom lenses to this camera so even if you buy it thinking you could get things like that for it, you can't.","Even though this is a beginner's camera, it is doing everything I want beautifully, except for the pretty useless digital zoom.  I use my Pentax rangefinder if I want to use zoom.  My Kodak DX3500 is a joy.  It's very easy to use, the software is excellent, the prints are beautiful (as you'd expect from Kodak).  I use it at least three times a week. I.E. I run outside to take a picture of a plant to send to my gardening e-mail buddy, download it, save it and e-mail it to her in about three minutes.  I can take 30 pictures of my granddaughter and have them ready to show to my daughter when she comes to pick up the baby.  I used a 64MB picture card for a trip to Arizona; I show those pics as slideshows on my family's and friend's TVs. I took a laptop computer on a month long trip to South Carolina, loaded the software on it, have all the photos saved on the hard drive; I took the laptop to my mother's nursing home to give her a slideshow.  I have NO complaints about this camera. I MIGHT buy a more high end camera in a few years, but I doubt it.","This was my first venture into the digital camera arena, so I wanted something easy with high resolution. This camera makes great clear pictures, but DON'T USE THE ZOOM. The digital zoom is always fuzzy. Next time, I will not buy without an optical zoom.<br />The camera dock is great! My wife and kids can use it with no problem. The extra memory is a must. If you take high quality pictures, the 8MB on board is just not sufficient.<br />Bottom line. If you want a good, easy to use, decent quality, reasonably priced digital camera without a zoom, this camera is for you.","I am so pleased with how well the pictures devolop.  I have had so many compliments from people on the quality.  So detailed.  Also the camera is easy to use.  The only problem is I can't get the battery to last very long.","I am not a professional photographer, but I feel like one when I use my Kodak DX 3500 camera and docking station. The docking station is a definite plus. I can easily upload the photos and then crop and/or make other changes with Kodak's software or with other computer software (presently MS PhotoDraw 2000 V2, but advancing to Adobe PhotoShop 7.0).<br />I also have the CompactFlash Memory Cards to take more photos at higher resolution while away from my computer. I haven't come across a portable battery charger for this camera (the batteries will quickly run low within a week), but I've taken the docking station and used it as a charger while away from my computer for an extended period of time (it doesn't charge the batteries on its own; it needs a 110 electrical outlet), but that seems to fill the need.<br />I'm sure there are more updated cameras since I bought this one this last year, but it still meets all of my needs very well.","I really love the camera because of its simplicity. But the dock that goes with it has some problems. i cant transfer the pictures and the camera disappears from the device manager.<br />When i called Kodak Support, they were mumbling so i couldnt hear them. Then, when i was finally transferred to Technical Support, the people kept on shouting at me.<br />Finally, I got it fixed, only to find out the same problem happened again.<br />Support Hours are only 5 days a week and its bad support.<br />I rated it 4 stars though since of its ease and simplicity. But i am not buying from Kodak again. Most likely, I'm going to go for an HP.","I've bought two camaras; Kodak's DX3500 and HP's 318.<br />DX3500<br />HP318<br />(at [a local store], 2/19/2002)<br />I feel the quality, ease of use, looks, ect. are about the same(or read more articles here for other opinions).  The only difference for me is that DX3500 does NOT accept regular alkaline-AA batteries while HP318 does. therefore, DX3500 will cost you extra money...<br />All up to your habit. If you take lots of pics weekly you may prefer DX3500 w/ dock. Or if you use it only twice per year(vacation) like myself, HP318 w/ regular AA's may be smart. I'd like to give 4 stars to DX3500, 4.1 stars to HP318.","I purchased a DX3500 after a week's ownership of an HP 318 that I returned. The DX3500 is an extremely capable camera that is easy to use for beginners and sophisticated users alike.<br />Compared to the HP 318, the DX3500 offers superior picture quality. Fine details are not lost in the 'grain' of the image. Colors are well balanced and smooth. Setup and operation are easy with the single function knob and easy to navigate menus displayed on the rear LCD.<br />One feature that should be mandatory on digital cameras is a lens cap or cover. This model has a lens shutter that turns off the camera when closed. In addition, there are guide lines on the viewfinder that show you where the edges of your picture will be so you don't cut off what you're trying to photograph.<br />Battery life is okay with alkalines although they aren't recommended for use with this camera because of the high drain. Kodak includes a Lithium Ion battery pack with this camera that provides a lot of use out of the box. Another plus is that this camera only requires two AA batteries as opposed to other units that require four.<br />The included software installed smoothly on Windows XP and when the camera is attached via the USB port, it shows up as a removable drive under the file manager. You can transfer files with either file manager or the Kodak software. Using the Kodak method is easier and allows you to automatically clear the camera when the pictures are downloaded.<br />I purchased two NiMH batteries and a charger for less than twenty dollars instead of buying the Kodak camera dock and rechargeable batteries. The dock simplifies image transfer and would be useful if you're doing a lot of picture-taking. It can also charge Kodak batteries when your camera is docked.<br />At medium resolution, the camera's internal memory stores 48 images. That supports 5x7 inch prints and I find this a very good amount of storage capacity in case you forget your Compact Flash card at home.<br />The manual is easy to read and gets the first-time digital camera user up to speed quickly. All features of the camera are covered with step-by-step instructions.<br />The drawbacks? They're nit-picks really.<br />* I'd prefer a little more heft and size to the camera to make it easier to grasp.<br />* The construction is not as solid-feeling as the Kodak DC series of cameras although this unit has very good fit and finish.<br />* Only two picture resolutions: high and medium. A low (640x480) resolution would be nice for web imaging.<br />* The camera does not support USB-Storage protocols. You must have the Kodak software or a compact flash card reader to transfer images to your computer.<br />* No provison for an AC adapter for studio use.","I recently bought this camera I did a lot of research.<br />for the price I doubt you can get a better camera , I have used a digital camera before, and I don't think there is too much else you could ask for.It takes supurb pictures.<br /> We were even able to catch water in mid-air. and take pictures of documents. It's an unbelievable, Camera. you won't regret this purchase..","I got the DX3500 for Christmas and I'm VERY pleased with it. I have a real nice Nikon camera for sale now. The only thing I have against this product is the short battery life. I guess it takes a lot more juice to run digital. I think I will invest in a camera dock for rechargable batteries. I have been looking at the DX3900 from Costco ... and that comes with a dock and rechargable batteries, but for now I'm having fun with my new toy. I wish I had something like this when I was in the Navy many years ago. One thing about it is I can rephotograph old pics and send them email. Too cheap to buy a scanner.:)","I received my camera as a Christmas gift. It's my first digital camera. It is nice looking and surprisingly light.  I'm a novice user, and getting started with the camera is a piece of cake.  I was taking pictures before the presents were all unwrapped.  I also reveived the dock that's used to download pictures into my computer. This is a must have. It is unbelievably simple. Literally put the camera on the dock, and press one button, and the system does the rest. The Kodak software opens, and the pictures are displayed right in front of you. Picture quality is outstanding. I think 2.2 megapixels is plenty. I've printed out 8x10s, and they come out sharp.Here's an unforseen serendipity: It feels great having the freedom to snap away, and just delete the pictures I don't want instantly. The feeling of losing that tense, \"make every picture count\" feeling you get with a regular camera is beautifully liberating.  Which leads me to another must have: an external memory card to insert into the camera. This will increase the amount of pictures you can take from about 20 with just the camera alone to about 50 for the smallest memory card.  They're fairly inexpensive and well worth it.  Downside: The camera has a digital zoom, but no optical zoom. In other words the lens doesn't physically extend when I want to zoom. I press a button, and it will zoom digitally. But in order to see how close you're getting using the digital zoom, you must look at the LCD screen, and not the viewfinder, which requires pulling the camera away from you face. It's awkward, and I would GLADLY pay the extra money for the next model up with the optical zoom. Great quality camera, simple simple simple to use.","This camera is the greatest!! Very fast transfer of photos from camera to computer. Longer battery life than other digital cameras. Very simple to operate. Very good quality of photos. User friendly. The software to download from camera to computer is fast and simple. The Kodak Photo software that comes with it is terrible. No option to delete photos you don't want without going to hard drive, finding file and deleting. Don't understand why there is not a delete option in the software. I use a different program for editing photos. Also, no option to easily reduce pixels or size in their software.","It took me a few minutes to get used to it but, once I got the hang of it, I found it very easy to use. The first thing that threw me off was the fact that it comes with a lithium battery pack (this is the version without the docking station). I spent a while trying to figure out how to charge the batteries before I realized I didn't need to.<br />Most of the time, it's easiest to use it like a regular camera -- point and shoot. If you use the digital zoom or the cloeup setting, though, you're better off using the viewing screen to line up a shot.<br />Another unexpected feature was the way it interfaces to a PC. I expected the device driver to use twain protocol. Instead, the camera, when plugged into the USB port, acts like an extra disk drive. The internal memory and memory card show up separate folders, each of which contain JPEG images, one for each picture taken. I can load, edit, save and delete the images using my favorite software. Couldn't be easier.<br />I've seen a number of reviews saying that the images are blurry. The only way I could manage to take blurry pictures was to turn off the flash and take a picture in low light, but that's true of any camera.<br />Using the digital zoom feature tended to result in pictures that were a bit grainy. That was pretty much what I expected, though. It's probably better to move closer to the subject when possible.<br />Overall, I found it hard to take bad pictures with this camera and, when I did, it was easy enough to delete them.","I've had this camera for about 1 week now... and there's nowhere I havn't taken it with me to! It's durable, easy to use and the quality is amazing. 2.2 megapixel is an amazing deal for the low price this camera is going or. I don't recommend getting the package that includes this camera and the charging/share dock though. You're just paying way too much money for something you don't even need, the dock. This camera is already easy to hook-up and though it does suck up batteries, you can just buy some rechargable batteries and a battery recharger. This camera is awesome! BUY IT NOW!","Very happy with product. Very easy to use point and shoot digital camera. This feature packed camera is reasonable priced. Not to fancy, yet does everything the average comsumer would want. Best if used in conjuction with Kodak EasyShare Camera Doc. (I have also reviewed this item.)<br />Note: If you use the LCD screen to \"take\" pitures it uses the battery faster. This camera has a digital, but no optical zoom.","Easy to use and set up. However if you use a Compaq laptop with Hot Swappable Bays, you must disable Bay swap.exe in the startup menu or the software will lockup your computer. I called Kodak to solve my problem and they were very helpful! The pictures I've taken look great, and the one touch picture transfer makes it simple to transfer your pictures to your computer. The docking station is a great feature. The extra memory card is a must have! I also purchased another card so I can take pictures on vacation without running out of space!","I've been using the Kodak DX3500 for about 3 weeks and have been very successful in good lighting conditions.  Indoor shots are a little dark, because the flash is not effective beyond 8 feet or so.  The usb connection for uploading to the computer is very fast, so bypass the docking station.  One trouble I've encountered is when uploading to the computer, the picture loading software freezes after uploading 24 pictures or so.  I need to disconect and restart to get the remaining pictures loaded.  Overall, this camera is a great value.  Simple to use, no complicated features, and picture quality is high.","I am very pleased with my camera.  It is my first digital camera and I learned to use it without help other than the manual.  It takes great pictures and they print out nicely.  I am pleased with the software program that loads to my computer . The loading dock is a must I feel.  I do have one regret however, I wish I and put out the extra money and purchased the 3600 model for the added zoom feature.  This is a great camera for its price and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a simple but nice camera.","Just bought this camera and used it on vacation this weekend.  The camera is very lightweight and so far the pictures have been great.  Cant believe how easy this camera is to use.  Just point and shoot.  The displays are very basic and after playing with it for a few minutes picked up how to use the various options.  The dock is a must though for downloading and invaluable for recharging the batteries.  For a first time digital camera I would definetly recommend this camera.  I love mine.","This is the most AWESOME digital camera in it's price range. It's even better than some in a much higher price range. I have owned 3 digital cameras, so believe me when I say I know about this one. It's simple, the pictures are great, and the best part is the dock. You just leave the camera on the dock and when you are ready to use it, it is ready for you. I have NEVER had a problem with low batteries. Downloading takes only seconds. This camera is very user friendly and very easy to operate.<br />YOU WILL NOT REGRET buying this camera one bit.  Thumbs up, Kodak!","i just bought the kodak dx3500 digital camera.so far i am very impressed.so far i have only taken about 8 pics,but the quality of the pics are very good in my opinion.also this is an easy to use item.i dont understand how anyone would complain about the pictures that come from this camera.I would recommend this camera to my friends.","This is my first digital camera and I wanted it to use mainly for the internet. It is simple to use, the pictures, including close-ups, are great. Distance photos for everyday use are really good too especially for the price of this camera compared to the complicated expensive models out there. The dock is definitely worth it, five seconds and you see your pictures, save them wherever you want them and you're done. The dock keeps the batteries charged all the time too. I am really happy with this purchase. It came in two days and we were up and running right away. Only thing I haven't figured out is how to get the dock to download directly to my D drive instead of C. Otherwise, you have to move the pix if you don't have room on your C drive. We have an older computer so we don't have much room left on the C drive. We chose this model over the 3600 because we didn't need the optical zoom (tried it in the store and the pix didn't seem as good as being 9\" from the item with the 3500) or the movie feature. Good quality all around.","I love my new digital camera. I used it at a friend's wedding and got very beautiful and clear pictures. The only reason I am not giving it five (5) stars is because the digital zoom is not good at all. The pictures that I tried doing a 'zoom' on were very fuzzy; so, if you want to eliminate this, then I would suggest the DX3600. It comes with stronger digital, plus it also has optical zoom. Other than this, I am truly enjoying my camera.","This is my first digital camera and I must say it is very easy to operate. Takes excellent pictures and it has adequate features for the price. The picture transfer software is great and easy to understand. You can make adjustments to your pictures. I plan to purchase the camera dock, picture cards and other accessories. Overall, am satisfied with this camera with the exception of the optical zoom.  If the optical zoom is a big deal to you, try the Kodak DX3600.","What an outstanding Pick...Very easy to use. The packaged software is just great, anyone (computer smart or not) can use it. The pictures taken so far have been great, easy to download to the Kodak soft ware and easy to print..You will just love the one touch Kodak docking station.What a great idea...","After purchasing this camera less than 2 weeks ago, I could  not believe how \"user friendly\" this piece of equipment really is.  I've always taken pictures with a 35mm camera and when my last camera crashed I decided to try a digital one.  After many, many hours of research on ratings of digital cameras, the DX3500 seemed to fit my needs very well. It's great for someone just learning to use a digital camera and the picture quality is fantastic.  I am able to get good quality pictures from the lower pixels and can e-mail or print them quite clearly.  I am impressed that I can take approximately 50 pictures with the internal memory set at the lower pixel and can take at least 16 pictures with the higher pixels.  The only problem I have thus far is the quality of the pictures taken when using the zoom feature of this camera.  The pictures are out of focus and fuzzy.  Not really a big issue for me since I normally am not a zoom lens picture taker anyways, but it is something that viewers should be aware of.  I couldn't be happier with my new purchase and each time I use the camera I'm getting to be more comfortable as an amateur photographer.","I purchased the Kodak Dx3500 and was immediately struck by its simple and esy to use menus.  It is definitely much easier to use than many other camers.  However, this particular camera does have a tendancy to take pitures which are dark and frequently need to be adjusted after-the-fact using the software package.  Also, the automatic flash rarely makes the right decision (flashes when it shouldn't, does not use a fill flash when it should).  It takes some experimentation to learn how to manually set the flash for different indoor lighting conditions.  Picture quality was fine, once any darkness was adjusted.  The digital zoom creates blurry pictures every time.  If zooming is an important feature for you, this is not your camera.  The 16 meg card and docking station are definite pluses.","I've had my 3500 over a month now and love it. I have experienced some of the problems that other's have commented on (blurriness with zoom...) but for a $300 camera I think it does everything it was expected to do. If I want to make sure I don't miss a moment, that is what film is for. But for just snapping away and not worrying about film (i have the 64mb Viking card) it is great.<br />I have experienced one problem that is annoying, while taking pictures it seems the camera gets confused about the internal memory and the flash card, even though I am set on 'auto', for flash card first, then internal. So I will show 398 pics left, then it will be 41, or such. I can go through the menu and find the pics, but sometimes I have to pop the flash card and reinsert and start up again. I wrote to Kodak but they only sent back the standard support email.","I was pumped to finally get a digital camera with 2.2 megapixels for under [...].  who wouldn't be?  I was even more excited because I would be able to use it on the North Slope of Alaska, taking pictures of my job experience and the amazing wildlife surrounding me.  I took a few pictures, some were great, and some were blurry.  I figured it was my own inexperience with the digital world.  Yet, when I found myself surrounded by what was estimated to be 2,000 caribou, I felt confident that I would capture every great image opportunity.  As I loaded the pics on my computer, I was extremely dissapointed.  2 out of 20 pictures turned out good, the rest... blurry!  I loved the camera, but it took bad pictures.  Fork out the extra [...] and buy something nicer that will actually capture your memories.","i like the dx3500 even though i wanted the dc3400 but it was no longer on the market.my only problem with it is the connection to the computer.i would of liked to see a serial port hook up as well as usb.plus when you take a picture sometimes it comes out blurry,for the price of these cameras i would think the quality would be better,but i still like it alot better than a normal camera.","This is a great camera that is easy to use and the dock makes downloading, E-mailing & printing a snap. However, you canot buy extra batterie packs anywhere including direct from Kodak ( they are on back order all the time )","This is a great camera. It is simple and creates amazing pictures. True, it does not have a lot of bells and whistles but it has what you need to make great pictures and with a great price.","I bought the camera just a few days ago.i took it to my cusin's wedding and i took over 111 pictures using the compact flash 64mb.Half of them were good quality and the over half were best quality,i was surprized by the quality.i bought with it the dock.The package contains every thing except the campact flash card.If you're going to buy it i advice u to bye it from amazon with the dock,it's price is excelent.U can buy it with out the dock.It has a usb port connection but i advice u with the dock becuase u can download faster and recharge the camera with the spiecal battries (included). I hope u enjoy it,o ya don't forget the compact flash.if you're having truoble with it e-mail me at:malekawt@hotmail.com ok. Bye","2.2 megapixels for $300 is a great deal! So much for the lack in zoom, you're not paying for the zoom. I was surprised at how good of quality that these pictures were. With two other digital camera owners in the house, I have been able to compare this camera with both the Canon Elph, and the Nikon CoolPix, which are both about $200-$300 more in price. And the resolution compared significantly. If you are looking for a great camera at a low price, definately get this camera, it's worth the extra price of the dock. Have Fun!!","I have two SLRs. I fancy manual cameras. But I decided to buy this product so that I could take spontaneous photos when I take my family out to crowded locations and do not have the time to fiddle with the SLR.<br />I love it. It is well built and takes excellent pictures -- just the right thing for snapshots. The controls are well thought out and so is the menu system. The camera is so easy that my technophobe wife can easily operate it. This camera may not be for someone that wants better control over the pictures they take. This is a good digital equivalent of your basic disposable camera.<br />I've lopped off one star for the fixed-focus lens. It would have been better to have autofocus. However as far as I can see the pictures (without zoom) are quite sharp even when blown up to 8x10. I did not buy the dock. Uploading via the little connector from the camera to the PC worked fine and I did not know what benefit an additional docking station brought.","This digital camera is a delight to own and use. Make sure you get the dock as well. This bundle is so great because it INCLUDES the Kodak DX 3500 digital camera *and* the Kodak Camera Dock. As someone who has used cameras that do not come with a simple snap-in bundled dock, I've been frustrated, but this makes it soooo easy to upload images to your computer for sharing and/or printing. The dock is also great because it recharges the battery in a snap, instead of fumblign with awkward chargers and losing batterie around the house. (\"Honey, where's the battery charging now?\")<br />The camera itself has a 2.2-megapixel sensor that allows you to ceate generous prints up to 8\" x 10\". Most people tend to stick to the 4\" x 6\" prints, but it is nice to have the option.<br />The 3x digital zoom lens with autofocus and 8 MB internal memory is enough for most pictures, but this could have been a bit larger. In some instances you might find yourself hurrying back to the computer to transfer the images so you can take more pics. Depending on the format size of the image, you'll be able to take about 40 photos (more than a 36 exposure roll of tradtional film - yeah!) before needing to transfer images to your computer. Overall, this is a great camera at a super value.","Absolutely pleased with all aspects of the DX3500.  If you're looking for very good pictures, good battery life/charger, decent price, ease of use, and don't need all the bells and whistles, this is the camera for you.  The resolution of the pictures rivals the $1000 cameras from 3-4 years ago, and most $400-$500 cameras today.  The docking station is a must for the super fast battery charger 2.5 hours and quick upload of pictures.  You can't really compare this to any camera on the market, since cameras are either expensive and have loads of options or cheap and an inferior picture/battery.  Over the next couple of years, all cameras will be copying what Kodak did here with the docking station/charger.  I haven't even needed to purchase a Flash Memory Card yet, since the internal memory on this camera holds 16 FINE resolution pics (48 good res pics, I believe).  The fixed lens on this camera produced breathtaking pics; the zoom was not impressive, but I didn't really buy the camera to utilize the zoom that much.  Great camera, great price!","compact cam and extremely easy to use - plug and play - I love it","Easy to use camera right out of the box, and a breeze to download and send e-mail. Kodak has good software and good tech support to go with it. If you buy the camera, do get the loading dock to,it's great to have, and save's alot of time. Good job KODAK.","The Kodak DX 3500 was rated at four stars. I find mine to be FIVE STARS. It would be interesting to know if the other owners have the Camera Dock. Yes, it's [expensive] but what a breeze to use. Pop the camera into the docking station and push the button and your pictures are loaded into your computer. Also, if you are using rechargeable cells the docking station will keep them fully charged. A full charge from dead flat in 2.5 hours. The camera itself is a delight to use. I never used one before and had mine up and running with the supplied software loaded and the first three test pictures (of my cat) on the monitor screen in about 1/2 hour. This little camera does more then my 35mm SLR and I see instant results. If I do not like the picture for what ever reason (camera angle, subject movement, etc.) I can delete the shot and retake it. In about 3 minutes I have written a letter with a picture attached and sent to my children and grandchildren living 300 miles away. They share our lives as we live it, not as an afterthought three weeks later when the film is developed, we pick out the pictures we want to send, and then \"snail-mail\" the pictures to them. I don't know why I waited so long to buy a digital camera and this Kodak DX 3500 fits the bill.","GREAT CAMERA, EXCELLENT PICTURES,EASY TO USE SOFTWARE,COULDN'T BE EASIER TO USE. BUY THE DOCKING STATION IT'S WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY YOU COULD'NT FIND A BETTER CAMERA FOR THE MONEY. KODAK REALLY MAKES IT EASY.","I purchased the DX3500 to replace a Polaroid 640x480 digital camera, since that point I have been very pleased with the Kodak.  The ease of use, picture quality and battery life with 2 AA batteries has been very impressive.  The Cons to this camera are lack of optical zoom, and lack of exposure control.","I received this camera as a Mothers Day gift and I can't believe how easy it is to use. The zoom feature is so simple. The software makes uploads a breeze. I was able to get 27 pictures on the 8MB installed memory with the camera set to the best quality setting. There's room for an expansion card so the number of pictures far exceeds a standard roll of film. Installation of the software was quick and flawless. Picture quality is great. Definitely a great little camera for the money.","THIS CAMERA IS EVERYTHING A PERSON WANTS THAT DOESNT KNOW MUCH ABOUT ELECTRONIS! IT IS SO SIMPLE TO USE, ALL YOU DO IT POINT AND SHOOT! AND PLACE IT ON THE DOCKING STATION, WHEN YOU THEN UPLOAD YOUR PICTURES! AND THEN....SEND THEM TO FAMILY OR FRIENDS OR PRINT THEM! SO EASY TO USE, NO WONDER KODAK IS #1.  :)"]},{"name":"Kodak DX3600","amazon_reviews":["Have not got into using much..seems OK","Excellent Camera, which is now 4,5 years old and still working properly.<br /><br />The reason I decided to write this review now (I had forgot) is to say the Kodak cameras have a good advantage over the sony ones: the dimension of the pictures are the same of the printed photos (same proportion) and the computers screens. This means nothing is cut when you get them printed.","I've had a kodak DX 3600 camera now for about 2 years.  I have found that the quality of pictures has been excellent and the video mode is brilliant, as few digital cameras offer video with sound being recorded too.  At the start i had battery problems and problems with it powering down unexpectedly but it was sent back to Kodak and it was a faulty connection between the power section and main part of the camera, since then i have had little problems with power, like all didgital cameras they do go through batteries but just be sure to have enough charged up, and the dock it comes with  handily charges the batteries.  At 2.2 mega pixels i have found it brilliant, there is brilliant image quality for what i'm using it for and it doesn't take up alot of hard drive space, with the average photo taking up about 400Kb on the best picture quality setting.  I would reccemmend this camera.","This camera surprisingly prints great quality pictures in 3x5 to 5x7 sizes.  The only problem I have with this camera is the rechargeable battery life is poor.  The camera dock and the rapid charger does not adequately charge the batteries and I own 3 batteries and have a problem with all of them.  I own the Kodak DX6490 now and do not have a problem with the battery keeping charged, so I believe they fixed this problem with later models.","I am amazed at the quality of photos the DX3600 produces.  Prints are crisp and color excellent quality.  It's light weight, simple to use (afer studying the manual for about one hour), displays the shot immediately in the LCD window, so one can retake, if necessary.  I found the internal memory got used up far too quickly so upgraded to a memory card, which works beautifully.  The software is easy to use and enables one to crop, adjust color, etc., effortlessly.  Uploading, e-mailing and printing are no-brainers.  It may lack the sophistication of more expensive models, but for the price I don't think one could do better.","Have not got into using much..seems OK","Excellent Camera, which is now 4,5 years old and still working properly.<br /><br />The reason I decided to write this review now (I had forgot) is to say the Kodak cameras have a good advantage over the sony ones: the dimension of the pictures are the same of the printed photos (same proportion) and the computers screens.

I would agree with their assesment<br />First the good features:<br />The first thing that sets this camera apart is the optical zoom.  The ability to zoom in or out just that little bit makes getting the right photo that much easier.  Digital zoom is a worthless gimmick that will degrade your picture quality a great deal, if you plan on using zoom go for the optical.<br />This camera also has a macro setting, which allows very close pictures of plants and insects to turn out suprisingly well.<br />The movie setting is another bonus, that allows you to take small movies complete with sound.  The movie quality is not great and it only works when well lit, but I have had a lot of fun with it.  It is just about perfect for posting short clips on the web.<br />The ease of use is fairly good.  The picture quality is very good.<br />The bad points:<br />The display screen washes out in strong sunlight.  To be fair this is comon to most cameras.<br />It is a little bulky by modern standards.  I think most point and shoot film cameras were about this size.  If you plan to stick it in your pocket make sure you have big pockets.<br />Battery life is subpar and drain is very high.  You will not be able to use alkaline batteries, only Ni-Mh or Lithium.  With a few extra sets of batteries long trips should be fine, but don't forget the batteries.<br />The optical viewfinder is cheaply made, hard to use, and somewhat innacurate.  It is still usable, but I expected better from Kodak.  Use the display screen when possible.","I purchased this camera a year ago--after being convinced that digital was as good, if not better than film.  I'm not going to debate the pros and cons between the two here.  What I will tell anyone that's interested is that I picked this camera after doing some research as to what you want in a digital camera.<br />Consumer Reports ranked this camera as a Best Buy in it's class.  The DX3600 is a 2.2 megapixel camera.  On high resolution, it takes a 1200x1600 picture.  The color and clarity are phenominal to work with.  With resolution so great, it's a nice way to take pictures and easily enlarge them to 8x10s without losing the clarity.<br />The buttons are minimal, and the full color menu is easy to navigate and understand.  I did not feel the need to read an owner's manual when I received my camera.  It was truely a point and shoot.<br />I purchased a 128mb card to use with my camera.  I have been able to go on trips for 7-8 days, take 25-20 high resolution pictures each day, and I still have room to add more pictures to the card.  How nice to not have to worry about carrying around film anymore.<br />The camera is light-weight, easy to handle, and easy to carry.  It's the perfect point-and-shoot camera to take on a walk, to a party, or on a trip.<br />Add all of this to the fact that the DX3600 is affordable, and you can't beat it!<br />If you're given the chance, give this camera a chance--you'll be delighted you did!","I bought this camera about 1.5 yrs ago, and it's still in great condition and gives real value for somebody who wants a beginner digital camera. Let's also not forget that it also allows to you to shoot some video, and that it is very easy to hook up to a TV (using a supplied composite cable)...U can of course just plug it into your computer using USB. If you are using Windows XP, you don't even need to install the supplied software, XP, just recognises the camera easily and gives you wizards to help u out, but for pre-XP operating systems, you will have to install the supplied software. The menus and interface are very basic and easy to use.<br />I don't recommend this camera for pros, it is definitely not meant for them. The zooming is very basic, and the digital zoom is practically useless(never got a clear picture with it). The flash is useless at night without some serious extra light sources. DEFINITELY buy the optional Camera Dock and here's why: The lithium batteries recommended for this camera are only available on this continent currently, and are VERY HARD TO FIND outside it (and also very expensive - if you are going in for the CRV3). I have been in India for the past yr, and wasted many of the regular alkaline batteries, until they finally started carrying CRV3s over here recently. Boy do I regret not buying the dock and rechargables!!!<br />Overall, though, this camera is a great buy for somebody who is new to Digital Cameras","What a great camera.  My wife and I purchased this camera about a year ago and have put over 1,000 pictures through it.  It still works great and I've never had an issue with it.  There are your basic issues that you have with all digital camera (digital zoom is not something you will use a lot, poor light will give you dim pictures) but, again, this is something you will find in one way or another in all cameras.  We purchased the camera alone and were always thinking about the dock (in Win. XP..when you hook the camera up to your computer via USB cable, the software kicks in and you are immediately at the wizard to download pictures...so the dock is by no means necessary).  We received the dock, batteries, case, tripod, paper combo for christmas and have been happy with that as well.  The rechargable batteries are not performing for us at all.  They will hold their charge for a few pictures but if you are using the screen to preview them, the batteries will soon die.  I like to use cheap old AA's and they work for months at a time.  The features of the camera make it great to work with and the pictures are of a great quality even hastily printed out.  The software was quickly installed by my wife (the person who swears she's not computer friendly) in a few minutes and we have never had an issue with it.  We have now added a 32 meg memory card and have 98 pictures on the highest quality setting!<br />Basically, if you're looking for a point and shoot...pick the camera up, you won't be dissappointed.  Definitely get a memory card of at least 32 megs but give the dock and all that a second thought.  It's a great upsell but isn't necessary, and if you aren't a fan of the rechargeable batteries...is almost completely unnecessary.","Ive owned this for a little over a year now and it has never let me down.  Ive taken about 900 pictures/videos with it and its still running great.  I did a LOT of comparing when I decided to buy this camera.  I wanted a camera around 2 mega-pixels, decent zoom, decent battery life, and most importantly, unlimited video capabilities that included sound.  This camera was pretty much the only one at the time that met all those guidelines.  Other cameras matched pretty evenly as far as megapixels, zoom, and battery life went, but what sold me on the Kodak was the fact that it was practically the only camera that ALSO had video that was only limited by the size of the memory card you had in it AND the fact that it had sound on top of that.  The only thing about the video is that if you want to take video in doors you really need a lot of light.  It will come out kinda dark otherwise.  But for the money it is rather excellent.<br />I compared this to my friends Nikon of about the same caliber.  While his pictures turned out a little bit better it was close enough for me to still prefer my Kodak.<br />The configuration menu has just about everything I would ever want to modify in it.  Date stamping, quality adjustments, and a \"close\" mode for taking pictures of something within a few feet of the lens.<br />The battery life is pretty much what you would expect from a digital camera.  If you use the display too much it will run out pretty quickly, but thats never been a problem for me.  Im still using the same battery pack(ive recharged it a bunch of times in the last year, of course).  I bought the docking station with it.  Heres a tidbit that Im not sure others are fully aware of yet:  You can use the camera while its on the docking station.  So if youre just taking a pictures of things in one room(like i often do for ebay auctions), you wont ever have to worry about battery life.  It can run from the power of the docking station.<br />This camera has been great and Ive never regretted buying it.","Generally speaking, I am satisfied with kodak 3600.  I bought this camera for my newborn baby.  It is my first digi-camera.  And it works pretty good so far.  The color is bright and vivid.  The resolution is good enough for home use.  The only drawback I found is that the writing speed to CF card is not fast enough.  I can take 3 to 4 photos very quickly, then need to wait like 10 seconds to let it finish writing to CF card.  I feel that Canon S200 is much faster considering the writing speed.","I have owned this camera for a few months now and I love it for several reasons. It has superbly excellent outdoor picture quality and its indoor pictures are great, too. Be warned, the movie feature isn't that great. Outdoor is o.k. and o.k. means 75 marks out of 100. But the indoor ones, you can hardly see what, I would give it 25 out of 100. It is a big dis advantage of not being to use the flash while taking movies. And I can tell you in full faith, buy the CRV3 lithium for a few bucks extra and though it is rare some studios have it, because the alkalines are wasted on this camera. It takes up a huge lot of battery power. I have praised this camera, but the greatest feature about it is the quality I get for 2.2MP. It is simply suberb. You can get top class 8x10 prints with this and as for the 4x6 and 6x8 photos, you can't get better ones than this in studios. If you are trying to buy the dock, DON'T. And I mean it. It's a waste of [money]. The USB port transfer software and hardware are VERY GOOD. Do not hesitate with the buying of the dock thinking whether it is useful. It isn't unless you want to charge your Ni-MH batteries.","This is my second camera & I bought this one because it was compatible with the built in photo programs on my Mac. Works great with the hardware that I have. I would give this product 5 stars because the hardware is great but when trying to figure out how to download the movie clips to my mac I called Kodak ... still waiting...","The best deal I could of found","Decent battery life, I use rechargeable Nickel Hydride and find that just two in this camera hold up nearly as well as the four I used in my last Kodak camera. Instead of the Easy Share system, I opted to buy extra batteries and more compact flash memory since I'm on the road and download my photographs to my laptops through a PCMCIA adapter or a USB card reader into whichever computer I'm nearby.  The files are JPEGs and not KDC format, so most computers easily recognize the files in the cards and transfer them using Windows Explorer for quick copy and paste or drag and drop functions. The Kodak transfer software is easy to use and the email feature that automatically allows the sender to select one of three file sizes to keep transfer time to a minimum.  It produces decent video segments, which depend on the speed of the compact flash to store more than a couple of minutes of video.  The quality of the images from this 2 megapixel camera is very good.  I carry it in my jacket pocket and it gets banged around and still produces great images.  If I wanted a higher image quality camera, I'd have to give up the flexibility and ease of access; and for my uses, it works just fine.<br />I'd like to see a little more positive feedback when I trip the shutter, as going from the half down to focus, and the full down to take the photo isn't a distinct tactile sensation.  The screen in full sun is sometimes hard to see. The digital movies are produced to use Quicktime MOV file formats, so not everyone easily displays them as compared to the MPEG when they're passed to family or friends.  I'd buy another, maybe two, especially at these prices.","I'm a camera and cell-phone maniac to begin with and this product has satisfied our needs impeccably. The film quality is quite good outdoors though the indoor quality isn't marvellous. I didn't buy the dock and I find it quite easy to transfer with the USB cable. The picture quality is exceptional. Indoor and outdoor pictures, you get far more than you expect. And talking about safety my camera easily survived a 2 foot fall 1 and a half weeks after it was brought and the batteries just came out, thats all. The zoom is not enough to be precise, but o.k. I have'nt experienced the battery problem that many users are talking about and I am quite happy without the charger(mind you, I'm on my 1st set of batteries.) though I off the camera whenever I finish using it. This camera is marvellous.","I have just purchased this camera and already I am very impressed with the quality and ease of use.<br />The product came with the batteries,  I put them in and I was already to take a picture.  It was extremmely easy to download this picture onto my computer (with the provided software ) and e-mail it off to the grandparents and aunts/uncles.  I do not have the dock,  which is an extra,  but I understand that a dock makes it even easier ( if that is possible ).<br />I have fun taking short videos of the kids and then playing it back on the LCD screen for all to watch.  I have not yet tried to send a video through the e-mail,  but I am sure going to have fun trying.<br />I shopped around and both my husband and I are extremely satisfied with the excellent quality and the extra features that come with this product.  Well worth the money!!","Beofre I had this camera, I had many \"Sure Shot\" film cameras. Since early this year, this camera has provided me everything I have expected and much more-with a very good price (refurbished; I also brought a 64MB memory card-a must for digital camera- plus a backup rechargeable battery). Last week, I took this camera to a very fancy wedding in New Jersey. I shot around 30 pictures. Since it was done in an evening at low light situation, many of them were not successful because the distance was a little too far. For those that were within the flash light range, they looked real good. I published them in OFOTO website and sent the link to people whom I captured on the picture - without having to print a single copy. Before this, I often used this camera to also capture motion film of my two cats - as they hunted for the flies or jumped to capture toys. These were fun moments that I have sent to my daughter in school to keep her updated. I will eventually print some paper copies along with other photos I had, but this experience has made me a beliver of digital camera and the price and quality provided by DX3600 has made this possible. From my last batch of OFOTO pictures, I really don't think you will need a camera with more than 2.1MB Pixels if you only print the pictures with 4x6 or 5x7 sizes. Granted, this camera is not perfect; but I remembered no real disappointments and a lot of great benefits and therefore gave it a 5 rating.","I have enjoyed this camera a lot since I purchased it in April.  I have never had a problem with picture quality.  My wife is an artist and she has done sketches by looking the digital version of the picture.  The printed print quality is not as good - but I have had excellent results after manipulating the image in Photoshop. (I do the same for pictures or images I scan through a scanner. Once you're used it, the pre-press process only takes a couple of minutes per picture.)  For the price I paid, I'm satisfied with the image quality.  I do notice that I end up white balancing many of my indoor shots.<br />The ease of use makes up for this in my mind.  I'll take a 100 to 200 pictures in a weekend and color correct 10-20.  The zoom is weak, but the 'shutter' speed is decent and I've even gotten some decent motion shots.  One of the things I love about this camera is the number of shots I can fit on a 64 bit memory card...<br />The video feature is also very cool.  It was an unexpected bonus with the camera.  With a large memory card I can take several minutes of video before having to dock the camera. The video is not the greatest quality - but its nice to have a video camera that fits in your pocket.<br />If you're a serious photographer who wants to print every shot this is probably not your best bet, but if you're looking for a versatile digital camera for a reasonable price - I'd recommend the DX3600.","The DX3600 2.2 gig. camera is very nice.You can make 8x10\" blow ups that are beautiful.And get great shots inside, outside, sunny or cloudy. Great zoom, plus you can get a lens kit for it. And the softwear that comes with it is makes it so easy to record the pictures onto your hard drive,drop into the kodak picture program to print or enlarge, correct or E-mail. I like Mine, you should get one.","Overall, if you're looking for a flexible, easy-to-use, easy-to-learn digi-cam, the DX3600 from Kodak is a nice place to start.  It's basically a point and shoot camera that makes digital photography (and videography!!!) accessible even to non-techies.<br />FEATURES:<br />Digital Camera:  At it's highest resolution of 1800X1200 it can hold about 25 pictures or so.  The easy to review LCD screen gives you instant feedback on your pictures and helps you decide on the spot whether or not they are worth keeping.  You can add on another memory card to give you even more flexibility with the number of shots you can take.<br />Digital Video:  This is actually what sets this product apart from others in the market.  The digital video features allows you to actually record up to several minutes of video.  The video is automatically saved to MPEG format for easy playback on your PC.<br />Easily Works With Your PC:<br />The DX3600 connects easily with your PC and comes with transfer software so you can easily download, edit and e-mail your pictures and videos, this allowing you to share your pictures easier with family and friends.<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Overall, if you need a nice, easy to use camera to record your everday (and not so everyday) moments, the DX3600 is a nice camera to start with.  If you need somewhat they gives real close attention to detail (like if you're taking pictures of documents with fine print) this isn't for you.  However, for everyday/normal/touristy use, this is just perfect.<br />Highly Recommended","Coming from a guy who is not that good with electronics, I found this camera easy and fun to use. Not only is it quick and easy to take point and shoot pictures, but the software that comes with the camera makes it is easy to upload your favorites onto your home computer. This Kodak camera is lightweight, compact, and will be easy to take with you on vacations, parties, or anywhere else you could possibly need a camera. The LCD screen is nice and in a great format. The picture is clear and the menus are easy to scroll through. You can line your picture up using the view finder, or (which is another nice thing about this camera) you can line up what you are going to take the picture of in the LCD screen and get it lined up exactly how you want it.<br />If you are looking for an easy to use, quick and efficent camera. This is the one. Kodak does a superb job making the picture experience as fun and painless as possible.","Just returned from two days in Colonial Williamsburg and shot 253 pics. This is my first foray into the digital camera world and it was super tough leaving my EOS Rebel at home. I'm used to the 28-300mm zoom lens and shooting shot after shot quickly. I bought the 3600 in March 2002 and this was my first real \"test\" with it. Both good and bad...<br />First the good: When I returned last night I loaded all 253 shots into my Mac Powerbook using iPhoto. Loading and previewing the images was a snap! Probably over 95% of the shots were good. It took a few shots for me to properly steady my pics, but I did. I really enjoyed the ability to immediately see what I had shot and determine whether to keep it or not, although in the bright sunlight seeing images in the display is difficult. I like simply putting another compact flash card into the slot instead of changing film every 24 shots or so. I had taken the camera to a friend's wedding a month earlier and found that the flash is only good for about 8-10 feet or so. So, for distances over that, turn off the flash. You will be surprised how well the shots turn out.<br />The bad: From what I had experimented with earlier, there really is a lot more light out there that one would imagine. But, this meant turning off the flash each time the camera was turned on. Yes, that's right, with digital cameras, unlike my EOS, I had to turn it on each time I wanted to take a pic. We stopped by a park on the way to eat lunch and after taking a few initial shots, I left the camera on while I ate a sandwich. Batteries totally unusable. I had to switch to the backup set and put the others on charge.  Being used to the zoom capabilities of my 35mm, I found the 2X optical somewhat lacking. I used it more for framing the shot than zooming. There were some instances where a better zoom would have been nice. I had experiemented enough to stay from the digital zoom, because I am not that steady.<br />I also noticed that there is no way to control the exposure; it's automatic. Again, being used to the EOS, I did have a few blurry shots where the lens stayed opened longer that I wanted. I also should have bought a \"pouch\" or something to carry my camera and accessories in. The wrist strap fit nicely and the camera is easily used with only one hand, but having it around my neck would have been more comfortable to me...yes, the EOS thing again.<br />Overall: Probably my biggest complaint is the zoom capabilities and lack of control over exposure. Again, there is turning the flash off each time I turned on the camera. I finally worked out the system, \"flash\" \"flash\" \"select\" to turn it off when unable to easily see the display.<br />Would I recommend this to first-timers? Yes, it's a good camera for the money and the 2mp is plenty...I don't remember the last time I printed a pic larger than 8X10...do you? I used the highest quality setting all the time and turned the viewfinder off to save battery consumption.<br />I may still go back to the EOS on the next trip I take...maybe not. I think I will look for the Olympus 2100 because of its zoom and stabilizer capabilities. (I didn't buy it earlier because I hesitated to spend [the money] to begin digital photography.) Buy this as your first digital camera and experiment with it a lot. It is actually a good camera and will help you make the transition into digital photography. As I said, for the next excursion, I will either take the EOS or get the Olympus. Digital has the advantage of not having to change the film cartridge every 24 shots and then not having to wait for the local \"one-hour\" developer to see what you have taken. That is something I really like.<br />I hope you found this info helpful.","I bought the DX3600 about a month ago, and was immediately impressed with the quality of the photos and extreme ease of use.  I had done fair amount of research and determined that this unit was the best bang for the buck in the 2 megapixel digital camera price range.  I even added the docking station which is a nice convenience to recharge the batteries and transfer images with no hassle.<br />Another selling point for me was the video mode, which works very well (no, this is not camcorder quality) for quick clips of my son that I can save or email.  It would be nice to have an option to at least use the 2X optical zoom (why not?) to bring the action a little closer, but it is what it is.<br />However, it did not take long to realize that there was a problem.  The battery life would ususally only last for 10-20 shots, than just die without warning.  I tried leaving it on the charger longer, but the same thing kept happening--sometimes even worse!  I figured that unit must be defective, so I took it back for a replacement.  The new unit worked only marginally better for the first day, but then started acting just like the other one.  Major inconvenience!<br />I would expect to be able to shoot AT LEAST 60+ shots with the LCD screen in use before the batteries flopped, but no such luck.  I have even been careful to shut it off when I was not about to use it again immediately.  Often times it would just not turn on again!<br />I have read reviews from many others who have had similar problems, but I am not willing to deal with Kodak to try fixing it.  It is truely a shame, because it is so very simple to operate and the picture quality is excellent.  Be that as it may, I am dumping this unit and buying a Canon PowerShot S330 ELPH camera.  They are a bit more expensive, but seem to offer more for the money (including a 3X optical zoom rather than a 2X) and do not seem to have such reliability problems.  Also, the Kodak is definately not pocket sized as is the Canon.  I wish I could recomment the DX3600, but it just dissapoints.","This is my first digital camera, and it is terrific! Easy to use, even for someone who doesn't read instructions. I took many pictures using the standard quality setting and they are excellent. The one touch transfer process is a breeze, and the camera capacity with the 128 MB picture card I purchased is more than sufficient. The digital movies I took are quite good, and the sound is excellent. I would recommend this camera without reservation.","This camera is a great starter or all purpose camera.  It takes great pictures and is quite simple to use.  There are not a lot of bells and whistles to confuse the novice, or burdon those who want to just point and shoot, but it still takes great pictures.  Be prepared to purchase a memory card as the 8MB internal memory will be very limiting.","This is my third digital camera.  All of them have been Kodak & I had been satisfied with them (aside from a few issues on the DC50) - they are all still working fine.  I bought this one for the 2 megapixel resolution, the optical zoom and the 2:3 image ratio (so you can print out a 4x6 image without cropping).  After using it, I also like how light it is - it only requires two batteries rather than four (as some of it's competitors).  The video feature comes in handy in a pinch. Certainly plan to upgrade to at least a 128mb Compact Flash card.<br />There is always room for improvement.  USB 2.0 support would be good (it can never be fast enough). A 3x optical zoom or better would make it more attractive to consumers.  The looks are goofy - I think I prefered the traditional forms of earlier models & the on/off switch keeps switching back on as I slip the camera into the camera case.","I still wasn't sure, but when I saw the 8 by 10 I printed where my black cat's fur was visible as fur, not a black blotch, and he was easily recognizable, the colors of his cat tunnel were bright, as the tunnel actually is, and many of the titles in the bookcases behind him could be read. I got some close-ups of my two black cats that I'm really pleased with. I use the USB connection to upload to my computer. The software is easy and prints various sizes, including 3 by 5 - four on a page.","Well first of all I should say that I have a new Mac Ibook because I see that there seems to be problems with the kodak program using windows.  I should also say that this is not my first digital camera so with that said here's what I think.<br />This is probably the best digital camera either myself or my friends have used.  Because I was familiar with digital cameras I had also bought a 128 card so i could take  200 pics on the best mode (1800 x 1200) which takes excellent pictures and on the good mode (900 x 600) i can take almost 700!!  The controls were so easy I didn't have to read the instructions to figure out how to work it and when I was done taking pictures...I didn't even have to load software because Macs come with IPhoto and all you do is plug in the usb conection and push the little button on the dock (i'll get into the dock in a minute) and wham...there are your photos.  Unbelievably simple....unlike other experiences I have had with digitals where the instructions might as well be written in another language...<br />The video that comes with the camera is great when you don't want to bring a camcorder and your camera.  And the really nice feature is while most cameras are limited to 30 sec of video and sometimes no sound, this camera does sound and is only limited in time to how much memory you have.  I've shot  3 minutes worth of stuff that nobody else got.<br />Run out and buy this camera, there are lots of deals and you won't be disappointed.<br />Here are my recommendations if you do buy this camera:<br />1.  all digital cameras don't do well on regular batteries so do yourself a favor and buy the dock which comes with rechargable batteries.  Also it keeps the batteries charged constantly which is nice.  The dock also has a single button to push to transfer  all your pictures which is nice also.  I have no idea why they don't just package the two together since you really do need to have the dock.<br />2.  As with all digital cameras, buy extra memory the day you buy it.  8 is just not enough for anything and I don't know why all the camera companies continue to even sell cameras with just 8.  Buy as much memory as you can afford, that way when your at your special event  you won't run out of memory right when you need to take a picture.","Excellent picture, with great features and user-friendly software.  I have had to return the camera several times due to problems with battery back and docking station.  Because this was one of the first models with the docking station, I recommend buying a later model DX3700, 3900, 4900, etc.  Hopefully they have worked out the kinks.","As someone who remembers to develop her film a year or more after it is done and takes a year to complete a roll, I just couldn't be classified as a shutterbug. Now that I don't have to worry about the cost of film developing and the extra step of taking it to get developed, I've begun to take lots of pictures and experiment.<br />This camera was a good value for the money and easy to set up on my Win98 system. The pictures come out very well.<br />The only problems that I had with the camera is that the battery pack that you use with the dock seems to sit loose in my camera, occasionally causing the camera to think that it is out of batteries. When that happens, I simply reseat the batteries and I am fine. This doesn't happen often enough for it to impact my enjoyment of the camera. (This is most likely the issue with the camera not turning on, but flashing a red light that a few people mention below.)","I am a newbie to the digital world.  I selected a Kodak because I thought it would be a good entry level brand to go with...easy to use, etc.  I was not disappointed.  The camera is very easy to use and generates great pictures...with great sharpness and wonderful color.  The dock makes transferring the jpeg image files to computer a snap, and the Kodak software allows you to manage the images very easily. My only surprise came with how quickly the batteries are used up.  Although the dock recharges the batteries while the camera is mounted, I have gone out and purchased a supplemental charger and extra batteries to keep me snapping away without having to quit after one set of batteries is gone.<br />A great choice for my first foray into the digital world!","I bought this camera in February and sold in May to buy a better one (a Kodak DX4900). Why? I'll explain.<br />This camera has a great price value, takes very good pictures. If you don't have more money, buy this one. But be warned, 2MP is simply not enough. I don't need super-fantastic-extra quality prints but I do like getting a 6x8 or 8x10 print where you can't tell if the picture has been taken from a digital camera or from film camera.<br />The printers most online photo companies use to print digital images print 300dpi (dots per inch). That means that to get the best picture you can have you need a picture with that resolution. If you want a 4x6 print you'll need a (300x4) x (300x6) picture. That is 1800x1200, which is the maximum resolution this camera offers. That's right; you need at least 2MP to print a perfect 4x6 print. If you don't believe me, ask the company where you'll get you're prints from, what's the resolution of their printers. Yes, with 2MP you get good 6x8 prints and not to bad 8x10. But to get a 8x10 picture where you can't tell if it's a film picture or a digital one you need at least 3MP or more.<br />If you don't mind about the resolution, the camera is perfect. I loved it. Except the sound of the videos had a poor quality and my batteries usually ended before my 64MB Compact Flash filled up. I always took extra batteries in my pocket.","Kodak has done it again. This super Camera offers many quality features you can trust upon. For me, the dock is utterly irrelevant. You can transfer pics equally well without it.<br />Super thing!<br />CONGRATULATIONS! KODAK AND AMAZON","Wow!!!  What a nice camera.  This is definitely a camera made for a man. I was able to use the camera without reading any of the directions.(I eventually did read them). The lithium battery that came with the Camera are still going strong.  Also the recordable .mov movies that you can create and share over the internet are great. But they do take up a good chunk of memory. The only down side is having to ...spend the moneyfor the docking bay.  You can't recharge the batteries without it.<br />Overall: good work Kodak, you made me a loyal buyer.","I've used this camera for about 8 months and very pleased with it. If you buy the dock, it keeps the camera charged 24/7 and comes with a one-touch transfer feature for beginners. It's great that you don't have a time limit when recording video! Even most of the expensive brands have a 5 to 60 second time limit...but DX3600 will keep recording as long as you have free space in your multimedia card. Good sound quality during playback and looks good even on bigscreen TV.<br />PROS: Cool design. Good 2.2 MP pics. Unlimited video recording. Decent optical (70mm)and digital zoom. 1 touch photo transfer. Fully automatic operation. AV (both PAL/NTSC)out. USB out.<br />CONS: Can't use zoom or flash when recording video.","I bought this camera with the docking station and I LOVE using it!  I had my digital pictures processed using Ofoto and they turned out better than regular film processing.  I had indoor and outdoor pictures processed and they both turned out marvelous.  The camera is easy to use.  Definitely purchase a memory card with this.  I just wish the zoom worked on the LCD screen instead of just in the viewfinder.  I keep it on the docking station when I am not using it and I have never had a problem with the batteries running out of power.","Did research on digitals before purchasing.  I'm only an average user that didn't need too many bells and whistles, mainly wanted one to take pictures at my beach wedding, etc.  This camera got good reviews every site I went to.  So I went out and purchased the camera, got it home, and was up and running with it instantly.  The software was easy to setup and gave me no prob's on a 200mhz celeron with 64mb, and with just the USB cable-the transfer from camera to computer was still easy.  I was totally impressed.  I've also read about short battery life.  I did buy NiMH batteries and a quick charger, but haven't had to use them yet.....the one-time Nicad's that came with the camera have been going strong for the last 5 days...and believe me, i'm putting the camera thru it's paces...this is a new toy to me, and I've taken well over 400 pic's of everything and anything to test the quality.  The picture quality is excellent, the camera is easy to use as well as the accompanying software.  This camera is a total deal and I am very happy with this purchase.","Out of the box, 10 minutes to load the battery and software, and I was taking pictures. I wanted a point and shoot that was easy. Kodac did just that, perhaps making everything to easy.<br />Good Points: extreme easy, apparent quality is good, auto adjust for low light or high daylight. Pictures look good, but yet to try it on the printer. No problem with WIN XP. User settings are saved, no need to re-set after turn on-off. Bad points: Could not integrate my email program address book.  Had to type the address manually. Note- this was direct from the Kodac program. Perhaps I have some learning to do, but this did prove to be cumbersome. Recommendation:  As point and shoot, so far so good. Will see quality when I print out on my photo quality printer.  Suspect from what I have seen, these will be OK.  Easy - yes.  Menus - easy. Instruction book - straight forward. Camera is so far everything they advertised. 2.2 MPx appears good to take the family pics.  Video mode works good, be careful, it picks up everything (sound).","I love this digital camera.  It is just great.  I take lots of photos in general via different cameras, and I find myself bringing this one everywhere.  It is the best investment if you have a new baby, for example ... it's not as pricey as other models but has all the features.  The videos are a little pixelated, but you can always pretend when your baby is older that it was old (like Super 8) technology.  In other words, I personally do not mind the mood of the video quality although I would NOT purchase this camera if that were a concern.  The photo quality on the other hand is superb.  Finally, the software needs better quality assurance.  It software crashes every time I transfer to my Windows 2000 Pro system (and also on Win NT).  It just stops in the middle of a photo.  Fortunately, there is a workaround:  Turn your camera on and off and try again.  You won't lose the photo, but will end up with a damaged dupe.  For every upload, I have 3 or 4 of these.  I upgraded the software via a website patch that took a long time to download, but it has the same problem.  If it weren't for the workaround, I'd have to say don't buy it.  But cross your fingers that this problem is just for now, until a patch comes out.","This review is for those people who don't already know a lot about digital cameras . . . . This camera made my first-time digital camera experience very pleasant. I know nothing at all about digital camera technology, so I was extremely anxious about buying and using one. Both the camera and instructions were very easy and user-friendly -- almost like a mini \"Idiot's Guide to Using a Digital Camera\" (Hey, I'll admit it). The instructions were simple and in plain language -- with lots of pictures to point out where everything goes and can be found.<br />It took about 10 minutes to figure everything out (where the battery & memory card goes, etc.), and after that I felt tremendously comfortable using it.<br />This camera went to Spain with me 2 days after I bought it; it took fabulous photos and gave me no problems at all.<br />On a 48mb memory card I managed to get 217 photos in normal mode. The 8mb internal memory that comes with the camera held 37 normal-quality photos that looked great.<br />Favorite qualities: Optional no-flash, the ability to instantly look at your photo and decide whether to keep it or not, and the ability to review your photos virtually at will. Many cameras certainly have these features, but the user-friendliness of the Kodak DX3600 took the fear out of using them for the first time.<br />Get the battery charger & batteries; it really helps.","If I were to rate this camera only on its quality of photos and ease of use, it would be a clear 5 star item. But I too had to return the first rechargeable battery pack and that video recorder part is pathetic. I hate that you can't just buy your own rechargeable batteries and expect the docking station to charge them too. (But you can still use fully charged substitutes) The camera feels a bit cheap with its plastic case but its a wolf in sheeps clothing! The photos that come out of my photosmart printer taken with this camera blew me away! The Outstanding quality of the prints easily matched those of my old wedding camera. Now I fill my albums with high quality 5x7s and larger. If your goal is a digital thats easy to use and makes outstanding photos, this one is a great choice.","The biggest selling point for me on this camera versus others in this class/price range was the unlimited (per memory) video capability, and the Kodak docking system. I was very disappointed in the video quality. I'm not a fan of QuickTime which is the format used. I am very, very impressed with the Kodak docking system, and software!<br />In the process of preparing to return the camera for one of better still photo quality, and sticking with Kodak's docking system, I found some surprises. The 3600 has a larger LED viewer than the 3700 or 3900. The 3900 has no onboard memory and the 3700 has digital zoom only. Both the 3700 & 3900 have 3.3 megapixel which goes beyond the 8 X 10 print quality compared to the 2.2 which prints only(?) 8 X 10. Neither the 3700 or 3900 have ANY video capability.<br />If you are looking to catch video only, don't buy this camera. If you are looking for quality still shots for the dollar, ease of using your computer to work with them, this IS the camera!<br />Needless to say, I will be keeping my DX3600!","After much research on digital cameras and trying them out, I purchased this camera. For the first couple of months I was very disappointed. I could not get the camera to stay charged for more than a half hour or so. Also I couldn't print my photos clearly. After several frustrating calls and emails to Kodak, I did get help with the charging problem. I could never get photos to print, however, so I purchased the Kodak Personal Photo printer. Now I love the camera, I take pictures and print them without dealing with my computer. The camera is very easy to use, the menus are easy to read and understand. My pictures come out great digitally and in print. I recommend this camera but be prepared to pay for a lot of accessories: extra memory, the dock, and possibly the Personal printer if you really want to enjoy it.","We got this because it was rated a \"Best Buy\" by a consumer magazine.  We've used a few digital cameras in the past, and this camera was by far the easiest to use.<br />The video option is great and it even captures sound!  We love making little movies of our baby.<br />Just be sure you get a big memory card to go with it, and you can take pictures and videos all day long.","This camera is a significant improvement over previous Kodak cameras. We were testing this camera for VeriPic software compatibility and were pleasantly surprised at its ease of use. We had previously used Kodak DC215, DC260, DC265, DC290 and DC5000. We were pleased with how much lighter this camera is than the DC290 as well as this camera is frugal on batteries.<br />This camera take standard or rechargable AA batteries. This will save you a lot of money in the long run. Beware of other cameras from other manufacturers that use their own battery types. The photos are crisp and sharp and the auto-focus is accurate. The colors from this camera, as is true for all Kodak cameras, appear warm and inviting. Kodak really knows how to do the color mix well! Best of all, this camera will work with VeriPic software so this camera could be used for legal or insurance work where digital photo authenticity is necessary. This is a great all around point and shoot camera.","This cmeera is almost as easy to use as a 35mm. yet it is digital. All the features are fairly easy to use and are easily explanitory. We shopped around before the purchase of a digital camera, and this is about the best in features for the money.","This camera was a real bargain.  It's very easy to use for my wife who is nervous when using digital cameras.  For, a digital camera owner and user for five years, it is great.  It has great resolution and unlike many digital cameras in this price range a pretty good flash.  I wish it had a more powerful optical zoom, but is adequate.  A 64 MB card really increases versatility, especially when shooting video.  The audio & video is impressive when you consider it comes from a still camera.","but sometimes the camera won't turn on.  It has a little door that covers the lens.  Once in a while, after turning on the camera, the little lens cover doesn't open correctly.  Often it takes several tries to get the camera to turn on properly.<br />Aside from this irritation, the camera works great.  It takes great pictures.","This camrea is easy to use and takes great pictures. the software that comes with the camera is great too. Being a man of few words let me quote Tony Tiger,\"It's Great!!!!\"","this camera takes great pictures is very easy to learn, but the battery lasted 1 day and isn't rechargable.<br />The easyshare dock comes with a rechargable battery pack, but costs another $....<br />  also, after installing the included software onto my Sony vaio laptop, the computer got very messed up and I had to reinstall the whole operating system.<br />  everything else about the camera is wonderful. It takes really good quality pictures esp. in close up mode. for a reasonable price. And it works very well with my mom's powermac G4.<br />  All in all a great camera with few, though severe, shortcomings.","I just purchased this camera, and its great!  I bought this about a week ago, and have used it on several ocassions, and it takes great pictures.  Plus it has the 2x Optical zoom!  You cant go wrong with this camera.  It hasa solid 2.2 megaPixels, plus many, many options!","I'm 11 going on 12. I have had much experience with cameras, especially Nikons. I take pictures for a local skate park, so I do know what I'm doing. Anyway, so I'm opening my presents on Christmas morning, and I get to the Digital Camera. I decide to test it without even looking at the instruction manual! It was so easy to use and the picture quality is amazing! It's picture quality is as good, possibly better, than the heavy duty Nikons I'm used to working with. The KODAK DX3600 has a darn good zoom on it too and it captures every single moment. It stores up to 50 pictures on its Internal Memory alone! It's wonderful. And the amazing part is that I never had to read the instruction manual to learn how to turn it on/off. I recommend this camera to everyone from novices to experts! Take my advice, get this camera!","Finally Kodak, the father of the family box camera arrives big in the Digital Camera Arena loaded & user friendly.<br />The DX3600 has it all and will please all, firm the casual amateur to the avid photo buff.<br />Summary:  This is Consumers Choice for a really excellent Digital Camera to have.  A great value and easy to use.  Takes great pictures and videos (320x240) with sound (NOTE: With the 2x2 LCD screen they can be reviewed, edited, copied, & deleted).  Easy down load capability to your PC with the provided software.  (NOTE: Kodak has an entire stand-a-lone System (no-PC required)to include the; Camera Dock, Personal Picture Maker 200 printer & Kodak Photo paper available see my reviews).  The DX3600 has a 2x Optical zoom (very important for true magnification without loss of detail) & hi res - 1600x1200 lines for outstanding 8x10 pictures!  Has 8MB internal memory (12 hi res pictures or 30 seconds of video w/sound).  Additional Memory can be provided by Picture Cards. (Note: I recommend a 96MB card this will provide an additional 140+ pictures!!!!  Remember you can review/edit/delete pictures as you go).  The DX3600 comes with rechargeable batteries (good for 30 - 50 pictures per charge / depending on your LCD use).  (Note: I recommend you take extra AA batteries (DX3600 uses 2)for long photo shoot outings !!!) The Camera Dock option is a great unit to include on your trips.  The DX3600 also comes with a USB cable for PC hook & an audio/video cable for TV hook-up!!!  This way you can all see immediate picture results.  (NOTE: you have a slide show feature in this camera.  This is awesome!!)<br />The quality of your pictures will improve and become outstanding the more you use the camera.  This is a versatile, easy to use, great money value and Kodak is the only Digital Camera manufacturer that provides the complete economical photo products from the camera, Photo printer w/LCD screen/direct Picture Card access, famous Kodak photo paper (Satin, Hi-Gloss finish etc.), Photo inkjet cartriges and Picture Cards up to 128MB.  This Camera is awesome and with the great price and the 2.2 megapixels is all you need!!!  Enjoy.","This is my first digital camera. I have used them in the past and am fairly familiar with the technology.<br />First, here are the requirements that I had when I went shopping/researching:<br />- Very easy to use<br />- Good battery life<br />- 2.1 megapixel<br />- Battery charger<br />- Ease of downloading<br />- Universal Serial Bus (USB)<br />This camera met all the requirements. At 2.2 Megapixels, the pictures are really good. 1200 x 1600 at max and 600 x 800 at min. I have had the camera for almost four weeks now. I guess I have taken around 500 pictures so far. I have tried all the settings.<br />At high resolution, I took Christmas pictures. I printed the pictures on a Cannon S600 printer at 4 x 6 size. The printed pictures were extremely good. We sent them out with the Christmas cards this year.<br />I bought the camera dock at the same time. This is an extremely useful add on. To download the pictures (and recharge the batteries) all you do is turn on your computer, dock the camera and press the download button on the dock. The software loads and asks where you want to put the pictures on the harddrive. Very easy.<br />I bought a 64 meg Compact Flash. At high resolution, I can get 96 pictures. At low resolution I can get 406 pictures.<br />Also, the camera has the ability to take digital video. 300 x 200 and something a bit lower. An interesting feature, but of limited use. Since the aperature is so small, you need plenty of light. The microphone is over sensitive. Anything above normal voice levels is distorted. Still, it is interesting. With the 64 meg card, I can get around 12 - 15 minutes of video at the max resolution.<br />I like the camera and have no complaints. So far, it has met or exceeded all of my requirements for an entry level camera.","To tell you the truth, the DX3600 is an absolutely great camera for the price. The first praise for the camera would have to be its image quality. The quality is excellent. I printed out an 8 by 10 photo and was utterly surprised by the detail in the picture. The optical zoom is great too, it dosen't degrade the quality of the pic at all. I wouldn't recommed using the digital zoom option. Though most people say that the flash could be stronger, I think that the flash is great. It creates the perfect lighting without burnout (Super white in the middle of the piture) like many digital cameras do. The movie mode is an awesome added bonus to the camera. You need to have good lighting to film in movie mode. I'd also recommend getting at least a 32mb flash card. With it, you can take up to 49 highest quality pictures. The menus of the camera are simple, making the camera easy enough to use to where a 7 year old could operate it. It's the perfect family camera. The battery life is about 150 pictures with RAYOVAC 1600mAh rechargeable batteries. The camera is made of plastic, yet I'm surprised at how sturdy it is. I was carrying much things in my hands including the camera when the camera fell 3 or 4 feet onto my tile floor. I examined it an found no scratch, dent or crack. I then tried it out and it still worked like a charm. Thank you Kodak.<br />My only complaint for this camera is that it induces much noise into the picture when the flash is not used in low light conditions.<br />Overall, I think that this camera deserves a 5 star rating for its ease of use, quality, and durability.","I got this camera a few days before a Disney vacation.  It didn't take long to learn how to use it and took great pictures! The movie mode is great for fast action like rides, when a still frame doesn't capture it all, but they do use a lot of memory.  I would suggest a 128mb card to make sure you have plenty of room.  The battery is great because its rechargable, with the dock, but keep a spare set with you in case it runs out of power.  I'm guessing 50 to 100 pics on the battery, but it also uses a lot of power if the LCD is on a lot or if you review and delete a lot.  Downloading at the touch a a button is awesome, especially if you have over 400 pictures to download.  Any other way, you would sit at the computer for hours! It's great not to have to reload film all the time. I only wish I had bought it sooner!","First, the quality of the pictures is excellent.  The videos with sound take some practice to make look and sound good.  We got a 64 MB CF type 1 card and rarely fill it all the way up (using highest quality settings).  A good camera for the price - no real complaints except as noted below.<br />I have experienced the battery problems mentioned by other owners.  For some reason, the camera looks at the fully charged 1.2 volt NiMH battery and thinks it's not fully charged (Lithium and Alkaline batteries are 1.5 volts each).  I was never able to get stand alone AA NiMH batteries to work.<br />If you have a dock, this seems to help:  Place the camera on the dock and wait for the light to go from red to green.  Repeat the process several (around 5 or 6) times (remove the camera and replace it on the dock, wait for the light to go from red to green).  I can now shoot 40 meg of movies and take 10 pictures with flash with no battery problems.","Well, let me start off by saying, I am no camera expert, and this is my first digital one.  I must say however, I am quite impressed!  There are various types of flashes, such as the red eye flash.  It didn't take me long to figure out, and the instructions manual was not needed.  There are 2 minor cons: The picture showed on the cameras screen looks a little different than what it looks like on the computer, which probably caused me to delete a few good pictures.  Also, this thing eats up batteries very quickly, unless you buy a special kind that the camera comes with.  I do recommend this camera to anyone who likes quality digital pictures at a unbelievably low price!","I ordered this camera after reading the reviews here at Amazon and I am glad to order it. In general, the camera is very good and the price is good too. Kodak did a good job. The quality of the pictures are very good outdoor, but a little dark indoor but still very good too if you have the lights on at home. I beleive the camera needs a stronger flash. I found the movie feature is very good. You can make movies with sound. The problem is that you can't make movies indoor unless you have a strong light (the movies I made indoor  came up to be dark unless all lights are on). No problem with the quality of outdoor movies. The camera is extreemly easy to use with lot of features. There are lot of optional accessories for this camera. The best are the 37mm wide-angle length and the telephoto lens.  The battery life is also very good. I have a friend who has the Olympus DC510, and I found out the quality of pictures for the Kodak and the Olympus are similar.  However, Kodak camera has the movie feature, lot of more optional accessories and also cheaper. In general, I would recommend this camera to anyone.","The DX3600 is the best camera out there for it's price. Excellent photos. Video is not that great unless you have excellent lighting (outside). The Dock sometimes seems to get confused, but the battery life is good. I don't understand other people's complaints about the battery life. I have been able to fill the camera with pictures without a battery problem.","It's simple to use point and click, and it produces good quality pic's.  I love not having to develop the film, and not having to wait until all 24 shots have been taken to look at the snap shot. Now I can shoot as many pictures as I want, and develop only the good ones - or none at all. I loaded the pictures into webshots.com screensaver, and everyone who comes over to the house sits and stares at it - it's great. When the camera is plugged into the USB port on my computer it automatically runs the appropriate software, and all that's needed is to click the button that say's \"transfer now\". The ability to take digital movies is a plus - the movies are a bit grainy even on high resolution setting, but it's more than I was expecting. I put the digital pic's and movies on our web site. I also sent some into ofoto.com to be developed.  They turned out nice although quite a bit darker than what we see on the monitor. But you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between them and a 35mm pic - no grain. The batteries that came with it died after about 200 shots + several minutes of movies, and plain old AA's are not cutting it - they don't seem to have enough power. It's not perfect, but overall we're very pleased with it and we're having a lot of fun.","I recently gave up my old polaroid pdc-700, that I got for christmas, I wish I knew then what I know now about cameras.  My mom had picked out a digi cam for me that died x-mas night, so I returned it to wal-mart and picked up the polaroid ... I figured it would be a nice entry level camera.  it had some nice features and took decent pics for what I did with it, but we had a family reunion that changed all that.  The thing just ate up the batteries i was using, all 4 of them! and sometimes the lcd took its sweet time to come on.  Dissapointed with the purchase I sold it off to my aunt.  I got myself this dx3600 and all I can say is OMG! GREAT.  This camera is really awesome, the software is linear, and easy to use.  The controls are big and the documentation is good, pics are crisp and clear, and movie mode is a +.  I bought a 128mb CF card for it >:D soooo it will definately come in handy this weekend on my trip to dallas for quakecon! definately a great bang for the buck.","I`ve had the camera for a week now and I`m pleased overall.It takes great outdoor pictures,but quality drops a bit on indoor pictures.They seem to come out a little grainy if the lighting isn`t just right.The video mode is a big plus!You need to add a flash card to really enjoy this feature though.The 8 meg internal memory just isnt enough to use this feature.I picked up a 64 meg flash card for 60 bucks and now it can handle up to 15 minutes of video recording.I just wish kodak would have included a little video editing prgram in the software.It would be better to be able to edit my own movies.I guess I`ll end up buying a little video editing program if I can find one cheap.But overall,I would reccommend this camera for it`s overall features and price!","For close up shots, it ...stinks, all my pictures are fuzzy.","Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase of this camera - it's handsome (got lots of compliments on its looks), lightweight -- the thing's a veritable feather, comparatively -- takes superb outdoor shots, and pretty good indoor shots (although insufficient lighting, as with most digitals, affects quality).<br />Digital zoom - as with most cameras - BAD!.  The DSP is \"guessing\" what pixels belong where.  Fortunately the DX3600 has 2x _optical_ zoom (alas, the little sister model DX3500 does not).  You can go to 6x with digital zoom, (and the .1x the zoom stepping is nice), but you'll start to see blurriness, pixellation, and x-mas lights effects.  Up to 2x looks great.<br />The movie mode is such a fun feature... great for those times when a picture just isn't enough.  The DX3600 records at 320x240 or 160x120, 20fps(!), with audio!  And limited only by your memory capacity (I can get up to 15 minutes on my 64MB card).  You can't use zoom or flash when recording, so lighting is a concern; but I've taken movies of a Japanese sushi chef slicing an egg with his spatula in low hotel restaurant light, and it came out beautifully!  :)<br />The software blue-screened Windows 2000 on me twice during installation (which NEVER happens... my W2K system is a ROCK)... although it has worked perfectly during regular use. (or else the camera would have been returned already!)  When plugged in to the USB cable, you can use the Kodak software, or the camera simply appears as a drive under My Computer.  Nice!<br />This camera has MADE me a shutterbug!  I didn't even own a film camera before this purchase.  And on my recent trip to San Francisco, I snapped 275+ pics & movies!<br />The beautiful LCD screen (viewable even in bright sunlight), ease of use (the ultimate in point and shoot!), good battery life -- I recommend the 1600mA Rayovac NiMHs -- great macro shots, video out (how many \"low-end\" cameras have that?), and very nice-looking photos (what we're all after, in the end!)  You get a lot of camera (and mini-camcorder!) for the money!","Well I got my new Kodak DX3600 yesterday ( as I mentioned it's  a replacement for my Sony DSC-S70 digital camera - yes I down graded from a $600 camera !!) and started playing with it. IMHO a digital camera's ability to take close-up photos is a good indication of the overall quality of the camera ( based on the premise that ALL digital cameras can take decent photos of people, buildings, cars, etc ). The first picture I took in macro mode 6X is shown at ... ... and a picture of a quarter  and for what I want to use the camera for it's a good quality picture ( both pictures have been cropped and reduced ). The focal distance to an object in macro mode has to be between 10\" and 24\" with the DX3600 where other more expensive cameras you can get closer because of a high quality lens. Kodak does make 5X & 12X close up lenses ( which can be piggybacked to 17X ) for about $35 which would greatly increase the effective close up range of the camera and detail of the pictures. I plan on ordering the close-up lens kit shortly. Tomorrow I plan on getting out and trying my hand at \"normal\" shots and see how they look - from the examples at the review page at Steve's Digicams it appears to be very effective in that respect. This camera has 8MB of internal memory - with additional memory being supplied by compactflash modules. Another nice feature of the camera is it's ability to take full motion video clips! All in all for the price it's a nice entry level 2.2 megapixel digital camera. Why did I go from a Sony to Kodak - well the Sony had too many bells and whistles ( I am no macho-techno nerd when it comes to cameras and I want nothing to do with fooling with f stops and all the other settings) for what I need to do with a camera ( maily take photos for ... and outdoor photographs while traveling ) the Kodak seems to be exactly what I need AND the price was right.","I've used Kodak digital cameras before (a DC-260 at work) and this one was a surprise. I bought it sight unseen, based on some excellent reviews. Even though the DX3500 has been out for a few months, the optical zoom and movie capability was enough to make me wait for the DX3600.<br />My first reaction was that the DX3600 was too light to be a serious camera. My first hi-res 8x10 print was enough to change my mind. The outdoor color saturation was very good. Indoor with the builtin flash is suitable for snapshots only.<br />The 8MB builtin memory will hold 10 hi-res or 40 low res photos. You'll want to pick up a 48MB or larger CF card. The internal memory is not cumulative with the flash card, but there is a way to copy photos from one to the other.<br />Buy the docking station. Yes, it's way overpriced. You get a rechargable battery set which is much better than the expensive lithium AAs that come with the camera. (The docs say that alkalines won't work well). Even more important is how easy the docking station makes transfering photos. Very similar to a Palm hotsync.","I really really want to like this camera!  I started off with the Dx3500 and then I found out Kodak released an updated version of the same camera, I traded my Dx3500 in for the Dx3600 model.  They both are pretty much the same except the Dx3600 has a 2x optical zoom and can make movies complete with audio.  As long as you dont use the 2x optical zoom, your pictures come out very nice.  It is when you start zooming in is where you run into problems.  Every picture that I have ever taken with the zoom has been out of focus.  The movie mode is picky. Sometimes it gives you a nice clean movie, other times it is out of focus as well.  If all you need are nice pictures, I would stick with the Dx3500.  The Dx3600 is just way to picky!  If anyone has any better luck with this camera, I would love to hear about it!....","DX3600 is a very cool digital camera.  It captures not only still pictures, but it also captures video and sound.  However, the internal 8M memory will be full very quickly when using video capturing.  Picture quality is not bad.  Indoor pictures are a little bit dark.<br />I didn't buy the camera dock.  The transfer is still pretty easy without the dock.  Just connect the USB cable to the camera and the computer will start the transfer program.  I spent the money to buy a charger with 4 AA NiMH batteries instead.  The camera actually uses 2 AA batteries only.<br />The software comes with the camera is pretty basic.  I am looking for a better image editing software.<br />The camera does not ship a hard copy manual.  You need to print it out from CD yourself."]},{"name":"Kyocera Finecam S3 / Yashica Finecam S3","amazon_reviews":["This camera was purchased to replace the S3 3MP I purchased in 2001 that was recently stolen out of our vehicle.

Works perfect.","As I use digital cameras since they came out for business and private and thus buy at least one camera a year, I have seen a lot. My conclusion: If you want it all, buy a Sony! I have an S85, but the S70/S75 is nearly as good. The DSC-P1 would be my next choice, but Sony seems to have discontinued it. Strange.<br />If you want small, the S3 is as good as it gets. The picture quality is EXCELLENT and nearly matches the Sony. If you like to spend full days taking photographs, this one is not for you. The battery takes several hours to charge and there is no display to tell you when it is done! The rechargable battery lasts really for half an hour. But that will allow you to fill a 64MB stick with 30-60 high quality snapshots depending on the mode. The tiny flash and only a 2x zoom say it all.<br />This is the ideal camera to carry around ALWAYS, for which the Sony is too big. If you go on a photo trip buy a Sony S85. The Kyocera S3 is not perfect. But there has to be a tradeoff between size and features. You can't have it all!","This is the ideal camera for me.  I was looking for a digital camera that was very small, so that lugging it around would not be a chore.  I wanted a camera that was very easy to use, high-resolution, and under ....  This camera fits the bill perfectly.<br />Nice features:<br />I like the storage medium --<br />It comes with a 16 MB MMC card; that's a little small, so I bought a 64 MB card as well.  (It would be nice if you could select the card memory size as an option, so that you don't end up with an extra one you don't need...)  To transfer pictures to the PC, you put the memory card into the provided USB card reader, and the pictures just show up as files in Windows Explorer.  Couldn't be simpler.<br />The controls are fairly intuitive to use --<br />There is a 3-setting switch to go between Set Up/Review Pictures/Take Pictures modes.<br />There are 2 buttons for zooming in/out.<br />When reviewing pictures, the zoom in button zooms in on the picture in the LCD window.<br />There's a button for macro/infinite/automatic focus.<br />There's a button for flash mode: off/on/auto/fill-in.<br />The Menu button gets you to other options.<br />Pictures come out fine with the default settings --<br />There is some fine-tuning of the settings that you can do, but I have been completely satisfied with the image quality using the defaults.<br />Caveats:<br />Yes, the battery life is not spectacular.  But then, in researching cameras, I have noticed that everyone complains about the battery life on every camera.  I have found that if I just turn the camera off after each shot, the battery will last the duration of a typical outing.  To recharge, you plug the camera into the charger; no need to remove the battery.<br />The movie mode is not very useful.  But then, I wanted a still camera, so I am not disappointed.  My digital video camera takes lousy stills, too.<br />The camera comes with this little \"hand strap\" you can attach, but I would've preferred a neck strap.  I think the hand strap just makes it more likely that you'll whack the little thing into something.  Much safer to just put it in its little bag and into your pocket.<br />The camera by default remembers your previous settings when you turn the camera on again.  This is usually what I want, but some people may find the alternate \"restore default settings\" mode to be better for them.  I have made a few mistakes when the camera turned on in High Resolution mode, or with flash off, when that is not what I expected.<br />In summary, this is a nifty little camera!","Kyocera Finecam S3<br />This is a fantastic camera! It is a great high-resolution, point-and-shoot, digital camera for the amateur photographer in a package so small that you WILL take it with you. This is my first digital camera. I borrowed a Kodak 1.3M camera, and after countless hours of research was about to buy the Cannon S20 when I saw a reference to the Kyocera Finecam S3. After some investigation I found that Kyocera is the parent company for Yashica/Contax. I am familiar with Contax because my first camera is a Contax 139 which I bought 20 years ago and have loved ever since. Contax has the exclusive license to distribute world renowned Carl Zeiss T* lenses. I wanted a digital camera that took very good pictures and was small enough that I would be willing to carry with me. I have found over the years that quite often I will not have even a point-and-shoot camera with me because I don't want to carry it. This camera is so small (the length and width of a credit card) that it easily fits in the pocket of my jeans.<br />The optics on this camera are fantastic, it takes great pictures. I bought a 64MB memory card and always shoot in the high-resolution mode because it is easy to cut a picture down later on the computer. Other than buying a larger memory card, this camera comes COMPLETE with rechargeable battery, 120/240v charger, carrying case, USB adaptor and some OK software.<br />The movie mode is pretty wimpy. It looks a bit like a 1960's home movie and there is no sound. But then again this is NOT A MOVIE CAMERA. My mother enjoys the short-grainy movies of her grandchildren. The viewfinder is small, but you can zoom in 2x and pan around when viewing a picture.<br />The con's of the camera are: 1) The battery will only last about 32-64 pictures, then you have to recharge.<br />2) The memory card that comes with it is too small. Buy a bigger one.<br />3) The flash is only good for 8-10 feet (like most point-and-shoots).<br />4) There is no setting to make the LCD panel default to OFF.<br />5) It takes about 1.5 seconds to actually take a picture. Maybe most digitals are like this.<br />6) The movie mode is only 320 X 240 and there is no sound. But remember, this is a STILL camera, not a camcorder.<br />The pro's are:<br />1) Great still pictures including macro mode.<br />2) So small that you will take it with you.<br />3) Nicely designed and built. Easy to use controls.<br />4) No nose prints on the display because it is right beneath the viewfinder.<br />5) Rechargeable battery included (although is it proprietary).<br />6) Charger is 120-240V.<br />7) Has automatic lens cover to keep the lens clean.<br />8) Options to display more or less in the LCD panel.","I was taken in by the fact that this is very small camera and takes high quality photos. Those qualities are very useful as far as they go, but I have paid a price for them. I think the size technology has reached the point of diminishing returns. The convenience of being able to plop the thing in your shirt pocket must be balanced by the detriments you don't find out till you start using it.<br />1)  The battery life is ridiculously short. Minutes after a charging the little battery icon starts shortening. There is no way to get through a full day of shooting.<br />2)  The LCD monitor is really too small to do other than loosely frame photos. Eats up battery power like a shark.<br />3)  The 15 second movie option ludicrous. The photo quality is so jaw droppingly  bad  people come from miles around to laugh at it.  Whoever designed it must be hiding out in Argentina.<br />This camera is perfect if you are so jammed up you simply can't carry it in any other than your small purse of shirt picket and you don't need many shots at one sitting.  The photo quality is excellent but the battery capacity is poor and the movie option is a hoot. I was not bothered by the relatively meager telephoto capacity.  Don't expect any flexibility at all."]},{"name":"Sony Mavica CD200","amazon_reviews":["I already have on just like this.  A couple of years go I had to replace the lens and it cost me over $100 to replace.  The camera apparently has a plastic lens which sticks out to far allowing a hit of any kind to chip it.  Furthermore, the lens cover is loose and pops off every chance it gets.  The camera should have come with a rubber lens cover that would fit more securely.  I wasn't about to spend another $100 on the camera so I bought this one that was reasonably priced and is in much better shape than mine.  If it ever conks out, I will just put its lens on my old camera.","I actually love the camera! I love how many options you have when taking photos.

I want it !","I simply cannot say enough good things about this camera.<br />I got it for a three-week trip to Europe (took 700+ photos without a hitch, you can't say that about other digital image storage devices) and now I find that I am taking it everywhere!<br />I did not find the problems one previous reviewer had with vibration during \"finalization\" of the cd's. I finalized on a train, and worried about the vibration of the moving vehicle, but did not have any problems at all.

The ease-of-use, the relative cheap expense of the storage device (I forgot a CD on a recent junket and just bopped into a local office store to purchase a disc for about $3) and the optical quality of the camera makes this a great investment for someone who wants a good, solid camera to accompany you across town or around the world.","Wow! Leave it up to Sony to show that just as the digital camera market had just appeared to \"flame-out\", no, wait, there's still new directions to go. Though you may never use them all, this camera has every feature you ever wanted in a camera for a price that stays below four figures.<br />My one question though: Why didn't Sony just come out with these instead of the FD Mavicas? Not that there's anything really wrong with them (they seem to come from a similar philosophy, after all), but it makes you wonder.<br />With that out of the way: This is a great camera, well worth the price tag. I also reccommend getting the CD Mavica starter kit, primarily for the extra battery & carry case, because once you get it, you'll never want to leave it behind you.","I researched digital cameras for six months before buying the Sony MVC-CD200. The CD is what sold me on this one. I didn't want to have to deal with USB connections and special software just to view my pictures. I was also worried that whatever digital camera I bought might become quickly outdated. I don't think that's going to happen with the Sony CD cameras. This is an absolutely incredible camera for both serious and casual photographers. I'm an artist and had wanted to be able to take daily pictures of my work in progress, as well as reference photos. For me, this is the ultimate. The 2.1 megapixels provide photos that are actually superior in many ways to the ones I've taken with my film cameras. For instance, I can see thickness of paint, brush strokes and a full range of color in my paintings. I haven't even bothered to install the software that Sony provides with the camera. All I do is finalize the CD, pop it into the CD-ROM and pull up the pictures either through Microsoft Publisher 2000 or Quark Express. One disc easily stores 70 pictures shot at maximum file size of 1600-1200. I don't think I'd really want more than that on one disc because it makes looking through all of them faster. I print them on an HP Deskjet 1220C using their premium photo paper. I've been amazed at the results I've been able to get indoors with no flash. For instance, I took one of the light from a single lamp in a room on an overcast morning. Gorgeous. The camera is very easy to use. I would recommend going through the manual at some length to take full advantage of all it can do. I really think the Sony CD cameras represent a breakthrough in digital photography for a wide range of people.","I purchased this camera a month ago, and at first I loved it.  It does take great pictures, there's no arguing that.  However, the CD \"feature\" can be a bit of a nightmare, especially if you take a lot of \"quick\" pictures and want to view them on your PC immediately.<br />Here's the problem: unless you install the Sony USB drivers (which are quite finicky with Windows 2000; one install corrupted my ATAPI drivers effectively disabling my DVD & CD-RW drives), you are required to \"finalize\" a disc before inserting it into your computer.<br />The finalize process takes approximately 1 minute, and \"eats\" 13MB of your 156MB disc.  You can finalize many times, however, each finalize (even if it's only one picture) consumes 13MB of disc space.  And, be sure you don't \"disturb\" the camera while it's finalizing the disc.  ANY vibration/bump/movement will render the disc useless; I've got 2 small coasters because my cat happened to jump on the desk while the camera was finalizing itself.  Mind you, the cat didn't bump the camera - just the vibration through the desk caused it to generate a fatal finalize error (and, our cat is only 7lbs).<br />It does have some high-points like macro mode, a relatively good f-stop range (f2.8 - f11) which makes for great low-light shooting, and it's very easy to use, hold, take along.<br />If Sony could build some good, reliable drivers, I wouldn't be complaining about the finalize feature, as I wouldn't use it much.  However, because they don't seem to support Win2K fully (their website stinks for getting drivers from too), I'm hesitant to suggest this camera to anyone.<br />The drivers seem to work ok on my Win98 boxes, but my webserver runs Win2K, so I had hoped to upload the pics directly to my server.<br />Not a bad camera, but I'd consider flash card versioned cameras if I were to purchase again.","I have never written a review, and always wondered what kind of person would take the time to write. Here I am taking the time to write because this camera is the BEST camera I have ever owned -- bar none. Loaded with the features you need to take great shot -- its worth taking a few minutes to read the manual. This camera takes the best pictures ever. I selected the camera for the cd writing capability and have not been disappointed. You can pop the cd's in any computer anywhere for instant access; or just throw the cd's in a drawer for a rainy day. Last point: i was concerned about 2 megapixels, but have found the image quality to be more than ample. I cant say enough good things about this camera!","After spending several weeks researching the digital camera market I finally settled on the Mavica CD 1000. The only problem was it was a whole lot more camera than I really needed. So what does Sony do? They bring out the CD-200. Problem solved. Still more camera than I really needed but boy, what a camera!! I've been using my new 200 for a little over a month now and am just as impressed and excited with it as I was on the first day. It has almost all of the features of the CD1000, even the ability to take short MPEG movies, without the extra weight and size. Image quaity, ease of use, features, flexibility.... it's got it all. Much smaller than the 1000, even my 7 year old son has no problem handling it. The viewfinder screen is sharp, clear, and easy to see in almost all lighting conditions. The only exception is very dark flash conditions and the built-in twilight light takes care of that.<br />As with the 1000, the CD storage makes digital photography effortless. Transfering pictures using your CDR-RW drive or the USB cable is a no-brainer. Sony's CD's are a little pricy but Memorex's Pocket CD's work just as well, and their capacity is a little bigger. While on vacation I was able to get 165 large image (1600x1200) shots at high resolution on a single CD. The 5-pack of Memorex CD's cost about $1.80 ea vs 6 rolls of film at $5-6 ea plus processing. Using this camera has actually saved me money in film and developing.<br />As with the 1000 there is a lag time between pressing the button and taking the photo. Pressing the button to Half-Shutter and waiting for your picture pretty much solves that. Excellent zoom, the manual says the image degrades the more zoom you use but I can't tell the difference. The picture quality is still excellent. Battery life is about 2-1/2 hours of shooting time. Carrying an extra battery will keep you shooting from dusk to dawn and then some. Sony has a camera that has taken point and shoot to point, shoot and print.

Storing the pics on cdr's & cdrw's is very convenient & easy to access no matter what computer I'm using. It takes great pics in all lighting situations. bright & lo light turn out great! I took a pic in my kitchen with the light streaming in from the right & normally with my old camera I'd have never got the shot, it was one of the greatest pics I've ever taken. Portrait shots are wonderful too. I took another pic of my daughter that you would have thought was taken in a studio. & Printing the pics, Wow! these photos are beautiful on paper!! Even 8\" X 10\" pict turn out great!  The camera is easy to use & once you get used to all the options it's very easy to manuver from one thing to the next. I've had a lot of fun using the mpeg movie & clip modes.  They are easy to use & it's neat to play back right on the camera.  Go ahead & get the Starter kit that comes with the camera. You'll want to have the extra battery, case, & discs. I've also purchased the portable battery charger.  I like that much better for charging my empty batteries.  when charging the battery hooked up in the camera you can't use the camera to take pics.  I've been using offbrand discs, not the sony's & have had great success with them. Check out cdroutlet (online) for plastic sleeves (50 for 3 bucks) & jewel cases (30 cents ea) they also have cdrw's for 1.10ea & cdr's too. I have an old cdrom drive & was unable to read cdrw's but, it does read the cdr's. (it's about 4 yrs old, time for a new drive) I've tried my cdrw's in 3 other friends computers & they worked fine in theirs. When I'd heard a few complaints about the size & weight of the camera I was expecting it to be really big when I received it. On the contrary. I think it's fine, not too big & not really heavy either. All around you just can't go wrong with this camera, it's easy to use, takes fabulous pictures, & the media is so handy. Hope this was helpful. I think you'll love the camera!","What can I say,,,this camera is the best.  Just a pleasure to use.  Great features, takes a bit to get onto remembering how to get to each function, but that is easily overcome once the camera has been used a few times.  So quick to download, and the picture quality,,,UNREAL.... Anyone out there,,,...buy this camera,,you WON'T regret it!!!!!!..","... I, too, love this camera and pretty much agree with everyone else. This is the best purchase I've made in quite some time, so I'm just going to provide some information that I wish I'd had before I ordered the camera.<br /> The camera is fairly bulky. It's pretty much what you'd expect for a device with a built in CD writer but, when compared to other digital cameras, this thing's pretty big. I personally think that the benefits of writing the picture to a CD more than outweigh the minor inconveniences of a larger camera, but you should probably go to a local store that carries one and see if the size will bother you. Didn't bother me much at all.<br /> The delay in taking the picture can be annoying at times. Yes, there is a delay BETWEEN pictures as well (a more pronounced delay, in fact) due to the camera writing the image to the CD, but there's also a lesser talked about delay for even the very first picture. You need to hold the button halfway down for the camera to focus properly, and then wait 'til the camera tells you it's ready before you can take the picture. There isn't much of a wait, but there IS one and it can be aggravating at times. This particular delay, however, as far as I know, is common to ALL digital cameras, so I'm assuming that a digital camera just isn't a very good option for taking pictures that require split-second timing.<br /> You will probably want a case for this camera. The lens DOES have a cap, but the display doesn't and can be scratched fairly easily.<br /> You'll probably also want an additional battery and separate charger if you're more than an occasional user. The battery lasts about 90 minutes (without flash) and has a built-in chip that tells the camera how much time is left ... a pretty nice feature that's displayed for all to see in picture taking mode.<br /> I've seen mixed reviews on the CD-R / CD-RW debate. I have used the CD-RW discs exclusively so far and haven't had any problems. One thing you should be aware of is that you can't go back and erase the pictures on the discs selectively. You CAN erase the last picture taken (if using CD-RW media) and replace it with your very next picture, but you can't go back further than one picture. Well, to be more specific, you ARE allowed to go back and erase a picture older than your last one, but it won't gain you any more disc space.<br /> You CAN, of course, erase the whole disc and use it again whenever you wish (again, if using CD-RW), but you just can't go back, let's say, five pictures, erase one picture, then expect the disc space to increase enough to allow more pictures than it would have had if you'd left that picture on the disc.<br /> The camera often takes dark pictures. I've found that the picture is normally of better quality if I force the flash ... even in fairly well lit areas. There may be another technical tweak that would accomplish the same thing, but I'm an extreme novice when it comes to photography.<br /> It's VERY hard to find cases to protect these little discs! I have yet to find one. When buying these little discs, you usually have a choice of approximately 50 CD-R's on a spindle, or approximately 10 Mavica CD-R's in little cases ... both cost roughly the same price, but you can't seem to find protective sleeves or cases for the ones with a spindle. Not exactly a deal breaker, but annoying nonetheless.<br /> One disc holds about 81 pictures at the highest quality (which is absolutely breathtaking), and over 1000 at the lowest quality (which you will probably NEVER want to use).<br /> If you have a good printer, print the picture on photo quality paper, and use the highest quality setting, I don't think you'll be able to tell the difference between that picture and an actual photograph.<br /> I am an EXTREME novice at photography and I have taken some stunning pictures with the default settings, but this camera also has a dizzying array of manual settings for even the most advanced photographer.<br />I couldn't seem to easily find what out what this camera was SUPPOSED to come with, so that's what I'm supplying.<br />Camera.<br />One battery.<br />Lens cap.<br />Adaptec Direct CD software.<br />MGI Photo software.<br />USB cable for connection to computer.<br />Power supply for the camera (used to charge the battery).<br />8cm adapter to put the mini-discs into a regular drive.<br />Manufacturer warranty (I think it's one year, may be 90 days).<br />One CD-R media.<br />One CD-RW media.<br /> Well that's about what I wanted to know when I was thinking of buying this camera. Hope this review helps.","I have owned this camera for just a short time and have much to learn.  However, the results achieved with this camera are amazing.  It is so versatile and results on automatic settings are great.  The photo quality on maximum print size are the best.  I am anxious to get into manual aperture, shutterspeed, and flash settings, but that will come later.  The greatest feature, of course, is the mini-CD media on which images are recorded. I will be travelling shortly, will have no computer available for download, so all I have to do is carry a pack of inexpensive mini CDR's or CDRW's and do all downloading for editing with MS \"Picture It\" after I get home.  The original CD's can serve as archive media after downloading to desired folders on hard disk. The use of the more expensive mini CDR allows removal of \"bad\" results to gain disk space, but I will probably stay with CD-R media and just shoot away!","This is my first digital camera, and I just love it.  What attracted me to it was the fact that I can use and reuse the inexpensive CD-RWs, its picture clarity and macro features.<br />I took it on vacation and I use around town, and I love the clarity of the pictures.  I don't think I'll be using my 35mm film camera.  I've taken hundres of pictures in the two months I've owned it.  I've displayed them on the computer & on the television and made CD albums.  It has lots of features but it's not difficult to use.  I saw complaints about its size but I don't find it too large nor too heavy.  With no eye viewfinder, I've gotten used to the using only the LCD though.  However, it is difficult to use in a very sunny environment.<br />Overall, I rate the camera GREAT!","I find this camera to be the best I've ever owned or used.  I find myself using it more than I ever use my 35mm and digital video combined.  I love taking lots of pictures, and with this, I can get hundreds per CD.  This lets me be as creative as I can be, without worry about not having enough film or stick memory.  CDs are inexpensive, and quick and easy to format and use.  I can get 5-10 CDs for the price of 1 good roll of film.  You can also get accessories like wide-angle and telephoto lenses.<br />I'm glad to see that there are more options for getting the media.  I've owned the camera since August, and at first could only find the mini CDs on-line.  Now I can get them at local business supply or computer stores.  I recommend the CD-RW to get the most out of the media.  Take the pictures you want; load pictures to your computer; burn the ones you want to keep to a large CD; and then re-use the mini CD-RW.<br />The only con I had was that it took a while to get used to the display and not a viewfinder.  Now I find it easier to frame my photos.","I have owned my cd300 for about 3 weeks and have already taken 700 plus pictures.  I am so glad I waited to buy a digital -- the ability to store to a CD and then reuse the media is unbeatable!  I have had an occasional problem with the camera not booting up and telling me to turn it off and then on again.  It has something to do with the lens because the manual says it only happens to the 300 and when I called Sony tech support the guy tried to tell me the battery was faulty -- and it wasn't.  Otherwise it is a great camera.  Picture quality is comparable to my Minolta X700 35 mm SLR.  I highly recommend it!","... I think the 300 is almost perfect. However there a couple things that could have been done better so I'm focusing on the negatives here.<br />Things that won't be fixed:<br />... I dislike the write time for each picture. The run time for a battery is not long enough. At best you'll get about an 1 1/2 hours. Part of the problem is that the lcd is the only way to view. It has a switch to shut off the backlight, but even on the sunniest days, you can barely see your subject with the light off.<br />Interchangeable lens would have been nice. You can get some attachments, but truly interchangeable lens would be better.<br />There are some irritating aspects as well. I find that the natural grip causes me to touch the lcd and leave thumb prints on it all the time. I often find that I've mysteriously set the macro button. I've taken a few pictures in macro mode without realizing it. The most irratating is that Sony harasses you for not buying their expensive media (about 6-8 times more costly than the good ones I buy elsewhere). Everytime you turn on the camera you get the message \"Sony recommends Mavica CDs only\" or some such thing.<br />Things Sony could fix:<br />My biggest complaint is that it doesn't come with a cover for the LCD. I primarily bought the camera to carry around on bike trips and I keep it in my front handlebar bag. The lcd is already pretty bady scratched from bouncing around inside the bag.<br />The battery charger that comes with it is pretty inconvenient. You need to open a little door to plug in the cord. That little plastic door isn't too sturdy. A better idea would have been to give you a charger like the cheaper one they sell that you could also plug into the camera. I bought the charger and a second battery and am a lot happier. The new charger is also more portable.<br />Like I said up front, I'm pleased with the camera. I plan on taking it on a cross country bike ride and anticipate a small stack of CDs will last me. I'd recommend the MVCD300 to anyone who won't find the above quirks too bothersome.","I was at a party last night and someone had this camera.  It appears to be easy to use, shows immediate response to pictures taken, small and easy to handle.  Seemed pretty incredible to me.","I agree with all the positive statements from other reviewers.  Outstanding camera.  Only downside you should be aware of is the relatively long write time to transfer image to cd at high resolution.  During this time the camera isn't usable.  There's also a 3 picture at a time mode, which is a clever feature, but writing to cd takes even longer in this mode.  I found myself frustrated at times wanting to take the next picture and waiting for the write to finish.","After looking for 6 months at Digital camera's, I finally found the MVC-CD300 and am so happy with all the features and ease of operation. The quality of the 8x10 print was excellent. The comments from my friends was \"WOW\" that's amazing. I think CD Digital is the future. I'm glad I waited long enough to fing this Camera.","Sony's CD300 is one of the easiest cameras I have ever used.  It was a short time from opening the box to being able to point and shoot high quality images and to store these images in large quantities.  I read criticism of the size of this camera.  It is not a big camera to handle.  The biggest problem is keeping greasy fingers off of the LCD screen.  You will want to add the hood viewer option if you plan on working outside in bright sunlight or if you want more control over framing your images.  You can use the camera in an automatic exposure mode or take manual control.  The read-only storage gives you the same picture taking capabilities as any film camera.  The read-write capability gives you the added ability to remove and reshoot.  The camera stores at least as quickly as other Mavicas and you have the ability to take burst shots in groups of three.  So unless you are making a still frame movie of rabbits racing, you should find no problems using the Sony CD 300.","Tired of just taking 20 photos and then having to go home and tranfer th pictures to you computer. Well the sun has finally risen over the horizon of digital cameras. This camera uses an 88 cent 8cm mini cd for its film. You get to take 99 pictures per disc at its highest resolution in the least compressed jpg mode. Each picture is around 1.2 megabytes in fine compression max resolution. You can even take uncompressed photos if you want maximum clarity at print sizes over 8x10 with only 9 megabytes used up per picture. Try that with a dimage 7!!!<br />The ability to make 15 second 320x240 mpeg 1 movies is cute. the other format for moving pictures is a multi image gif file. sony calls it clip mode. point your web browser at it to see the frames fly by, just like all those moving ads do it<br />After you buy this camera you should also get a S70 adapter, 52mm lens protector (UV filiter), and a 52mm lens cover (the one that comes with the camera is not 52mm. A .8 netural denisty would also come in handy for those wide apeture blured background shots in the daytime. Since this camera has such a fantastic manual white balance forget about buying the FL-D and the rest of the light correcting filters. just put in one touch mode, point it at your scene and volia the colors look ok.<br />After using it for a few short vacations i discovered i prefered cd-r discs. With a cd-rw you can only reclaim space on the disc if you erase the last photo taken. otherwise its no different then a cd-r unless you want to wipe the whole thing clean with a format. the only benifit of cd-rw is with rotate which actually rewrites over the existing image rather than burning another.<br />  The key to night shots is to put it in manual mode a=3.5 s=30 is a good starting point. Its cumbersome to keep haveing to switch back to setup mode to change the preset scene mode to a different one. The cameras brain does not automaticly use the flash when you need a fill light. you will have to waste the first photo to notice you subject is a black siluette, and force the flash for your next shot.<br />The mini cd's are becoming very popular as there are a ton of tiny MP3-CD players commig out which use em","I got my new mvcd-300 about 3 weeks ago, it is so versatile, great features, for both the semi pro and amateur alike. Takes great mpeg movies, but that part I will probably never use. Have taken over a thousand pictures, and not one was bad accept for the ones I goofed on. SO if you want a great camera, wait for this one.","Its a nice camera.  The tech support is good, they directed me in setting up the USB connection. See page 38 of the manual. One problem I have noticed is with the ACC jack which is used to connect the external flash or tripod. With only one jack on the camera, you can only connect one of these accessories at any given time. In other words, if you purchase the remote tripod and the external flash, you can not shoot a picture using both the flash and remote handle on the tripod at the same time. There should have been either, two jacks or a dual connector. Before you try using a \"y\" connector, I have already been warned by Sony that \"it won't work\". I have had a nightmare of a time in ordering accessories through Sony. They are having serious problems getting the order information straight. Two orders have been fouled up and about two and one-half hours of my time wasted on the telephone. They do not correct orders that they mess up; you have to reorder and just bite the bullet. Otherwise its a good purchase except that they could have had a hot foot so you could use an alternative external flash instead of theirs which can only be connected by its cable into the single ACC camera jack, which you thought you could plug their tripod into.","I WAS FASCINATED WITH MY FRIENDS SONY DIGITAL CAMERA DURING A MINI VACATION IN FLORIDA THIS JULY,2001. SHE SHOWED ME HOW TO TAKE PICTURES AND TO REVIEW THE SHOTS IMMEDIATLY AFTER TAKING THEM ON THE SMALL SCREEN AND HOW TO ERASE IT IF I DIDN'T WANT IT...WOW!!! HOW GREAT... SHE SHOWED ME THE FLOPPY'S TO USE INSTEAD OF FILM AND I WAS SOLD ON THE CAMERA...IT SEEMED I COULD HANDLE A DIGITAL CAMERA...(I HAVE FELT INTIMIDATED WITH THE DIGITALS)I FELT I NEEDED TO START WITH SOMETHING MUCH SIMPLER..... I HANDLED THAT ONE VERY WELL...UPON MY RETURN HOME I RECEIVED THE E-MAIL PICTURES FROM FLORIDA.......WHAT GREAT SHOTS...I COULD NOT GET OVER THE CLARITY THE COLORS..I KNEW IN MY HEART THAT I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HAVE A CAMERA LIKE THAT ONE FOR MY NEXT TRIP TO EUROPE WHICH WAS IN FOUR DAYS......MY HUSBAND AND I DID SOME RESEARCH ON LINE AND FOUND THIS NEW SONY MAVICA-CD 300 WITH 3.3 PIXELS AND A MINI DISC INSTEAD OF A FLOPPY THAT COULD BE BURNED ON A REGULAR DISC AND ALSO SHOOTS SOME ONE TO FOUR MINUTES OF VIDEO.AND THE DISCS CAN TAKE FROM 100 TO 1000 IMAGES DEPENDING ON THE RESOLUTION YOU SET THE CAMERA ON. I BOUGHT THE CAMERA THE DAY BEFORE I LEFT TO EUROPE....I TOOK SUCH WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL PICTURES AND VIDEOS IN GERMANY, THE SWISS ALPS AND VENICE.ITALY..I HAD TAKEN ONLY ONE BATTERY AND 3DISCS BUT WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER BATTERY AND MORE DISCS IN A SONY WAREHOUSE IN A MALL IN ITALY...TODAY MY FRIEND IN GERMANY WHO HAPPENS TO BE A PILOT FLYER IN THE US ARMY IS CRAZY ABOUT THE CAMERA KEPT THE BURNED DISCS OF MY PICTURES AND IS LOOKING FOWARD TO BUYING ONE.I AM STILL LEARNING THE OTHER CAMERA FEATURES. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA TO A BEGINNER OR ADVANCED PHOTOGRAPHER. IT HAS VERY EASY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS..I AM SO HAPPY AND THRILLED WITH MY NEW SONY MAVICA-CD 300 CAMERA....I HAVE FINALLY BOUGHT THE PERFECT DREAM CAMERA ..","First of all, let me say I'm not a professional or even semi-pro photographer. I wouldn't know an f-stop if it landed on me. That being said, I love this camera. It's extremely easy to use. I bought mine in Tokyo, so the manuals were of course in Japanese (which I don't read or speak) but I still figured out the camera with no problems. If you can figure out something without a manual you can read, then the thing wasn't very complicated. The pictures are fantastic, in my opinion. The cd-rw works very well. You have to initialize the disc, then finalize it to be read in your computer's cd-rom. With cd-rw discs you can then unfinalize them in the camera to store more pictures on the disc. Each of these procedures take a couple of minutes, and you have to sit the camera on a flat surface and not move it during that time. If you use plain cd-r discs, you can't unfinalize them. I've read that some cd-rom drives have difficulty reading from cd-rw discs, but mine had no problem. If you have an older cd-rom, you might have to use cd-r discs instead of cd-rw. But since you can get them for less than a dollar and store 150+ images, you're still getting a bargain compared to Memory Stick or Smartmedia prices.<br />The camera comes with one cd-rw and one cd-r disc, but will work with 80mm discs from other companies. You do get a nag-screen on the LCD saying \"Mavica discs recommended\" if you use non-sony media, but I figure that's okay with me, considering how much cheaper non-Sony discs are. P>There is very little lag time between pics, much less than I expected. 2 seconds or so, usually less. This is my first digital camera so I don't know if that's a long time compared to other cameras, but I was surprised, considering the image is being burned to a disc. However, I've read that if you use the 'uncompressed TIFF' option, it takes 30+ seconds to write the 10Mb image to the disc. The cd-rw speed is 4x.<br />One cool thing is that you can zoom in up to 5x in images that are stored in the camera, move around within the image to see the part you want, and crop the pic if you want to while it's still in the camera, no computer needed. You can hook up the AV cable to see this on your TV as you're doing it.<br />The battery recharges inside the camera - there is no external battery charger. So if you buy an extra battery, like I did, you can't charge it while you're using the camera. That's the only complaint I have, and it isn't much of a complaint.<br />For a long time serious photo hobbyists have turned up their noses at the Mavica line, but I think this should change because of this camera. 3.3 megapixels makes for excellent pictures, and the flexibility allows for a lot of control over the more advanced features. I can't recommend this camera highly enough.<br />----<br />After owning the camera for a couple of weeks, I have to make a small addition.  There is no optical viewfinder, which is a problem under dim lighting conditions.  For nighttime shots or macro work where vibration is more of a problem, you would want to use a remote control, and the only remote control available is the one built into Sony tripods.  You can get around the vibration problem by using the timer, but it would still be nice to have a wired remote control.  Those are my only nags thus far.  I would still buy the camera without hesitation.","My wife gave me my MVC-CD300 for my birthday. It arrived just in time for our 4th of July family reunion. I took 450 pictures over 5 days and had only one that was not a keeper (credit camera, not photographer). The camera allows you to not only review your shots, but to zoom up to 5X to really check out the details of the photos you've taken.  Each evening we would hook the camera up to the TV with the RCA cable (included) and set the camera on \"Slide Show\". It was so much better than I imagined, beautiful high-resolution photographs of the day automatically displayed for everyone to enjoy (and critique).  When the week was over I downloaded slide show software from CyPics and burned a CD for everyone to have all 450 pictures at a cost of less than a dollar per CD. Plus, they can insert the pictures into Word for cropping and printing with almost no effort at all. I have yet to use the USB cable since it is no problem to just use my pc's CD drive. I had planned to archive my photos on the camera's small CD, but it is so easy to copy them to the hard drive and burn a larger CD with about 800 photographs that I have gone to using the rewriteable CDs in the camera. I use the 2nd highest resolution on the MVC-CD300 and get about 150 shots per CD and they give excellent 8x10 prints.  The cost per shot (including archiving) is almost nothing, so you feel totally free to snap away. You couldn't ask for a better combination of features.","I have used several digital cameras and the Sony MVC-CD300 is the best by far.  Being able to burn a rewritable CD - at a cost of less than $5 per CD with 150MB - is a BIG advantage over memory card style cameras (a 128MB card can run a couple hundred dollars).  The electronic storage problem that I faced with memory cards no longer applies (I travel a lot and always have my camera in my hand so you can imagine the number of pictures taken).<br />I have been able to store close to 100 pictures at the highest resolution on one CD making it very easy to file, catalog and find my pictures.  I have not had the problem that the previous reviewer did in being able to delete a picture and reuse the space.  He must be using regular CDs (certainly an option) rather than the rewriteable ones.<br />It was very easy to initially set up and use and has multiple ways to get the pictures to my PC.  I usually use the USB hook-up and even use the camera as a rewriteable CD for pictures other folks send me.  When I am feeling lazy, I just plop the CD in my DVD drive which also works great.<br />With 3.3 megapixels, the picture clarity couldn't be better.  I have printed out 8 x 10s that look like they were taken by an expensive 35mm camera.  The number of options for picture sizing is also enough to satisfy any \"normal\" requirement.<br />If I had to point out one issue with the camera, it is size.  While certainly not the largest camera on the market, it is a bit bulkier than I would prefer (I like sticking a camera in my pocket and I need to use a fanny pack to carry this one around).<br />All in all, if you are looking for a camera that can take 35mm quality pictures and still stay digital, I would highly recommend this Sony.","I was about to buy CD1000 camera and I still do not know what made me wait. Most probably it was that CD1000 was first camera of it's kind and knowing SONY, I was pretty sure that they will come up with something that has more features and small. and that is exactly what I got in CD300. I am so happy with this camera as it can write on a CD-RW and is compact to take around. I am having some problems with the USB drivers. Ohter than that, this is the camera to buy. It is a little pricy but in long run, due to low cost of media, this will be a great asset.","I had been searching for a year for the best digital camera that gave me top quality images, video clips with sound, and the best possible storage capabilities since I would not have access to a computer.<br />I had settled on a camera from Epson until I saw my friend's Sony Mavica MVC-CD1000 which was the first time I realized there was a camera that burned to a CD.<br />The Sony Mavica MVC-CD300 is the newest in the line and not only gave me what I was looking for, but burned images and video to a CD.  It not only uses the CD-R but uses CD-RW!  Using the rewriteables is by no means perfect, but is definitely worth it.<br />It is definitely cheaper to pick up additional mini-CDs than purchase additional memory sticks or floppies, or purchase another piece of hardware that will allow you to download the images to a storage device (or even lugging a laptop with you).<br />The only thing I wasn't too happy with was the fact that once you took the picture it burned it to the CD.  You were not really given the chance to determine if it was a keeper, but that is just a very minor thing.<br />I'm still learning how to use it, I've only had it since July 5, but so far my friends who just purchased digital cameras a few months ago are wishing they had waited for this one."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot A20","amazon_reviews":["Great sharp pictures.

Easy to use. Convenient software and USB Interface Cable to download to your PC. Note: when downloading pics to your PC try to find folder<br />where pics have been saved ( usually they under Canon > Zoom Browser > Samples) You can later rename images how you want it instead of reference them by number as 1230-1234432.JPG<br />Cons:<br />Requires 4 AA size batteries.<br />Solution - buy only 'Lithium' batteries (I use Energizer) since AA batteries will stand only 15-20 shots.","I bought this camera factory refurbished. I chose that over the newer A40 because I didn't need movie mode, saving money was more inportant.<br />The shots this camera takes are great, the interface is clean, and it has quite a nice zoom. My favorite feature is the continous shooting.<br />The USB cable takes a little while to start working with my WinME box, as it doesn't recognize the camera on the first try. Instead I use a CF reader. I have 2 sets of 4 NiMH batteries, because all digicams have quite an appetite for power. I also got a Viking 128 meg CF card.<br />I use this camera for sports photography, especially swimming. At an outdoor pool on a sunny day, the shots are bright, sharp, and clear. The ability to shot multiple pics at once means that I can get the exact moment more easily. That's great for the dives at the beginning. However, when I used it indoors under flourescent lights, blurring occured. The shutter remained open too long for the action shots, and you have no control over the shutter. With the white balance set to flourescent, indoor pics do come out clear, as long as there's no action.<br />All in all, if you track down a cheap refurbished A20, you should seriously consider buying it, as it's a great camera.","After owning the PowerShot A20 for about 6 months I love the camera, but hate the bundled software.  On the hardware side everything is fine:  the battery life is good, the picture quality is good.  I use a 128MB Compact Flash card with the camera, which can store more than 400 pictures at medium resolution (1024x768), which is plenty good enough for posting on websites.  The big downside is the software.  Canon provides a Windows application called ZoomBrowser to use with the camera.  It has lots of fancy graphics, and also lots of user interface problems.  Although the ZoomBrowser interface can fill the screen only a very narrow band is dedicated to the pictures on the camera, making it difficult to see what you are working with.  Whilst downloading the ZoomBrowser window constantly pops to the front, so you can't do any other work on your computer.  The browser interface can get out of sync with the picture files on your hardrive, which is extremely confusing.  Overall it is a bloated package which has lots of useless features, and does a very poor job of the one thing for which it is necessary -- downloading images.  I did find a better solution -- for $10 you can buy the shareware Cam4You utilities from [...]  This program does a much better job of downloading pictures from the camera, without all the cruft.  The interface is a little unpolished, but it functions much better than the Canon software.","I've had my A20 for about 4 months now, and couldnt bemore<br />pleased...Picture quality is great, and the macro closeups are wonderful<br />(though they do NOT appear on the \"film plane\" as they do<br />in the viewfinder).<br />I dont use the LCD panel while taking pictures , so battery life<br />is fine for me. I have it set so the panel flashes on momentarily so that I can verify the pictue, then turns itself off. In this way, I got over 90 pictures before I needed to replace batteries. For sure get some Nickel Metal Hydride batterias (a wally world item) though!<br />Great camera ! You'll like it!","I was concerned about spending around [price] for a new digital camera. I read reviews and reviews and deceided to go with a Canon A20. Well it turns out that this camera exhibits the fine art of turning out marvelous photos with minimum effort. Once you read the manual and get your hands on the camera, and use it, you will understand how wonderful \"Digital Photography\" is.<br />Fiddle free, simple camera operation and the result is great pictures. Who could ask for more. I've owned my camera about one month, have taken about 300 pictures and the results are marvelous. This is definitely the camera for those who want simply great pictures with minimum effort. It is mostly an all automatic operation with a manual override mode for those who want to do limited exposure settings. I use a 128MB Compact Flash Memory Card that gives me approximately 720 digital pictures at 1024/768 pixel--Medium compression. Beats buying film, and all those other features this camera supports are well worth the [money]I invested.<br />  Don.","This baby shoots great photos with rich, accurate colors, good detail, and it's a pleasure to use. The A20 isn't meant for professionals who need to do lots of manual adjustments - it's perfect for pointing and shooting. You can adjust some settings manually, and there's even a panorama stitching mode, but don't get this camera if you need total control over every shot. Do get it if you want a camera that fits perfectly in your hand (not too big, not too small), has a powerful optical zoom (not like those cheesy digital-only zooms), and takes beautiful photos.<br />You'll DEFINITELY need to plan on getting a bigger CompactFlash card (at least 64MB) and rechargable batteries. This baby drains batteries pretty quickly and you'll find your wallet drained in no time if you only use standard batteries.<br />If you're in the market for a 2MP camera, you should seriously consider the A20. I did the research and couldn't find one in this price range that even came close. I love this camera!","This is my first digital camera and I'm quite impressed with it.  The zoom is great, and I love the digital zoom after you have the optical zoom all the way out.  The auto flash and timer are great features, too.  I found that is camera is very upgradable; you can get different lenses, more compact flash cards, a printer that connects directly with the camera, and ever more yet!!  It works really good on a tripod.  It takes some beautiful pictures and has great resolution.  Very nice camera!","I researched for about 2 weeks before I finally decided on this camera. I was down to the final choice between the olympus and this one. The reason I chose the canon A 20 was it had a wider iso range and also for the panorama feature. The A20 is so easy to use. I was taking pictures within 10 minutes of opening it.Downloading the pictures was simple and quick with the usb port.The quality of the pics was so wonderful I cannot give it enough praise.Crisp and clear and fantastic colors.Although I agree you do have to order the ac power adapter. It is a guzzler. The batteries I got with the camera lasted 2 hours. I have since got the rechargeables and no problems. The software with this camera however is no use to me whatsoever but that is no problem as I have all my own software loaded that I am used to and enjoy.So forget about the software and just have a great time with this camera. It is the best I have ever owned. and I have owned a lot of cameras.","I've had my Canon A20 for about 6 months, so I'm speaking from experience. I'm 80% happy with it.  The colors are good and sharp. I like the optical zoom though twisting the lens to zoom on a 35mm is easier.  I usually shoot on the highest resolution setting, then crop and resize images on the computer.  High and low light conditions can cause some color distortion.  The flash has been acceptable for most shots.  The A20 is a tad heavy due to the four AA batteries.  Ah, the batteries.  There is a flaw in the design of the A20 such that batteries can only be used until the voltage drops a tiny 0.2 volts.  The message to change batteries usually occurs after about 100 pictures but you can still use those batteries for 50-75 or more shots.  Even then the batteries have plenty of juice for a flashlight and most other applications.  Don't throw the batteries away when removed from the camera.  However, batteries are not a problem if you use rechargeables.  Buy a Quantray NiMH Overnight-Charger ($...) and maybe a second set of rechargeable batteries.  I just took 110 pictures in three weeks on one charge of the batteries.<br />Another major fault of my camera is that the TV out does not always work.  I think it is affected by the batteries' condition but I have never proved that.  I could send it back for repair under warranty but I don't want to do without the camera for two months.<br />A (mild) complaint is that the viewfinder does not show all that appears in the picture.  The viewfinder does show a zoomed image, more or less.<br />And now a few words about the software.  It is useful for maintaining a database of photos but if you have a lot of pictures you must use it wisely or it can be real slow -- like 15 minutes to update the database.  For instance, don't add new photos to a folder that has hundreds of other photos.  Load the new photos into an empty folder, refresh that library, then drag them to the desired folder. The layout and printing tools have many good features but also have some annoying hindrances.  I have not found out how to make the default font for captions to be my desired (small) size instead of a large 20 pt size.  I use other software (LViewPro) for general picture editing.<br />Get a 64mb (or more) memory card for the storage of 100 high resolution pictures.  Also get a LowePro case that fits the A20 snuggly and also holds extra memory cards and batteries.  I have the SanDisk Compact Flash card reader which allows transfers of hi-res pictures to the computer each in under a second.  I am glad the A20 makes images in JPG format but I wish there was a resolution setting between the medium and high res settings.","I researched digital cameras to no end and had a chance to shoot and print some photos with other 2+ mega pixel cameras, in my experience the Canon A20 was the best. The print quality is excellent up to 5 x 7. Anything over this is compromised, but still is better than other 2 mp cameras. Be prepared to purchase rechargeable batteries and an additional memory card. An A/C adaptor is not necessary. The software is excellent and very user friendly.","Before this i had a Sony DSC-S85 (799.99) I liked the camera but took it back for one reason only ,the reviews this canon got..Everywhere i look people gave it perfect scores..for the price 299$ at Circit City, now and what it gives you its a must buy. If you dont care for video's,,and just want a great Digital Camera...you cannot go wrong with this at all.<br /> It does use alot of batteries but just buy some rechargeable ones and you are all set..it does need better red-eye reduction, but these things alone is all that is wrong with this camera..and software can fix the red eye photos if you want to..the software will not cost you an arm or a leg either.","No downside here. Easy to use, great quality photos, good software. This is a great choice in this range.","I bought Canon a20. And I m really satisfied with its result. Outdoor result is outstanding and it really give natural colors indoor result is slightly dark.. But when u uses manual white balance its good. Alkalinebatteries give good backup time if you didn't use LCD screen. But I suggest to buy rechargeable battries.a biggest fault which I find in it is that it didn't give u the accurate focus on optical finder. Means if you focus a specific area and when u takes a snap of that u get a wide area result.<br />I don't know what's<br />technique behind it. but if you use LCD for focusing something then it gives u accurate result. Focus is really good and I also use MACRO mode it's also fine. Panoramic Features are cool but I am trying to get 360 digree picture with it. if anyone of you know technique of that then pls tell me. The only fault which I told u it gives me problem sometime.","I bought Canon a20. And I m really satisfied with its result.

The pictures are sharp and the options many.  The only complaint is that the flash head is placed so close to the lens that red-eye is common, even in the red-eye reduction mode.  With the compression options, I can shoot 200+ 1600x1200 pictures on a 128meg compact flash card.  With NiMh batteries, it never runs out of steam.  I was torn between buying a cheaper 'throw away' digital camera and a more expense, higher pixel camera.  I am very pleased with my choice and have not regretted it for a second.","The Cannon A 20 is a nice middle of the road digital camera and is versatile and easy to use. In the high resolution mode you can get very fine 4x6s and nice 8x10s. In lower resolution modes you can fill up the cards with lots of pics for use on your computer (web sites etc.,) The camera has OK software, easy to use, but not lots of features; but it does have a cool panoramic feature and on the camera and has software where you can stitch together many photos, which is really cool. The A-20 is ergonomic and fits in the hands nicely. If you looking for a good Digital camera at a good price the A-20 is a good one.","This is my first digital camera & to tell the truth I was scared that I would get a digital, use it once or twice & then go back to my 35mm. But a salesman who know his stuff & spent as much time with me as I needed convinced me. That & the A20 was on sale for a very good price. The camera is easy to use, takes great pictures & seeing the pictures right away is the greatest.Also the 8x10 enlargements are Photo-shop quality. I would recommend it any time, partically for first time buyers.","Just recieved the camera on the 11th of February and have took some pictures and printed some out. It is very easy to use and the quality is great. I had a Agfa CL30 1.3 megapixel. It worked good, but I wanted a zoom lens and more pixels. This is a very good camera for a beginner also. I would highly recommend this camera.","This little camera is great.  Easy to use, light weight, decent zoom, and excellent color accuracy.  It is a battery hog, but at least you can pick up AAs anywhere.<br />Invest in rechargable batteries and a larger compact flash card, such as the Viking 128mb.  A card-reader isn't necessary, because the usb cable can download dozens of pictures in a few minutes.<br /><br />The Lowepro D-Res 10 AW Digital Camera Bag is the best $... you will ever spend.  Small, well padded, and has room for the extra batteries you'll need to carry.  It fits the camera perfectly.  I bought it based on an earlier review said that with this bag, \"you could throw the camera out the window.\"  I have had absolutely no reason to toss the camera, but snuggled in it's bag, it has survived being dropped in parking lots, banged around climbing rocks, hiking, etc.<br />I have been very pleased with this camera and would recommend it over anything else in it's price range.","Good entry camera... didn't do too well at the dark aquarium using the manual settings. It is very good for snapshots indoors and out under reasonable lighting.  Great color reproduction and nice design.","This camera is a beauty. It is small and compact, easy to use and takes very good quality photos. The software with it is also easy to use. Whilst 2 weeks into the warranty my lense died I found Canon (Australia) reasonably quick in repairing and replacing the lense. Since then it hasn't missed a beat and I am really click happy.","I did my research for about a month before deciding on this little bad boy.  The A20 is is all that and more!  My wife who is a Techno-Phobic finds the A20 to be easy to use as well.  To quote her, \"Is that all I have to do?\"  The picture quality is second to none.  I was horrified by how quickly the Alkaline AA's were drained by the camera.  But a quick trip to [the store] for some NiMH AA's put an end to that.  Do youself a favor and buy two sets.  The camera is relatively small and light, but durable!  The LCD is very nice in all lighting conditions.<br />Also, buy the camera bag that was meant for A20.  I purchased mine at [store] for $9.99.  It is held securely by two velcro straps, so don't worry about it dropping out.  The bag has a shoulder strap and a belt loop so it's your choice how to carry it.  The bag will also carry an extra set of batteries and two flash cards.  The 8MB card that came with the camera was a bummer, but I purchased a 64MB the same day I purchased the camera and soon thereafter added a 128MB.  I've found that Medium Super-Fine mode will yield about 300 pics on a 128MB card.  That's ALOT of pictures.<br />....<br />I also love the Canon software that was provided.  It is EASY to use.  My Father who has a Kodak DC3400, and swore by it, loves the A20.  .... this camera [is compared] to much higher priced and larger pixeled cameras.  It is not a fair assessment.  Take this camera for what it is: A great starter camera!  Yes there are better, but, for the price, quality and the Canon name, you cannot go wrong with this choice!","We bought this camera because it had a wide angle lens which could be purchased and attached to the camera. When the wide angle lens is attached and you use the flash, there is a large dark place, (approx 1/8 of total photo) on the bottom of the photo. It appears the lens attachment blocks part of the flash. Very very poor design.<br />However, in all other uses we are enjoying the camera. I just wish we had not purchased the camera for the wide angle capability.","After Reading tons of review and viewing a lot of sample files, the bottom line was this is the best 2 megapixel camera in terms of picture quality.<br />The price is a bit steep when compared to the other 2 megapixel models but it is well worth the investment.<br />Having used the camera for the last 15 days I dont have any regret in choosing this model.<br />This camera needs a lot of battery power and that is not a surprise since all the digital cameras with a LCD display chews the batteries. Get yourself a good set of recharable AA's. (Make sure that you buy the NiMH rechargables since the older type of rechargable batteries will heat up your camera).","I've had this for about 300 shots (30 saved). I also have four cats, 2 adults and two rambunctious kittens. If I try to use flash, the red eye doesn't work very well on cats, but if I turn off the flash, the shutter speed gets faster and I now have a growing album of adorable kitty pictures. Also took it to a family gathering in a darkened room. There, the red eye was fantastic. When I used Nicad rechargables (I use Monster) I get about 200-250 shots per charge. I always carry a spare set of batteries, and the recharge time is under 4 hours. The Canon case ($10) has room for batteries and an extra memory card. Plus, even though you can control this as you might a 35mm, you can also \"point and shoot\" and you'll still get great pix. Comes with software and cables for PC, MAC, and TV.","I purchased a Kodak dx3700 camera for Xmas for my extremely non-technical wife (no docking station). After reading countless reviews and visiting manufacturer websites, I decided on a Kodak Easyshare Camera. I originally wanted the dx3600 because it had an optical zoom lens. Unfortunately, due to lack of supply and time frame, I had to get to the dx3700 in order to have a gift under the tree. This was my 1st digital purchase. Ease of use and picture quality were my main concerns because we will primarily print the photos.<br />To my surprise, the ease of taking photos and downloading photos was EXCEPTIONAL! I was even surprised that the photos had a date/time stamp and downloaded pictures were automatically categorized into new folders by date (GREAT FEATURE!). In regards to ease of use, THERE IS NOTHING BETTER! Literally, after 10 minutes, we were taking photos and making prints. We were all impressed. However, we had nothing to compare the picture quality to. My wife was also hesitant to let me know that she would have liked a zoom lens.<br />I began to research \"comparable\" cameras with zoom lenses. After thinking about upgrading to a dx3900, I decided to try another brand. I already knew Kodak's picture quality because the dx3900 is basically a dx3700 with 2x zoom.<br />After reading many more reviews and evaluating pros & cons, I decided to try the Canon A20. It was \"only\" 2.1 Megapixels, but it had a 3x zoom and looked like a Point & Shoot. Unfortunately, it did not have a date/time stamp. I purchased one from a retail store knowing that I would return it and buy it much cheaper online. I unpacked it. I immediately noticed that it required 4 AA batteries. The Kodak required only 1 Lithium or 2 AA Ni-MH. The Canon was MUCH more difficult to set up. Kodak had spoiled me. Canon's camera interface and software installation were MUCH more complex. I became nervous because I thought it would be to complicated for my wife to enjoy. I completed all setups. I had her hold the Canon and Kodak, then take some identical pictures with both cameras using the zoom and different settings indoors (where most of her pictures would be taken anyway). I printed them, then gave her a \"Pepsi Challenge\".<br />All of the pictures that she preferred were from the 2.1MP Canon, not the 3.1MP Kodak. The Kodak's were not bad. The Canon's were just better. Contrary to what I would have thought (being a digital novice), she was right. Although Canon's \"ease of use\" was definitely inferior to Kodak's, it had superior picture quality and a 3x optical zoom (remember: the dx3900 only had a 2x zoom). Although we LOVED Kodak's simplicity, we had to opt for picture quality. Although there will be a greater learning curve, picture quality lasts forever (If I can only get her to truly believe that).<br />I returned the Kodak, and ordered the Canon A20 online. I was even able to get the Canon for less than a dx3900. Although I will really miss Kodak's simplicity, every time I look at a printed photo, I will know that I made the right decision. I only hope that battery drain will not become too much of a nuisance.","I've had the PowerShot A20 for about 8 weeks and have taken several hundred pictures with it of subjects ranging from single portraits, sporting events, macro stills and scenic panoramas. It's very comparable in size, weight and print quality to my  point-shoot APS camera. But it's digital! ahhhh...<br />Pros:<br />ease of use - the entire family *likes* to use it; mode indicators are clear; menus aren't too deep<br />fast - even without locking the focus, the shutter is quick<br />imaging - skin tones are good; strong colors look good; white balance options are simple but effective;<br />optics - 3x optical zoom; good results in a variety of lighting<br />dimensions - about the same as my APS camera<br />AA batteries - you can find them anywhere<br />video out - immediately replay your latest photo-fest on TV<br />Cons:<br />flash - eats batteries; no hotshoe; weak red eye reduction<br />memory card - the included card is way too small<br />flimsy doors - the battery and CF doors don't inspire confidence<br />Recommendations:<br />read the manual; at least one 128MB CF; USB CF reader; at least 8 AA NIMH batteries; lowepro Z30 bag; and a bigger hard drive!<br />For printable snapshot work, the A20 is a keeper.","I gradually built up my digital camera collection as I searched for an ideal combination of megapixels, zoom capability, image quality, & price.  The search is over.  This is the one.  The pictures I took on two recent trips to national parks in Wyoming & Utah were sharp, breathtakingly beautiful, & when printed out on photo paper by my HP 970 printer looked as good or better than those taken by a film camera.  So much so that many of my friends had no idea that the prints were digital photos.  I repeat, this is the one to get.","The disposable AA's that came with it were dead after about 20 shots at highest resolution and the homereplacements were about the same. This camera should be run on three sets of rechargeable 1600 MAH NnMH - one set in the charger, one in the camera and one on standby. I concur with almost all of the other reviews","After doing an agonizing amount of research, I settled on the Canon Powershot A20 and do not regret it for one minute. I'm amazed by the quality of both the camera and the digital photos it takes. It definitely compares well with some of the film cameras I have owned and exceeds some too. Printed photos right up to 8 x 10 show excellent detail and all colors are true. I'm confident I made the best choice and I'm very happy with the camera.<br />It's easy to handle and all controls fall right to hand. I recommend purchasing an extra compact flash card (at least 64mb), as well as NiMH rechargeables and charger. I also purchased a San Disk reader.","I have had my Canon A20 for about 6 months and I love it.  I went from a 35mm EOS to this and have not regretted it a bit.  One thing I didn't want was one of those digital cameras that say \"ooh look at me, I'm digital..\"  I prefer taking great pictures without drawing a lot of attention to myself-- more candid and natural looking photos that way. It is small lightweight and incognito.<br /><br />Before getting the camera I was concerned about image quality being up to snuff and with this camera it turns out not to be an issue.  I never use it at its highest quality setting and I can not tell the difference between my digital photos (even enlarged as 8x10s from ofoto.com) and my non-digital photos!  Any more than 2.1 mega-pixels would definitely be a waste of money-- both on the camera and on the memory required. Really, don't bother.<br /><br />The best and the worst thing about this camera are one in the same:  editing out unwanted photos on the fly.  How awesome is it to just trash the loser photos along the way so you only end up with all excellent photos?  That is probably why I'd say I take better pictures with this camera than I ever have before!  The downside is that it takes a few more button presses to delete that bad photo than I'd prefer.  But, having used Sony and Nikkon Digi-cams too, it's about the same on them all.  I wonder why they're all like that?<br /><br />Accessory musts:<br /><br />Sandisk compact flash card reader [price]<br /><br />64mb compact flash card [price](stores about 100 quality photos)","I really like this camera.  You get a great camera for the price you pay.  It's easy to use, and the photo quality is way beyond what I expected.  It's also realatively small and light weight, so is easy to carry around.","This is my first Digital Camera.  I have found it fairly easy to be up and running (there's a Quick Start Guide).  Battery life so far has been reasonable.  I'm still running on the original batteries after using the LCD extensively, downloading three times, and taking about 60 pictures. I also bought rechargeable batteries and charger.  Also purchased the 128MB SmartCard (it was only $15 more expensive than the 64MB card after rebates). I don't expect to take portraits, but I was able to take pictures of my son's birthday party and send them to my parents a few hours later. They loved it.  Wish it came with a case.  I like the weight - it feels sturdy.  Someone suggested here to buy some of the Palm Pilot screen protectors to apply to the LCD screen.  Probably a good idea since I've kept the original on the camera and noticed a few scratches already.  Canon should recess it just a bit.  Good intermediate camera for the money.","This camera is simply amazing! I read up on almost all digital cameras finally deciding on this one because of the price and features.<br />Picture Quality - The picture quality is great! It has surpassed all my expectations as a 2 megapixel digital camera. The skin tones are right and colours are not overly saturated. Chromatic abberation is minimal and overall it takes very good photographs. However, camera shake is an issue so you might want to hold the camera still, but this only happens when you turn off the flash in dark conditions. The photographs might appear a little (only slightly) out of focus but don't worry because they will look fine when printed in 4R sizes!<br />Battery Life - Although this camera does not come with a rechargeable battery, I bought 2 sets of 1600MAH rechargeable (Sony and GP) for use. Don't go for anything less than 1600MAH! The battery life is superb even with the LCD screen on.<br />One of the main functions of a digital camera is the WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) feature, so why compromise by using the optical viewfinder?","What a picture taker. Awsome!!!!!! Great battery life, I just returned from a shoot and took over 200 pictures using the flash 90% of the time on one set of batteries. Take professional photo's right out of the box, easy to get started.I can't keep my wife away from it, she has never liked to take picture's untill she tried the A20, she haas become a photo nut like me. If you are a beginer or a pro this is the only way to go. Thank's Canon for a great camera. I have already saved enough money on film processing to pay for it and I have only had mine for 2 months.","I bought the canon powershot A20 about a month ago after lots of researching and reading reviews about digital cameras.  I opened it up and right away shot the whole flash card worth of pictures of my new baby.  I was in heaven, after finally finding an easy to use affordable digital camera.  However, quickly, I decended into computer hell and am still there more than a month later.  I tried the no-brainer software installation and camera interface. After much frustration, called Canon support and was told the camera was bad.  So, I sent it in to Canon service, only to have them send it back saying it was functioning fine.  I then got on the line with HP support to check out my USB ports.  After twenty hours of trouble-shooting (with a screaming baby in the background)I took the whole lot to the computer gurus at the fix-it store.  They got on the line with Canon support, who said the camera was bad, send it in.....so Federal Express is loving me at this point, and I sent it to customer care at Canon.  They called and said they couldn't get it to interface with their computer and sent it to repair.  Repair sent it back to me (without contacting me first) and said it works fine and wouldn't be of further assistance.  Got my camera back...takes great pictures butI can't load them onto a computer.  I bought a compact flash card reader which also does not work on my computer, but does work on my father-in-law's new Mac powerbook...so Merry Christmas Dad-in-law...enjoy your new camera.  Great camera-really, really, bad customer service and advice....","I bought this camera mostly based on reviews here and let me tell you - everyone who rated it high is right ! I'm very pleased with the ease of use and all the extras it has (ex. viewing pictures on your TV by a simple hook up). As most others have stated you need to buy a battery charger and some extra memory (at least 64mb). It doesn't eat batteries as bad as I thought it would. The key is to use the \"non-digital\" mode when possible and view / edit your pictures at one time. I took 75 pictures of my son for our christmas card and was able to pick one to save. I can't imagine how much that would have cost with regular film.<br />Just buy it !!! You won't be sorry !!!!!!!!!","I've owned the A20 for about six months now. I have no<br />complaints. It has taken excellent photos both outdoors<br />and indoors with just the push of a button. I haven't<br />seen a need to use any of the manual settings. The<br />LCD screen is very crisp and gives me a good indication<br />of the quality of the stored image. Battery life is<br />somewhat of an issue, but this is offset by the fact that<br />the A20 uses easily available AA batteries. I use rechargeable<br />NiMH batteries. Turning off the LCD display<br />greatly extends the battery life. Considering the<br />high pixel resolution and zoom capabilities, I think<br />the A20 is and excellent value.","I looked for a digital camera primarily to use for emailing photos, taking photos to post to a web site, and for use in taking photos for online auctions.  The last thing I was thinking of when I purchased this camera was just how exceptional a job it does of taking excellent photos that can be printed out as 4x6 photos.  It does all of this better than I expected for the price.<br />I had looked at the similar Sony, Olympus, Nikon, and even the Canon Elph cameras, but came away with this one.<br />Aside from MPEGs, video or shots with sound, this camera does everything I have asked it to do.  The extra bells and whistles of some of the other models were not required for the applications I am using.<br />The camera is small, very close to my compact 35mm camera, also very close in price.  It has a good feel to it.  It's built, as are all the Canons I am aware of with a plastic body.  It is certainly durable enough.  One comment left a star off because of durability.  My thought on that is try dropping any digital camera and see what's left of it.<br />The Canon A20 incorporates an excellent flash, simple straight forward menu...yes, you will have to read the manual...,excellent download time, bare minimum photo editing software, as most of the others do.  The viewfinder, again, as with other brands does not capture the full picture results, but that is a minor point.  It fits great in the hands and acts like some of the compact 35mm I have owned, except that it takes better photos than any of my 35mm cameras.  That was the surprise.<br />If you want a digital camera at what is very possibly the best price and value, and you want one for printing photos, general web usage, along with a Macro feature, and good zoom range, I have not seen a better camera.  While you cannot control the shutter speed on this model, it does take superior photos in low light conditions without using the flash.  This camera is sensitive, so...depending on what you plan to photograph and the conditions you will be taking pictures in, I recommend getting a decent tripod.<br />While this camera does go through alkaline batteries very quickly, it certainly does not do so as fast as other models I have used, but you will want to get the NiMh batteries (two sets), along with the charger, also a larger memory card.  Toss in your choice of photo editing software and you are off to the races.<br />I have not used all of the cameras in the 2.1 megapixel range, but for the price, the funtions, and the quality of the photos, I don't think that for my use there would be any point to look further.  This is truly an outstanding product.","I bought the A20 some months ago.<br />The pictures have an outstanding quality, also in a dark environment. The camera is user friendly and the software included with the camera is good.<br />I advice that users buy rechargeable batteries as it consumes lots of batteries when the display is being used.","I recently purchased this camera online along with a Lexar 256MB<br />compact flash card. I have to say I couldn't have asked for<br />better results than the ones I recieved. My first camera outing<br />was to Storm King Art Center, in Cornwall, NY. I was able to<br />connect to my laptop with easy. I did installed the software<br />prior to leaving me house. I was able to Take 250 pictures<br />download to my laptop and begin again. I took over 1,000 photos<br />in one afternoon and the results were AMAZING. This is truely<br />a quality camera. I recommend buy a tripod, rechargable<br />batteries with charger, and a large memory card if you'll be<br />snapping pictures continually, like myself.","I wanted a point and shoot camera to take on vacation, that was convenient and takes good quality pix--for both digital use and to print snapshots. The cannon A20 Delivers! Effortless picture taking, sharp quality pix, good colors and a flash that doesn't wash you out. I tested it out at my friends wedding earlier this month....<br />Now the caveats:<br />1. Factor in the cost of a 128mb memory card. That will take approx 128 pix on the highest setting 1600x1200 at superfine compression. I've found that this setting gives you nice 4x6 prints comparable to a film camera. ...<br />2. Battery life: the change battery signal will come up very quickly if using the display. However, THIS SEEMS TO BE MERELY A WARNING--DO NOT CHANGE THE BATTERIES. I've been able to power up again and again after the warning and take the rest of my pix on the memory card.  I also invested in a 5hr nimh quick charger with a spare set of 4 AA batteries ....<br />(NOTE:camera will NOT take those lithium batteries, I called cannon and confirmed this)<br />3. When taking pictures, be very careful of camera shake. This camera is very sensative to this, especially if taking pix without flash in lower light conditions. Be careful or your picture will end up BLURRY. So take a deep breath, hold and snap! Ok, maybe holding your breath until you turn blue is a tad of an exaggeration--See what works for you. Most of my pix have turned out nice and sharp.<br />4. Using the viewfinder only, without the LCD display will show you only about 2/3 of the final pic. (It ends up with space all around.) So, contrary to everyone's posts here: Have fun with the display! Even if it is a battery hog! This is the best way to see the lighting conditions and actual appearance size of the final picture.","I recently purchased a Canon A20 digital camera and I am more than happy with it.  The pictures this camera takes are GREAT and the colors are fantastic.  It's also very easy to use. Ni AA's last a long time in this camera ( a long time for a digital camera).  A 32 meg memory card gives me over 140 pictures at small size(640x480), super fine quality.","I have been an avid photographer for 30 years mostly using a 35mm SLR. I also carry a 35mm Nikon point and shoot. I thought a digital camera would be fun but really didn't expect too much from it in terms of quality images. Before buying this unit I read every review I could find on several models and ultimately settled on this one. I have to say that I am surprized and delighted with the capabilities of this camera.<br />Accessing the menus is simple, the controls are easy to use and the pictures are terrific. The camera rests comfortably in your hand with the zoom control handy to your right thumb. To make sure I wouldn't run low on power, I bought 2 sets of Ni-MH batteries and a charger the same day I got the camera. I take nearly every shot with the display turned off and I don't have a single complaint about battery life. Since I started looking for a digital camera, I have been paying more attention to other people using theirs' and I can't believe how many people use the display when they are shooting pictures. No wonder the batteries run low! Personally, I can't see how they can take pictures like that... well I guess people like the gadgetry. The software is pretty basic but it installed without a hitch and seems to work perfectly. As far as a reliable, easy to use point and shoot digital camera, I think this one is great! I also think that some of my older stuff may be collecting a bit of dust except for the most demanding tasks.","After spending several hours reading the reviews on Amazon for all the different digital cameras available now, I decided on<br />the Cannon A20. This is my first digital camera and after spending the past weekend taking pictures of everything in site, I'm in love with it. It's easy to use and the picture quality after uploading the images to the PC is fantastic!<br />I'd definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking to buy one in the 2 Megapixel range.","I've had the A20 for a couple of months now, and it's excellent. I can't add much more to what has already been said here about the camera itself, regarding pros and cons. I must say, I haven't had any inclination to drag my APS Elph out with me so much, now that I have the A20. The A20 is bigger than both the digital and film versions of the Elph, but it really is light-weight thanks to the plastic case and really not that much harder to tote along than the Elph. And it's just hard to beat the instant gratification of digital photography, especially when the results are so pleasing. I think photo quality actually surpasses that of my APS film camera. I also got the 128 MB Viking compact flash card, and in fact will probably order another. I was also pleased with all of the software that came with the camera. Elsewhere, I've heard people put down the ZoomBrowser software, but I found it gets the job done very well and works well with my other software. As good as the camera itself is, what really sold me on the A20 camera was the fact you could get a reasonably-priced water-proof case for it. I did in fact buy the WP-DC200 case and it's awesome. I'm not really into underwater photography, but at least now I can take my A20 out in the snow or on the beach and have fun snapping away, knowing my investment is well-protected. The WP-DC200 permits you full access to all buttons and features. You can also fully extend the zoom lens within the waterproof case. There is an anti-reflective coating on the lens of the waterproof case, which is a must and a very welcome feature. The waterproof case does add some bulk, but no worse than the bulk of my 35 mm SLR. And its design echoes the comfortable ergonomics of the camera itself and is easy to grip, even with small hands. You do need a steady grip and a strong index finger, though, to depress the shutter button. It does take a small bit of practice to feel fully comfortable manipulating the A20's controls through the case. But after awhile it becomes second-nature. I'm also eager to buy some of the accessory lenses and possibly the card photo printer available for the A20. I think it's great that for a camera that is basically a point-and-shoot digicam, so many great accessories are available to extend the A20's versatility.","I just wanted to point out an easy solution for the glare problem on the LCD with this camera.  Buy fellowe's WriteRight Screen protectors for a palm pilot (at staples etc.) and cut it to fit the screen.  This doesn't cost much and cuts the glare signficantly.<br />Other than that, nice camera.","I decided I finally had to get a digital camera just before I went on vacation so I did a quick search on Amazon and came up with the Cannon A20 after reading all the good reviews. This camera has not dissapointed, and works great with windows 2000 pro. The picture quality is awsome as well are all the other features.","I bought the camera for my wife's b-day. She is a professional photographer and she has been interested in dabbling in digital photography. I didn't want to spend a lot of money just in case she was disappointed. We are also going to Europe shortly and I wanted a point and shoot camera that wasn't bulky and something that a novice, like myself, could use. At minimum, my wife wanted controls over exposure, white balance, and shutter speed.<br />After months of research I was down to 3 cameras - the Canon S110, A20 and a Sony DSC-P50. Since they all have received very good reviews it was really down to ergonomics and personal preference. ... My wife loved the A20 because if had excellent ergonomics with a grip on the right side and room on the left side for you fingers. The layout of the buttons on the A20 was also straight forward (as were the S110). All cameras had a solid feel to all of them. Personally, I would have chosen the S110. I love the size of the camera.<br />Overall a great camera that met my wifes expectations. We will be taking this camera to Europe and leaving the 35mm at home.<br />Strengths:<br />Ergonomics - the hand grip and locations of all the controls, lcd, and viewfinder remind my wife of a 35mm camera. The camera also has a build in lens cover when off. Size - not too small, not too big. It is smaller than our 35mm point-and-shoot camera.<br />Photo Quality - excellent excellent excellent. The colors and sharpness are better than I ever expected. Prints come out wonderful.<br />Features - for our purpose it has everything we need. It doesn't have a manual shutter control but that is ok. The auto shutter does a pretty good job. You can affect the shutter speed by placing the camera in manual mode and by using, or not using, the flash.  I also appreciate the camera not having a \"movie\" mode. That is what a camcorder is for. I've seen \"movies\" made with digital camcorders and i don't find them useful or even viewable.<br />Shutter Lag or lack of - this puppy is quick. I pretty much treat this camera like a 35mm point and shoot. This is especially true when the shutter is pressed half way to first set the exposure and focus.<br />Uses AA batteries - this is how it should be (I think the Sony also allows for Lithium batteries). If I need batteries in an emergency I know I can easily find them almost anywhere. I bought a great charger (Maha C204F) and 1800mAH batteries.<br />Price - it can't be beat.<br />Menu Layout - the menus are easy to follow and have a simple hierarchy. I hate having to got through layers of menus to get to where I wanted to go.<br />Download speeds - very quick.<br />Weaknesses:<br />Compact Flash I only - doesn't allow the use of IBM's microdrive. However, a couple of 128MB CF cards have been more than enough for me<br />Flash - it could be more powerful but that could probably be said with all cameras that I've looked at.<br />LCD Screen - the size is fine but it is difficult to read in bright sunlight. I think the S110 has an advantage here.<br />Bottom line ... if you want a great point & shoot camera at a low price then you can't go wrong with this.","I've had this camera about 2 weeks now. I've formed these opinions:<br />Pros: 1.  3X optical zoom lens with Canon lens quality.  2.  Excellent picture quality.  3.  Great full auto mode shooting. 4.  Nice variety of picture sizes and compression options. 5.  Able to take Macro close ups. 6.  Photo stitch several pictures together for a big panorama. 7.  Some manual features available such as forcing a flash or turning it off, and exposure compensation. 8.  Everything you need to get started except a computer is included.  9.  The camera is has a fairly speedy operation.  The time it takes to turn on and snap a pic is just 2 to 3 seconds.  Other operations are generally fast too. 10. Able to turn off LCD screen and greatly increase battery life.<br />Cons: 1.  The 8MB Compact Flash that is included is ridiculously small for a 2.1 Megapixel camera.  You will spend extra money in buying a 32, 64, or 128MB Compact Flash module.  Factor that in to your overall cost. 2.  The LCD screen is tiny.  While you can get a good sense of how your photo will look, those little icons telling you things are tough to read unless you have the eyes of an eagle. 3.  The controls are not very intuitive.  You WILL need to read the manual that explains what they are and how to use them. 4.  The software included is the bare minimum needed to download and print your pics.  You will most certainly want to buy some supplementary software for editing, creating albums, etc.<br />Contrary to what others say, battery life is acceptable.  ALL digital cameras with LCD screens drain batteries fast.  The A20 is no worse than the rest.  You may want to invest in some Ni-MH (nickel metal hydride) rechargeable batteries.  Radio Shack sells some with charger for around $22.<br />Overall, I find the A20 a good point and shoot zoom digital camera.  Canon skimped some of the stuff that comes with the camera, but the camera itself is a fine product.  If you are like me, you will wind up buying a bigger Compact Flash Card, Ni-MH batteries, and some better photo editing software.  Probably spent another $100 for all three.","Easy to use and great shots.  Be aware that you will need to add more money for the AC Power Adapter, otherwise you are always running on batteries, that do not last long...","I cannot say enough about this camera. After doing significant research prior to my daughters birth, I decided to purchase the A20. Straight out of the box in the delivery room, I began taking breathtaking photographs. My daughter is soon to be the most photgraphed baby in the family if not the world itself.<br />This camera is a snap to use. Point and click and you are off and running. Installation of the software on my Dell computer was also a snap with Windows ME. The pictures download fast using the USB cable supplied. I do recommend that you purchase rechargeable batteries and a larger memory card.<br />Do not get trapped in the whole mega pixel debate. For family use, this camera shoots great prictures.<br />This is a winner!","I just bought a Canon A-20 two weeks ago.  In short it’s a great camera.  However, there are several problem areas one should be aware of before buying this camera.<br />The first big problem is it eats batteries.  Depending on the resolution you are shooing at (I always shoot at the highest) you may only get 20 – 40 shots before the batteries run out.  The solution is to buy several sets of rechargeable batteries and always carry a spare set with you.<br />The second problem is the flash is rather weak.  In my opinion the subject should be less than 8 feet for the flash to illuminate properly.  Even within this range some shots seem underexposed.  There are some exposure adjustments you can make but I haven’t tried them yet.  Also I don’t want to screw up the exposure for normal daylight since these shots usually seem fine.<br />Another problem arises when shooting indoors with the flash.  The flash refresh seems to be quite slow at times.  I tried to shoot pictures of my daughter swimming and I missed several good shoots due to the delay in refreshing the flash.  I kept holding down the exposure button and nothing happened for perhaps 15 – 20 seconds. This may be due to the batteries running down.<br />The 8mb flash memory card supplied with the camera doesn’t hold many shots at the highest resolution. Less than 12 I think.  When thinking about spending the ($) or so for this camera you also need to budget an additional ($) or so for a 128mb flash card.<br />The camera does best in fairly low contrast settings.  If there are bright areas in the background the subject usually comes out too dark.<br />That about covers it on the downside. On the plus side.  Under controlled or even lighting conditions the pictures are awesome.  Colors are really vibrant and very sharp.  For general snapshot photographs the camera is great.  The size is small and very comfortable to hold.  In whole it is a keeper.  Hope this review helps.  Good shooting!","I must have researched purchasing a digital camera for at least six months, including reading hundreds of customer reviews, before I finally broke down and took the plunge.  At first I was leaning toward an Olympus C-2040, but finances and a re-evaluation of my digital photography needs led me to the PowerShot A20.<br />I've been using it a lot in the two days since I got it, and it is a *very sweet* camera.  I barely had to look at the manual to get up and running with it, although the manual was helpful in explaining some of the more specialized features.<br />I plugged it into our TV, and not only can it display pictures from there, I can also use it as a monitor to take pictures!<br />I installed the download software that comes with the camera, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that you have a choice in which image editing program you send the pictures to.  I am not usually a fan of bundled software, preferring to use Photoshop, but the PhotoStitch software that comes with the camera is really pretty good!  It allows you to stitch together images in several ways.  I was concerned when the pictures I took in PhotoStitch mode didn't seem like I had matched them correctly, but the software is incredibly intuitive.<br />I also like the rapid-fire shooting option.  I used it near the goal at a soccer match yesterday, and it helped me catch the moment when the goal attempt was made!  Later I just deleted whichever rapid-fire shots were blurry or didn't capture the action.  I can also send pictures from my computer to the storage disk on the camera, so if I wanted to create a slideshow to travel with I could!  Like I expected, it is a battery hog, but I bought myself a good rechargeable battery set with charger when I purchased the camera, and I'm going to buy another battery set this week so I can rotate them out for charging.  I also need to get a much larger CompactFlash disk.  I have two of the 8MB ones right now, which work fine for short trips, but it would be nice to just take photos for a while and not have to clear a few of them out for space periodically.<br />Overall I am thrilled with the performance of this camera, and it looks like all my research paid off.  It does some pretty incredible stuff for the price, as well as starting up quickly, being ready to take the next shot quickly, and having a responsive zoom control.","I have experimented with several digital cameras.  I have been using a Nikon 990 for the past several months, but it wasnt mine, so I decided that it was time to buy my own.  After endless hours of reviewing, I purchased this camera.  I am so happy I decided to perform such an extensive review!  This camera takes photos highly comparable to the Nikon!  This camera is easy to use, and comes equipt only with (in my mind) the essential options.  This camera gets all thumbs up.  Some have claimed that it is a battery hog, but thats because these people obviously have not used other digital cameras; they all are battery hogs!  Do not even think that of not buying rechargeable batteries (2 sets), and youll have no worries about running out of juice.  I cant even say \"for the price its the best\"; it just simply is one of the best!","This is an awesome camera in a tiny package.<br />Having used but never owned a digital camera, I spent a lot of time researching various options, with image quality being a major consideration, and ease of use being second.  Having used SLR cameras for years, I am comfortable with them, but I am not all that familiar with digital cameras. After all the research, I decided to try this one...and I am so glad!<br />The camera is straightforward and relatively simple to use, and the software is user-friendly.  I bought a SanDisk reader for download, and would strongly recommend this to anyone as a battery saver.<br />The images from the camera are clear, from close-ups in the house to landscape photos outside, and the color quality is impressive, even without the use of white balance.  I just put it on automatic and shot away.  Saturation of the photos is good, with nice delineation and clean shading.  I am very pleased and look forward to taking many pix with this camera.","I recently took the A20, my first digital camera on a trip and was greatly impressed by the color. On top of it all I was most impressed by the flexibility provided by the manual mode.  I just took the camera to the 4th of July fireworks in Boston.  By switching off the flash and adjust the exposure, I was able to capture some nice pictures of the firework.  The power was not a problem, I shot in excess of 80 pictures throughout 40 minutes of the fireworks.  Althought not as small as the S100/S300, its size is decent without the price tag.","This camera is a fun, but practical gadget.  For the price, the resolution, choice of compression levels, 3x optical zoom, USB connectivity, Canon name, stitch-assist mode, and ease of use make choosing this camera over any other mid-level camera a no-brainer.  You will certainly be disappointed if you try to use standard Alkaline AA batteries with the camera, but NiMH rechargeable AA's are sold in a competitive marketplace and you can buy batteries that can take 150+ pictures before needing to be recharged.  Also watch for the hard waterproof case once it's widely available if you'd be interested in underwater photography, a definite advantage.  The camera will almost certainly be supported under Linux with the gPhoto utility, if Linux-compatibility is important to you.","One other feature of this fine camera has not been mentioned - Image Stitch.  I have taken a number of  panoramic image sets using the stitch function.  Canon software which comes with the camera stitches the images together and creates a panoramic view.  The resulting file can be saved in various formats including jpeg and PICT, but also can save it as a Quicktime VR file.  I have taken a number of 360 degree photos.  I love this versatility.  This easy to use camera has the right combination of file size, image quality, ease of use, and versatility.  I have been very happy with the purchase.","this is a wonderful camera. the pictures look great even at close zoom. i looks complecated but it isn't.the only i wish it came with is a waterproof case.","I have had this camera for about a month, and I love it!  I actually purchased the Oympus 510, but it was defective, and no more were in stock, so I \"settled\" for the Canon A20, and I'm glad I did!  The color is SO unbelievable!  My photo looked like something out of a magazine!  I just keep looking at the pictures I have printed in awe, because I can't believe the quality!<br />One thing to consider:  the day you buy this camera, buy rechargeable NimH(?) batteries and at least a 32mb compactflash card.","After much research over the Canon A20, Sony DSC-P50, or Olympus D-490Z, I decided to go with the Canon.  I have not regretted my decision once.<br />The pictures are crisp and sharp, and color is vivid and intense in bright light and dark areas with the autofilled flash.  (Sony has a reputed problem with taking shots in dark or shady areas) The camera's features are easy and take less than a few hours to figure out and instructions are useful. Camera is very sturdy and construction seems solid, unlike the Olympus D-490Z, where the opening for the lens seems like an expensive accident waiting to happen. There is a macro for taking extreme close ups, panaramic feature, (which I have not tried to figure out yet) timer, and autofill and red eye flash settings. There is also a middle setting of photo saving compression which is lacking on other cameras. But do plan on purchasing NiMH as this will save you much money in the long run.<br />Only a few small irks kept from giving a 5 star review.  Camera and subjects in pictures must be very still when taking pictures or blur is easily visible. Now I'm an amateur and don't know whether all digital cameras suffer from this so just thought it was worth mentioning. View screen is smaller than others and difficult to see in bright sunlight. There is also no medium light setting. What I mean by this is in darker settings, you must either be brighter than bright with the flash, or manually set no flash, which for some reason makes focus more difficult for the camera.<br />All in all, would recommend this camera to anyone interested in digital photography, even tech illiterates cause the camera is easy enough to figure out. Not to mention the price is also right at $399 compared to other cameras in the 2.1 class.","This Digicam's awesome. I had mine for 1 week, and the pictures are better than one would expect from an entry level Digicam. I still can't believe this Cam can give me 7.5x pictures that are clear. Wow. But the 3x optical zoom is excellent by its own account.<br />There are just a few minuses. I can't manually set the shutter speed. Though there's a slow sync option, you can't really see the difference. The film coating for the LCD screen is not the top notch anti-reflect kind Canon has on the S series, which can be a pain in the behind if you shoot under the sun like me. Aside from that, very good Digicam.<br />But buying Digicam comes added cost... -<br />1) Viking 128MB Compact Flash Card. You'll need this for sure. At 1600x1200 @ SuperFine, you'll 140 pictures.<br />2) Lowepro D-Res 10 AW Digital Camera Bag. Got to trust me on this. Its the only bag you want your Digicam to be store in. Forget the overpriced Kodak and Canon bags, this baby has storage for 4 additional AAs, special pocket for additional Compact Flash Card, fits your Digicam like it's made to order, and enough cushion and padding to make throwing you Digicam out the window safe. Plus, there's a secret feature on the back if you get the chance to buy the bag.<br />3) Kodak Photolife K1000 AA Battery Charging Kit. AA batteries are way better than proprietary Canon Lithium batteries on the S series Digicams. And with a charger that juices the included batteries up in 2.5 Hrs flat, you just can't go wrong. Did I mentioned Kodak 1600 mAh NiMH batteries last forever between charges?<br />4) SanDisk Imagemate USB Compactflash Reader. This one's totally up to you...this baby can transfer your photos to your PC/Mac faster than from your Digicam, which will give the batteries and Digicam a rest.","I just received the A20 this morning, and have been playing with it ever since. The button layout, controls, and interface are easy to understanding and pretty much straight forward unless you got hit on the head by a club when you were a kid... Anyway, compare to the S100, which I also have, I would definitely pick the A20. Besides the fact that the S100 is all metallic, has a much smaller dimension, and a superior anti-reflection LCD screen, the A20 out shines its brother in every other terms... Okay, maybe S100 has a overall advantage in the exterior compartment, but I was looking for easy to use digicam that can give me excellent pictures, good battery life, and ease of usage. The A20 hit all the sweet spot with its 3x optical zoom w/ 2.1MP CCD, utilizes Ni-MH rechargeable batteries, and large user friendly button. I love this digicam... Now, on to my trip to San Diego Wild Life Park.","The canon powershot A20 digital camera is a great camera for people on the go. It is a very easy camera to use. Just point and shoot. If you love takeing pictures then the canon powershot A20 digital camera is the camera for you.","For the price, this is a very good camera for the casual photographer who mainly wants point-and-shoot ease, with a few adjustable features, and a mid-range zoom (3X optical - avoid the digital except for previews!). It's about the same size as a basic 35mm film camera, and I like the hand-hold ridge (although I'm glad I'm not a lefty!). It takes very attractive, clear, and accurately-colored shots IF there is sufficient light (either ambient or within its flash range): everything from scenic panoramas - the included software is easy and produces nice results on the computer - to macro-mode closeups (I recommend pulling back a couple inches, and using the zoom to narrow the view). HOWEVER, the flash range is naturally limited, and if there are deeply shadowed areas in the image, or not enough light in general for a wider-angle view, the picture comes out blotchy and grainy. The ISO comparison is only 100 up to about 150 with +2 exposure - I didn't realize just how limiting this would be when I purchased it.<br />The other main drawback is shutter speed, or lack thereof. Every digital camera has lag between pressing the button and finishing the image file, but be aware that many things add more delay to its focus time and shutter release, too, e.g. automatic focus (which is always on, except for subsequent shots in panoramic stitch-assist and _?_); red-eye reduction flash (which uses a pre-flash red light); and any flash slows down subsequent shots, for recharge time. All this makes it harder to capture a quick moment with sports, kids, animals, special occasions, etc., especially during the period of learning its timing. The \"continuous shooting\" mode helps, when you know such a moment is immanent, but it's still slow, especially when you need the flash.<br />My only problem with ease of use - the controls are mainly self-explanatory, and the manual clearly explains everything (even if it is rather scantily indexed) - is the \"half-depressed\" step of the shutter button, for getting the focus / focus-lock (signalled by the optional Beep) - I've had the camera for several \"rolls\"-worth of snapshots now and, too often, I still push the button all the way before I intend to.<br />Also, remember: You'll need to buy AT LEAST 64 Mb total of CompactFlash memory, to avoid running out, and 2 sets (8) rechargable batteries to \"leapfrog\" in use. (Lithium ones aren't compatible, by the way.) A USB card reader is also worth getting, so you don't have to connect the camera every time - unless you have a printer with a built-in CF slot(?).<br />Overall, if you mainly take still and/or scenic shots in good light, this is a nice, user-friendly, compact, relatively inexpensive option.<br />Oh, by the way, don't bother buying the closeup add-on lens - if I can clearly photograph a pair of earrings and hardly need to crop the image, what more would anybody want?","All I know was that I wanted a digital camera. After looking at some high-priced models with major megapixellage (is that a word?), I decided that this Canon was the best. It's quick, simple, and does what it should do best: take digital pictures. Add a Canon S600 printer to your computer, and your images will rival that of any high-priced photo shop! The USB connection is terrific, as well as the video out cable for putting the pictures on my mom's TV after we got back from vacation!! Not much else to say except this camera is highly recommended. Do yourself a favor and get some rechargable batteries, though. This thing uses alot of power like nothing else. A great buy.","This is a great novice point and shoot camera. The ability to use recharable nimh batteries is also excellent as you don't have to buy an expensive proprietary battery. We've got well over 80 shots and still have yet to change the batteries.<br />Highly recommended.","This camera can be as simple as point, shoot and you have great pictures. The software is straight forward and easy to use. It really makes picture taking a fun family event. My only complaint is it does not support a USB connection to Windows 95. A NIMH battery charger is a must as well as a larger compact flash card.  It also has many advanced features that will keep anyone interested.  The picture qulity is much better than I expected. Film is done.","I knew I wanted to get into digital photography but I knew virtually nothing about it. The expert that reviewed the A20 finished his review with the comment that the A20 should be at or near the top of my list. I purchased the camera about a month ago. It is a gem. The 3X optical zoom gives it the versatility I need to compose most shots. The colors are outstanding, especially the flesh tones that are so important to family pics. The macro mode allowed me to take some stunning floral shots. The digital advantage has allowed me to produce our car clubs monthly newsletter using Microsoft Picture Publisher Gold, with photos of the club members automobiles inserted. I purchased the ACK 600 AC adapter to allow hookup to the PC with no battery concerns. The Canon Zoom Browser software is excellent, downloading is a snap with the USB hookup. If you're looking for a lot of camera for the money, excellent photos, good software, \"warm\" color, then look no further. I have also enjoyed the direct hookup to the television set using the connector supplied with the camera. I love this camera. Good Luck!","I bought the A20 this week and am \"pushing\" it as hard as I can.  I maxed the resolution to 1600-1200 and printed the outside shot on 11 by 17 photo paper...the lens is just terrific, the sharpness of focus from near to far is super.  I have been asked to do some more 11 by 17 prints for my supervisor.  It is a great camera value.  The 11 by 17 print -- from a three year old HP 1000 looked as good as some of the 3 megapixel cameras out there at almost twice the price.  Those of us used to point and shoot cameras will definately enjoy this camera and even those who are familiar with 35mm SLRs will be impressed. The colors seem very strong and the software provided with the camera does its job very well, however, I like more creative control for Altering photos.  It is nice to see that Canon used good lenses for their digital camera, it sure helps.","I've had the Powershot A20 for about a week now, and I love taking pictures with this camera!  The lens is great, the zoom is great, the software is great....<br />I've used the Olympus 3000 and a Kodak DC240 extensively, and I can't believe how much friendlier this camera is!  It turns on really fast, it focuses quickly, and if you prefocus, the notorious digital camera shutter lag is almost non-existant!<br />Make sure you pick up a larger CF card and rechargable batteries, though.  8mb is not enough, and I've gone through 2 sets of AAs in 150-200 pictures...","I purchased the Powershot A20 3 weeks ago, and I have found it to be a great mid-level d-cam. I got a Powershot A50 about 2 years ago and absolutely loved it. When I had the opportunity to upgrade a few months ago, I was disappointed with the selection of 2.1MP cameras. I decided to wait on the upgrade and keep my A50 1.3MP. When the A20 came out, I had to have it! The thing that stands out most to me is the speed of this camera. It can take pictures much more rapidly than the A50. Playback occurs almost instantly and the USB interface is so much faster than serial.  Add great picture quality, decent battery life, and 3x optical zoom and you have a great camera.  Moreover, the A20 is the same price that my A50 was 2 years ago! Prices are going down!  The best feature with the Canons is the software. The ZoomBrowser is the best tool I have ever seen for managing images. I have around 2000 pictures stored in the ZoomBrowser from my old d-cam and I can see every picture on the screen at once! This makes it easy to find that great shot from 5 months ago. This software has biased me toward Canons for a good reason.  The A20's shortcomings include mediocre red-eye reduction, a small LCD, and occasional  focusing problems in the Macro mode. These are problems with most Point and Shoot d-cams.  I also miss the sleek metal casing featured by the A50. The A20 is plastic, but this does provide better ergonomics than the metal box of the A50.  The A20's accessory line includes an underwater case and auxiliary macro and tele lenses. I plan to buy these accessories as soon as I find them on the market. These features put this camera way above others at this price point. There are better d-cams than the A20, but their advantages are few and their prices are double. Overall, this is a high quality d-cam with high end features, outstanding software, and a very good price. It is a terrific value and I am happy that I bought it.","I never thought I would enjoy photography so much.<br />We bought this camera while we were on vacation, and the very first photos we took with it were excellent, despite the fact that we had the resolution set to 640 x 480.  The zoom is wonderful - as I learned when I wanted to take a sunset photo but some trees were in the way on the left: I used the zoom to get past them.<br />One of the sunset photos was printed by EFrames.com onto regular photo paper, and I've got it sitting on mydesk:  you can't tell that it was taken with a digital camera.<br />This is a great, well thought-out product that is fun to use.","This camera is great! It has a 3x zoom, great picture quality and best of all it runs on 4AA batteries which makes it great for vacations. I suggest getting rechargeable high-capacity batteries and a charger. I wish this camera would have included a case as the camera body is made of plastic and the LCD screen is exposed to scratches and nicks. This is a good camera for those new to digital cameras who don't need percise control over the picture settings. If you do need the control I suggest a Nikon Coolpix 990 or a Nixon G1. Overall this camera gets 4 stars for picture quality, size and easy of use. However, it misses the final star for being on a 2.1 megapixel camera when most new cameras are 3 megapixels and above.","The A20 arrived yesterday and I have been having a blast taking pictures of my three kids in action.  The camera is very easy to use, I was shooting pictures 5 minutes after opening the box.  So far I have shot 155 images, all on the first set of NiMH AA....  The upload process to the computer was straightforward and works quickly via the USB connection.  The 8MB memory card provided with the camera is not really adequate for too many pictures.  I bought the 128MB Viking flash memory card along with the camera.  It just popped in and it worked.  I like the 3X optical zoom on the camera, it gives me some choice on how to compose the pictures.  The colors from this camera are amazing, very lifelike.  The camera saves all the images as JPG's (in one of three levels of compression).  The JPG's have been easy to email, the files are not too large.  The flash provides good coverage indoors, but I have not tried many shots more then about 10 feet.  There is no short video clip mode which some other digital cameras have, but I thought this was more of a gimmick then a useful feature.  If you want a digital camera which is easy to use and takes great pictures this camera is a good choice.","Saw the ad, checked it out on dpreview.com, bought it.  Took less than an hour to set it up, take 35 pictures, install the software, download the pictures.  Took pictures that were supposed to be the camera's weak points - low light indoor pictures (poor focus) and some at max flash distance (~12 feet). Everything came out perfectly.  Love the focus, the flash, the speed to focus and the lack of delay once you push the button to actually snap the picture.  Simple to use yet it produces amazing results.  Plenty of advanced features should you decide to use them.  The included Photo Stitch software allows you to stitch multiple exposures into a panorama view.  Minor limitations: only supports USB downloads (no RS232 or firewire), all photos stored in JPEG format (does have choice of 3 compressions - normal, fine, superfine) and finally the zoom lacks fine control in that it always zooms further than I'd like. All in all a terrific value!","I had a Powershot Elph S100 and although I liked the small size I wanted something with more accurate colors, less of a blue cast, and better battery usage.  The A20 fits the bill.<br />The colors on the A20 are great.  They are more saturated and a lot more accurate than the Elph.  I will no longer have to go in and filter out any blue casting.<br />Low light capabilities are better than the Elph with the exception of focus.  The A20 automatically adjusts to ISO 150 in low-light which is something I don't think the S100 did.  I notice the background in regular and slow-sync to show much more detail at night on the A20.  I have however noticed less accurate focusing in low-light than the Elph.  Pictures also tend to be a little grainier at times perhaps due to the higher ISO in low-light.<br />The battery life is great.  I am using the AA batteries supplied with the camera and I have taken over 150 shots and used the LCD half of the time and I still have not received a battery warning.  The batteries however are listed as \"Industrial\" Alkaline which may mean they have a much longer life than regular AA batteries.<br />I do miss the size of the Elph, the fact it looked just like a regular Elph2 camera, the rugged metal body, the anti-glare film on the LCD (the A20 has none), and the slick look of it.  However, the A20 produces better pictures, has a much better underwater case (goes to a depth of about 100ft), and will last much longer on four AA batteries than the Elph did on its ... proprietary battery.<br />Of course, for a smaller camera there is always the S300 however it still uses the proprietary battery and is ... more.  Plus, it is still bigger than the S100 was.  The image quality of the S300 however should be the same as the A20 except that the S300 will focus better in low-light due to a better focus-assist lamp."]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE S304","amazon_reviews":["The Minolta s304 is a fine camera if you can get it for significantly less than it's current retail price.

I ever used SLR cameras and professional films with good results. That is my first contact with a digital camera; so I belive some of my opinions may be shared with beginners in digital photography.<br />These are my impressions of Minolta S304 (1 month after purchase):<br />Pros:<br />- Very beautiful, small, solid and well constructed, giving impression of a durable machine;<br />- Ease of use in almost all situations;<br />- Very good control of important parameters like white balance, ISO sensitivity (\"usable\" ISO 800), sharpness and color;<br />- Good optical zoom (140mm);<br />- Good macro performance even with flash;<br />- Good pre-programmed scenes;<br />- Very good flash;<br />- Very responsive;<br />- Manual control;<br />- Good movie capability;<br />- Good connection with computer;<br />- Excelent picture quality (nothing is more important in a camera, isn't it true?).<br />Cons:<br />- Only two options of aperture;<br />- Moderate low light capability (larger aperture=3);<br />- Some autofocus problems in low light;<br />- No autofocus assist lamp;<br />- Poor optical viewfinder;<br />- LCD problems in low light and sunlight, sometimes you can't see what you are shooting (I think it is a common disappointing problem with digicams...);<br />- Dust can enter between LCD plastic cover and LCD itself, what is very difficult to clean up (I don't know if it is a problem with the camera I purchased or a commom problem with that model. If you have one, please let me know.).<br />My conclusion is that Minolta S304 is an exelent camera with some problems I can live with. For that price, I think there is no competition nowadays. As I mentioned above my final point is picture quality and this camera deliver very good samples.<br />If you want to see some of my samples, please go to (...)<br />Pictures were taken at 2048X1536 size, with fine or standard image quality, converted to sRGB and resized down to 800X600. No other \"software manipulation\" were made on original pictures.<br />I would apreciate any opinion. Please remember I am a beginner and if the pictures are not so good, don't blame the camera...<br />Thank you all and good luck!","I purchased this camera after quite a bit of research.  I looked at Sony, Canon, and Fuji cameras.  The Minolta S304 had the features I wanted (plus some extras), for a great price.<br />The only negative is that it eats batteries like there is no tomorrow.  But that is a problem with ALL digital cameras.  You must get at least 2 sets of rechargeable batteries if you're going to take the camera out for a day of shooting.  Don't use standard Alkaline batteries, they won't last 30 minutes.<br />One hint for improving battery life.  The LCD screen is the major culprit for eating batteries.  If you're used to taking pictures through the viewfinder, continue doing so with any digital camera.  Turn off the LCD.  The batteries will last at least twice as long.<br />Memory cards are very very cheap today.  If you're going to spend $... on a camera, spend the $... for a 128 mb memory card.  That way you'll have plenty of memory to take all the photos you want without having to delete the bad ones in the middle of your day to save card space.  With the Minolta S304 set on Fine and an image size of 1200x800, I can take 172 photos on a 128 mb card.  That is a LOT of pictures.<br />As for those people who have problems using the USB hookup.  Why are you still using Windows 98??  It was the very first version of Windows to have USB support and it was beyond buggy.  Upgrade to at least Windows 2000.  I have Windows ME and the USB works flawlessly.<br />Great camera, great features, and it looks like a real camera.","I've had this camera for almost 2 weeks.  Overall, I am very satisfied with its performance.  The pictures are better than my 35mm film camera (Minolta freedom zoom)  This could be because of the obvious advantage of digital cameras - the ability to delete bad pictures right away.  With a good printer and paper, I can't tell the difference between developed film, and my digital printouts.  I love the 4x optical zoom, and I was surprised to see the the lense hardly sticks out more for 4x zoom than for no zoom.  By the way, for amazingly detailed reviews of digital cameras, I highly recommend dpreview dot com.  I can be kind of picky, so don't let this list of cons scare you too much.<br />Cons:<br />- Sometimes pictures are too bright when flash is used.  This happens more often when white or light colors are in the picture.  As another reviewer mentioned, sometimes you can't make out the details, or the color, if the object is a very light color.  This can be corrected sometimes with the software once the picture is on the computer.<br />- Sometimes the pictures are a bit out of focus.  From what I have heard, almost all cameras have this problem in low light, but sometimes in good light, I will get a slightly blurry picture.<br />- I dont know how fast other cameras eat batteries, so I can't compare.  I do agree with other posts that they seem to die quickly.  I guess the capacity of batteries is rated in milli-Amp hours.  The camera recommends batteries with at least 1500 mah.  Most good battery brands have a 1600 mah battery, I found one brand, Monster, with an 1800 mah AA battery.  I bought 2 sets and a charger. (was only able to find them at Circuit city)  Seems to work OK, but does eat them up, especially if you look at the pictures a lot on the LCD.<br />- Film time limited to 60 seconds, no matter how much memory you have.  Film requires very bright light to turn out good.  Its not a problem in the day, you can just open your window blinds.  At night though, I needed to put on every light in the room.  Our living room(11x15, with medium colored wall) has 2 60 watt lamps, and that was not enough light, I has to bring in our halogen light.  Our kitchen has brighter walls, and 5 60 watt bulbs.  That was enough.  I guess this makes sense though, since you can't use flash for a film.  The sound is OK, but there is some background noise.<br />- The optical viewfinder does not show what the picture will be like.  The image catptured will go further to the left, right, and down, than what you see in the viewfinder.  Now that I know, I just keep that in mind.<br />- To save batteries, I really with there was an option to make the LCD not turn on when you turn on the camera.  You always have to hit a button twice to turn it off.  No big deal, just annoying.","First- the positives:<br />The camera is super easy to use.  I had it out of the box and within one minute was taking pictures.  I installed the software for downloading pictures without reading any manuals, and got the pictures off it super easily.  The pictures look great!  So I have been very happy with very little effort.<br />Now- the negatives:<br />The camera [eats] through batteries like you can not believe.  I have not bought the hydride batteries which will hopefully work better- but on regular batteries you can take about 20 pictures with the LCD on before it runs out of juice.  No kidding- no joke.  If you turn the LCD off, it lasts longer (but also you can't really compose your image in the same way, so it is preferable to have the LCD on).<br />Some of the straightforward shots had poor focus.  Not many- only about 1 out of 12.. but some of those photos were my favorites.  Oh well... I guess I'll have to figure out how to control the focus manually.","I purchased this camera after a lot of research.  Initially it was not in my budget but a [amt] price drop happened at just the right time.<br />The camera takes very sharp pictures, I have a 1.3Mp camera and these pictures are an order of magnitude sharper, especially when you crop, enlarge, etc.<br />I do agree with another review, you MUST have rechargeable batteries and let them charge overnight or you will only take about 20 minutes of pictures and get a low battery signal and the camera will shut down.  I bought 2 sets of batteries just to be sure to have one set always charged.<br />The optics on this camera are very nice, no chromatic abberations (purple fringing), very little flat noise, colors are very good, even better (print wise) when run through the Image Viewer software.<br />I highly recommed this camera for the quality of optics, the fair amount of manual control and great photos!","Ths is a great camera.  I have waited for many years to get a quality digital camera with 3 Meg Pixels for under $500.00.  The only disappointment is that Minolta lists that you can use alkaline batteries, which is not correct.  They recommend Ni-MH, which is the only batteries I have found to work properly. Using alkaline batteries result in a low battery indication after only a few shots.  Getting the Ni-MH and charger are worth the extra money.  I only wish that Amazon carried the batteries and charger.  On standard photo setting the supplied 16Meg memory will only store 20 pictures.  I recommend getting a 64Meg memory and the USB memory reader attachment for the PC.  Download to a PC is easy directly from the camera.  A 6V DC adapter is also available for powering the camera, but I haven't found that this is necessary.","This camera is awesome, what makes it even more spectacular is the price. I could not be happier with it. First, it has great zoom capabilities. Second it is 3.3 megapixels for under $.... What more could you ask for?! Well, you may not be able to ask for a lot more, but you sure get it.<br />Before I bought this camera I did a lot of research. I even visited some of the local camera shops and electronics stores to get a feel for the different cameras before I ordered one on the net. Boy, it sure paid off.  There were some that had a body made of plastic. I don't intend to spend $... on something that is made of plastic. Others were very small and were uncomfortable to hold. The Minolta is the perfect size and weight.<br />When I hooked it up to my system for the first time, I was able to upload pictures in minutes.  Another nice feature is that you can take up to 60 Seconds worth of video, very nice. The video even loads up to the system easily.<br />In addition it uses a Compactflash card. These are pretty reasonably priced. A 16 MB card came with the camera. Most of the pictures I have taken so far are about 500K, so you can store quite a few pictures. I also purchased a 128 MB card at a good price here on ..., so I have plenty of space to store pictures before committing them to CD via my system.<br />I only have one warning. You need to buy Ni-MH batteries. Then charge them for at least 24 hours, the first time. If you don't the camera will keep coming back and telling you that your batteries are dead. When I called support they kept telling me that I had to buy a special brand of batteries. This wasn't the case, you just need to fully charge the batteries.<br />From what I have seen this is one of the best buys you are going to get on a camera.","I like the Minolta's in general, especially because they tend to have excellent optics that render sharp photos with very true color reproduction, and this one is no exception. Physically, it reminds me of the Kodak 4800, though it is built better and has a heftier feel. The 3.34 megapixel resolution is about as much as anyone will ever need (makes very clean 11\" x 14\" enlargements), and the optical 4x zoom is a honey. The 16 meg memory card is okay to get started, but of course a bigger card and a card reader are nice additions down the road. The camera has good battery mgt, good USB connectivity and decent software (not really a Minolta strongpoint). All in all, this is a camera that will disappoint no one, though for the money I'd go with Diamge 5.","I think this camera has been overshadowed by its cousins - Dimage 5 and Dimage 7. But the S304 uses much of the same technology in a smaller package. The S304 has been compared to Nikon Coolpix 995 and this compares favorably at a much lower price. And if you are looking for a 'conventional' digital point and shoot this should be high on your list.<br />Pros: 4x zoom lens, 5 preset shooting modes (portrait, macro, landscape etc), movie mode with sound, lot of optional manual settings allows you to 'grow into' the camera, great value for a 3 megapixel camera with the recent price drops, sleek looks(!)<br />Cons: Some problems with autofocus in low light (but a lot of point and digicams have this problem).<br />Please note that this camera uses a proprietary color space. Conversion to sRGB color space using the included software improves the colors as they appear on the monitor. But this is a fast process and is also optional. (There is not much difference after the conversion - for most people who will be using the camera).<br />Please note that many of the other sites where you may find lower prices may not be reliable. Of course, you need not worry if you are ordering from Amazon !!<br />And if happen to be a user of this camera please share your feedback and comments here.","This camera is one of the best I have used, the pictures are sharp and its easy to manage. I recomend it to anyone who loves to take quality picture and want to get and affordable camera","Hefty metal body, great optics, loads of features, and reasonably intuitive programs. I've been only using full auto mode with great results, no camera shutter, amazing detail and color. Nearly took it back when I kept getting weak battery signal but by cleaning batteries with Scotchbrite pad as needed, this problem disappeared and now I'm really satisfied. And recent price drop makes this 3.3 mpx beauty a real bargain.Way to go, Minolta !!"]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE 5","amazon_reviews":["I recently got this camera as a free hand-me-down and thought it would be a great way to introduce my husband to the world of digital cameras without spending money on a new one. Even though the technology is old compared to today's digitals, I thought it would help get him started, learning how to transfer photos from the camera to the computer, etc.<br /><br />I was thrilled with how easy it was to use (and very easy for a first time user) but the fun of it was over before the end of the day because the batteries wore out so fast. My husband lost interest as soon as he realized he'd have to change batteries every day. He knows I don't do that with mine (a Kodak Easy Share with rechargeable batteries that last a long time) so he said give it away to someone else, he doesn't want to spend money on replacing batteries.<br /><br />If you come across this camera in a bargain bin or at a yard sale, I'd say don't buy it as your one and only camera, but if it's cheap enough ($5 to $10) you might want to buy it as a back up - you know, if you're taking photos at a party and all of a sudden your regular camera's rechargeable batteries are kaput and you forgot to recharge your back up rechargeable (it happens), well then you've got this back up in a drawer.

This entire series of cameras are terrific in terms of their final image quality because the pictures are not touched in any way by post processing. What you get from a high-res jpeg is a direct interpretation from the raw data, just like what you get from an Exilim ex-z75 pocket cam, just like you get from any camera in raw mode, just rasterized into a jpeg format, so don't ever bring yourself to use the TIFF or raw formats on any of the 7-series cameras.<br /><br />These cameras were indeed ahead of their time.

Even though the technology is old compared to today's digitals, I thought it would help get him started, learning how to transfer photos from the camera to the computer, etc.<br /><br />I was thrilled with how easy it was to use (and very easy for a first time user) but the fun of it was over before the end of the day because the batteries wore out so fast. My husband lost interest as soon as he realized he'd have to change batteries every day. He knows I don't do that with mine (a Kodak Easy Share with rechargeable batteries that last a long time) so he said give it away to someone else, he doesn't want to spend money on replacing batteries.<br /><br />If you come across this camera in a bargain bin or at a yard sale, I'd say don't buy it as your one and only camera, but if it's cheap enough ($5 to $10) you might want to buy it as a back up - you know, if you're taking photos at a party and all of a sudden your regular camera's rechargeable batteries are kaput and you forgot to recharge your back up rechargeable (it happens), well then you've got this back up in a drawer.

Its controls are easy and comprehensive after a short but necessary learning curve. The onscreen feedback is well designed and intuitive. The picture quality is great on \"Fine\" and up... don't bother with the lower quality settings unless you're seriously cramped for space. You WILL be disappointed, but then the lowest setting uses something like 75% JPEG compression, so it's to be expected. The \"Super Fine\" setting uses about 5%, \"Fine\" about 10%. Perfect for general and \"photo\" uses. The RAW format, which takes a very long time to save to media, has 0% compression and is a lossless format. It does require the proprietary software to download and use, but if you're looking for a way to store that \"special\" picture and don't mind the save-time, use it. I used it for a few on-the-couch family sittings from a tripod.<br />Battery life is ok to good using NiMH high amp batteries and skipping the use of the LCD. The simulated TTL EVF negates the need of the LCD for typical picture framing anyway.<br />The only two things that *I* have found to complain about this camera are:<br />1) It gets a little warm where you hold it with with your right hand after lots of pictures... I'm talking like 100 or more pictures right in a row. click, click, click, click... Average picture takers probably won't notice this, and I never did until I got serious the other night about tweaking and fine-tuning some of the manual settings for different lighting situations in my house. Again, I *only* noticed this due to the pretty much click-after-click use for about 100 - 150 pictures.<br />2) In non-flash \"average lighting\" situations, it tends to keep the shutter open longer than I would like, showing ghosting and trailing in *some* pictures. Sitting in my living room the other night with 3 lights on, not using the flash, I noticed the shutter speed was 1/3 while using the flash decreased shutter speed to 1/45 to 1/60. Those settings made for a MUCH more stable pictures. This problem was extremely noticable at my daughter's christening this past weekend when the priest's hands were constantly trailed... he's a very animated fellow.<br />Manually overriding the shutter speed is easy and works mostly well, but again, in some lighting situations, you'll find yourself tweaking ISO and/or f/stop settings. In short... use the flash if at all possible, even if only to fool the camera's computer.<br />Other than that, I give the camera a 4.9999999999999 stars. The shutter speed thing is the only thing stopping the flat 5 stars rating :)<br />Buy it, enjoy it, use it. You won't be disappointed.","There was a review posted earlier with some serious errors. This review is to help you make an informed decision about this camera.<br />Yes, this camera is a battery hog. Most digital cameras are. So much that the set of four alkaline AA batteries that came with the camera were good for about 8 pictures. Yes, eight. However, a set of NiMH (nickel metal hydride) rechargeable batteries and a charger was included with my camera. The charger is an overnight charger, so you may wish to consider the purchase of a fast charger and another set or two of NiMH batteries.<br />The camera has several levels of compression when it stores the pictures. The superfine, fine, normal, and economy are in standard JPEG format that DO NOT need to be converted to any other format for use. The sRGB format does, however. This stores images in a 36 bits per pixel format. This is a professional-quality format that requires 9MB per image! If you are going to use this format, get a larger CompactFlash card (or IBM microdrive).<br />The download speed via USB is relatively slow compared to other digital cameras, including my older Toshiba PDR-M70. If you have a large CF card, you may wish to purchase a separate USB CF reader for faster transfer speed.<br />Well, there are the negatives. Unless you dislike a camera with a fast shutter-release speed, incredible levels of manual control (including program shift and manual white balancing capabilities), an incredibly sharp zoom lens, and future-proofing via firmware downloads from the Internet!<br />I've had 5 digital camera previous to this one. While the Minolta has some negatives, it is seriously superior to any digital camera I've owned before. Definitely worth a look!","I too was frustrated at first when my camera chewed up a set of Nimh batteries. BUT!!! I looked into how a Nimh works and I learned something. The Mah rating is a detail that you don't want to miss. As of this day of this review that I'm writing the highest Nimh rating for a set of AA batteries is 1800 Mah.<br />  Now, the set that I placed in my dimage5 was a 1200 Mah rating. (Fairly quick drainage) Then I went down to Wal-Mart and picked up 2 sets of 4 AA. This set was 1600 Mah and let me tell you that I noticed a huge increase of length of power.<br /> Take a look on the side of the Nickel Metal batteries that you are using and see what the Mah is. Chances are you if your camera is chewing up batteries like my uncle Dave is with a turkey at Christmas then the rating is low.<br /> A little advice for all of us Camera junkies. Get 3 sets and get a good fast charger. Rayovac sells a one hour charger and they sell an optional car cord online. I havn't used it yet but I'm thinkin' about it.","I have had this camera for about 2 months now and love every bit of it.  It takes amazing photos, the optical zoom lens is spectacular and the camera has all the manual options so that I can have complet control of the photos.  The manual settings are NOT on a menu driven system so it is quicker to make changes (and uses less batteries by not having the screen on all the time).<br />POWER SAVING TECHNIQUES:<br />I bought PowerEx Rechargables and I get about 600 pictures per set... More than enough... A couple tips for longer battery life.  Do not use the Large screen unless completly nessesary.  Use the EVF on auto on.  The View finder will turn on when you place your eye up to it.  Also, do not use the continues focus option... It will kill the batteries in no time.<br />The best camera I've ever owned... Long exposure night shots... simply amazing.","I recently purchased the Dimage 5 after doing quite a bit of research on digital cameras in it's class. I bought my first digital camera 4 years ago (olympus 320d) and since then have been waiting for that moment when someone would produce an affordable, high quality digital camera that would give me the flexibility and control that my old Canon Ftb slr did. I have to say I am pleased with the results. The color rendering is accurate without being over saturated. The level of manual control offered and it's accompanying results are very good. The performance of the EVF is quite good even in low light situations. Placement of the controls are convienent once you get used to them. The ability to have 35mmSLR-like control of shutter speed, ISO, manual focus, and a manual zoom ring(not a fan of motorized zoom) is wonderful. Did I mention the lens accepts 49mm filters? I have not experienced what I would consider to be unusual power consumption as some have experienced. I am using 1600 mAh NiMH batteries purchased from the local Radio store. Of course I do take advantage of the power saving features such as setting the EVF to only come on when my eye is at the viewfinder and I rarely frame with the lcd panel. I use it mainly to briefly view a shot after I have taken it. Shooting maximum size shots at the fine setting I had no trouble getting 75 frames over the course of a 2 hour hike along the local river on one set of batteries. Whats missing? Image stabilization and built in noise control for high speed ISO settings and low light shots. Other than that I am completely satisfied with my purchase.","ok, all people with power consumption problems need to realize the following,<br />1)alkaline batteries do not provide the same power curve as rechargeables do, why would you even sonsider using them, any good digital will use batteries at an astounding rate accept the olympus' which come with thier own specific lithium batteries, but expensive to replace.<br />2) rechargeable batteries when brand new need to be charged first or they will not operate at their fullest capacity, the manufacturer does not make them charged<br />also, this camera is awesome, i work in a camera store and the dimage 5 is always fun to play with, and has made some astounding pictures. the camera uses batteries at only a slightly higher rate than other brands, but is still respectable.","This itineration of the Dimage series brings excellent quality and useful features to the buyer in the 'upper middle' segment of the digicam market. The Dimage 5 is almost identical to the Dimage 7, though it sells for roughly 1/2 the price, with the only difference being the 3.3 megapixel resolution of the Dimage 5 vs the 5 megapixel resolution of the Dimage 7. If you are not planning on shooting pictures ultimately intended to be blown up to poster size, 5 megapixels is not going to be worth the money.<br />This camera is well made, well balanced (though slightly large for my preferences) and features an excellent electronic viewfinder, great optics and a very powerful and accurate 7x optical zoom (bumped by a 2x digital zoom if needed). Its controls offer a lot of options for creativity, while the fully auto setting makes life simple for those who like it so. It does require the purchase of a much larger (128) memory card and a second set of batteries, but otherwise is ready to go as is. The main competitor, in my opinion, would be the Olympus 2100, which has a more powerful zoom (10x) and the highly desireable image stabilization.","This is my third dig. camera. I like it a lot. It has lots of great features such as 28 to 200 mm optical zoom, varies exposure controls, SLR with EVF....<br />However, if you are considering this camera you have to aware the following 3 points:<br />1)The viewfinder is electronic screen. It is fine but the subject is still cannot compare to optical viewfinder. If you need high detail view, then you need to consider.<br />2)All photos need to re-save with Minolta's own software in order to convert the file into the correct sRGB color space ( don't ask me what it is) according to some major dig. camera review sites. Yes, every single photos.<br />The above two points are acceptable as long as it produces fine photos. But...<br />3)Power consumption is unacceptably high. I put a fully charged NIMH cells in and it only last about 5 minutes and the battery icon started to blink. And the camera shut itself off.<br />I've heard that this camera is power hunger but don't know that bad.<br />I hope it was my camera that has a problem and I have to return it.<br />I still miss this camera.","The camera itself is excellent--the software I got for mine is almost impossible to use--way too complicated and contradictory to the printed manual. I`ve noticed this before with Minolta stuff--Great hardware, extremely confusing software.","I love everything about this camera except for the way it chews through batteries.  If you buy this camera, make sure you invest in a good battery charger and at least 3 sets of good quality batteries.","The product is excellent from the prespectivesc described below.I rate the product as:<br />Picture Quality: 5<br />Ease of Use: 5<br />Features: 4.8<br />Cost - Benefit: 5<br />Overall: 5<br />I am absolutely satisfied with the product."]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE 7","amazon_reviews":["Had to return as it was just to much camera for a beginner.","I bought this camera when it first arrrived on scene about 2004. It was 1st 5mp and also capable of taking IR images due to not having a filter between sensor and lens. I used it only for IR. It has all glass lens and a great macro setting at wide and tele ends. After looking around for over 2yrs. for another D7 and seeing prices around the $200/$400 for an 8 yr. old cam I did not to spend that much. So when I saw this ready to buy and in good normal condition for $75 I figured why not. I was pleasantly surprised at its cosmetic condition. It looked new and it worked fine except for a small issue with the CF slot. Since I had this issue already with my old D7 I was able to get around this with care. If not the cam was worthless. So I am very happy with my buy and have used it for HDR-IR images with expected results. However this is older technology so it is very slow in info transfer to card. Other than that this is still a great piece of digi history","The camera was listed as 'acceptable\" but the one I received (used obviously) was a little more banged up than I had hoped for. Rubber around the eyepiece is split and coming off, no user manual (which is not good with a camera with this many functions and capabilities), no USB cable, dead batteries (not that big of a deal), and seems to have a few performance issues.<br /><br />The LCD screen on mine flutters at times between color and black & white like it's going out. Sometimes when pressing the shutter release it simply doesn't take a picture. Try it again and it does. The LCD screen on the Dimage 7 is also VERY small. I realize this is one of the first digital SLR's on the market and if you look at the back-side image on Amazon it does look pretty small, but in person it's REALLY small. Also (and this is probably due to when it came out) after you take a photo it doesn't stay on the LCD screen to look at. You have to switch modes and manually look at the photo. Again, due to when this model came out no big deal but if it matters to you just be aware of it. Just realize that if you do load the photo onto the screen to look at it, it's really small.<br /><br />Mine came with a camera bag and 2 SD cards which is nice. Overall it looks like it has been through a lot in the past and I'm just hoping it will hold out for at least a year. The main reason I purchased this camera was to use it with a Hoya 58mm RM-72 Infrared Filter so I at least hope it works well with that once I order it.","I bought this camera second hand for about $250 and originally when first introduced, was selling for about $1500..<br />And, the reason I bought it was because it could take 'INFRARED\" photos.

If you put it into manual mode and focus yourself, set the light meter yoursself and make sure the shutter speed is appropriate you will be very happy with the results. It also sucks batteries like no other camera I've ever seen it you use the viewfinder alot. My suggestion is to get a few good sets of lithium batteries and keep the viewfinder off, then you will get a good 50-75 picts out of a set of batteries.<br /><br />[...]","Had to return as it was just to much camera for a beginner.","I bought this camera when it first arrrived on scene about 2004. It was 1st 5mp and also capable of taking IR images due to not having a filter between sensor and lens. I used it only for IR. It has all glass lens and a great macro setting at wide and tele ends. After looking around for over 2yrs. for another D7 and seeing prices around the $200/$400 for an 8 yr. old cam I did not to spend that much. So when I saw this ready to buy and in good normal condition for $75 I figured why not. I was pleasantly surprised at its cosmetic condition. It looked new and it worked fine except for a small issue with the CF slot. Since I had this issue already with my old D7 I was able to get around this with care. If not the cam was worthless. So I am very happy with my buy and have used it for HDR-IR images with expected results. However this is older technology so it is very slow in info transfer to card. Other than that this is still a great piece of digi history","The camera was listed as 'acceptable\" but the one I received (used obviously) was a little more banged up than I had hoped for. Rubber around the eyepiece is split and coming off, no user manual (which is not good with a camera with this many functions and capabilities), no USB cable, dead batteries (not that big of a deal), and seems to have a few performance issues.<br /><br />The LCD screen on mine flutters at times between color and black & white like it's going out. Sometimes when pressing the shutter release it simply doesn't take a picture. Try it again and it does. The LCD screen on the Dimage 7 is also VERY small. I realize this is one of the first digital SLR's on the market and if you look at the back-side image on Amazon it does look pretty small, but in person it's REALLY small. Also (and this is probably due to when it came out) after you take a photo it doesn't stay on the LCD screen to look at. You have to switch modes and manually look at the photo. Again, due to when this model came out no big deal but if it matters to you just be aware of it. Just realize that if you do load the photo onto the screen to look at it, it's really small.<br /><br />Mine came with a camera bag and 2 SD cards which is nice. Overall it looks like it has been through a lot in the past and I'm just hoping it will hold out for at least a year. The main reason I purchased this camera was to use it with a Hoya 58mm RM-72 Infrared Filter so I at least hope it works well with that once I order it.","I bought this camera second hand for about $250 and originally when first introduced, was selling for about $1500..<br />And, the reason I bought it was because it could take 'INFRARED\" photos.

The results are comparable to the real film but with digital manipulation, the camera provides a more versatile and efficient application. The examples of black-and-white images taken by this camera can be seen at:[...] The only things need to be improved for this camera are: 1) the autofocusing function is too slow and sometimes not accurate especially in the dim light; 2) the range of aperture is relatively limited. Overall, this camera is probably the only digital one for photographers who are seeking taking black-and-white images.","This is my second digital camera, and at first I hated it because it was not a point and shoot, which was the only camera I had ever known. It was just too complex for a meathead like me to use.  If I'd have reviewed this camera a year ago I would have given it a 2 star rating.<br />Over the last year I have really gotten to know the camera and have upgraded the firmware, and I now take great shots with this camera, using a 512mb CF and (usually) 3 sets of rechargable NMH AA batteries.  The firmware fixed alot of the bad issues with the camera, and most importantly sped up the drive rate for multiple shots. I would say that the firmware was the most important thing here. It truly makes the camera great.<br />This camera has phenominal picture quality without the firmware update and will teach a meathead like myself to take better pictures just by the trial by fire approach. It only gets better as you learn to use it.  That being said - if you don't like a steep learning curve challenge and are used to point and shoots, this is not the camera for you.<br />I purchased the 7i for my father in law and I can tell you that its a much easier camera to use than the 7, but with all of the great features. You may want to go that route if you want the great image quality without as steep of a curve.","The D7 is great value now it's being remaindered. BUT<br />1. You need to upgrade the internal software (Minolta call it firmware) This gives you near D7i performance for about $(...), much faster focusing and lots of other improvements. (see minoltausa.com and/or some of the specialist minolta D7 websites)<br />2. You must have quality 2000 mah NiMh batteries and charge them using a quality 'intelligent' pulse charger. (Rayovac PS4b?)<br />3. You must minimise power comsumption by setting the camera:<br />LCD off and EVF on auto (only comes on when your eye comes near the viewfinder),<br />EVF and LCD brightness set to 2 or less,<br />Instant playback set to 2 sec or less,<br />Auto switch off set to 1 minute,<br />Auto focusing set to single - not continuous.<br />1,2 & 3 above will enable, very roughly, 8 hours of shooting and 120 shots.<br />4. Lastly - have the patience to deal with all the buttons and learn the camera!","Lenses have been the BIG WEAK POINT on high-end consumer digital cameras, and image resolution isn't far behind. This camera fixes both problems spectacularly. The 7x zoom lens is very sharp throughout its range, and making it manual was a stroke of genius. It's the only SLR-like digital which actually has the feel and vibes of an SLR.<br />Yes, there are a lot of adjustable features, but you eventually get the hang of them, and they become very nice creative tools.<br />I don't seem to have the battery problems that some report, since I use the automatic eye-level viewfinder exclusively, and I turn the camera off if I'm not going to use it in the next few seconds. It boots quickly when you turn it back on.<br />The automatic focus is a bit slow, and so I use the manual focus quite a bit. It has a dedicated switch to toggle between manual and automatic.<br />My only real aggravation is the time the camera takes to store RAW images, which means you really can't use them in a dynamic shooting situation.  But I can live with that, given all the other really great things about it.","I read many reviews of this camera before I bought it.  Let me say right up front that it definitely has its flaws - I'm not sure any technical gadget I've ever purchased was free of them.<br />The flaws of this camera are well documented:  eats batteries, little port door keeps popping open, auto-focus a little slow, and the manual zoom is stiff.  The software you need to run against all of your downloaded photos is an unfortunate step in the photography process.  These are all true, and certainly annoyances.<br />But, the positive side of the balance sheet completely overwhelms the bad.  Everything about this camera feels top notch.  Its mostly metal construction, great optics and plethora of features are all part of a well-integrated product.  Very little fluff, save for maybe the little mode selection that allows you to pre-set types of photographs:  portraits, sunsets, etc.  They could have ignored that stuff.<br />It's the way you can adjust this camera that shines.  Manual focus and easy of switching between automatic and manual exposure settings are examples.  I count thirteen controls, which seems overwhelming until you get the hang of what they do.<br />The electronic viewfinder is maybe not quite as nice as a great optic through-the-lens one, BUT you can see all your settings without taking your eye off of your subject.  And, it switches between a black and white mode and color, depending on the amount of light in the room, so the viewfinder continues to be useful in dim situations.  One \"cute\" feature:  the camera detects when your face is near the viewfinder, and can switch between the LCD and the viewfinder just by putting your eye against the viewfinder.<br />The pictures are high quality, what you'd expect from a 5 megapixel camera.  I find that many more of my photos are keepers than with previous cameras.<br />The prices on this camera are good, as its replacement, the 7i (which fixes some of the hassles of this camera), is out at higher cost.  For the money, this one is an excellent buy.","New to digital cameras so bear with me! Plus points 1)very SLR-like in operation; 2)ease of use (up and running in a few mins after batteries charged); 3)uses IBM 1Gb microdrive (who needs a laptop to download to?); 4)superb quality enlargements; 5)ergonomically sound, fits neatly in the hands and NOT too heavy; 6)easy software to use; 7)easy computer connection via USB; 8) Gets quite warm so good for your hands in winter! ---- Minus points 1) EATS batteries!! - you need at least two sets of high capacity NiMH batteries to hand, fully charged. One set of 1600mAh NiMH batteries will only last me about 45mins and that`s mainly using the EVF; 2)lower quality settings give variable quality on photos to e-mail; 3) BIG file sizes if you don`t have a microdrive or handy laptop.<br />Overall I`m very happy with my new purchase but there`s still a lot of experimenting to do with it yet.","After years of SLR photography with Nikon gear, finally made the transition to digital. After much research, purchased a Minolta Dimage 7.<br />It is fantastic! Have used it indoors for rock climbing events, and externally for portrait, flower, snow boarding, skiing, and climbing shots. Only problem is battery life. I get about an hour's life (c. 120 shots) from a set of three nickel-metal hydride batteries.<br />My solution has been to buy three sets of batteries, and purchase a Q2 QUest quick charger that works on either 12 volt car/boat systems, or plugs into home outlets. Batteries are charged in about an hour, as opposed to the multi-hour epic using the charger that is shipped with the camera.<br />Camera is easy to use, and has been an easy transition from SLR's. Using OFOTO, my print and film costs have dropped so much my wife even thinks the camera will pay for itself in a year or so!","I read lots of reviews and handled lots of high-end digital cameras before deciding on the Dimage 7.  I'm not disappointed. The Dimage 7 handles very like a good 35.  The manual zoom, an astounding 28-200mm, provides lots of composition latitude.  All controls are handy and easy to use.  Learning curve is really flat.  Photos are sharper than 35mm film images (when resampled to 300 dpi and printed at a lab).<br />Most complaints seem to be in the power consumption area.  One must understand that battery operated equipment is only as good as the batteries one uses.  By purchasing an extra set of NiMH AA batteries and conditioning them properly, I've had NO problems with lack of available power.  You've got to cycle the batteries through the charger four or five times, after fully draining them, in order for them to go the distance.  I'm getting about 80 to 100 hi-res shots per set.<br />Overall, I'm very pleased with the Dimage 7.  I've even begun a selloff of all my trusted Nikon film cameras.  Digital is finally affordable, dependable, and definitely here to stay.  If you're looking for a digital camera that is easy to operate and delivers consistently great photos, the Dimage 7 will do the job.<br />I'd also recommend Adobe PhotoShop Elements as an affordable, feature-packed photo editing software.  For the money, you can't beat it.","This is my first digicam and it's been keeping me company for 2 months. The main reason that made it stand out from my other choices was the GT lens which Minolta incorporated as a main feature of the company's great return to the digi-world. I had confidence in the lens and it doesn't let me down either. The pictures are stunning in color and sharpness! No doubt about it.<br />However, there are two drawbacks that hinder my rating the camera 5 stars. First, it drains battery so fast. I had to invest on 3 sets of rechargeable 1600 mAh to feel comfortable when hanging out with it. Second, the auto-focus function of the camera can sometimes drive you nuts. It can easily get you the wrong focus when the framed area is inadequately lit, or when you are focusing at a black subject in the spot focus mode.<br />The remaining features of the camera are user-friendly and reliable. I set the image size at 2560 X 1920 and image quality Fine (jpeg format) which retains high resolution while maintaining manageable file size.<br />In view of its remarkable performance, it deserves the \"Prosumer\" categorization.","I just thought it was important to point out that this camera doesn't have a microphone to record audio during movie recording. It's not a big deal, but this website didn't say that anywhere, so I purchased it, and then found out. I haven't received it yet, but I'm still excited. I might have waited for the 7i, but not just for audio. But remember, if audio movie recording is important to you, then don't get this camera!","Where to start.  The pros I guess.  If you take the time to learn the camera it can take some VERY good pictures.  The fact that some people have problems with it, I think, stems from the fact that they don't take the time to learn all the features.  This isn't a point and shoot camera. (Although it does pretty good at that.)  That being said, on to the bad.  The autofocus [is bad]  Really, this is one area that just makes me more mad every time I use it.  If you were just using it for landscape shots or non action shots it would be ok (not great, but ok).  However, if you have to focus on anything that is moving around much (like kids).... Forget it.  Go to manual mode.  One peace of advice... Turn the color adjust up one or two clicks and the images look 200x better.","What a great little camera...compact, lightweight, does<br />everything you'd ever dream of!! Shoots clear, colorful pictures!<br />Shows what your're capturing with little guess work. Helps an amature really get the feel for aperture and shutter controls...allows for bracketing, both exposure and digital enhanced...it's just an awesome purchase!!","Got the Dimage 7 a couple weeks ago. It too came with the Quest NiMh batteries and charger. The 1600 mAh batteries last for 150-200 pictures. Thats about the same I get on my Canon Powershot 100 Elph. Be sure to fully charge your NiMh!<br />Many people get NiMh fast chargers and take the batteries out when the charger say its full. NiMh are difficult to fast charge especially when they are new (am using them for several years). Even the most sophisticated fast chargers will cut off far too soon on new batteries. Make sure you look at the charge time (e.g. 1600mAh(capacity)/500mA(charge current)=~3.2h. So if the charger say it is done after 30min, let them rest for a couple minutes and start charging them again until you reach the total charge time. (Only with empty batteries!)<br />Just came back from a night shooting trip through Vienna (Austria). I have the most amazing 5M pictures in my pocket (ehm-notebook). It is amazing how clear they are. (tripod, iso 100, 4sec, manual focus, night program, rest automatic)<br />A good Compact Flash card is worth the investment. Got a 12x speed Lexar 256MB which holds ~100 pictures in full resolution and fine (jpeg) compression. Be carefull with cheap CF cards that are less than 4x speed. Rule of thumb: If the card does not specify the speed - it is slow and so will be your experience when shooting and transfering pictures.<br />I am using a CF adapater for the notebook instead of the USB cable. Preserves power and is at least 10 times faster in getting the pictures off the card.<br />Hope this helps! Have fun!","4 stars because there is always better!<br />ok you wanna be a pro, well just read the brochure and discover the amazing features pages after pages, I had a Nikon 995 also a great camera very polyvalent but wanted a better performance. The Dimage 7 is perfect for Location shoot I use it with the battery pack or with the AC adapter ...Forget the batteries 1/2 to 1hr it is not like the nikon 1-2 hr<br />...you cannot find a better deal, sorry Canon! Now I am waiting for  the Dimage X for my pocket...<br />Bgood:)","great optics, but I expected better power management, better ability to handle varied light, better focusing, and faster capture after I press the 'shutter release'.","I took this camera on a month-long tour of Europe and it didn't let me down.  Be sure to have plenty of battery power, however, as your 4 LiMH batteries will only enable you to take about 70 pics (equivalent to about 3 hours of on-standby mode).  The manual zoom allows for excellent custom shots, and it saves on your dear power availability.  The programming options are good, and if you prefer customization, you can memorize your own settings.  As for what really matters, the picture quality is superb.  You can really put the 5.2Mpixels to good use, or simply maximize your memory card with lower resultions photos.  Natural light dark shots are excellent with the available ISO 800 setting (manual only).  Highly recommended, but keep in mind the battery time and necessary charging time.","I bought this camera 1 week before Christmas and had it in our trip to Rome. I did ~1000 picture and I don't know better camera now. I had a Nikon 5000 for few days after trip and decided to keep Dimage 7. This is real ZLR camera, very good (and fast) zoom, many manual settings. My camera included Quest rechargable bataries and they work good. I had another set of rechargable batareies and these two sets work for whole day. I had little problem this my old Mr. Flash CF. It doesn't work with Minolta, but new Lexar CF card works fine. Only one negative things I found in Dimage 7. Dimensions are 4:3, but photopapper for my Epson Photo printer has dimension 3:2 and you'll need crop your picture before print. The same problem when you put images to your video. Unfortunately, looks as most advanced digital cameras have this as default, including Nikon and Sony.","What's the point of a 5.24mp camera that has such limited storage space?","After a couple of years owning a Kodak DC290, the Minolta Dimage 7 was a very welcome step-up in digital cameras.<br />  Here's a quick list of the qualities I really like about this camera:<br />The image resolution (It's 4.91 megapixel effective resolution CCD actually allows small details in the picture to be visable and sharp); the acurate colors (once the image is run throught the Minolta Image Viewer utility, which is a necessity to convert the images from it's native Minolta color space to the appropriate desitnations color space; sRGB, ICC profile, AppleRGB, AdobeRGB, etc...); It's great quality zoom lens with it's f2.8 aperature; it's Flex Point focusing (a really great feature); it's use of easy to obtain and relatively inexpensive rechargeable AA NiMh batteries (instead of expensive, and mostly hard to find proprietary batteries that a lot of companies force you to use); it's Electronic Viewfinder (Somehow it doesn't seem right, but the LCD used in the Dimage 7's viewfinder is actually quite good. Somehow it is very close to CTR quality).<br />  There are many small things I like about this camera, but I can't write them all, so here is a list of qualities I dislike, (which is much shorter):<br />Compared to other camera, the Dimage 7 is a battery power hog (Be sure to use good quality 1,600mAh or 1,700mAh NiMh batteries); You have to run your images through the included Image Viewer Utilily or the colors in your images will most likely look dull and flat; and finally, when using the .RAW image format you must wait for the complete image to be written to the CF card BEFORE you can take the next picture (which can be as long as almost a full minute)","My interest in photography has really been renewed since I bought the Dimage 7 two months ago. This camera has incredible flexibility - which was overwhelming at first. But I set up some basic settings (size and quality) and stuck with the minimum controls (shutter speed, aperature, EV, and white balance)to get used to the camera. Now I almost always use manual focus with zoom to fine tune the focus before taking each photo and I've started using ISO settings to help in low light situations. If you are looking to replace your manual focus, manual settings SLR, this is a camera to seriously consider. At 5 megapixels, 8 x 10s are very sharp, and there's room to crop without compromising quality. If you have a point-and-shoot but want to learn about photography, this is a great camera to learn on since the 'film' is endless, mistakes are seen immediately and can be corrected.","WOW! I am really impressed by this camera. But first, lets talk about the battery \"problem\". You must read the documentation that comes with the camera. It clearly says that Alkaline batteries are INADEQUATE for this camera! One thing I really loved is the fact that Minolta, realizing the mistake of shipping the camera with only 4 measly alkalines is now including 4 1600 mAh Nickel Metal Hydride batteries (Quest) AND a charger! this certainly helps. I have been taking photos on RAW quality (similar to TIFF - large transfer times, because of the size) on a 1 GB IBM Microdrive (more power consumption), using the  camera on auto viewfinder/LCD, and 30-40% of these shots I've used the flash.. and am happy to report that the batteries are good for about 40-50 shots (not bad considering the power requirements of this setup). If you use a CFII card and resort to the LCD only ocasionally, the batteries should last you much more than this between charges.<br />Now the photo quality -oh , the quality- this is the BEST picture-quality camera around! the lens is superb, no discernible color aberration or distorion, great color balance and reproduction, especially when using RAW, by far my favorite picture format -don't forget to process your images with the Dimage Image viewer utility!- and the zoom is reaaaly helpful (28-200 35mm equivalent); other cameras zoom pale in comparison.<br />The camera feels solid but light (the magnesium-alloy body can be deceiving, your first impression is that this is plastic, because of the light weight, but no, it is metal)..<br />The controls are intuitive, and I like to have a more tactile control of the camera, using the dials and not having to navigate through a sea of menus. Somehow, this makes me feel that I am using a \"pro\" camera and not a digital toy. (Have you ever tried to change a lot of settings while taking pictures on a Coolpix or a Canon? not easy for large fingers such as mine).<br />The viewfinder? good; not the best solution, since a TTL optical viewfinder would be preferable, but this is the best LCD viewfinder I have seen, and a decent alternative to the main LCD; one advantage is that you can see all of the control information on the viewfinder. Of course, if you want an optical TTL viewfinder you can go for the newest 5 megapixel Olympus, but it will cost you about more!<br />About the only negative comment I have of this camera is the flimsy plastic covers for the Video out jacks. It doesn't seal tight and sometimes it can crack a little open. Not a show-stopper, though. Also, the plastic cover for the batteries. I hope it proves to be durable, but certainly a metal one would have been much more preferable, especially since you will need to change batteries quite frequently (every 50-70 shots).<br />This camera feels good in your hand.<br />In summary, this is the BEST 5 megapixel camera you can buy, but haven't had the chance to evaluate the Olympus E20N. The picture quality is superb, the lens system is excellent and in general, this is a well-designed product. Kudos to minolta for creating such a great product.","I have one and its great i the batteries they gave me didn't last long but i read the instructions and bought a fast recharger and nickel batteries not litium. Thats everyones problem they bought the worong batteries. the ones amazon is selling are also not the write ones. Go to a higgh end carera shop to pick them up the rechargebals coast about 30.00 but last over an hour with the lcd screen. The picture quality is great and i loe it and for the people who took it back. You dont know what your missing. ps. The batteries they give you only last two shots so get the wirte batteries and recharger cause thiers takes foever and it will work great.","The manual functions, 7x zoom and amazing quality of pictures are the reasons why I gave this camera 5 stars.  Sure alkaline batteries in this thing are a joke, but with some 1600 mAh AA NiMH batteries and a fast charger ... I get 150+ shots per set of batteries (30% flash).  Buy another set on batteries at [price]and you have more power for a days outing than you need.  Kudos to Minolta for not chaining the consumer to a proprietary LiOH battery.","Hi All<br />Have been reading some of the reviews about this camera and agree with most.<br />Although some people seem to be dissatisfied with the battery life of this camera, my experience is as follows.<br />When I bought my Dimage 7 I was told that the batteries with the camera were for \"testing only\" and was advised to buy some<br />Ni Mh . Bought 3 sets of 15000mah...and auto charger...This extra out-lay is annoying but well worth it. Have any of the complainants bothered to price spare proprietary batteries for some of the other cameras? Could be in for a shock.<br />Have been using the camera for work to photograph houses and take  70 photos aday, about 30% of these are with flash (inside).<br />One set of batteries lasts for 100 photos. This is trying to use the electronic view finder as much as possible, even to review and delete photos.<br />The battery sets get charged and rotated regularly allowing me to carry two sets and this gives me ample battery life.<br />I can only say  I'am so impressed with the results achieved with this camera that when it was stolen from my car a few days B4 Xmas I had to replace it with the same.<br />Good points:<br />Easy to use,takes great photos,light weight,versatile,uses readily available AA's, cheap memory and can use micro drive.<br />Negetives:<br />Expensive,focusing takes getting used to,target for theft, insurance.","Sony has a long history of pushing proprietary formats that just don't quite work out.  (Think BetaMax)  Memory Sticks are a rather ridiculous technology that have NO justifiable reason for existence.  Are they in any way innovative?  No.  They're a crippled and expensive storage solution.  The F707 is badly crippled by its inability to use 256MB+ CF cards and 1GB MicroDrives.<br />If you take a lot of pictures, this is one hellishly expensive camera.  Memory sticks cost two to three times as much as equivalent compactflash cards, and many photographers will find that they need at least two or three of them.<br />Make no mistake, this is a VERY nice camera.  But the lack of a competent storage option cripples it.","The best of this camera is the Lense the optical zoom, and the quality of the 5.5MP sensor, but the batteries empty in minutes, and the Auto focusing is not fast enougth, and I don't Like the SLR digital.  Spanish: Lo mejor de la camara es el lente con el zoom optico y la calidad del sensor de 5.5MP, pero las baterias se gastan en minutos -muy pocos- y el autoenfoque es muy lento y deficiente, y el visor SLR digital no me gusto realmente, creo que el consumidor debe optar por otro modelo, ya que el precio de este es elevado.","I would like to start with the 5.2 Meg pixals. I always shot my pictures with the highest quality. After I get the picture I want I normally reduce it to a size depending on what the picture is going to be used for. I limit my web and email pictures to 1 meg but my show pictures I use the whole 9 yards. The outcome is as good as film and most of the time better. Next the color. (To use the full color you will have to use other software.) Minotla has added extra color to the picture to ensure you can have all the color you need. You may not need it but it is there. When I shoot something in color I want to see the color that I shot not something close to it. Last is the batterys. I use a battery pack that has 5 NiMH batterys in it. It provides the power I need to spend the day shooting. The camera now comes with NiMH batterys and charger but I wanted more. As for the flash card that comes with it I wanted to pick my own cards and Im glad they didn't increase the price to include a card I would not have used anyway. I wanted a fast large card and that would not be the card included anyway. If you want to shoot great pictures you can do it with this camera. You will have to buy some more accessories but in the long run I think you will find you can do just about anything you want with this camera.","the dimage 7 is remarkable. nothing even comes close to its superiority over all other digital cameras. it is an easy camera to learn to operate & well balanced. i own a minolta 35mm. with ex.telephoto lenz & dimage 7 is just as good.","This camera is excellent in every way except one (which I mention at the end.)  The quality of the images out-weighs every camera in its class.  And, it gives full control of most every camera feature.<br />Like others have said, you need to use NiMHi batteries.  And, you must purchase a larger CF card.  I would recommend at least a 128MB card.  And, for each 128MB card, a set of 4 AA NiMHi batteries and a charger.  For downloading, spend (several dollars) and get a CF to USB reader.  You'll be glad you did.<br />The only problem I have is that it doesn't have a PC socket.  I had to invest $100 in a DigiSlave SA-10 unit so I could use the DiMage 7 with my studio slaves.  (...)","I like the Dimage line and have very favorably reviewed the Dimage 5, which is essentially the same camera without the 5 megapixel capability of the Dimage 7. This enhanced resolution adds nearly 50% to the price. What it offers, in short, is the ability to enlarge photos taken on the Dimage 7 to poster size without their losing clarity. Basically, that's it. On the negative side, images recorded in 5 meg mode take longer to write (i.e. the camera is 'busy' longer btwn shots), it uses far more battery power, it occupies ungodly amts of space on memory cards, and it make files so large that they can only feasibly be sent via email if both parties have exceptionally fast connections and can only be posted to websites if the viewer has a very fast connection to open it. Other site viewers would be waiting an eternity to view your images. It's a fine camera, but most users will be dialing down its resolution to below that of the Dimage 5, while still paying a hefty premium. I decided to pass and get the 5, (...)","This camera has most of the 35mm features that you would want in a digital camera.  It is easy to learn and takes great pictures.  There are edit features in the camera that make pictures ready to print straight from the memory card.  This is a camera to love!","The good:  high resolution allows a lot of cropping; 28mm and 200mm wide and tele settings are MUCH better than the 35mm and 105mm found on most other cameras; plenty of adjustments.  For instance, it's got matrix, spot, and center-weighted metering, and I've used them all. If you are an advanced amateur and really enjoy digital photography, this is a great camera. It was designed for you.<br />The not-so-good:  like ALL digital cameras, this is not as sophisticated as the current crop of 35mm SLRs.  For instance, the focus is slower, and it's hard to use for studio/flash work. If you don't like reading camera manuals, buy another camera.  To get the best results, you must be prepared to tinker.","To my mind, a camera should be a tool, not a participant. I love this camera, because it does whatever you tell it to do, and doesn't frustrate you with a lot of \"smart\" features. I had a 35mm camera once with \"autofocus\"-- so-called \"point-and-shoot,\" and it drove me crazy, because half the time, it didn't focus on what I actually wanted in the picture.<br />This camera gives the user total control of light, aperture and zoom. In addition, because there's no film involved, you can shoot day or night without having to worry about the speed of you film. And by the way, it takes great twilight and night pictures!<br />All the adjustments are two handed, so it's like liquid; you don't have to adjust and check, adjust and check, go back and adjust again, etc. It's a quicker way to what you want.<br />Now I'll admit that's a personal preference; it's like stick shift vs. automatic-- some people are passionate about one or the other. Some people love point-and-shoot. If you're one, then this probably isn't the camera for you.<br />The camera has 5 megapixel resolution, which means that you can print poster size reproductions of your shots, or crop tiny portions, enlarge then, and have them look really good. This is a photoshop type of camera, a camera for someone who likes to play with images.<br />There are a few drawbacks:<br />It takes almost a minute for the picture to store, so if you want to take photojournalistic shots, like athletes in action, hitting the shutter as fast as you can move your finger, this isn't the right camera.<br />Also, as with just about any computer tool, you have to buy accessories. It comes with two alkaline batteries, which struck me as strange, because I didn't think that could be sufficient, but I thought \"Hey, if the manufacture includes them....\" I was right the first time. Fortunately, I already had some NiMH rechargeables, and they last for 60-70 shots. There's an adapter for indoor use as well, although I don't have one. You're going to want to buy an additional memory card too. I got the Viking 128 meg CF, and I like it.<br />Because of the high resolution, e-mailing or posting images takes a long time, and people who receive them will have a long wait on the download. Of course you can always print the image, and then scan it in, which is what I've done. Believe it or not, the scanned images from this camera actually look better than scanned actual photographs. This is probably because I've played with them, and gotten them to look good on screen before I've printed them. I've also used the highest quality photo-finish paper I could find.<br />I'm very happy with this camera. A camera is an individual thing, though. Before you buy, think through exactly what you want, and buy the camera that suits you. If you want outdoor nature shots and architectural shots at all times of day and night, portrait shots, and candid shots, and want to print them as album photos, and want to be able to crop, adjust color, and cut and paste, this is a great camera.","This is my first digital camera and I am thrilled.  I have been a 35mm hobby photographer for 30 years and feel I will never use film again.  You can easily point and shoot with spectacular results.  I' ve had mine two months and have only scratched the surface of the possibilities as I learn it's creative features.  You MUST \"process\" each photo on your computer with the included DiMage Image processing software before every picture can be called perfect.  The included four alkaline AA batteries died in five minutes, long enough for a counter salesman to verify the basic features are funtioning.  I bought a NiMH charger and four sets to four rechargeable NiMH batteries.  The include flash is great but I also bought the external flash and two 256MB compact flash cards (...)  I feel I got what I paid for.  (...) Once I figured out all the possiblities for misunderstanding what does what, I was amazed by the picture quality.  I notice details and color differences in pictures that make me go back and look at the original subject a second time.  The photos do not lie.  I love it.(...)","Bought the DiMage 7 and truly love it. I agree with some of the pundits that the AF isn't always accurate, but so far it hasn't been nearly as bad as many have said. The camera takes great photographs. That alone is worth it. I have not noticed the camera getting hot near the CF door. Perhaps it will with extended use, but I am not a professional. Therefore, I rarely shoot for hours on end. Prior to buying, I sampled several cameras, including the Sony (5 MP), the G2, and the Fuji 6900. Only the G2 made me waiver a bit. In the end, I chose the D7 and am glad I did. The camera has everything for the novice, experienced, or semiprofessional photographer. Of course the price reduction has made it a much better option.","I like this camera. I'm what I call a professional amateur with lots of cameras. I've been taking pictures for 36 years with several different point and shoot, seven different Nikons, the Hasselblad 500 C/M, and now with a handful of digital. I've used an original Casio (<<1meg), an original Sony Mavica (<1meg), a Kodak DC290 (2.1), the Olympus C2100 (2.1), and now the Minolta Dimage 7 (5.24), which I chose instead of the Olympus E-10 (4meg). The most important thing I've learned is that there is no perfect camera, not even the Hasselblad. Every camera has good and bad things, it's up to the photographer to figure out how best to use each camera for the particular subject matter.<br />The first thing you need to fix with the Dimage 7 is the power supply. I solved this problem with the QB1+ battery pack  and the MDC4 power cord  from Quantum  I also got the MDC2 power cord  so I can use the QB1+ with my Kodak DC290 and Olympus C2100, and in case I get the Olympus E-20 and Nikon 5000 for Christmas. With AA batteries, I usually only got 20 pics. With the QB1+, I don't know how many pics I get because I've shot more than 200, all with flash, with the view set to auto so it's always switching between the screen and view finder, with using the quick view, with switching between capture and review modes, and I still have more that half the charge.<br />The next thing is a filter for the lens. I put a 49mm B+W skylight filter on, but at wide angles (28-35), the edge of the filter ring shows up on the top left corner of the image. You no longer see it when you get to 50mm and above. One way to fix this problem is to crop that part of the image out in Photoshop. Another way is to not use a filter. That makes me uncomfortable. I'm going to go ahead and use a filter, and when I need the 28-35mm shot, I'll just back up a little more to leave enough room to crop out the filter ring.<br />The auto focus is slow and not very good, which means high speed actions shots are almost out. Shooting manual at infinity works just fine. One way to put more of the subject at the infinity range is to up the ISO to 400 or 800. That moves where infinity starts. Another trick is to us small apertures, which for this camera is either 6.7 or 8, in combination with the ISO. When I do use the manual focus ring, I use the screen instead of the viewfinder. When I use the auto focus, I always use the spot focus instead of the area focus. One trick I use when I'm taking picture of my buddies playing pool, is to use the spot auto focus, pick out an average distance, get the focus, then switch to manual focus. The Dimage 7 has the ability to range with the auto focus and then remember that range when to switch to manual. I take a handful of shots, re-range using the spot auto focus, switch back go manual, and take another handful of shots. I keep the good ones and delete the bad ones. I do the same thing with high speed action shots. I pick out some average distance, range with spot auto focus, switch to manual, and shot the action as it goes by. If you wait for the auto focus, you'll never get the shot.<br />For memory, I prefer the Viking 128 meg CF. It holds 60-70 pics at size 2560 and quality Fine, which is where I like to shoot. You can get the 128 at Amazon now for only ... plus a rebate which takes it down to ... It's a great deal and I've never had a bad one. I take five of them with me when I go out, which gives me 300-350 shots per day. Forget about downloading images from the camera. Take the CF out of the camera and use a Zio! reader from Microtech.<br />The really nice thing about the Dimage 7 is not only the 5.24 meg image, but the 12 bit analog to digital converter. Both of these things combined means that the image has a ton of information for color corrections. I don't know yet what the Olympus E-20 or the Nikon 5000 has for A/D conversion, but if it's not 12 or more bits, I may save my money and not buy either one. The size of the A/D converter is very important and should not be under estimated. With that much information, I can make a very wide range of color corrections when I get the image into Photoshop. Then I send it off to Ofoto.com to get magnificent $4 8x10's. Believe me, I've spent... to ... for an 8x10 at custom photo labs, and I'm very happy with the quality of a digital image on a ... Ofoto.com 8x10. Plus, I don't even have to leave my house to get it.<br />Bottom line, although the Dimage 7 may not be for everyone, I like it. It won't replace either my Nikon F5 or my Hasselblad 500 C/M, but it does make a very nice addition. I'll keep it, especially now that I have the QB1+ battery pack.<br />P.S., You can see some of my images at ...","This camera compares favourably to anything else out there at any price.<br />Wonderful images.  You can print out near poster sized photos.  Or if you're like me, and don't always get everything perfect, you can crop the image quite a bit and still print out perfect pictures at 11x8.<br />The camera feels well constructed and nice in the hands.  It's made of aluminum and so remains nice and light while still real strong.  The buttons are logically placed, but there are alot of them.<br />The camera does well with just point and shoot, but has all the indepth controls experianced camera buffs who prefer to control every little detail themself.<br />It uses industry standard batteries and memory so cost of ownership will be low.<br />Much lower then the nearly equal Sony DSC707 which relies on propriatary pieces which are far more costly and more difficult to find.<br />It can use over the counter AA batteries in a pinch, but some nice recharable 1800mh would work alot longer.<br />Compact Flash is the best memory option avialable.  It costs less, comes in larger capacities, and is higher performance then Sony's Memory Stick or Smart Media type memory.<br />The camera is not perfect.<br />The view finder is the best of it's type.  Better then the Sony DSC707 or the Fuji MX6900, but it is not as good as the true optical viewfinder on the much more expensive Nixon D1x or that class of camera (cost 2x-6x as much and are not as easy to use).<br />It uses batteries up fast.  The solution is simple get some high capacity batteries and condition them.  This means you have to fully charge and discharge the batteries several times.. So the first few times the batteries won't last too long, but after a few uses this will correct itself.<br />You should also get a larger Compact Flash memory card, 128mb or faster.  And don't get the cheapest cards out there, as they are much slower.<br />(...)  Just rememeber the faster the card, the less you have to wait between shots.<br />The only other real strike against this camera is that by default it records the photos in a non-standard color space.  The effect of this is that the colors  can be muted.  There is a simple work around.  Minolta has a piece of software they give you which can be used to move the images color space into the normal range for sRGB on those images that would benifit from this.<br />Good with the bad, this is a truely wonderful camera.  While not perfect it is probably as close as it gets right now.<br />No one should buy a camera unless they have looked at least a few others.  Other cameras to look at would be the Sony DSC707, Canon G2, Olympus E-10/E-20, Olympus 4040 and later when it's released the Nikon 5000.  But I think the D7 will probably still have the best over all mix of features, ease of use, low cost, low cost of operation, etc.","My camera decision came down between the Dimage 7 and the Olympus E-10. My former camera was a Fuji MX2900.<br />I wanted two things in the new camera: SLR design and feel and pixels! I wanted a digicam that can truly replace my film SLR.<br />The Dimage 7 was a bit more affordable than the E-10 and beat it in nearly every technical spec. What finally sold me was the zoom capability of the D-7, its wider range of shutter speeds, and wide range of manual options.<br />Shortcomings: Everyone moans about battery consumption and it's warranted. Do not buy this camera unless you also get NiMH rechargeables. Alkalines are good for 15 minutes. In my opinion, the biggest shortcoming of the D-7 is the autofocus speed. I have a toddler who does not like to sit still, and the D-7 simply cannot keep up. I agree with those who say an AC adapter should be included, especially since it is a very hard accessory to find. A minor annoyance that didn't appear in the brochure is that the video function does not collect sound. Not a dealbreaker, but someone out there will want to know.<br />Bottom line - I think it's a great camera. It takes excellent pictures in any lighting condition, has a great built in flash (red-eye reduction that actually works!), and feels like a real camera. Oh, did I mention that it takes great pictures??","The is an awesome digital camera that often takes photos of better quality than 35mm film cameras.<br />The 4 things that I can't stand about the camera:<br />1.  Power hog:  When using high capacity nickel metal hydride batteries, they only last about 20 to 50 pictures,  depending on the resolution that you're using, the autofocus, and the flash.  Don't even THINK about using the rear display screen.  The power indicator often indicates a low battery when in fact you may have 10 or more shots left.  I use 3 sets of batteries!<br />2.  The electronic viewfinder's pixelated resolution makes it difficult to tell whether the subject is in focus.<br />3.  The autofocus can be infuriatingly slow at times, sometimes can't focus, and sometimes tells you that the subject is in focus when it's not (I mostly use the focus by wire focusing ring for manual focus).<br />4.  The neck strap attachment ring on the right side of the camera gets in the way of opening and closing the compact flash door (just annoying).<br />Don't even think of downloading pics through the supplied USB cable (very slow).  I highly reccommend the Zio USB CF reader (transfer rates of ~1MB/S).<br />Still, it's the highest quality camera for the buck right now.","This is my first digital camera and it is great. The programing is not dificult. Images are outstanding, sharp and good color. The image transfer from camera to computer is easy. When run through Photoshop and printed out on Epsons 1270 you get a truly photo quality like result.","I bought this camera reciently, my first digital experience.  Once I got used to the adjustments I was able to take very high quality pictures.  the viewfinder isn't perfect, but for the money I dare anyone to finde a higher quality camera.  Also, the case on the camera IS NOT PLASTIC.  It is made of magneseum, a space age alloy which is extremely strong and lightweight.  The reviews knocking the camera for it's cheap construction show little time was taken to really know the camera.  Battery performance, blah blah blah.  get some rechargeables and you're set.","I purchased the camera in Aug. to take pictures of my new grandchild.  The pictures in the camera and on the viewfinder were excellent.  However the 15 pictures i took, took 12 batteries to take.  The next problem I encountered was trying to get the pictures out of the camera and on to my computers.  I have a large family and we have 5 computers at home.  Each of us tried to retrieve the photos.  No luck, so I called customer service in NJ.  They let me know very quickly that I didn't know what I was doing with a computer and spent the next hour and a half trying to tell me how to get the pictures out.  After that time they concluded I needed to sent the camera in.  I did.  Ten days later I get the camera back saying everything was OK.  Still NO PICTURES.  I call customer service, they again inform me that I was less than intelligent and took another hour to find they too could not get the pictures out of the camera.  Again I sent the camera back.  Guess what, it got lost.  Between UPS and Minolta someone has my camera.  When I called Minolta they have no idea where it was.  Finally UPS said it will pay for a new camera.  Now I go to a dealer in Ft. Wayne with my pictures in the card reader and say,\"If you can get the pictures out of the card by using the NEW Dimage-7 , I will buy it.\"  They could not get them out either.  When I called Minolta and told them this they said the dealer didn't know what they were doing either.  Since the price of the camera had been reduced $200.00 from the time I purchased my camera I asked for that much as a inconvience.  I was told, no way.  You can buy the new one for $1,299.00.  I think I will Pass on the second time around.  Good Luck Dimage - 7 buyers","The Quality of the pictures is excellent but a camera like this should not be sold with a 16 MB memory card and it should have a rechargeable power pack. The recommended ( and supplied) batteries are enough for 8 MB if you use the display and about 14 MB if you only use the view finder. The rechargeable batteries are even less useful. I did not find the external power pack in your accessory list. This may solve the problem although it would be cumbersome to use an external power pack. The lens hood falls off if you are not careful as it has no locating device in forward or reverse mode.<br />The Zoom is outstanding and the digital zoom makes this camera an excellent tool to take shots of fare away objects. Easy to use but with many useful features to find if you take the time.<br />The rubber protector of the view finder comes loose and breaks.","The Dimage 7 came highly recommended by a number of contacts within the industry. The concensus was that this was a pro-prosumer camera and if I was not easily intimidated by it's complexity I'd love it's output. They weren't kidding! I've spent hours getting to know this camera and have barely scratched the surface. It's really amazing and runs circles around the 3 other digitals I own. I was warned that the Dimage consumes a lot of power......that's an understatement! The solution is a healthy collection of 1600 ma Nimh rechargables and a high speed 8-cell charger. Radio shack supplies both.","I purchased my Minolta Dimage 7 when I was in Japan about 3 months ago. I have been using it ever since without any written instructions. Very easy to get up to speed with all the functions. Only issue is battery usage if you do not use Ni-Mh batteries.","my third digital camera great pictures great zoom that why I bought it takes a little getting used to because it like using a real camera.  I have found no faults yet and have taken about 300 pictures works well it 1g mircdrive.  I would buy again with reservation.","I just received this camera and am more than impressed with the quality of the images it produces. A side by side comparison of the same shot on my Nikon Coolpix 990 and the new Minolta clearly told the tale. The Nikon picture is good when blown up to 8 x 10 inches, but you can still discern pixelization. The Minolta Dimage 7 picture with its 5.2 million pixels is truly film quality. I haven't blown one up past the 8 x 10 test yet, but the first results are superb. I like the fineness of the Magnesium alloy case; it's very lightweight but has a feeling of quality. The controls are clearly marked and very intuitive. I did experience a problem with the camera telling me batteries were drained when they weren't; opening and reclosing the battery chamber seemed to correct the mistake. The image in the viewfinder seems awkward now, maybe it will take getting used to. Overall, the image quality cannot be faulted and the camera is an incredably good value at the price it is being offered at. I look forward to getting really used to the camera. Basically, a good job by the engineers at Minolta.","I just received this camera and am more than impressed with the quality of the images it produces.

I have had the camera over a week and must say this is the most incredible digital camera I have owned to date.  Note I have 3 other digital cameras with the Nikon Coolpix 990 being the most recent but none of them come close to the Dimage 7.  The images are absolutely amazing and it has to be one of the simplest digital cameras to operate.  The only suggestion I have to be sure to purchase rechargeable batteries that are at least 1600MA to get the best performance.  Looks like Minolta really has a winner here.","I wanted to send you a brief note and say thank you for shipping me my new Minolta Dimage 7 so quickly.

I used the batteries that the Dimage 7 said were done in my Nikon 990 and was able to take about 25 more photos with the Nikon.  The Minolta is useless on vacation unless you want to carry 50+ batteries.(minus 1 star) Also - that viewfinder is absurd - it is almost impossible to make out details while looking through it.(minus 1 star) Great lens - nice megapixels - good manual controls - it's ashamed the two things above are so poor. ....","The Good: The concept and design of this camera is great. It is a compact, high resolution camera with a fabulous 28-200 mm lens. The controls are very well laid out and allow access to many functions without having to scroll thru multiple tiny menus. Image size (resolution), compression level, and bracketing, for example, are readily accessable. You can bracket not only exposure, but also contrast and color saturation. The camera produces high quality, high resolution images. Color balence, contrast, exposure, and focusing are excellent.<br />The Bad: The camera body and lens are made from a silver plastic that unfortunately has the look and feel of a cheap toy. Some of the controls have a similar feel to them. Admittedly this is an aesthetic observation, but for me was a disappointment in an expensive camera.<br />The Ugly: This camera is not an optical SLR. Instead of a prism and mirror it has an Electronic View Finder (EVF). It seemed like an OK concept to me. After all, that's what my video cameras use. Unfortunately, the device in this camera seems primitive. To my eye the view is pixilated, low resolution, and very streaky with panning and zooming. Also, the color and contrast are somewhat altered. The overall effect is a view thru the viewfinder that seems unreal. It is not quite as noticable on close objects, or portrates, but on landscapes I found the view to be very distracting. Anyone who is accustomed to the killer view of your subject that you get with any good SLR is going to be disappointed. A final item that may just be a defect in the particular camera I had: Randomly the camera would decide that the batteries were dead and shut itself off. To get it back on required opening and shutting the battery compartment.<br />In summary, this is potentially a great high performance digital camera, but I don't think it is quite ready for prime time yet.","I have two other digital cameras, a point and shoot 1.3 mgpx that I quickly retired, and a Nikon Coolpix 950, which I enjoyed for over a year but was constantly grumbling about its lack of manual control.  As my photography hobby became more serious I decided to investigate some of the prosumer cameras, and I heard about Minolta's new camera.  I got the Dimage 7 two days ago and I am still marvelling at how much it is like my old film SLR.<br />Initially I was intimidated by all the dials and buttons, they are literally everywhere!  But as I learned the layout, making adjustments to the settings became very intuitive.  I realized too that, for every button, I had another way of customizing my shots.  I had read online reviews about the zoom lens being stiff, and I agree it is.  It is not as nimble as I'd like, but it isn't terrible either.  The only other gripes I have are the battery consumption (hello, adapter?) and Minolta's 16mb flash card (didn't anyone at Minolta think that would be totally inadequate for someone needing a 5 mgpx camera?)  Otherwise I think the Dimage 7 is great, it shoots dazzling and sharp pics that print perfectly in 8 X 10 and definitely worth the price!","This is it folks, the camera for the rest of us. Great ergo feel, right weight, takes a full size flash, and yes, size does matter: 5.2 megapixels.

We were delighted to find an upgraded Sony Mavica model for her and it was a great replacement gift!  The price was excellent, the online description was perfect, it was shipped immediately and exactly as promised.  We tested the camera before sending to Mom (leaving a few photos of us) -- but we know she will love her new camera!  This seller took extra care in packing the goods by inserting into a plastic bag & double bubble wrapping - he included all the parts & pieces ... even tossed in some extra discs & hard to find software.  The shipping was more costly than posted but we didn't have to pay extra charges - thanks for that!  If we need another camera -- we'll look for his camera site first!  Thanks for making our Birthday Mom very happy.... we can't get her to switch to a new smaller camera - but finding the old style for her 83 year old hands was a treat for all of us!!!","This was my first digital camera. I still have it and use it when I want to take close ups of flowers or whatever. The small file size is ideal to transfer through dial up. I know, cyber out of touch. For closeup I'd rather have this camera than a more expensive one. One drawback is that most computers only come with usb's and without floppy drive. No problem, I have a usb floppy drive. Never really thought about hard copy problems. I do know that this file size is good for sellign online because of the faster upload time. A battery charge lasts forever. It is clunky by today's standards. I'm glad I have it.","I'm a technophobe with limited computer and digital photography skills.  Found an old Mavica in the file cabinet at work.  Invested eight bucks in a battery and charger from ebay, badda bing, badda boom, look ma, I'm a digital photographer!  Floppy disc goes rignt into the PC..no, they don't hold a lot of pix.  Image quality is pretty good (I'm a fisherman, so mostly I take pictures of some goofball holding a fish).  I've taken worse pictures with better digicams, so I'm happy with this camera.  Or was.  My little freebie Mavica got wet...with salt water.  Even though they're big and bulky, they're idiot proof and I'm thinking about shopping for another one on-line.","I acquired one unit in 2002 in Nigeria....and I love The Common Sense Aspect of the Floppy Drive. I used it in Liberia during the War and my MAVICA got wounded....I took it to China in 2006 and got it Fixed....And right now my Hero is here with me Still Taking Pictures for my every day Needs.<br /><br />Sony Mavica ...you are my Hero !!!!","I bought my Sony MVCD75 MAVICA in the last century and am still using it for Ebay and family pictures.  The 10x ZOOM on this camera is incredible.  I put an antique campaign button on Ebay and you could read the fine print on the back/inside edge as if it were large print! (I couldn't even tell what it was until I had taken the picture!) One major advantage over a camera with higher pixel rating is that shots taken with this 3 pixel (MP) MAVICA download much more quickly onto the Ebay and Email page.  You don't have to wait for the picture to show up!  (Just hold your pics to a size that is not extravagant.) The floppy feature is great because you can erase (delete) and re-use the same floppy forever!<br /><br />For serious nature shots (esp. birds) you will want to go with a camera that has a higher pixel rating - 5 MP or more; even though for everyday shots, in the yard or at a fairground, etc. the MVCFD75 MAVICA will be fine.  Outdoors, the sun can create interference when you try to see into the viewer but you can shade it with your hand or buy the hood attachment originally made for this purpose.  (I just never purchased that attachment.)  If you can buy the MVCFD75 MAVICA for less than $200, go for it!<br /><br />- John K./Dallas","This is a fantastic Camera!  Camera has a huge 2.5 \" screen and motion sensory is in real time (no choppy delay when looking at the screen).  It's VERY easy to use.  Even though this camera is now old for the industry standards it takes Beautiful pictures.  No need to mess with USB ports or downloads.  Pictures save directly on the disk in the camera.","I agree 1000% with the other 2 reviewers, the Mavica Camera is an excellent choice for anyone who sells on Ebay or to send e-mail pictures.. All my friends make fun of how big and bulky it is but hey, I like it and the quality of the pics are very good .. Its so easy to use, you put the pics on a floppy, make files for whatever subject you want.. All the kids names , my cars, nature etc. just download the pics from the floppy to the file and its done, the floppy is clean and everything is on your hard drive.. I own 2 Collector Cars and I go to a lot of car shows and cruise ins and I am always taking pics of cars , truck & bikes.. I have owned a FD 73 for at least 7 years and an FD 75 for about 2 years and I love them both.. I paid over $ 500.00 for the first one but it was worth every penny :) Its also invaluable for my Ebay Business, very easy to use for that as well.. If you get a chance to pick one up (even if you already own one of those 1 million pixel cameras) do it, you won't regret it.. Thanks Pete C.","I originally reviewed this camera March '01 and just found my review on a web search. I gave it a \"5\" and still do - easy to use and great price.  The floppies save you from crawling around hooking stuff behind the computer  - always a nightmare in MY office!  For online selling the pics are great, closeups are the only letdown and if you are very careful you can do \"ok\" but not great.  Still a big bang for the buck and it's been A+++ for function, not a problem ever and I'm a heavy user.  A solid buy, you could do much worse!","I'm no techie and like things simple, straightforward and easy to use.  This camera fits the bill.  I limit digital photography to web usage, sending pics via email, looking at pics on my computer or TV via DVD player, posting pics on eBay and hobby websites, etc. and this camera is perfect for those purposes.  The use of floppy discs is particularly nice and so is the outstanding macro/close-up capability.  If you plan to blow up pics fairly large and print them, a higher resolution camera may be preferable, but for 95% of my needs this camera is perfect and so much easier to use than my wife's fancy, expensive, high resolution camera with more of bells and whistles.","The camera is very convenient but if the light is not bright enough the image does not show on the screen, so pictures are hard to take centered or in focus.","I bought this camera at $300 for my web-based business.  The deciding factor was it's ability to write directly to floppy disks which saves time and memory downloading to my laptop computer.  The advantage of this camera is it's versatility in picture storage.  The typical memory card is also available.<br />The picture quality is excellent for a 2 megapixal camera.  It meets and exceeds the requirements for photo-editing for web content.  Using photoshop 7.0 is simple with imports from disk on this camera which saves me using hard drive space for stages in production.<br />The disadvantage to this camera is it's size and weight.  I took it on my most recent visit to Europe and felt that I needed a pullman bag just to accomadate my camera.  I originally thought that it's size would be outweighed (no pun intended) by it's advantage of floppy format, thereby saving the need to buy expensive memory cards.  It doesn't however.  I bought a small digital camera with higher pixel ability for travel which suit my needs much better. I would recommend this for anyone who wants 35 mm quality. Taking my laptop is as easy as taking the mavica.<br />Again, if your usage is web based, the mavica cannot be beat.  I would reconsider if you want an easy camera for travel/everyday pictures.  The size and print quality is not feasible.<br />--Kathryn White-Fidram","This camera puts your snapshots onto a floppy diskette which is not possible with a 3 or 4 megapixel camera which all the reviews seem to agree is the minimum you should buy, but who needs 20x30 inch photos? I love this camera! Goodness, what is with the reviews that claim you need at least 3 megapixels? None of us can print a 20x30 photo at home, and even if we could it would use up all your ink! I expect my MVC-FD75 (the 'FD' is for Floppy Disk)to keep me happy for many years - at least as long as I can still buy 1.4M floppy diskettes. Don't buy it if your computer has no floppy diskette drive, but live a long happy life with it otherwise. It's a great camera.","I recieved this camera in May 2001 as a graduation gift right before leaving the country for 6 months abroad.  I can't say enough good things about the Mavica--I literally took it around the world and captured some amazing sights along they way--and was able to share all of them with friends and family all over the world.  The floppy disks make on the go transfer and trasmission extremely easy--any internet cafe will do.  The quality of the pictures online is great although when I've printed them, I haven't been quite as pleased.  Although the camera is a bit bulky, it isn't too much of a hastle to travel with and the rechargeable battery is a wonderful feature.  In all, I highly recommend this camera for anything except prints--you can get decent 4 x 6 photos but the quality isn't what you'd like it to be.  Just the same, it's a great camera with an outstanding zoom and enormous versatility.","I purchased this camera over a year ago.  I choose this camera because of the floppy disk.  It is far cheaper than buy the extra menory chip for other cameras.  The easy of taken pictures on a floppy makes it the best camera for long back woods hiking trips or just being away from a computer.  Just install a new floppy and your ready to go.  Also i really like the disk copy feature where you can download the pictures into the camera and make a second disk for a freind.  Other features areeasy to lean.  The camera has one of the best Zooms 10X really get up close to the action.","About three years after Sony introduced the Mavica MVC-FD75, the price finally came down enough for me to buy one on sale ...in 2002. I have been extremely happy with this little camera in all that it can do!<br />I was a professional photographer with my own studio for many years and I find little fault with the Mavica camera. I highly recommend it whether you are just beginning or are a seasoned expert.<br />The main and most important feature for me is that I can both shoot and store all my photos on floppy disks, thus insuring that I can ALWAYS easily print from any computer and any source without fussing over memory cards and compatibility or plugging the camera into a computer.  The Mavica gives you great flexibility in this regard and my photos are always backed up both on floppies and other media if I choose.<br />\"Picture Effects\" offer choices of black & white, sepia, solarised,or negative modes and give the amateur easy imaging options with just clicking on the \"Effects\" button.<br />Viewing your photos is very easy, just scroll through individual photos or view with the index, which shows 6 thumbnails at a time.<br />Depending on the mode chosen, \"Standard\" or \"Fine\" you'll get anywhere from 10 to 30+ exposures per 1.4mg floppy disk.  \"Standard\" works well for most shots and \"Fine\" gives you clear, sharp images with good color balance.  You can add a polarising filter (recommended for all lenses!) and increase color control through appropriate filtration.<br />Copying a photo or the complete disk is also very easy, just choose from the menu what you want to copy...<br />You can choose from several auto-modes (fast action, low-light, bright light, etc.) protect files from accidental erasure, adjust exposure levels manually, add polarising and other filters and lenses, adjust the screen brightness, time-stamp your photos, and other goodies; and the Mavica FD75 does very well at close-up photography as well.<br />Altogether, a good choice for anyone wanting an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand camera with a floppy disk capability.  The quality overall is excellent and I have been tremendously pleased with it and so will you!","This camera is......wow.<br /><br /> I was surprised by this camera. Since it was so bulky, I thought it was just a peice of trash.....How wrong was I?¿<br /><br /> Pros:<br /> 10X zoom (A GREAT feature to have)<br /> Different picture types<br /> Uses floppy disk (saves money from buying EXPENSIVE memory sticks)<br /><br /> Cons:<br /> Takes a while to charge<br /> After you charge it, if you use it for about more than 1 hour, it starts to get warm (I guess thats normal?)<br /> Bulky (heavier than most other digital cameras)<br /><br /> I used this camera to take pictures at the daycare at which I volunteer. My teacher explained to me how to use it in less than 1 minute. It's VERY easy to use and a lot of fun!! I even taught a 4 year old how to use this!!!! I suggest this camera to anyone.","For people who does not like to be bothered by continually changing films and having the pictures developed thru a processing center, this  camera - Sony MVC - FD75 is the camera for you.  All you have to do is shoot, shoot, shoot, and insert the memory stix to your PC and presto, you get you photos and print them.","I have been wandering the world for<br />6 years. Andy the HoboTraveler.com<br />I am on my second Mavica with 3.5 disk.<br />The reason is the 10 Optical Zoom and<br />the 3.5 disk. This is the perfect camera<br />for making webpages while traveling.<br />I can buy the disk in any underdeveloped<br />country and use in an internet cafe.<br />The 3.5 disk drive is a little fragile and<br />you should wait and not take photos too fast<br />or you will damage the floppy.<br />I have taken about 5000 photos with this camera.<br />I use this camera to post the page or links to<br />my travel newslette. ...","People who claim you don't get enough shots, or they are not good quality, are NOT good photographers, and do NOT have it set right!  You can get up to 32 shots on a single disk.  I am a professional, and took about 22 disks on a trip to Ireland.  Saved a lot of money developing!  Even using a very generic printer.  This camera is the best and I have a 75 and an 87 ~ just more bells and whistles.  A few more features, IF you use them.  The most user-friendly camera known to man.  Nothing NOT to love, here.","i highly recomend this product. i have been taking pictures for  10 years and this is the best camera so far.i just got married about 2 months ago and the pictures were taken with this camera.they turned out beautifully and the pictures were very clear and sharp.imaging was bright and the color was just perfect.there were no glares and no red eyes to fix.quality is graded 5 and is the best ive seen.","I sell on ebay and needed a good camera to take pictures of jewelry...without the shine and glare.  This did the trick.  Selling one Diamond ring payed for my camera!  I recommend.  Easy to use...directions easy to read.  May I even recommend buying it on ebay...:)","had one now for 1 1/2 years.use it mostly for close-up shots of toy trains for sale on internet ... worth every cent!!! very good at general use--outdoors the lcd display fades badly--found to be normal on most other digitals also--otherwise--NO complaints!!","This camera I feel after looking at just about all out there on the market, this is the best camera for the money, makes beautiful pictures not at a professional level, but for personal snapshots.<br />SWEET","I work in a primary school (with children aged 4 to 11) and we've had a Mavica now for 3 years and never looked back!<br />The school's first digital camera was a poor pathetic thing - it stored the images internally, so the camera couldn't be used until the images contained on it had been saved onto a computer (via fiddly wires and software) or until the pictures had been deleted. As a result - the camera sat in the cupboard unused.<br />THEN - we got the Mavica! Now, one class can take pictures with it, remove the disk then pass it to another class for immediate use. We found that a disk usually holds around 30 to 40 images, and although the print quality at this resolution is not *fantastic* it is still good enough for use on displays around school and is ideal for taking pictures for use on the school's website.<br />The camera is sturdy enough to be used by children, and easy enough for them to use unsupervised, and is still working well after many school trips and the occasional exposure to rain!<br />We haven't had any problems with the LCD screen becoming scratched - although it can get a bit dirty with fingerprints from time to time - but these can be wiped off with screen cleaner.<br />Battery life is good - it is easy to re-charge and charges up quickly.<br />There are no wires or cables and no software needs to be installed on your computer - just shove the disk in your A-drive and you're away. It HAS to be simple for the un-technically minded or it wouldn't get used - this camera rarely goes back into the cupboard it is used so much! In fact - we seemed to spend so long chasing round school searching for it that we invested in another Mavica this summer.<br />Its worth buying the soft carry case for this camera and we have found having a spare battery useful - but I reckon the average user could manage with just the one.<br />I can highly recommend this camera!","I put off buying a digital camera because of the cost and the photo storage. I often go out of the country, and I take LOTS of pictures. Having a memory stick is just not a convenient option, since you have to either go home and dump it when it's full, buy several of them, or take your laptop to dump them onto. With a floppy, however, I can buy extra disks in almost any country, I can LABEL them and use separate disks for each place I go (try that with a memory stick!), AND (most importantly), I have a PERMANENT COPY of the pictures on the floppies. If my computer crashes or picks up a nasty virus, I STILL HAVE MY PICTURES on my floppies, labeled, filed, and ready.<br />NOW, as for the camera... it is ridiculously simple to use, the zoom works great, the colors turn out vividly (and you can always \"fix\" things with a picture editor later!), the camera is rugged (I have taken quite a few pictures with it at 60mph in the front seat of a rollercoaster, and best of all is the angle of having everything on an easy-to-use disk. When we travel and stay with people, we can share our pictures with ANYONE who has a computer, not just those with memory stick readers. The camera even has disk copy and file copy functions built in... when I take pictures of a group, I can copy the pictures onto extra disks with the camera right then and there, and hand everyone their own picture disk. No need to collect email addresses and send them later!","Pros: A) NO USB, NO SW, Just a floppy disk,B) 10X ZOOM...WICH IS VERY USEFUL. C) HEAVY DUTY, We use it in a locomotive workshop for more than 2 years without any problem.<br />Cons: Low Quality pictures  (0,3 mp) ...but check if you really need more...I do not B) HEAVY BATTERIES.","I love this digital camera.  It takes awesome pictures and is so easy to use.  I had never used a digital camera before and this one is so easy.  It is real easy to carry and handle, too.  I highly recommend this camera.  I have been very pleased with it.  AAA+++","My boss had one of these four years ago, and every camera I have tried since then, just doesn't equal the ease this camera is to use. I finally bought my own and it is just like my boss's and it is so great. My husband borrowed it the other day for his job, and he loved it too. I told him, hey get your own Mavica (think he will). The price has come way down from four years ago ...It is so very nice to not have to hassle with only being able to download to computers with special software. You can take this to any computer and have your photos right now. I strongly recommend it. But don't loan it out. You might not get it back.PS When I was shopping for deals, Amazon had the best price for the money. I found other sites that had them cheaper, but buyer beware. I was told that many of these extra low sites are not legitimate Sony dealers and that if you order an extra cheap one, there is no warranty, and no promise that you will even receive a new camera. Be careful where you buy it. Amazon has never done me wrong. I knew they would treat me right this time and they sure did. For the others, they used to say on Hill Street Blues, Be careful out there.","been buying sonys since middle 1950s w/the transistor radio...<br />this 75 does all that an all around point and shooter...would<br />have loved an optical viewfinder so I could compose shots.<br />pointing at light actually prevents you from composing since<br />the lcd screen is diffiuclt to see.  the floppy screening is the best","this camera is for any beginner, it's so easy to use anyone can figure it out. Takes incredible close ups. I'm certainly not disapointed w/it.","I took this camera on a trip to NYC.  I chose to take the Sony because I was not going to be near my PC for a week, and could not \"download\" the images I captured.  I simply took along several floppy disks, and was all set.<br />One neat feature of this camera is that you can make copies of the disks.  If you are with friends or family, you can pass out copies to them right away!<br />I recommend this camera.","I have used this camera at work for three years now and I love it.  It is easy to use, easy to transfer images to your computer, and of great quality for the price.  I use the pictures for job related web sites that I maintain. I own a digital camera, which cost three times what the SONY MVC FD75 Mavica cost, and I am very dissatisfied with it (Using the camera and transferring images to the computer is always a problem and very time consuming). I highly recommend this product.","This is an excellent camera for it's price. You should definitely NOT purchase a digital camera cheaper than this. I've tried others that are valued [at less], and they are garbage. If you plan on using this camera for pictures only, it's the perfect camera for you. It's ideal for taking pictures to post on the internet as about 17-45 pictures fit on a single floppy disk, meaning that the images are between 30 to 60 kilobytes depending on the quality you set (the quality is great though). This is a perfect camera to use for sening pictures via e-mail and for posting pictures on E-bay. Also, since you save pictures on floppy disk, you can give the disks to friends and they can have the pictures without needing any complicated technology for getting the images on their computer. I'd recommend this camera 100%!","I bought this camera over three years ago and my partner also bought one. It has proved to be all that was promised.<br />Simple to use, giving great photos and with the option of a 60 sec.movie, it covers every situation.<br />Perhaps it's greatest factor for me is using floppy disks for memory. Always available, and in an emergency, they can be reused. Just a 3 1/2 floppy drive and no cables - what could be easier.<br />Like many of your other reviewers, I just love this camera and hope it lasts forever!","I LOVE my Mavica! This camera is all one will ever need at a price that is affordable in comparison with many others. It is simple to use, uses 3.5\" discs and creates great photos!  I could not be more pleased had I received a $12.00 camera as did my daughter (who still cannot figure out how to use it)  I highly recommend this camera.","This is the easiest camera that I've ever used. The pictures are clear and crisp. The zoom-in and zoom-out is effortless and you don't have to worry about rolls of film.  Everything about this camera is EASY!!  If I can use it, everyone can use it.  It' great.  The only thing you have to remember, don't hold the camera up to your eye.  Thank you, Jean Fling","Despite the low spec of the Mavica, it remains unbeaten for ease of use and convenience. I have introduced the camera to many people with no computer knowledge who previously shyed away from cables, wires etc.<br />Images are ideally suited for webwork and e mailing where file size is critical.","I really like this camera. It is great for emails and the like. The quality is great as well.<br />I noticed in the reviews that one person wrote a couple of reviews giving it one star. This person is trying to unfairly trying skew the data. In statistics this is called an outlier. Input of this nature would normally by discarded in a satistical analysis.","The MAVICA records it's images on an ordinary 3.5\" floppy -<br />just like is sold for computers ($.30, in packs of 10).<br />  It can even view the images taken without a PC! When you're ready to see them on your PC, or send them as e-mail attachments, just pop them into you A: drive and select the version with a .jpg image (the other one is used by the MAVICA,<br />so it can view the .jpg image without a computer).","I got the Sony MVC-FD75 as a gift for christmas and im so happy with it and the pics it takes. Its so easy to use and with a floppy disk you can e-mail pics much faster then with a camera with port cables you have to hook up to your PC .","I love the Mavica.  We've only filled two floppy disks with pictures ( about 78 pics) and every photo is fantastic!  It's easy to  use, plus floppy disks are WAY cheaper than the memory cards (they run about $50 and only store 6 pictures or so...but the floppys are dirt cheap and store anywhere from 20 hi-res photos to 40 low-res photos).  Worth the money.  Tons of great features!","Picture this, you are on a nice vacation somewhere and you have taken many pictures with your new digital camera.  You get back to your hotel or maybe a relative's house and want to load the pictures onto a PC to e-mail them to your friends and relatives.  How easy is that?  With the 'memory card'-based cameras, sure you can fit 100 high quality images in your camera, but then to get them off the camera and onto the PC, you need a hookup cable (and the proper port on the PC you plug into) PLUS the software CD included with your camera.  Even with those things, you have no guarantee it'll work to hookup to that particular PC.  Contrast, with diskettes as your media, you not only have universal compatibility with every PC on the planet, you also do not have a speicific limit to the number of pictures you can take (since you just keep feeding in diskettes as if they were 'film').  A diskette is also FAR cheaper than a memory card or even traditional film.<br />The other big selling factor which goes along with the compatibility issue is the ease of use.  The menus are intuitive and things aren't that much different mechanically than a standard camera.  You can learn as you go without paying any penalty really.  I'm totally sold on the diskette approach depite the fact that I can only fit maybe 15 'fine' quality images on one diskette.  I don't mind, because the virtually unlimited storage (limited only by the number of diskettes you have with you), is awesome.<br />What's not to like?  Because of the diskette drive which is embedded in the camera, it's bigger than many other digital cameras, making it tough to just slip in your pocket. On the flip side, it's not going to get lost easily either.  The image quality leaves a little to be desired, but most entry-level digital photographers won't be disappointed.  The image quality is more than adequate for e-mailing shots of the family to friends and relatives, and there are several settings which can help, namely \"fine\" quality setting, and \"bitmap\" format.  Those two, while bigger, produce good looking results.  For action shots or basic candid photos at evens, you can get 30 pictures with 'standard' quality JPEG settings.<br />For the price, up to half as much as many digital cameras out there now, this Sony camera is worth a look.  If you're not picky about the size, not hungup on megapixels, and looking for something very easy to use anywhere you go, this is the camera to get.","I have had my Sony Mavica MVC-FD73 for about 3 years digital cameras were just coming on the market at reasonable prices then. I Love it! (...) When I have traveled overseas I didn't have to worry about running out of disks. I could take all the pictures I wanted without worrying about docking to a computer to unload or free up space for more photos, or only taking specific pictures so you don't run out of room. The pictures all turned out great. I make Jewelry and have a web site. It takes great pictures for that also. I love taking pictures of the flowers in my gardens and they look like you could pick them right off of the screen.  I just wish they would include their own photo editing software for people who don't have a good photo editor.  I use a professional photo editor with mine. I doubt that there is any software that it would not work with since all photos are saved in the .jpg format.  I can pop a disk from the camera right into my computer and my online software pulls up the pictures right on screen and into emails.  My whole family can share every special event as soon as it happens. My Mom, Sister and Aunt have purchased Mavicas also and I have not heard anything but praise from them either.  It is a great gift to bring your family closer together.","We have used the Sony digital camera for business use for about 3 years.  It is dependable and has great pics.  We use it for product review, and the disk load is easy to use.  Stores adequate number of pics and computer ease was my reason for choice.  The camera has many features that are easy to use, also.  The how to use book is a bit difficult to understand but with a little thought, it is a great purchase for the price.  Try it you'll like it.","I purchased my FD75 for the birth of my second child as I have not captured too many images of my firstborn and I knew I just needed a gimick to get going.  Well, it worked!  I take pix almost every day of my family, friends and everyday objects.  Living in a different state than the rest of my family has been hard but now we all feel a lot closer sharing pix all the time (my parents have a FD75, too.)<br />As for prints, I have gotten good 4x6 prints from Ofoto.com and have been very pleased with the quality.  Only upon colse inspection do they look less than lovely.  As a dedicated scrapbooker I am really quite pleased with the quality.  I've even gotten some nice 5x7 Sepia toned prints.<br />I have only good things to say about this camera.  Disregard the  reviews of \"one star\" as it seems that these people did not do their research and wanted pro-quality prints from this little (low mega-pixel) wonder.<br />GREAT CAMERA!<br />ps This format works really well with my dinosaur of a computer... I don't have a UPC port and the floppy disk was a deciding factor for me.  Very nifty feature.","very hard to find. I have to shop [...] to find accessories for this camera. love the camera though.","I ought this camera for its ease and quick response to be able to be used with floppy disks. This seems like a universal medium so as to print and trade pictures with family and friends. My wife loves the point and click and the simplicity of use. For the money this provides a high value for us.","Well I just got this Cam. a few weeks ago and I love it. Talk about easy to use, I was able to pull it straight out of the box and get it going(I already had a charged battery from my camcorder)this thing is such a cinch to use. I have yet to find out what the picture quality is like when I print them out but thats not what this camera is really for, use this camera for great quality web pics, just make sure there is good lighting otherwise the pictures may be grainy and or pixalated. This camera may be a bit spendy for some but I feel its well worth the money. Allright now go get this camera!! You wont be sorry.","The people who gave this camera 1 star reviews for poor hardcopy print quality should be rating themselves a 1 star,  not the camera!<br />This camera is not built nor, has it ever been advertised as having enough pixel capacity to create great detailed hardcopy photos.  This camera,  because of its limited resolution is strictly meant for use to make quality jpeg pictures which can be quickly e-mailed or uploaded to a webpage.  If you want detailed, crisp hardcopy pictures you had better be looking at a 3.3 meg camera at a minimum and a very high quality color dpi printer as well and the cost of those two together will run you 2k!<br />This camera does EXACTLY what it is meant and advertised to do - provides superb jpeg quality pictures for web and email purposes.  You'll never get great hardcopy photo quality with a 2meg camera,  there is no such animal!<br />If you are strictly looking for a camera with incredible ease of use and simplicity to post pictures on the web without hassles, usb cables, downloading software BS...etc... then this is your camera.  If you are looking for great hardcopy photo quality pictures try something along the lines of the Sony MVC FD95 or better.<br />I strongly suspect the people who have written bad comments about this camera did not do their homework before buying it.  Had they done so,  they would have known that there is not a 2 meg camera on the market which produces true hardcopy photo quality pictures which even come close to 3.3 meg picture quality because there simply isn't enough pixel resolution available.  Blame yourself,  not the camera dummies.  :-)","Right out of the box we were taking pictures without even reading the directions!  Just point, shoot, put the floppy in your computer and browse the pictures.  AND, they are the perfect size for e-mail or posting on your web page.  We also took it to a friends house, took pictures all afternoon, and then left the floppy disk with our friends.  And floppy disks are cheap and easy to use!","If you are looking for a digital camera to use for professional purposes or for print work, start searching elsewhere. BUT, if you are in the market for a digital camera that will present you with excellent quality photos for use with email or posting onto Web sites, this camera is a dream.  It is very simple and straightfoward to operate which makes it great for beginners. The storage mechanism is a simple 3.5 inch dirt cheap floppy disque that holds between 20-30 default setting images.  I use this camera on an almost daily basis and as a professional Web designer I recommend this camera wholeheartedly for this kind of work. But remember, do not purchase this camera if you are planning to use it primarily for printing photos. You WILL be disappointed.","I recently purchased the MVC/FD75 Sony Mavica.It is easy to use and cheap on the cost per photo since you are using a floppy.I have been able to take excellent pictures with it.As with any technology there are some things you wish you had,such as a viewer for this camera.It is not too bulky when you consider a 35 mm SLR,it really is quite light.The various photo formats is a plus for this camera since you can produce sepia,negative,B&W and Solarized photos. For someone that just wants to take photos and not become a professional photographer this is the camera for you.It's strong point is ease of use.The price is most reasonable for the camera you are getting.If you shop around there is a variation in price from 299.00 to 489.00. So it will pay you to do a bit of research.Battery life is another plus you are able to shoot for about 2.0 plus.It will pay you to purchase an extra battery as a backup.Good luck and enjoy a new experience.","This is the digital camera par-excellence for any beginner. It is also the perfect camera for an experienced user whose needs are web-based. The Mavicas use floppies that are not only dirt cheap, but reuseable. The standard 1.44 floppy will hold about 24 (in default resolution) pics that can go from the camera to your PC without cables or cradles in just seconds. These images are more than adequate for emails or for posting to a website, though they will barely make for good 4\" x 6\" photos (the available higher res setting will allow for adequate 5\" x 7\" prints). The camera is sturdy (albeit a bit heavy), the optics & zoom are very good, the flash is better than average, and the battery life is acceptable. If you're considering a digital for non-professional work, this is a fine choice.","This is my first digital camera. It's terrific. I really like the fact that it uses floppy disks. Using default resolution I get 25-30 images per disk. No extra software, no cables, just put the disk in your floppy drive and use explore. Easy easy easy! And lets face it, if you forget to pack disks you can get them ANY where. The picture quality is good. The camera is very easy to use. If you are not a professional photographer, and just want to point and shoot vacation pics family stuff like most of us, you will NOT be disappointed by this camera. I like it.","This is my first venture into the world of digital cameras so I don't have any comparisons but I CAN tell you how easy it was to use this camera with minimal learning. I sell on the auctions and asked other sellers....the Mavica was the camera of choice for online selling.  This model has great zoom and the perfect quality for internet use (I was told that it wouldn't do very good quality home prints, for that you need a higher model). I found this camera VERY easy to use after just a quick browse through the manual and it was the first time I'd ever touched a digital. I love the fact that the images are stored to regular floppies, no climbing under my desk to hook into the back of the computer. The pictures are a nice quality and the snaps and the download was quick and easy.  Wonderful little digital at a GREAT PRICE, I wish I'd done this sooner!  A++ in my book!"]},{"name":"Sony Mavica FD-87","amazon_reviews":["Good ole Sony Mavica is in good working condition and has served me well.  Fast shipping.  This is all you need to post ads online.

(...)<br />Speaking of features, this Sony has more than enough to satisfy the typical user. It features three image size settings - with a maximum of 1216 x 912. It has two resolutions - standard and fine. I've found that the standard setting delivers crisp photos on screen and does not create such large digital files for sharing. About 8 to 9 shots per floppy at the medium image size setting. The standard setting coupled with the lowest quality resolution (640 x 480) allows you to squeeze almost 20 photos on each floppy. And yes - floppies have come way down in cost. You can pick up a pack of 50 floppies for about $12 on average - or about 25 cents each. Sure is cheaper than a roll of film...and of course there's NO developing costs.<br />So - if you're still with me - here's how to justify this purchase. Let's assume you take a roll of film per month. The film will cost you about $2 or so a roll. The developing will run anywhere from $5 to $10, depending on how many copies of each print you desire. And then there's the cost of gas - ouch - these days for the two trips to the developer. So the out of pocket cost for you is probably over $10 per roll. Throw in the cost of running to Kinkos to get some photos scanned to send to your family and friends...and you're looking at close to $15 combined.<br />$400 divided by $15 equals approximately 26 rolls of film - about two years of shots for the average user. That's your breakeven point - and then every shot after that is gravy. No additional costs. And the battery is rechargeable and gives you a full day of shooting if you are taking candid shots on vacation. Less if you decide to use the Sony mpeg motion picture capability built in that delivers a twenty second movie per floppy. And using the built in zoom (6x) will also drain the battery somewhat more quickly.<br />The quality of the final photo? Superb. To an untrained eye, it is virtually impossible onscreen to denote any degradation of detail versus a 35mm shot. And using one of the online photo services like Ofoto.com produced outstanding prints from this camera. And yes - it even offers a neat self timer so you too can get into the photo.<br />Okay, okay. You get the idea. Oh - one more thing. I took the equivalent of twenty rolls of film the first week I had this camera. More photos than I've ever taken in my life.

And then there's the cost of gas - ouch - these days for the two trips to the developer. So the out of pocket cost for you is probably over $10 per roll. Throw in the cost of running to Kinkos to get some photos scanned to send to your family and friends...and you're looking at close to $15 combined.<br />$400 divided by $15 equals approximately 26 rolls of film - about two years of shots for the average user. That's your breakeven point - and then every shot after that is gravy. No additional costs. And the battery is rechargeable and gives you a full day of shooting if you are taking candid shots on vacation. Less if you decide to use the Sony mpeg motion picture capability built in that delivers a twenty second movie per floppy. And using the built in zoom (6x) will also drain the battery somewhat more quickly.<br />The quality of the final photo? Superb. To an untrained eye, it is virtually impossible onscreen to denote any degradation of detail versus a 35mm shot. And using one of the online photo services like Ofoto.com produced outstanding prints from this camera. And yes - it even offers a neat self timer so you too can get into the photo.<br />Okay, okay. You get the idea. Oh - one more thing. I took the equivalent of twenty rolls of film the first week I had this camera. More photos than I've ever taken in my life. And they were crystal clear... they printed wonderfully...and the camera itself was so easy to use that anyone I handed it to could use it within ten seconds. In fact, every person who has taken photos with it - friends, strangers, even teenagers - have uttered basically the same thing when handing it back:<br />\"Your new camera is really cool.\"<br />One final time for emphasis. No ifs....and no buts. No hesitation before I type these words. This is the BEST electronics item I've ever owned.","I purchase for a school district and I only buy Mavicas.  The quality is very good for most school projects.  The floppy drive option is great because if you check a camera out to people, you do not want to use expensive memory sticks that can be lost.  Also, when a person turns the camera in, the next person is can take it immediately.  There is no time to bother with download.  One person keeps the disks, turns the camera in, and the next person can take it without a download hassle.  The nice thing about this model is that you have the choice between disks and a memory stick if you want the extra space for high quality and quantity.<br />There are two disadvantages to this camera over previous models.  It is very easy in holding the camera to hit one of the three buttons at the bottom of the back and accidentally change a setting which can distort a picture.  Students have done this.  Example, some kids took a snapshot after the camera had been set up for them but their fingers hit the program button in accidentally and changed the camera to the moon setting for slow shutter speed -- as in a night photo.  As a result their shots were blurred.  The other disadvantage is that you have to plug the camera into the wall to charge the battery.  The older models allowed you to operate the battery charger without plugging it into the camera.<br />One note.  Cameras in this price range cannot stop action.  Do not use this kind of camera for stop-action sports.  They do not emulate the shutter speed of a professional 35mm camera which uses film.  They are wonderful for low light and outperforma any film-based camera for low light shots that do not need to stop action.","THIS CAMERA TAKES GREAT PICTURES.  YOU HAVE THE EASE OF A FLOPPY DISK. YOU CAN PUT UP TO THIRTY PICTURES ON THIS DISK DEPENDING UPON THE FORMAT YOU USE.  ALSO, THE DISK ARE CHEAP, UNLIKE MEMORY STICKS. YOU HAVE NO COMPUTER CONNECTIONS TO W0RRY WITH. JUST INSERT THE FLOPPY DISK INTO YOUR COMPUTER AND YOUR PICTURES ARE READY TO BE TAKEN OFF WITH THE SOFTWARE SONY PROVIDES. IT ALSO COMES WITH A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY AND A POWER CORD. ...I AM GLAD I PURCHASED IT.","There may be more sophisticated cameras out there - but this one is awesome.  I love the fact you can use floppies.  I went to a friends house and took pics all night and left her the disc!  Could do that with a memory stick.  Love this camera.","This is my second Mavica. The first one was MVC-FD85, but everytime I wanted to use it, my son had it. He got that one for Christmas and I bought the FD87. Nothing could be easier to use. My Grandkids, 4 and 7, take great pictures with it. I like the floppy (no extra cords),the movie mode, and the battery lasts a long time. Sony products are a bit pricey, but well worth it.","I love the Mavicas for their good, durable design, their ruggedness and their absolute ease of use. Their strongest point is their ease of use & therefore their appropriateness for people who like simplicity and hate the steep learning curve associated with the less intuitive digitals on the mkt. The Mavs use cheap, readily available and reuseable PC floppy discs go from camera to computer with no cables or cradles to make for foolproof downloads and very inexpensive image storage. This itineration of the Mavica offers higher resolution than the 7x series, allowing for a full 1.3 megabyte image that will exceed anyones web-based needs (including the desire to take quality pics for emailing). It is not the camera for those who need enlargements greater than 5\" x 7\", but it handles these with aplomb. One note here is that the FD87 offers a less powerful zoom than the (cheaper) 7x series, though the 3x optical coupled with the less useful 2x digital is still fairly powerful. All in all, this camera will not disappoint anyone."]},{"name":"Sony Mavica FD-92","amazon_reviews":["Replaced the one that I owned that fell in the water.

It's my first digital camera, and I must say that I am extremely satisfied with its features and performance. I even purchased the long life battery to go with it. I find it's battery life indicator to be helpful. The photo quality is exceptional depending on the resoloution level you set it at. The use of floppy disk or memory stick gives you even more options. It also has an indicator for the amount of room left on the disk for more pictures. I highly recommend this camera.","I bought the FD92 to replace a very early digital Epson that I had been using for a couple of years. My decision to purchase this specific Mavica was influenced by the fact that it could use both the floppy disc as well as a memory stick, a feature I had been waiting for. Almost all of my photos are published on the web so it was perfect for quick uploads from both my company Sony laptop as well as my small travel laptop or the desktop I have at home. With the addition of a wide conversion lens I found pics taken at trade shows and indoor exhibits with good artificial lighting were really good bordering on excellent. Battery life is excellent. I bought a spare and didn't really need it. Plus, I could get 30 Internet quality (640x480) shots on a 3x5 floppy disc.  All in all I was quite happy with my FD92 until 3 months and 2 weeks after my purchase the lens stopped focusing correctly while I was using it during an event weekend. Hey, I paid a premium because it's a great brand name right? So I sent it back to Sony at which point my happy experience ended. Seems the warranty is 90 days parts and labor and parts only after that. Seems typical, right? Problem is Sony's policy is that the minimum labor charge is $149. No parts will be provided unless you pay the $149 minimum labor charge, and the cost could be higher if more than 2 hours labor is needed to repair the camera. So, no matter what's wrong with the camera it's a minimum bill of $149 and this from a camera in use under 120 days with a manufacturers defect. At this point while I like the camera, I don't think I would do business with Sony again because the high price simply isn't paired up with support worth paying that premium for.","SI NECESITAS UNA CAMARA DIGITAL...ESTA ES TU MEJOR OPCION, POR SU GRAN CALIDAD DE IMAGEN Y PRINCIPALMENTE, POR LA FACILIDAD DE GRABACION, YA QUE LAS DEMAS NECESITAN MEMORY CARD Y SU PRECIO ES UN POCO ELEVADO Y CON LAS MAVICA CON SOLO UN DISKETTE DE 31/2 TIENES LO SUFICIENTE PARA TU CAMARA.","I bought this camera and it is great!  I waited for this model to come out since it offers dual media whereas you can write pictures to a floppy or memory stick (which I highly reccomend you get).  The floppy is great for quickly emailing picutres by simply making it an attachment from your A drive.  The great thing about the memory stick is you can take tons of picutres without having to swtich diskettes.  I have 2 32mb modules and I know at last count, I was able to get 45 picutres and still had room.  The zoom is another great feature. It has a 16x digital which is almost as good as my binoculars.<br />Get this camera...it is so user friendly and highly flexible.","This Mavica is the best of both worlds.  Storage to floppies or to a memory stick.  It has an impressive 8x optical / 16x digital zoom and macro capacity to 1.2 inches.  The resolution is tops and color rendition is great.  Battery life is also extrodinary and it accurately displays the time left for the battery on the LCD screen.  And the LCD screen is much larger that most of the other cameras on the market; 2.5\".  Top shutter speed is 1/500 second.  I shopped around a lot and tried the cameras my friends had.  I think this one is the best.","This itineration of the Mavica line offers their traditional sturdy feel, quality optics, and the media versatility of being able to use floppies or sticks {and no stick adapter needed}. The 92 has a great 8x optical zoom and offers pretty good 1.6 megapixel resolution. All the Mavs have demonstrated great color fidelity and this one is no exception. Lastly, it brings pretty good MPEG stats to the deal, able to record a video quite nicely on whichever media you have in place. NOW THEN, why the waning Mavica enthusiasm you might ask? SIMPLE: we are only a few *WEEKS* away from the release of a new breed of Mavicas,  making 1000s of shots on a single disc or even 90 minutes of movies on the same disc possible. That will take these Mavicas-CD to a whole new level of freedom & versatility. And the really good news: the prices are comparable to the old Mavica-FDs. If you're anything like me, you just have to love this kind of development.","I just got this camera.  In doing my research I found that this is a very similar camera to the MVC-FD90 camera.  This one is the 2001 model while the other is the 2000 model.  There are some differences, which I'll mention, but in general, I think this is a great camera for the price.<br />The reason I got this camera is because I needed the versatility of a digital camera with a removable medium (the disks) because over a long vacation memory sticks will fill up, and unless you have either a laptop to download your pictures to, or a lot of extra money lying around to purchase large mega byte memory sticks, this is the way to go.<br />The nice thing about this camera is that is will use either disks or a memory stick.  You don't have to buy the memory stick adaptor like with the other Mavicas, it's built into the camera - so you have the best of both worlds.<br />This camera will shoot up to 1.6 mega pixels.  This is ample for what I use the camera for, which is e-mailing, looking at the pictures on the computer, or printing out 5 X 7 pictures for a scrapbook.  Yes, the more mega pixels the larger the picture you can print with no distortion, but you will also pay more for the camera and then have to buy a larger memory stick as most stick cameras come with only an 8 meg card, which starts to add up.<br />The FD92 does the movies and that is extremely cool.  I use it all the time and I cannot express how neat it is.  It will shoot 15 - 60 second movies depending on the quality you want.  These are perfect for e-mailing.  It's like having a moving memory to look at without having to watch hours of wasted videotape.  If you've watched someone else's home movies, you know what I mean.<br />The big difference I know of between this camera and the FD-90 is that the FD-90 has a manual focus function where this one does not.  I don't consider it a loss.  The manual focus really is only useful when shooting for a very specific effect in a shot.  If you're looking for that much ability in a camera, you're probably already considering a professional level camera, which, again, is much costlier.  The FD-90 is also more expensive than this camera.  So, for less money you're getting a newer camera with this year's technology minus a feature will probably never use.<br />All I can say is that, like many Mavica owners before me, I love this camera.  It allows me to do everything I want to do, and it wasn't a killer in cost.  If you're considering the the FD-90, I'd recommend this one instead."]},{"name":"Sony Mavica FD-97","amazon_reviews":["Arrived quickly and looks and works like new.

Features I especially like:<br />  Optical 10X zoom. This optical zoom covers any situation I have encountered, from getting-up-close to the action while staying behind the fire lines, to getting close to a facial shot without distortion or intimidating the subject.<br />  High resolution images. When coupled with a good printer, the resolution of the images shot at the highest available count renders a print that looks continuous-tone, even under a jeweler's loupe.<br />  Ease of operation: Basic operations enabling great pix are quick to master. Advanced options aren't necessary to utilize in order to get the picture desired, but they are there, and I have yet to discover their full potential.","I bought this camera as a replacement for an FD91. I loved eveything about the FD91 except the need to carry a bunch of floppies around with me.<br />This camera solves that with the memory stick option, yet still let's you use floppies for when you want to take a quick couple of shots and hand the pictures off to someone else.<br />The only problem I have with it is that it uses a focus and exposure lock when the shutter release is pressed halfway. This doesn't work when you are following a moving object. By the time the camera is ready to fire the object has moved and is no longer in focus. I read the manual thoroughly and found no way to override this feature other than shifting to manual focus. The FD91 had a continuous focus system so this problem never occurred.<br />If you don't shoot a lot of fast moving objects, this camera is superb. If you do, you will be dissatisfied.","Wow! This camera is so easy to master. Just follow the instructions. It takes the most amazing pictures. It's a little slow processing using floppys, and if you use high resolution settings, you only get 2 to 4 pics per floppy. If you're not interested in real high resolution pics, you can get 20 to 30 pics per floppy. Memory sticks are the way to go. They process quickly, and depending the size of the sticks used, you can get hundreds of high resolution pics per stick. Buy the Lexar Memory Sticks. They're a great product at a great price. Film will soon be a thing of the past. I highly recommend the FD97, and Lexar memory sticks. You won't be sorry.","Wow! This camera is so easy to master. Just follow the instructions.

It is wonderful for stills, but misses a lot of otherwise good pictures of my grandchildren!","After having shot at least 1000 pictures with my Mavica FD97, I have yet to find the downside. Features I especially like:<br />  Optical 10X zoom. This optical zoom covers any situation I have encountered, from getting-up-close to the action while staying behind the fire lines, to getting close to a facial shot without distortion or intimidating the subject.<br />  High resolution images. When coupled with a good printer, the resolution of the images shot at the highest available count renders a print that looks continuous-tone, even under a jeweler's loupe.<br />  Ease of operation: Basic operations enabling great pix are quick to master. Advanced options aren't necessary to utilize in order to get the picture desired, but they are there, and I have yet to discover their full potential.","I bought this camera as a replacement for an FD91. I loved eveything about the FD91 except the need to carry a bunch of floppies around with me.<br />This camera solves that with the memory stick option, yet still let's you use floppies for when you want to take a quick couple of shots and hand the pictures off to someone else.<br />The only problem I have with it is that it uses a focus and exposure lock when the shutter release is pressed halfway. This doesn't work when you are following a moving object. By the time the camera is ready to fire the object has moved and is no longer in focus. I read the manual thoroughly and found no way to override this feature other than shifting to manual focus. The FD91 had a continuous focus system so this problem never occurred.<br />If you don't shoot a lot of fast moving objects, this camera is superb. If you do, you will be dissatisfied.","Wow! This camera is so easy to master. Just follow the instructions. It takes the most amazing pictures. It's a little slow processing using floppys, and if you use high resolution settings, you only get 2 to 4 pics per floppy. If you're not interested in real high resolution pics, you can get 20 to 30 pics per floppy. Memory sticks are the way to go. They process quickly, and depending the size of the sticks used, you can get hundreds of high resolution pics per stick. Buy the Lexar Memory Sticks. They're a great product at a great price. Film will soon be a thing of the past. I highly recommend the FD97, and Lexar memory sticks. You won't be sorry.","Wow! This camera is so easy to master. Just follow the instructions.

It's not the best for either, but it is the best for both.  The reason is the floppy drive. I can take pictures for others, and hand them the floppy.  For personal use, you need to purchase an additional memory stick, otherwise you will be swapping floppys after every third or fourth high res picture.  The controls, and the view screen are very good.  The camera takes excellent pictures.  I also love the 15 secon video clips.  This a new option for me, and I love it.  I am slightly annoyed with the cycle time to take a second picture.  If you need a camera that can use floppy's, look no further.  If floppy's are not needed, keep looking."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P30","amazon_reviews":["Love It!","I bought this camera at a military exchange for pretty cheap.  For my first Digital Camera I made a fine choice.  You can never go wrong with Song first off.  The camera is pretty basic, I didn't even read the instructions before using.  It takes great photos and is pretty durable.  Being in the military, I've taken this thing around the world and have had no ill effects.  The only problem I can think of is that the delay is pretty long.  This camera is no good for quick pictures, but I've worked around it.  I also would recommend a memory stick upgrade.  The one that comes with it only holds about 10 pictures.  That's ok at home but over seas you have to have more memory.  For a first time digital camera buyer, I most diffently recommend this camera.","I've had this camera for almost two years now; have taken tons of pics both for the internet and for print. Using the best resolution it offers in normal light conditions, I've had perfect quality prints developed. You can't tell that they were taken with a digital camera - at least I can't and that's enough for me. :) Some minor problems do occur, though: if there's not enough light (for instance indoors) without the flash the picture becomes grainy. Also, it takes some time till it clicks. And a lot of pics were blurry when i used it in a party with a lot of flashing coloured lights around - but I guess that's not everyday use. :)<br />As for the battery: I was surprised to read about these problems. I have inexpensive rechargable batteries and they last for a reasonably long period of time. I've never had a problem with them.<br />I really like this camera, with the optical zoom and other features. Once you get used to the longer time it takes to click and if taking party-pics is not your main goal, it's a very good camera.","In the world of electronics, you really cannot go wrong with Sony.  I use this camera for work and travel, and it never dissapoints.  Light, but clear, it will go with you and take great sharp pictures with ease.  The nice thing about this, and other digital cameras, is you can pick what pictures you want to print and which ones to throw away.  Easy to share pictures with family online, and keep on your computer for easy storage.  I would recommend this camera for novices-experts.","This was my first attempt at buying a digital camera and i've been quite happy with the picture quality of this Sony.  A few quibbles I have are the fact that Sony addons (like additional memory cards and card readers) are Sony-specific and are thus very expensive in comparison to less exclusive brands.  I would expect to buy about $50-100 in addons while buying the camera.  The angle that one holds the camera is a bit awkward as well.  Instead of putting it in the cradle of your palms, one puts it in the cradle of your index finger and thumb in somewhat of a L fashion on both sides.  Theres a long lapse between clicking the shoot button to actually taking the shot when the camera is set in autofocus making it somewhat hard to capture split second events or motion although one could always turn this autofocus feature off.<br />On  the plus side, I was pleasantly surprised that the camera doesnt seems to eat up battery time as much as I expected.  I'm slightly disappointed with the zoom of the camera in that its a bit lacking but this may be a problem with all 3X digital zoom cameras.  I would definitely have to say that the camera is not the best for its money if you consider the addons (when compared to the A10) but it gives quite good pictures none-the-less which is, after all, the whole point; hence I gave it 4 stars.","The Sony DSC-P30 is a terrific first camera to use for great 4\"x6\" snapshots or good 5x7s, or for email or web use.  (You would need more pixels to do bigger enlargements).  It takes great pictures; is very well-featured for a camera in this range; and is well-designed and easy to use.<br />- The 3x optical zoom is a huge plus, and will give you much better composed and better quality photos than non-zoom or digital zoom cameras.<br />- If you like close-ups, the \"Macro\" feature will amaze you.<br />- It's all automatic when you want to point and shoot, but allows you some control when you want it.<br />The features and components are based on more expensive Sonys, a big plus.<br /> ...P>A few things to know up front:<br />- All digital cameras eat batteries.  Get NiMH rechargeables rated 1700-1800 mah (cheaper and better than the Sony lithium pack for this camera).  The DSC-P30 is actually better than most in that it uses only 2AAs, and lasts a fairly long time on that.  So you can easily carry a spare set, shoot all day, and your battery worries are over.<br />- The Sony Memory Stick format IS more expensive, but since this is a lower-resolution 1.3MP camera you need only 64 to 128mb (gives you 100-200 photos at high quality).  Unfortunate, but not enough difference to avoid this camera, as some suggest.<br />- All digital cameras have \"shutter lag\" and longish shot to shot times.  This is one of the major adjustments new digicam owners face when they get their first camera.  The Sony DSC-P30 starts up very fast, and has a typical shot-to-shot time.<br />- All digital cameras have trouble in low light.  The \"autofocus illuminator\" on this camera helps with that, and is rare on lower-priced cameras.<br />- The viewfinder (used in bright light or to save battery by not using LCD) doesn't show the full picture.  It's a common problem, you can somewhat get used to it, but it's one of the few negatives for this camera.<br />An alternative would be the Canon A10.  Less features, a little heavier (uses 4AAs), but the Compact Flash cards Canon uses are cheaper.  Both cameras require you to buy rechargeable batteries and a bigger memory card to be really usable - that's industry practice, unfortunately.","I did a ton of research before buying this camera and concluded that it had the best set of features for the price.  After purchasing it I am quite sure my research paid off.  The pictures are crystal clear, and although only 1.3 MegaPixels, that is more than enough for me.  High points are:<br />-3x OPTICAL zoom (you almost NEVER find this feature in any camera [in this price range])<br />-excellent auto-focus (not focus-free like many in this price range) and flash pictures<br />-Crisp backlit LCD viewfinder<br />-PRICE!!!<br />The only caveats are that sony's accessories are a bit more expensive than the competition, but you can get around that by using lexar or sandisk brand memory sticks (which work perfectly), and using NiMH 1600MaH+ batteries.

Not being a camera guy this was my first camera I ever bought. I wasn't too excited about it but my girlfriend was.  Turned out the camera was fun and really useful.<br />We bought the Sony rechargable batteries after realizing the regular ones last about 10 minutes. The new batteries last about an hour and a half, which makes them a good bargain. The memory card it comes with is not very useful, but I reccommend atleast 32MB.<br />The digital camera is fun, especially for an electronics junky like me. I recommend this camera highly. The picture quality is outstanding in my opinion, being a novice the pictures are clear and that is good enough for me. We have a portable sony printer and the images we have printed are amazing.","Ok, we have beat the battery issue to death. If you get 4 Ni-MH batteries and a charger you will be just fine. You don't need the ac adapter. I found the best thing to do is just download the file folder on the memory stick in the camera into your computer. (it takes a short time) Then, look or work on your photos from there. I would also recommend a 32 meg memory stick. they are $30 dollars or so and hold a lot of photos. Even with the batteries, charger and additional memory stick....you are under [item price] for a really nice camera. This size is perfect too. Easy to put in a pocket or carry in your fanny pack. Oh, one additional bonus I found from using recharge Ni-MH's. Just as it will do with the sony recharge pack, when the Ni-MH's are getting low, the power light starts to blink. No guessing if the batteries are low!","Good camera, with lots of features, EXCEPT battery life. Tried alkaline AA batteries and got about 10 minutes on the first set. Finally turned off LCD and flash and got more time, but no AC adapter means using the batteries to transfer pics to the PC. I got tired of this, returned the camera, and bought the DSC-P31, which has 2.1 Megapixel AND has the NMH batteries with recharge. Only has 3X digital zoom, but otherwise it is similar to the P30. Also comes with 8MB memory stick instead of 4.","I love this camera! For my purposes, it has proven to be the perfect choice - easy to use, easy to tote around! Everyone I send pictures to, comments on the color and picture quality, and asks what kind of camera did I purchase? I'm having much fun and it has ignited my interest in photography all over again!<br />This is my first digital camera, and so I cannot comment on it in comparison to what else is on the market.<br />It was a bit disappointing to find that the batteries drained SO QUICKLY, but I've since purchased some rechargeables made just for digital cameras, and also a larger memory stick. Both were too skimpy, and forking out more money was also a bit disappointing, as I thought I'd found such a wonderful deal on the camera itself, but the extra's I've chosen to get are proven good investments over the past two weeks of having the camera.<br />Overall, I would recommend this little camera to anyone!","The camera is small, neat, spiffy and works well. Easy to use.  Only problem so far it eats batteries like nobodies business. the first pack lasted all of six pictures.  Mind you I was playing around with the LCD but man.  Next pack was almost just as bad - perhaps a dozen pics.  I have gone through about 4 sets of batteries quick.  Ran a test to see how many shots I could get on fresh batteries.  Got 55 with the LCD on and flash by taking shot after shot.  Got 185 with flash on but no LCD, again just taking shot after shot.  Looks like the batteries must be draining if left in the unit 'cause I can't see why the first few sets got only a few pics.....anyhow I ordered the Ion battery....we'll see...","Oh, man!  As soon as I opened the box and read the manual, I found that I needed to go shopping for a new AC adaptor (list price $50) and bigger memory stick (probably $60).  If the camera can't upload pictures without the AC adaptor, one should be included with the camera!  Who takes pictures and never uploads?<br />Other than the skimpy capacity of the included memory stick and the missing AC adaptor, a pretty spiffy little camera.","Very nice camera with loads of features. To truely enjoy it though, purchase a rechargable battery pack.","This is a great camera, The picture quality is above my expecations for 1.3mp, It is packed with tons of features (Black & White, and other special effects, lets me manually adjust settings), I feel like a pro with this camera, the lens gets noticed, it looks like the ones the pros are using. Batteries arent a nightmare if you have atleast 4 Rechargable NiMh Batteries on hand, I would also recommend getting atleast a 32mb memory stick, it will hold about 50 pictures in the highest resolution, also get a case to protect your investment. The movie mode is cool, although I havent had a chance to really use it very much. Use Twilight Mode only with a tripod because even a little shake from your hands will cause it to be blurry in Twilight Mode. You will like this camera.","If you read any of the reviews, especially the negative ones, MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS! I want to shed light on the most of the negative comments here that are really inexperienced users being unprepared.<br />I have used an Olympus D-340L for a couple years now. I have taken innumerable shots from close-up portraits to multishot panoramas and most things in between, like action shots. Which, by the way, most digital cameras under a grand do not do well without practice. Even then it's a compromise. So I suppose that is the first truth.<br />Second is battery life. No AA batteries will last long in ANY product with an LCD display. Especially when there is also a flash and electronic components that can really drain. The solution, as recommended by some here is rechargables.  Recharagbles often make sense for home-centered products. If you plan to hit the road, bring a set of Alkalines for emergencies. Your other option, like many 35mm film cameras, is non-rechargable lithiums. I use this method and have found it is economical.<br />Truth three is AC adapters. So far as I have seen, all digital cameras require a proprietary AC power adapter that is thirty to sixty extra dollars. It's a plain fact, unfortunate but true. Two months after the camera I got the adapter and since then ALWAYS use it during the slow (serial, not USB, boohoo) camera to PC transfer.<br />Truth four is memory/photo storage. Here's the deal: you get what you pay for. Two years ago, my 340L was rated number one by Consumer Reports, came with a 4MB SmartMedia card, and was about four hundred dollars. That was a good value for an relatively exceptional \"basic\" digital camera at the time. The P30 would be a better value with 8MB. But it has features that others do not at this price.  So this camera's compromise is less included storage. However, you can get a wide angle lens for about fifty bucks, where others are over a hundred, if at all.<br />So, THE TRUTH IS: You are paying comparitively less, but also getting the mentioned compromises, all of which can be overcome. Albeit with a little, and sometimes not, dinero.<br />So there it is. I hope it helps you.<br />Happy Shooting!","i originally wanted to get the sony dsc-p50, but it is incredibly hard to get.  i do not live in the united states, nor do i have a credit card, so i couldn't buy it online.<br />luckily, my dad owns a computer shop, so he was able to get the p30 for me, as well as a 32MB memory stick.<br />i love this camera.  in the four years that i have been interested in photography, i've owned two digital cameras - this is my third.  the other two were AGFA cameras, and did not boast any megapixels.  one had a 2X optical zoom and the other, no zoom at all.  they were good cameras, but this one far surpasses them both.<br />the quality of the LCD is amazing, and the quality of the photographs is even better.  i love that there is a macro feature and i especially love that i can take black and white pictures, sepia pictures, etc...  i also love the zoom.  so convenient and so wonderful!<br />of course, as many reviews state, this camera does like batteries a lot, but i was prepared for this:  i already had three pairs of nickel-metal-hydrate batteries, which pretty much takes care of that problem, except if, like me, you enjoy using the LCD screen (but then again, i haven't had this camera for a week yet, so i want to try it out and play!).<br />quite a few reviewers (for the p30 & the p50) have also stated that the manual says you *must* use an AC adapter to upload pictures to your computer.  this is false.  the manual clearly states that it is recommended that an AC adapter be used, but not mandatory.  it also clearly states that if batteries are used, to make sure there is enough power in them, otherwise files on the memory stick may be damaged or lost.<br />i am thoroughly pleased with this camera.  an example:  i took a macro & zoom shot of some violets that we have at work.  when i uploaded the pictures to my computer and resized them, i noticed that the camera had even picked up a piece of dust on one of the petals of the flower.  how's that for picking up detail?<br />i don't feel this is a beginner's camera at all.  the features on it are too advanced.  i am by no means an advanced photographer, but i'm no amateur either.  i will enjoy this camera for years to come, i'm sure.<br />although the accessories are - as noted by several other reviewers - rather skimpy, the camera is worth it.  i definitely recomment it for anyone who's willing to buy some good batteries and a better memory stick.  ...<br />fantastic camera for the price! =)","I received the camera for Christmas and it did not take long  to begin to operate it.  I took the memory stick out and put it, turned it on, and I began taking pictures right away.  The little screen showed exactly what the picture that was taken. When I got home and put them on my computer, the pictures looked even better.  The software that came with the camera was easy to use and understand.  I reccomend this camera for anyone who is looking to buy a digital camera  to replace their 35mm camera.","This is a great camera.  The pictures are good and the 4MB memory stick that it comes with will hold 58 pictures if you use the standard mode instead of fine. (I honestly can't tell the difference between them unless you zoom in a bunch.) The MPEG feature is cool, no sound though.  The drivers were easy to load and when you turn on the camera and hook up the USB cable it treats it like another hard drive.  You just click on My Computer and there it is!  Pretty simple.  The only draw back is battery life.  I have since purchased the Sony Litium rechargeable battery but have not got it yet so I don't know if it will make a big difference.  Using regular AA batteries though, it maybe lasts 10 minutes maximum, pretty pathetic, but I guess most digicams with LCD screens are like that.  Hopefully, the Sony battery will help.","We bought this camera a few months ago.  This was our first digital camera and we wanted mainly to take photos for viewing on the computer, posting on webpages and emailing to family.  We have not yet tried to print photos taken with this camera as we don't yet own a printer for doing that.<br /><br />We have been very pleased with the picture quality - I don't think it could be any better.  The camera is also easy to use.<br /><br />We bought a bigger memory stick to take with us on vacation as the one supplied doesn't hold enough photos for a one week vacation.  Also, we recommend buying the 4 pack NiMh Kodak AA rechargeable battery unit.  Taking pictures doesn't drain the battery but uploading them for any length of time to your computer will drain them in a matter of minutes.  Get the battery pack mentioned above and you will always have a spare pair ready to go when you need them.  It's a must.<br /><br />One complaint we read about this camera is the length of time it takes the camera to get ready between shots.  I do notice a delay that is sometimes frustrating if you are trying to take several pictures quickly in a row.  If you take action photos this is probably not a good choice.  However, overall we are very pleased with this camera.  If your main goals are sharp quality photos for computer/online viewing you can't go wrong.","The DSC-P30 is a great beginner digital camera (...). The pictures turned out great. The optical zoom works well. Ignore the digital zoom as it pixelises the snap. The LCD is pretty crisp and clear. The menu is also very intuitive. Its got a host of other attractive features.<br />On the darker side, the accessories included are no great guns. Only a (...) 4MB memory stick is included. Even the battery is optional. So you have to spend (...) more for battery, AC adapter and an additional 64MB memory stick.","If you want a camera for sending pictures over the Internet or for small photos, then the Sony DSC-P30 camera is a great entry level camera. Even though it's 1.3 megapixels, this camera has a lot features not available on other 1.3 megapixels such as 6X zoom and mpeg movie (no audio). The best feature I like is the macro setting as it lets you take pictures up close of very small objects. Since, I publish trout flies over the internet, I have got comments about the great picture quality.<br />The only downside to the camera is battery comsumption. I would recommend buying batteries specially designed for digital cameras. When I go fishing I often bring a spare pair of batteries and over a day I can run out of power. The best way to solve that problem is turn off the viewfinder.","First off, yes it would be wise to buy a lithium (sp?) battery and charger.  It DOES go through the AA batt. very quickly (20min or so).  But there are so many pluses to this camera especially for a starter camera.  In simple terms it has: picture effects (black/white,sepia,solarization,negative), hooks up to the tv for easy viewing, USB cable, MOVIE mode (w/out sound),10sec timer.  I really have enjoyed this camera so far and it really is easy to use.  The instructions are a bit overwhelming but you get the hang of it rather quickly.  It makes great 4x6 prints as well.  We bought our camera with a free 32mb of memory so make sure you shop around.  The camera comes with a picture program that is really easy to use.  It takes awhile to familiarize yourself with the program but you can resize, crop, add funny \"props\" and just have fun with your pictures.  I reccomend this camera to anyone that wants a good camera for a great price.","Awesome!! Its price and features are hardly to find in such a sleek camera. The quality of the pictures is good enough in almost every situation, so if you are not a professional you'll be amazed of what can be done with 1.3 Megapixels. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is beacuse of his \"STAMINA\" power supply, they are not included!!, and if you buy it (almos a MUST HAVE!) you have to buy the charger too. But still it is a great buy!","I bought the Sony P30 and I realy enjoy it, but don't think the [initial cost is] everything you have to pay. I bought me the Starterkit because you really need a better batterie for that camera because the batteries they ship doesn't work really long.<br />But if you choose to buy this camera , I think you really will enjoy it too!!","When I went out to buy a digital camera, the only one that I found within my budget that was built as good as the expensive ones was the P30. It had all the features I was looking for, so I bought it. When I took the memory stick into town to have the pictures made into prints, everyone told me that they couldn't develop prints from the Sony Memory Sticks. So, there I was with a camera that I loved, but couldn't use because no one developed prints from the Memory Stick. The moral of the story is, only buy cameras that use the Lexmar style cards.","The Sony DSC-P30 is very a user friendly digital camera. It takes excellent clear pictures, with the ability of having different formats of pictures. And with the memory stick, you have the ability to save as many pics and video to suit your needs. Overall, performance and ease of use is 5 stars. Although, I do wish Sony included a charger and re-chargeable battery. But, other than that, it's a fun digital camera to have.","I spent a great deal of time researching and trying out several digital cameras before buying.  I had a limited budget of $300-400, so I wanted to get as much quality as I could for as few $$$ as possible.  Doesn't everyone?<br />I tried out the Canon Powershot A20, Olympus, and Fuji FinePix.  All came highly-recommended and rated by consumer reports. But I saw that the Sony Cybershot also ranked in the top 5 in one report so I check it out.<br />I was extremely impressed with the features and quality of photos taken with the Cybershot.  The price was one of the lowest too. I highly recommend trying out the cameras before you buy!  Don't just take an editor's word for it.  Picking out the right digital camera with the right look and feel is a very personal thing.<br />The only bad thing that I can say about the Cybershot is that despite being around $100 cheaper than comparable products, you'd be well advised to take that $100 and buy Sony's lithium-ion battery and charger kit.  Alkalines last only minutes in this camera but the Stamina (Sony's Lithium-Ion battery) lasts an outstanding 90 minutes!!<br />The camera comes with features like an MPEG movie mode for capturing short video clips (no sound), photo effects like Sephia, and photo editting (zooming, cropping, resizing) right on the camera.<br />Another feature that I liked with the Cybershot was the freedom to take control over the shutter speed and aperature if I wanted to try some advanced photo effects.<br />Try before you buy!  You'll be glad that you did.","Most of the customer reviews so far have expounded on two key facts: 1) This camera has very good functionality for the price, and 2) Sony did a poor job with power supply. It comes with alkaline batteries, which the manual says you can't use to transfer files to a computer. It's hard to call the power adapter and a battery upgrade (e.g. nickel metal hydride) anything but a necessity.<br />Left out of the reviews is a third factor which people haven't seemed to mention yet. The cameras, or perhaps just some of them, don't function properly with FRESH AA alkaline batteries. After mine quickly used up the two that came with it, I put in good fresh ones that tested well, and the camera wouldn't turn on in either record mode or moving picture mode (and would turn off if I moved into those modes from others). In playback mode, the battery indicator verified that the batteries were good. This led to emails to Sony which led to inane computer-generated responses reminding me to change the batteries. Eventually I got through to a representative on the phone who said the problem I was having was common. Got that - MANY people had the same problem. Best Buy doesn't accept the returns because Sony, wary of the problem, includes a label in the packaging saying something like \"if malfunctioning do not return to the store.\" They don't offer you your money back as part of your warranty. Now I'm stuck having to ship it to PA and hoping they return it working properly. Meanwhile I've bought Nickel MH batteries and a charger which has seemed to be a quick fix. I've sent pictures to the computer without the AC adapter that Sony indicates is mandatory.<br />I've edited this review to add that I now believe I've purchased enough equipment to get around the power supply problem.  NiMH batteries, a charger, a 32 MB memory stick, and a USB memory stick reader all appear to make the camera fully functional.  It takes good pictures.  Still, [those dollars are] a lot to throw at a $... camera, and Sony's skeletal warranty and lack of forthrightness are troublesome.","The pictures are great, the ease of use is great. The LCD is exceptional, as is the quality of the twilight picutres. Why do I mark it down? It came with only a couple of AA bateries and they were *gone* in one session. You do not know until you have it that you need to purchase an additional charger/adapter in order to upload to your computer. (They instructions clearly say NOT to do it with only batteries, but there is no transformer included.) Also no carrying case. Sony appears to be going for an \"aftermarket\" here. I would not recommend this to anyone without these caveats.<br />Just adding a bit. 1. I did not experience the problems that they guy did when putting in fresh batteries. I already had niMH's and a charger, but went ahead and paid ... for Sony's \"power package\". 2. The lithium batteries make a world of difference. Still I resent the fact that the transformer is something you need and Sony didn't include it. The real price ... Not a bargain. (Includes Sony's ... discount for registering - be sure to use a seldom used web address - they really hit you with ads.)","this was our first digital camera and we are not disappointed.  it is an excellent camera, easy to use and produces great quality photos.  we did quite a bit of research and we made our decision based on the following:<br />- we were novices so we didn't want to go high end at first - we have a sony camcorder so we had memory sticks available - we read some of the other reviews about battery life so we bought the power adapter and rechargable batteries<br />even though the camera is a 1.3 megapixel, we are very happy with the results it produces.  the picture is definitely clear and we can confidently use these photos on our business web site. with the research we did, we are very happy with this product.","I did plenty of research before purchasing this camera and I can proudly say that it was a very good decision. The picture quality is great, and the camera is very easy to use. Included software is great and it is easy to upload pictures from the camera to your desktop. Mpeg movie option is great also. The only complaint I have is that it does not include any rechargable batteries / charger, the included AA alkaline batteries don't last more than few hours. I am very impressed with this camera and would highly recommend it to anyone who is considering a low priced high quality digital camera.","I just want buy this one. But I find there's no AC power adapter included. Does the Sony DSC-P30 has a jack for AC power adaper? and where can I buy one?","The e-mail feature is great (even though at first glance, it looks like a waste of marketing).  When then camera is in email mode, it will save the high-quality picture, AND it will save a 15k copy of the picture.  This \"thumbnail version\" is a very handy size to post to a personal website.<br />The high-quality setting will take 550k/picture so the included 4mb card will hold 7 pictures.  If you don't use the extra digital zoom, you will get 4x6 prints that are worthy of framing.","Upgrades you NEED!!!<br />...Battery and Charger...16 MB Memory Stick----MSA-16A<br />You NEED the Battery and Charger because normal batteries only last about 15 min.<br />You NEED the 16 MB Memory Stick because the camera only comes with a 4 MB Stick and that is DEFINATELY not enough.","I already had a Sony DSC S50 for myself and was looking for another less expensive camera for my daughter.  I purchased the  P30 for her and assumed that it was accessorized like my own camera.  After purchase, I realized that the camera kit DID NOT INCLUDE a rechargeable power supply or recharger.  The supplied AA batteries will only last about 2 hours under the best conditions. The batteries were shot by the time I familiarized myself with the operating manual. You can purchase an accessory kit from Sony for about $99 that includes a rechargable lithium battery, charger, and a camera case. I would have preferred to purchase the camera with this equipment included.","Ive had a few digital cameras in the past 2 years, but none of the came to the quality and features that I wanted. Being the techno freak I am, I wanted a camera that could do anything I wanted it to. I was almost set on an Olympus when this Sony came in at my work. It was love at first site. For a bit more money I was getting a much better zoom, movie recorder and Sony quality. Needless to say, I got it on my Birthday and I could not be happier. Setting it up is incredibly easy *as most of Sony products are* and using it makes even a novice an expert with a few hours of practice. The layout of the camera is comfortable and lightweight, Easily held in one hand to take pictures. The LCD is bright and crisp and show almost no slowdown when viewing it. A very nice turn nob selects the mode on the camera, No more fiddling with menus on the LCD. The 3xoptical zoom is great when you want to get a little closer. An optional 6xdigital is there to, but the pictures turn out to fuzzy. This camera could do anything you want it to, macro shots, low light, fast action, low light, low background light, movies,clip art, clip motion, red eye reduction and more! The menus system is very straightforward, hard to screw up. Picture quality is awesome. Though sometimes a bit soft, easily rectified with the Photosuite 8.1 the camera comes with. It would be hard pressed to get a better program without spending alot of money. Installation of the USB software takes just minutes, and a full 32 meg Stick takes just 30 seconds to upload. *no more serial!*<br />One bad side, this thing eats batteries like Joan Collins goes through makeup. I went through 6AA alkaline in 3 hours the first day. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting rechargebles, Nickel Metal Hydride perferred, this camera loves its batteries.<br />Also, recommend getting a bigger Sony Stick, the included 4 meg only does 6 pics at highest setting, a 32meg will get you 50. *what I use*<br />In all, I am very much enjoying this camera and taking great photos. If you interested in seeing what some look like email me at icewind@montana.com and I'll give you a link. For people who want to get into the Digital realm but want a low price for great quality, the SONY DSC-P30 is absolutely hard to beat!","After much online reasearch I decides on this digital camera for the price and list of features. In a day of online shopping I found this camera for $267 including shipping charges. I'm a longtime 35mm user (an Olympus IS-30 DLX)and wanted something that was compact, had good image quality and could record short video clips. This camera does all this just fine. The bad part is that only a 4 mb memory stick is included and when taking photos at the highest res this camera ofers you'll get abt 5 pics on the memory stick. Also get the rechargable battery the 2 AA's that came with the camera lasted me 4hrs or abt 20 pics. For the prcie and list of features you get, I don't think this camera can be beat. An additional gripe is that the memory sticks are quite pricey but once you pic up one 64 mb stick you shoud be fine. Sev people I know have this camera and there computer is running windows ME and they had problems. My pc is running Windows ME, the upgrade from windows 98 (1st edition) and it works fine.","I really like this camera. It was easy to install the drivers on both my MAC and my PC. I have already uploaded pics to both computers and used them on ebay auctions with no problem. I was pleasently surprised to find a Sony camera in this price range and it has lived up to my expectations. Some people have said it eats batteries and I guess that is true with all of these cameras. You will definetly have to buy a battery pack and recharger as well as extra memory sticks. But once all of that is purchased it is all set.","This is my first attempt at a digital camera, and I feel very fortunate to have purchased this one. I did a lot of research online, looking for models that were not over $300, that would work on both my PC and my MAC. I also wanted to be able to use a USB connection. After alot of searching, I was pretty sure I was going to get the Kodak with MP3 player and Video, but when I got to the store and found this Sony, I was quick to change my mind. After comparing the 2 and realizing that for only about $40 more I could have so many more features, I went for it. It has a great LCD to catch the action and has an optical as well as digital zoom. I also like the fact that it has a lens cover. It is very small and easy to hold when taking pictures. I am very disapointed, however, in the short battery life, but guess that goes along with just about any digicam. The 4mb memory stick is also pretty disapointing, but both of these things can be taken care of by buying accessories. I had no problem taking photos and I had no problem installing the drivers onto either of my computers. Pictures showed up where they were supposed to and I have already used them on a few auctions. Sony has always been good to me and I expect to get a lot of years out of this camera. Also the instruction booklet is very precise and easy to understand. One more gripe, if you will, is I would have liked to have seen them include audio in the videos I can take, but overall this is a fine camera in my opinion!","This camera is great! Its compact in size, so it goes everywhere with me, it got tons of feature for the prize you pay. The LCD display is sharp and very clear. The only downside is that it goes throught batteries quickly, the batteries that come with it, didn't even last the frist day... so plan to spend some more on the sony's rechargable batteries and charger. Or get some rechargable NiMH batteries yourself. But overall great product for its prize."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P50","amazon_reviews":["The one thing I have bad to say about my camera (a 1.3 megapixel - very similar looking to the above) is that the movies have no sound.

You pay for the customer support, the quality of merchandise and of course the cool sony logo.<br />The pictures are outstanding. Having tried a few other cameras at similar res. this one is fine, its taken a roasting over the high light levels it needs, indeed they do need to be high, but ive found most other cameras also do.<br />The battery consumption is average-good for an LCD preview display camera, all those moaning should turn the LCD preview display off.<br />Its easy to handle, easy to transfer images the only thing i woulda liked is a small leather pouch with it.<br />Next an Aibo ;o)","After much research, I finally selected this camera as my second digital camera.  I'm glad I did.<br />Everything great to be said about this camera has already been said: lots of options, great pictures, reasonable price--overall a great value.  I've always been impressed with Sony products and this camera is not exception.  I use this with Windows XP and there are no problems downloading the images to the computer.<br />Two gripes that have already been mentioned.  First, the picture in the viewfinder cuts off part of the picture that's actually taken (ie--the actual picture covers more than that view).  If you use the LCD display in back, it gives you an accurate picture, but that eats up the battery.<br />Picture quality is terrific.  The 1600x1200 resolution is more than enough, as is the 2 million pixel resolution.  You really don't need that much power--especially if you're e-mailing pictures or posting them online (in fact, if you're emailing the pictures you probably want to select a lower resolution so they don't take up as much space).<br />The second gripe concerns the power.  Actually, this isn't really a gripe because this exists on ALL digital camera.  The people that whine about this must not have researched/tested other digital cameras.  They all eat up power.  The oft recommended solution has worked for me: spend [$] on Energizer's rechargeable 4-pack  (with recharger) and you'll never worry about power.  I've left the camera on for almost 2 hours with sporadic use without having to change them.  It only uses 2 batteries at a time, so keep the other pair charged and you'll always have a fresh pair.  In contrast, I used regular batteries in them and they lasted under 15 minutes.<br />Overall, a solid camera with plenty of features to keep the advanced-amateur happy.--JPN","I love this camera! Small enough to fit in my pocket and takes excellent, clear pictures! Picture taking has never been as much fun for me as it is with this digital (which is always with me). I really enjoy uploading the latest and sending to friends (who comment on the quality, too, by the way). However, even though I give it 5 stars (for quality, size, weight) I must admit that the sticker price for the accessories was a shock. For example, I use NiMH rechargeable batteries (several sets just in case) and refuse to pay the list price for the combination power cord and battery made for the camera. That hasn't been a problem for me, though. I highly recommend this camera!","I bought this camera about 6 months ago. After reviewing some of this reviews I included the starter kit and more memory along with the shop. It's a little bit pricey buy but it's the only way to go. I have taken about 1700 photos so far and am very happy with the quality of the images. It`s very simple to use, and the fact that is mapped as a drive in your pc allows you to up-load images again to the camera. I have done this to show some  previous photos to a group of friends using the video cable and a TV set (and some beers, of course). Great if you don't print to paper and do not have a PC around. Up-loading to the camera allows you other trick: I have used the camera memory to take some big files from the office to my home computer (pretty much as one of this USB disk are appearing now). I greatly recommend this camera.","When I first bought this camera I was a bit dissapointed...I encoutered all the problems listed in the other reviews :<br />1. poor battery life<br />2. only 4mb memory stick<br />3. needs good light to take good pictures.<br />So, I went and bought the infolithium battery with a charger and 64mb... the price went up considerably.<br />After all this you may wonder why I rated this camera with 5 stars? The reason is that first of all, all of the above problems are found in one way or anoher in all digital cameras (something like a dc trademark) and with the accessories I bought, the camera has transformed into a very powerful device. Although the accesories increased the price a lot, if you compare similarly priced cameras(after the increase), you will find that still this camera outperforms the rest.","I really like this camera. It's my first digital camera and I'm not at all into photography as a hobby, so I can't speak to the complaints people listed about it being 41 mm, etc. But if you're not looking for a professional's camera, this works great. DEFINITELY buy the battery pack... it's somewhat pricey but well worth it... using batteries is just a waste and you'd spend the amount of the lithium pack in batteries relatively quickly. You'll also need to buy a new memory stick, the 4 MB it comes with doesn't do much for you. I use my camera mainly for e-mail pics and web posting and have found this was a good purchase, I'm very happy with it.","If you buy this camera, make sure you purchase the \"optional\" rechargeable lithium battery and power pack.  This camera eats batteries.  A set of 2 double-A batteries will last about 4 to 5 pictures if you use the flash.  If you use the flash and the LCD screen, you might only get 2 to 3 minutes of camera life, enough for just a couple pictures.<br />It's very easy to accidentally set the camera to take pictures at slower shutter speeds.  The results are very blurry pictures.  So the camera is not exactly fool-proof, and with such short battery life with the LCD screen on, you have to flip through the options very quickly to retain your battery life (which leads to mistakes in setting the exposure time, etc.)<br />I hope these problems I'm having with battery life will be relieved once I purchase the optional battery pack.  As it is, the camera is almost un-usable with normal batteries.","Ditto the rest on memory and battery usage... I get around 50 1600x1200 shots with my 64MB memory stick... and around 45 minutes from the lith-ion battery (using flash and the view screen on every shot)...<br />My only criticism is the need to use the flash on every shot... Pictures are just too dark without it... I'm sure they would be fine with light directed at the target.  But this is the same with every other camera I have seen...<br />What really makes this camera stand out is the ability to view pictures as thumbnails in the built in mini screen... as well as some basic zooming and cropping features built right into the camera interface (no PC needed for this)!","I entered the shop with the view of buying a video camera that takes stills and I left with this!!  It came bundled with the InfoLithium accessory pack and I can get over an hour taking pictures without the flash but with the LCD on.  Downloading is a breeze with USB.  Picture quality excellent and it's easy to use.  Consider seriously!","I bought this camera for two reasons:<br />  Taking snaps (friends, holidays etc).<br />  Taking pictures of text (in books, like in a library).<br />For snaps: the pictures are quite sharp, but I feel you could<br />get more out of 2.1 mega pixels. I'd like to see a comparison<br />with a Canon D30.<br />The colors are quite saturated, especially<br />the greens, perhaps too saturated.<br />On the screen the colors look even more saturated. A Nikon 775<br />at a friends place looked a lot more neutral.<br /> Macro mode was quite impressive: no loss of contrast here.<br />It's great fun getting close ups of flowers etc...<br />For archiving text: The \"text\" mode saves pictures as black and<br />white gif files (so quite compressed). However the camera becomes<br />so slow you might as well forget it. Something like 10 to<br />15 seconds between shots at high res. Besides which the result<br />was a lot less readable than the JPEG file. In fact I took<br />a picture of a page of printed text from an art book and the<br />result was unreadable in Text mode, and very readable in<br />JPEG mode. So what's the point.<br />As for eating batteries, I get about 2 hours with the Lithium<br />Ion battery (for which I had to shell out a lot more money).<br />A comparison of battery consumption in a mag showed that this<br />camera was rather average on that score.<br />I thouroughly disagree about the remark on how difficult it<br />is to upload the pictures to a PC, in fact it's as easy as<br />copying and pasting files from one disk to another and looks<br />just like that on your Windows Explorer.","This camera was a christmas gift. So far (about 1 week) I love it! The picture quality is amazing, and the ease of use is even better. Pop in a memory stick take a picture, upload. MPEG EX lets you take 70 minute movies (no audio) on a 128MB memory stick. This camera is very small and has a viewfinder for quick point-and-shoot pictures. The LCD also has the option to turn off, saving battery life. Which brings up another thing. This camera can use 2 AA's. Although they only last 15-20 minutes it is a great life-saver if the big battery dies and you have some AAs. I recommend buying the Info lithium battery. Overall, this camera is a very high quality camera. If your thinking about a high-quality consumer level camera, check this one out.","I got this camera as a gift after my previous digital camera broke.  The only problem was that I tried to use it with AA batteries, and I could not even turn on the camera.  I figured out that this camera will not work without the Sony Stamina battery, and that the Kit (rechargable battery, charger and bag), which costs almost ($$$).<br />After that initial problem, it's been only good times with this camera. The pictures quality are great, and the camera is really easy to use, without those complicated menus that others digital cameras have.  Uploading the files (pictures) to my computer was easy, and now that I'm using Windows XP is a lot better.<br />If you're looking for an easy-to-use, high-quality camera, this is a good choice for you.  However, keep in mind that you'll need to expend a ($$$) more for the battery kit.<br />Picture colors are not good at all, I'll choose a Canon next time","I bought this camera about two weeks ago and I have been very happy with it.  The picture quality is very good -- esp. if your using it for web purposes.<br />My only problems are as follows:<br />True, the viewfinder is only about 70% of the actual picture size.<br />It eats batteries like *crazy*<br />It doesn't handle low-light pictures very well<br />Twilight mode -- you have to have a very still subject and a very still hand to take a decent picture in twilight mode (although I've gotten some really cool looking blurs)<br />All in all it's a great camera for the price.  I checked out some other more expensive cameras that werent' nearly as good as this Sony.","I recently purchased a Sony DSC-P50 to replace a broken point and shoot 35mm. I needed a camera that I could use for work and one that my wife could use easily and more important download with ease. After reading previous reviews I purchased the Sony with the battery kit and 64mb memory stick. I was downloading pictures on the net inside of 30 minutes and had it pretty much operational in a day or so. I am not a camera or photography buff so I wasnt looking at those kind of issues. I wanted a 2.0+ megapixel camera that was easy to use and easy to download. So far I am very happy with this purcahse as it satified all my needs. My only thought would be-make the carry bag a little bigger.","I have recently bought a Sony DSC P50 digital camera.  I am impresssed by its high resolution and compact size.  The LCD is somehow a bit small, but you can still see the objects clearly.","I recently got this camera. Here are the things I noticed<br />1) You must have the Rechargeable Nimh 1600 amph batteries atleast 4 at hand.(better you order the sony starter or stamina kit, comes with charger, battery and cover)<br />2) Duracell AA(reg) batteries lasted for 4 pictures with flash and about 7 min of playing with the menu.<br />3) I feel the quality of the image is good. I also feel the image is slightly darker on the right or as a whole when you take in the night time probably because the flash isn't powerful enough. To get a better picture in the night you must be within 5ft max.<br />4) The pictures taken at the daytime are amazing the best of the cameras so far.<br />5) Mpeg has no audio but can record upto your memory stick capacity.(previous models have audio but they allow you to record upto 15sec(dsc-s50))<br />6)I agree with one of the prev reviews saying the viewfinder only shows approx 70% of the actual picture taken<br />Overall I would give 8/10 and I would recommend this to others.<br />thanks,<br />Jag","I am new to digital cameras; however, starting to use this camera required a new battery at almost every three pictures. It is easy to use and I like all other aspects. My computer does not have a USB port thus I am still trying to activate the floppy disc attachment in order to store and then print the photos. I believe these cameras should use less power with easy to use batteries.","The P-50 and Canon A20 were my final two choices.  I decided to go with the P-50 because it used only 2AA batteries and had the MPEG and Clip Movie recording features which is very neat.<br />I'm glad I went with the P-50.  Here is my pro and con list for the P-50:<br />Pros:<br />* 3 optical zoom (it zooms fast)<br />* Uses 2 AA batteries.  Don't get the battery pack.  Just get 6 NiMh batteries with a rating of at least 1600mha, which are inexpensive.  I got 4 Energizer 1600 mha NiMh batteries and a recharger at Target for only $...  NiMH batteries last twice as long as alkalines and I haven't had to worry about my batteries dying.<br />* MPEG and Clip (GIF) movie modes are real fun.  No sound on the MPEG, but spending an extra $... for a camera with sound wasn't worth it to me.  For you who design web pages, you'll love the Clip (GIF) movie mode.<br />* Memory Stick, although expensive, is much more compact and stores more memory.  However, the 4MB stick that comes with the camera is lame unless you plan to take only lower quality resolutions.  I got a 64MB stick and at FINE quality (if using STANDARD quality, double all the numbers below) can hold the following: 67 1600x1200, 174 1024 x768, 400 640x480.  As you can see that's alot of pictures.<br />* ISO flexibility and twilight mode.  This helps when shooting in low light.  The AF illuminator really helps the camera to focus in low light.<br />* Can crop pictures and cut MPEGs.<br />* If you change the Power Save mode to \"off\", then the camera lag time (a common complaint in these reviews) after you take a picture is very minimal.  It's actually fast compared to other digital cameras I've used.<br />* Very fast transfer rate using the USB driver.  The camera becomes another drive in Windows Explorer that you just drag to your hard drive.  Very fast.  I have Windows ME which allows Windows Explorer to view in thumbnail mode, so I can even preview all the pictures before moving them to the hard drive.<br />* The video out mode is cool.  Just plug in the supplied jack cord to your P-50 and to your TV or VCR and see a slide show of your pictures you just took.<br />* If you auto-focus by pressing the shutter button half way, then the camera takes the picture very fast with almost no lag time, unlike other digital cameras in this price range,<br />* 37mm threads and the fact the optical zoom stays within the camera allows you to use an UV filter for better picture quality and as a lens protector.<br />* You can view your pictures taken also in thumbnail mode.  Also, the camera tells you your settings (i.e shutter speed, iso, EV, etc.) of the picture.<br />* The camera allows the option to imprint the date onto your digital photos.  This is a must for me as I never remember the date of the picture without this feature.<br />* The lens cap comes with a lens strap so you won't lose your cap.<br />Cons:<br />* 41mm lens.  If you know photography, you will realize that most SLRs and point and shoots have 35mm lens.  The lower the number, the better the wide angle, which allows you to take more area from the same distance making your objects also larger.  However, the above pros by far outweigh this.  If you're not a camera junkie like I am, you probably won't even notice this.<br />* The viewfinder only shows approx 70% of the actual picture taken and is slighty \"skewed\" to the left.  If you think you got your object centered using the viewfinder, you'll will find out that the subject will be slightly left in the actual picture.  The way around this is to use the LCD, which shows 100% of the actual picture and is not skewed.<br />All in all, in the 2.1 megapixel range and under $... as of 9/8/01, I feel this camera is the best one.","One thing to beware right now with any Sony electronics product is Sony's pitiful service capability.  I shipped my DSC-P50 to Sony over three weeks ago. The problem?  It wouldn't turn on. Maybe the battery, maybe the recharger for the battery, or maybe it's internal to the camera.  I shipped it all back.  The address of the service center was a secret. They have consolidated their service centers, and my camera has been shipped by Sony from Podunk, PA, where I sent it, to Boston, where it is apparently riding beneath the streets with poor Charlie on the MTA. Or, it has been handed off from one technician to another and may be underneath a large pile in a large warehouse.  Today the word is, they might be finished on the 19th, which will make it five weeks since I shipped it although they claim their average is 10 working days.  If I were shopping for a new camera I'd avoid any Sony product.","It is the best deal for digital cameras of 2.1 Mpixel, that can be found on the market and the most complete camera of its type. I fully recommend it, as well as to buy the rechargeable batteries and AC Adapter.","I decided to purchase this camera instead of the olympus 2040 and I am glad I did. It takes great clear pictures and has a great zoom. It's compact size is just right. It does eat batteries so I would get the info-lithium with charger. I purchased the wide angle lens and a 64mb memory stick. With the 64mb memory stick you get about 120 pictures at 1600x1200 jpeg mode, TIFF mode takes up much more memory. If you plan on printing pictures as big as 11x14 that's great. The lower setting will yield very high quality 5x7's or 4x6's. I find that if you take pictures at a very high setting and then try to shrink them to fit smaller paper they are not as clear (This is with any digital camera) It is very easy to use and it takes MPEG movies. Even editing within the camera is easy. Downloading pictures is real easy too. The software is great and easy to use. As with any SONY product the accesories cost more. But if you shop around you could find comparable prices. I highly recomend this camera.","This camera was a Father's Day present in June and I loved it right from the start. Unfortunately, the batteries that come with it lasted about as long as it took to set it up. Fortunately, I was in Chicago the next week and bought the Sony Starter kit which includes a charger and case. I think this is a must have for this camera. Also purchased a 32K Memory stick and wide angle lens (the cheaper lens).<br />The camera itself is great, easily fits in my right hand, and is ruggedly made. We spent two weeks in Europe this summer during which I (stupidly) dropped it twice and no problems. We took hundreds of pictures and I loved the freedom of taking as many pictures as I wanted, downloading them to a Powerbook and then going out for more.<br />I am still learning to use some of the advanced settings in the camera. One thing I've seen is that it is very important to track the white balance setting.<br />The charger works fairly rapidly and with a plug adapter can be used on European current. The wide angle lens has been a disappointment. I also purchased a PCMIA card reader  for my powerbook which has been a great convenience.<br />I would unhesitatingly recommend this camera.","This camera takes very good pictures, the menus are easy to use, it is small, the flash is very powerful and the lens is of good quality.<br />Two small drawbacks: 1. The camera literally eats batteries, like a ton of customers said before me. I tried to use NiMH rechargeable batteries from RadioShack and after only one flash, the batteries would be dead, very unconvenient. I recommend buying the Lithium-Ion Pack with the AC adapter (if not you can't recharge it), just buy the starter kit it has the Li-Pack, the AC Adapter and a nice case for the camera (can't hold any additional lenses though).<br />2. And I think no one talked about it so far is the button to OK command in the menus. You have a cross-shaped pad, just like a video console controller, that you have to press straight in the middle to OK functions. Other functions are carried by the up, down, left and right hands of the cross. It is sometimes difficult to press straight down on the cross, and if you don't do that, it makes your selection move in the menu, which is a little bit frustrating. And that happens even after a couple weeks of using the camera... Not a big drawback, but still it's good to know.<br />All things considered, great choice, probably the best 2 MPixels-range Digital Camera on the market for the first half of 2001.","Ive had a few digital cameras in the past 2 years, but none of the came to the quality and features that I wanted. Being the techno freak I am, I wanted a camera that could do anything I wanted it to. I was almost set on an Olympus when this Sony came in at my work. It was love at first site. For a bit more money I was getting a much better zoom, movie recorder and Sony quality. Needless to say, I got it on my Birthday and I could not be happier. Setting it up is incredibly easy *as most of Sony products are* and using it makes even a novice an expert with a few hours of practice. The layout of the camera is comfortable and lightweight, Easily held in one hand to take pictures. The LCD is bright and crisp and show almost no slowdown when viewing it. A very nice turn nob selects the mode on the camera, No more fiddling with menus on the LCD. The 3xoptical zoom is great when you want to get a little closer. An optional 6xdigital is there to, but the pictures turn out to fuzzy. This camera could do anything you want it to, macro shots, low light, fast action, low light, low background light, movies,clip art, clip motion, red eye reduction and more! The menus system is very straightforward, hard to screw up. Picture quality is awesome. Though sometimes a bit soft, easily rectified with the Photosuite 8.1 the camera comes with. It would be hard pressed to get a better program without spending alot of money. Installation of the USB software takes just minutes, and a full 32 meg Stick takes just 30 seconds to upload. *no more serial!*<br />One bad side, this thing eats batteries like Joan Collins goes through makeup. I went through 6AA alkaline in 3 hours the first day. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting rechargebles, Nickel Metal Hydride perferred, this camera loves its batteries.<br />Oh, and im talking about the 1.3pixel model. I now have the DSC-P50 and wow, the pictures are even better quality! Well worth the extra [money]the P50 costs!<br />Also, recommend getting a bigger Sony Stick, the included 4 meg only does 3 pics at highest setting, a 32meg will get you 34. *what I use*<br />In all, I am very much enjoying this camera and taking great photos....For people who want to get into the Digital realm but want a low price for great quality, the SONY DSC-P30 is absolutely hard to beat! For a bit more room to grow and higher res for wallpapers and print outs, get the DSC-P50. Either way, your getting one of the best camrea's on the market bar none!","The DSC P50 is an excellent digicam.  Picture quality, features, price.  The macro mode focuses as close as 1 inch.  This is extraordinary for any camera out of the box.<br />I have seen many reviews complaining about the batteries and not having an included ac adapter or charger and why do I have to buy extra accessories and so on.  Very few digicams come with complete power setup and accessory pack.  Check the included accessories in product listings.<br />I recommend using NiMH AA rechargeable instead of the expensive infoLithium.  Get about 8 batteries and a charger.  This can be done for half the price of the and charger.<br />Also pick up at least a 32mb Memory Stick.  64mb if you can afford it.  But shop around.  Memory sticks can be found for less than some of the major outfitters charge.","This camera is actually a good camera for the price, the major complaint was that it didn't come w/ a lithium battery. But you can order a \"Value-Pack\" from Sony that includes a battery, charger and a nice case. So that wasn't much of a problem, I also recommend getting a 32 or 64 MB Memory stick, my 64 mb stick can hold about 66 high quality (1600x1200), and about 160 (1024 X 768), and of course about 370 (640X480) Which is a alot of pictures, and about 11 min of video (mpeg)w/o sound. I would strongly recommend buying the \"Info-lithium battery\" from Sony (comes in Value-pack), because it displays how many minutes of battery life you have remaining, which comes in handy. Normal AA batteries could die on you without warning! One other thing that bothered me, was the lag time of the camera after it took a picture, but all \"digital\" cameras that I've seen seem to do this; you take a picture w/ flash and after the picture is recorded the screen goes blank for a couple seconds, but if you take a picture w/o flash, there is no lag time. I guess the price you have to pay for getting a digital camera.  Overall a really good camera, the optical zoom is nice too.","The DSC-P50 is my first digital camera ~ and I love it! It's so easy to use, takes beautiful pictures, I love the mpeg feature (although once you use it you'll wish you had sound). I bought a \"Floppy Disk Adapter\" so I can just plug my memory stick in the adapter, stick it in my floppy drive and download from there.  It's slower that way, but if you don't have a USB port and don't want to add anymore cables to your computer, it's totally convenient and easy.  There are still more features I'm learning about this camera!  Great buy!  (p.s. I also purchased the InfoLithium S battery and it takes about 2 hours of pictures :)","...I will say yes it loves batteries like any other but it only uses 2 AA not 4 like my old AGFA, Storing HUGE pictures you say? buy a higher memory card and use a lower resolution, I get 488 pictures from my memory stick (32mb) and thats more than enough., Who needs an image bigger than the screen? ... Example?: Went to NJ last week 100+ pictures on 2 Duracell batteries my Agfa woulda been about 6 sets of 4 AA's... Rob","excellent camera, only i have to agree with the battery problem, figure this camera is $100 more than that price (for the accessory pack) but well worth it","That's right! Something that Sony doesn't tell you when you read the specs on this sucker! I bought mine and tried it out right away. It came with a set of batteries that I plugged in and started shooting. As far as taking pictures, it's pretty striaghtforward and easy to use. Here's the catch.<br />When I went to download the pictures onto my laptop, I opened up the manual and guess what it says? \"Do not use battery power to download pictures to computer. You must use the dc power supply\". Hmmm... So I rummage through the box and guess what there's no power supply. You have to buy it seperately!<br />You'd think that for $..., Sony could throw in a stupid power cord! I mean charge me more for it or whatever but I was pretty...[mad] that it didn't come with the camera. Also, it only comes with regular batteries - which is fine but using them to download pictures drains batteries dead.<br />So if you want the power supply and perhaps the battery it's going to cost you another $... You can get the Starter Pack which includes battery, charger, and case for $... If you seriously want this camera order it at the same time to avoid frustration.","I love everything about this camera. To refute the short battery life claims of other reviewers, I would like to point out that sony does not recommend standard batteries. If you buy some rechargeable nickle metal hydrate batteries ($15 for a 4 pack and charger) the battery life is wonderful. I can take hundreds of pictures on a single charge. You will not be dissapointed with this camera if you are looking in the 2 megapixel class.","The only thing I would like to see on AMAZON is better descriptions on items, this one has no details so ill give them to you all since I now own 3!, Sony 2.1-Megapixel Cyber-Shot Digital Camera Model: DSC-P50 3x optical and 6x digital zooms get you in close to your subject, while a high-speed, auto-focus illuminator lends sharp focus in the dark (this was really neat, sort of a night-vision option), Memory stick storage (comes with a 4-meg), LCD viewer and the older \"peep-hole\" style allowing you to shut the LCD off for longer battery life, on/off optional Flash, USB connections and even an mpeg video mode to let you capture and ceate your own movie shorts (no sound), Very simple to use once you get the buttons down, Only thing I didnt like was no rechargeable battery pack?? or power cord??, (they sell them seperately), a plus+ is that like I said the LCD can be shut off saving your AA batteries from drainage so fast like most camera do!, Smallest resolution 640x480 (real sharp) largest is 1600x1200, also SOLARIZE, B&W, SEPHIA & NEGATIVE ART Image modes when taking pictures// very neat, white balance controls and normal/fine picture modes, sharpness, flash level and ISO controls often ignored on other cameras are ON THIS ONE!, To me as a buyer..

Having almost exclusively used this camera since then, I can confidently say that I know the Sony DSC-S75 from inside out.

This Sony model camera is very easy to learn how to use and takes terrific pictures, and short mpeg and avi movies with sound.  Has all the manual control features you find on much more expensive models.  The only negative about this camera is that it's hard to find new as it has been discontinued by Sony.","I had originally purchased one of these cameras back in 1999 for a trip to Europe.  Since it was Sony and a worldwide company, I was able to purchase the adapter to charge in any country very easily.  That was the first plus for me on this one, with many more to come.<br />The camera takes pictures with ease (especially since this was my first digital camera back then).  Easy to learn on, yet perfect for the expert.  Additional lenses may be purchased (wide angle, etc.) on eBay or any site similar for rather cheap.<br />I had to repurchase this camera again this year because the camera my ex-husband and I had was so great that we fought over it in the divorce and I lost!  LOL.  I bought my new one on eBay (got it for about $50) and still love it.  VERY easy to use, yet it has so many options that I still cannot find on digitals.  I had also owned a Panasonic digital and another Sony, but came back to this one because of all the options and wonderful picture quality.  Very highly recommended!","The is the best camera ever!

We have tried 5 different expensive cameras with about twice as many MP's and none are as good as this one! I love this camera, my sister said when we bought a new one she wanted this one because it was better then her camera that was 500 Euros! Too bad it broke! I am thinking of getting the same camera again b/c we can't find any newer ones that are better! This Camera rocks!","I received my Sony Cybershot in 2001 for Christmas. It is now just about 5 years later and my Sony Cybershot is still functioning wonderfully and I have put a lot of miles on that camera! Really good sound quality, really great photos, lots of features... I'm still learning new ones! And what an awesome price. If this one ever breaks down and needs replacing, I wouldn't mind purchasing the exact same one. I do realize there are cameras out there with many upgrades and higher prices, but seriously... this camera does just what I need.","I've owned this camera for about 4 years and have had great success with it.  As other reviewers have stated, the lag time in capturing an image is a major issue - but when I bought this camera - it was state of the art.  For that reason I've upgraded to the Sony DSC-V3 which has practically no lag time - it's great for capturing pictures of my grand-daughter as she zips through the family room.<br /><br />The S75 has been a great camera - aside from the lag time the only other problem I've had is while reviewing images in play back mode, sometimes it will take off with itself uncontrolably scanning through all of the pictures on the stick - very annoying.<br /><br />I'm giving the S75 to my college graduate so can take pictures while traveling on his new job.","Bought this about 3 years ago and have been very happy with it.","If you get to know this camera you'll get excellent pictures. I use to have an SLR camera and I haven't use it since I bought this one. By the way I have like 4 years and it is in excellent conditions since","Love this camera, Sharp pictures, easy to use, tough, a feature for every situation if you chose to get fancy.  Recharagable battery lasts long and charges quick.  Negs would be: slight delay between button pressed and pic taken, but seems this is common at this price range.  Had it 2 years and taken 4000 pictures.","This would get five stars if it didn't take so long to take a picture. As noted in other reviews, there is a significant lag between pressing the button and taking the picture - a real negative when dealing with kids or action pictures.<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />The ability to take a picture in one size and save it later as a different size. This is great for saving small files for emails, and also saving the same picture in a larger format so it has enough detail to print a crisp and clear picture.<br /><br />The camera uses the same battery, memory stick and power cord as my Sony digital video camera. Less stuff to pack and carry with you on vacation.","Not a Pro, but I can vouch for this camera. Great product from Sony. You'll not be disappointed.","I'm what you might call a kindergarten photographer... I've taken a few good shots, but I don't know anything about cameras, and I've never taken any photography classes or even tried to learn much of anything, really. The only two things guiding my shots are the 3 years of art classes I took in grade school and an hour or two with the User's Manual. That said, this camera does a great job! It's so easy to use and the pictures turn out so good! Even a novice like me can take beautiful pictures...just don't forget to read the manual","I love this camera!  The picture quality is great, it's so easy to use, and storage is a snap!  I can't ask for much more.<br />A few of the upsides - You can use either the regular view window or the large color screen to take your pics; replace the 4MB Sony memory stick that comes with the camera with a larger one (I went with 128MB and have yet to run out of room!), and you've got huge storage possibilities; you get multiple resolutions, so your pictures are always clear; you can view the pictures you've already taken, so if you took a bad one you can retake it right then and there.<br />I can honestly say I've only taken a couple of bad pictures with this camera, and the cause was operator error.  If you want a great digital camera for an affordable price, this is the one.","I purchased A Sony DCS-S75 Digital camera and consider it one of the best buys that I have ever made. The ability to see the picture you have just taken eliminates the guess work from taking pictures. The quality of pictures that this camera produces are outstanding in my opinion. I can down load my pictures to my computer and print professional quality pictures. This camera has many options and adjustments and I have not mastered all of them but the instructions are clear and easy to understand. I would never go back to film again.","This is an awesome camera!! I am a die hard \"still camera\" person.  I always said that a digital could never produce the quality and clarity of my Cannon EOS Rebel \"still\" camera.<br />I will have to say I have almost switched completely!! I absolutely love my Sony Cybershot!!  I take pictures alot.  It is very user friendly.  I love that it takes black and white and the sepia tone.  I take pictures that look like professional prints.  I take my memory stick or a cd up to [a local store] and print them on their photo machine.  I can't tell the difference between my still camera and my digital prints.  It also does little mini movies.  They are great to email to grand-ma.  It is very durable.  My husband did his research and found that this one had the most to offer.  I would reccomend this camera HIGHLY!!","I am not a photographic fanatic, nor am I an expert in the area of the photography.  I simply bought this because after 2 weeks of research, I decided it was the best price/feature combo in the 3MP range (when it was still available on Amazon).  ...  Was I ever right, I have been strutting around with this and comparing it to my friends and relatives cameras for awhile now, and I love watching the shocked (or jealous) look on their faces when I told them how much, I mean how little, I paid for it.  I am not going to go on about the features since you can read yourselves, but I have taken pictures in every imaginable conditions, sunny, dark, rainy, indoor w/ or w/o lights, even on a sunny day after overnight snow when the glare off the snow was overwhelming, the pictures always come out looking good.  Of course, it pays to read the manual and know some extra tricks.  So good luck if you can find one, don't hesitate to buy it.","This camara is NOT for somebody that want to just take a few snapshots every once and a while to stick on a web page, and maybe make a print once in a blue moon for a really good shot.  If you want something like that, there are camaras that are smaller, lighter, cheaper, and easier to use.<br />This camara is NOT for somebody who is a photo fanatic.  If you want razor-sharp prints the size of posters, or if you want to take pictures of hummingbirds in flight, there are camaras that have interchangeable lenses, higher resolution and better image controls.<br />If you are semi-serious about your photography, require a good lens, decent control over the photos, and spectacular batter life, this camara is an excellent value.<br />Equipped with an excellent (if bulky) Zeiss lens, this camara can produce much better pictures than other three (and even four) mega-pixel camaras that only have tiny, small things.  One thing you must remember is that mega-pixels are useless if the lens cannot deliver detail that fine to the camara.  This lens can.  The 3MP it has will do just fine for any size print up to and including 8x10's.<br />The user interface for the camara is simple enough, which makes up for the somewhat lousy manual.  My only complaint about the controls is that the cursor movement button is hard to center correctly.  This is a minor point, as I have never had it cause a problem other than me having to hit the button twice.<br />The pictures are razor sharp and the camara is capable of perfect white balance.  (For those that don't know, bad white balance is what causes some pictures under flourescent light to look green, and incadescents look yellow.)  All you have to do to adjust it to perfect every time is to keep a white index card in your camara case and then use the \"one touch\" balance control to re-calibrate it in a couple of seconds.<br />You can make small movies with this unit, but they aren't suitable for anything but posting to the web.  Let's face it, this isn't a camcorder.<br />The included rechargable lithium battery is more than enough for a full day or two of shooting, but if you won't have access to a car or electrical outlet, it could be a problem, since it isn't a AA you can pick up at any corner store.  (That means that you can't use this camara for your 10-week trek through the wilderness.)<br />This camara includes only an insultingly small 8 MB memory stick.  However, I believe that everyone with a 3MP camara should own a 128MB chip, and NO camara maker includes one that big.  Buy one when you buy the camara.  Since other manufacturers besides Sony now make them, they are very reasonably priced.<br />You can buy accessories like a flash, an adapter for 52mm filters, additional lenses, etc., but the cheaper non-sony brands are tough (but not impossible) to find.<br />The included software (MGI Photosuite) is not really that good, but not bad for a bundled package.  I reccommend, and use, Microsoft Picture It! Digital Image Pro.<br />All in all, for the price this camara costs, it is the best available and has no competition.<br />P.S. If you have windows XP, you MUST change the USB Transfer mode from the default.  If you don't, it won't work.  See the manual and the sony website for details.","This is my 2nd digital camera (my first was the Sony Mavica FD-95).  This is a pretty easy camera to use (Sony cameras have generally been user-friendly) so that the 1st time buyer can just pick it up and shoot and yet has features that you'd want if you were an intermediate to advanced user.  The resolution is great for the money although if I could I'd probably get the DSC-85 model simply for the opportunity for 4.1 megapixel as opposed to the 3.2 that you'd get with this DSC-75.  Also you can get a 3 shot burst with the 85 as opposed to the 75.  But still that's taking very little away from the 75; you still get outstanding pictures with the 75.  A couple of caveats:  although I generally don't use digital cameras for action shots (I do from time to time on an experimental basis; just not when I need money shots) I haven't used it yet for indoor action shots (e.g. basketball games) so I couldn't evaluate the burst option yet.  That said, I also feel that if I did, then you probably need an external flash as the built-in one would be inadequate for action shots.<br />A few more little squabbles:  If you do buy either the 75 or the 85, I highly recommend getting the 128 mB memory stick.  The factory 8mB stick just is inadequate; the down side is the extra $$$ for it.  But it is definitely worth it.  Also I think it records images a little slowly but that may be one of my personal quirks.<br />Overall, I feel this camera does a very good job and I highly recommend it!","It's a great camera! I am happy and impressed with everything about it!<br />It just falls short in one area..  High Resolution Video limited to 15 seconds is kind of a bummer.<br />When i first bought the camera, of course i was psyched! But one thing that I now wish.. i wish the higher resoltion video recorded--unlimited by time.<br />Besides that.. everything else is great! And it's really easy to connect to the computer--despite 'rumors' i heard.. how hard it was to set up sony cameras with computers other than sony computers.<br />There are advantages and disadvantages to owning this model.. compared to the dsc P7. I was torn between the two--however.. the DSC S75 felt like a more natural camera. I felt the DSC P7 felt a little too small for my hands. Also, the manual options on the DSC S75 made it a nice choice as well.<br />An advantage of the DSC P7 is.. unlimited High Resolution video! The mid and lower resolution video can take up the whole card.. on the DSC S75.. so it's not too bad!<br />Anyways, if you pick this model.. congrats! It's a great choice! I'm just wondering what would of happened should I of gotten the DSC P7(but that problem will be resolved.. when i buy a camcorder.)","...................P>I love the higher resolution, long life lithium ion battery (which is the same my camcorder uses), the great features (ie. manual shutter, aperture, full manual modes), and the quicker shot-to-shot capability in comparison to the camera that I upgraded from, the Sony DSC-P30 (1.3 megapixel).<br />What I did not like was the fact that the picture quality of this new camera with the \"Carl Zeiss\" lens was no better than my 1.3 megapixel DSC-P30 camera! This is not necessarily a bad thing, the very reason why I chose the DSC-P30 a year ago was because the image quality blew away most 2 megapixel cameras...but I had hoped that this more expensive camera would at least have a noticeable difference in image quality...but it DOES NOT in most shooting scenarios (at least not in my eyes)...I can say that because of the flexibility of the manual modes, I have been able to take much much better night pics than with my P30.","I purchased the Sony DSC-S75 back in June and have found it to be an excellent camera.  I shopped around and did the research thing and this was the ticket.  As other reviews have stated, the 8mb is a joke.  I bought a 64mb and then a 128mb.  I used the 128 this weekend for a birthday party and could not use it up.  I have found that I can get about 81 shots on the finest setting with the 128mb.  As far as picture quality...it is superb!! The macro lets you take beautiful crisp clear shots on flowers, close ups on faces, whatever.  I went hog wild and bought the tripod, Sony flash, lense adapter, wide angle lense, and filters.  All I can say is if you are looking for a great camera, this is it.  Highly recommend reading all of the manual.  Battery life:  have never lost power and I have been taking LOTS of pictures.","As with other manufacturers,Sony includes a laughably small 8MB memory stick. Absolutely factor in the cost of the 128 MB unit to get the \"real\" cost of buying one.<br />The flash unit (which it needs!) is proprietory (in other words, you have to buy one from Sony) and (no surprise) it's overpriced.<br />The lens cap doesn't attach to the camera... unless you buy a cord from Sony ...<br />The USB cable is non standard- ... DON\"T LOSE IT (like I did)<br />The memory is standard (thank heavens) and is decreasing in price and card readers are getting cheaper.<br />Battery life is very good, but the batteries and cables are (you guessed it!) Sony only and expensive. I would like to get a 12 V DC adapter to charge the a batteries in my car but they cost [money]...... Also, very few lens filters available and they require the use of an adaptor. Weird.<br />There is a long gap between when you \"push the button\" and when the camera actually \"shoots\" resulting in a lot of wasted shots.<br />I would rate this as \"close- no cigar.\"","I bought this camera right before our trip tp Brazil. I enjoyed the quality of the pictures we took. Just keep in mind that the 8Mb Memory Stick is not enough, at all. You will need more than that to store your pics. Another little thing that I didn't like is that it is too slow to take a picture; you push the button and have to wait a few seconds before the picture is actually recorded. I feel that anoying especially when I take picture of my pets. They do not stay steel and I end up having to take two or three pictures so I can choose one good one.<br />Anyway, I like this camera a lot and I do recommend it. I print my pictures at home and the quality is excellent. There are lots of features in the menu, and I have to admit I haven't learn all of them yet. It is very easy to use tough. Besides, it is a Sony, a brand I like and trust.","i just purchased this camera over the weekend and i think it's a pretty cool camera. the high points about this camera is the ability to manually adjust the camera's exposure settings (the aperture and the shutter speeds), it's movie mode (you can record up to 10 mins, w/sound), it fits nicely in my hand, and you can print 8x10's (i haven't tried this yet, but with 3.2 mp it shouldn't be a stretch). the only thing i didn't like was that it came packaged with an 8 mb card, which is useless. pick up at least a 64 mb stick and you should be fine. i also don't like that i have to manually put the lens cap on everytime i'm not using it, it should have an automatic cover. overall great purchase, battery lasts about 3 hrs and comes w/its' own charger. highly recommend.","I have been a proud owner of this camera for several months<br />now.I had stepped-up from previously owning the Sony DSC-S50<br />model and I couldn't be happier! I'm a \"Novice Photographer\" but<br />this camera is that \"ADVANCED\" to allow me to-be the BEST I can<br />be! I've been eagarly studying the Opt's Manual and learning ALL<br />the \"Manual Functions\" as I have'nt owned such a Camera that gave<br />Me so much Artistic Freedom!<br />  I am truly Excited with this little \"jewel\" and have Not been<br />disappointed with the Quality of photo's; Nor, the results of this DSC-S75 many options and features!<br />  I would strongly recommend getting the 64 or 128MB Memory Sticks and it wouldn't hurt to have \"More the ONE\"!!!<br />  In Conclusion,i would say; I would think even a Professional<br />Photographer would be happy with the Quality,Functionality,and<br />Handling of this \"Amaging Camera\" by Sony: You WILL NOT be Unhappy to own,this Camera!!!","Wow, this seems to be living up to the previous reviews.  I was close to buying the Nikon 885 Coolpix but this Sony has a great picture, excellent shutter speed, and plenty of features for such a compact camera.  The only downside to it is your pretty much stuck with buying Sony components (momory stick, battery, etc.) although they are only slightly more expensive than the generics Nikon accepts.  So, if you need a great digital for a good portable size, this is a good choice!","This is an excellent camera.  We just bought it after having a baby and we have taken so many pictures with it.  It is very user friendly.  The menus are easy to browse through.  I have borrowed a friend's digital camera in the past and it was nowhere near this easy to use.<br />The pictures it takes are excellent.  I don't know how I lived without a digital camera before.  It is great to have a camera that can take such high quality pictures and I can choose which ones I want to print and which ones I'll just save.","The image quality of the Sony has lived up to my high expectations; it is incredible. As a long-time amateur 35mm photographer and professional graphic artist, I really wanted a true digital SLR digital (couldn't afford $3k with lenses), but as a digital rangefinder, I am giving away very little with the DSC-S75. The manual mode combined with available spot metering gives me the control I need, and the controls are very easy to set - much easier than on most film SLR's. The overall size is small, but the rubber grip gives me a good place to hold it steady. Compared to the Nikon 995, the build quality is obviously superior. The heft of the controls is superb, and the materials are first-rate. The Nikon feels like it is made by Fisher Price. The image quality of the Sony is crisper and the colors truer, to boot. Tell me again why the Nikon is more expensive. The battery lasts a LONG time. It lasted more than 2 hours with the LCD on the whole time and with a lot of flash use. I had presupposed that I'd need a second battery, but I am sure I will get tired of shooting before this camera does on any given shoot.<br />I will list my quibbles here in hopes that Sony might see them and rectify them, but they by no means outweigh my extreme satisfaction with this camera.<br />Quibbles:<br />*Needs more white balance presets - For now I use the one-push calibration, but if you don't have a gray card or a sheet of paper handy, more than 2 measly presets would be nice.<br />*AF lock is awkward to use - It works, but not well at all. You have to push a button to lock focus AFTER releasing the shutter button from its halfway down position, and you risk the focus going blurry again (catching it in the middle of its trying to refocus) before you engage the lock button.<br />*Manual is lacking in detail - There is no guide relating recommended apertures to distances for the different settings of the flash. You either use auto mode or you take guesses at the correct f stop. It also doesn't explain what the camera does with the flash in auto mode. I am sure I'll figure all this out with some experimentation, but as a techie I like to know EXACTLY what is going on.<br />*Metering only shows +-2 stops, and doesn't work at all when in aperture or shutter priority mode and the camera deigns that there isn't enough light to get to the desired exposure. It just blinks a light at you.<br />*The 8mb memory stick is a joke. 128mb sticks are now available for [$$$], but this must be factored into the price.","excellent picture quality<br />easy to operate<br />get 64 or 128 MB memory stick to go with it<br />Ideal digital camera for family pictures and travel.","I bought this camera to replace a Kodak DC4800 which had difficulty rendering sharp photos indoors (even with the firmware upgrade).  The Sony is much sharper indoors, with accurate focusing and a strong flash.  The MPEG video feature turns out to be more fun than I thought it would be.  My main criticism is that the camera takes too long to set the focus and exposure before taking the picture -- the moment is often gone by the time the camera acts.  Also, outdoor color isn't as good with the Sony as the Kodak, but it is easily corrected with image-editing software.","I probably spent 2to 3 hours researching my anticipated purchase of a digital camera.  I told myself that I would spend no more than a couple of hundred dollars but the more I looked into it, the more I realized that a decent camera could not be bought for that price.  So I changed my goal to find a camera that had all the features I would need for the least amount of money.  I must have read everything on the net about digital camera's that ever was and I started narrowing down the list to a few names, then finally all roads kept pointing at the DSC S75. So I found a deal and made the leap, fully expecting to be a little disappointed when the camera finally arrived. The camera arrived and I began shooting the same day. Yeah, there was a bit to learn, but the more I learned, the more impressed I got. The quality of the pics are quite amazing. Oh, I also bought the Lexar 128mb stick so I would not have to keep deleting the pics cause I had no more room. I got a fantastic deal here on Amazon on that, even better than you can get on Ebay.  I also bought the HP photosmart 1115 printer and it arrived about 3 days after the camera did.  Anyway, back to the pics.  They came out super good.  Now I am hooked, I just ordered the flash, and now I am checking out the telephoto lense options. Photography many years ago was a big hobby of mine, and I do believe this camera has brought that interest back to life.  This camera has auto settings, aperture priority options as well as shutter priority. This camera has so many cool things to take advantage of that I guess it will be a while till I get proficient with all the possibilities. I wanted to be brief with this review, but with this camera that is difficult. I can just say that I am glad I did my homework, I feel like I got an \"A\" on the exam.  Oh, just thought I pass this one on to you, I read a professional reviewers article on this camera, he that said this camera was probably the best digital camera under the $5000 professional range.  I thought he might be biased, but now I am not so sure.","My wife Cara and I decided to get into the 21st century of Digital Photograpy with our 2001 Christmas present to each other. We are just beginning to \"scratch the surface\" of its seemingly unending capabilities. You can take more photos on a 128 megabite memory stick than you can believe. Choose a format of 600 X 800 and you can fill 2 or 3 LARGE photo albums with your personal images or loved ones. Set it up for an MPEG film clip and record video and audio at once. How about audio with a still, I could go on and on but, suffice it to say that we are 2 very happy Sony Cybershot owners and are still learning about this marvelous world of digital photography.","This is the best camera I have ever bought. I originaly bought it in october last year, to sell things on ebay. I have not put it down since. Its easy to use, no manual required and the results are fabulous. It has a traditional zoom in and out lens, built in flash, a good size lcd screen and is nicely compact. I print out my pics using an HP photosmart 1315 printer with results as good as any 35mm I have had developed.<br />The camera is quick to charge with recharges needed infrequently. The sony memory sticks are [high in price] and I recommemd getting several 32 or 64's if you are using the camera on vacation. You could get by with one memory stick if you have computer access and don't mind emailing the picture's to yourself frequently.","Being a novice photographer, I wanted to upgrade to a quality digicam. (3+ megapixels). I owned an OLYMPUS entry level digicam for  4 years. Basically point and shoot. When this camera broke and OLYMPUS wanted over $... to fix it, ... I new it was time to move away from Olympus and tried several other brands. I decided on the SONY DSC-S75. It has adjustable functions that compare to SLR's (shutter speed, aperture settings,manual exposure, etc,) along with 6x digital zoom. \"Memory Stick\" media is considerably more expensive than \"Smartmedia\", but this was not a problem as I own a Sony VAIO computer and Digital camcorder which both use \"Memory stick\". This is a GREAT camera for anyone who wants to move up from \"point and shoot\" to a more advanced system.","This is my first digital camera.  I did alot of research before I bought this camera.  It was worth it.  The only drawback is not enough memory is included.","After a lengthy review of the available 3 and 4 megapixel cameras, I purchased the Sonty DSC-S75 model. I was looking for an easy to use (translated automatic) camera that my wife could use as well as one that would give me the manual options for more flexibilty. I chose the Sony because it gave me all the options I required as well as supporting Epson's Print Image Matching. I have been thouroughly pleased with my purchase from day one.<br />The photo quality is exceptional as is the ease of use. The controls are fairly well laid out, and the menus easy to navigate. When coupled with my Epson 785EPX printer with the print image matching (PIM) the results are tremendous.<br />I chose the S75 over the S85 because I could discern no significant difference between the test photos on DPreview on the 3.34 and 4.1 MP Sonys for the extra $. I use the Epson software for printing quick photos because of the PIM, and the MGI software included I didn't care for. For serious editing I use Photoshop Elements so the MGI suite was not a consideration. I considered the S-5 because of it's smaller size, but it didn't have the features I wanted. After using the S75, it fits well, the size is a little thick, but it has a solid \"real\" camera feel and the thickness is what gives it a better balance. Don't be fooled by the smaller size cameras, for my medium size hands like mine it doesn't work as the controls and feel are wrong (I have one in that size also).<br />The only negative comments I have on this camera are the tiny memory stick included (get yourself at least a 32 MB memorystick) and that you need to use the Sony flash (but I can't remember that last time I needed an add-on so I probably won't purchase it).","I did an extensive online research before making my final decision to buy Sony S75.  I was considering either Sony S75 or Olympus C-3040.  I am very happy with the camera so far.  S75 has amazing features and so easy to use that I was taking photo ten mins after I opened my box.  The camera has various settings like ISO 100, 200, 400 or auto, different flash levels,different degrees of sharpness and photo quality, different image sizes, different rec modes, indoor or outdoor settings...etc.  The battery is definitely one of the best part about this camera.  It shows you how much time remaining while taking photos and also recharges very fast.  The movie mode is great as well.  With 320x240 image size and 64M memory stick, you can take up to 10 mins of movie which you can play in any winplayer.  The resolution is satisfactory.<br />However, there are still some drawbacks about this camera as well.  The four-way buttom is rather too small to push.  Furthermore, even though S75 produces great photos, I am still not happy with the photo quality it produces.  For serious photographer, you might want to go for other cameras like Olympus or Nikon which will give you sharper images. S75 also does not take good photo when lack of light unless you use manual mode.  Also it is a good idea to buy additional 64MB memory stick while you purchase this camera.  You can get a better deal if you shop around online.<br />Overall, this is still a great camera.  You can enjoy it from the first second you open the box and have so much fun with it without thinking how much you just spend on this camera!","if you need an easy to use, smart camera, and has a great movie mode, this is worth it... I've had so much fun and entertained so many friends with this state of the art digital toy, + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +","I did a lot of research online and read a lot of reviews before I finally decided to buy the Sony DSC-S75 camera. After using the camera for about a month, here are my impressions.<br />Positives:<br />1. Excellent pictures. When printed on a good printer with photographic paper is virtually indistinguishable from film.<br />2. Loads of features. Allows you to customize your shots the way you want. Menus are relatively easy to use.<br />3. Battery life is excellent, gives you an estimated remaining battery life on the camera.<br />Negatives:<br />1. Relatively bulky, there are smaller 3 megapixel cameras out there, but is ergonomically designed and fits well in my hand.<br />2. 8MB memory stick is practically useless, you need to have at least 64MB.<br />3. Slow taking pictures. I don't know if this is a problem with all digital cameras, but there is about a 1 to 2 second delay from the time I press the button to when the picture actually takes. Meanwhile, your subject could be moving and ruin the picture. I've tried taking pictures of my 2 year old and I have to take 10 pictures before I get one good one.<br />Overall, I think this is a very good camera, which takes excellent pictures and could replace my 35mm camera.","After mulling over 10-15 cameras I finally decided on the Sony. Understanding that it uses Memory Stick, I purchased the camera and have been extremely happy and impressed. I give it five stars because FEATURES, PHOTO QUALITY, and EASE OF USE are all top-notch. Even if the storage is proprietary, what else are you going to use SmartMedia or CompactFlash for?<br />You can't go wrong with this Sony.","I was dead set on getting on of the Sony P1s - it was small and took high quality pictures. Sadly, the store had run out, but an enterprising showroom assistant suggested checking out the DCS-75 instead. I'm so glad I did! This camera is amazing. I've never owned a digital camera before - and wonder why I waited so long now. 3.3 Megapixels is probably more than enough for most people - for snapshots I have the setting down to 640 x 480 and don't go much above 1280 x 960 for anything.  However, should you want to, the camera can take 2048 x 1536 and can save in a variety of formats, including .TIFF. It will even take movies of up to about 1 minute, although the quality of the movies is not fabulous. There are some standard special effects settings too (if you don't trust youself with Photoshop or the like)such as black & white and negative. The menu system is easy to understand although I'd recommend having a quick look through the instruction booklet to find out about all the extras. I found it easy to find my way round the camera after only one reading. The camera has a nice chunky feel - like and old school 35mm - and the handgrip feels good and secure. The LCD is a sensible size at about 1.5 inches (although like all LCDs is hard to see in very bright light)and combined with the viewfinder makes it very easy to focus and frame in just about any light. An adjustable LCD would have been even better, but there you are. The only thing that I found wrong with this camera was the piddly little 8mb Memory Stick. I would strongly reccomend getting a 32 or 64 Mb, as the 8 meg will fill up in about 10 shots if you go for size and quality. Also - some sort of protective covering offered with the camera would be nice: I bought the semi-hard carrying case for it after dropping on a corner and denting the aluminium casing... What more can I say - a fabulous camera.","This camera is just incredible!  There are so many picture options, The battery lasts forever, It is an ergonomic excellence, and most of all the pictures are incredible.  I am having a great time using this camera shooting life (My children).  I only wish the Memory sticks where larger in capacity.  Looks like Sony has plans for bigger than 128mb in the future.  I have 2 64mb Memory sticks and that is the minimum you need for this camera.  I would like to get a few more as the prices drop (which they are).  ENJOY!","I had used to camera for past three weeks and had shot over 1000 pictures all over the attractions in my country,and i must said that this is a very user friendly camera.at first use it really is complicated with its white balance setting.auto or maual.iso setting .aperture or shutter speed setting...But after a few time of outdoor shooting I must said it is the best camera I had used so far.it will probably not be out run for the next three years.And the print out from my HP printer using matt hard paper from Epson And Hp are both brilliant and sharp indisguinable from film shot photo.one bad point i can complained that just only three weeks of usage.the printed icon on the jog dial on top right of the camera is falling off.some printed on my finger.I'm going to send for repair,wander how many user had this problem.","Excellent camera! Battery life is great and you have a count down in minutes for the battery life. Image is superb. Interface is also easy to use and compared to Nikon and Olympus, much more straight forward. Using the 128mb memory stick will give you over 700 photos on low resolution, which usually is the one you want to use anyway for email a friend, etc. The Sony site ImageStation will let you store albums for free and you can have any photo printed right there (paid service of course). Much better built than Olympus.","I love this camera!  The images print out very nicely just on my Epson Stylus Color 880!!  I cannot believe the quality of the pictures.<br />Watch out for # of pixels.  If you want to print out a 4X6 pic, choose 2048 3X2 instead of 2048X1536.  But, If you want to use an image as wallpaper of screensaver, then choose 2048X1536.  Adjust photo size in PhotoSuite 8.1, which came with the camera.  The printed images look just like photos real picture quality - not pixelated with kodak premium picture paper for inkjet printers.<br />All my friends are amazed at the quality and cannot beleive the pictures are printed.  I take pictures and then print them out immediately if I want.<br />The camera has all the settings I need, including manual overrides (which I never use) and motion picture with sound recordable and speaker, so I can play the movie clip back and hear it too.  I make a lot of use of the close up portrait configuration (excellent detail close and blurring the background, as well as landscape (no blurring of the background) and twilight configurations.<br />You absolutely need to buy a 64MB or higher memory stick - plan on that as an expense.  These memory sticks aren't cheap!  The [money] I saved buying this camera on sale went straight into memory sticks and camera bag.","What can I say? I really like this camera! I'm a 35mm photo-hobbiest that previously owned/used a Mavica FD-81, and was looking for something that was smaller, faster, and took cleaner pictures. I originally was looking at the S50, but with that model on it's way out (being replaced by the S55 possibly, depending on sales of the P50...I'm told), I looked into (and bought) this model.<br />This camera may actually begin to replace my 35mm. First off, the camera's lens takes some excellent pictures: clarity, color, etc. Combined with the tons of manual override features, it gives me the visual control I found lacking in other models (you can even disable the digital zoom altogether, a big feature for me). And the LCD capabilities also stand out against the competitors: (1) you don't have to use it (a view window is provided, which is centered to the lens...so you really get what you see) and this almost triples your battery life, and (2) LCD image review allows you to zoom in/out of pictures to verify that you got the details you were looking for. Expansion speaking, Sony uses the memory stick technology in their cameras (I can share my 64 MB sticks between my mp3 player and this), it has a slot to attach a more professional model flash, and the camera lens supports add-ons. As well, the speed is phenominal - it takes the pictures quick...and you don't have to half-press the button to focus before you take the pic...just press once and it'll auto-focus and take the picture on it's own.<br />There are only two real downsides of note to the S75: (1) size and (2) ease of image distribution. There are a lot of cameras out there that are both smaller and lighter; however, I found this model to have the same size and feel as my Nikon 35mm, so that didn't bother me. As well, I miss being able to use the straight-to-disk feature of the Mavica. Also, beware - out of the box it's set to 2048x1536 fine (which will blow up to poster-size without pixilating, BTW) - which will eat up the 8MB stick in about 5 pics...reducing it down to 1280x960 let me fit a lot more before I upgraded my memory stick.<br />If size and weight is your ultimate selling point, take a look at the P1 or the P50; but if you want the pictures and the control of a real 35mm, this is definitely the camera for you.","the MGI software 8.1 is unable to get pictures from the camera to the software without making a folder and copying files to the folder.  the mgi 8.1 needs a full sheet of photo paper to print a wallet size photo.","The Sony DSC-S75 brings digital photography one step closer to the output one acheives with a 35mm camera.<br />The unit fits perfectly in ones hand and is ergonomically well designed. It has an in-camera recharable battery that gives you an amazing amount of shooting power over time. The Carl Zeiss lens yields some of the sharpest prints I have ever seen produced by a digital camera.  Even 8x10s  look gorgeous when shot in the fine mode.<br />The camera has all the bells and whistles that allow the photographer different degrees of control over the image.  Shutter priority, aperture priority, manual overide and digital zoom are but a few.  The macro mode allows you to get extremely close to an object with fantastic results.<br />On the negative side, Sony embarasses itself when it ships this item with only an 8 mb memory stick.  You must factor in the price of a 32mb stick into your budget.  I loved the camera so much that I splurged on a 128mb stick and now I can shoot until my finger gets sore!<br />This aside, I highly recommend this beautifully engineered piece of equipment.  I am beginning to reconsider my reliance on the 35 mm camera."]},{"name":"Nikon D1X","amazon_reviews":["16 year old camera performs like the day it was made. EXCELLENT camera.

PCworld.com's recommendation was based on excellent battery life and above average picture quality. While the article mentioned a fews \"cons\" with the camera, it did neglect to mention that the zoom operation was sluggish and jumpy (not smooth), and actually locked up after 3 weeks of usage. I had to turn the camera off and back on to enable the zoom operation again. The picture quality was very good (for a novice photographer like me), except when I wasn't absolutely still while pressing the shutter button (pictures turned out blurry). I'm not sure if this is normal with all digital cameras. However, this is the main reason why I wanted a digital camera in the first place--so that I can easily discard unwanted pictures without the hassle of developing them. It is however still irritating to find that the pictures you have just taken are completely unusable.<br />A few other cons that PCWorld.com mentioned were that the zoom lens partially obstructed the viewfinder and difficulty in opening and closing battery compartment. Although minor annoyances, they were hardly reasons for disliking the camera.<br />As to battery life, the set of rechargeable NiMh lasts for about 200-300 shots. That is far better than most digital cameras on the market.<br />In summary, I feel that the camera is probably just an average deal for the price. I don't think that PCWorld.com did as thorough a review on the Toshiba PDRM61 as they did on the other ones in the article.  It seemed that the reviews on the other cameras provided more information that I could have used. Anyhow, I will be exchanging the camera to the store for either a CANON A20 or Nikon E775. I believe that either one is a better product than the Toshiba.","This is my first digital camera.  I bought it because it got excellent reviews in both Consumer Reports and PC World.

While the article mentioned a fews \"cons\" with the camera, it did neglect to mention that the zoom operation was sluggish and jumpy (not smooth), and actually locked up after 3 weeks of usage. I had to turn the camera off and back on to enable the zoom operation again. The picture quality was very good (for a novice photographer like me), except when I wasn't absolutely still while pressing the shutter button (pictures turned out blurry). I'm not sure if this is normal with all digital cameras. However, this is the main reason why I wanted a digital camera in the first place--so that I can easily discard unwanted pictures without the hassle of developing them. It is however still irritating to find that the pictures you have just taken are completely unusable.<br />A few other cons that PCWorld.com mentioned were that the zoom lens partially obstructed the viewfinder and difficulty in opening and closing battery compartment. Although minor annoyances, they were hardly reasons for disliking the camera.<br />As to battery life, the set of rechargeable NiMh lasts for about 200-300 shots. That is far better than most digital cameras on the market.<br />In summary, I feel that the camera is probably just an average deal for the price. I don't think that PCWorld.com did as thorough a review on the Toshiba PDRM61 as they did on the other ones in the article.  It seemed that the reviews on the other cameras provided more information that I could have used. Anyhow, I will be exchanging the camera to the store for either a CANON A20 or Nikon E775. I believe that either one is a better product than the Toshiba.","This is my first digital camera.  I bought it because it got excellent reviews in both Consumer Reports and PC World.  It takes wonderful pictures, and it is so easy to use!!!  The day I bought it, I was able to take photos, load them on my computer, edit them and email them within a couple of hours.... and I am NOT a computer techie.  The batteries last and last, the emailing lets me illustrate my letters, and I have had not one problem since I got it.  All my friends with digital cameras told me horror stories about inability to get the pix from camera to computer, software malfunctions, battery failures, etc.  Not with this camera!  I really love my Toshiba and I am having so much fun with it.  I highly recommend it.","I purchased this TOshiba digital camera because Consumer Reports rated it number one for photo quality in its class of 2.0 - 2.9 megapixels. While I am not a professional photographer, my film needs would never exceed photo quality of a higher caliber, and I am immensely pleased with this product. The design of the camera is not wholly ideal to me, but the photo quality is superb, and that is what matters most to me."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix 2300","amazon_reviews":["This was our families first digital camera we bought in 2001.

Sure, you could spend a lot more for a camera that is a lot more high-tech, but if you just want a camera to learn on and experiment with or just take fun family snaps, then this camera would be great.<br />My husband actually won a photo contest with a 5x7 photo taken on an older model of this camera (printed on an HP printer).<br />Pros: low cost, easy to use, easy to figure out how to take good photos, takes good enough quality photos to replace your film camera (if you're ready for that... I'm not quite there).<br />Cons: memory card pretty small if you want to take high quality pics (We got a bigger memory card--available on costco.com--so we could take many pictures at high quality settings.), slow upload to your computer using serial cable (we got a SmartMedia drive that hooks up to our USB port and is lightning quick), lower picture quality capability than many (more expensive) cameras on the market, and batteries are used up fairly quickly IF (and only if) you use the display mode to take pictures with (but this isn't necessary at all for good pictures).<br />These days, most digital cameras really aren't that horrible , and this camera is lightyears better than the super-spendy cameras that were out three years ago. This camera would be great for someone who wants a camera for casual use, or for pictures for their website, or even regular pictures that won't be blown up much larger than 5x7.<br />We take pictures with abandon now, not worrying about how much film we have left, not worrying if a shot is going to be a throw-away (you can delete it right on the camera, anyway), and we have gotten some truly beautiful and priceless shots just using this camera.<br />If you're not a professional photographer, why spend thousands when you can get this camera at a great price?","I purchased this camera for my wife while in Miami on a business trip.  The cost was reasonable and the addition 64Meg.smart media card was an additional bonus included in overall price.  Before reading any instructions, I was able to take this camera right from the box and use...a great feature for men.  Now that I'm back home and have time to review the manaul I find that this camera has more than just pretty looks.  The one draw back if any that really bothers me is the battery life. This camera seems to consume the batteries in big gulps.  Since I'm not an expert with using camera's I have not fully explored all the benifits of this camera yet.  Aside from the huge gulps of power that is comsumed, I find this camera very handy especially when uplaoding the pictures on to the computer.  That was a breeze.<br />This ia good buy overall if you look at price vs. features. Compare that with other similar cameras and your money will be well spent.","I shopped 'til I dropped for an inexpensive 2.3 megapixel camera<br />balancing cost to features and settled on this one. I was not disappointed.  The good first, accurate fleshtones,ease of use,choice of resolutions, flash otions (low light,delayed,etc.) and lighting types (incandescent compensation,flourescent etc.),viewfinder/lcd ability,self-timer,and close-up option.<br />  The whines: no optical zoom (at this price I was not all that concerned only used for scenery shots), the ready led is too close to the viewfinder (blinding in low light),have to switch the batteries quick or lose day/date.<br />Not alot of complaints considering the price of other comparable nodels (kodak ~same price but with less resolution options),canon, olympus, nikon, hp, etc. all of which were pricey by comparison (...), I took this camera on vacation and got good use including taking some total darkness shots with the delayed flash which lit the subjects beautifully, the resolution allows for prints which are photo/framing grade with no real adjustment. The optical zoom would have been useful for subjects which were more than 50 yds. away but you can zoom in your software and get close without sacrificing the quality up to that point.<br />Overall a great buy for the price.<br />Gordon","I had never used a digital camera before the finepix 2300, but certainly now that I have more experience with this kind of gadgets, I am certain that this was the best entry point. The 2300 is an excelent point-and-shot camera, with practically no problems whatsoever. Finepix's software and image downloading is very easy to install and use even to some very old computer models using WIN 98.<br />Even though I have two other more sophisticated digital cameras, I still carry my 2300 everywhere I go, and use it as a side camera. I have never noticed the \"spots\" somebody else complains about, and certainly one thing that I like to stress is that the guys at Fujifilm really did their homework well, since the camera has a great color sensitivity. I have taken lots of colorful pictures in all kind of situations and the only complain I have is that sometimes the flash is too weak if you are shooting outside.<br />This camera is so easy to handle that even children can use it. Even if the lenses are very small, the quality of the images are as good as the more expensive Nikon 775, and certainly the color is far better. It is not heavy at all and the monitor is brigth and sharp. I use mine with two 32 Mb Smartmedia Card and I never get out of memory.<br />I got my camera for a very low price, and certainly, if you do not want all the bells and wistles of more expensive and complicated cameras, try this one. It is worth every penny you pay.","This camera for the person who want variety in picture quality, for either use on the internet, or printing pictures. The resolution is great, even on the lowest resolution setting, I get beautiful prints.The only complaint I do have is that this camera EATS batteries, so when able I recommend using an adapter to plug in for when you are downloading images to your computer to save on battery life. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.","For it's price, this camera has managed to strike a balance between quality and affordability.  2.11 M pixels is good enough for any amateur, who's not fixated on getting the most pixels possible from today's technologies.  The box comes with every thing that one needs to snap away and load JPG files into the PC.<br />Using the camera is pretty easy and intuitive - although I'm a first time user, it just took me about 5 mins to learn the basic functions.  FinePix 2300 is also relatively smaller and more esthetically pleasing to the eye in comparison with other models of its class.  It's slim and smooth lines fits nicely into the palm of your hands.  One does not need to hesitate when wondering \"to bring or not to bring\" a camera to events/places. I suspect that this little beauty will be going to lots of places with me in the future !!<br />I'd recommend this anyone seeking an entry-intermediate level digital camera.","My hushband bought me this camera for my birthday and its great. At first we had trouble with the batteries running out too fast, but we bought some better rechargable batteries, and haven't had any problems since. I've had bad experiences with some cheaper digital cameras, that only have 1 pixel. The pictures were came out really blurry on the computer, and werent even worth printing. It's worth the extra money for the 2.1 pixels!!! I take this camera with me everwhere...I highly recomend it!!!","I received my camera in Aug and used it for a vacation.  I thought the pictures that it took were outstanding and the quality was great. This weekend I went to use the camera and tried to flip it on only nothing happened.  I put a fresh bunch of batteries in and still it didn't work.  Luckily the warranty is still in place and I hope to have a replacement soon.","After researching...for various digital cameras..., I decided to go for this fuji finepix 2300. While your excitement will certainly vary according to the price you pay, I reccommend it highly! The size is small enough to fit into one of my tiny purses and yet offers all the accomodations I was looking for:<br />-built-in flash<br />-variable resolution (great quality photos)<br />-red-eye reduction<br />-self-timer<br />-nice aesthetics<br />-lcd view<br />-usb download port (very fast)<br />-some memory included (only 8 mb but good for backup)<br />-accepts rechargeable AA NIMH batteries -clear up close and distance photos<br />-good color<br />-snap and shoot capabilities<br />Now let me elaborate on the pros and cons...<br />The only real draw backs to this camera remain 1)the somewhat exposed lens and lack of available lens cap and 2)that a zoom lens is not included. One may remedy these slights by simply taking care to protect the lens and adjusting one's distance to the subject accordingly...<br />Other than that, the camera rocks! I've had great photos and none of the problems I've read reviewers have with other cameras. I'm able to take approximately 40 highest resolution images on a 32 mb card and many, many more on lower resolution which is still pretty clear. The set up is easy...all you do is install the software from a cd-rom, turn on the camera, plug in the usb cord, choose the location where you want the pics on your hard drive using the software (very simple), and the images download in a few seconds (of course it'll take longer if you have a larger memory card and more stored images). It comes with Photo Deluxe so you can alter images if you like (brightness/contrast or size, etc). One of the greatest features of this camera is that it takes rechargeable NIMH (better for the environment, bank account, and busy schedules) AA batteries. I've read about other digital cameras tearing through batteries, but I haven't had this problem--my rechargeable NIMH batteries made it through a couple of weeks. You also have the option of turning off the lcd view to save energy. What's more, some cameras require that you use the manufacturers battery, which is a problem if you need to recharge in the rainforest. With this camera, you can just pop in some new AA batteries (4) and continue with your photo spree. The continuous photo option is fun--it takes up to 9 photos and can be put on self-timer.<br />The close up option works great--I tested it with some tropical flowers and natural light. If you don't have a good printer or want to blow-up shots, you can send the photos to a printer.<br />All my friends and family have been highly impressed with the quality of the photos I've emailed them, and it makes for great fun at a party since you can see all the pics immediately!...and delete the one of yourself with your eyes closed...","I cannot believe the photo quality this camera produces. The color and detail is perfect. I am having a lot of fun with this camera. I will definetly buy another Fuji camera. I will get one with zoom next time.","Nice photos for a very good price, a big bargain for a 2,1 Mpixel camara  -  Some troubles with the lens that can easy to get grooves. This is a very reliable equipment with fast and close-up captures.","This digital novice researched & narrowed the field between the HP Photosmart & this one (in my price range). I was told the time for reset between shots is longer in the HP, so I got this one. Easy to use, good results in just a week! Photos came out great, uploading to my iMac is a snap. Get a large memory card so there's no worry about not being able to take the photo you want--64mg holds alot!  The most fun I've ever had with a camera! Caveat: Realize the added expense of necessary accessories--extra memory card, rechargeable batteries & charger; I also purchased an extended service agreement. Also, this does not have an optical zoom. Lastly, I've read that camera makers are going more with cameras using the Compactflash card rather than the Smartmedia card, which this uses, so Smartmedia may be on its way out--but I'm not sure about this.","Perfect!  Thats the best way to describe this camera.  Like most adults I know I was technologically impaired so to speak.  Then I got this as a gift.  This is a fact, i didn't use my old camera again.  This thing is amazing.  It isn't to high tech, nor is it to pricy.  This camera has only 2 drawbacks, and one of those can be fixed.  The first is that although it seems light, once you put in the smartmedia card and the 4 AA batteries it becomes quite heavy.  The other drawback is that if you regular baatteries it will finsh them before you know it.  But that can be fixed easily by buying rechargable batteries.  Other than that this camera is great.  It changed the way i took pictures forever.  And it is very first-timer friendly.  All in all buy this camera, it doesn't get much better than this!!","Before reading my review think that if you buy this camera you will spend less than $300.-<br />Picture quality is the best you can get for this price. My rating for the pictures at 1600 Fine Resolution is excellent. Printings with HP 930 look great, forget about dropping the films at the photo-lab. If you are looking for better quality pictures you should think of another price range cameras like Olympus E-10 or Canon D30, which means that you will pay between 6 and 15 times the price of this camera. For family, home, vacation and hobby pictures don't waste your money in similar and much more expensive products.<br />First try digital pictures with this camera, it is an excellent starting point.","Overall, I am happy with the quality and ease of use with this camera.  Features are easy to learn/use.  Quality of most pictures is very good.  USB cable makes downloading a breeze.  I am looking at my pictures in 30 seconds. I also like the wide range of print quality you can chose from which offers flexibility.<br />The 8MB card included is not bad for just starting out.  If you only want pics to email or show on a computer screen, you can fit quite a lot on this little card.  If you want print quality though, pick up a 32 or 64MB card and save yourself the hassle.<br />Negatives:  I got this camera because it has a macro lens (close ups) - a feature hard to find on an inexpensive camera.  While the macro feature produces OK close-ups, they are still pretty poor when compared to to macro shots with a traditional camera.  Still good in a pinch though or when you don't need perfection.<br />This camera EATS batteries.  I am not getting even HALF to the number of shots for the battery life according to the manual so I am debating whether the camera is defective. The cost of batteries could quickly offset any savings on film and processing.  I may have to invest in rechargeables.","I was very impressed with the image quality of the Fuji FinePix 2300 Digital Camera as it came direct to my doorstop. Images were crisp and clear and the macro function created some beautiful close-up shots. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to get started taking pictures and slowly adjust settings as one becomes more familiar with the camera. Quite possibly the best digital camera you can buy for \"the money\"!","I bought this camera a few days ago expecting to get what I payed for, a 2.1 mega pixel, mid-range digital camera.  As far as picture quality it has surpassed the quality I thought I was getting.  As long as you use the Normal or Fine quality picture modes in the 1600x1200 resolution the prints of the pictures were almost as clear as a non digital camera.  In fact if I would have printed it on glossy photo paper, I probably would not have been able to tell much of a difference between that print out and a non digital camera's print out.  I even printed some pictures the size of a whole page and it was still pretty good quality.  This camera is simple to use, by the end of the first day I knew how to use almost all the features of the camera.  Every camera has its downsides, however, and this camera is no exception.  One downside is that the viewfinder is right above the LCD screen.  This makes it hard to look through the viewfinder without putting a smudge on the LCD screen.  Another small complaint I had was that the camera lens appears to be very vulnerable to scratches since it isn't protected very well by the rest of the camera.  As long as you keep it in a nice case and handle it with care you should have no problem with the lens though, and you can use the LCD screen to take pictures without ever using the viewfinder.  This camera can be set to automatic mode where the camera decides the type of flash, white mode, and brightness for you, or as you become advanced with digital cameras you can set the camera to manual mode and make all the choices for yourself.  This allows your camera to grow with you.  I mainly use the auto mode, since the camera does a pretty good job of adjusting the flash and other features on its own.  This camera usually comes with a 8 MB smart media card for storing the pictures in the camera.  This card can hold only 10 pictures in the camera's fine 1600x1200 mode.  (the best camera mode) It can, however, hold 19 pictures in the normal mode, which I have found to be a good mode for most pictures.  This is not a lot of pictures so I would advise purchasing at least one more 8 MG card, or even a 16 MG card. (the 16 MG card can hold 20 pictures in the best mode and 39 in the normal mode)  These cards are very easily taken in and out of the camera, and the camera comes with a USB cable to easily transfer pictures from the camera to the computer when the smart media card is in the camera.  This saves you from having to purchase expensive smart media card readers, which adds to the bargain of buying this camera.  Make sure you have a USB port on your computer to be sure you can use this cable. In conclusion this camera is a bargain for a 2 mega pixel camera, and takes very high quality pictures. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera under ... who still wants good quality photos.","I'm new to the world of digital cameras and was impressed with how easily the FUJIFILM FinePix 2300 images could be manipulated. Brightness levels can be adjusted after the pictures have been taken. The zoom and panning feature alow images to be cropped for aesthetically better compositions. I am impressed with the quality of the macro photo funtion. Reviewing images on the display makes it easy to delete bad pics. But, I do have one big complaint. The lens quality distorts images. I intended to use this camera to document painted portraits and other artwork, however, the distortion is too significant.  You can spot this by taking a picture of a round plate holding the camera vertically and then again with the camera held horizontally. A distortion can be seen with the round circle appearing slightly elongated one direction and compressed in the other.<br />I will run this test on any future camera I buy and am considering returning the camera even though I am impressed with the ease of its use.","The FujiFilm FinePix 2300 is an all-around great value if you're looking for a high-resolution, 2.1 megapixel CCD 1600x1200 max digital camera.  The 5.8mm (36mm equivalent) focus is excellent; you get a sharp, detailed image, even in 640x480 low-resolution.  The 2.5X digital zoom is only functional in low-resolution mode (640x480) but this camera takes really nice pictures even in low-resolution.  The 8MB SmartMedia card can store up to 89 images at 640x480.  If you invest in a 128MB SmartMedia card, you can store 1,330 images at 640x480 (or 166 images at 1600x1200 fine resolution).  Overall, it's a really easy-to-use camera.  I took it out on many trips so far and I find it very responsive and able to take sharp pictures on-the-fly, even while in the car moving 80+ miles-per-hour.  The FujiFilm software to upload your images through the camera's USB interface is quick and easy.  The price is right too!","I got this camera about a month back when it just got released. Actually I was intending to get the 1300 model but decided to pay a little more and get the newer 2300 model. I've compared with all other cameras around and must say this is one of the best deal you can get. It is very small, light & compact, fits easily into a coat pocket. The 4 AA batteries that it uses lasts a long time and with functions like self-timer, 5 modes of flash, red eye reduction, tripod mountable, macro mode, digital 2x zoom, USB connections. Pictures taken during the day are very clear & good, for night shorts or where places are dark, a steady hand is required.<br />The only few disadvantages that I can think of is the camera lens can be scratch easily. (If you look at the picture of the camera you'll know what I mean). The other is if you gripped the camera tightly with your hand you can feel some kind of plastic sound, as if the body of the camera is not tightly screwed. The camera doesn't come with a case, so it's advisable to get one, especially with its unprotected lens.<br />All in all, I'll give a all thumbs up for this model, Fuji Finepix 2300!","This is a very easy to use camera ideally suited for newcomers to digital photography. This is probably the cheapest 2.1 megapixel camera in the market at the moment. But be prepared to compromise on quality. Pictures are of acceptable quality in good daylight but absolutely horrible in low lit surroundings. The auto focus doesnt work that well either.<br />I returned mine after two weeks. My recommendation: Go get a Canaon A20 instead.","I just bought a Fuji digital camera, Model 2300 and I love it!  It's absolutely user friendly and easy to use. It's my first digital camera and I'm thrilled that I don't ever have to buy film again and wait for processing.  I am still very new to this way of taking photos, but so far, it's so so easy to get quality photos and quickly.  I can delete, edit, save, e-mail, enlarge and enhance all on-line.  It's one of the coolest ways to have memories saved forever.  Plus, this little camera was very reasonable in price and fits into my pocket or purse."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot Pro90 IS","amazon_reviews":["This is one great professional grade camera.

My last digital camera was the Canon S10 which I love for its' portablility and macro function. This is a camera that you can carry around in your handbag at all times. It only has a 2X zoom which is frustrating when you want to take photos from a distance. I had invested in a 340MB Microdrive so when I started looking for a new camera, my criteria was a camera that had a great zoom feature and had a compatible Compact II flash slot. The Canon Pro 90 IS fit the bill perfectly. I did a lot of research and based on my criteria and the experience of previously owning a Canon,I chose the Pro 90 and I have not been disappointed. It takes really beautiful pictures and the zoom is terrific. The only drawback is that it does not have a macro feature for close ups. You can buy a macro lens and that will probably be my next expenditure. I print my photos on an HP 990cxi using HP photo glossy paper and I swear they look better than 35mm prints from a print shop. The ability to take 30 sec video is an additional plus. This is a terrific camera!","This is my first Digital Camera purchase and it took me a lot of time to read enough reviews to make the decision to purchase this Canon Pro 90. I have to say that it is an amazing camera overall. The 10x zoom is so much better than any 3x zoom on other digital cameras. I got back from snowboarding in Whistler (Canada) and looked at some pictures I took of my girlfriend with a conventional camera and you could barely notice that it was her against the white snow covered mountain. That is when I decided that I needed a camera with a decent zoom. And this 10x zoom is perfect for those far away shots. My only complaint about this camera is its size. This camera comes with a neck strap which is nice but for taking with you every where you go, you might want to think about a smaller camera. Other than the size this camera is wonderful for the average person like me who knows nothing about aperature settings etc. although I am learning now since this camera also allows you to take it out of auto mode and manually adjust all the settings you would want to.","I bought it 11 june 2001 and by 12 june it was as if I have owned this camera all my life. No regrets!","I am a great fan of this camera.  I've used point-and-shoot 35mm cameras for years, always being intimidated by the jump in expertise needed for a \"real\" SLR camera where all the decisions were not automated.  After a trip to Alaska, I was intensely disappointed with my pictures from the point-and-shoot.  Most wildlife photos were of the \"See that brown dot? It's a moose!\" variety, and many of my photos on snow or glaciers were overwhelmed by all the brilliant white in the image.  I'd always told myself I'd one day go digital, but always thought the technology wasn't \"ready\".  When I returned from Alaska, and saw this camera, I decided the technology was ready, or at least I was! I was initially attracted by the 10x zoom, and was further impressed by the image stabilization, and the ability to go \"full auto\" on all the technical settings, yet ease myself into setting such things as f/stop, white balance, and shutter speed myself.  The camera has fulfilled all my expectations. It takes fine pictures in most circumstances if you let the camera make all the decisions, but you have the ability to experiment with manual settings yourself, and the quick availability of the digital image means you can learn faster, and without having to wince over paying for film and developing.  I bought the camera only a few days before leaving on a trip to Florida, focusing on the Everglades.  I got some excellent photos using the telephoto lens, and the image stabilization made using the maximum zoom easy, even with handheld shots.  I used automatic settings almost exclusively for the Everglades trip, but now am practicing and experimenting with the manual settings. I have a few minor quibbles, though they do not detract from my positive feelings for the camera:  1) The camera is a bit slow--If you want to spend most of your time taking pics of athletic events or similar places where \"split second\" photography is needed, it may not be a good choice.  It has a maximum frame rate of about 1.5 seconds per shot.  2) The battery life is workable, though I did need to shell out for a second battery (about $75, though they are rechargable).  One reason for this is because I chose to use the camera with IBM Microdrives, which have a huge photo capacity, but put more drain on the battery. 3) The camera is certainly less convenient than a point and shoot to carry around, but compared to a 35mm SLR with a 370 mm lens, it is VERY easy.  I doubt I'd even notice this if I wasn't used to sticking my teeny Olympus point-and-shoot in my front pocket and forgetting about it!  If you use any digital camera while travelling, I suggest you consider getting the Iomega Fotoshow to store your pictures and free up your memory cards for more shooting.  It also makes a convenient way to review and show off your pictures on a television set. 4)  The price is a bit stiff, but if you want a camera of this class, you are going to have to bite your lip and pay up!","this is a follow up to my pervous review. that review was written a week after I got my camera, now im up to 4000 photos (accourding to the image file naming system) I have to make a few corrections. the overexposing flash problem can be fixed by reducing the flash power, yes you can change it for 10 increments from -2 to 2. althought for macrophotoggraphy the flash is blocked by the cameras own cannon style lens for subjects a close at 10 cm. the min macro focus is 7cm at widest angle, after you zoon in to 10x the min focus becomes 70cm, which is hardly considered macrophotography. I have yet to find the perfect balence between the two. I still cannot stand the 2.8 aperature. its hardly enough to take anything, indoors, the autometering sytem often give 1/15 of a second, compared to my olympus 2020's 1/30 or 35 (at F = 2.0) even with image stablization, 1/13 hardly gets you a sharp image, you are forced to use flash. and yes the ccd has a bit of noise even at iso 100 in low light situations, a lot more compared to my olympus 2020 or figu finepix 401 ccd. it has a nice iso 50 ccd sensitivity level, which yeilds great color saturation at longer exposures, and reduces ccd noise. a great feature for dawn or dusk photography with a tripod. at 10x optical zoom 2x digital zoom, bird photography quality is acceptable for 3x5 prints(equiv to 740mm in 35mm scale). GET AN EXTRA BATTERY, ALWAYS. this camera does not come with a case in Taiwan, but im sure it does in the US, as I saw it on the catalog. I had to buy my own. the 37mm not wide at all angle still bugs me,  I would go for a wide angle converter, although I hear that pushes barallel distortion to the limit.<br />this camera is all the professional stuff packed in a small package, the pros are worth its trade offs.","Good camera, the telephoto at 10x is amazing when the image stablization is on. pretty much all the zoom you could ever need. the image quality is supreme, at medium compression at 1024 the average file size is around 300k, great pictures, although bad for posting online due to the large file size. the flash is ultra strong, resulting in overexposures in any macro zoom or anything less than 70cm. bad. in low light situations, the autofocus is very very slow, sometimes it cant focus at all.it has a cute flashlight feature for focusing, but it doesnt do much good when subjects are far. one other thing, teh aperature is really bad at 2.8 a 1/4 of a second exposure even with image stablization requires a very steady hand and a stationary subject. at ISO 400 there is a lot of CCD noise in low light situations. also, the wide angle at 37mm was a real disappointment, but for what it is, the Canon Pro90Is is just awesome. the LCD looks great, and the Eletronic viewfinder serves all practical purposes. its many auto metering modes are good, in portrait mode, aperature is set to a maximum for background blur with least depth of focus. the night scene mode is good, flash at a 1 second exposure, to collect light from close unlit subjects as well as far dimly lit backgrounds. the battery is great, lasting almost 2 times as long as 4 NiMh 1600mAh batteries on my Olympus C2020. but get an extra battery on field trips. 1 battery will last about a day in electronic viewfinder mode, the LCD just kills. one thing about the huge lens, GET A LENS PORTECTOR. the lens collects ocean wave mist, dirt, dust, ugh. one good thing about it, it is compatible with all standard 58mm add on lenses, as well as any Canon Add-on Flash. it is a bit heave wighting in at 680 grams, but with telephoto is well worth the trade off. all the settings can be accessed through buttons, not in an electronic menu, which saves time, your left hand can control flash modes, auto metering modes while your right hand releases the shutter. there is a bit of lag between pictures, which is kind of disappointing, but I can live with it. the electronic viewfinder has lag, so its hard to take pictures of fast moving subjects such as birds or roller coasters. the power on takes a while, it insists on putting the lens in an \"off posititon\" so when you power on it takes time to move back, I dont see the point, since its all internal, and wastes 3 seconds of precious time.<br />overall : good camera, exceeds my expectations. the lens is a work of art, the interface is cute, the processing power needs a bit of work, but very good for the price range. I got this camera 3 days ago.","Good camera, the telephoto at 10x is amazing when the image stablization is on. pretty much all the zoom you could ever need. the image quality is supreme, at medium compression at 1024 the average file size is around 300k, great pictures, although bad for posting online due to the large file size. the flash is ultra strong, resulting in overexposures in any macro zoom or anything less than 70cm. bad. in low light situations, the autofocus is very very slow, sometimes it cant focus at all.it has a cute flashlight feature for focusing, but it doesnt do much good when subjects are far. one other thing, teh aperature is really bad at 2.8 a 1/4 of a second exposure even with image stablization requires a very steady hand and a stationary subject. at ISO 400 there is a lot of CCD noise in low light situations. also, the wide angle at 37mm was a real disappointment, but for what it is, the Canon Pro90Is is just awesome. the LCD looks great, and the Eletronic viewfinder serves all practical purposes. its many auto metering modes are good, in portrait mode, aperature is set to a maximum for background blur with least depth of focus. the night scene mode is good, flash at a 1 second exposure, to collect light from close unlit subjects as well as far dimly lit backgrounds. the battery is great, lasting almost 2 times as long as 4 NiMh 1600mAh batteries on my Olympus C2020. but get an extra battery on field trips. 1 battery will last about a day in electronic viewfinder mode, the LCD just kills. one thing about the huge lens, GET A LENS PORTECTOR. the lens collects ocean wave mist, dirt, dust, ugh. one good thing about it, it is compatible with all standard 58mm add on lenses, as well as any Canon Add-on Flash. it is a bit heave wighting in at 680 grams, but with telephoto is well worth the trade off. all the settings can be accessed through buttons, not in an electronic menu, which saves time, your left hand can control flash modes, auto metering modes while your right hand releases the shutter. there is a bit of lag between pictures, which is kind of disappointing, but I can live with it. the electronic viewfinder has lag, so its hard to take pictures of fast moving subjects such as birds or roller coasters.<br />overall : good camera, exceeds my expectations. the lens is a work of art, the interface is cute, the processing power needs a bit of work, but very good for the price range","I couldn't wait for the powershot 90 to arrive, and when it did, I was delighted.  This camera has everything: A beaultiful 10X optical lens for wildlife shots, a ELT viewfinder, which is actualy much better than the Pro 90's closest competitor --the Olympus 2100z.  The Olympus' ELT viewfinder displayed similar information as the Powershot 90, but the actuall display of the 2100 was distored and not very enjoyable to see through.  I feared Canon's display would be just as distored, but when I first gazed into the comfortable eye slot of the Powershot 90, my fears disappeared...the image that the viewfinder displayed was crystal clear, a thing of beauty.  It was a perfect replica of the LCD dispaly with all the settings, like WB, aperture, shutter speed, flash, etc.  No longer did I have to use the top camera display to see what settings I have on...this was a delight.<br />What about picture quality?  Well, One word-- stunning.  I took wildlife shots using the camera's highest resolultion and mediom compression settings, and shot pictures of swans, deer, rabbits. etc., blew them up to 8X10 and the results were amazing.  If you're looking for great photo quality, you won't be disappointed with this camera.<br />What about battery life?  The lithium-ion batter just last and last.  I shot two days worth of pictures before every having to re-charge.  This is truly a life savor, when I'm out in the park and shooting pictures, and not have to worry about the battery running low.<br />The only negative about this camera is its \"burst\" mode.  It shoots about .7 frames per second, which is a little slow for shooting action shots like sports or birds in flight, but the actuall shutter speed for getting one shot off, more than helps out in these situations.  Even though I can't shoot multipile shots quickly, I can shoot 1 shot after another at a reasonable rate, and with each shot, there is no lag time.  NO LAG TIME.  That is truly the best part about this camera.  My old digital camera the Kodak DC265, there was a period of adjustment that the 265 would go through before it actually fired.  So I would compose an image and click the shutter, only to find that the shutter won't fire until maybe a half-second latter.  But you don't have to worry about that with the Pro 90.  There is no \"shutter lag\".  Once you click the shutter release the image is immediatly taken, and that is truly a thing of beauty.<br />Overall: I am more than satisifed.  This camera is a marvel.  It shoots beautiful pictures at a glorious rate.  This is a top-notch, one-of-a kind camera, and if you happen to see one on sale, purchase it right away.  I don't know how long Canon will produce these beauties, but pick one up...you won't be disappointed.","I've been using my Pro90 IS for a few days now, and it exceded my wildest expectations.  The stabilization system allows shots impossible with out a tripod.  You have control over all the camera functions, and the flash system is a dream.  I double flashes and uses the first to get the correct exposure, similar to TTL in underwater cameras.  It has modes like the night mode which allow the subject to be illuminated by the flash and the background to be exposed properly.  The controls are functional and logical.  The viewfinder is lcd giving a slr type image.  There is a diaopter setting for the viewfinder so the icons are crisp and ledgable for everyone.  This is a winner."]}]
