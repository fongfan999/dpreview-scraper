I got this camera 2 years ago because I wanted a superzoom. Well, with the picture stabilization and the 12X zoom, I got what I wanted, but not much more. If you want to take nature photos, this camera is terrific. If you want to move on to scenery that moves, your going to have to find something else, b/c this camera does not have the shutter speed for it. Also, low light or artificial light does not come out very well either. With flash will look so-so as long as your image is within range, but the background is black. I do love this camera for being easy to use, but I've personally grown out of it. The 2 MP is also outdated.","I've had my camera for over a year after picking one up on eBay, and it is the best digital camera I've ever used (and I've used a lot).<br /><br />First of all, I totally agree with other reviewers here about how this camera quells the notion that more megapixels is better. I wouldn't know what to do with them if I had them. This camera consistently produces \"film quality\" prints.  Color saturation and tone are excellent, as well as is sharpness.<br /><br />Having an image stabilized Leica lens with a 12x zoom is what really sets this camera apart from the competition. You're never too far away from your subject with this excellent lens.<br /><br />The lens is only half the story because coupled to it is an equally, fantastic CCD imaging system. The time to turn the camera on, shoot a photo, and store it to memory is the quickest I've experienced since my first digital camera: a little Fuji Finepix A101 (which is a simple, point-and-click 2 megapixel camera).<br /><br />Speaking of my Finepix A101, I've taken photos with it and printed off 8 x 10's that many people would swear was taken with an expensive SLR film camera. To put it bluntly, the quality of the photographer also has a lot to do with what you get from a digital camera. I am an amateur photographer -- whatever that means.<br /><br />Despite the many features of the FZ1, I would recommend it for a beginner, but only if the beginner has already had some experience with film cameras and at least knows how to compose a picture with proper lighting and framing.  A few beginners may be intimidated by it, but they shouldn't be: just put it on the \"heart\" setting and fire away to your \"heart's\" content.<br /><br />The biggest weakness of ALL digital cameras is flash photography. There is no way the dinky, little flashes that come with them can do a decent job. They all tend to wash out images. Unfortunately, this camera does not have a hot shoe to allow the addition of an external flash. Photos taken with its flash will only be acceptable if there is sufficient ambient light to begin with.  My advice is to avoid flash wherever possible: instead, take advantage of its fast lens, set the ISO to 400, and use available lighting.<br /><br />Low lighting is problematic for the FZ1 as there is no infrared assist.  What I do is to either point-and-shoot, and hope for the best, or lock my focus on something bright that is the same distance away as my subject.<br /><br />Except for those situations where lighting is poor, this camera will take perfectly balanced shots under most lighting conditions. If you have to use flash, well, then, use it.<br /><br />If you can find a better camera than the FZ1 for the same money, by all means, buy it, but I seriously doubt you will. The FZ1 is as good as it gets!","I have had this camera for two years now.  I have taken many, many great photos with this camera, it's unbelievable.  It seems to do well in almost all conditions.<br /><br />I uploaded a photo I took of my daughter just last week. The original picture was in color and was fantastic all by itself.  I used virtual photographer to improve on it just a little bit by changing it to black and white and putting a soft focus on it.<br /><br />The very first picture I took with this camera had me hooked.  It's a closeup of my son.  I was trying to decide if I should keep the camera or return it for another. Well, that shot alone made me decide to keep it and I am so glad I did.","I'll be brief.  Megapixels should not be your sole consideration.  I have made 8x10 prints of pictures taken (macro and regular settings) with this camera and they are gorgeous and very detailed (I posted the full zoom photo of the truck with the dent and the macro pic of the devil ducks).  For family and vacation pix this is exactly what I need.  I think the person who wrote that 4x6 prints weren't good didn't have the camera set to the highest resolution (it has 3, with the lowest resolution intended for web viewing only).<br /><br />The low light problem may lie with me as I've re-read the manual and now taken a couple good photos in no light with the flash.  I set the camera to night rather than normal and the flash and image stabilization did the rest.<br /><br />The video quality is alright for the occasional e-mail.<br /><br />As I love the compact size I'm keeping this camera.  I was thinking of moving to a used FZ3 as that model is the same size and has the focus-assist for low light, but may hold off for now.<br /><br />Ideally I'd like a camera this size that could also take decent video with sound occasionally that I could enjoy watching on a TV. This is a little too muddy.  BTW, you can watch photos on your TV, but oddly, you can't transfer pix from your computer onto the camera's flash card and then use the camera to view them on TV. That would be a nice feature also.<br /><br />I also wish there was an ISO setting button rather than having to go into the menus, but oh well.<br /><br />Oh, get a 128MB or better flash card.  I only take pix at the highest resolution and then convert to lower for e-mail on my computer.","My partner and I decided we like snapping photos so much, that we wanted one each. We already owned a 3.2 Megapixel Sony Cybershot (with a 3x zoom), and wanted something that could zoom in - without sacrificing the quality.<br /><br />We didn't see the need in buying a hugely expensive camera - as we would prefer to buy a new camera every few years to keep up with the new releases in the market.<br /><br />When I first saw the Panasonic Lumix 2 megapixel camera in the photo shop, the shop attendant tried to talk me out of it. I was taken in with the massive 12x optical zoom! This was not even comparable to other cameras in this price range. Granted, the image quality was only 2 megapixel's, but that did not worry me in the slightest.<br /><br />I use my photos for viewing on my laptop, and sharing with others through email. I find that photos larger than 2 megapixel take a long time to send through, and some email accounts such as hotmail and yahoo cannot accept the file size as it is too large.<br /><br />A nice man in a photo processing shop told me that 2 megapixels is the same quality that a standard film camera produces in photos. Therefore, if I did want to print onto gloss paper, I would not be sacrificing the quality of the photos in any way.<br /><br />My partner and I have just moved to Alaska - and we are loving the zoom on our Panasonic Lumix. It's fantastic! No more missed photo opportunities because the old Sonly Cypershot couldn't get in close enough. The camera barely shakes even right in on the 12th level of zoom power.<br /><br />The dial at the top is easy to use, and makes shifting between types of shots easy. Move the dial from night preferred, to fast moving, to portrait, to movie, you name it. There are loads of options.<br /><br />One of the coolest things I have found with this camera is the multiple click option. Are you trying hard to capture something that is moving? Set the multiple shot button, and just hold the button down on the moving target - it takes 6 pictures in succession really quickly - so you are guarranteed to snap that shot you want.<br /><br />People who see my camera, think it's a really expensive one. I have had people ask me if it is a digital SLR! The lens is nice and big, and the viewing screen is impressive.<br /><br />This camera looks sexy, it performs well - and for the price, it's a steal.","Dumbfounded by the deluge of digicams? Spending more time obsessing on which digicam to buy, more than you did buying your house?  Like the fact the users seem to fall in love with this little wonder but are put off by the fact it's only a 2 megapixel camera? Don't worry about the megapixels. The Lumix FZ1/FZ2 is rightfully developing quite a cult following with consumers, photography enthusiasts, and even professional photographers (read \"FZ-1: A Pro-Level Digital Point & Shoot\" by Frank Van Ripper from the Washington Post available on-line at CameraWorks.com) If you can live without more megapixels, this compact camera has so much to offer.  2MP is more than you need for PC viewing, e-mail, and the web. It can and does provide sufficient resolution to make excellent photo-quality prints up to 5X7, and supposedly makes nice enlargements up to 8X10.<br />This is a compact, responsive, point and shoot camera with a robust feature set - including a capable burst mode (great for sports action shots and not found on cameras in this class), and true TTL framing via an EVF. There's enough to this camera to satiate the enthusiast - night portrait, portrait, panning, \"normal\" mode etc., and also has a fully automated mode if you want to let the camera do all the work, and just \"focus\" (pardon the pun) on composition. But what sets this digicam apart is the big zoom fixed Leica lens. It really is a word-class piece of glass with remarkable specs, especially considering its size. Combine this remarkable lens with an effective image stabilization system, and you have a \"different animal\" all together. This is a unique versitile and fun digicam that has  so much more than others in its price range. Its limitations (weak pop-up flash, EVF cuts out in low light, noise above ISO 200, etc) are really more attributable to its class ($300 point and shoot) than the camera.  However, it is capable of producing remarkable images, and once you start shooting with its high quality lens with an IS system, you'll never want a camera doesn't have them.  Plus, it is an excellent value. If you don't do a lot of enlargements or cropping in a photo editor, I would recommend the FZ1 in a heartbeat over any other camera, regardless of the number of megapixels, in its price range, and most cameras that cost two or three times as much.<br />Now a word about megapixels. A megapixel is 1 million pixels (they're the little squares that make up the image...). So, this camera produces images that are 1600 pixels wide by 1200 pixels high.  1600X1200 = approx 2 million, hence 2 megapixels. Since going digital, I find that I view 90%-95% on my PC/laptop monitor. It's convenient, and priting them all would cost a small fortune, since now that I can snap away with wreckless abandon since film (for me) is a thing of the past. (I still use a lab to print. I would rather \"borrow\" the lab's $200,000 printer than own a $300 dollar consumer photo printer, plus it costs much less per print when you factor in the cost of the printer ink...) Okay, so my laptop's highest 32 bit resolution setting is 1024X768, the resolution of the FZ1 (1600X1200) exceeds that. Point is that since I view most of my pictures on a PC now, I gain NOTHING from a higher resolution camera with more megapixels in most circumstances. The 5% to 10% of pictures I print, I usually print at standard 6X4. Anything over 200 pixels per inch (ppi) is considered \"photo quality\" for printing, 150 ppi is considered \"acceptable\".  As you get beyond 250 ppi on a print, the differences in resolution from a normal viewing distance are virtually invisible to the naked eye. IMO, I would fail a blind test, probably, if asked to guess the resolution of a picture between the 200 and 250 ppi range. 1600 (pixels)/6(inches) = 267 ppi, exceeding 250 ppi in length on a 6X4 (Note: technically, this formula isn't entirely accurate but is close enough for government work, and serves better as a quick illustration...). A 5X7 is 228 ppi, and an 8X10 is 160 ppi. Hence, this camera produces \"photo-quality\" images up to 5X7 and \"acceptable\" resolution up to 8X10. Most photo editors worth their disk space, like Photoshop, can resample images using bicubic interpolation to add pixels and boost resolution for the (very) occasional larger print. A very good product for this is Qimage, a free trial is available, and it's quite inexpensive to purchase. A hot shoe would have been nice but my understanding is that a \"digital slave flash\", which are quite reasonably priced, like the Vivitar AF200, work very well when you need a big flash.<br />Now consider, not a \"scientific survey\" but 3 or 4 folks I know own 3 to 5 megapixel cameras.  (The 5 megapixel guy has a 10X optical zoom camera, made by one of the usual suspects, that cost 2X as much as the FZ1, but he doesn't even attempt zooming out beyond 5X without blurring the image, since his camera doesn't have IS). None of them kept their cameras on the highest setting thereby \"using\" all the megapixels. Why? Because the larger image files cut the amount of pictures they can store on their flash cards in half, their camera annoyingly \"locks up\" for a couple seconds while it writes a larger image file (often very frustrating), and they really can't notice a difference in quality on their prints, and they view most of their pictures on their PC. Let's say you have a 6 megapixel camera that had a cheap lens that introduced all sorts of distortion and a processing engine that rendered inaccurate colors. What would you get? A crappy picture with distortion and inaccurate colors rendered in all their ugly glory in high resolution. The FZ1 has the \"best\" lens on the market, and an excellent, innovative processing engine that provides \"enough\" but not \"extraneous\" megapixels to provide photoquality resolution for 99% of \"real world\" viewing formats. I believe that camera companies are exploiting the conspicuous consumption factor of camera consumers who wear their camera around their neck like jewelery. (The \"name\" + many megapixels = \"the guy\" equivalent of a pearl necklace to wear on a night out). It is therefore a great way for the camera co's to (finally) introduce planned obsolence into their offerings, dispensing with the days when folks held on to their cameras for decades until they finally died. I'm glad at least one manufacturer withdrew from the \"great megapixel wars\" and offered an excellent product based around real user needs and the true advantages of the full range of available technology - like IS and its processing engine, and did so at a very reasonable cost, instead of being just another combatant exploiting one aspect - \"the megapixel\", and the conspicuous consumption factor.<br />Get the picture?","I made lots of research before buying this camera. I previously owned a Sony DSC-F707 which I sold because it was too bulky to carry around. The Sony was a great camera but I wanted something with a more powerful lens and an image stabilizer. The Panasonic was the only camera that seemed to fit my needs. I was hesitant at first because my Sony was a 5.0MP camera and the Panasonic only a 2.0MP camera. I read numerous reviews from other owners and researched websites like Steves Digicams, DC Resource and Megapixel.Net that spoke very highly of this camera. What I learned is that megapixels is an important feature to consider when choosing a digital camera, but there are other more important features to consider like the quality of components being used. This camera has a Leica lens. If you don't know anything about Leica, you should do some research and you will be amazed to know that Leica is a high end professional brand that is not cheap and considered one of the best in the world. The other item that stands out about this camera is the processor that converts the image to a digital image. This is a really important feature to consider because the processor is what determines how effective it is at converting the image to the original shot. This camera uses Panasonic's Venus image that does numerous functions at the same time which allows the camera to operate faster and smoother which is similar to the Digic processor on Canon cameras. This processor also increases image quality by 50%, because of this, the photos are far superior to any 2.0MP camera out there. The camera is extremely well built and very rugged. The photo quality from this camera is amazing, it honestly does not seem like a 2.0MP camera. The quality of the photos seems to close to a 4.0MP camera. The lens is extremely quiet and fast. The image stabilization works extremely well and allows you to take photos at full telephoto view without any problems. I highly recommend this camera. You will be impressed with the quality of construction, features and picture quality.","Had high expectations with Leica lens but picture quality is below average. Tried developing photos at Costco and Ofoto and it was the camera and not development service. It's fragile and sand got caught very easily. Dissapointing... Avoid. I can now see why the retailers are liqudating this camera.","This is my first digital camera, having used a Kodak Advantix with some zoom capability for the past several years. The cost of film, development, lost pictures and negatives made the purchase of a digital camera a no brainer. However, the one thing lacking from most digital cameras I had seen was an optical zoom. Digital zoom is almost meaningless, so don't be fooled by ads such as \"3x Digital Zoom\" which doesn't do much alone. I researched various other models, including the Olympus zoom models, but chose this camera because of the terrific price, quality glass Leica lense, compact size and the unbelieveable 12x optical zoom with picture stabilization, which is necessary to take non-blurry pictures at full zoom. The only concern I had was some negative comments by Amazon reviewers regarding low light photos. The first thing I did when I received the camera was take some photos of people in low light conditions at distances over 10 feet with the flash on. I discovered two things: (1) The pictures came out fine. (2) Hey I can use this thing without even looking at the instructions! It is a very simple camera to use, the screen menus are easy to navigate and activate options. The key theme here being the lack of frustration. There is a dial on the camera with little pictures or icons such as: a camera (when you are in normal photo mode), a car (to photo moving objects), a flower (to photo extreme close-ups), a person with a star above them (night photos). It can't be easier than that. Turn that dial to shoot video, press the shutter and you now are recording home video- as long as your memory card permits. I recommend purchasing a large memory card, 128 Megabytes is sufficient, since the 8 MB card that comes with the camera will only let you take about 30 high quality photos. The instruction manual is the best I have seen for an electronic product. Each page has a large heading at the top for the action you are trying to accomplish, i.e., take photos, record video, play back video, delete pictures. This makes it quick to find the topic. Underneath that heading are the simple steps, with diagrams showing you what to do. A positive of this camera is that once you learn how to accomplish an action, it is so intuitive you will likely never have to refer to the manual again once you have tried it.<br />I was unconcerned about some mild criticisms about the lack of manual adjustability of certain camera-tech related functions, which I admittedly do not understand. I am not a professional photographer so I don't feel as I am missing anything, nor will you if you just take casual family, event and vacation related photos.<br />The second day I had the camera I took it outside and shot some full zoom photos with the picture stabilization feature on. I was stunned by the detail, clarity and quality of the pictures I could obtain from objects at incredible distances. I cannot imagine ever using a camera without an optical zoom again. It simply opens up a whole new world of possiblilites for your pictures and frees you from the limitations of a regular camera, without the need to carry around a bunch of bulky zoom lenses like you might see a professional photogopher use.<br />The camera seems very sturdy, comes with a nice strap, fine lense cap with its own micro strap connecting it to the camera if you like, to prevent it from being lost. I was initially dissappointed that Amazon only offered the black model, but it looks nicer in person then on the web page. I am now glad they only sell the black version because it looks sharp. If you want some technical oriented reviews, versus an anecdotal review, there are many fine detailed reviews, with examples of actual photos taken using the camera on the web. I liked the one at Digital Camera Resource.","I want to just let you know that I am definetely not a pro, but an average person, so that is how I'm writing my review.

I only take pix at the highest resolution and then convert to lower for e-mail on my computer.","My partner and I decided we like snapping photos so much, that we wanted one each. We already owned a 3.2 Megapixel Sony Cybershot (with a 3x zoom), and wanted something that could zoom in - without sacrificing the quality.<br /><br />We didn't see the need in buying a hugely expensive camera - as we would prefer to buy a new camera every few years to keep up with the new releases in the market.<br /><br />When I first saw the Panasonic Lumix 2 megapixel camera in the photo shop, the shop attendant tried to talk me out of it. I was taken in with the massive 12x optical zoom! This was not even comparable to other cameras in this price range. Granted, the image quality was only 2 megapixel's, but that did not worry me in the slightest.<br /><br />I use my photos for viewing on my laptop, and sharing with others through email. I find that photos larger than 2 megapixel take a long time to send through, and some email accounts such as hotmail and yahoo cannot accept the file size as it is too large.<br /><br />A nice man in a photo processing shop told me that 2 megapixels is the same quality that a standard film camera produces in photos. Therefore, if I did want to print onto gloss paper, I would not be sacrificing the quality of the photos in any way.<br /><br />My partner and I have just moved to Alaska - and we are loving the zoom on our Panasonic Lumix. It's fantastic! No more missed photo opportunities because the old Sonly Cypershot couldn't get in close enough. The camera barely shakes even right in on the 12th level of zoom power.<br /><br />The dial at the top is easy to use, and makes shifting between types of shots easy. Move the dial from night preferred, to fast moving, to portrait, to movie, you name it. There are loads of options.<br /><br />One of the coolest things I have found with this camera is the multiple click option. Are you trying hard to capture something that is moving? Set the multiple shot button, and just hold the button down on the moving target - it takes 6 pictures in succession really quickly - so you are guarranteed to snap that shot you want.<br /><br />People who see my camera, think it's a really expensive one. I have had people ask me if it is a digital SLR! The lens is nice and big, and the viewing screen is impressive.<br /><br />This camera looks sexy, it performs well - and for the price, it's a steal.","Dumbfounded by the deluge of digicams? Spending more time obsessing on which digicam to buy, more than you did buying your house?  Like the fact the users seem to fall in love with this little wonder but are put off by the fact it's only a 2 megapixel camera? Don't worry about the megapixels. The Lumix FZ1/FZ2 is rightfully developing quite a cult following with consumers, photography enthusiasts, and even professional photographers (read \"FZ-1: A Pro-Level Digital Point & Shoot\" by Frank Van Ripper from the Washington Post available on-line at CameraWorks.com) If you can live without more megapixels, this compact camera has so much to offer.  2MP is more than you need for PC viewing, e-mail, and the web. It can and does provide sufficient resolution to make excellent photo-quality prints up to 5X7, and supposedly makes nice enlargements up to 8X10.<br />This is a compact, responsive, point and shoot camera with a robust feature set - including a capable burst mode (great for sports action shots and not found on cameras in this class), and true TTL framing via an EVF. There's enough to this camera to satiate the enthusiast - night portrait, portrait, panning, \"normal\" mode etc., and also has a fully automated mode if you want to let the camera do all the work, and just \"focus\" (pardon the pun) on composition. But what sets this digicam apart is the big zoom fixed Leica lens. It really is a word-class piece of glass with remarkable specs, especially considering its size. Combine this remarkable lens with an effective image stabilization system, and you have a \"different animal\" all together. This is a unique versitile and fun digicam that has  so much more than others in its price range. Its limitations (weak pop-up flash, EVF cuts out in low light, noise above ISO 200, etc) are really more attributable to its class ($300 point and shoot) than the camera.  However, it is capable of producing remarkable images, and once you start shooting with its high quality lens with an IS system, you'll never want a camera doesn't have them.  Plus, it is an excellent value. If you don't do a lot of enlargements or cropping in a photo editor, I would recommend the FZ1 in a heartbeat over any other camera, regardless of the number of megapixels, in its price range, and most cameras that cost two or three times as much.<br />Now a word about megapixels. A megapixel is 1 million pixels (they're the little squares that make up the image...). So, this camera produces images that are 1600 pixels wide by 1200 pixels high.  1600X1200 = approx 2 million, hence 2 megapixels. Since going digital, I find that I view 90%-95% on my PC/laptop monitor. It's convenient, and priting them all would cost a small fortune, since now that I can snap away with wreckless abandon since film (for me) is a thing of the past. (I still use a lab to print. I would rather \"borrow\" the lab's $200,000 printer than own a $300 dollar consumer photo printer, plus it costs much less per print when you factor in the cost of the printer ink...) Okay, so my laptop's highest 32 bit resolution setting is 1024X768, the resolution of the FZ1 (1600X1200) exceeds that. Point is that since I view most of my pictures on a PC now, I gain NOTHING from a higher resolution camera with more megapixels in most circumstances. The 5% to 10% of pictures I print, I usually print at standard 6X4. Anything over 200 pixels per inch (ppi) is considered \"photo quality\" for printing, 150 ppi is considered \"acceptable\".  As you get beyond 250 ppi on a print, the differences in resolution from a normal viewing distance are virtually invisible to the naked eye. IMO, I would fail a blind test, probably, if asked to guess the resolution of a picture between the 200 and 250 ppi range. 1600 (pixels)/6(inches) = 267 ppi, exceeding 250 ppi in length on a 6X4 (Note: technically, this formula isn't entirely accurate but is close enough for government work, and serves better as a quick illustration...). A 5X7 is 228 ppi, and an 8X10 is 160 ppi. Hence, this camera produces \"photo-quality\" images up to 5X7 and \"acceptable\" resolution up to 8X10. Most photo editors worth their disk space, like Photoshop, can resample images using bicubic interpolation to add pixels and boost resolution for the (very) occasional larger print. A very good product for this is Qimage, a free trial is available, and it's quite inexpensive to purchase. A hot shoe would have been nice but my understanding is that a \"digital slave flash\", which are quite reasonably priced, like the Vivitar AF200, work very well when you need a big flash.<br />Now consider, not a \"scientific survey\" but 3 or 4 folks I know own 3 to 5 megapixel cameras.  (The 5 megapixel guy has a 10X optical zoom camera, made by one of the usual suspects, that cost 2X as much as the FZ1, but he doesn't even attempt zooming out beyond 5X without blurring the image, since his camera doesn't have IS). None of them kept their cameras on the highest setting thereby \"using\" all the megapixels. Why? Because the larger image files cut the amount of pictures they can store on their flash cards in half, their camera annoyingly \"locks up\" for a couple seconds while it writes a larger image file (often very frustrating), and they really can't notice a difference in quality on their prints, and they view most of their pictures on their PC. Let's say you have a 6 megapixel camera that had a cheap lens that introduced all sorts of distortion and a processing engine that rendered inaccurate colors. What would you get? A crappy picture with distortion and inaccurate colors rendered in all their ugly glory in high resolution. The FZ1 has the \"best\" lens on the market, and an excellent, innovative processing engine that provides \"enough\" but not \"extraneous\" megapixels to provide photoquality resolution for 99% of \"real world\" viewing formats. I believe that camera companies are exploiting the conspicuous consumption factor of camera consumers who wear their camera around their neck like jewelery. (The \"name\" + many megapixels = \"the guy\" equivalent of a pearl necklace to wear on a night out). It is therefore a great way for the camera co's to (finally) introduce planned obsolence into their offerings, dispensing with the days when folks held on to their cameras for decades until they finally died. I'm glad at least one manufacturer withdrew from the \"great megapixel wars\" and offered an excellent product based around real user needs and the true advantages of the full range of available technology - like IS and its processing engine, and did so at a very reasonable cost, instead of being just another combatant exploiting one aspect - \"the megapixel\", and the conspicuous consumption factor.<br />Get the picture?","I made lots of research before buying this camera. I previously owned a Sony DSC-F707 which I sold because it was too bulky to carry around. The Sony was a great camera but I wanted something with a more powerful lens and an image stabilizer. The Panasonic was the only camera that seemed to fit my needs. I was hesitant at first because my Sony was a 5.0MP camera and the Panasonic only a 2.0MP camera. I read numerous reviews from other owners and researched websites like Steves Digicams, DC Resource and Megapixel.Net that spoke very highly of this camera. What I learned is that megapixels is an important feature to consider when choosing a digital camera, but there are other more important features to consider like the quality of components being used. This camera has a Leica lens. If you don't know anything about Leica, you should do some research and you will be amazed to know that Leica is a high end professional brand that is not cheap and considered one of the best in the world. The other item that stands out about this camera is the processor that converts the image to a digital image. This is a really important feature to consider because the processor is what determines how effective it is at converting the image to the original shot. This camera uses Panasonic's Venus image that does numerous functions at the same time which allows the camera to operate faster and smoother which is similar to the Digic processor on Canon cameras. This processor also increases image quality by 50%, because of this, the photos are far superior to any 2.0MP camera out there. The camera is extremely well built and very rugged. The photo quality from this camera is amazing, it honestly does not seem like a 2.0MP camera. The quality of the photos seems to close to a 4.0MP camera. The lens is extremely quiet and fast. The image stabilization works extremely well and allows you to take photos at full telephoto view without any problems. I highly recommend this camera. You will be impressed with the quality of construction, features and picture quality.","Had high expectations with Leica lens but picture quality is below average. Tried developing photos at Costco and Ofoto and it was the camera and not development service. It's fragile and sand got caught very easily. Dissapointing... Avoid. I can now see why the retailers are liqudating this camera.","This is my first digital camera, having used a Kodak Advantix with some zoom capability for the past several years. The cost of film, development, lost pictures and negatives made the purchase of a digital camera a no brainer. However, the one thing lacking from most digital cameras I had seen was an optical zoom. Digital zoom is almost meaningless, so don't be fooled by ads such as \"3x Digital Zoom\" which doesn't do much alone. I researched various other models, including the Olympus zoom models, but chose this camera because of the terrific price, quality glass Leica lense, compact size and the unbelieveable 12x optical zoom with picture stabilization, which is necessary to take non-blurry pictures at full zoom. The only concern I had was some negative comments by Amazon reviewers regarding low light photos. The first thing I did when I received the camera was take some photos of people in low light conditions at distances over 10 feet with the flash on. I discovered two things: (1) The pictures came out fine. (2) Hey I can use this thing without even looking at the instructions! It is a very simple camera to use, the screen menus are easy to navigate and activate options. The key theme here being the lack of frustration. There is a dial on the camera with little pictures or icons such as: a camera (when you are in normal photo mode), a car (to photo moving objects), a flower (to photo extreme close-ups), a person with a star above them (night photos). It can't be easier than that. Turn that dial to shoot video, press the shutter and you now are recording home video- as long as your memory card permits. I recommend purchasing a large memory card, 128 Megabytes is sufficient, since the 8 MB card that comes with the camera will only let you take about 30 high quality photos. The instruction manual is the best I have seen for an electronic product. Each page has a large heading at the top for the action you are trying to accomplish, i.e., take photos, record video, play back video, delete pictures. This makes it quick to find the topic. Underneath that heading are the simple steps, with diagrams showing you what to do. A positive of this camera is that once you learn how to accomplish an action, it is so intuitive you will likely never have to refer to the manual again once you have tried it.<br />I was unconcerned about some mild criticisms about the lack of manual adjustability of certain camera-tech related functions, which I admittedly do not understand. I am not a professional photographer so I don't feel as I am missing anything, nor will you if you just take casual family, event and vacation related photos.<br />The second day I had the camera I took it outside and shot some full zoom photos with the picture stabilization feature on. I was stunned by the detail, clarity and quality of the pictures I could obtain from objects at incredible distances. I cannot imagine ever using a camera without an optical zoom again. It simply opens up a whole new world of possiblilites for your pictures and frees you from the limitations of a regular camera, without the need to carry around a bunch of bulky zoom lenses like you might see a professional photogopher use.<br />The camera seems very sturdy, comes with a nice strap, fine lense cap with its own micro strap connecting it to the camera if you like, to prevent it from being lost. I was initially dissappointed that Amazon only offered the black model, but it looks nicer in person then on the web page. I am now glad they only sell the black version because it looks sharp. If you want some technical oriented reviews, versus an anecdotal review, there are many fine detailed reviews, with examples of actual photos taken using the camera on the web. I liked the one at Digital Camera Resource.","I researched digital cameras for two months before deciding on this one. Even though this was my first digital camera, right out-of-the-box I was able to take great pictures. Now that I've had it a month, and am more familiar with the features of the various modes, I'm taking even better pics. Here's the most important tips I found:<br />1. Megapixels are important for enlargements. But don't let the 2mp turn you off. If you're not going to enlarge your pics bigger than 8x10, YOU DON'T NEED ANY MORE! Don't make the mistake of paying for more megapixels than you will use.<br />2. The lens quality is just as important as the mp, more than in my opinion, and it's often overlooked. The Leica lens in this camera is awesome! Great quality optics.<br />3. Optical Zoom, (not digital zoom), is important. This camera has remarkable zoom. You may want to get a tripod if you're using the full zoom on a regular basis, although this camera has a good stabilizer. As with any camera with such a long zoom, there may still be some evidence of shaking if you extend the zoom fully and do not use a tripod.<br /> As with almost any digital camera out there, the memory card included is practically worthless. I recommend one with 125mb or more. Other than this, the camera is near perfect.","I bought this Camera a few weeks back and have been very happy with it. This camera is very easy to use and has a very good optical zoom. The battery which comes with the camera is very good should last a day if you dont review your pictures often. The macro mode takes good pictures. The day light pictures are of excellent quality but the night time are ones not as good as the day light ones if you are 6-7 feet away from the subject. The image stabilization is pretty good. The camera comes with a 8 MB SD card. But Panasonic was shipping a free 128 MB SD card (I believe offer is valid till Oct 30'03) which holds around 150 medium sized pictures.","I suffer from a disorder that makes my hands shake so much that I have had to use a tripod and timer for the last few years. With the FZ1 and the IS lens I can now take handheld photos, even at 12X zoom. The EVF is bright and legible and I no longer have to wear glasses when taking photos.<br />The pictures are brighter and sharper at 2mp than my 3.2mp Sony DSC-F505V. This camera has put the fun back into photography for me and it will for you also. It is simple to use for the beginner and the experienced shooter will appreciate the different modes and the versatility that they offer.<br />I highly recommend the FZ1 to everyone. This gives new meaning to bang for the buck and you will love the Leica 12X IS lens.","Don't fall for megapixal envy!  A 12x stabalized optical zoom on this 2.1MP camera will out perform a 4MP camera cropped to the same field of view.<br />I've used three digital cameras; a Canon A40 (2.1MP), an Olympus D-40 (4.0MP) and the FZ1.  It is no contest the FZ1 takes the best pictures, has the quickest shutter response, the most accurate color reproduction and an amazing lens that allows shots the others cannot dream of taking...<br />Manual controls would be nice, but not missed much at all.<br />Once again, you cannot crop a 4 or 5MP image to the same field of view as this camera at 12x optical zoom and achieve the same quality.  If you are not making posters, 2.1MP is plenty.<br />You won't be disappointed.","I waited for a product like this for many years, I was worried about it having only 2.1 megapixels, but I said to myself let's try it, I used to have a 3.2 megapixel from Sony and no comparison the photos I've taken with Panasonic camera are way over in quality and with that zoom there is no need to crop a picture to zoom in the part I want to print, loosing quality in the previous procedure.<br />Leica Lens are the difference, Does anyone know that LEICA built microscope Lens, that is why this camera pays for it own.<br />From nature lovers to family pictures it is great and easy to use, if you just are looking for a point and shot use the heart selection, if you are on the photo lover side of manual control use all the other.<br />In few words, great camera.","This is an incredible camera.  Although reviewed in a negative manner for not having many manual settings, you won't find that you need them very often because the automatic settings on this camera handles things so well.  The 12x optical Leica lens is just incredible, and it's actually useable at full zoom due to the stabilization.  The 3x digital zoom is a nice plus, and still produces great pictures when used.<br />The electronic viewfinder is bright and clear (to see your subject in low light, make sure you change the default ISO 50 setting to ISO Auto).  The autofocus works as well as any other digicam, but I do wish it had a manual focus option for those few times that I've needed it.<br />I previously owned a Kodak 2.2 megapixel camera, and the FZ1's pictures are MUCH better quality.  Probably due to the better lens as well as Panasonics new image processor which is supposed to increase diagonal resolution by 50% and produce smoother pictures.<br />My camera prior to the FZ1 was a Sony Mavica FD91.  It has a 14x optical zoom, but only a sub-megapixel resolution.  The quality of picture is just exponentially better in the FZ1, while still offering close to the same optical zoom and in a better quality lens.<br />Could I have bought a higher megapixel camera?  Sure, but there isn't one with this nice of a lens/zoom.  Most of the higher megapixel cameras just have a lousey 3x zoom and I really needed something more than that after owning the Sony FD91 with its 14x zoom.<br />... .<br />I highly recommend this camera, and feel I will be very happy with it for a long time to come.","Wow, was I pleasantly surprised by the image quality of this camera.  My purchase was decided by the best available optical zoom (12x) because of nature and sports photography.  The quality produced by this unit was a bonus.<br />Easy and fun to use, this camera belongs with anyone who likes to take long shots.  The stabilizing system works very well and the low light performance is very good.<br />I highly recommend this one and amazon. com has the best deal by far.  Oh, immediately order a 256k sd card.  The included 8k card is best left at home.","First, I'd like to say that I've owned about 7 different digital cameras, and this has got to be my favorite out of the bunch.  I travel a lot, so I enjoy taking a lot of photos, and this camera has just made picture taking fun again!  Its controls are easy to use, making it a great point-and-shoot camera for someone who's new to digital photography.  The 12x optical zoom using a Leica lens is the BIGGEST optical lens on a digital camera, and the image stabilization help to make this huge zoom usable without a tripod.  Thanks to the Leica lens, colors are vivid, and the photos come out crisp.<br />I only have two complaints about the camera, but only one is important: it's a 2 MP camera.  With a lens like this, Panasonic should've made it at least a 3.  That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating...but I was still tempted to.  I like to make 4x6 pics, but 2 MP doesn't make for nice 4x6's.  The other complaint is that many controls and settings are preset, so serious photographers won't like it (but serious shooters would avoid it anyway, because it's a 2 MP).<br />All that said, at this price, you won't find a better point-and-shoot camera with a big zoom lens.  The camera is compact (it still fits in the palm of my hand), has a fast start up time (considering the lens) and a fast shot-to-shot time.  The controls and settings are easy to understand for beginners and did I mention the 12x zoom?  It's a great camera for fun photography.  If you don't make too many 4x6 prints, this camera is incredible--buy it!","The bad points first: Auto-focusing can be slow (too slow for close-up graduation photos); cannot imprint date/time on a picutre (although info is stored with file when transferred to computer); batteries last only about 200 shots at max resolution; no manual focusing for tricky situations; cannot mount protective filter without blocking some light (vignetting).<br />Otherwise, a really great camera.  Even 8x11 prints are good enough (the Leica lens really shines).  We also have a smaller 4-meg SONY, but much prefer this 2-meg Panasonic for versatility.  Especially great for paintings in museum that allow photos without flash---the reproductions of masterpieces are really impressive.  The zoom is awesome.  Grainy at 36x but give some prints a artsy look.  Takes better flash photos (not over-exposed) than both the SONY 3-meg and 4-meg that we have.<br />With a 256MB SD card...can take about 25 minutes of Apple Quicktime movie (cannot zoom while shooting) or 300 pictures at max resolution.  Cheap when bought online...","I wasn't sure that the 2 megapixel camera was adequate for taking great photos...but what it lacks in pixels it makes up in zoom.  My 3 megapixel Canon Powershot camera was great except at the beach when the kids where surfing 50 feet out in the water. Taking a picture with a 3x zoom left me lots of water and little of the kids.  But the Panasonic with it 12x zoom allows me to better frame the picture and leave out all of that water.<br />Printing an 8x11 photo is better with 3 megapixels but for a 4x6 or a 5x7 the 2megapixels is wonderful.  The Panasonic also has a 3x digital zoom...which I don't recommend using and I don't use it on the Canon either...the resulting pictures are too grainy.<br />55mm filters fit right on the lens ring adapter kit that comes with the camera and a hood is also supplied.  The leica lens is fast even in zoom....it opens to a 2.8.<br />Some of the features that I don't see on comparably priced cameras include - image stablizer (crucial for 12x zoom without a tripod), electronic view finder along with an lcd display on the back of the camera (each can display camera settings and information)  a movie mode that allows capturing 10 frames per second with sound (the length is determined by the capacity of your memory card...I've taken up to 20 minute clips of a surfing competition), autoexposure bracketing with the exposure compensation predetermined by the user, shutter speed from 8 sec to 1/2000th of a second.<br />There is one thing that bugs me and one thing that may bug others...my pet peeve is the menu system which uses a ring to navigate through the menu options...I have a dickens of a time trying to select options using the left arrow on the ring...what generally happens is that the ring behaves as if I have selected the up arrow or the down arrow.  Others may dislike the built in flash, good to about 7 feet....but I don't use it.  I bought this camera for outdoor use at the beach and park...and I'm completely happy using it there.","...Basically, the 12X zoom convinced me, plus many of the advanced consumer functions such as bracketing and burst mode shooting.  I shoot outdoors a great deal, especially sports, and this is a nice compromise between the cheaper cost of a point and shoot and the full features of a digital SLR.","You can't beat this one for the money, ease of use and overall results. Yes, it's hard to focus in low light indoors, but you see your image immediately so you can retake and compensate accordingly. Yes, it's only 2 megapixels, but I want to see a technical review of Panasonic's new Venus engine that drives it, because I suspect it performs to near the specs of others 3 megapix sensors. Yes, you are limited because there's no manual focus. But the lens is stopped to F2.8 through it's entire range, there's image stabilization (that works!) and the 12 x optical zoom! It's small and fits well in your hand. The battery pack seems to last a long time.  I paid full price (449.00) willingly, so if you can get it for under four bills go for it! This is a lot of fun to use!"]},{"name":"Kodak EasyShare CX4300","amazon_reviews":["THIS CAMERA TAKES GREAT PICS AND NICE CLOSE UPS.  THE CAMERA IS NICE HAS 3X ZOOM FOR CLOSE UPS.

It takes some getting used too but after you learn the buttons, it is a breeze. I am a happy customer.","amazing that after all these years a camera that can still produce fabulous results.shames most canon and Nikon crop sensor camers still today.at the time was one of the most expensive cameras in the world.purchased in lots of 1500 cameras by espn,abc,nbc,bbc photo journalists.","Item received today. Condition is excellent. Battery and battery charger included, but not user manual. I downloaded the manual for $4.99 from another website.","Not up to a value expected for the price I paid.... There are cameras with superior technology available (used) at a similar price.","La commande est conforme l'appareil est comme neuf. Petit bémol il ne s'allume plus au bout de quelques jours. SAV contacté qui me promet un remboursement, puis finalement il remarche. les qualités du 1ds ne sont plus à faire.

But can't complain with the image quality.","Great product. Great seller. Enjoyed the product. I want to sell it because I bought a 5d mii and it has the same features.","NOW, I can finally use the numerous EOS lens as well as using an adapter my collection of fine-quality (some Canon) of FD lens.<br /><br />The unit is HEAVY and will probably require either a mono- or tripod for comfortable use.  A smaller all-in-one Canon is better used as a main camera and save this camera for 'special events' or super-wide, very close macro, and long telephoto photos.<br /><br />It's almost like a Rolls-Royce with a precision machine shop packed in the trunk!<br /><br />I WILL be making an adapter to use an auxiliary 12 Volt battery to relieve some of the 'hand weight.'<br /><br />The price was SUPER GREAT, and I have been doing business with KEH for several decades and NO PROBLEMS OR DISSATISFACTON!","I hadn't planned on buying a used 1-Ds, but the low price for a \"like-new\" body with low shutter count was too tempting to pass up.

It takes some getting used too but after you learn the buttons, it is a breeze. I am a happy customer.","This is an incredible peice of digital equipment and has more features than the space shuttle. It is most definitely a camera for a younger man however because it's HEAVY, especially with the 70-200 f/28 mounted. I can't imagine lugging around the really LONG lenses. I wore it around my neck for an entire day during a recent shoot and conlcuded that it would be best used in a studio environment on a tripod, or at least a monopod. I have owned several 35mm film cameras and at least seven different digital cameras including Kyocera, Epson, Olympus (2 different models, C2500L & E-10) and finally  three Canons: the EOS 1Ds 11.1mp, the Powershot G7 10.1mp, and now the 5D 12.1mp. So far the last two have been the best for my purposes. The quality of course is in the glass, but the artistry is up to the photographer and so far Canon has delivered the very best I could hope for. EOS is an awesome system and the 1DS, aside from the weight is one of the very best.","I've recently learned some interesting detail that came from a talented amateur photographer.  A friend of mine from work, had done a number of spectacular scenic shots.  He thought to enter some of the better ones into a professional competition. While he had a good Cannon digital, (I believe it was a 7 or 8 mp) requirements for digital are 11 mp minimums.  While expanding the lower resolution is allowed, it would still fall a bit short (since it only allows a certain percentage).  It seems that professional film use cameras, typically deliver the equivalent of 20 mp. The proper film is expensive, and getting it developed is not as easy as taking it to the local Photomat.<br /><br />I know computers and software.  My programming exploits placed me for a time at Polaroid ID systems. Polaroid ID, (prior to its sale by the parent company in 2001) produced drivers licenses, and ID card solutions, for more than half the United States, plus several countries. I have a background in video games programming by training.  What I can tell you from this is that you need a fast processor to create, and store an image 11 mp in size.  Cannon's custom processor seems to be up to the task.  My friend told me his current camera used the same processor, and produced the highest resolution shots in about 1/5th of a second. This model does about three continuous shots per second.  While not quite film or motion capture speed, it's still good enough not to inhibit your creativity.<br /><br />If photography is a serious hobby, or you are a budding professional, this might just be your camera.  Existing professionals will probably make up their own minds on when to jump to digital, and what equipment best meets their needs.  Cannons entry here seems reasonable for a quality digital camera.  You may see many other cameras pump up their numbers in a race to get the higher resolutions. They seem to be bristling with bells and whistles.  There's a not so subtle difference with a professional model like this.  That being it has features for professional imaging and the speed of getting to that next high quality shot.<br /><br />The other cameras will raise the bar one day, but for now they are best used by non-professionals.  If you compare the camera's specifications, you'll find speed, and feature limitations on those cheaper models.  This is not the camera to take on that vacation to the mountains.  A good four-mega pixel model will keep all your family photo albums up to date.  If however, your vision for looking at the world through the camera's eye extends beyond that, this may be the camera for you.  BTW, remember this is a body only, you buy your optics separately, and it's not advisable to go cheap either.","After years of being a very faithful Sony user (I still like Sony and their products) I finally did the big leap, as in my mind the technology is finally there ... I bought a Canon EOS-1Ds 11.1 Megapixel camera body. Out of necessity I had to buy a set of EF lenses as well. I spent this years toy budget on just one purchase, but then THIS IS NOT TOY!<br />My last Sony was a F828 and before that a P10. The F828 is a great consumer product for the price, but it actually made me do the leap as good as it is, as it brought back my spirit for creating a REALLY good picture. I started to spend so much time to get to the right photo spot at the right time, that I did not want to have a lack of functionality then. I used to do a lot of photography 20 years ago on film, but returned as a point and shoot fotographer when digital came about. To say it with fellow countryman 'Arnie' - \"I'm back.\"<br />First I need to say that all Amazon partnershops performed and delivered flawlessly, my special mention goes to Adorama Camera. I would usually be worried to spend so much money on the web, but Amazon takes that away.<br />Now to the 'beast' itself the EOS-1Ds body. I will not go into all the functional details, as to my mind they are all correct as stated. The camera is great to hold and work with total confidence. But at first - big disappointment. I was unable to concentrate on working with a professional camera. I was too used to point and shoot and expected the camera to do it all for me. Well, it does not. You need to know or learn photography for this one. It is now four weeks and 2500 pictures later and finally there is only one reason for a photo not to be perfect - ME!<br />Biggest difference to other products is the film-size 24x36 CCD and the ability to set the ASA film sensitivity up to 1250 on the fly rather than having to change film. Not always is a tripod at hand or the photo subject would wait until you set it up and then hold still for a 2 second exposure. I could not ask the helicopter pilot to stop the vibration during a dawn flight over the Las Vegas Strip. Setting to ASA1250 shortened exposure time to s/50. The picture noise that you get as a consequence is dramatically reduced by the noise reduction feature and much less than the grain of a high-sensitivity film.<br />Cautions and recommendations: Learning how to clean the sensor from dust and dirt without damaging it is essential. This camera is VERY heavy you will need a strong tripod to hold it. Buy a second battery, even so the charging is quick and it usually lasts for two normal days of use. Using a CF card reader is easier than buying a Firwire attachment for your PC. Use 2GB high-speed Compactflash for convenience, it will give you 400 pictures in JPG. Feel free to send me questions, which I will answer as much as I can.","I have shot 35mm for 30 years and paid for the best prints from the best labs and they just can't compare with high end digital prints.  The detail goes way beyond 35mm and easily challenges medium format.  I am still learning color manipulation on the computer and occasionally I get better color from a Velvia slide - which I am now shooting with the same Canon lenses and a 1v body - but overall it is becoming increasingly clear that film is as dead as video tape and vinyl records.  I traded up to the 1Ds from a D60, which also produced prints much better than 35mm.  The drawback to the D60 was a poor autofocus and a less than full frame sensor, which limits the use of wide angle lenses for landscape photos.  The 1Ds solves those problems and potentially makes larger format cameras obsolete at the same time.<br />The only problem I have found is that the 45 sensor autofocus setting does not work with a very wide angle (16mm or 15mm fisheye) lens.  For some reason, it won't focus at infinity.  Switching to the center only focus sensor solves the problem.  The 1v and Elan 7 do the same thing.","Our rep brought an EOS-1Ds into the lab for us to look at last week.  I'm still pouring over the test bench and outdoor images with my jaw on the floor.  I'll never be able to afford this beauty, but if we see the technology of the 1Ds make it into the prosumer market, I'll make the jump.  Many of the so-called limitations of digital photography have been directly addressed in the design of the 1Ds.<br />For example, the small physical dimensions of consumer camera CCDs have limited the performance of many cameras.  It's nearly impossible to collect and focus light onto a small CCD with inexpensive optics.  Canon uses a larger size CCD in the 1Ds. That upgrade, plus having the CCD house 11 megapixels makes this camera instantly competitive with 35 mm film.  Note, I'm not yet ready to say it's the equivalent, but it's so close now that the few advantages of film have much less leverage now.  The future is here and it is now.  If only I had 8 grand in my pocket...<br />I didn't have enough time with the 1Ds to get to know all of the bells and whistles, but did find it easy enough to use by just trusting my intuition.  I'm looking at the nice collection of Canon 35 mm lenses I already own (which will fit the 1Ds) and my palms are sweating.  Maybe I could sell a few of the toys I don't use much and eat macaroni and cheese for a few years?"]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-U20","amazon_reviews":["This is an incredible little camera.

This camera met all 3 requirements easily.<br />Size: almost as small as the current crop of cell phones. People couldn't believe how small it was. Personally, it's a little on the thick side so I put it in my pants instead of my shirt pocket.<br />Price: good value for your money. More features than you'd expect from a sub camera. Comes with its own recharger and NI-MH batteries. About 13 hours to charge it fully.<br />Picture quality: I was actually quite surprised by the picture quality. Really. It's more than just decent or average, it's good. Movie quality however is terrible. Don't bother with it unless you are outdoors with lots of light. Also, you cannot record sounds.<br />Bottom line: you'll be glad you gave this camera a shot. Great conversation piece too. Pop in a 128 MB memory stick and you can take up to 244 pictures at 1632x1224! It's just a lot of fun!","Basically, this product could either get a 3 or a 5.  It all depends on the needs of the user.  I recently sold my higher performance digital camera (for which i had bought a couple high quality lenses) and replaced it with the Sony dsc-u20.  The only reason for anyone to give this camera a bad review is because it does not suit their personal needs.  The whole point of this camera is it's size and sexiness.  The common complaints:  no viewfinder, small lcd, no zoom.  These features though (or lack therof for some) are what kept this camera small and sexy.  Bottom Line: This camera can fit anywhere and it looks amazing.  The picture quality is not bad at all.  It boggles the mind to consider the size of this camera, EXCLUDING memory stick and batteries.  If you want to take amazing pictures, get a nice 3 or 4 megapixel sony cybershot with optical zoom.  Keep in mind though, that you wont use your nice full feature camera half as much as this one, as it is ten times as easy to take with you, and it wont discomfort you one bit to have it in your pocket during any regular activities.  Keeping all this in mind, i give this camera a 5.  I can take it anywhere with me and take good pictures.  I never wanted to take my old digital cam with me anywhere because i had to keep it in a case and carry it externally.  This baby can fit anywhere (around your neck even if you feel like looking like a tourist).  Guaranteed to be the sexiest camera you've ever seen.","Sony products has always been known for their style and quality, and this tiny (and I mean tiny) camera is no exception.  Easily fit into your palm, this camera would fit into your pocket without you knowing it's there.  Form factor wise, this camera just can't be beaten.<br />When it comes to quality of photo taken, I found after 3 months of use that outdoor pictures come out near perfect.  The only 2 pictures that I had problem with is in one Chinese Eatery where the light is dim and in weird yellowish colour, and I highly suspect that some of the bigger \"higher MP\" camera would give have given me the same result.<br />This camera does not have zoom, and it does take a while to get used to the fact that you have to bring the camera forward physically.  A camera this small means it is very easy to have covered the lens or the flash without knowing.  But you'd get used to all these and be snapping pictures whenever people least expect it.<br />If you have a normal camera that you find yourself leaving at home most of the time, this camera is for you.  I have it with me almost 24/7.","The main reason for having this stuff is its size. You can put in the pocket or just hang it with strap around your neck. If this can make you happy, this stuff is for you. I thought I'm one, but I'm not.<br />I like to shoot without flash, since some cam flash is not hard enough to light, say a room, and it save power. But this tiny cam can not grap available light good enough to have bright pic, so if you are in low light room, that'll what you get. Do not expect it bright since it doesn't have white balance. Man, I didn't notice it.<br />But if you like to flash, this cam will give you good enough pic when you active its fill in flash mode. It's like you shoot it with no flash. This feature may good enough to think we have what we deserve. But not for me.","I bought this camera mainly for posting pics online, but I also intend to use this camera for my magazine article photos. I wasn't too impressed with the photo quality since the photo compression is pretty high (and it can't be changed), but if you shrink the photos (as you'd need to do anyway to post them on the web) then the quality is just fine. Otherwise, the main selling point of this camera is its size: You can bring it just about anywhere! It turns on quickly and battery life (with the included NiMH) is good. LCD screen is tiny but detailed. Make sure to take night pictures within 6 feet of the cam since it the flash doesn't illuminate much farther than that. Not many in-cam features but they're unnecessary anyway if you know Photoshop. Recommendations after purchasing? Buy a quick battery charge kit (it takes the pack-in charger 13 hours to recharge the batteries!) with extra NiMH batteries, a 128MB memory stick, and a travel case to keep it from getting scratched. Main qualm? It's a bit expensive. But hey, it's a Sony.","You definitely need to hold one in your hands to get just how insanely small it is.<br />All in all an excellent camera. The 8MB stick holds 15 pics at 1632 x 1224, and around 80 at 800 x 600. A 128MB stick would then give you an absurd amount of pics at either res. It conveniently turns on when you open the lens cover; you can do this single-handedly while pulling it out of your pocket, and you'd be ready to shoot as soon as you spot the LCD. The LCD itself, while small, is still very viewable and very good. Transflective, so you can turn off the backlight to save batteries. Batteries do take 13 hours to charge, but the super charger will charge ya a set at around 3 hours. The camera itself is ready to use right off the box; you get the rechargable batteries, the charger, the usb cable, 8MB stick, neck strap thingy and software cd (drivers, image transfer, etc).<br />My only actual compaint is it's inability to get low-light pics. Strangely enough it'll brighten up on the LCD if you've got the flash feature turned off, but the pic itself will be recorded as dark. Granted, if you honestly wanna photograph still life, prone to glare and ruin your shot if flashed at.. you might be better off leaving consumer-level camera county. Although the camera in itself is entirely capable of shooting anything that can be shot at wide angle.<br />Without optical zoom.. you're left with the ultimate point-and-shoot. Extremely small, extremely appealing, very good picture quality, tons of features.","Amazing 2MP camera, lacks optical zoom, but definately compensates in size. If you want something simple for everyday pictures, the u2o is for you.","When I first saw the DSC-U20 at the Sony Style showroom in midtown Manhattan, I was totally awed.  This is definitely the smallest digital camera on the market today, and the styling is superb, making it one of the things you want to own the moment you see it on display.<br />Under the beautiful skin is a capable digital camera, with 1632x1224 resolution (good for prints up to 6\"x4\") and very good image quality.  The small flash does limit its use in dark settings, and the lack of optical zoom sticks out as a disappointment, but considering the typical use for a camera like this -- quick snapshots, party memories, candid exposures -- the overall package is still excellent and the feature compromises understandable.<br />(For the ultra-cool and compact digital camera with optical zoom -- 3X at that! -- I heartily recommend the Minolta Dimage X and Xi, also available on Amazon.com.)<br />The camera's lens, rated at the 35mm equivalent of 33mm (which makes it a wide-angle), is well made, as is the case with all of Sony's cameras.  The camera has center-weighted auto focus with macro capability, and also center-weighted auto exposure.  Shutter speed is rated in the 1/30 - 1/2000 range, typical for consumer-class digital cameras.  The LCD viewfinder measures 1\", which is quite small but still usable to most people except those who need thick reading glasses.  You get a few digital effects (black&white, negative, solarize, soft snap, etc.) when you do feel the creative juice flowing.  You can also take 160x112 MPEG-format video clips, but I find this feature pretty much useless<br />For power the U20 uses two AAA NiMH rechargable batteries.  You can buy these batteries for cheap at Radio Shack, for example, and the camera kit comes with a recharger, although you can buy fancier ones that charge in less time and condition the batteries as well (actual benefit: unknown).  I've taken about 30 pictures, all with flash, so far, and the batteries are still good.  I definitely prefer these batteries to LiIon since 1) NiMH AAA is cheap and sold everywhere, and 2) they hold more power than LiIon and also have more rechargable cycles (i.e., they can be recharged more times).  I'll update the real-world battery life rating once I get a better picture of it.<br />Weighing in at 4.5 ounces with batteries and sporting the \"I'm just cool\" styling of Sony, the U20 is a little digital camera you'll love and carry with you all the while.","This camera is amazing. Is so small that I always carry it with me. The quality of the pictures is really good, and is ready to shot pictures just a couple of seconds after openning the lenses.<br />The two things that I did not like about the camera is that it comes with a very small memory card (8 Mb), so you better buy a bigger one. Another thing is that you can't hook it up to the TV.<br />Since I got this camera I've been taking pictures all the time. All my friends are telling that is an awesome camera. Definetly worth buying :)","then this is the one.<br />For its small size this camera can't be beat.<br />This camera is basically about the size of a pack of bubble gum and is completely functional as well. The flash is powerfull, the camera \"boots up\" instantly, pictures transfer quickly to your computer, the battery life is good and the picture quality is comparable to the canon digital elph. I have used for almost a month now and taken around 300 pictures. Which is 300 more than I took the month before :). There are, however, some people that have had a few bad things to say about this camera. Most complaints I have read such as the \"battery charge time\" are easily refuted. Sony included a cheap battery charger with the package. I picked up a fast NIMH battery charger from an electronics store and some extra rechargeable AAA batteries for  and the problem was solved, case closed. This is my first and will probably be my only review on amazon. I just wanted to share some info on a great camera. I hope everyone found this helpful.","Okay, so it is not as good as a full sized 35mm SLR in the image quality/features department. But for the price, and most importantly the size, it is perfect.<br />The size factor is what sold me on this. After owning an Aiptek Pencam SD for a few weeks, I decided that having a flash would be nice. That was one of the things that drew me to the U20. Being small means it travels everywhere with me. I am now never without a camera. It is so tiny you can't help but take it with you, and if you don't you are doing yourself a great injustice.<br />The image quality is extremely good. Not perfect, mind you, but still excellent. There are a few things I wish it had such as zoom, but that would only end up making the camera big, which defeats the idea behind this dude.<br />The camera is also very easy to use. I did have to consult the manual to figure out how to do some of the things on the menus, and I always pride myself in never reading a manual. But once I saw how to change settings I tossed the book to the side and figured out the rest in about 5 minutes.<br />My one gripe is the 15 second time limit and extremely small image size on video. What is up with that? The Pencam SD is able to capture 640x480 video in one go as long as the batteries hold up. Limiting the user the way Sony has with this cam is pretty dumb in my book.<br />I see no problems at all with \"slow shutter speed\". You push the button and it instantly takes a picture. The only time there is any delay is when it is very dark and the camera is trying to focus - but that happens with all cameras. In normal lighting conditions this thing is every bit as fast at snapping a picture as my Canon A1.<br />This camera rocks.","I wanted a camera that was small enough to fit in my shirt pocket, easy and convenient enough to take quick pictures, and that offered enough extras to make it all worthwhile.  This one does.  I have taken low light, bright light, movies, moving stills, and others and ALL have come out good.  The only thing to be wary about is that you MUST get close to your subject or the subject will be too small in the picture.  It is easy to download the pics to your PC.  I haven't had any trouble and I'd do it again, but I'd demand a case to keep the viewing screen from being scratched this time.","The title says it. A perfect camera is cheap with infinite zoom and perfect quality. Not to mention size. This has the price, the size, and pretty good quality. So its close. The good features are the LCD (small but out of the way), the size (smaller than anything else), the start-up time, the photo effects (negative, sepia, b&w, solarize), and surprisingly good picture quality. The bad is a few dots on one or two of the pictures out of 30 or so, not enough mem comes with it, the difficulty of turning on and off the display, and no zoom (but I dont miss it). There isnt a viewfinder, but the LCD works really well and is small enough to see under any light. In the dark you can see as much as you would in a viewfinder. The point is the Cybershot is small, relatively inexpensive, and has good picture quality to most. I wouldnt exchange for anything else. The size rules. At basketball games or the beach just rip it out of your pocket and youve got a picture 5 sec later.","After looking into other micro-digital cameras, I thought I would take a chance on the SONY because of it's 2MP and other reviews. I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED.<br />Positives:<br />1.The size and weight are impressive and easy to handle.<br />2.Picture taking clear and simple.<br />3.5x7 quality is 5 outdoors and 4 indoors.<br />Negatives:<br />1.No zoom (which I would sacrifice for weight and size).<br />2.Flash limited in distance. Excellent quality indoor pictures up to 8'.<br />Overall:<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for size, weight, quality and ease of us.","This camera takes Brilliant color Pictures.It work for me very well.But i have two only need one easy to carry around.","Sony have done it again - reduced the size and managed to maintain quality to an acceptable level - the camera its' self is a sturdy little number, and simplicity itself to use - the pictures however are not brilliant, unless all variables are good - such as light - used as a 'second' camera, it's worth it's weight in gold - but for good pictures, everytime, spend a little more and get a bigger (Megapixel & size) camera. Want something that is always there and ready to go, this will do you fine - and with a little patience and practice, it WILL produce some great photos - primarily because you always have it on you and it works so fast and so well!<br />Just be aware that it is what it is, and that is an excellent, if expensive, 'snap' camera - think pentax 110 and you won't go far wrong!<br />Despite expectations not being met, I wouldn't trade it for the world - yet?","I wanted a small digital camera to replace my bulky Kodak, and couldn't resist buying the Sony.  It was incredibly small, looked easy to use, and ran on AAA batteries, which I thought would be rather convenient.  When I tried out the camera, however, I was disappointed with the picture quality.  The pictures it took were too dark and rather fuzzy, even when taken in good lighting conditions, using the maximum pixel setting.  I'm only an occasional photographer, but the pictures this camera took did not meet my expectations.<br />It was, however, easy to use, and very convenient, and if Sony manages to improve the picture quality, I'll look at this model again.  For now, however, I'll be returning this Sony for an Elph 2MP camera.","I have been using my new Cyber-shot U camera for several days now and I have to say that overall, this little camera is terrific.<br /><br />All I want to do is to take some pictures, have the immediate gratification of being able to see them immediately, crop them and post them on a website or email them. MAYBE sometimes print them out. I have no intentions of blowing them up to 8x10\". In my entire life I have never blown up a photo that big...biggest I ever got was 4x6, so I'm a little surprised why all of the companies are thumping this 8x10 thing.<br />I played with my friend's 3.2 megapixel Sony camera and I was seriously considering buying a more full featured camera such as that, until I saw and tried this camera.<br />Here is my list of pros and cons:<br />---- The good list ----<br />EXCELLENT SOFTWARE:<br />The software driver makes it *so* easy to transfer images to my computer. The camera comes with a USB cord that you simply plug into the camera, and a \"Removeable Drive\" appears in Explorer. There's one folder for still images, and one folder for MPEGS. This was one of the selling points for me for a Sony camera in general.<br />QUICK INITIALIZATION:<br />As soon as the camera is turned on, its ready to shoot. This is an EXCELLENT feature for those of us who want to be able to capture a real-life image that may not be there for too long. Many other cameras have agonizingly-long initialization processes that can seriously impede many photographic impulses.<br /><br />NON-PROPRIETARY BATTERIES:<br />This camera (like some other Sony models) uses a pair of Nickel Metal Hydride rechargeable batteries. I like the fact that I can go to a non-Sony company and buy extra batteries if I need to. Plus, if I am in a pinch, I can buy alkaline batteries and use them (even though alkalines are not recommended because of how quickly they are drained).<br />MANUAL LENS COVER:<br />The cover to the lens is a manually-operated \"door\" that you slide sideways to reveal the lens. Plus it also turns the unit on when it is opened. I like this feature very much because it allows me to control how quickly I can open the unit, and therefore, how quickly the unit is ready to shoot. I DON'T have to wait for some motor to do it's thing and tell me when it's ready to shoot (like most other digital cameras).<br />And by the way, all of the other cameras I looked at had so many delicate moving parts to their mechanized contraptions that I believed that over time I would have eventually lost a spring and would've had to send it to the manufacturer for repair. Most models have super-small moving parts, especially for the lens. Usually they have tiny little doors over the lens. They are very thin and have springs attached to them. I like the idea that I won't be carrying around something so delicate in my pocket.<br />VERY GOOD PICTURE QUALITY:<br />This is a 2 megapixel camera and takes excellent photos for what I need them for (web). I have taken hundreds of shots and am extremely satisfied with the results.<br />SIZE AND WEIGHT:<br />If you've seen the unit, you'll know. It's very light and very small. It fits easily in my pants pocket. You'd never know it was a camera. I don't know many other cameras that fit into pants pockets easily.<br />GOOD DESIGN:<br />It's very intuitive to use and the features are easy to find.<br />--- The not-so-good list ----<br />SMALL PREVIEW SCREEN:<br />The window is too small to let you know if the shot you took is clear. Definitely one of the weaker aspects.<br />BRIGHT FLASH:<br />The flash is a bit too bright. It tends to have a \"drowning out\" effect for images shot close up. I contrast this to my friends Sony 3.2 megapixel camera that did not have the drowning out effect as much. I muted the flash by taping a piece of white paper over it. So far this is working great.<br />CHARGER UNIT DOESN'T DISCHARGE THE BATTERIES:<br />The camera comes with a charging unit to recharge the batteries, but it doesn't discharge the batteries first. The manual recommends that you should discharge the batteries before recharging, and I suppose this has to do with what I have been reading about Nickel Metal Hydride batteries' slight \"memory effect\" whereby battery life can be shortened depending on when they are recharged.<br />For me, the benefit of having a compact camera is that, before I begin my expedition, I am going to grab a fresh set of batteries, drop them into the camera, and then go. I figure the battery life will last me a day at least, so I don' t need (or want) to carry extra batteries if I don't have to.<br />So, this means that I would have 2 options if I didn't buy a new charging unit that first discharged the batteries:<br />a) carry extra batteries and then switch them out when/if the first ones die, which I don't want to do.<br />b) start with fresh batteries and then when I get home use the camera to discharge the partially charged batteries before recharging them. Let's not forget that the camera has a auto-off feature that turns the camera off after 3 idle minutes. So discharging the batteries can be a real chore.<br />NO ZOOM:<br />There is no zoom. But my non digital camera didn't have a zoom either. This doesn't bother me too much. This could arguably belong in the \"good\" section simply for the fact that simple is better here.<br />BAD MPEG QUALITY:<br />I didn't buy the camera to capture mpegs, and this is icing on the cake. However, the mpeg quality is dismally bad.<br />Overall, I LOVE this camera. It amazes me that Sony was able to put so much into such a small unit.","I just got the U10. It's a little gem that will serve as my new glove box cam. I've used it indoors and outdoors, with and without flash, and I'm very pleased with the pictures I've gotten thus far. I took an experimental movie clip (no sound) and it also looks fine. The 2 megapixel resolution (you can also select lower res for computer/Internet use) is crisp up to and including prints of 8\" x 10\". The camera uses 2 rechargeable AAAs (the charger is included) and the battery life is very good. The included 8 megabyte Memory Stick is too small, but I put a 128 meg (Lexar) card in there. One should get almost 200 pics at its full 2 megapixel setting. Settings and menus are simple and the instruction manual is not needed. The size and weight are of course the big pluses here. I gave it only 4 stars though because I felt the price was a bit high for the specs (obviously, the price is the premium for the size) *and* because without an eyepiece viewfinder, one is forced to frame through the tiny LCD on the camera's rear. That is a nearly impossible task in sunlight, making for a significant drawback. Nonetheless, I'm having fun with it and I'm sure you will too!","Get this camera if all you need is some quick snapshot.<br />Pros :<br />  very compat size<br />  uses regular AAA battery<br />  almost instant-on ( if you don't use 128MB memory stick )<br />  lens cover double as power switch<br />Cons :<br />  noisy picture<br />  image not at sharp/detailed as other cameras at the same price<br />  battery drains quickly ( but you can always bring extra pairs of NiMH rechargeable batts )<br />  the batt charger comes with it is awfully slow<br />Conclusion :<br />Get it , if all you need is a point-and-shoot film camera replacement. Don't forget to buy a faster batt charger and some extra high capacity NiMH batts :)","The Sony Cybeshot DSC-u20 is a fantastic buy and a great little camera. I reolaced my bulky Panasonic Super Disk camera with the Sony and I couldn't be more pleased. The pictures are every bit as good as larger cameras with more mega pixels. You can print an 8 x 10 that is frameable and displayable !<br />I highly recommend this product. It's small enough to fit in your shirt pocket and very easy to use.","Ok, wow....its so small. Just to give you an idea.  Its smaller then a Nokia 8260 phone in length and just a tad bit fatter. The LCD display isn't that big so its still hard to see how the picture turned out.  Always use red eye reduction because (everyone) will have red eyes.  No zoom and video mode is totally useless and grainy.  Taking pictures at night will sometimes give out picture distortions (litte spots on the picture). OH and the battery charger takes 13hrs to charge and I wish sony gave 16 MB memory stick instead of 8MB.  Now with all these complains...how can I give this camera 5 stars???  Well I bought the camera for one thing:the size(ITS SOOOO SMALL). The camera is also ready to take picture as soon as you open it (so you won't miss those sudden funny moments) My other digital camera (Fuji 2650) had a lag time of like 3-5 seconds when I turned it on.  The pictures are clear and distinct.  I wouldn't recommend this as your first digital camera (go with the Fuji 2650 3x optical zoom and same price or cheaper).  I had the Fuji 2650 but I never took it anywhere because its so bulky (compare to this camera).  I also tried the Sony DSC-U10 and the picture quality really stink (1.3 Mega pixels).  Get this camera if you wanna show off or a camera that can be taken everywhere.","This is an excellent \"point and click\" camera.  Its 2megapixels give you what you need -- although 2mp's might not be enough for some people.<br />Two Issues:<br />FIRST thing everyone must know about this camera are the red-eye results.  The flash is RIGHT NEXT to the shutter/lens, making it a great candidate for a lot of red-eye, even with the red-eye reduction capabilities (flash, flash, flash, FLASH).<br />SECOND thing everyone must know is that in a dark setting, the camera takes a 3-4 seconds in addition to the flash charge-time between taking pictures.<br />Overall I'm really happy with it.  I bring this camera everywhere due to its compactness. Honestly, it's smaller than you think. Smaller in size, compared to my Nokia 8390 cellphone, but a bit thicker. And the photo quality for the camera's physical size is great. Although the ISO adjustment in dark settings makes it a bit grainy.","Me gusta mucho esta camara, es muy portatil y toma imagenes de buena calidad","This camera is amazing.  I've only had it for 2 weeks and I love it.  I already have a 3.3 megapixel camera with zoom (Sony DSC-P1) so this was more of a \"pocket\" camera. Just something to throw in my pocket for \"everyday events\" that I want to capture.<br />PROS:<br />1) The size is the biggest - it will fit anywhere.<br />2) Batteries - It takes two AAA (It came with rechargable ones) but in a bind you can get AAA's anywhere.<br />3)  All the features are there (red-eye reduction, index for taken pics, picture effects, etc....)<br />CONS:<br />1)  There is no zoom - if this is going to be your \"first\" digital camera I would consider the somewhat larger but optically more advanced Sony's.<br />2)  2 Megapixels - This is actually good and bad.  2 Megapixs is at the border of a \"good\" picture (IMHO).  On a monitor, they look fine and they can be cropped slightly; but printing large pics or magging up too much gives a pixelly result. On the other hand, my 64 MB card holds over 120 pictures.","As you can see from some of the reviews, this camera gets great marks as something you can always carry, and shoot quickly with.  (The simplicity of the camera reduces the \"shutter lag\" that is so frustrating on some digicams - many digicams miss the shot you want because of a delay between when you press the shutter and when it captures the image.)  With this tiny Sony, you get the benefit of the several generations of Sony design of compact digicams, and Sony's skill at miniaturizing electronics.  For some, this really can be the perfect camera.<br />But there are some big compromises, so make sure this is what you want.  There's no optical zoom, so it's harder to make the most of the somewhat limited pixel resolution by zooming in just the part of the scene you want.  Lack of a viewfinder means you'll drain the battery quicker, and may have trouble seeing what's in the picture in bright sun (which washes out the LCD).  And the optics and flash do suffer on a camera this small.<br />So think about what you need.  This camera will be a dream for some.  But others can get much better quality and lots of useful features - without much more size or cost - in the Sony DSC-P2 or P7.","I just got this as my first digital camera.  I mostly need a camera for when I go out on weekends, and this small size is perfect for my needs.  This easily fits into your pocket and is perfect for group pictures with friends at events/clubs/parties/skiing/canoeing/videogameArcade/horseshoe.<br />I love gadgets, and this is surely one of the best purchases I've made in the electronics department(go get your Samsung s105 phone, handspring treo, t-mobile sidekick, and roomba robovac while you're at it, they'll complete the picture).<br />Make sure you get the quick recharger starter kit, otherwise you will wait 13 hours for the batteries to recharge (as opposed to 1.5 hours).<br />Ths picture quality is excellent.  Great color saturation.  And not like you need more than 2.0 megapixels unless you're some professional photographer (1600x1200 is larger than most desktop resolutions).  For the ... price tag, this camera is STILL worth every penny.  Just don't expect a ton of features (no zoom, no eyepiece viewfinder)... the price is all justified in the size and sony quality you've come to expect.<br />Don't install the software that comes with it (Pixela), it's nothing worthwhile.  Works flawlessly with Windows XP.  GET IT BEFORE YOUR FRIENDS DO !","I bought this camera for my daughter who is 9 yrs old (An expensive present!).. It is more of a fun camera for the quick snap shot which can be downloaded on to your computer by a usb cable.There is no viewing lense just LCD viewer, fits into the palm of your hand, or top pocket . No zoom so not much scope  for enlargement and due to a low pixel only suitable for the standard shot(However Sony Quality). A Quality gimmick not sure if it is a great contender..needs higher pixel or zoom.","If you just want an easily available (shirt pocket set-up)digital camera this is the way to go. The software worked on my no-name 98 box - Apple commercials aside. And, it is easy to use. Once you are passed the initial date seting etc. it is the proverbial piece of cake. The Sony case - don't bother - [$$$] for a case that small is ridiculous. Also, watch what you spend on memory sticks - if you are JPEG'ing it to send e-mails you only need the lowest format. I am happy with it. Would suggest Adobe Photoshop or whatever for editing before sending to friends. One other warning - not for the visually challenged - the 1 inch LCD display is not for folks who have put off a trip to the eye doctor a tad too long.","I just picked up this camera last week and it's great! I wanted a really small camera that I could take with me out on the town. This is a party cam...designed to take spontaneous and random pictures that you can e-mail to your friends. The interface on the camera is so simple...I didn't even have to open the directions. The battery life could be longer but that's what you're sacrificing with the size. I would say that this camera is the perfect companion for someone who does not want to pay a lot for a digital camera and wants decent quality out of it.","This camera works like a charm. The CCD pickup is so sensitive that it blows most 2mp cameras out of the water. When you combine the great image quality with the smallest size of any digital camera out there -- you've got a real winner. Buy this now before the price goes up! You'll be satisfied, I promise."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot G3","amazon_reviews":["I bought this several years ago for stringer work on a local paper.

Used in an orthodontic office to take intraoral dental photos as well as facial photos. Easy to use. Good quality images.","When I bought this camera 3 years ago, it was the advanced \"point-n-shoot\" I had been waiting for. While it's outdated now, it's successors (the most recent is the just-launched G7) have continued Canon's tradition of knowing their users. This camera let's me do nearly everything to which I was accustomed with my film slr. It can be fully automatic, (almost) completely manual (you can't expose the same frame/file multiple times, as in a film camera). It has a choice of metering modes, though no spot meter - however I've rarely found this to be too sore a point). And it let's me be creative and experiments.<br /><br />My main gripes:<br /><br />1. Autofocus is not speedy nor as accurate as as a film slr.<br /><br />2. Battery life is much less than a film camera (as are most digicams).<br /><br />3. It only records up to ISO400, and there's some noise and fringing in the shadows in low light at that speed.<br /><br />4. Lens does not have a fixed maximum aperature, however, at the lens' widest angle max aperature is a robust F/2.<br /><br />5.It now seems a bit clunky, physically.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to upgrading to my first DSLR shortly.

It has never let me down and the battery life is amazing,  requiring only one change during a span of more than seven years.<br /><br />Mine has proven to be well constructed. It's been used in the rain, packed away in luggage, shoved into my purse, taken on roller coasters (used too), and dropped and yet, it's never broken. I do the unthinkable by cleaning the lens with the bottom of my shirt yet the lens remains scratch free.<br /><br />For its day the Canon PowerShot G3 is one of the standouts in terms of durability of construction, battery life, features, ease of use, and picture quality.  Here we are in 2010 with lots of outstanding digital cameras to choose from, but for me there isn't a camera out there that justifies the expense of replacing this one.<br /><br />Thank you my old faithful friend.","Excellent camera. Used in an orthodontic office to take intraoral dental photos as well as facial photos. Easy to use. Good quality images.","When I bought this camera 3 years ago, it was the advanced \"point-n-shoot\" I had been waiting for. While it's outdated now, it's successors (the most recent is the just-launched G7) have continued Canon's tradition of knowing their users. This camera let's me do nearly everything to which I was accustomed with my film slr. It can be fully automatic, (almost) completely manual (you can't expose the same frame/file multiple times, as in a film camera). It has a choice of metering modes, though no spot meter - however I've rarely found this to be too sore a point). And it let's me be creative and experiments.<br /><br />My main gripes:<br /><br />1. Autofocus is not speedy nor as accurate as as a film slr.<br /><br />2. Battery life is much less than a film camera (as are most digicams).<br /><br />3. It only records up to ISO400, and there's some noise and fringing in the shadows in low light at that speed.<br /><br />4. Lens does not have a fixed maximum aperature, however, at the lens' widest angle max aperature is a robust F/2.<br /><br />5.It now seems a bit clunky, physically.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to upgrading to my first DSLR shortly. Can't wait to have the resolution, speed, and lens interchangeability that I so enjoyed on my old Elan.<br /><br />That said, if you're looking for an advanced fixed lens point and shot, don't hesistate to try out the latest in the Canon Powershot line.","I bought my G3 in September of 2003 after my SLR took a dump 3 weeks before my baby was due.  I have NEVER been disappointed.  Granted, if I had the money, I would have gone for something better, but this was the BEST I could have gotten for my money.  Some reviewers have commented on the camera not being worth the price - you must not have shopped around!  I found mine, brand new, for $460 from a reputable online camera store.<br /><br />My pictures turn out great most of the time.  I agree with the slow focus time, but you can't get everything with a prosumer camera.  I love the neverending list of options this camera offers (from flash output to f-stops to white balance, etc. etc.).<br /><br />When I have the money saved up I'll be buying the Canon digital rebel, but until then I am very satisfied with my G3.","I've had my G3 for about 10 months now, and I've taken thousands of pictures with it.  The positives:<br />- Takes great, clear pictures under ideal conditions; often with better results than my 35mm Canon SLR!<br />- Easy uploads to my PC.<br />- Accepts my external Canon flash.<br />- Excellent battery life.  (I've people complain about battery life with other digital cameras, but this really is a strong point for the G3.)<br />- The unique LCD that flips over is \"cool\" (and easy to protect from scratches).<br />- Has lots of shooting modes for a non-pro camera.<br />The negatives:<br />- The lens cap is a poor design; it falls off very easily (at least Canon provides a cord so it doesn't get lost).<br />- Focus is slow except under ideal lighting conditions.<br />- Focus is unreliable; I've learned to take 3 shots at a time, hoping that at least one of them will be in sharp focus.<br />- Photo quality gets noticeably worse (more \"noise\") as soon as you increase the exposure \"speed\" above the slowest setting (ASA 50).<br />- The design is relatively bulky and heavy for a non-SLR camera, and the controls are not ergonomically correct.<br />- The RAW picture format option is useless with this camera because Canon's software gives you virtually no useful options for correcting/modifying photos in RAW format.  To do anything useful you have to take the time to convert your photos to JPG anyway.  I gave up on RAW after the first couple of tries and have stuck with JPG format since then.<br />In summary... I expected a lot at this price level, and the G3 really is a great camera for family snapshots, scenery and documents.  However, it is a poor camera for low-light conditions or action photography.","Did anybody buy this camera from Amazon last two months? Is really new Canon? In how many days from placing of order you get the camera? Thank you.","I did a lot of research last year before I bought this camera... It kinda hurt to leave behind my beloved nikon 35mm SLR, but I was going to Italy, and I needed something smaller, and digital.<br />The photos coming out of this camera are amazing.  The 'auto' feature takes great pictures most of the time, and there's plenty of flexability in the settings to play with if it doesn't work.  And with digital, you're not wasting film if the picture doesn't come out.<br />This camera is also really easy to use, which is wonderful catching those quick photo opertunities.  The only downsides are 1) it's a little slow to actually TAKE the picture... almost a 1 second lag from hitting the button to finishing the shot.  2) This camera can not take action shots.  A childs first steps will be fine, but a soccer game won't work.  To be fair, all point and shoot digitals suffer from the same flaw... to break this, you have to step it up to SLR, and >$1000 in price (though I do lust after that Nikon D70...)","First of all, if you are trying to decide between the G3 and the G5, consider that you would be paying $100 more for the G5 simply because it has an extra mega-pixel, otherwise, the cameras are identical.<br />Now for the praise, this camera is simply amazing for it's price. It has a ton of advanced features and it's incredibly durable. I have dropped it a few times, and accidently got it wet and guess what, it still works. Also, it satisfies pretty much any kind of photographer. Switch to Auto and your grandma can use it, switch to any of the manual settings and it will satisfy the creative photographer. The focus, white balance, aperture, shutter speed, etc, can all be manually altered.<br />Four mega-pixels might seem like a low number considering that high end compact digitals today have 5, 6 or more. But, 4 is more than enough to produce wonderful full-page prints. Also, because it's a 4 megapixel, it processes the photos very quickly, in about a second.<br />Worried that it's not a digital SLR? Well, unless you're a pro photographer, you wouldn't mind simply getting one of the lens attachments such as Wide Angle, Zoom or Micro. I have the Wide Angle attachment I bought from a 3rd party on ebay for $50 and it works great with the camera, it has a built in macro lens as well.<br />Anyway, if you want a compact digital, this is IT. Tons of features, durable, trusted name, ability to get lens attachments and you get awesome full page prints. Get it.","I owned many cameras before but this is my first digital camera.  My experience told me that I should get something which is more reliable and slightly heavier.  I used to own a very light camera but it turned out the results were poor.  Canon G3 has the perfet conditions that I am looking for, unfortunately, it is far too heavy than I thought.  Overall, this is a good camera.  Still, I will say it is a GOOD BUY.","I bought this in September 2003 and am extremely satisfied with its performance.  Originally I thought of getting a G5 but decided against it after reading negative reviews on [...] which by the way is an excellent source of digital camera information.  Apparently the G5 suffers from severe purple fringing due to trying to \"push\" the abilities of its small CCD sensor to its limits.  The effect is also apparent in a lot of other 5MP cameras that still use a 1/1.8\" size CCD.<br />Anyway the G3 is extremely great!  Image quality is extremely high and since I don't print anything larger than A4 size, I don't need anything more than 4 megapixels.  Controls are very intuitive but browsing through the manual helps to learn a lot of the advanced features.  There are a lot of extra stuff that can definitely enhance one's photo experience (for example, there's a built-in neutral density filter to darken bright scenes and help saturate colors more).  There is also an optional lens adapter that lets you attach 58mm filters (something available on Canon's \"A\" series Powershots as well).  In fact, short of not having an interchangable lens, the G3 is practically a baby SLR camera!  Size, though it bothers some people, is not a problem for me because it actually gives the G3 a good feel in the hand.<br />If you need the extra pixels, I suggest you skip the G5 and go straight for Canon's new Digital Rebel (EOS-300D).  Otherwise the G3 is an excellent performer for everyday use with a heaping of extra creativity when needed.  I now intend to get my G3 housed for underwater use, sell off my Nikon 35mm camera & kit, and continue to purchase Canon's photo & imaging products.<br />Conclusion: if you are after a non-SLR type digital camera and will be doing more than point-and-shoot, I highly recommend the Powershot G3.  This may not be the camera to put in your pocket, but it will produce much, much higher quality images than any other non-SLR digital camera in the market.","My beloved G2 was stolen - so I bought the later version from Canon - the G3. Granted, the specifications have improved, but the quality and refinement have suffered. Now when viewing through the viewfinder, the main lens is clearly visible and somewhat off-putting. More seriously, the lens cap itself does not stay on the lens.<br />Routinely, the flash fails to operate or the pictures are out of focus because some special setting has been triggered - and finding out what setting did it is nigh on impossible to locate. Unfortunately, most of the time, one is unaware of the shooting problem until viewing the finihsed pictures - waay to late to do anything about the problem.<br />I wish I had my G2 back - and would happily swap my G3 for a G2 (in like (like new) condition).","There is absolutely nothing bad I can say about this camera.  I've owned one for about 8 months and it continues to exceed every expectation.<br />From the clarity of shots taken at max zoom (even at night), the video clips, the sound bites added to pics, to the battery life.... Everything about this camera has impressed me.<br />This Camera Rocks!!!","The G3 is simply an amazing digital camera.  It offers all of the creative features a serious photographer could ask for, in a camera that when set to automatic, is simple enough for anyone to use.<br />The fast lens means that the flash isn't needed as often as with other cameras, while the hot shoe allows an external flash for when flash is needed.  External flash is ALWAYS better than built-in, especially one with bounce capability (the Canon 420EX is a great companion to the G3).<br />The Powershot G3 is NOT small and light enough to dissappear into a pocket, but that is part of what makes it such a terrific camera.  If you want a carry anywhere model, look at the Digital Elph or the S45/S50, which are much smaller and have built-in lens caps.  The G3, on the other hand, is made for using, not carrying.  That's not to say that its heavy and large, it is actually about the same size as most 35mm point and shoot cameras of the early 1990s.<br />The larger size is what makes the G3 great.  It has a proper hand grip, that fast 4X zoom lens (physically a lot larger than the slow 3X lenses on other Canon cameras) and a large, tilt-swivvle LCD.  There are also enough buttons, dials and controls to make all of the G3's many features easy to access and use, rather than burrying them deep in the menu system.<br />Some users complain that the lens barrel can be seen in the optical viewfinder when set to wide angle.  Yes, it can be seen, and no, it isn't that big of a deal.  If you've ever used a 35mm rangefinder camera you are probably familiar with this effect, and if you haven't, it isn't at all hard to get used to.<br />Finally, the 4 megapixel resolution and accurate color balancce make for incredible images.  Automatic does a terrific job in most conditions, and when it doesn't, or you just want to be creative, you have more options with this camera than almost anything else on the market.<br />I also own the 5 megapixel S50 as my compact camera.  I was concerned when I bought it that I would favor it over the G3 on account of hte higher resolution, however I just printed some 11X14s from both cameras, and resolution is not an issue on either one.  I see the extra resolution simply as more room to crop, which can make up for the S50 having a 3X as opposed to 4X zoom lens.  With the G3, I have more control over composition in the camera, doubly so as I also have the 17X Canon teleconverter.  With the functional equivalent of a 285mm lens on a 35mm camera, I honestly don't need much cropping, whereas the S50 is limited to 105mm and I often crop more.  Color saturation and accuracy are excellent on both cameras, and both are tack-sharp without any noise, at least if left at ISO 50 or 100 as I always do.<br />In conclusion, I love the G3, and give it my highest recommendation.","I bought the G3. It is my first digital camera. Am so glad I decided to purchase this particular model. It is incredibly easy to use as a point and shoot camera, yet, on the other hand allows a lot of depth for more advance photo shooting. The results so far have been nothing short of astounding. The picture quality is wonderful, particulary without the flash (both indoors and outdoors.)  I was not able to directly hook up the G3 with my computer due to multiple USB devices. Probably could have figured it out, but instead I purchased a very inexpensive card reader which works perfectly. Immediately purchased a 256 mb card...and now I am ready for some serious picture taking.  This is a wonderful entry level camera which will grow with the new user. Particulary impressive so far has been the long lasting battery. In fact, so far I have not gone to the limits of the battery! Last week I took 65 successive pictures at an event at our church and still had battery left.","Can't say enough about this camera!  I am a real novice at photography and I love this camera.  It is very easy to use and the pictures are so crisp and clear.  Very easy to download to PC.  Only con would be that it's a little heavy.  Other than that, this is a wonderful camera!","This is my very first digital camera, after using a 35mm camera for over 18 years, and I love it, love it, love it!  The camera is easy to use and operate.  I take (admittedly amateur) photographs of buildings and urban landscapes and need to be able to adjust aperture and exposure.  This camera has simple controls that allow you to easily do that.  I immediately took this camera on a trip abroad and had fun taking picture after picture.  I still have to figure out how to help the camera focus on very faraway, difficult to see objects (I tried taking a picture of my hometown from a plane in the late evening and it took the camera a while to find the right focus).  Downloading of pictures on a USB port is very easy.  Over all, I am very happy with my purchase and recommend it to anyone who wants a little more than just a snapshot camera but can't afford a real professional camera.","This camera is wonderful!<br />Originally bought it to photograph my children but found it to be a priceless gem for my business (Assistantforyou.com).<br />One of the services I use this camera for is supporting Real Esate Professionals and photographing their client homes for listings.<br />This camera is great and offers a wide variety of options from still shots to 30-second video with audio!  Switching from one to another shot form is easy and quick!<br />Love it and highly recommend it!","The PowerShot G3, a substantial optical & electronic upgrade from the already excellent G2, has now come into the \"Good Value\" range, with the arrival of the (nearly identical) G5 version. The G3 and the G5 are physically and optically identical - save for the G3's silver case that now comes in black. For the few extra hundred bucks you get a 5 MP rather than a 4 MP camera - a difference that's essentially indistinguishable except with poster sized prints. I opted for the far less costly G3 and have been delighted. The lens (4X zoom) is first class; the battery lasts for hundreds of shots between charges; the swivel LCD has gorgeous colors and is very solidly hinged; you can use it as a point-and-shoot with great results, yet have dozens of manual adjustments available if you desire more control; the macro feature (down to 2\" proximity) and the neutral density filter (to reduce exposure of very bright scenes) are worth the extra money alone.<br />The one con is that the big lens obscures a corner of the optical viewfinder at the wide-angle setting -- but that's why you have an LCD viewer anyhow. Well worth paying a bit more than for a simple handheld camera; beatifully crafted, with excellent printed and illustrated manuals and first-class software.<br />ADDENDUM: The current Powershot G5, a G3 in black drag with a 5 MP rather than a 4 MP CCD sensor, has received consistent criticism for showing chromatic aberration (\"haloing\") and digital noise when compared with the G3; probably because the higher density CCD feeds into the same electronics processing package as the G3. All the more reason to purchase the G3 - if you still can find one. The 20% increase in pixel count makes no perceptible difference (unless you print 11x15\" banners), and the image quality has declined in the makeover; even so, the black body does look more professional (but is that worth the extra bucks?).","I recently got this camera as an upgrade from my Canon S200. I am very happy with my S200 believe me but after shooting with my G3 I am amazed at the detail and color I can now get.<br />I was wondering if the G3 was worth the price jump over the G2, my only reason for this was the body design of the G3 which seems more modern to me. I know this is superficial but it looks nice.<br />The first thing I noticed was how similar the controls / icons were from the S200, so it wasn't a steep learning curve on known features. But these are some of the manual features the G3 offers:<br />-P/ Program AE Mode: G3 sets shutter speed and aperture, you set ISO speed, light metering<br />-TV Mode: G3 sets aperture, you choose shutter speed, ISO white balance.<br />-AV Mode: G3 sets shutter speed, you choose aperture, ISO, white balance<br />-M Manual Mode: You set shutter speed and aperture.<br />-Auto mode: auto.<br />-C1 and C2 modes: these are modes on the dial along with the others which let you save your own custom settings. This was cool because now I have a space for lmy own ow light setting and my own high speed setting, which i just turn the dial to get.<br />Some other Pros I wanted to list about the G3:<br />-LCD screen is beautiful, nice large, crisp.<br />-Movie mode (320x240 max) lasts 3minutes, and plays back on the G3 with sound.<br />-the two buttons needed for deleting images are right by each other, so you only need a thumb to delete. (dumb I know, but I delete alot on the fly) actually all of the buttons are placed thoughtfully.<br />-wireless remote, is cool for shooting group shots.<br />-macro mode is awesome, have gotten some very nice shots of flowers...etc<br />-longest shutter speed is 15 seconds.<br />-image sizes the G3 has, with images each size allows, based on a 256mg CF card, on medium compression:<br />2272x1704, 221 images<br />1600x1200, 439 images<br />1024x768, 760 images<br />640x480, 1560 images<br />RAW 64, images<br />All in all, I am very happy with the camera and the purchase. Definately not one of those you will feel guilty about treating yourself to, because that's how I feel. There are other features which I have probly missed. But these were the ones I noticed at first.<br />If you are looking at cameras and thinking about it, get the G3, its easy enough to use as an amateur. You won't be dissapointed.<br />Have fun, cheers. (Oh, my pics are on pbase.com/flashboy99)","Recently purchased the Canon G3.  Decided to purchase the G3 over the G5 because they were so similar and the savings was substantial.  The pictures are magnificent!  The camera is very easy to use...even for a novice.  The only negative thing about the camera is what most other people have found with the lens cap and the viewfinder.  The viewfinder doesn't bother me because I always use the LCD screen.  Canon should consider putting a better lens cap on!!  I guess if that is the only thing you can find wrong with a camera then it must be an excellent piece of equipment.  Would not hesitate to suggest the purchase of the Canon G3 to anyone.  Hope you all enjoy yours as much as I do mine.","I bought this camera a few weeks ago and have been shooting like crazy ever since.  I've had enough time to feel comfortable with all the features, and I'm just amazed at the things this camera is capable of.<br />The images are sharp and the colors knock your socks off.  You can saturate the colors or not, depending on preference.  The buttons on the top and back of the camera make quick access to most of the features a snap, so you don't have to dive into the menu for them.  Much better than my old Olympus D40 for this.<br />  The flip out and twist lcd screen is absolutely a gem, and it feels like it has the sturdiest hinge ever.  I don't think I would buy a camera without this ever again.  The focus bracketing feature is incredible for macros, and unique among cameras.  The battery life is astounding.  I have never run it down yet, even after 275 pics shot one day, and I always leave the lcd on.  The built in neutral density filter let me shoot flowing water with a smooth, silky appearance for the first time ever.  That's fun.<br />I love the lens, the ability to add on tele and wide angle converters later, the off camera flash ability.<br />The one glitch is manual focus, but this is a problem for almost all non SLR digicams.  They need to refine this for sure.  Chromic aberration is not a problem once you remember to avoid the widest apertures in backlit shots.<br />I highly recommend this for the photographer who wants to explore the manual aspects of photography.  The thing about it is, many folks won't think they'll ever go beyond point and shoot, but then they get hooked on it and wish they had a camera with more features.  This camera has them in spades.","One word to describe this camera...Wow!  The G3 is more on the expensive side of the spectrum, but it is definitely worth the investment.  I would consider myself to be an amateur photographer, but I could never really take high quality photos.  After taking a weekends worth of pictures at the standard default resolutions, I loaded the pictures onto my PC and was absolutely blown away by how nice they were.  The quality of the image, the resolution, and the color were all breath-taking.  From close-up head shots to landscape shots, they were all the kind of pictures that you looked at and just said \"Wow, that's a really nice picture.\" The combination optical/digital zoom is pretty impressive as well and is more than you will likely need (I could zoom in and read license plate numbers from cars parked in the background). So I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking to improve the pictures they take...you definitely won't be disappointed.  Aside from that, the software was easy to install and surprisingly well designed, camera interface is fairly easy to understand, workmanship of the camera is high quality (doesn't feel like a toy).  It is a little larger than most digital cameras, which I actually like.  It would probably be a tight fit into a small pants pocket, but fits easily in a larger cargo pocket.<br />Only bad sides were that 1)The CF card that comes with it is a paltry 32Mb, so look into getting something bigger and 2)Doesn't come with a case.  For $500+ you would think they could throw in a case, but I guess that's how things go nowadays.","I bought the Canon PowerShot G3 as a gift for my husband based on all the good reviews.  He LOVES it!  I was searching for something fairly easy to use that produced great results, and this camera fit the bill. He took it out of the box and was taking pictures before he ever read the instructions.  He did read the instructions before he loaded the pictures on the computer, but had no problems with anything.  We are now purchasing a larger capacity CompactFlash Card so we can take it on vacation.  The 32 MB card that comes with it is just too small.","I have only had this camera for one full day and I have to say that it is wonderful. the photo quality is amazing and i know i'm going to have fun with all the features. I've figured out most of its features on my own already (because i have used digital cameras before, so i know things like symbols). i'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top, but that doesn't stop me from loving this camera. the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can't get an accurate adjustment (for those of you who don't know what a diopter adjustment is, it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight.) I am going to have so much fun with this camera and when I learn more I will post a more accurate review.","I have only had this camera for one full day and I have to say that it is wonderful. the photo quality is amazing and i know i'm going to have fun with all the features.

Excellent range of metering options as well. It's great to be able to toggle between the metering evaluation settings and see the results of the changes on the LCD screen.<br />2) 4MP is about right for the target market of this camera (semi-serious amateur photographer)<br />3) 4x zoom is nice<br />4) The great thing about digital, in general, is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the LCD screen BEFORE or RIGHT AFTER you take a picture, not two weeks later when you get the film developed.<br />5) Its focusing system is also very flexible. you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button, and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus.<br />---------------<br />NEGATIVES<br />1) Quite bulky (it's about the same size as my Minolta Vectis S-1 APS SLR) and uses a heavy battery.<br />2) Not very ergonomical - you'll find yourself stretching your fingers in the weirdest ways to get to some buttons (especially the flash toggle and exposure evaluation buttons at the top-left of the back)<br />3) Len's aperture is not very flexible (it seems that it's range is very small, even for a point-and-shoot lens)<br />4) The viewfinder is borderline worthless and, inexplicably and ridiculously, the lens blocks part of the viewfinder at the wide-angle. I wish it were larger and brighter so I could use it when taking pictures in bright daylight when the LCD screen is hard to use because of the brightness.<br />5) Its swiveling LCD screen is as convenient as it is annoying.","The camera has a wonderful set of features. The LCD screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures. You can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the LCD. The optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry. The highest optical zoom pictures are perfect. I have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures (purple fringing, etc) so I am very pleased. The Canon computer software used to download, sort, upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use. The only two minor issues I have with the camera are the lens cap (it is not very snug and can come off too easily) and the lens itself (it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the LCD). The menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use. It is a fantastic camera and well worth the price.","Recent price drops have made the G3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available. Advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable. Newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box. 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome. Don't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype. Unless you want to print murals, you don't need it. Those used to 35mm cameras will find the G3 very comfortable and friendly to use. Anyone looking for more than \"point and shoot\" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference. The extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it's class. I expect the G3 will please me for years to come.","I recommend unreservedly the Powershot G3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period! It gives great pictures, the controls are easy to use, the battery lasts forever on one single charge, the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing.<br />I began taking pics as soon as I got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos I have took simply by using the AUTO mode...absolutely breathtaking.<br />I was considering the Olympus Camedia C-5050 but was convinced to buy the G3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out. The Olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the Canon, but one of the features that sold me on the G3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the Canon G3.<br />I would recommend a larger compact-flash card, at least 128 MB. I bought a 512 MB card by Simpletech and it works great with my Canon.<br />In short buy this camera if you are thinking about a digital camera in the [expensive] range","What else can you say about a camera that works for both of you? I make photographs at work, and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what I use professionally. At the same time, I wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons.<br />I recieved the camera, inserted a larger CF card, charged the battery, and handed it to my wife. I showed her how to turn it on, where the lens zoom lever is, and she loves it!<br />This camera has Canon's great colorimetry, plus what you see in the LCD is what you get. The prints are beautiful! And you get about 120 images on a 256MB card at highest quality.<br />I tried out some other brands in the stores, and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company; plus what you see in the LCD (no optical finder) isn't what you get - not even for color; the output was less than I expected.<br />Although Canon's batteries are proprietary, they last a really long time, recharge fairly quickly in the camera, plus if you want 'more power', you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on Amazon.","This is a great camera for you! The Canon G3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an \"auto\" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use. I can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos!<br />I love having the option to manually control the F-stop, shutter speed and even focus. I was able to take great photos of the 4th of July fire works, and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers. WARNING - I did read the manual! But if you've used a SLR 35mm camera, the controls are very intuitive! Once I read the manual I was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located. With a quick spin of the dial you can select Shutter priority (for high speed subjects), aperture priority (for focal length) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality. The manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options.<br /><br />It doesn't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can't access them quickly when you need them!<br /><br />This camera also has a great feel and weight to it. You feel like you are holding something of substance, not some cheap plastic toy. The more I work with it, the more I love it!<br /><br />I would recomend that you purchase a Lexar media CF for the camera as the SanDisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow!<br /><br />I didn't think I would find this quality and ease of use for under $900- I'm thrilled with my purchase!","Just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has. Takes EXCELLENT photos.  Night mode is clear as day.  I have not played with all the features yet, but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it.  The only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens.  However, using the LCD seems to eliminate this minor problem.  Overall it is the best camera on the market.  I give it 10 stars!","This camera has significantly more noise at ISO 100 than the Nikon 4500.","I just bought the camera a few days ago. Before I \"get used to it\", here are my first feelings:<br />a) the picture quality (color and sharpness of focusing) are so great, it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time:-))<br />b) the lens cover is surely loose, I already accidently finger-printed the len a few times, and I think I know why it's made that way: because once the camera is in shooting mode, the len will extend out, if the len cover is tight, it would block the len movement and cause potential damage. I wish Canon would work out some way for that issue. The zooming lever is shaky, I hope it does not operate mechanically, otherwise you'll feel uneasy.","i bought this last week through amazon.. got a great deal from a reputable seller. i love this camera. i am still trying to figure out the may options it has. took hundreds of pictures and they were great. great colors, pictures and white balance. has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range. it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for.","Maybe it is my lack of experience, but I found shots with this camera very disappointing.  It was(I sold it after a few months) too expensive for the shots that I got.  Sure it had all the features, but when I tried to shoot a girl's basketball game it just wan't up to the task.  I don't think I was asking too much.  Any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort.  And with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera.  I found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust.  I wanted it to shoot concerts as well.  That meant even less light and just as much action.  Sure, I adjusted the film speed to 400.  The grain was terrible.  Next time I set it at 100 and used the flash.  Well flash photos are never great, and there was still a lot of noise.<br />When I took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects weren't moving, the photos were awesome.  The camera was a marvel.  Getting the printer to help output them was another tale.<br />Overall I think that you need to consider what you wan't to do.  For simple point and shoot photography, consider a cheaper digital.  You don't need the extra resolution or the cost.  Then again a one time use camera may do just as well.  If you  shoot in lots of light and desire high quality, this will be your camera.  It is versatile and seems to be one of the best.  Me, I am going with a Leica Minilux( the G3 was replacing mine which was stolen).  Sure. it is less versatile, but I am never disappointed with the output.","I am a long-time user of highly responsive film SLRs and professional quality external flash equipment, just so you know my bias. I have been watching the development of digicams for years, waiting to make my first move. What I really want is a $1,500 digital SLR with a full frame sensor that will take my Nikon lenses. I figure that is at least three years off, and I am getting impatient. Hence I decided to spring for a \"point-and-shoot\" digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations. I chose the G3 because of its reputation for very high quality, clean images.<br />The two limitations I knew I would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks (even in bright light), and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash. As of this writing, technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film SLR. At least once you've got focus lock, the shutter release lag time for the G3 is about 1/10 of a second, which from what I've read, is better than just about anything else available. What makes the focus-lock lag time something I can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8. Once I get focus lock, I can then wait until my restless subject (a pet or a child) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus.<br />Now what about the flash problem? Relative to what I can easily achieve with external flash on my Nikon SLR, the internal flash on the G3 produces harsh, flat images with ugly hot spots. Fortunately, the G3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash, and fortunately for me, I already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy: the Metz 60 CT-4. I can't use my Nikon external flash on a Canon camera, but I CAN use my Metz, with the proper Metz module and extension cord connected between the G3 and the 60 CT-4. For those who have this Metz flash (or the 45CL-3) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this G3, the Metz module you need is the SCA 3102 and the connector cord is the SCA 3000C.<br />In order for this to work, you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself. Contrary to what I've read elsewhere, the G3 DOES sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes, just as it does with the dedicated flashes from Canon. You also have to set the G3 to second shutter sync, which is what you'd want to do most of the time anyhow. Then just forget about all the controls you have on the Metz flash head itself and the SCA 3102 control panel, because they are all IGNORED. The G3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the Metz flash, and most of the time, the exposure is spot on and when it isn't, it's because you've exceeded the range of the Metz flash itself. This might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing, or if you ARE bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away. Unfortunately, the neutral density filters for the Metz flash are no longer available, so the first problem can't easily be solved. The second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the Metz (with the attendant shadows unfortunately). But once you've got your exposure within an acceptable range, the G3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that I can hardly get with my Nikon F100 film camera. The 60 CT-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted, enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you. The results are shadow-free images that look as if they've been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine.<br />Now there is one more complaint I have about the G3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images (I only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing I did was replace the 32 MByte CF with a 512 MByte CF, which gives me 130 raw images, as opposed to 7!). The Canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image AT ALL, but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera. I believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information. Maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software, you'd see the true, raw image that the camera actually produces. I didn't wait to experiment. Instead, I bought the Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw plug-in. What this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw G3 hardware. Without any tweaking at all, if the exposure is accurate, the colors are as realistic as I've ever seen produced by film, and this is a raw image! The Adobe Camera Raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software. What the G3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical. What the Photoshop plug-in gives you is REALITY, and then if you want fantasy, you can use Photoshop to create it. But at least you're starting with the most photorealistic images I've ever seen from a camera. I am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images I am getting from this G3 (in conjunction with my professional flash system), and can easily put up with the camera's limitations, because I've never seen anything better within its resolution limits.","I've had this for 3 months now, and I am pleased with my decision.  This is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well.  My girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that I had to pry it out of her hands most of the time.  Battery life, the drawback to most digital cameras, to quote K. Reeves...whoa.  Manual functionality is excellent, downloading pictures is quick and a breeze, and the quality is astounding.<br />I did a good month's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras, and this IS the best buy for the buck.  Not perfect (yes, the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances...but the lcd works well enough in those instances), not the cheapest 4.0 mp, but the best 4.0 mp.  If you don't believe me on that, check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there.  Or save time and just do it, you won't regret it.","I recently purchased the Canon PowerShot G3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase.  The Camera is very easy to use, in fact on a recent trip this past week I was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group.  After I took their picture with their camera, they offered to take a picture of us. I just told them, press halfway, wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way.  They fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely.  (As all of my pictures have thusfar).  A few of my work constituants owned the G2 and highly recommended the Canon for picture quality. I'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet (super fine). Ensure you get a larger flash, 128 or 256, some are selling with the larger flash, 32MB will do in a pinch but you'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4MP cameras.  Bottom line, well made camera, easy to use, very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense/filters choices.  I'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like.  Great job Canon!","Being a great fan of the G2 I set out with G3 with a somewhat negative expectation, difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as 'perfect' as the Powershot G2. But Canon never fails to amaze. Some of the great gains over G2 --<br />1. The ability to selectively switch to RAW format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility.<br />2. Battery life is over 4.5 hours, compared to about 2.5 hours for the G2 or the 2 hours for most Nikons.<br />3. The Remote Capture and FileViewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing. Looks sort of like Picasa Software (google it if you dont know) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as G2's, but more intuitive.<br />4. The shape of this device is a little squarer, without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking. A big plus in my book.<br />5. The 1/200 sec, F5.6 + ND filter for highly exposed (or very brightly lit) environments. The light auto-correction is awesome. You could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right.<br />6. The G2's \"Color Effect\" exposure mode has now been removed, the replacement is a selectable \"Effect FUNC\" menu option available in all exposure modes. There are six default settings (Off, Vivid, Sepia, Neutral, Low Sharpening, B&W) as well as a 'Custom Effect' that allows you to control sharpening, contrast and saturation.<br />7. A new PhotoStich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view. I can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera. (Looks quite neat too suggesting that Canon may have, er, Canonized it a bit).<br />8. Perhaps inspired by the Canon's factory white-correction settings (which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out), the G3 has much sharper white offsets. In English, this means that even straight out of the box, you'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking.<br /><br />9. In dim lit environs the G2 could easily outperform any other camera, and thankfully G3 maintains this rep. Personally I believe it even outperforms the G2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors.<br />Overall, the G3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current >4 megapixel digicams, from a detail, tonal balance and color response point of view. There's really very little about G3 images to criticize. Short of the EOS range from Canon or the D100s from Nikon (both SLRs) this is quite simply the best you can ask for.","When shopping for digital cameras I looked at the Nikon CP5700, Olympus C5050, Nikon CP5000, and the Canon G3.  Yes, all cameras except G3 were 5mp but I was looking for a lot more than just Megapixel power.<br />Not only was I was shopping for a camera that would suit MY casual and artistic photographic needs, I had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well.  Her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use.<br />The Nikon's are great cameras.  + They have great optics (CP5700 has great optical zoom)and features, not to mention take great pictures.  - The drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer, the LCD screen is a little too small, CP5000 does not take photos in RAW format.<br />Olympus C5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body. + Takes sharp 5mp photo's, has great features and relatively easy to use.  - I didn't care much for the tilting LCD screen, it seemed very limited and not very usefull. Photos had some artifacts and noise.  My fiance just didn't like the way it felt in her hands.<br />We also looked at the Fuji FPs602.  Nice Camera but doesn't take as sharp as pictures I thought they would, and again... fiance didn't like the feel.<br />The Canon G3... 4mp, 4X optical zoom, takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras, easy to understand and use (has a great swivel LCD screen), a LOT of features and add-on options, comes with great software (not to be overlooked), and last but by far not least, received my fiance's stamp of approval (two thumbs up!)<br />A LOT of research went into digital camera's before I made this purchase, and hands down, the G3 had everything I needed plus more.  The other cameras were great and I'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations, but to each his/her own.  I have no buyers remorse with this baby, and I never will.<br />Always remember, cameras don't take great pictures, people do!","The Powershot G3 is a great camera.  Why?  Because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos!  4 Megapixels is plenty for all but pros, and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera. It's slightly lighter than the G2 and packed with even more features.  Make sure you get a big CompactFlash card (it comes with a 32MB) -- the 512MB cards are pretty [inexpensive] here on Amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time!","The catch with the Canon G3 camera, (and perhaps all of digital cameras) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots. Prior to the purchase, none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture. No one told me, but I wanted to tell you. This is not the same thing as a film camera.  And while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs... they haven't got all the bugs worked out just yet.<br />Most of the time, my G3 is a well-behaved camera. But once in a while, I run up against it's major flaw: It sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time AFTER you press the shutter button.  I am not talking milliseconds.  Picture this: Your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board, so you compose the shot and wait for your moment. When it arrives, you press the shutter release. Splash! The moment passes, and THEN your new G3 camera takes the shot.<br />Perhaps there is a way around this delay.  Some feature I could turn on or off, or some attachment I could get... Yes, I push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay. Yes, I have red-eye off, and yes, I've tried adding a flash. But after trying many adjustments, the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera.  I own another Canon - an EOS (35mm film) camera. It focuses in a snap. Dim or bright, it would never take a picture AFTER the birthday candles had blown out, AFTER the Tae Kwon Do kick broke the board... Canon's G3 does it consistently.  It feels slow to focus, and unbearably slow to shoot.  I challenge anyone (who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon) to say it is fast and responsive.<br />And so I must ask, what are cameras for? What task do they perform?<br />Cameras capture moments. They stop time. Because once the moment is gone, it is not coming back. The dive, the kick, the blow-out-the-candles moments are, to me, the reason for cameras. A 35mm film camera captures the moments you want, while these digital cameras (my friends now inform me) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture. Not all the time, but often enough to be a real problem.  Like I said, when the moment is gone, it is GONE.<br />So buy the G3.  Buy it for fun, for lack of processing, because you want to use iPhoto, or whatever.  But do not assume, as I did, that the G3 has the same ability as [your current film camera] to stop the moment YOU choose.  From a dime store disposable to a top of the line EOS, all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to.  Unfortunately, this digital moment-capturing device called the G3 sometimes captures the moment AFTER the one you wanted.","This is my first digital camera and I couldn't be happier.  I have but plan on selling my Rebel Ti and all of the equipment with it.  I love the quality of the pictures.  They look fantastic.  I can take better pictures with this then my Rebel Ti with a good lens.  It's just easier for me since I can make on the fly adjustments.","The Canon G3 is perhaps the best 4MP camera out there.  I've tried the Sony S85 with the Carl Zeiss lens, but the pictures were too digital.  With Canon, you get pictures that appear to be photos, not still camcorder shots.  I love the EOS based controls and easy menus.<br />I don't need to go into exhustive review of this camera.  Many before me have done that already.  I agree with the positive reviews.  But there are two things I don't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews.<br />1) The included lens cap is very loose on the camera.  Though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display \"lens\" when the cap and the camera are both on, the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself. I'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap, I may damage the lens.  Very cheaply made.<br />2) The body construction - buttons, casing, etc, are too prastic.  The G2 was better in this respect.  It had a heavier and more sturdy casing.<br />Despite these grieps, I still recommend the camera.","Yep. This is my first Digital Camera, and what a 'toy' it is!!! I am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy, I spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera; and i must say, G3 worth every single cent i spent on it.<br />Just a little overview, PowerShot G3 is the flagship of Canon's PowerShot series and its an SLR-like camera, its 4 megapixel and (alsmost) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance. Whether you are a novice or an expert, its ease of use and functionality goes together. + you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes, etc. As its 4MP, you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies (you can record 3 minutes of video). I am using Kingston 512MB CF which works great and is very fast. A good choice could be CF type II, Microdrives that can store around 1 GB of images.<br />Some things that i didn't like (but hey.. nothing is perfect).<br />* Main dial is not backlit.<br />* Lens visible in optical viewfinder. (well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans) use LCD instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too.<br />Overall I'm happy with my toy. :)","I used a Canon Powershot S20 for about 2.5 years and LOVED it!  There were a few flaws that I learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world, losing a few that I really regretted.  I finally decided to upgrade, and started my research.  Canon was an obvious choice, but I did not want to limit my decision, so started researching all brands that would take my Microdrives.  I researched, held, tested, and observed 3 different brands.  Needless to say, the Canon won, hands down.  This camera performs like I can not believe!  I bought it for my trip to Beunos Aires, and also used it at the Iguazu Falls, and could not have asked for more perfect performance!!!  It was too new to have learned much about the advanced features, so I generally used the Auto mode.  This camera is worth every penny, and I highly recommend it!  Another point of note: the battery life is incredible!!  I did not have a backup battery, and had no need for one.  I did have ability to charge it every night, so don't know how long it would have actually gone before dying.  This camera will stay with me for YEARS!!<br />5 Month Update:<br />I am still loving my camera!  Took it to Croatia (very humid), Cannon Beach (very humid), with NO problems!  I was worried from a couple of reviews I had read, but experienced no problems.  The pictures I have taken are INCREDIBLE, with exceptional detail.  I still have NO regrets.  Many manual settings that I still need to figure out (or maybe not).  I LOVE MY CAMERA!!!!!!!","You can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions.<br />I was perfectly happy with my G2, so why did I trade up to the G3? Because this camera is beautiful. The G2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely.  The G3 looks like a work of art! Its silver magnesium finish is stunning, and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera I've seen. The little digital Elphs were the best-designed, most-elegant cameras until the G3 came along and squashed them.","This is my first digital camera. IÕm very pleased with it so far. I wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that IÕd wind up leaving it at home all the time. This seemed like a really good compromise. I compared it to the Olympus C5050z, the Sony DCS-F717 and the Nikon 5700. Based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews, this one seemed like the best all round deal. ItÕs not perfect though. Here are the shortcomings IÕve noticed so far: It would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera. You can see the lens barrel in the view-finder. (I knew this before hand, and itÕs not THAT bad) There is no TIFF format. That would be a nice compromise between JPEG and RAW. To save a picture as RAW, you have to have the display on, this seems like a waste of battery power. It seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete thereÕs quite a lag before the ÒshutterÓ trips. (Again this is my first digital camera and maybe thatÕs just how they all are.) For those of you using a Mac in OS X+ there is no Twain utility to download your pics directly into Photoshop. ItÕs very simple to import via iPhoto 2 and then move them to Photoshop. I havenÕt spent much time with the included software, so I donÕt know what to say about it other than it seems ok.  IÕm quite happy with the camera.  It comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve isnÕt too too steep. Yes, I recommend it over the competition.","best camera ever...from the image quality, color, function, I can say almost everything. This camera has a cool stitch pictures feature, to find out more just log on to canon's website. I had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this. For those of you who already bought this camera, I suggest you buy a Hi-Ti dye-sub Photo Printer.","I did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 Megapixel cameras.  A couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful, as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made, plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models.  Following my research, I decided on the G3.  In a word, \"awesome\" is how I would describe this camera.  I won't go into the details here, as the online sites (stevesdigicams, dpreviews) go into great depth in their reviews, but I am very pleased with the features, the speed, the picture quality, the flexibility, the automation, and the functional conveniences this camera offers.  With the automatic settings, I really haven't taken a bad picture yet.  And with the panoramic \"stitch\" mode, it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image.  I am absolutely in awe of this camera, Canon put enormous quality into the G3.  Don't walk, run and buy this camera if you have the budget, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.","I don't write many reviews but I'm compelled to do so with this camera.  First and foremost, it will take better pic's than most film camera's. Save them on computer and print out just the ones who want. Duplicates are a no brainer and cheap.  No more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic's for just a couple of keepers.  Crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time.  The technology is finally here folks, to make your photo life easier...a great new use for that underutilized computer.<br />A digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use.  Poor quality pics, short battery life, slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film.  This camera has none of these flaws and will be something you'll use all the time.<br />My wife shuns all new technology and compained when I brought this home, but now she's forever asking for the digital camera.  And I let my kids shoot as many pics as they want, let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones (which are not many). Get the Canon 850 printer and an EX flash.<br />In short, I have a new SLR with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots.  I haven't used any of them since I got the G3. Unless your a professional, now you will need only one camera...this one.","I spent a lot of time comparing different cameras, and I realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera. You can always spend more money to get a better one.<br />However, for a $600-$800 budget, I think this camera is an excellent choice. It has a beautiful design, lots of features, very easy to use, very configurable and customizable, and the battery duration is amazing!!! Also, the display is \"hinged\" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions, or to protect it against any damage. Excellent idea!<br />One bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card, and for most purposes, it is not enough. However, it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras.<br />Another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others I've seen.","I have owned this camera for a short time and wouldn't give it up for anything. It surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera.<br />...","Bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations.<br />In general it is easy to use and well laid out. For ``cool factor'' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and doesn't have any wow factor. It makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly.<br />The G3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro/pro SLR with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography. In the hands of someone who doesn't, it will yield good results on idiot program/auto mode. My wife, who has never used a camera before, picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you don't like what you have created you just delete and try again. The photos she took are better than the results I got from my Nikon SLR and range of lenses! This is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the G3's large mobile screen helps with this.<br />Negative points:<br />The included memory card is too small. Go out and get a 256meg card, it's worth the expense.<br />It is made of plastic. For those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped, picking up a camera like the G3 is an unnerving experience. This is by no means unique to this model, I'm sure. The zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot.<br />This is not a handbag camera. While light, it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets.<br />The function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile.<br />Flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras, you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost. The G3 has a shoe which will take other powerful (and expensive) Canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography.<br />The strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to. If you can afford this camera, you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble.<br />Good points:<br />The functionality on this camera is mind-blowing. Canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out. Learning how to use it will not take very long.<br />The image quality is excellent. Messing around with images in Photoshop (a supplied software package) and printing them on a good printer, yielded excellent results. Unless you are making posters, a G3 is more than good enough.<br />Range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone: point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography.<br />Please note that this is the first digital camera I have owned or used. A lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film. I did extensive research before chosing the G3 but there's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first...","This is by far the finest camera in its price and category I have ever used.  It is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box.  The macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot.","This camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 Megapixel. Beats that Sony F717; its archrival. I'm glad Canon decided to keep the 4Mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology; I can't fit all that resolution(4Mp=2272x 1704 resol.) in my 19in flat monitor(1200x1024 resol.) anyways. Please go to read dpreview.com and you'll get the complete story. My story is based on personal usage.<br />Yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion(I don't like it too but no harm done since I always use the camea LCD screen to see exactly what I'm going to get) in the viewfinder when you don't zoom(when you zoom the lens distortion goes away), Canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon; that is what you see in the viewfinder perimeter is not almost exactly what you will get when you shoot the picture. Moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon. The distortion is not a flaw. As with taking digital pictures, I notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost- this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand.I've haven't heard about a diagnos or fix for this. In terms of the shots taken, this camera is INSANELY GREAT!. The pictures are fabulous and their is a (short)learning curve to it; there are tons of features I haven't even gotten to.<br />In terms of the important accessories,I got myself an the extra litium battery. Based on my used, 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots.  I also got myself a 512MB Viking compact flash(enough for 255 shots at full 4Mp resolution and max picture quality) and a used $250 3lb subnotebook with USB connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so I can verify what I've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash. The compact flash is delicate and I hate to swap it in fear on the connetions(camera and CF) bending(can lead to CF erros) or losing it.<br />Anyways, Canon has improved upon the G2 with this G3. It's a winner. I've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow, car, boat and wind. My only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens(the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes) and I'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and UV lens filter )at lensmateonline.com. They got the best lens adapter for the G3-better than Canon's. That's what I did and hopes this helps.","The camera's a work of art/science -- that's understood. It takes great pictures, operates quickly, and feels solid.<br />To address two previous somewhat negative reviews:<br />(1) Yes, the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder; however, the LCD viewfinder is rather stunning and I find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder.<br />(2) There are, actually, several differences between the G2 and G3, such as differences in Continuous Shooting, the Optical Lens, the Control Layout, Playback Zoom, Image Processing, and so on. ...","I bought my Canon G3 about a month ago and I have to say I am very satisfied. I have taken hundreds of photos with it and I continue to be amazed by their quality. The G3 is loaded with many useful features, and unlike many smaller digital cameras, it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds.<br />Flaws?<br />The lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle, but since I use the LCD most of the time, this is not really much of a bother to me. Still I am a little suprised that Canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera.<br />Despite this minor disappointment, I highly recommend the Canon G3 anyone who is serious about digital photography.","This camera has a major design flaw.  When you look through the view finder (not the LCD) the bottom left corner of the picture (about 15%) is blocked by the lens.  I called the Canon technical service center to see if I had a defective camera.  After about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the LCD and not the view finder, they finally admitted, it was a design flaw in the camera.  Everything else about the camera is great.  If you strictly use the LCD and not the view finder, I highly recommend the camera.  However for me, I occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much.  I'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected.","I've been using a PowerShot S330 for nearly a year, and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom, more adjustability, a hot shoe for an external flash, and a remote control. I looked at both the Nikon Coolpix 5700 and the Canon G3, and decided on the G3 due both to ergonomics (much more comfortable to hold and use) and the price ...<br />I've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far. And so far, I've been very pleased. There's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the S330, especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures. The larger lens of the G3 gives better picture quality in low light, and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer.<br />The moveable LCD screen is great. You can take pictures with the camera held above your head, way down, or beside you with no problem, allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself. The tiny (postage-stamp sized) remote unit is wonderful: not only does it trigger the shutter, it can also be used to zoom and review pictures. I also purchased a good sturdy tripod: the combination of the new camera, tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor, natural-light portraits I never would have attempted before.<br />The hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit: I chose the Canon Speedlite 420. This has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs: the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos, red-eye, and annoying shadows; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing, almost-natural lighting.<br />I needed three batteries to keep myself going with the S330, but the battery in the G3 is a real powerhouse: I shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery. The G3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller Canon cameras: the battery needs to be charged while in the camera, but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery.<br />I have yet to try using all of the adjustment options: shutter priority, aperature priority, light metering adjustments, etc., but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear. You can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting, or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do.<br />Negatives? I've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the S330, and the G3 seems to do only slightly better. (I'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level.) The on-off button feels somewhat flimsy, and has an awkward, tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera. And the body/construction in general has quite a bit of plastic, a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the S330.<br />I bought a 512 MB card, which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution. I was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly, but there's no difference in working with the files. I have a 120 GB remote drive I use to store my digital images: I can imagine that they'd fill up my iBook's internal memory pretty quickly.<br />At the same time I purchased this camera I also bought Adobe's Photoshop Elments 2.0 software, and can't praise it highly enough. If you're investing in a camera at this level, buy this software! And as I said in my review of the S330, all of these digital cameras are easier to use with Apple computers.<br />The bottom line: if you're serious about your digital photography, or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot, this may be just the camera for you. But make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time: you'll see the difference in your photos immediately.<br />Added 2-24.  I've now had the camera for two months and I'm even more pleased with it.  I wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting.  It helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures, especially in mixed-light settings.  If you don't have a gray card, you can use a plain white piece of paper.  I also discovered the exposure-bracket setting, which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter:  the first at the camera-determined exposure, then one lighter and one darker.  Especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations.  I did buy the telephoto lens (and the required extension).  Very easy to use.  I'll probably also get the wide-angle now, too.  Very comfortable camera, easy to use, and the best digital photos you're going to get at this price.","I've been using the G3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it's advertised. After doing a hands-on comparison between the Nikon Coolpix 5700 and Sony DSC-F717 (both of which lack the quality, feel, or features of the G3), I ultimately chose the G3 because of its outstanding image quality (resolution and coloration are superior). It beats the competition in almost every area including battery life, enthusiast features, external flash capabilities, available storage types, image formats, and more. This is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features. It can be a point-and-shoot camera, but if you do not intend to \"get into\" it's finer features, I'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice. All-in-all, I believe this is arguably the best non-SLR digital camera on the market.","The Canon G3 improves in almost all ways on the G1 and G2 before it, and in fact beats the Nikon Coolpix 5000 in performance (picture quality and battery life) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the Canon is a 4 megapixel camera. Canon's optics are better and I believe their processing algorithms are also better. Simply, the Canon G3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point.<br />The Canon allows you to change lenses, and it accepts the IBM Microdrive (Type II Compact Flash), so you can have up to 1 Gigabyte of storage. For me on the Fine resolution setting (not maximum but very close) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 Gig card. The battery life of this camera is twice that of the Nikon 5000 and is better than anything else I've seen.<br />The only minor nits I have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking, it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap, and it is a bit slow between shots. Even with these shortcomings, I still think it is the best digital camera available under $1200.","Definetely a great camera..Proven Canon built quality and lens. Feels solid in hand. Rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S230 (Digital IXUS v3)","amazon_reviews":["product arrived as described; still have this product and it still takes great pictures even after upgrading to a newer camera","I bought this camera and exact the same model for 3 times.

The rechargeable battery and charger are a perfect companion for this camera. All pictures come out great! It makes taking pictures easy, fun, and compact. I recommend buying a case with too, because it is sooo small! pocket size!","I got this camera after looking around and comparing it with others.  I'm glad I decided to go with the S230 for many reasons.<br />Pro's<br />Small and can fit in your pocket, great quality pictures, excellent movie mode with sound, comes with battery and charger, not complicated to use, all around excellent camera, and again the 3.2MP makes the pictures very pleasing to the eye.<br />Con's<br />Zoom isnt the best buts its alright, it takes good pictures when its dark out but you have to edit with a program such as photoshop to make it brighter.  These cons should no way bother you much and should not deter you to buy this camera.<br />I suggest you buy a viking 256MB memory chip because the one that comes with it will leave you able to only take a few pics.  With the 256MB chip you take long videos and take well over 1200 pictures.  All in all excellent camera and as usual amazons shipped it fast and got the camera in a few days after making the order.  I look forward to buy from amazon and cannon again.","I purchased this powershot s230 from Amazon in Dec 03. Before the ordering I did certain amount of research and had experience with a powershot s200. After 2 months of using, I feel that my decision was definitely right. Because:<br />1. The 3.2 MP is sufficient for most of daily photo need, either regular 4 by 6 in, or enlargment to 8 by 11 in. I persoanly don't see any necessaty of having a too high MP camera.<br />2. Extremely compact and strong. This camera has a size smaller than a cigarette pack; and realy stainless steel case. It can be easily put in your pocket and bring anythere, and don't worry about the possible scratches and pressure.<br />3. Long standing rechargable battery which can at least take 100 flash shots. this is a great advantage over those using AA batteries.<br />4. Movie with sound, resolution up to 640X480! you check this, Even the s400, s40, s50 don't have such a high movie quality. Plus instant play back on TV, compete with a camcorder.<br />5. It is peace in mind shopping at Amazon. I enjoyed timely, free shipping, confirmations of every step from order to shipping.<br />6. the only short coming of the s230 is the software.It seems too complicated.","I got one of these little beauties for Christmas last year.  My son did the research, and really picked a winner.  My husband borrowed it several times, and I decided to get him one this Christmas.  He was really pleased, and said when he opened it \"It's the same as yours; I won't have to be re-trained!\"<br />I'm never without a camera---this one is so compact I can carry it in my purse, so if I want to capture a design idea for my house or one of my hobbies, or if there's a beautiful sunset, or whatever.  When showing it to people, I call it my \"computer in a cigarette case\".<br />This is the 3rd Canon camera I've had since the 70's (and the other two are stil going strong).  I've always been pleased with their quality and reliability.  Like the others, this model is as easy or as complex as you want to make it.  I carry the book with me at all times, because this has so many features that I can't keep them all in my head!  I've taken great snapshots with it on the fly, as well as some pretty nice \"arty\" pictures.<br />I love the digital because I can review each picture before I decide whether or not I've captured the EXACT shot I want.  Much better than taking 5 pictures, hoping I got the one I want, and waiting for the film to come back.  Also much more cost-effective.  For anyone debating about whether to go digital, I'd recommend this camera.  I think the first one has about paid for itself by now in saved developing and film costs.  If I want pro prints, I just send them to one of my favorite studios.","Note: I have the older, 2.0 MP model of this camera, the S200.  However, I understand that most of the features are similar on the S230.<br />I bought this camera at an end-of-year sale in 2002.  I have found it to be an excellent entry level model for me with many features I have yet to take advantage of.  The interface is so intuitive, I have figured out most of the camera's features without the user manual.  I find the battery life very good, even with prolonged use of the LCD screen for picture taking and displaying.  The charging time with the included charger is very fast - about a couple of hours.  The camera does suffer in not having a battery life meter, but gives adequate warning when it's about to expire.<br />Like some other users, I find some of the pictures grainy and even blurry.  Primarily those taken indoors, close to the subject and with the flash.  The 3.2 MP model will surely make the pictures less grainy, and playing with the features may help.  The best pictures, however, are taken outdoors.  And these pictures are wonderful with very crisp, true colours!  The optical zoom (2x) is disappointing.  3x or more is preferrable, even for basic photography.","I purchased my S230 for those times I do not want to carry a heavy camera. I have a Nikon D100 that takes superb pictures. I think the D100's images look better than 35mm film images taken with the same lenses. The D100 and any interchangeable lens digital SLR are far too heavy and bulky to carry when your principal activity is anything other than photography. The snaphots I've taken with the S230 have been sharp and contrasty. There is a surprisingly useful video mode that takes 30 second mpegs (with sound). The included 16 Mb CF card is ridiculous but 250 Mb cards aren't that expensive anymore. The camera even writes to the 1GB CF card from my D100. For the novice digital photographer the camera may seem to have a confusing number of options and settings but there are full auto point and shoot modes that do all the thinking for you. For the experienced digital photographer the S230 is a good choice for the camera to carry when you're not carrying a camera.","I bought S230 based on many other people's reviews. I am glad that I made the purchase based on the majority of good reviews. I agreed that the camera takes quality pics.  I'd like to give suggestions to one buyer regarding the pics taken by the camera were grainy. Based on my experience, if the ISO speed is set to 50 instead of 400, the grainy effect will disappear. And the picture is very clear. Also I do find the digital zoom is useful when a landscape pic is taken. I took 2 minutes movie. It's so easy to download and view the movie on the computer. (with sound)  Overall, I love the camera. It's the best buy!","...as it's small and well-built. It works great, though more manual features, like shutter and aperture priority would be nice, like the A70/80 models. It has a superb VGA movie feature that substitutes well for a DV camera when you don't want to lug the DV and its paraphernalia around.<br />A couple notes: digital cams do NOT have \"grain\", that's what film has. Digital cams have noise, which can be seen in blue and black skies, due to pixel heat. As for those circles in flash pictures, I noticed that the reviewer is from the desert, well, ALL digicams will have ghostly circles in flash pics, due to dust. This is NOT relevant to just the S230, but ALL digicams.","This camera is far from perfect, but I don't blame the manufacturer for most downfalls of this camera. Also, look into reviews and actual pictures when comparing digital cameras. Some people will just compare features, which isn't going to cut it. CCD sensor and lense quality will often outweigh the importance of how many megapixels the camera has.<br />Problems with this camera:<br />Artifacts, or circles from low-light flash pictures. These are by far the most annoying problem with the camera, and I can spot them out in quite a few shots. But keep in mind, that many small digital cameras with a flash close the lense suffer from this problem. If you really have to have a small, compact camera, then this may not be such an issue.<br />Red-eye. Another problem with small cameras that have a flash close to the lense. This camera offers a red-eye reduction, which helps quite a bit, but these features often cause subjects to close their eyes or move from the initial flash. Once again, this is common for small cameras, so I'm not going to hold it against Cannon for this problem.<br />Proprietary battery: Its expensive, in case you wanted to buy spare batteries.<br />2x zoom: Its hard to get a decent zoom lense in a small camera. When you are dealing with something this size, 3x zoom is asking for a lot. Once again, I forgive Cannon for this.<br />Good CCD sensor. Outdoor shots come out well.<br />Tough body, with a light lense cover. Small enough to fit in your pocket. Though some reviewers complain of the tripod mount, I find they placed it fairly well to allow for some tripod users to change the battery while the camera is mounted or when using the AC battery dummy adapter. Incase you were wondering, this is why the tripod mount is offset, and it would have been difficult to place it any further from the battery compartment due to the small size of the camera.<br />Autofocus is ok, but the ability to switch between compound and spot metering/focus will help you take better pictures. The feature is conviniently located and all users should learn how to lock focus and light meter.<br />Filming is pretty decent. The reason you have a 3 minute/30 second max recording time is because the film is stored in the buffer before writing to the CF card. This buffer also allows for quick snapshots without waiting for write times, or continuous action shots.<br />I could go on about every feature but it has been covered. If you can't deal with the artifacts, red-eye, and 2x zoom, then look for a bigger camera. If you have to have a small camera, then this camera will be a fine choice. Remember, the best camera you own is the one you use the most. If you find a Canon G2 for a good price but find it a little bulky and fragile and don't want to bring it with you everywhere, then what good is it?","I own a Canon digital SLR and bought this as a \"portable\" camera.  After reading the reviews, I expected that this camera would take good pics, albeit not in the same league as my 10D.  However, to date, I have found the pics grainy and lacking color detail.  I have switched to manual and set the ISO to 50.  Perhaps that will solve the problem. I suspect camera may be defective because no one else has suggested the pics are grainy. One other problem--the camera does not have a battery meter, so you cannot tell when the battery needs re-charging.  This is a major design flaw.  On a good note--the build quality is excellent.  The camera is responsive, although there is a lag with the pics and the buffer. I may wait for Kyocera to perfect their ultra-compacts, because they have recently developed a chip that will load directly to the SD media, and lag is not an issue.","I wish I can give 4.5 stars but the dropdown won't give me that option. This camera makes great pictures. It is small, lightweight, looks durable. I wish it can do 3x zoom but I didn't want to pay the price of the s400. This makes clear, fun movies too. Fast and reliable uploads too. I used to have a Kodak that gives frustrating mysterious I/O errors from nowhere.<br />I am taking a half star off for not able to add date stamp into the pictures, although the upload will put it in the right directory.  The menus are a bit confusing. I should Read-The-Fine-Manual.<br />Besides the driver, the software that it comes with it is quite useless. I don't need such things.","i bought this camera for my sister who is obsessed with coach purses. she cant thank me enough. if buying for a female, definantly purchase coach carrying case. This camera is so tiny!!! its a great gift for any age over 13","This camera has really impressed me.  It's easy to use and the images are very nice quality.  The battery life is incredible.  I've had my camera for 4 weeks and have taken several hundred pictures and have recharged the battery only once!  My only criticism is that only has a 2X optical zoom, but all these compact cameras have 3x or less for the most part.<br />It's a great gift and fits nicely in your pocket to carry around at all times.  Why spend more for a larger camera that you can't put in your pocket?  If the camera is not with you, you can't use it.  Don't wish you had your 5MP 10X zoom camera with you.  Get this camera, put it in your pocket, carry it around with you, take pictures and enjoy them!","Easy to manage, great size.  You need to buy the case though...<br />Charger makes it so easy.. no cables.<br />Highly recommended.","the quality of the pics are excellent!<br />the only con is the movie that you can take is max 3 min for every clip no matter how big is your CF card......","As a part-time graphic designer, I truly appreciate the picture quality that you get with this camera!  This is my second digital camera and the 3.2 megapixels is great if you want to print up 8X10 pictures and don't have a necessity to print poster size pictures. If you want to print 11X14 and bigger pictures, you may want to consider the Canon Powershot S400.<br />I am very happy with this camera!","This is an awesome camera!<br />When dad got a Canon Powershot S100, I was amazed by it, it seemed so good.<br />Then for my birthday, I pulled off getting an S230. I loved it! It took (and still does take) a very short time to charge.<br />Though it has only 2x optical zoom, you can do a wide variety of shots. Digital zoom seems to work fine for me, it never gives me poor quality images.<br />Video mode is probably the best thing about this camera. Though 3 minutes is the maximum, you can always use your computer to merge the videos together.<br />This is a very good camera, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new camera.","The Canon Powershot S230 is an amazing little camera!  This power-packed little item is great for taking crisp, clear photos.  Don't let the lower price tag fool you, this model is just as powerful as most of the higher-priced competitors and has better results!<br />Why this camera is great:<br />--Canon's digital cameras take the best quality pictures.  Sure, some other cameras flaunt their miniscule size and weight, but this camera beats those all in what matters:  photo quality.  Crisp and clear!<br />--It is small!  Perfect for putting in a pocket without worrying you'll lose it.  Sturdy and stylish exterior, and lots of easy-to-use features (such as movie mode) are on the camera.<br />--It has optical zoom.  Although the zoom may only extend to 2X, it is still useful.  An unless you are taking extreme close ups all the time, it's all you really need.<br />--The price is amazing!  I looked at the competitors, and you cannot find this combination for under $300.  Some of the more expensive models are bulkier, come with smaller memory cards, or don't have optical zoom!  The price is likely low because Canon came out with the SD100 to basically replace this camera, but that has some problems with it and doesn't have better features (except for a special chip that prevents erased photos.  Basically an expensive gimmick!)<br />Overall, if you want a great digital camera that is small, sturdy, easy to use, has an optical zoom, takes crystal clear photos, and is relatively inexpensive...go for the Canon S230!","I have quite a collection of digital cameras due to my fiance's photography. I really like my Elph and I use it quite a bit, though I have a smaller camera made by Casio that I tend to use more often.  I've been able to use this camera quite a lot and rarely had bad pictures.  It works fairly well, though I agree with many other reviewers in that the 2x optical zoom is somewhat disappointing.<br />Like most cameras I've bought, it comes with a teeny card (16MB I think).  I have several 256MB and 512MB cards that I use - you can hardly fit anything on a 16MB card!  I wish the camera companies would start selling their cameras with better cards, but that's getting off the topic.<br />This camera is easy to use and probably best for taking outdoor shots, or shots in good lighting.  It's not meant for taking shots in low light, and the flash isn't the best out there.  The movie mode on this camera is GREAT, and easy to transfer from the card to your computer.<br />The batteries last a decent amount of time, and its quick to charge.  Overall, a great camera - especially for beginners who are not quite sure how to use a digital camera!  There are better out there, but it is a solid camera and definitely a good buy.","This is a feather-weight, tiny digicam but the results are nothing short of your typical Canon -- stunning. The colors are vivid and the movies are fun.<br />PROS:<br />(1) In the video, the sound and pic quality are shockingly better than what G5 manages.<br />(2) Body design is good for holding and clicking with one hand.<br />(3) Controls are sensibly positioned and, for the most part, adequately labeled.<br />(4) Software bundle includes Canon's adequate photo utility for downloading and managing images, and ArcSoft Camera Suite 1.2 .<br />CONS:<br />(1) The optical zoom is decent but will leave you wanting more<br />(2) The response time from a click is a bit sluggish<br />(3) I like low-light pics without the flash, but this cam is not as good as the big brother PowerShots.<br />(4) Some of the advance features are a bit hard to navigate, e.g., setting different focal points and certain light adjustments.<br />UPSHOT:<br />Excellent carry-around cam for people who want their cams lightweight, or buying their first modern digicam, or upgrading from an archaic 1-pixel piece. Recommend souping up with some extra memory and battery and you're good to go.","I read a ton of reviews before purchasing this camera and am happy with my purchase. I saw all the negative comments made about this camera and assumed it was made my people who were comparing to other digital cameras and looking for perfection. But even though this is the only digital camera I have used and have no idea how others are, I agree with a lot of what others have said. So beware of these things before you purchase! But even with these flaws I'm happy with it as my first digital camera.<br />- 2x optical zoom is not enough, and who cares about digital zoom when its the same thing as cropping a photo afterwards<br />- flash is weak, camera doesn't take good photos in low light situations, have had spots show up when using the flash; when I don't use flash, photo often comes out blurry<br />- not an action camera, and sometimes feels hard to tell if it has taken a photo when you are trying to take a quick photo<br />- USB port cover looks like it will break off at any moment<br />- you won't know your battery needs recharging until right before it needs to be.. there is no indicator telling you how much battery time you have left<br />- the switch to choose between movie mode, camera mode, and view mode easily slides around and annoying that you have to switch out of camera mode to view photos<br />- movie mode time is limited even if you have a ton of memory<br />This is a good camera to consider if you want one that is easy to use, and you will mostly be taking outdoor and bright light photos. Batteries last a good amount of time and recharging only takes about an hour.","I have owned this camera since March 2003 and have been VERY pleased with both picture and movie quality.  The 640x480 movie mode in my opinion is the best available.  Even Fuji is not as good, as their movies are overly compressed, even though they tout 30fps versus 15fps for the Canon.<br />My main reason for buying this camera was the movie mode and I was not disappointed.  I went on a 2 1/2 week European trip in July and took at least 200-300 movies in the full 640x480 mode.  The limit for each clip is 30 seconds.  I put together a movie for each country by editing together individual clips.  I have movies now as long as 15 minutes.  Oh yeah, I also took pictures <g>.  I took a total of 12 gigabytes for movies and pictures.  They turned out fantastic.  Since I only had one 512meg card, and three 256 meg cards, I brought along a portable hard drive that is specifically built to hold up to 20 gigs of pics and movies from your cameras flash cards.  So every night I would dump the contents from my cards to the hard drive.<br />I took over 3 hours of movie clips and hundreds of pictures.  After 9 months the camera is still going strong.  I am as please with it now as I was on day one.  I also got some very good reviews from those who were on my trip. I sent out a CD with the movies on it to each person.  They loved them and commented that they could not believe the quality.<br />The 2x zoom on this camera was adequate, but of course more is better.  You need to buy a spare battery as you can go through more than one if you are really taking a huge amount of pictures or movies in one day.  Pictures in low light are sometimes difficult to take, however I found the movie mode in low light to be amazing.  Even better than my friends digital camcorder.  Also my wide angle was wider than my friends camcorder.  The video clips can be downloaded to your computer so you can edit them immediately. Much easier than camcorder downloading.<br />A great and free editing software for these movies is at [...]","I don't own this camera, but I sell digital cameras and I have used them all.  I really like the Canon compact digitals in general, but this is one of my least favorites.  I have a problem with cameras that offer little or no optical zoom and try to convince you that digital zoom is anything more than a joke.  I love the S400, with the 4 megapixel sensor and the 3X optical zoom, but I just don't understand the thinking behind a 2X optical zoom like the S230 has.  If you are looking for a small durable digital camera in the same price range check out the Olympus Stylus 300.  You give up sound with your video mode, but most people don't care.  It has a 3X optical zoom and it is weatherproof.  Another one of my favorites is the Samsung V3.  Check your specialty photo retailer, because you won't find this gem at a big box store.  It is a 3.2 megapixel, 3X optical zoom camera with a three year warranty and a Schneider glass lens.  They are being discontinued finally, and the price is down to $269 with a $50 mail-in rebate to boot.  I promise you won't find a better value for a point and shoot digital camera anywhere.  The V4 is still around, though, and it is exactly the same with a 4 megapixel sensor.  It is about $379 and currently offers the same $50 rebate.  I could go on and on, but the point is don't buy the Canon without really checking out your other options first.","In addition to all the other aspects which other reviews have extolled, this camera takes awesome action shots.  I took a picture of an industrial strength fan on high with this camera and you couldn't even tell the fan was on by looking at the picture.  I should note that the autofocus takes about half a second before the picture shoots though.<br />Overall picture quality is excellent, but that has been mentioned a million times in other reviews.","I searched and checked out all the offerings, and settled on this one.  I wanted a good 3.2 camera I would be able to keep easily in my pocket, at a reasonable price.  I considered the A70, but too big.<br />It came down to this one and the same one with SD storage...It was twenty dollars more...So I went with the Compact Flash memory, and saved the twenty dollars. This camera is fine for what I want...The 2x zoom is plenty for framing purposes, and the 3x is not worth the extra money for me...The 3.2 MP is also PLENTY, despite the pixel wars raging...what do you need to do, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue??? No, I didn't think so.<br />I got the 128 card for the extra bucks, got a good deal with rebate on Amazon....about half of other vendors..<br />I do not yet have a reader, since with XP, I don't need to load the Canon software, which a friend hated....With XP, the computer finds the camera and it is simple to upload....It does not appear as a hard drive, however, so I still may pick up a reader for under the price of a movie for two.  The camera works great, and if you really want to find out how well, check out some of the websites devoted to testing cameras..the canons do fine.<br /> If you would rather get another, do so....I think most every digital is worth the selling price....as a matter of fact, my kid wanted one, so I picked up a Kodax CX series for the price of five movies for two. 3.2MP too!!! No zoom, but who cares?<br />SO bottom line, I am using the elph to document my workdays, since I am a television photojournalist and go to about 4 or 5 news stories a day...I am grabbing a quick shot of each one just to have them...since I sometimes get to interesting locations...I just needed a camera to have in my pocket while I am lugging the tv camera around...SO far I am very happy with it. I waited for the price to drop below three hundred, and sure enough it did!","I recieved one of these for my birthday in april and I was blown away by the features, quality, ease of use! EVERYTHING! this is by far the absolute BEST DIGITAL CAMERA EVER!!!  Its small, prefect size, 3.2 mp create gorgeous prints on screen and on paper!!! the movie mode is amazing! you can take full color movies WITH SOUND!!! and upload them right to your computer. it is truly amazing. i was so impressed with this camera that I am buying one for my brother and sister in law this christmas, and I have convinced my boyfriend to buy one for his parents too!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CAMERA!!!!","I am extremely happy with this purchase. This camera exceeded all my expectations!","Just received it in the mail from Amazon.  After playing with it over the past few days I must say that I made the right decision.  It is easy to use.  The quality of the pictures is outstanding.  The design is easy work with - it just feels like a good solid camera.  Other things that stood out to me from other cameras is that it uses a re-chargable battery and the directions from Canon are so easy to follow the camera is idiot-proof.  Canon suppplies you with not only the in-depth directions but quick setup directions and an easy to follow system layout.  Now I see why this camera was #1 on Amazon's list of Digital Camera Best Sellers the day that I ordered it.","I just received my new Canon S230 digital camera. It is my first digital camera. I did a lot research on it. I had two choices Canon S400 & S230. I went with S230. It is about $100 cheaper and 3.2MP is high enough for me. S230 is fantastic! small in size and takes amazing pictures.<br />BTW, I got really good deal on Amazon.<br />Great camera!","I just got my Canon s230 from amazon for a real low price.  Anyway, I must say I am very pleased with this little camera.  Here is Why:<br />1)Small yet durable.  Well constructed metal body<br />2)Made in Japan (well know for high quality in electronics)<br />3)Takes video at 640x320 (with sound), very sharp video you just have to see to believe (highest resolution around, better than even higher end cameras like nikons and s50 and s400)<br />4)Softwares as well as camera menus and controls are easy to understand even for beginners.  Instruction manuals are well written as well.<br />5)High resolution LCD screen so you can see your pictures crystal clear (unlike competitions such as Casio and Minolta which have very low quality LCDs)<br />6)9 point AIAF is great technology that allows for nine focus points, and the flexizone even lets you choose which zone you want to focus out of nine, so you don't have to worry about leaving out a part of a beautiful tree or roof of a house just because you want to focus on your friends and family members when taking picture.<br />7)Professional and Efficient customer's service.  If you have a question go to canon website to search for answer.  You can also ask them a question and they get back to you within 24 hours (I was surprised).<br />My Thoughts about Some Complaints Others May Have:<br />1)2x optical zoom: this is a mini point and shoot camera and most of the time you can just stand closer to your subject if you need a closeup.  I mean, I also have a canon s30 which is 3x, but I personally could not justify much advantage with a single x higher. (if you want to see a real difference pickup a 5x-8x optical zoom camera and you will understand my point, but be ready to pay an extra 200+ dollars)<br />2)Red Eye: Small camera means close proximity of flash to shutter = red eye.  What do you expect?  Plus this only happens at night, and can easily be corrected with software provided.<br />3)Technology: which other camera gives you 9 point focus? (not to mention Flexizone). which other brand give you 640x320 video? How often do you actually want video clip longer than 30 seconds? (if you need longer, if would be great idea to buy a camcorder, cause 512mb flash is only going to give you 8min at max)<br />4)Proprietary Battery: I challenge anyone out there to fit 2AA battery in this thing.  There is no way.<br />One misconception I see alot in reviews is that people don't see the overall funtionality and quality of a product base on camera class.  You can't expect this thing to perform like a huge camera, at least not in today's technology.<br />1) Just because a camera has the same 3 megapixel doesn't mean their picture quality are the same ...  Some camera over compress the file so it looks a little grainy at full size, which for me is annoying.<br />Finally, I read numerous reviews and saw various cameras before I finally decided on my s30 and now s230 (my second canon baby brother).  I catergorized digital cameras in general based on overall feature and performance with 1 being the finest and 5 being the most basic as follows: (Note Canon and Nikon are tie at first place)<br />1) Canon (sharpest,most color accurate pictures)<br />1) Nikon (sharp, outstanding macro capability)<br />3) Sony (great laser and lens, picture quality can be better)<br />4) Olympus (AA battery and good picture, high optical too)<br />5) Minolta,Casio,Fuji,Kodak (these you have to enlarge their sample photos to see what I am talking about, and understand why they are in the last place)<br />Don't just take my word.  I encourage you to read more professional reviews.  Just thought my research can help give you some insight.<br />Wish you all get to own a great camera for keeping precious memories of life!","This itineration of the now venerable ELPH series was meant to be a half step up from the once very popular S200 model. The change here was to increase resolution from 2 megapixels to 3.2 megapixels. Otherwise, its features were much the same: a slick looking steel body, a proprietary battery & charger, a too-tiny memory card and a 2X optical zoom and a (not very useful) 3X digital zoom. All of the Canon models (I've owned 4) have been durable and all of them take good pictures.<br />By now the 230 has been surpassed in most areas by cameras costing more or less the same amount of money. Higher resolutions, longer optical zooms, faster image handling (meaning less time btwn shots) and better battery conservation are now commonplace. Perhaps more devastating to the elan of these Canons is the plain fact that their diminutive size appeal has been lost to cameras featuring all of the above advancements in packages that make the 230 seem like a leviathan (the Pentax Optio & Minolta DiMage being two good examples).<br />If you already have an S230 or someone gives you one, you have nothing to complain about. It's a reliable and capable camera. However, if you're about to invest in digital technology, try one of the more advanced cameras mentioned above.","this was a really good camera.  took really good pics.  the only think i didn't like was the shutter speed.  took really long for it to take the actual pic. otherwise everything else was good.","The S230 is fantastic. The quality of the images shows that Canon put a lot of quality into this little camera. There are many wannabes now, but Canon created this product line. More than pixels are the electronics and quality of the lens. Forget any 'digital zoom' features as useless. The only thing I wish for is the ability to save files in other than JPG format -- RAW would be very handy.","I bought this in Summer 2003 and it is a great camera.  The tiny, and I mean tiny, size of it makes it great because you can put it in your pocket - no need for a case or straps, etc.  It is great to take to a bar, ballgame, or whenever you do not feel like carrying around a carrying case or something bulky.  The quality of the picture is great, has 3 megapixels which is more than enough when you develop them onto 4\" x 6\" pictures.  I had some 8x10 photos developed and the quality is still perfect.  I highly recommend this camera!","I received this from my Husband for my Birthday last week and I had always loved the camera since my husband got his this past summer.  Now I have one of my own plus got this great Coach case and neck strap.  Now I see its actually less than what my husband paid for his S230 withiout the case this summer.<br />This should be a great seller for any woman for Xmas!","I have owned this camera for about six months now. I have taken over 2000 pictures with it, and very few have turned out bad. The detail this camera picks up is amazing! I am able to zoom in on objects in the photo and still have good detail.  The 2x optical zoom is very disappointing and has been a limiting factor for some very nice shots while hiking. I have yet to use the included 16MB CF card. I ordered a 512MB CF card the same day I ordered my s230.  At maximum resolution, and maximum quality, it takes over 300 shots! At maximum resolution, and standard quality, it will take 550 shots! (~15 rolls of 36 exposure film!) I have yet to find this to be a problem. A 256MB CF card is really all you need for this camera. A second battery would also be a good idea. You can expect about 100 shots from the battery with the flash and LCD on, along with constantly going to the ?picture viewer? mode to show everyone the pictures.<br />The one major drawback that I have not seen mentioned is the mode selector switch. Its on the top-back edge. About 25% of the time when I pull the camera out of my pocket, the switch catches just enough to move from picture mode, to video mode. Then I take a nice video instead of a picture. This issue has been addressed with the s400.<br />I have also seen some complaints about the offset tripod mount and the picture button being on the other end so it shakes when you take pictures on the tripod. You can set the camera timer for two seconds of ten seconds. Set it up for two. Then you push the button, step back, and it takes a perfectly clear shot!<br />I have used many Canon digital cameras; they are a very good choice! Very solid, (I take mine mountain biking every weekend) and it takes great pictures.<br />The 100-240 volt charger works nicely too! Took it to china for a week, and had no trouble at all.","I had bought several other digi cams b4 this one and hated them all. This one is very easy to use, pics come out clear, and easy to carry around because of its small size. I guess the only downside ive discovered so far, is because of its small size, the buttons are hard to use sometimes, especially for someone with larger hands, ie  a man, for example. Other then that, I would recommend to anyone for a first cam, to get your feet wet in the digital camera market. Well worth the price.","It's my second Canon Elph, I had the 100 and it was a great camera. I purchased the 400 for the higher resolution, but the video resolution is not as good. For the money the Elph 230 is the nicest camera on the market.","it's amazing how fast new products are brought to market, especially in digital photography.  the s230 was the first 3MP in canon stable of ultra-compact cameras.  since then, they have brought out a 4MP s400, a slightly smaller sd100, and an even smaller sd10 (no zoom though). the s230 continues to be a strong performer and pricing has dropped to match the competition.  this camera remains a strong value.<br />pros:<br />- very good photo quality.<br />- uses the same DIGIC image processor found in more expensive canon cameras.<br />- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail.<br />- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours.<br />- all metal body, solid construction.<br />- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc).<br />- the LCD monitor (1.5\") is bright and has an anti-reflective coating - gives good live preview and review even in well lit situations.<br />- shooting priority play mode (a half-press of the shutter release always returns to shooting).<br />- fast shot-to-shot times.<br />- fairly good startup time, especially for an extending lens camera.<br />- minimal shutter lag.<br />- AF assist lamp works well.<br />- USB connectivity.<br />- good battery life, although i would recommend carrying a spare since canon's batteries are proprietary.<br />- as with most canon cameras, documentation and included software are very good.<br />- ultracompact: 3.4 x 2.2 x 1.1 in, weighing only 6.4oz.<br />cons:<br />- limited 2x optical zoom.<br />- redeye performance could be improved.<br />- average macro performance.<br />- average flash performance.<br />- you'll need to remove from tripod to open the battery compartment.<br />- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom.<br />- very few manual controls - this is okay if all you want is a point and shoot.<br />- RAW and TIFF formats not supported.<br />- the supplied 16MB CF card is inadequate - be prepared to shell out a few more bucks for at least a 256MB card.<br />- proprietary battery - again, a few more bucks for a spare.<br />as already mentioned, the s230 continues to be a good value but there are newer entries in the ultra-compact segment of the market.  if you want 4MP resolution and 3x optical zoom, consider the canon s400 - the eighty dollar premium is well worth it, in my opinion.  more comparable cameras at about the same price point would be the canon s100, pentax optio s, and the casio ex-z3.<br />i hope this helps you with your buying decision.  peace.","This is one awesome camera for basic needs.  The size of the camera is just slightly bigger than a credit card.  2X optical zoom works fantastic.  Came with an NB-1LH battery (the longer lasting one than the NB-1L.  You can aim at things before you take a picture and see what is being focused by the camera.  Picture quality is pretty good during day light, or indoors.  But not really great for outdoors at night/dusk.  It works for me!","This camera has been perfect for me!  I've had it for 4 months now (I was away for two months in the summer) and still I've taken over 1,000 pictures.  The quality is great, the features on the camera are amazing too!  I never expected it to be half as good as it is.  Also, the size of this thing is really small!  It's not that thin, but it's so compact!  I love it so much, anyone who is considering a 3 megapixel camera should get THIS one!","If you are an insurance claims appraiser or adjuster, this camera will make your life simple.  You just can't take a bad picture.  It gets all the details. Crisp and clear.","Pros:<br />Nice Size<br />Style<br />Great image quality<br />LCD works great in light or dark<br />Energy Efficient compared to other cameras<br />Only two hours or so to charge the battery pack<br />It may be small, but this camera has lots of options<br />Cons:<br />16MB compact flash that is included is okay, but could be better<br />2X zoom relegates this amazing camera to mostly a point and shoot","It's a little sparse on fancy features, but it's got great stuff all around. Good resolution, decent zoom, some customizability with different color settings (B&W, sepia, etc.). The menu is very intuitive and easy to use. CompactFlash memory is cheap now, so it's easy to have TONS of space for pictures. The shutter lag is fairly short, so you don't have to worry too much about action shots.<br />The weakest part is it's low-light shooting, but it just takes some fiddling around with the white balance. Generally, once you find the right settings on exposure and so one, the flash is fine for most general purposes. It handles close-ups well (even macro-type shots), and is a great size. The battery life is a bit on the short side, so get an extra battery to carry around with you if you're going to be out all day.<br />I use this camera alongside my Canon SLR, so it's a nice mix - the SLR for the stuff I'd like to set up more for, say when I go hiking or weddings, or something like that, but I also carry around the S230 for that stuff as well, and it's just nice to have around when going out with friends or a date with my girlfriend.","This is a fantastic camera.  I bought it for my wife as a general point and shoot and after playing with it found it to be far more capable.  Excellent feedback, easy menus, lots of little \"neato\" features such as black and white, sepia toning, oversaturdation, signal histograms, 50-400 ISO range, video recording, etc.  Enough features to make it a worthy tool for even more serious photography.<br />It's shortfalls are few.  It lacks a manual focus capability, the zoom range is limited, video record times are somewhat limited, and though its small size is abundantly convenient, it makes holding the camera steady for slow shutter and telephoto shots difficult.<br />Nevertheless, it is a lot of camera for the price.  Go to Amazon and spend the $... to buy a 128MB or 256MB Compact Flash card.  The extra storage will be appreciated.  Enjoy!","I bought this camera to replace the S200. It's the same camera, upgraded with more megapixels and better software. Physically, they're the same<br />WARNING: My camera survived being basshed about a lot, and being dropped from five feet onto rocks (twice). What it can NOT deal with is dust and sand.<br />Once anything goes into the little crevice around the zoom lens, or enters the camera through the gaps in the battery  or flash card holders, it doesn't come out, and the camera eventually malfunctions.","This little camera is very easy to use yet has all of the features that an experienced, amature (sp?) photographer can hope for.  And the software package rocks!  This was the best 3 figure purchase I have ever made!","I shopped for digital cameras for months, read the reviews, asked the experts at various stores and finally bought the S230. The best features of this camera are: It will fit in your shirt pocket, it is made of all metal (no plastic), the movie mode goes for about 2 minutes (which is the longest I've ever seen), it uses a rechargable lithium Ion battery (no AA's here), it is very easy to zoom in/out with the same finger you will snap the picture, the digital zoom is incredible, and the photos are absolutely fabulous. I take some of my digital photos and have prints made. They look like they came from a film camera. I find myself taking a lot of photos, as it is so easy to just put it in your shirt pocket just in case you need it. This is my second Digital Elph....I highly recommend it.","I've only had this camera for about a week, but it's amazed me in many ways! The shape and size can't be beat (very indiscreet in your pocket) and the photo quality is better than i expected. The 2x optical zoom is adequate, but there could have been more. The digital zoom, however, makes up for that by zooming in a lot before losing too much quality. The battery life is great for shooting lots of pictures, and the interface is intuitive and not hard to figure out. The software however, does little more than flip the picture and save it to your computer. I would definetely recommend a larger CF card and a case (i have the PSC-50) plus an inexpensive image editor for touchups. Overall, Canon did a great job on this tiny camera.","This camera is definitely one of the best point-and-shoot cameras around.  I know 'cuz I've tried 5 other cameras before deciding to keep this one for good.  I've tried the Kodak DX4900, DX6340, Minolta S414, Canon PowerShot S45, and the Sony DSCP8.  This camera beats all the others I've tried either in size, weight, ease of use, and/or autofocus ability.  Most reviews I read here tells you what's good about this camera.  I think it's important to list all the negative things about this camera, so you can make a better informed decision.  Here goes...<br />1. Short battery life.  At full charge, the bundled 840mAH battery last for around 30 pictures (with LCD screen on).  Buy a 1000mAh battery ... it last much longer.<br />2. Autofocus works 90% of the time.  The other 10% of the time, you'll get fuzzy pictures, regardless whether it is inside or outside.  I find this acceptable since the other cameras I've tried only produced well focused pictures 80% or less of the time. (The DX4900 produced well focused pictures 99% of the time)<br />3. Red eye.  I get many more red eye pictures with this camera than I do with others.  This perhaps has something to do with the fact that the flash is very close to the lens.  This is acceptable to me 'cuz I have software that can solve this easily.<br />4. 512MB card only gives 308 pictures at 3.2MP and the best quality mode.  I was able to get 209 pictures with a 256MB CF card in the DX4900 when set at 4MP and best quality.  The math just doesn't add up...I thought I would get at least 400 pictures with the S230.<br />5. Battery door easiy pops open.  It lacks a battery door lock so you can open the door easily.  There is however a lock to keep the battery from falling out.<br />6. Zoom is insufficient.  2x zooming is certainly not enough for times zooming is needed.  Two cameras I own in the past had 4x zooming and I certainly love to have that in this camera.<br />7. Very very close-ups cannot focus at all.  I tried taking a picuture of the serial number on my pen and it simply would not focus.  I tried that with my DX4900 and it was able to focus on the serial number.<br />8. Casing scratches easily.  I found a number of visible scratches two days after using it.  I tried very hard to handle this well and even bought a case to hold it.  But it still is vulnerable to scratching.<br />9. Controls and menu options are fairly complicated to use.  You really have to read the manual to use this well.<br />All in all, this camera is an excellent camera.  I love most of the features on this camera and finds it as a keeper.  The other cameras I've tried cannot match up to this camera.  You simply can't go wrong buying this camera.  I bought mine ...brand new just last week, so shop around for bargains.","I recently took this camera on a trip to Nepal and it performed flawlessly. Lasted through 250 photos on two batteries (I charged them both before I left) with battery time left over at the end. Just make sure you turn the LCD off, it draws power really fast. I used a 256 MB SanDisk CF card, worked perfectly. Takes great photos close up & far away, indoor & outdoor, good balance of resolution & price (much cheaper now that the S400 is out!). I dropped it on rocks a few times with only tiny scratches on the metal case to show for it.","I bought the camera after reading the reviews and believe this is what I need with such a low price.When I first saw this small camera I really felt it is cute.<br />Then I began to take pictures. But all the pictures in-door and out-door come to be soft. Just not sharp or clear enough. I was really disappointed.Only the ones I took very clost the object seem to have satifying quality.<br />The flash is very weak, too.<br />Disappointedly I had to return the camera. Not sure if this is Canon's problem or the camera is just defective.<br />BTW, I saw my friend's Canon S30, which seems to work much better than this one.","From word of mouth heard this was a great camera, picked one up and love it.  For the price, you get a real sturdy camera that has every feature you need.  If you just use to for point & shoot, no need for higher resolution.  Wish it included a case though!","I use to own a Canon S200 and an old HP digicam.<br />The Canon S200 lacks in pixels and the S400 is just overkill and overpriced.  Canon S230 sits right in between and everything is right.<br />POSITIVE<br />- it's small, carry it in your pocket<br />- durable, I had no case, hit it around a couple of times, still no problem<br />- takes up to around 2 minutes of film.<br />- the price is awesome ...<br />- rechargable battery and charger - lasts a long time.<br />NEGATIVE<br />- if anything, I wish the video quality was a bit better.","Just bought it and I love it.  The size of the camera is fantastic, and more then makes up for the smaller optical zoom (2x).  If your considering this camera I would highly recommend it but it does tend to have a lot of red eye in the pictures (easily removed w/software).","While I have owned several digital cameras,the Canon Digital Elph series has always amazed me.  I owned the early 100 modle and gave it to my Father who has used it aroung the world.  My S230 was used for over 5000 pictures before I retired it for the new S400.  Honestly the 8x10 pictures I get from the new S400 are no better than the S230.  The longer zoom is nicer, but the s230 still as other owners have said an oustanding camera that is small enough that you will acytually take it with you on the ski slpes or other action sports where a big slr type is just too big.","Received my Canon S230 last week in the mail. For two years I have been experimenting with a 1.0 MB digital camera to justify my need for switching to a higher pixel camera. Two years ago there were not too many choices and average of $500 for a good 2.0 MP based camera was beyond the budget for most point-and-shoot enthusiasts. After reading many reviews and experimentation I decided to go with the Canon S230 for the following reason; best value for this price point ... for a 3.2 mp digital camera with the added bonus of form, feature and design.<br />After playing with the camera for a week, I am happy with my selection. Its packed with features and the included software package is more than enough for basic adjustments. Menu is easy to understand and finding/setting regular feature is only a few clicks away. The included 16 MB memory card is only good enough for a short day trip. It works well in low-lit areas and daylights pictures are vibrant with natural colors. Canon has kept up with its reputation with high quality products. Their new line of photo printers will please users who want immediate results. A bit of advice for new users, evaluate all your needs carefully. Don't go for the mega pixel only. Size, feature, build quality and price plays equally important role in choosing the right camera for your need. First time buyers will be very happy if they choose to go with Canon S230.","I have always been a cannon fan and this camera is very easy to use.<br />It can be connected to you computer and is easy to use to print pictures to your printer.<br />I like not having to buy film and always able to swap in a fresh memory card which I can then resue once I have downloaded my pictures to my computer.<br />This is a good camera worth the price.<br />Best Regards to all, MC - TheStickRules.Com","I just purchased this camera about a month and a half ago and I love it. I got a new boyfriend so just like my new toy I take so many pictures of him and they all come out great. Also I take pictures of my family and myself. I originally purchased the camera because I'm a graphic design student and we use alot of pictures and photography in our work. I don't want to deal with licensing issues with stock photography and I can avoid all that by taking my own pictures. This camera is great, I thought I would want a camera of more than 4 megapixels but the 3.2 megapixels are very crisp. I have not yet printed any pictures from this camera because but I'm sure I will once I return back to school. So I can't really comment on how the pictures look when printed.<br />I only rated it 4 stars because I think the Optical Zoom [works too slowly]. It's only 2x and that's not too good when you are trying to take some pictures of something far away. Also it takes a long time for when you press the shutter until it actually takes the picture. My boyfriend, his family and I went to this spectacular fireworks show this past 4th of July holiday and the camera took to long to take the pictures of the fireworks. I mostly just have pictures of the black night sky. The only way I could get any thing of the fireworks was to just record it with the movie mode. I also wish I had a bigger card so I could have gotten more than just the Fireworks Finale.<br />Other than that this is a great camera and really easy to use. My three year old nephew can use this camera. He runs around taking pictures of everything using the crisp LCD screen as a viewfinder.","I have not had any problems with this camera. The only annoying thing is that the Flash is way to bright so if you are taking pictures at home it really washes stuff out. But then again if you turn the flash off it is then too dark...ah will. If you have the right light though everything is fine. I am planning on trying like paper or something over the flash to mute it. It might work. But good camera. I will be using this for years to come. I recomend the 256MB Viking Flash card. You get more memory. It is REALLY work it. You can get almost 2000 photograghs!!","I owned an S110 before it was swiped from my desk drawer. The little puppy could do quite a lot.I thought that it had all that I needed.<br />I recently bought the S230- it's quite the camera, and now it has more features than I know how to use correctly, like manual ISO settings, manual shutter speed, etc. Considering the size of the camera, the image quality is excellent. However, considering the size, it's easily lost or stolen.<br />On a side by side comparison with a sony camera, the canon tends toward a red shift, where the sony tends toward the blue. This makes skin tones look great on the canon, whereas the sony takes some great landscapes (the sony pictures of the sunset over San Francisco Bay blew the canon out of the water)<br />I have a 128mb CF card, and always run down the battery before the card fills. I haven't tried turning off the LCD to see if it helps.<br />I held back 5 stars simply because 5 stars should be a flawless product. In my mind, 4 stars is still excellent.","ultra tiny, excellent over all image quality, great for point-and-shooters. also some nice features for semi-advanced users. takes very good videos. i got a second battery and a 512meg card, cost an extra $...,however,you will never need anything extra for day trips. two batteries and that size card will keep almost anyone content for days on end. in my experience the battery will last for about 120 pictures,with the LCD,and a handful of videos.<br />what most don't mention is this camera comes with the built in ability to stitch together multiple images to great a panned image. you can stich as many photos as you wish. maybe a large scene won't fit in the cameras lens but you don't want to zoom out because it will include some unwated feature? zoom in and take 2 pictures rather than one and the computer software will stitch the photos together flawlessly. you can also do 180/360 degree pan of a scene.<br />gripes:<br />the zoom is tiny,but its to be expected for this cameras size.<br />the full res videos are a tease, they are only up to 30 seconds long. if the camera had the ability to record streaming video right to the compact flash i wouldn't even need my camcorder anymore!<br />get a compact flash card reader, the USB cable and software is a bit cumbersome for more advanced computer users.<br />**side note for the gentlemen who dislikes the lag between pressing the shutter button and the actual photo taking.**<br /><br />read the manual,it will explain in detail this process. press the button half way,the camera adjusts all the settings automatically to the suroundings(lighting,focus,flash,shutter speed/aperature,ISO,etc),when its ready,it lets you know. then you may take the photo by fully depressing the button.","I've had this camera since February (it's now June).  I really liked it at first.  When I took it to Cancun, it was great for taking photos of Mayan ruins and such.  But the longer I have it, the more the drawbacks irritate me.<br />The biggest drawback is that in anything less than direct sunlight the CCD SUCKS.  I have a horrible time getting good focus even just in the shade of a tree.  Indoors I get a lot of digital artifacts.  With my previous camera, a Canon Powershot A50, it was wonderful in low-light applications, very clear, very sharp, very good color.<br />There is the flash, but it isn't the best.  I still end up with soft (fuzzy) photos with a flash indoors, and if I'm close to the subject it often ends up being washed out.  I consider myself a fairly advanced amateur photographer and have tried all sorts of automatic and manual settings to improve it indoors to no avail.<br />At this point I am beginning to review other cameras because I need to replace this.  The \"low-light\" drawbacks (that's in quotes because it's not so much a low-light problem as a less than extreme sunlight problem) make the image quality too embarassing to share photos from family functions.  I used to be proud of the photos I took indoors at family functions and now I only share them reluctantly.<br />That said, the small size and the fast startup and shot speeds are great.  And the video function is the one function that works great even indoors.  I definitely like everything except whatever causes it to perform so poorly indoors and in low light.<br />Buyer beware!","I, along with most of my friends, have this camera. You really feel as though you could back over it with the car and it would still work great. The pictures turn out great. The camera is incredibly easy to use and compact.  You will have to purchase an additional memory card (256 Megs recommended) since the one that it comes with will only hold 12 pictures.<br />The negatives:  The LCD display has trouble if you are trying to take pictures without good lighting.  The zoom is limited but this camera is intended more for taking pictures of close up things versus long distance vistas.","Love this camera.  Take it anywhere and shoot as many pics as I want with a 512mb card I got from Dell for $$$.  This is my first digital camera and I can't stop using it.  Very easy to use and takes great photos.  Works great with my new photo printer, the Canon i470d.  I highly recommend it.","I agree with most reviews.  This is indeed an awesome camera, great fun for the money!  The video feature for under $400 is well worth it.  I do not regret getting it.<br />However, my biggest complaint is on the [poor]software shipped with the box.  (Please Note:  I use Windows 2000/SP3, so do many other users).  Here's a list:<br />1)  The USB connection [is weak]!  It's connected, but it doesn't detect so unless you switch some buttons on the camera to \"excite\" it!<br />This is fustrating sometimes.  I mean, without a good connection, what good is a digital camera?  This problem is constant with all three of my machines at home.  However, I admit this is a minor problem, and might be fixed by upgrading my system software.<br />The next problem is by far much worse:<br />2)  The software is of very low quality.<br />Did canon save cost py outsourcing to some poor country to code it?  Why would a device driver need to be 25MB and a simple program need 100MB?  It is buggy as hell and runs very slowly.<br />Figure out how to download the avi video clips yet?  The software doesn't let you do that.  Even the so called \"video editing\" software doesn't let you do that!<br />3)  The resulting photos are really high quality, however I noticed that they tend to be a lot darker when transfered to the computer.  It looked a lot brighter (and nicer) on the LCD screen on the camera.  The samething applies for the video clips.  There's nothing in the manual to fix this problem.. I mean, how come the downloaded images look dramatically different from the one you preview on the LCD screen?<br />This is what I ended up doing to get around these problems:<br />1)  You get used to the USB thing :)  Or spend an extra 30 bucks to get a CF card reader.  It's not that big of a problem... really<br />Use other standard photo-editing software to mess with your images.<br />For video files, I recommend converting to DIVX format using the program \"VirtualDub\" right away (decrease the file size to 10% of the original), and then using other programs to make it into MPEG VCD format if you want (so you can make a VCD to see it on TV)<br />3)  Use \"gamma correction\" in any software to correct the light/darkness problem with any good software (ie, not canon's).  For video files, there's a filter in the VirtualDub program that lets you correct the brightness/contrast of the video clip, so mess around with that.  I got pleasant results afterwards.  However, ordinary users (like granddad) don't need to do these things!!<br />I would definately give this camera 4-5 stars if they made the software more pleasant for me.  But overall, it is a very good camera.  They definately spent a lot of time on the camera itself.  It is shameful that they did not do so to the software...","I've tried/owned a few digital cameras in the past and I've found the S230 to be THE BEST digital camera in its price range.<br />Picture quality is great.  Physical size of the camera is awesome (that can't be beaten by anyone).  Movie mode works like a charm...great picture and sound.  Battery seems to last forever (and charging time is minimal).<br />Since no product is 100% perfect, I'd have to say the only drawback with the camera is its responsiveness to a quick-photo.  Sometimes it takes about a half-second to respond after you push the button.  Other than that \"problem\", though, it's tough for me to think of a second drawback.<br />I hope you buy this camera.  You won't be disappointed.","The deciding factor for me in getting this camera turned out to be its high-quality video capability. As far as I am aware, there is no digital still camera that can compete with the sharp resolution of the movie clips this camera can produce (though Canon's Powershot A70 comes close).<br />Who would guess that a camera this tiny would win the prize in that department? Yet it's true. I was considering going with this camera's 4 megapixel sibling, the s400. Yet ironically and weirdly, that camera, which is supposed to represent an upgrade to this one, has only a lower-quality video capability. [Who at] Canon...made that decision?<br />I don't want to give the impression that this camera's video can compete with that of a real video camera. Be prepared for these limitations:<br />1) In the highest resolution setting (recommended), each clip is limited to a maximum of 30 seconds. It is 3 minutes in the lower settings.<br />2) Settings like focusing, zoom, and exposure do not adjust during a video clip. This means that if your subject starts out in the shade and shifts to a bright setting, it may look overexposed.<br />3) The recorded sound of the video is not great, with some hiss always audible and pronounced wind noise in a breeze.<br />4) You don't get the 30fps of a real video camera, so the motion is not as smooth-looking.<br />5) No digital stabilization. Hold the camera very steady or use a tripod.<br />6) You need lots of memory to record videos, approximately 1MB per second. I purchased two 512 MB flash cards. Each can record over 8 minutes of video clips, or hold over 300 highest-resolution photos. A 512 costs a little over $100 right now.<br />Despite these limitations, the extreme portability of this camera has convinced me to use it for most of my video shooting. The 30-second time limit is not as bad as you might at first think. Even when using my dedicated video camera, I doubt I have taken many shots of greater length. The ones that are longer are boring anyway.<br />And I have found a solution to the terrible wind noise. By putting the smallest bandaid I could find over the tiny dot of a microphone (to serve as a wind screen), the wind noise was completely eliminated without, amazingly, cutting down the audibility of other sounds.<br />Being able to take photographs when appropriate, and videos when appropriate, with the flip of a switch from the same tiny camera that you can take anywhere, is wonderful. You can even combine both into great movies using tools like Microsoft's PhotoStory (PLUS Digital Media edition software) and Windows Moviemaker version 2 (which is a free download for XP users).","Some of the reviews below are not accurate...<br />This is an INCREDIBLE camera! Shure it's compact, but it's also very durrable, so taking it on a vacation is perfect. The image quality is very high. There is a cool panorama and auto-stich feature that let's you automatically combine multiple photos into 1. Also, a great feature is the video mode - it has very high-quality sound and a crisp picture.<br />This camera is much better than other 3 and 4 mp olympuses and minoltas!<br />Wondering whether or not to buy the s200 which is 2.1 MP instead of this camera (s2300 with 3.2 MegaPixels)?<br />I would deffinitely choose this 3.2 mp because at 2 mp many pictures are blury and small, making them hard to edit and print. Buying a 2mp nowadays is like purchasing a computer at 1ghz: not terrible but still bad.<br />Pros:<br />Great picture quality<br />Awesome video mode<br />Red-eye feature is good<br />Macro works perfectly<br />Zoom goes up to 10x digital!<br />VERY easy to use yet also great for manual use<br />Cons:<br />The auto-focus takes a little too long<br />----------<br />The auto-focus is still very powerfull and actually scans the image frame to select the sharpest spot.<br />This is deffinetely worth your money.","Cannon S230 is a good camera , it gives beautiful and sharp pictures, but as compared to Cybershots from SONY, the camera lacks lots of features like<br />The movie is limited to time frame of 3 minutes as compared to Cybershots where movie is limited with the size of memory.<br />The Cybershots have special modes for taking pics at night, snow, beach and other special conditions.<br />The camera has 2x optical zoom, which is pretty low.<br />The camera dos not show battery time as compared to other Cybershots.<br />In all , I would prefer to spend more money on Cybershots rather than paying for Powershots","I bought this little thing several months age. I didn't go anyhere without it.It's so nicely designed that you can carry it to any place.With those advanced features ,you can take very sharp pics. digitally developed photoes are no less vivid than those taken by optical cameraes.I love it","What an incredible camera!  Incredible resolution for printing, compact enough to fit in your front pocket, and even has video for spur of the moment situations.  Manual mode, automatic mode, things just don't get much sweeter.  I would recommend getting batteries and memory on ebay for a great deal.  This is the best camera in its class.","I take my Canon PowerShot S230 every where.  The pictures are fantastic.  I love the video options.  With a 256 MB memory card, I take almost 500 pictures.","I think that this camera is great. I like that it is compact making it very easy to keep with you.  The picture quality is great I have taken far shots and close-ups.  The color from the pictures are so full.  This camera has many features such as manually setting the AWB (auto white balance) or you can have the camera do it in the auto setting.  I like the 3 minute video feature.  Now nothing is perfect so this is what I don't like about the camera.  First is you don't know how much battery life there is for the camera so best bet is to keep an extra battery available.  I recommend getting the 256mb of memory the 16mb that comes with the camera is simply not enough. Also I don't like the switch on the camera that is used to go between still pictures, video, and replay/download.  The switch moves to easily it should have a little more resistance. I like compact and quality prints, and many options this camera was for me.","This is a really great camera. Has a lot of features like autostitch and movie recorder (has a built in microphone). Allows you to change picture settings like b/w, sepia...<br />Very convenient to carry around, fits into a pant pocket easily.","This is my second digital camera. My first, a Nikon Coolpix 995 is so INFERIOR to the Canon S230 that they're not even in the same class. The Canon's operation is much more streamlined and simple than the Nikon, plus, and this is a BIG PLUS, there is virtually NO LAG TIME between pressing the shutter and it releasing. With the Nikon, as with other digitals, there can be a 1-4 second (non-self timer) lag which can spoil many a picture. While the Canon may not have all of the features of the Nikon, it has more than enough settings to fine tune your images. But the trade-off in performance alone makes the Canon superior. If you're looking for a digital camera that performs and functions like a regular film camera you can't go wrong with the Canon S230.","Wow. I got my s230 about five weeks ago, and have taken over 1500 photos already. I am thrilled with the quality of the camera. It is heavy, built with a very sturdy case, the buttons are quality, the menus (software) are incredibly concise and easy to use/understand. Of course, what most people are concerned with is the picture quality--for this type of camera, it is outstanding. Very few of my photos have turned out \"flat\" and looking like cheap digital pics. Most of them are vibrant and full of depth and detail.<br />Here are the only problems I've encountered so far:<br />1) The worst problem is the delay from the time you push the button to the time the photo takes. It is NEVER immediate, and often takes half a second or more. This is fine for a posed shot, but good luck taking action shots or candid moments. You have to learn the art of predicting where people and objects will be in a half second. Do not buy this camera if you intend to take photos of people in action, i.e. playing sports. You will miss every key photo. I have not found any way around this--playing with the settings does not change the delay.<br />2) Dust collects in the viewfinder lens (on the outside). Not a major problem, but it's very difficult to clean.<br />3) The 2x optical zoom is indeed small. You will have moments where it frustrates you.<br />4) The flash is weak and does create bad red eye.<br />5) The custom USB connection point seems very delicate. I am concerned that in the future this will wear out (however, that is just a guess--no problems have occurred yet).<br />6) The tripod mount is in an awkward position (on the left, but the trigger button is on the right, so the camera tends to wiggle while shooting on a tripod).<br />As for the battery life, I have no problems. I've taken dozens of photos and movies (using the flash and the lcd screen) and it has lasted fine. No complaints there. The memory card is very small for taking hi-res pics, so you will have to get a bigger one.<br />This thing has changed my life. I slip it in my pocket everywhere I go, and it has not let me down. I would highly recommend getting one. Incredible quality + very few complaints.","In April of 2003, as a footnote to the purchase of my Canon G2, I bought a Digital Elph s230 for my wife .... This is a very popular, ultra-compact 3 MPixel 2x zoom camera. I won't do a full review of it, but here are some quick impressions. Overall I'm pretty awed by this camera. My wife took great photos with it, and she is neither a photo geek nor a computer geek. I highly recommend it. (Canon has since introduced the s400, which is one step up from this camera -- 3x zoom and 4 Mpixel -- for more money.)<br />It is incredibly small, feels very solid and tough. The model I bought is made in Japan. There are extensive manuals - with one major error: the manual doesn't make clear that to get the \"continuous shooting\" and \"infinity shot\" behaviors you have to switch from \"automatic\" to \"manual\" mode\". These modes are mislabelled; they should be \"simplified\" and \"standard\" mode. In the default \"automatic/simplified\" mode a number of the controls don't work (white balance, infinity, continuous shot). In the \"automatic/standard\" mode all the controls work. It took me a while to figure this out, the documentation really fell short on this critical point.<br />It supports the EXIF Orientation Tag. A sensor in the camera is used to document camera position at the time of image acquisition.<br />Uses CompactFlash, same AV output and data cable as the G2, the same desktop software and very similar camera interface and operations and similar CF card format. So if you are familiar with a G2 (or G1, G3) this is almost your only logical choice.<br /><br />Battery is very small, very nice charger that plus directly into a wall outlet (would not fit well on a surge suppressor). I think you really need two batteries with this camera. Note that even though the charger is reasonably elegant it's almost as big as the camera! The charger can handle 110/220V and 50/60 Hz.<br />Since a camera-plug charger is an unnecessary optional add-on, you really want to use a CF Card reader with your PC and don't bother using the data cable. My favorite CF card reader is hardly larger than the USB data cable, and arguably easier to transport.<br />Canon made a very nice case for this camera, the PSC 300, that was sold on Amazon for $...! It had a small pouch for a flash card. Naturally, it was discontinued. It's been replaced by the PSC-50, which is even smaller. As of April 2003 neither of these cases is available, the PSC-50 cases are on back order and the PSC 300 have been discontinued.","This is a fantastic camera!  I agonized over the purchase of a digicam and finally settled on this one - it was the right choice.<br />The size is a great feature.  I slip it into my pocket and always have it available.  As a result I have captured some great candid moments with my kids that I would have missed had I run to get the camera each time.<br />3 min video is great!  With the flick of a switch you can capture adequate video (up to 180 secs!) WITH SOUND!!  See above about capturing moments that were previously lost.<br />Battery life is impressive - I keep waiting for the battery alert to go on but this little camera keeps chugging away through filming, video taking, and playback.  I can take between 100 - 200 shots before having to switch batteries.  And these charge fully, fast.<br />Image quality is stunning, the included software is extremely useful and intuitive enabling you to bulk prepare photos for email by saving them as smaller images - no need to launch a separate photo editor just to reduce the size of the image for email or web.  I would lke a larger optical zoom (the s400 has 3x) but the digital zoom impressed me with its clarity.  The AV out cable is great allowing you to view all images and videos (WITH SOUND) on a standard TV.<br />I also purchased a 256MB CF card which allows for loads of picture taking at all resolutions.  And also get a spare battery to have ready to go.","I struggled with all the options of digi cams.  I've never taken lots of pictures, so I read up everything from  CCD size to megapixels to apperatures and shutter speeds.  I determined brands.  Sony was out due to the limitation of its (proprietary) Memory Stick.  Olympus was the front runner with options, models, features, and lowest prices.  Canon was second.<br />I started to like the features on the Canon PowerShot S230. ...  Put simply, this is some of the best money I've EVER spent.  I come from an industrial design background (sort of); and it is rare I ever say a product is nearly flawless in design, function, and value.  Trust me.<br />If you can only spend $200 or $250 on a camera, save up your rainy day funds.  Wait another month or two.  Drop $400 and never worry about a camera again-period.  You'll be happy for the 3.2 (true-not rated) MP's when you start shooting.  Images are so good, you'll want to have a good printer like the Canon i950 (4800x1200 dpi).  Images enlarge to 8x10 perfectly.  Never buy film again.  Change between 50 and 400 ISO frame to frame. Black and White is fantastic.  Sepia has that old world quality perfect for some pics of New Orleans.  The long shutter speed allowed me to shoot some cool shots that are \"instant Desktops\" for my Mac.  Downloading's a breeze.<br />Bottom line.  The S230 is a feature rich camera. It's size allows me to take it everywhere with me.  The Olympus D-5550 I assure you would not fit in my Triple5Soul cigarette belt-pouch.  My flash covers AT LEAST 15' of throw.  The only downsides?  Sometimes I need to fiddle with settings for a minute or two to get them right for a shot.  I mean: set ISO, white balance, light metering, color setting/b&w.  Then there's always the movie setting.  Took lots of video of my dog playing outdoors.  But hey!  I wanted more features and control over shots, right?  For the first time, I have it.  Oh, the \"red eye reduction\" feature doesn't work as well as I might've hoped.  Yes, it's only a 2x optical zoom.  That's the limitation of such a compact camera.  I do wish it was a 4x-6x (3x wouldn't make that much difference), then I remember I probably wouldn't be lugging that monstrous camera and couldn't be holding it right then.  I'm just glad I didn't buy a Nikon F1 or Canon AE-1 a few years ago.  The 35mm camera would sit while my compact Canon travels.  All these positive ratings aren't wrong.  It would be a mistake to buy anything else.","I shopped for a digital camera for about 2 months, I went through 2 cameras. Olympus D520 and Canon S200. I finally bought the Canon S230 and was not fully satisfied with the red-eye reduction. 80% of my pictures that were taken at night or in the dark with the red-eye reduction selected, have red-eye on the picture. With the sofware available now, it could be removed, but why pay so much for a camera that should do it by itself. I would pay more and get the new S400.","I have owned a few digital cameras in my time, and spent too much money on them I might add. This one was cheaper than the others, and as far as point and shoot goes, this one is the best. Easy to use and it takes great pictures with little hassle. The battery provided takes enough pictures on one charge to fill a 64 mb card. (about 111 shots in the largest size & 400 small shots) I am Impressed with the quality of the camera for the price. It fits comfortably in my pocket so I can take it with me everywhere, wich I do!","This is my first digital camera.  I think it is great.  This camera is very easy to use and with a little exploration and common sense, all of the options are very easy to use.  I've only had the camera for 2 weeks now, but it takes great pictures, and coupled up with the canon I850 Priner, 4x6 pictures are coming out just like photos developed from the store.  The color and detail are very impressive.<br />The only down side to the camera is the small 16 memory card.  I've already bought a larger one for not much cost, and now I can take plenty of pictures without running out of memory.","This is my first digital camera.  The S230 is perfect for general snapshot and fun family use (let's be honest, if you're looking for professional quality or aperature control, buy one that cost $1,000+!) I take it with me everywhere--the size makes it a cinch to tuck it in a pocket or a purse.  The metal body feels much better in your hand than most of the other camera's I looked at.<br />The pictures are of great quality and the video clip is a fun addition for less than $400.  It's incredibly easy to use, even for a digital novice.  With my Windows XP, interface with the card reader is easier than I could have imagined.<br />The panoramic stitch effect, while not perfect, captures the essence of the shot and, in some cases, is better than a traditional panoramic picture because you can decide the size.<br />I knew the red eye would be an issue when I bought it, but, then again, it's rather easy to get rid of that using the software provided by Canon.<br />My only complaint is a user error--because of the location of the on/off switch, I sometimes turn it off when taking a picture.  Like any digital camera, it will go through batteries quickly if you leave the camera on, review your pictures often, or take shots with the LCD on, but with generic batteries available, there is no reason not to have a spare.","I sold my Sony brick which used a floppy drive and now I take the tiny s230 everywhere.  Daytime pictures are very sharp, and the white balance seems very accurate in general.  There is some purple fringe with strong light, and I noticed some slight barrel distortion on a macro shot or two, but nothing showstopping.  I wish it had shutter and aperture priority modes, but it isn't a big deal--the camera was designed for quick snapshots.  If you want to do some creative work, you can, but it takes some patience, experimenting, and use of spot metering and focus.  I love the long exposure modes--I have taken many interesting night shots.  The battery life is okay if you don't use the flash or auto focus beam often, and you try to frame as many shots as possible with the viewfinder.  The screen is sharp, the menus are well laid out.  The lens, while zooming, is a bit noisy, but bearable, and the camera won't remember my flash preference in auto mode for some reason after turning it off.  One feature I love is being able to zoom in on a photo in playback mode.  Blurry shots often look sharp when they are reduced in the screen, but you can blow up certain areas to see if it is sharp or not.  This is useful for knowing which photos to throw out.  The bundled software is absolute garbage.  It is buggy, slow, and counterintuitive.  To transfer images, (assuming you have a laptop) get a seven-dollar pcmcia card adapter.  It has a smart flash that pre-flashes, meters, and adjusts the aperature accordingly.  On my previous camera, low, medium, and high flash modes left much to be desired.  On full-auto, it works very well.  Overall, very pleased.","I have been absolutely thrilled with the quality of photos, ease of use, durability, and compact size of this camera.  Shortly after I bought it, I took some pictures at the highest resolution, and had them professionally developed to 11x13 size.  The quality of the photo was outstanding!  The photo was crystal clear, and I'm certain that I could have blown it up further.  I previously owned a Kodak 2.0 mp, and although it took nice pictures, the delay (from pushing the button to the time the picture recorded) was nearly unbearable.  I constantly missed photo ops of my new baby in action.  My Kodak also began having problems after 18 months (what a dissapointment- of course it was then out of warranty).  The S230 is lightening quick, and the recovery (from shot to shot) is also extremely fast.  I found the software to be very intuitive, as well as easy to install (I'm running XP).  Although I have other photo software, I am using the Cannon software, because I find it that functional.  I did a lot of research in the way of compact cameras, before this puchase.  I considered the Sony Cyber Shot (average response time, and very high price), the Minolta Dimage(got sub-par reviews for quality of photo).  Three people in my family own the s200's, and have been thrilled with them for over 1 yr.  The proprietary battery concerned me prior to my purchase, but I have been extremely pleased with the battery performance.  I have not had the need to purchase a spare.  I set up the camera (fooling with ALL of the settings), took over 100 photos, reviewed them MANY times, and downloaded them from the camera, before I had to recharge the battery!  The battery also fully recharges in about 1 1/2 hours.  One neat extra: the camera has a gravity sensor that \"remembers\" the orientation of your photos, so they are always \"right side up\".  In low light conditions, the camera has performed far beyond my expectations (compensating with a very good flash).  Because of the compact size (and flash proximity to the shutter, red eye is occasionally a problem (although no more so then other ultra-compact cameras), and can be fixed with the software.  However red-eye is certainly no worse then my HUGE Kodak camera was.  If you are looking for a compact camera, with excellent photo quality, and intuitive features, look no further.","I love this camera, and I take it everywhere I can, cuz you never know when you might have a Kodak moment!  The only complaint I have is the redeye...even though it claims to have redeye reduction, boy is there a lot of it!  Oh well, nothing a little photoshop editing can't take care of.  Besides that, this is THE camera to get.","I also have to give this little beauty a high rating. A number of people have expressed complaints or problems. I thought I'd describe some of my own experiences.<br />I recently bought the camera for work, along with an extra battery and a 256MB CF card. In initial testing I was very impressed with the clarity of the pictures, though I changed the white balance for indoor pictures. I took 110 pictures of varying sizes and 3 movies of about a minute each (much more than I expected, based on reviews I've read of battery life). This week my wife and I went to Disneyland. I brought the camera, the empty CF card and both charged batteries. I took 182 pix at max size/min compression without depleting the first battery! Ultimately, I got 328 pictures over a period of two weeks - about half taken with flash. I kept the LCD display off the whole time, except for the two-second review display in the LCD after you take a picture and the status icons which appear when you change something (like turning the flash off or forcing infinity focus).<br />The review display defaults to 10 seconds, but as I grew comfortable with the camera I changed it to 2 seconds -- partly to conserve battery life, but also because you can't do anything with the camera until the display clears. By the last day of our trip, I had turned if off entirely due to the discovery of an undocumented feature: if the LCD and review settings are both off, and you keep the shutter button pressed after taking your image, the image will be displayed for a few seconds. This has the potential to decrease the time between shots if you're busy taking several in a row in a short time.<br />I have an SLR 35mm camera and two point-and-shoot's. Though I like looking through the lens to exactly frame a picture in the SLR, I've learned with the point-and-shoot's to see as the camera does and not worry about the viewfinder. I took this point-and-shoot approach with the S230 and it works fine. If you think \"digital camera\" means \"looking at an LCD display to frame your picture,\" I urge you to rethink this. It will mean far less worry about the battery. It should be noted though, as it is elsewhere, that the \"weak battery\" icon doesn't come on until the battery is pretty much dead, which means you could end up in the lurch if you don't have a spare; but the battery life is less of a problem than I thought.<br />In different stores I took many macro mode close-ups with the flash off, which requires a slow shutter setting for the dim light. They weren't as blurry as I thought they'd be, and a couple came out great. A pocket tripod would make the blurriness problem moot, of course. A curious feature of CCD digital cameras you need to understand is that longer exposures create grainier (more artifacts) pictures, exactly the opposite of what you can get with film. Flash pictures of 8-foot circular displays, taken from 4 or 5 feet back, came out quite well, and hand-held macro pictures under sufficient light were very nice.<br />I switched from auto mode to manual (mostly to access the white balance settings) early on. When turning on the camera in manual mode, you only have to think about a few things: Whether to set infinity focus (in situations where you're shooting something more than 10 feet away and don't want to wait for the auto-focus); whether to set macro mode for sharp close-ups up to 1.5 feet away (not commonly used, but handy); and whether to turn the flash on or off. To review several pictures you've taken, just flick the mode switch from photo to review.<br />Images will tend to have more contrast than you see with your eye, a bit more than with film. If you're within 8 to 10 feet, use a fill flash. Alternately you can work with images in the provided software (Photoshop Elements). For example, I shot some photos of the Small World exterior late in the afternoon. The sun shone brightly off the white building, and the shrubs and waiting area were in shadow. I aimed at the building and half-pressed the shutter to set the auto-exposure. In that image, the building looked fine, but the shadows were were almost black, even though they were easily visible to my eye. In a second photo, I aimed the camera at the shadows to set the auto-exposure, and then aimed at the building and took the picture. In this image, the building and surrounding area was completely washed out, but the shrubs and passing boats in the darker areas were much more distinct. I fixed the first image in Photoshop, but the second image couldn't be saved. I did this to test the camera's limits, but the best solution would have been to come back and shoot it in the morning. A common \"bad photo\" problem is not understanding when you need to recompose a shot, change the lighting (or wait for better lighting), or not accepting that you just can't get certain photos to come out.<br />For those special photos it's still not time to replace my SLR, or even my point-and-shoot APS camera. But for the size, weight, and quality of images, even though I purchased the camera for work, I'm very happy with it and will use it for personal uses as well.","i've had it for a while now and am extremely happy with it. the battery life is just fine, the optical zoom is a plus because its greatest feature is its small size. its very portable and it can be taken anywhere. oh, and the 3.2 megapixel photos turn out great.","I'm not going to repeat everything the other reviewers said, just emphasize that this little camera can take 3 minute long movies at 320x240 resolution, which when viewed on a TV come out amazingly sharp and fluid with fairly good sound.<br />I used it a lot during my last vacation and then stitched the movies together using the EO Video software (not included with camera) to make one long movie with different scenes.  So many small 1 minute to 3 minute movie clips add up to a decent show.<br />The camera is very easy to use for movies since you don't have to keep the shutter pressed, just press it once to start recording and again to stop.  You can easily hold it up over people's heads in crowds, but the funniest is to film unsuspecting friends, since they would never imagine being filmed by this little thing.  Make sure you get at least a 256 MB CF Card with a high 25x speed rating so that you don't have to wait long for the camera to write the data.  I found such a 256MB 25x CF card manufactured by Transcend for only...","I got this camera because of the 3.2 MP and the size.<br />It fits in my purse, my pocket, in my glovebox in my car.<br />It takes awesome photos.  If you are at a concert and do not want to have a camera detected, this is your best friend.  You can turn the flash off and take a good shot without anyone ever knowing.  Want to photograph your computer screen?  Get a nice clean shot with the flash turned off the camera.  Always wonder why the heck you don't have your camera when you need one?  This will solve your problem.  You'll find you'll never leave the house without it again.  I have photographed dragonflies, people, places, car accidents and more because of the fact that this camera is so easy to carry around, therefore I get 1,000 more opportunities to take photos.  Photo and print quality is astounding for it's class.","I first saw my friend's Elph S200 (the 2MP one) and was amazed at how small it was and the quality of the pictures and product.  That day, I decided that when the 3 MP version (the S230) came down a little in price, I would buy one.<br />Now that I got the camera, I am even more amazed.  It is a precision instrument.  For the camera itself, probably its only limitation is the 2x zoom.  However, with the digital zoom, you get 6.4x.  Granted, with the digital zoom, the pictures can get grainy.  However, with 3 megapixel, the digitally zoomed pictures are still better than with my old 1.2 megapixel camera which made decent 4x6 shots.<br />I had problems installing the software on my home PC which runs Windows XP (it is a three year old PC).  The Installshield failed.  I contacted Canon and they gave me a suggestion that didn't work.  Upon contacting them again, they told me it was a Windows problem and told me to contact Microsoft.  I was not happy about that.<br />Luckily, I already had a CF reader which I use to get the pictures onto the PC which is probably a good investment anyway.  I also use Photoshop Elements 2.0 which is better than the software they give.  The software did install on my laptop running Windows XP, but still Photoshop Elements is better than theirs and it is easier using a separate CF reader than using the Canon-supplied cable.<br />Even with my software problems, this camera still rates 5 stars.  It is simply amazing how Canon fit so much camera into such a tiny package.  Any software problems can't get worked around and my home PC is not new either.","Without a doubt this is the best camara I ever bouhgt. It's small enough to place in your pocket or in the case of my wife in her purse. She carried everywere and we have the most incredible pictures from us and kids. Easy to download pictures to your computer and the quality with the 3.2 megapixels is amazing. Definatly a must have. To bad is not chip enough for averybody to have one.","I've been taking digital photos for the past 6 years and waiting to replace my coolpix 1MP (It cost a small fortune 6 years ago). I just couldn't wait any longer and did my research only to realize the digital camera I really wanted (basically an SLR)is still way out of my price range.<br />I decided to look for a compact camera I would use even if I had that great camera.  One for keeping with me at all times. It needed to be small compact and sturdy.  I have a tendancy to drop things.  Online I did my research and I took a friends Kodak on vacation. While the Kodak was easy to use it has an odd way of compressing memory and the display is not the best so I ruled those out. In the end the S230 fit the bill.  Then I get on here only to read about red eye problems...back to do more research.  I found a site with reviews and photos taken for comparison. Sony's DSC-P9 (4MP) was the best option I came up with but I couldn't get past the soft look to the photos. The Fuji camera's had alot of noise that was visible on screen. (It doesn't show up when you print the photos.)  The Sony had it's share share of noise also.  The Canon's photos were sharp and clear with little visible noise.  I believe even better than some higher MP models. So I decided I could put up with fixing the red eye.<br />Best choice I could have made. This camera is wonderful. It is small, well made and has easy to use buttons.  The features are set up in a logical manner that make them simple to remember. The screen is excellent. The camera does have some weight to it even though it is so small.  I find this to be useful when I'm trying to hold the camera steady to take low light photos.  The camera is quick to turn on and is ready to shoot within seconds.  There are not long delays while it waits to change modes either.<br />There is still the issue with red eye if you are not at the same level and angle with the subject. (And it's alarming) But the software included is super easy to use and takes care of the problem better than the Adobe softwares I've used in the past.  The pictures download fast and are stored in folders by the date taken.  Perfect for sequencing pictures of the kids.<br />The battery life is excellent but when the warning light comes on you've only got about 60 seconds to take that last picture. The battery takes 2 hours to charge from empty. The charger fits directly into the outlet and stores flat. (No cords!) The extras you'll need (Including a reader so you won't waste battery life on downloads) will add a third or a forth to the cost of this camera. The movies are fun and easy to send to family. There are also some manual picture taking features that are useful to get good pictures in low light without the flash.<br />I've had the camera for 2 weeks and I really can't say enough about the quality.","I have had a Canon digital camera for a few years now... had the A50.  At the time it was the world's smallest 1.3 megapixel camera.  That camera worked great and finally I updated to the new S230.  WOW!!! what a great new camera.  Takes great pics and is much faster than the old A50.<br />The movie mode is great for quick little movies.  I do construction management and take short movies of remodel projects in progress.<br />The best small digital camera I think you can buy.  Its small, takes great pics, has great features and is easy to use.. buy it!!","I own a G2 also, but the ELPH is the one to slide in your pocket everytime. Light and small, but feels as sturdy as a block of steel in your hand. The video mode records 180 seconds per clip in 320 mode, not many other cameras can do this. Very fast cycle time between photos.<br />Cons: None in 3 months","A lot of people wrote in their raved reviews and opinions about this camera. I agree with all the satisfied owners that s230 is a great 3.2 megapix camera-accurate colors, well adjusted white balance, intuitive, user-friendly menus and adjustments and so on.<br />However, one complaint that I have (a complaint that I have not read any where else but I think people should know about) is that in order to recharge the battery, you have to take it out of the camera and slide it in the charger unit. This worries me  because 1) the camera will reset when battery is taken out for a while, and I will have to go through setting it up again, like time and date and whatever the manual settings I have chosen.  2) there will be more wear and tear from taking it in and out many times.<br />This is definitely a scheme for consumers to buy a second battery, because in the manual, p21 it says, \"battery charge is insufficient to operate the camera, replace the battery pack immediately.\"<br />Yes, you will spend more than what you think because you will most likely buy another battery and a higher capacity memory card. Or, if you decided not to get a second battery, you might have want the AC adaptor ACK500 to keep the camera active to prevent resetting.","So, I recently purchased a Canon Powershot s230 earlier this month (Feb/2003) after weeks of angsty buyer's indecision.  I was torn between the s330 powershot (which has a 3x Optical Zoom but only 2 megapixels) and the s230 (which has a 2x Optical Zoom and 3.2 megapixels).  This camera will go with me on an upcoming overseas trip, and I was torn by a single question: will megapixels or optical zoom give me a better photo? (as you can see, I am not an aficiando in digicams -- this purchase is actually my very first digital camera).  For me, ultra-portability is a necessity as I need to pack as lightly as possible.  I had decided against Canon's impressive, feature-laden s30 (which is only slightly larger than the s330) because the lens covers on the store models that I had seen had almost been ripped off, and I was concerned that it wouldn't stand up to moderate travel bag abuse (with or without a case).<br />I read every review of the two cameras that I could find, read a zillion newsgroup postings, and asked three people who work with cameras professionally what their opinions were.  I had thought that I had made up my mind to go for the s330 and save myself $100 (the reviews of both cameras are excellent, and I had decided to use the saved $$ to buy accessories).  But the 3 professional opinions that I'd sought out all agreed with buying the s230.  Their reasoning?  If you buy the camera with more megapixels, then when you use the _digital_ zoom to go to 3x, the extra megapixels will help give you the same image that would be gotten from a 2MP + 3x optical zoom combo.  This makes sense if you think about _digital_ zooming as taking a cropped portion of a picture, and simply blowing it up.  More megapixels means more granularity and picture detail -- so taking a piece of an image and making it larger won't affect detail and clarity as much as if you started out with fewer pixels in the first place.  Either way, when I got my hands on a working s230 store model and tested what 2x (optical) and \"3x\" (digital) zoom looked like on that camera, I realized that the difference in what you can see via those telephoto settings isn't that important.  In other words, both 2x and 3x aren't going to let you take a picture of someone from across a field -- they're snapshot quality zooms.<br />So that got me thinking.  I realized, too, that 3.2MP means excellent 8x10 photos.  I don't usually print that large, but hey! this is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime sort of trip, and I wanted the option to make a large print if necessary.  Also, my normal 5x7's would come out supersharp.  And 3MP also means that you can crop and edit pics without nearly as much loss in picture quality.<br />So I bought the s230.  My impressions?<br />The camera takes amazing daytime pics.  I was afraid handshake would be a problem, but I've had no trouble with that at all, except under low light conditions when I try to snap photos without using a flash (and then, it's not really \"shake\" that's the problem -- just lighting).  Oddly enough, despite expectations, I have NOT had red-eye problems...yet.  I've used the preset white balance settings, and my indoor pics have turned out with totally natural colors.  The LCD is awesome.  Panoramic pics are AMAZING (it is such a cool, cool feature).  With the included 16MB CF card, I've taken 45\" of video in 320x640 (I didn't expect to care about this feature, but I've had a BLAST taking quick videos).  As for zoom, I've noticed that, if I take large, superfine shots and then crop what I want to focus on, the resulting image looks the same as if I'd zoomed A LOT.  So, zoom has ended up being a moot purchasing factor for me.<br />All in all, this camera (and it's picture quality) have met and exceeded my expectations.  I was nervous to plunk down $... for something so small and after reading so many mixed reviews, but I have not had one iota of buyer's regret.  My advice?<br />Just buy it! :-)","I agonized for weeks (months) over this purchase -- and a printer to go with it. Was my Xmas gift for myself. The size, feel and features are all great pluses. The LCD screen is not as good or as big as big brother Canon S30s and S40s, but it does the job. The 3 minute vid clips (30 secs on 600x480 res that looks amazing) is also a GREAT add-on. And fun. But you buy a camera for its picture quality. I focused on Canon because of quality. But I really focused on the Elph because of size. Some of the Fuji cams were cool looking but try fitting the zoom ones in your pocket. Anyway, I digress. Since this was my first digital camera, I had a big learning curve. I have to say, some basic knowledge of light and aperture is a plus. Luckily I had some .. very basic. But each week my pics get better and better. The big key, esp. at night when you are playing with lighting settings, is to keep deadly still otherwise it all blurs. But the automatic function settings work fine. Anyhoo, I digress. My first pics, printed on a Canon S820 photo printer bowled me over. Better than anything from the quick processing at the drug store. WOW.<br />My only complaints:<br />1) red eye is bad, but that is why you have digital imaging software to remove it. But unless you're adapt at using such things, it can be a pain and time consuming.<br />2) pictures using flash all have somewhat of a blown out quality. It may be that I just havent learned to use it. But basically a flash is NOT needed in most decently lit spaces.<br />And at night, you get much better quality by using the camera's slow speed settings and, like i said, being deadly still.<br />Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend!!","I recently sold my Canon S30. While it was an EXCELLENT camera, I still found myself wanting a more compact design. It wasn't difficult to decide upon the S230 from the Digital ELPH line of camera's once they had a 3.2MP version.<br />I'll say this, everything about this camera is top notch. If your looking for a high quality, well built camera that easily fits in your pocket, look no further.<br />Only bad thing I can think of is the rubber door that covers the proprietary connection port on the side of the camera. It seems pretty flimsy and eventually with enough opening and closing may just wear off. It's a very thin piece of rubber. Other then that, that's all I can think of.<br />You can try and knock the flash or the weak optical zoom, but if you consider the size of camera your working with I'd say they are more then adequate. If you need a lot of flash power, or a big zoom lense, look for another camera.","I was a little skeptical at first about buying a digital camera because I wasnt sure if it was time to adopt the technology.  Like most people I read constant reviews here and there and came to one conclusion...this was the best camera out there for the money.  Canon has always been a leading company with cameras and they proved it to me.  This was easily my best purchase in recent memory.  On a Mac computer iphoto automatically recognizes the camera and downloads your pictures (time to buy a mac people).  The pictures are crisp and clear.  It even handles moving objects very well unlike the lower end model S200.  I love how compact it is and I can just slip it in my pocket and its not even a nuissance.  The design is amazing and very durable.  The menu options, etc is easy to use/set-up and I didnt even have to look in the manual.  You will be stunned at how easy it is to operate.  One word of advice, buy a bigger memory card, b/c the factory one holds next to nothing.  I purchased a 256Mb card, I suggest you do the same.  If you buy another digital camera other than this one....big mistake!!!","This is the 4th generation of what started as the S100 camera.  I had an S100 and held off on buying a new one until this one came along - the upgrade to 3.2MP - along with the all the other improvements made in the S110 and then S200 cameras that came in between (my brother bought an S200 having seen my S100, a friend bought an S110) - this was the one to get.<br />The software it comes with is \"OK\" - better than most stuff I've seen for this purpose but I mostly find myself just using the built-in stuff for photos in XP.  The images though, are incredible - especially for such a tiny camera.<br />Strong Points:<br />- Image quality is fantastic.<br />- Camera moves around pictures and moves between modes faster than earlier revs - very nice.<br />- Movie mode allows for up to 3 minutes of video at a time at low or med res - this is often as long as you'll ever want unless you're recording an entire event (in which case get a camcorder :)<br />Weak Points:<br />- The flash doesn't cut it in many lighting situations, I think you'd have trouble finding any camera this small though with an effective flash.<br />David","The reason I purchased this camera is for the convenience of having such a tiny digital camera without giving up too many features.  The 3.2MP is more than sufficient to take excellent photos and the MPEG feature (although I don't use it that much) was very easy to use and turned out a good product.  I have two complaints, however, and if these two things are bothersome, it would be wise to look elsewhere for a different model.  First complaint is that it gets hot when it's been on a while - not extreme heat, but enough to comment about it.  Second complaint is that it only has a 2X optical zoom.  Although it has a 6.4X digital zoom, it gets quite \"pixely\" when used.<br />So far I've been extremely pleased with my S230 as far as picture and image quality as well as its convenience and user-friendliness.  I highly recommend it.","We were looking to upgrade from the much bigger / bulkier Sony mavica. After plenty of research, we chose the Canon S230 - mainly for its VERY compact size and light weight. I give it 5 stars for portability. It literally fits in a shirt pocket.<br />The quality of the images are good - but a little \"hit and miss\". The 2x zoom is a shortcoming, and many photos turn out \"soft\". The red eye reduction feature is not very effective.<br />Overall, we're pleased with the S230....but don't expect perfection.","There are some faults with the Canon S230 but they don't diminish the overall quality of this little camera.  I previously reviewed this in December when I first purchased it and still rate it as five stars, but I will comment on some disadvantages now.<br />First is the red eye that appears on indoor, flash photos.  This is true of most small digital cameras that I have used.  The problem is the location of the flash close to the lens- unavoidable if you want small size.  I've mitigated this by putting translucent tape or paper over the flash to lessen its impact or taking pictures without flash if possible.<br />The next problem is the battery.  It works great and stays charged through many photos, videos and reviews of my pictures.  It does not let me know when it is about to run out of power.  As soon as the indicator for a low battery comes on the camera dies.  This does not allow much time for changing batteries in the midst of an important event.  My suggestion is to have an extra battery and to always use a newly charged battery for important events.<br />Now for some great features;  I dropped this camera twice onto hard cement and the metal casing and components survived unscathed.  I take this camera with me to sports events, skiing and hiking.  The humidity of our school pool at swim meets has posed no problem.  Its nice to know that it can stand up to even my carelessness.<br />The video clips are great. At an event I simply video each part individually.  Three minutes is long enough for each race in a swim meet- even the relays (Okay, not the 500 free, but my arm would tire from that one anyway). I taped my son's All County orchestra concert- each piece was about three minutes- and even the sound was pretty good. I use a 128 MB card and can get at least a few events on each card.  The 256 MB can do more.<br />So far I'm still very happy with this camera.","The PowerShot S230 is my first digital camera.  The very first impression after having taken several shots with the S230 - \"I can't believe this small camera can produce such amazing images.\"  Sharpness, color saturation and balance, exposure - there's nothing to complain about.  The build and overall quality are great, the camera is small, but feels very solid.  Another pleasant aspect is the number of professional-like manual features the camera packs.  From my point of view, the only primary \"professional\" feature that's not there is aperture/shutter priority.  Nevertheless, the camera gives you a lot more control than any 35mm film point-and-shoot camera.  Having used the camera for a while, I can't see any reason why anyone would ever go back to film.  Now, some people have been complaining about the flash red-eye effect.  Well, that I just can't understand.  I have this thirty dollar digital image editing software from Microsoft.  It takes me about 10 seconds to remove red eye from any picture taken with the S230.  I bought three add-ons for this camera: the dedicated Canon bag, a 256MB CF card, and a spare battery.  To summarize, if you are not a professional photographer, but just need to take excellent pictures of your vacations, family, ball games, etc. - this is the camera for you.  It's light, compact, and affordable and produces great results.","Had the camera for about 2 weeks and I love it.  Great pictures!  It is very small and I really like the metal body.  I recommend getting a bigger flash card, I am going to buy a 128 MB card.  Prices are coming down and Amazon has a bunch of them to choose from.  I also recommend a card reader, instead of hooking the camera up to the pc.  Long story short, I read reviews for at least a month, and finally picked this camera over the sony P7.  Very happy with it so far...","I started out with a s200 6 months back, only after doing extensive research on available small digital cameras. Small size was most important to me as I had been using a SLR full size before this, and found that for the money i had spent on that camera, it was not being used to its fullest potential- simply because it is not the type of camera for the amateur photographer- too large and not practical.<br />The elph range seemed the most appealing, especially when considering the features. My only gripe at the time was that it was without a higher MP range.<br />As soon as i found out the s230 had come out, it was certain that this was the upgrade i wanted. The Elph is a fantastic package, with its small size and solid build being its greatest advantages (among so many others). As most other reviewers have stated, it has a rather weak flash, and its low-light pictures aren't as good (as with the s200)- but its when those quick \"point-and-shoot\" moments come along that this camera shines its brightest. There's no fidgeting, and no long start up. Just turn it on and take the picture.<br />Now, if only Canon can squeeze a higher optical zoom into this little wizard.....!<br />Strongly recommend this camera for the amateur/start up digital photographer. Many moments of photographic fun guaranteed!","Several friends & co-workers have the older 2 megapixel PowerShot models.. from the S110 to the S200. I've always been fascinated by these cameras and their carryability, but being a person who likes image quality I waited and waited (and waited) until Canon finally came through with the S230 with 3.2 megapixels. What a great camera, I bought it just before going on a week long snowboarding trip to Canada. Litteraly took it everywhere. It performed nearly flawlessly in every situation. It handled the cold & condensation just fine, and night shots at the bars came out great. The only small gripe I have is that the 9 point autofocus does wierd things, causing the occasional blurred shot. The improvement of the movie mode (now you can shoot 3 minutes instead of only 30 seconds at 320x240, as well as the ability to shoot 640x480) was a great move on Canon's part. The microphone does well except in loud or windy situations where the audio will clip. The only weak part on the camera body is the compact flash door which is plastic, a friend broke his off. Software: Most of the software works ok, the only thing that works kindof iffy on my machine (win2k) is the zoombrowser software. I went out and spent $20 on a usb compactflash card reader and now use that to transfer my pictures, plus it works as a portable disk to tranfer other files between home/work/friends. You can get 128mb flash cards for about $40 now, definitely pick one up, the 16mb card is useless except as a backup. An extra battery would be helpful, or just carry the charger (it's the same size as the camera) and charge it up at lunchtime or some other downtime. I used my camera throughout the day and only had to charge at night for an hour or so. All in all, it's a great camera, would like to see Canon squeeze a 3x optical zoom into the next version, but if it makes the camera any bigger I'd likely not carry it. The combination of size, quality and features of this camera are unmatched!","This is an excellent camera.  I like both the size of the camera and the quality of the images that are produced.  I mainly use the camera to take pictures of friends and family and I also use the camera to take pictures of Surgical cases in the Operating Room and the detail is excellent for both uses.  I have compared the pictures created by this camera to that of my father's much more expensive Nikon CoolPix 990 and the quality is almost identical.  Both cameras have a resolution over 3 megapixels however the S230 doesn't have the bulky size of the Nikon.  The Compact Flash memory card is the way to go.  I didn't even install the software that came with the camera because I use a SanDisk external USB Compact Flash reader and the transfer is very fast.  I use a 128mb Compact Flash Card and on the middle quality setting I can take 380 images which more than satisfies me.  I assume with a 256mb card you can take twice that number.  The camera also takes motion pictures which also comes out with very high quality.  I also appreciate the automatic rotate feature.  Any feature you can find on other cameras can be found on this camera combined with the great compact size which fits in my shirt pocket.  I would suggest purchasing an extra Lithium Ion Battery with the camera because I am able to take 80 pictures/battery charge with the display on and around 120 pictures/battery charge with the display off.  I also recommend the PSC-300 soft case.  If you can get over the ugly purple color it is a compact case which fits the camera perfectly and provides easy storage and transportation of an extra battery and an extra compact flash card.  I enjoy using my camera and I feel that it will not be obsolete for some time.","I still havent delved into the cameras compensation mode but this Camera could not be simpler to use. Its still a bit pricey but compared to all the other digital cameras of its kind (and ive seen many) its worth the price. I think the LCD display takes too much battery power and the flash is too close to the lens but it is a very handy and smart camera. If you like small and well constructed things the likes of how Macintosh makes, (IPOD)you will like this camera. Its ability to take a good picture is 90% and to take the picture you want is 80%. Meaning youve got to put some work into changing the presets to get what you were hoping for but the beauty of digital is that its so manipulable.","Canon is coming close to perfection here.  Any smaller and it would be difficult to operate with adult hands.<br />Skip the Canon software and use a compact flash card reader for getting originals into your computer.  If you're a Mac user, Cameraid and GraphicConverter will handle most beginner needs.<br />Buy a larger CF card and at least one spare battery.<br />If you don't have a computer or don't know how to use the one you own, don't bother with any digital camera.  And No, Email and web browsing don't count as knowing how to use a computer.","My experience is that 2.1 mepixel digital camera can produce equal to or better 8\"x10\" picture than 35mm camera(I used to do wedding photo's).  Thus I didn't need a digital camera above 3.2 mp.  I wanted a good balance of weight/size, and cost, and features.  S230 weight/size is unmatched with beautiful stainless steel brushed face.  The camera is full of great features:  new image processing system, good lense, new focusing system, strong Li-I battery, and digital camera with adequate camcorder features.  Camcorder feature is very high quality though bit choppy.  The Flash, the weakest side of any point-and-shoot camera, is much better than my previous digital camera (Canon S10).  Only feature I wished it has is external flash hotsynch wire connection.  New Zoombrowser software is much better in handling database then previous versions, but lacks grace.  Mouse Scroll does not work.  Awkward way of deleting shots from the camera after downloading.  Should have given Adobe Photo Element instead of Archsoft stuff.","You cannot beat this camera for size/performance ratio. It's tiny, the spapshots are generally good, the controls are easy to use and powerful, and it's got great start up and shot to shot times. I'm not totally convinced by the AiAF (autofocus) yet. Some shots I have taken seem a bit blurry, when I know the subject was focused properly. Mostly low light shots it seems. The size is perfect. Stealthy. Keep it in your pocket and only those with a keen eye notice when you pull it out. You'll be taking more shots than you ever thought possible.<br />Manual control of the camera is also powerful for a small point and shoot. There is a long shutter setting up to 15 seconds. There are manual exposure, white balance and ISO settings. Macros are good. The panorama setting is awesome, string together many picts for a great 360 shot. Movies are good too. Long! Best of all I love how the camera remembers its last setting so that when you power it off and back on it's right where you left it.<br />Some issues however:<br />1. The flash is weak. It's good if your just feet away from the subject, but that's about it. If you want to catch something in the distance at night your going to have to turn the flash off and pump up the exposure. Get a tripod for this.<br />2. Red eye galore. The red eye prevention doesn't appear to work very well.","I recieved an Olympus C-3000 last year for Christmas.  I had already been shopping around, and knew what I really wanted was the Canon S30 based on image quality.  I didn't want a camera (like the C3000Z) that required me to \"fix\" the color on every picture I took. (The C3000Z images really weren't that good.)  I quickly sold the C3000Z and held off buying a digital camera for another year until the S30 price came down a bit.<br />Enter the S230, which I ended up buying instead.  I took the S230 with me on vacation to Disney/MGM/Epcot/Islands of Adventure/etc. last week, and I LOVE THIS CAMERA.  The pictures it took make me look like a pro.  Even the night shots of the Epcot laser/light/fireworks show came out spectacular.  What impressed me the most was how quickly the camera was able to take pictures and write them to memory.  The fireworks pictures frame together perfectly, showing a launch, rise, and glorious explosion of each rocket.<br />Other well-done feature include the stitching of pictures into panoramic photos, cropping of videos on-camera, and the overall intuitive design of the buttons and menus.  You can just about use every feature of the camera without ever reading the manual.  Very easy to use.  The LCD display is crisp and relatively easy to view in daylight.  I'd love a slightly larger LCD, but it would make the camera larger and heavier.<br />The battery life (I bought a second one for travel) is excellent, and the charge time is pretty quick, too.  A single charge pretty much lasted me an entire day (14 hrs), which included lots and lots of power cycles (on/off).  I will say that turning the camera on and off eats battery quickly (probably because of the mechanics and such to open the lens), but if you just let the auto-power off do its thing, you'll be happy.  In my case, it rained a fair bit, so I turned it on and off more often.<br />I would like to see some better software included, and I did run into a problem with some corrupted images on one of my CF cards that caused the software to BSOD my system, but I'm sure it's a defective CF card (my other 4 cards work fine).  Still, some error handling would have been nice in the software as opposed to blue-screening my system.  (Try it sometime -- pull the USB cable out while it's transferring pics... boom!)<br />More so, the movies look better than many of the dedicated digital video cameras I've seen in years past.  For the money, this camera is a _pure_gem_.","My Cannon S230 arrived last week...  I took it skiing today and it is perfect for the outdoors...  The size is the most incredible and useful thing about it... it's a camera that you don't have to debate whether it's worth lugging around... you'll forget that you are carrying it... Even though it's tiny, it was pretty easy to use with gloves on... the auto-closing lens \"cap\" is key, and it's difficult to turn the camera on by mistake.  The battery lasted all day in the cold...","WHY I PURCHASED THE POWERSHOT 230:<br />I was never really a fan of Canon cameras, especially Canon digital cameras. It wasn't until recently that a few of my friends were sending me pictures via email that were taken with a Canon Powershot camera. I was pretty impressed with the results and decided to check out the newest Powershot; the S230. This camera packed a lot of features, but kept the bulk to a minimum. Producing images at 3.2 megapixels, the S230 was definitely appealing.<br />WHAT IT COMES WITH:<br />- Canon PowerShot S230 Digital ELPH camera<br />- NB-1LH Lithium-ion battery<br />- 16 MB CompactFlash (CF) Card<br />- USB cable<br />- A/V cable<br />- Wrist Strap<br />- CD with Canon software suite<br />- Users Manual<br />POCKETABILITY:<br />The first thing you notice about this camera is that it's small. Probably the smallest digital camera I've seen in the 3 megapixel category. You can truly put this in your pocket and not have everyone stare at the bulge...<br />DURABILITY:<br />I've already dropped this camera once on my hardwood floor. Amazingly, it still works like a charm. The S230 is encased in stainless steel with a few chrome accents and a couple of plastic parts (mainly the switches & dials). I expect this camera to last several years without any problems, if not longer. A buddy of mine has owned his Powershot S100 for over two years and he still loves his to death.<br />EASE OF USE:<br />The S230 was as easy to use (if not easier) as my previous Sony digital cameras. Before selling my Sony DSC-S75, I had the chance to compare the two, side-by-side. The size alone, gave the S230 an overwhelming advantage. The picture quality is very impressive with the S230. The indoor photos that I took without the flash turned out great. The auto-exposure, as well as the auto-ISO settings works fine, but if you want to manually set those on your own, it's easy to do. There are other cool features on the S230 such as picture effects (black and white, sepia, soft, sharp, etc.). The 1.5\" LCD is very useful and is very clear, even in bright sunlight.<br />ADVANCED FOCUSING:<br />AiAF (Artificial Intelligence Auto-Focus) is a new feature found on the S230 that was not present in the earlier models of the Powershots. This function allows the S230 to select from one of the nine focus areas within the frame to capture the sharpest shot. It's pretty amazing how this works. This feature can also easily be turned off in the settings. This feature is found on the new Canon G3, as well, and is the flagship of the point-and-shoot digital camera line for Canon.<br />PICTURE QUALITY:<br />As I mentioned, I was quite impressed with the photo quality. I managed to print some of them on photo paper using my HP 960c deskjet printer. Printing them in 5X7 produced brilliant, almost photolab quality pictures. I might add that my Sony DSC-S75 also produces some of the best photos, as well, but I expect that from a camera that boasts a Carl Zeiss Sonar lens, 3.3 megapixel resolution quality.... If you own a Canon printer, you should be able to directly print off of your S230 using the supplied cable. I just ordered the Canon i850 printer, so I'm anxiously waiting to try it out.<br />VIDEO MODE:<br />The ability to capture 30 seconds of 640X480 AVI video (20 frames per second) with sound is awesome! My father was surprised at how clearly it captures motion video. Although you're able to capture the video with sound, you won't be able to play it back with sound on the camera itself, as it is not equipped with a speaker. The S230 is capable of capturing more than 30 seconds if you use smaller resolution. After visiting the Canon Powershot website, I learned that if you use a high-speed CompactFlash (CF) card, you should be able to capture more than 30 seconds of 640X480 video. Canon expects to market the high speed CF card soon.<br />BATTERY STRENGTH:<br />This is where I'd say that my Sony DSC-S75 shines. All of Sony's digital cameras display the remaining life of the battery in minutes. The S230 goes strong until there's about 5% or less power left. I've read a few articles and reviews stating that the battery life is the weakness of this camera, but it's not all that bad. It all depends on how much you use the LCD display, the flash, and how often you turn on/off the device. I quickly ordered an extra battery from buy.com and I'm perfectly happy now.<br />The S230 comes with a separate battery charger. This is very convenient, as you don't have to charge the battery using the camera, like most of the Sony cameras do (Sony sells the battery charger as a separate accessory). From a fully discharged battery, the charger is able to completely charge it in about two hours. There is an LED which displays in `red' when it's charging and `green' when it's complete.<br />OVERALL WEAKNESSES:<br />Some people will say that the small size can be a weakness, but I'd say that the size is definitely its strength. The optical zoom capability is only 2X, so you won't be able to zoom up very closely from afar. It does offer a digital zoom, but this may result in grainy photos. The macro mode of the S230 isn't as crisp as my Sony DSC-S75, but I can live with it. Also, the flash on the S230 isn't as effective as it should be. The flash tends to white out (too bright) close-range subjects, but is very weak for any subjects more than 6 feet away. I'll have to play around some more with the settings, I guess. Finally, the tripod mount is not positioned in the center of the camera. It's actually placed on the side, causing it to be off-center and hard to balance.<br />SUMMARY:<br />I mainly purchased this camera for its size, but it's turned out to be a much better camera than I anticipated. In terms of photo quality, it may not beat the higher-end digital cameras, but it will sure give them a run for the money. We have to hand it Canon for developing a truly pocket-sized 3.2 megapixel digital camera.","I replaced an old Olympus D340 with the S230. The pictures are fantastic and the video is also very good. It is easy to use and is smaller than the S330 and the S200. You won't be disappointed. I recommend that you buy a 256mb card since each 30 seconds of video at 640x480 is about 11.5mb. My 128mb cards get filled up fast when taking video.","I got this IXUS V3(powershot s230 ELPH)just 2 nights ago and has taken close to 150 shots. This is my first digital camera which i got after months of research. I was skeptical about the small size as it makes the handling of the camera a lot harder but it turned out otherwise. The photo quality was astonishing for both indoor and out door shots.Pictures taken in perfect darkness turned out as if i had taken them during the day while day-shots turned out vividly. I was disappointed by the flash when taking macro objects as the falsh did not trottle down, so, i ended up taking it in manual mode without flash. Having used a manual SLR camera before, I chose to ues the manual mode when taking indoor shots, giving me the freedom of deciding how i would like the photo to turn out( if you find that indoor shots turn out blur, do increase the ISO speed in manual). One thing i felt was missing was the apature mode. Red eye was not really a problem for me(it has yet to turn up in any of my shots). Playing the pictures back on the television is not a problem as long as you have a cd-rw drive. You can burn it as a VCD using the provided video editing software. It performs very well as a point and shoot camera but, I would recommend at least a 128 mb card.","I got this IXUS V3(powershot s230 ELPH)just 2 nights ago and has taken close to 150 shots.

If you just want to take some special pics anywhere, this is it.  Ease of use (but also some very advanced features for a more advanced photographer) and highly compact make this the camera that anyone can use and the photo quality is better than anything in this price range.  At 3.2 MP, you don't need a huge zoom as you just crop what you want later.  Just get it, you won't be disappointed...","This is my third digital camera; I bought this because I wanted an ultra-portable, 3-megapixel camera. So far it's proving to be what I want -- high quality snapshots in a very small package.<br />Likes:<br />- It's truly small; very easy to carry in pocket, coat, briefcase or purse.<br />- Durable steel case<br />- Very easy to use<br />- Very good image quality.<br />- I am very happy with battery life. I do not agree w/folks challenging battery life on this -- I've used it liberally for a whole day of wandering around on vacation, taking photos, looking at images...more than 60 photos in a day. I have bought extra batteries for my other cameras but really haven't felt the need for this. (For me, having a big memory card and extra batteries makes a digital camera much more convenient for heavy picture taking dealing with a film camera and extra film).<br />Dislikes:<br />- Lots of red eye in indoor flash situations<br />- Some difficulty w/autofocus in low-light situations<br />- Relatively limited zoom (however, I don't think moving to the 330 with the 3x zoom is worth the tradeoff in size).<br />Recommendations:<br />- Buy a case. You'll want to carry this everywhere and a little case protects it from scratches and impacts.<br />- Buy at least 128MB memory card (256 even better if you don't want to worry about using up memory on a longer trip)<br />- Having experimented w/lots of digital photo editing software, I like using ofoto.com's software to pull photos off the camera, quickly look at snaps and upload photos online to share. It's very easy for the basics (crop a snapshot, zap out the redeye, upload some photos for sharing or printing 4 * 6's). For more serious editing, I use Adobe Photoshop Elements 2. The Ofoto.com software is free for the downloading off Ofoto's website; the Elements 2 software is reasonable if you take lots of photos and want to learn how to get the most from your photos. I find that Canon's software is too cumbersome for simple tasks and not flexible enough for heavier duty; Ofoto and Elements make a nice combination for me.<br />- If you're really just using this for casual snapshots, consider the Canon s200 for a significant savings. If you aren't going to blow up your photos the S200 would be fine for most simple shots. The 230 is great but may be overkill if you just want a fun, portable camera.","I already own a 2 megapixel digital camera and I enjoy using it. Unfortunately it is not pocket size so I tend to leave it home if I'm on a long or vigorous outing.  When I read about the Canon PowerShot S230 I hoped the extra megapixels and the smaller size would make it worth the higher price.  This camera easily fits into a small pocket.  The clarity of the photos is great even for an inexperienced photographer like me.  The instructions for set up were concise and easy to follow.  After charging the battery for a couple of hours it took about five minutes to get started.  I took a batch of pictures and printed them directly from the compact flash card- simple, and great quality!  Then I tried the video mode.  On my old camera I had to go into the menu to turn on the video.  By the time I set it up the moment was gone.  With this camera I just flicked the switch, pressed a button and took great video clips (with sound).  The video was also far smoother than with my previous camera.  I can't comment on battery usage because I haven't had it that long but to be prepared I've already charged up an extra battery.  I also recommend at least one extra CF card in case you're not able to download immediately.  Yes, these cost more at the beginning but they can be used again and again.  In short this camera is very small, easy to use and takes great still pictures and video clips.","I love this camera.  It's small, durable, and takes very sharp pictures with little to no effort on the user's part.  There are better camera's out there, but for the money, ease of use, toughness, and size, this one has treated me very well...","If you've read the other reviews, you know the technical merits of this camera.  If you want a camera that you will always have in your pocket with easy to use controls, this is it.  I take it everywhere and get photos that I would never have \"planned\" to take; all without looking like a photographer for National Geographic.<br />As a former Windows user, I love the simplicity of getting photos from the camera to my iMac (with OSX.)  You have to initially set the camera communication setting to PTP, but after that - plug it in, turn it on and let iPhoto do the rest.  No software or drivers to load.","As much as I like the camera, it's terrible PC driver makes it almost worthless. Contrary to the Amazon.com's product description, the camera does not support \"USB storage-class connectivity\".

This is the best I've ever owned.<br />Goods:<br />1) The smallest camera/performance you can get. Period.<br />2) Camera is beautifully designed.<br />3) Software is not that bad.<br />4) Works with XP without software.<br />5) LCD screen is clear and useful.<br />6) Time between pictures is unimaginably short.<br />7) CF cards are cheap cheap cheap.<br />8) Fits in any pocket.<br />The Bad:<br />1) Battery is \"so-so\"<br />2) My nose keeps smudging the LCD screen!<br />3) I'm getting blurry pictures sometimes. (From lack of experience?)<br />4) Only 16MB CF Card","This camera is awesome. I am glad i spent the extra money to get a pocket sized high megapixel camera. I can now take this with me everywhere. It has the convenience of the size of a disposable camera with all the benefits of a digital camera. It is VERY easy to use in every sense of the word. The buttons are not too small and are very easy to manipulate. Hooking it up to my pc (alas i wish i had a mac though) was incredidbly simple. I would recommend upgrading to a higher memory chip however (i bought a 256 compact flash card so i dont have to download everytime i use it). Also i would recommend buying an additional battery so you dont \"die\" in the middle of a party.","I've been waiting a long time for Canon to come out with a 3+ megapixel version of their Elph line of cameras and I wasn't disappointed when I recently purchased the S230.<br />I've always considered 3 megapixels to be the minimum required for photo quality 4x6 prints so when I came time to upgrade from my Kodak DC280, I went with the Olympus C-3000 over the 2 megapixel S110 despite the fact that I found the Canon's small size very appealing.<br />Now that the S230 has finally arrived, I can say that I am very happy with my purchase. The picture quality is not quite as good (a bit more 'noise' is noticeable in night shots) as my Olympus but still much better than my old Kodak DC280.<br />Just as a note to those who can wait: Minolta will soon be releasing the Minolta DiMAGE Xi 3 megapixel version of their popular DiMAGE X camera. This camera is thinner and features a 3x optical zoom as opposed to the 2x zoom on the S230. If it's priced competitively, it might be worth a look. Although for me, it didn't matter; this camera is small enough for me to carry around in my pocket...anything smaller really wasn't necessary and I really didn't want to wait with the holidays coming up."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S45","amazon_reviews":["Built like a tank!

Normally when we depress the button to take a picture we tend to shake the camera a bit. using the timer will minimize that. i hope this works for you","Its a good deal for that price but I have some difficulty in taking night shots. Basically, what ever picture I take in the night shot, they will be blurred. Anyone has got any idea to rectify or improve the condition for the same.","After 6 months of pretty heavy use, I'm very pleased with this camera. The image quality is superb for a consumer digicam. Many think the S45's image quality surpasses that of the (5-megapixel) S50, and I agree. The S50 suffers from higher image noise, and the extra megapixel doesn't really make a big difference in resolution (2592x1944 versus the S45's 2272x1704).<br /><br />Don't expect DSLR quality, however. Be realistic. All consumer point & shoot digicams utilize very small sensors, so image noise will always be an issue at higher sensitivities (above ISO 100).","I've had this camera for over a year now. I bought it intending to keep it as my #1 active camera for several years, and I'm very happy with it. I paid a lot of it, as I got it as soon as it was available, but I have no regrets going the extra mile. Very very nice image quality, good manual controls, and very sturdy. I have dropped this thing on paved bricks and it survived (albeit with a couple of dents). I have fallen into love with digital photography thanks to this camera.<br />The only minor gripes of mine are: It's a little heavy. Does not have a few features such as flash hotshoe... (look into the G3 or G5 for that). The included Canon ZoomBrowser software is bulky and fairly crappy and you only get USB 1.1 transfer speeds (I'd prefer using a plain CF card reader). Optical zoom is modest (but then what do you expect from this lens.) Video mode is limited to 3 mins regardless of how big your CompactFlash card is.<br />As for Canon themselves - my manager at work got himself a S50 after my recommendation, and my brother also got a S50 afterwards. Two of my friends also own IXUS400s... from what I've seen, Canon are definitely one of the best digital cameras makers.","I spent weeks looking for the right digital camera to replace my old Canon digital camera. I finally settled on the Canon S45 due to it's features, quality and the deal I was able to get.<br />So far I am very pleased with the camera and the quality of the photos. I recently took the camera with me out of state to visit family and upon returning I plugged the usb cable into my Apple powerbook and loaded the pictures into iphoto. All the pictures came out very well, only needed to enhance the image on a few photos. All the photos I took were through the automatic setting. I'm sure once I'm comfortable with the manual controls the picture quality will be even better.<br />I was worried about my choice after reading some of the reviews online about the lens cover that is also used to turn the camera on/off. To my relief this turned out to not be a issue at all. Some reviewers stated that the cover was cheap and came off easily. Not sure what they mean as my S45 lens cover seems very sturdy at this point.<br />I almost went with the S400 due to it's size and features but after seeing one in person it just felt too small to me. Although heavier, the S45 size does feel nice and doesn't seem to be an issue as far as carrying around in a small case.","The Canon PowerShot S45 was a terrific small digital camera when it was introduced, but the digital camera market advances quickly and this model has been surpassed by Canon's own S50 (5 megapixel in the same body only in high-tech black).  Serious photographers seekng a digital would turn to Canon's EOS Digital Rebel.  This is a good camera if you want lots of features in a small package without paying a lot of money.<br />Features begin with the generous maximum 4 megapixel image size (you can make them smaller to conserve space on the CompactFlash card).  Several modes are available to you such as Sports (high shutter-speed and high resolution shots), Portrait, Night, etc. You can put it in complete Idiot Mode (okay, Automatic mode) and let it select your shutter speed and aperture, or you can pick one or the other and let the camera pick the missing one, or you can go full into Manual mode and pick both. There's even a Movie mode, complete with sound (although the product info above suggests this is new to the S45, this was available on its precursors the S30 and S40).  These video clips are 320 x 200 pixels.<br />This small camera fits in a purse or shirt pocket easily and won't get in the way if you're shouldering it in a case (not included).  But you pay a price for the small size: the optical zoom is limited to 3x. And unfortuately, the S50, like all the PowerShot S family, starts out at a focal length of 11mm, which is a very wide-angle view. Even at 3X optical zoom you will only come in to 55mm, often not as close as you'd need. There is a digital zoom, but so what? Crop your picture in software later rather than play with that silly feature. But getting back to the range, I found it insufficient for shooting across a large room. If you work closer in this won't be a problem, but 55mm is not a good focal length for shooting children, who stop what they're doing when they notice you right next to them.<br />The sliding door that covers the lens (and turns on the camera) seems flimsy and can cause problems. My 3YO niece got ahold of my S40's (exact same body as the S45) and ripped the door off. I was able to reattach it but now it's a loose tooth, waiting to fall off again. Even under warranty, my choice was to send it back to Canon for 12 weeks or live with it. I couldn't live without the camera, so I kept it, loose sliding door and all. I've just learned not to lend it to people who can't baby it; a good push and that door is off the camera again.<br />One of the S45's limitations is a slow shutter response. I can't tell you how many shots I've missed using it; I frame it lovingly, I see the perfect moment, I shoot... but no score. The people have moved on, the sun has set, the universe suffers heat-death, and finally the shutter clicks. If you want a fast shutter then you must have a digital SLR, as almost all the compact-style digital cameras such as this one have the delayed shutter issue. Another note of annoyance on the PowerShot S family: they come with a wrist strap but no shoulder strap. I don't know what use a wrist strip is for a camera; if I'm not using it then I want my hands free. I bought a generic shoulder strap but it wasn't a great fit. At least Canon should offer one as an extra-cost accessory.<br />I still give this camera 4 stars for putting so many features in such a small package. The pictures are reasonably good, and at this size you can crop plenty out and still print good 4x6 inch images. The PowerShot S45 comes with software, but you'll probably want to buy your own image editing package, such as Photoshop Elements. The one provided is fairly limited. Useful software includes PhotoStitch, which allows you to make your own panaramic style images from a series of linked shots. The included 32 MB CompactFlash card is also too small for typical use, so plan on buying a bigger card.  Also plan on buying a second battery.","First of all, I think too many people shopping for digital cameras get obsessed with megapixels and forget what really make the pictures look good. What is important when buying a digital camera is the lens, and the CCD (charge-coupled device) that detects the light. This is particularly important since almost all digital cameras don't do well in low light conditions, including this one. The are lots of chips inside that determine how the picture will look that you can't compare with other cameras unless you use the other cameras. For more information on how digital cameras work go to [...]<br />I have used this camera extensively, mostly in auto mode where I made little adjustments, and I have noticed that the indoor pictures and outdoor night shots are mediocre if not poor. This is especially apparently when compared with the Sony DSC P10, which I also own. The Canon S45 outdoor pics are spectacular, but I am truely disappointed with the indoor shots. In fact, the Sony P10 is a 5 megapixel and it is smaller and lighter. In addition, you have to slide a cover open to turn on the camera, and eventually the cover gets loose after frequent use and just sort of slides open on its own.<br />Also for some reason, this camera gets a little bit too warm after using it for extended periods of time, I don't know why.<br />I also think it's awkward how the play back button is more of a sliding button you hold down instead of on the dial, I think it is a bit more intutive on the Sony. Canon may have a great history of making good lenses, but the electronics in the Sony outdo this Canon.<br />Overall, the Sony takes better indoor pictures, is smaller, lighter, 5 megapixel and cheaper. This isn't a bad camera, it's just the Sony outdoes it in almost every way.","I recently purchased this camera after having previously owned a Fuji Finepix 2600. After owning the 2600 for just over a year the lens mechanism got stuck and the camera completely broke. It had a 1 year warranty which had just expired, and there's no use paying to fix it. I figured it was time to upgrade, so I spent hours and hours searching CNET and other review sites for 4MP digital cameras and I finally found this one. I would have gone with the Nikon Coolpix 4300, except Canon had their Digic chip which was supposed to allow the camera to go from shot-to-shot faster. Also I own an old Canon SLR camera, and I trusted the brand. This camera is a very good transition from my SLR, much better than my old Fuji. I wanted something with image quality close to that of my film SLR, without the bulkiness or price of a digital SLR. So far this camera has done that, producing some wonderful shots. It has plenty of features ranging from customizable shutter speeds and lens aperture to exposure compensation and 12 scene modes, making it great for shooting in any condition. One of the great features is the AF lamp, a brief light that goes off before the picture is taken that helps focus the image. It works great for low light shots. Another astounding feature is the ability to set ISO speed, just like you would on a film camera. My last camera was almost the same price as this one and has none of these features. I guess that shows how much prices have come down in the past year. There are not many cons about this camera. It's smaller than most cameras with the same amount of megapixels, but it's still not as lightweight as some of the Casio models or Canon's digital Elph. The pictures on ISO 200+ have significant noise, even with noise reduction, and the optical zoom could be larger, and the macro is sub-par, but that's really all that is bad about this camera. Battery life is great, although it uses a proprietary lithium battery. Here is a list of pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Digic image processor.<br />- Large array of features.<br />- Great quality photos.<br />- Panorama stitch mode.<br />- Great battery life.<br />- Movie mode with sound.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- ISO 200+ has significant noise.<br />- Poor macro mode.<br />- Lithium battery instead of AA.<br />- Optical zoom could be larger.<br /><br />Overall this is a great camera and many other reviewers agree with me. It's not too expensive but has features of cameras almost twice as expensive. If you're a beginner photographer you might want to stick to something simpler, as the features are more than you need you, but if you're looking to move up from an old digital camera I guarantee this is the best deal you're going to find.","For the price of this bulky camera, you could get a much smaller 5 megapixel Sony camera. Not only is it bulky, but it is heavy, and far too awkward to fit into a pocket. As far as the image quality goes, the outdoor pictures are beautiful as I had high expectations for this camera, BUT the indoor pictures were mediocre and somewhat unsatisfactory. The pictures I took in decently well-lit conditions didn't even match my 4 year old Kodak DC240. I used the Canon S45 at a birthday party and the faces of the people were often dark, slightly fuzzy, and not clear. With the old kodak the faces of the people were still bright even outdoors at night. That is why I am so disappointed with the Canon, because under low level light conditions, it doesn't even perform better than a 4 year old Kodak digital camera. Also, I found the controls less intuitive than on Sony and Kodak cameras. Overall, a big disappointment when indoors.","(...)

I used the Canon S45 at a birthday party and the faces of the people were often dark, slightly fuzzy, and not clear. (...) That is why I am so disappointed with the Canon, because under low level light conditions, it doesn't even perform better than a (...) Overall, a big disappointment when indoors.","I bought this a few weeks ago. It is a very good machine in terms of creativity it offers. It has 8 preset modes (auto, portrait, landscape, night, fast shutter, slow shutter, stitching and movie) and 5 others...<br />The thing with this camera is: bad flash and a bit weight. May be that is my stupidity but I can get no good pictures with the flash. So if you plan to take photo in the middle of the night with the auto feature (one touch shot), think again. But if you plan to spend some time photographing without the flash (which requires most of the time finding something to place the camera on), then buy it (no garantee though :).<br />And, buy a carrying case along with this camera, there is not one in the kit.","A friend and I bought this for a trip to New Mexico and Arizona, a great decision. The painted desert. The Grand Canyon. What better place to try out a camera? And we certainly tried it out. We took hundreds of pictures and were very happy with the results. We couldn't get over how good the pictures looked and how easy the camera was to operate. I thought it would be neat,digital pictures, but as a long devotee to film, I didn't take them very seriously. I do now. The camera well designed and the pictures quite often are just what you'd hoped for--a rare thing with my old 35mms SLRs. The camera might have paid for itself just in film and developing costs on that one trip. And the printouts look good and you can also easily email them, which we did from the road and was much fun. I would recommend highly using a laptop on a trip, since we filled up the 128 MB card (bought separately and also highly recommended) almost every day and then emptied the card onto the computer in order to have a fresh 128mb for the next day. I've just bought a new Apple laptop and one of the deciding things was portability and storage for the next trip with the camera. One of the best things I've ever bought. A superb piece of equipment. I've seen the future of pictures and it's digital.","All my life, I've used cameras that require film. Two weeks ago, my wife and I acquired our first digital, the POWERSHOT S45, and last week gave it an initial workout at Bryce, Zion, and Grand Canyon national parks. This review is by no means exhaustive as I've yet to master all of the camera's features; it's a summary of relatively superficial first impressions.<br />The bottom line is that this 4 megapixel device takes impressively good pictures of such high detail resolution that my wife, a graphic designer, expects to use its output in PhotoShop for her professional work. It's small enough to be easily held in one hand, and is so light as to be barely  noticeable when carried in a small padded bag hung around the neck. (The old 35 mm was a millstone in comparison.) The silvery finish is smudge resistant, as when handled with fingers made greasy with french fries.<br />You may wish to purchase an extra rechargeable lithium battery. After neglecting to re-energize it overnight after taking some ten snaps, the battery pooped out the next day (in the middle of our Bryce exploration) after taking an additional fifty-eight shots. Of course, being new to the digital experience, we were using up a lot of power constantly reviewing our photo masterpieces on the LCD screen. In any case, the power cell recharges surprisingly quickly. Also, we thought it prudent to purchase the larger 256 MB CompactFlash card (for in-camera image storage) to replace the 32 MB card provided.<br />Speaking of the screen, it's fairly small at1.5 x 1.12 inches, and its display is very difficult to see in bright sunlight. And, if you need glasses to read small print, keep them handy to decipher the system's on-screen icons.<br />While the 3x optical zoom lens is swell as far as it goes, the inability to attach a polarizer filter can be immensely aggravating under certain conditions.<br />The shutter button's surface is smooth and entirely flush with the camera body; I was insecure enough to have to constantly check that my finger was on the button.<br />One of the camera's greatest strong points is its wealth of features. For the digital novice, this versatility is perhaps an initial disadvantage since it'll take effort and time to become knowledgeable and well-practiced in all of them. Indeed, the 181-page user guide is a prodigious read. But, it is, to the extent that I've so far digested it, commendably comprehensive and easy to understand (with a plethora of illustrations).<br />The provided software and transfer cable made uploading of each day's output to our PC laptop completely effortless. (My wife would subsequently transfer the image files to a CD for future manipulation in PhotoShop on her Mac.)<br />My wife takes a lot of pictures that leave me rolling my eyes and shaking my head. Unfortunately, the digital nature of the POWERSHOT S45 leaves me unarmed with the old argument, \"You're wasting film!\" Isn't technology wonderful?","This is an excellent point and shoot camera with many many features.  Shooting is smooth and quick, and review and erase are very easy.  Changing feature are also very simple.  love this camera  If there is a \"con\" is that it is slightly heavy and thick, but it has lots of features.","This is an excellent point and shoot camera with many many features.

Changing feature are also very simple.  love this camera  If there is a \"con\" is that it is slightly heavy and thick, but it has lots of features.","I bought this camera a few months ago. I really like it but I found some drawbacks on this qonderful camera. (It is impossible for me to find a perfect camera)<br />1. Zoom control is not easy to use. Unlike S400, zoom is locked in step. The control is ok but not as good as traditional SLR cameras or S400.<br />2. When you switch to P, A, S, etc mode the 9 points auto focus function is gone. This is not a big deal though if you can use the other auto functions.<br />3. I wish they change the way len is cover by sliding cover. I don't feel very confident that the len is protected by dust.<br />4. Macro is not working very well. I guess it must be the same as most digital camera.<br />  Ok. Most of these complaint (except the first one) I fully expected when I bought. Why the heck I bought this camera?<br />1. Canon digital camera has the best picture quality. About the same as Nikon but cheaper. Far superior than Kodak.<br />2. Compactflash memory is cheaper than other format. Unlike other, high capacity memory card is available.<br />3. More manual control over S400 but not too much as G serie.<br />I think 4MP is more than enough unless you want pictures more than 8X11. Hope this review helps your purchase decision.","of this camera, I bought it for a amatuer photographer, and she said she loved it<br />...","A terrific camera for someone of really want to take great pictures.  A little confusing at first...as are most digitals, but the photos are great.  On my second session, I took a picture worthy of a magazine!","I bought this camera right after it came out. It was recommended to me by my dealer, because I was looking for a digital camera with at least 4 mega pixels, that I could use on land and underwater, in a [certain]price range ...<br />This camera has fulfilled all those requirements beautifully. Things I like about the camera: it's compact, easy to use, has a lot of features that you don't even need to know in the beginning to get started. I started taking pictures right away by setting it to Auto. But as you want to learn more, the camera can do more. It's very easy to use underwater. You turn it on, set it so that the it will power down after a minute of disuse, turn off the display to conserve the battery, pop it into its housing, run some silicon around the o-ring, and off you go. On a recent dive trip, I was able to take photos for two dives on a single battery. Then I'd go back to my room for a bit of rest, change the battery, put some more silicon onj the seal and close it up again. I couldn't believe how easy it was. At the end of the day, I'd go through my shots and delete the ones I didn't like. You can also zoom in on your photos in the display mode to take a close up look without having to hook your camera up to a computer.<br />On land, I recently hooked the camera up to my tripod and took a family portrait with the timer setting.<br />It takes action shots, low light shots, panoramic shots (through stitching), hi resolution shots, low resolutions shots, you name it, this camera does it.","This camera does not disappoint -- well, unless you were hoping the features were easy to figure out and use.  The camera is awesome and takes excellent quality shots just using the \"automatic\" setting.  (2 months later I am still stuck on the automatic setting!)  The manual, however, is the size of Madagascar, and requires an afternoon (or weekend?) of committment to get through it.  I am sure this camera has many excellent features and their discovery should provide months of entertainment!!","I wanted a small compact camera with high resolution and compact flash media II compatible which can fit in your pocket. The S45 was the choice for me. If you used a Canon SLR you will see similar shooting modes on the S45, such as Aperture Priorty, Shutter Priority, and Programmed mode. The shutter speeds ranges from 1/4000 to 15 seconds and the aperture range is from f2.8/4.9 to f8. This will give you some exposure range to experiment with, just like an SLR.<br />The image quality is good with 4mega-pixels. It will never match the high quality image of a SLR Lens and SLR Digital camera, but this is the compromise for all compact cameras.<br />The battery life is good but I usually only take about 50 photos per day when on holiday. At the hotel I just recharge it for the next day. I'm using a 340gb microdrive and it can store about 150 high resolution photos. If you get this camera or any compact flash II camera get the 1gb microdrive, they are inexpensive and you can store some 400 photos at the max resoltuion for this camera. Another reason to get the 1gb microdrive is you can copy your favorite photos from your pc to the camera, then when you visit your friends/relatives you can watch then on a big tv.<br />The video mode on the S45 is simple. During recording its only a 320x240. On TV its like an MPEG1 movie and quailty is very poor, really unwatchable. On the PC it looks fine but the screen is small. Also during video mode you cannot use the zoom lens so forget close ups during recording, unless you are physically moving closer.<br />In this camera there is an automatic red eye flash reduction. Unforutnately I'm one of those people who will close their eyes during the pre flash so most of my flash photos of myself are with my eyes closed or squinted. I wish they would just allow regular flash like on the S20.<br />There is a flash exposure control so you can either under/over expose the flash. I will usually under expose the flash when taking a portrait in sunlight to reduce the shadow.<br />All in all this camera and the future Canon S series has SLR features to play with, if you chose, but still can fit in your pocket.","This camera is great for people who want to be  able to take easy photos in auto mode, but would like to be able to manually chage the aperature.  I got excellent results with this camera. I love it!","I think this camera is fabulous, but there are a few things I wish Canon can address in the near future.<br />1) The smallest size the pictures come is in 640 x 480.  I'm hoping to save the image in a smaller size, something that would fit the standard photopaper size.  That way I don't have to adjust the size of the image in order for it to print correctly on the standard photo papers.<br />2) Battery life is a bit short.  I was taking pictures for my brother's graduation, and the battery died at the most critical moment of the ceremony.  Luckily, I got a spare.  Make sure to get some extra battery, you'll need it.<br />3) The \"Set\" button is sometime tricky.  One time when I want to view how much memory I have left on the compact card, instead, I accidently formatted all the pictures on the card.  Everything happened in less than 2 seconds.  I was so very upset and because the camera has some very memorable pictures I haven't had the chance to save it yet.  And unfortunately, the camera doesn't have an undelete or unformat function.  Luckily, I was able to find a data recovery program and recover all the images.<br />Othere than that, the camera is a superb product.","Been using the S45 for 3 months now. Great picture quality and relatively easy to get started and use. A bit heavier than I would like and I hate the lens cover. Should have a regular on and off switch and a more reliable lens cover. I haven't used the software that comes with the camera. Just using a card reader with XP and a graphics program I was already using. Overall I am happy with the camera.","I purchased the canon after a long period of lamenting over the cost and the features of this camera versus a G2, or another brand (Fuji, Olympus).<br />After owning this camera for ~6months I am relatively happy with it.  I picked the S40 over the G2 based on power off to shoot time and abitlity to stuff it in my pocket in a hurry to switch from camera to DV.  The G2 took ~2 seconds longer to power up than the S40, and it is also quite a bit bigger.  The CCD is the same, and I needed the point-and-shoot feaures also so the S40 was the winner.<br />Picture quality is superb, but you have to know how to shoot a good picture to begin with.  The response time to capture an image is great if the AiAE is set to center weight and not evaluative.  This helps to keep the desired target in focus and reduces autofocus times tremendously.<br />The .avi clips are good quality so its a nice feature, but I wouldn't use it as a video camera, more for action type shots that you don't want to miss...","I bought this camera on Christmas Eve and by Christmas, had mastered the auto mode and was taking some great pictures! This camera is wonderful!  It is not too large nor too heavy (like the G series) but still has most of the capabilities of that series.  For those amongst us who just want some decent pictures - this camera is for you!  It has many bells and whistles if you choose to expand beyond the pointing and shooting. With a simple flash card reader, it is incredibly simple to download the pictures onto your computer.  With 4MP, enlargements including 8x10 are as crisp as a professionals. I have only owned Canon cameras prior to this (the Sure Shot) so did not do any comparison shopping - this camera is the best!","I've had my Canon S45 for about three months now, and I am still discovering new features that make it even more endearing.<br />The picture quality is excellent under almost any conditions.  The 4.1 megapixels are more than sufficient, in fact, I often dial down the resolution to save file space.  The movie clips with sound are much better than I expected.  The sturdy silver case with the clamshell cover is my favorite feature.  It fits easily in my pocket, and is easy and quick to open for that first shot.  The software was simple to install and use, and the instruction manuals (almost as thick as the camera) were nicely done.  I ordered a 128mb card with the camera, which holds an amazing quantity of photos and film clips - highly recommended.<br />There are only a few minor complaints.  The viewfinder is very plain and doesn't display the digital zooming effect, so you are very dependent on the LCD screen.  The screen is nearly impossible to see in direct sunlight, and the data is very tiny.  Also, the low battery indicator doesn't seem to appear until there is only power for one or two more photos.  Red eye can be a problem, although coaching the photographed people to look at the pre-flash srobe, as the directions explained, does work well.  And some photos containing horizontal lines can have a jagged appearance at some resolutions, but it is usually minimal.  But I have adjusted to these little problems and don't consider them reason enough to not recommend this little marvel of technology to anyone!","Have had the S45 for a few weeks now.  The pictures are great, the features are top notch, and the size and weight are within my portability limits (just).  The sliding lens cover comes out of its track so I have to hold it down while sliding to get it closed properly. Also, the LCD screen scratches too easily and I worry about the long-term viewability after some solid use.<br />Battery life seems great, and once you've read the manual the menu-based controls are fairly easy.  Movie mode is very cool.","I had decided to buy the S40 but when this things came out, I just decided to go with this as it is definetely better than S40. More to say much better than sony equivalent. Why pay more for sony when u can get much better & great  camera as this one.","This camera is highly rated across the board everywhere I look.  It's got almost all the features and capabilities of it's larger sibling, the G3, but in a smaller, more compact, and easier to use package.<br />The output is really good with excellent color and good definition unless you zoom in way too far.  The feature set is quite complete and there are plenty of choices between expert and novice modes.  It's a well made device.  It's also cheaper than the S50 (5 megapixel) which is fine as the 4 megapixel count is adequate for 90% of the population who would buy this camera.<br />My only complaints are that the low light focus capability is poor.  While better than the S40/30 it's still not able to quite focus on its own in a darkened room even WITH the focus assist light.  Some manual focusing is necessary which is also imprecise and a chore.  Also the aperture is a bit slow at telephoto settings which also worsens the focus and severely affects the blurriness of the captured image if you move too much when snapping the picture.<br />Other than these problems, it would have received five stars.","pros: The pictures are very sharp and operation of the camera is cool. Software is also good, especially the PhotoStich utility, works without any problems on my Win 98.<br />Cons: Need to handle the lens cover with care, looks sturdy though. The multicontroller is a bit of a pain sometimes, mine has a slight problem when erasing images.","The Canon S45 is an excellent digital camera with a few drawbacks.  As far as 4MP cameras go, it is a bit pricey but the quality of the camera build and the features on the camera make it well worth the price.  While the camera isn't exactly shirt pocketable, it is still fairly easy to carry around with you and not overly bulky.<br />On the plus side, the S45 has:<br />1) 9 point AutoFocus<br />2) DIGIC processor which speeds up capture of photos and their quality<br />3) 3x Optical Zoom (who cares about the digital zoom)<br />4) 4 MP picture quality<br />5) Easy to use interface with quick access to manual settings via FUNC button<br />6) close to centered tripod attachment for easier stitch photo taking<br />7) A ton of manual settings (exposure settings, aperture settings, shutter settings, white balance, photo effects, and more!)  Almost all the settings available on Canon's high end G3 camera!<br />8) A pretty tough metal body<br />9) Ability of the camera to take RAW shots for photoediting.<br />On the minus side:<br />1) Decent to weak flash that is better than the S400 but still weak for low light and night photos at greater than 10 feet away.<br />2) Decent to below average battery life... 200 shots on a full charge with LCD on in my experience<br />3) Slide door that protects lens and doubles as power switch worries me in quality a bit.<br />4) Red eye problems with straight flash use but much less so when the red eye reduction is used.<br />5) I wish it had a hot shoe or some other way to add an external flash unit.<br />The camera takes fantastic shots even when in manual mode although its strengths will be found when you learn the manual settings of the camera.  I think this is a better buy than the Canon S400 since they are the same price.  If you're willing to sacrifice a little size... this Canon won't disappoint!","After extensive research, I decided on this camera as a replacement for my older 2 megapixel Olympus 2040.  I have been very impressed with it so far - it seems very well built (sturdy), is small enough to fit in my coat pocket, and takes great pictures.  The telescoping lens extends and retracts very quickly making it easy to take a picture on a moment's notice - this was a problem with my old camera - it was too slow.<br />When researching the camera, I was trying to find one that took \"AA\" batteries since they are much cheaper (NiMH).  However, the Canon NB-2L battery isn't too expensive if purchased from a third party retailer (I got a generic one for [$$]).  Also, the included charger is very small and portable with built in retractable AC plug - it's lightweight and easy to throw in a bag and take with you.<br />The camera records the orientation that each photo is shot with in the EXIF header, and if you use the bundled Canon software to download the photos, it auto-rotates them for you.  This is very handy.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work if you use other software such as iPhoto or Image Capture.<br />The mode dial is very handy - it has enough settings on it (ie, automatic, manual, shutter priority, aperture priority, night shot, portrait, movie mode, etc.) that you can quickly flip to the one you want.  My old camera required the use of menu systems to set most of these modes - the dial is much faster.<br />The camera features a stitch mode which allows you to stitch together multiple pictures to form a panorama.  When in this mode, the camera shows you the last picture you took (offset to the side) allowing you to roughly overlap 1/3 of the next picture with the previous one.  Using the included stitch software, I was able to easily make a Quicktime VR movie - pretty cool.  You can also make panoramas with this mode, and unlike some manufacturers (Olympus), this works with any brand of CF card, it doesn't have to be the manufacturer supplied one.<br />The only drawback I've found for this camera is the lack of a USB auto-mounter feature (\"Mass Storage Device\") which many other cameras have.  This feature allows you to just plug in the USB cable to your computer and have the camera auto-mount on your desktop like any other removable disk.  I wish Canon would include this feature since it enables you to completely bypass software for the import process.  This is something I can live without though - the other features make up for it.<br />Overall, a great camera which I would highly recommend!","What i like about this camera:<br />1) fast buffer (there aren't much waiting for the last picture to be saved before shooting another one, kodak's camera made me wait up to 13 seconds a few time!) this one is within 5 second if the picture quality is high. When it come to taking 10-16 rapid fire shots, there aren't much waiting in saving the file too!<br />2) Features, features...so many. You got photo stitch, a great way to make a 360 picture just about anywhere.<br />3) manual controls, flash control (most digital cameras dont have flash control...but what if flash is too bright for some areas? what you going to do? , canon solves all of these !)<br />4) fast zoom optical lense retract, 1.8 second before first shot taken... beats minolta f100, 6 second! you'll miss a shot before you know it.<br />5) movie mode, up to 3 minutes (which is a lot!) great sound very clear, video quality is good, better than others i have seen.<br />6) customize sound start up screen! (put whatever you want as sounds, it even got themes you can upload from the cd software that is included....tons of stuff to play with.<br />7) replay control... browsing through tons of photos that<br /> just got taken? no problem, easy navigational system! love it, you got to check it out.<br />8) solid metal case, nice nice nice but do becareful as well<br />9) zoom optical lense is in the center rather than on the far left side like minolta f100 and sony's digital cameras. This way you wont get your fingers in the way too easily, and plus if you let someone else use your camera , it's better to know that they won't accidently mess up the lense~!<br />10) softwares provided is great, fun to play around with, cool graphics too to try.<br />11) compact flash memory,....... up to 1 gig mircodrive.but honestly you only need 256, = 200 high resolution photos.!<br />12) small, but not too pocket-sized. Surprisingly easy to handle and comfortable. Still i say is smaller than most digital cameras I have seen.<br />things I wish they had done better<br />1) the lense cover, you slide it open to turn on, slide it back to turn off.. have to be careful about this thing. very fragile cover. I wish they used a on off button instead.<br />2) battery is not AA. You have to use their charger + battery, .... ... But i wish it was AA because I have AA charger already. I have to buy spare, which is \"costly\"","After over a month experimenting with most of the function/settings, have to admit I'm pretty impressed on both built/picture quality of the Canon newly improved S45. Even at auto mode you can hardly produce a bad shot, provided that I'm a die-hard manual SLR fan of NIKO FM2 for nearly twenty yrs.<br />Rarely need to use photoshop to polish/adjust pics taken by S45, unlike my previous digital camera which I have to spend lots of time to correct digital noise, redeyes..etc.<br />When shopping for digital camera, don't get too obsessed with megapixels or spec. 'number', what's more important are the software/chips which make the camera provide precise light sensing & focus accuracy as well as flexible tweaks when you want your pics to have optimum result at any given changing shooting environment. This point is well taken by users of Sharp's 4mp digital camera which uses Canon G2 equivalent lens but produces far inferior pics than Canon's even though Sharp's camera cost 40% less (so is the quality...).<br />For S45, a large capacity CF card & a spare battery is always a must if you do indoor flash shooting & prefer to store pics at high resolution(which gives you stunning result), costco's website do provide a package deals that include above mentioned extras at reasonable price.<br />LCD comes with a clear plastic cover that gives you enough protection, or you can buy those LCD protection sheets for PDAs then cut to desired size for less than five bucks. Exterior of S45 is a nice brushed metal finish which provides enough protection for its lens.<br />No comment on the software since I installed the camera's driver only & use photoshop to polish when needed.  Twain driver is quickly recognized by most 3rd party graphic & photo album softwares when hooked up with PC.<br />Upon comapring Canon's G2,G3,S230 & S45, S45 provides the best combination between size/function/pic quality criteria & one can hardly go wrong with any of them.","This is a very nice camera that takes very nice photos. the only reservation i have about it is that the \"set\" button can sometimes be hard to use (the set button is used in menues). The sed button is part of a 5 way button that is hard to operate with gloves on (or for people with poor motor skiils). I would maybe not recomend this to you arctic grandmother, but everyone else should love it.","This is my first digital camera but I consider myself an advanced user because I am a graphic designer who works a lot with SLRs and in Photoshop. I tried out almost every single feature on this camera in the first 5 days I had it. I am very impressed. I am very picky about image quality and resolution, and I would not take shots with anything less than 4 megapixel resolution, because I would notice the pixels in the printouts immediately. In my opinion, this camera does great for prints up to 5 x 7, which is all one usually needs. The movie mode is excellent, and I was able to hook up the camera to my VCR, set it to slide show, and record the images and movies I wanted to videotape. Even on videotape, the movie and sound quality is still quite good, almost like from a regular home video recorder.<br />I am very pleased. Unfortunately after 5 days, I dropped the camera onto a hard tile floor. It continued to function, but soon I found out that the lightmeter was way off, so I had to send it to Canon for costly repair...It needed a new optical unit.<br />Digital cameras are much more fragile than SLRs, but this one is remarkably sturdy. I just can't think of anything bad to say about it.","I have this camera for couple of weeks now and have taken more than 100 pictures. It is an excellent camera, though I have not taken prints yet, but I have seen pictures on TV & computer. Takes excelent movie. Whatever people are saying in the praise are 100% correct. So Why 4 stars??? There are few issues that I have encountered so far, which may not be of any importance to you, but are to me:<br />1. It does not imprint Date on the picture. You can get the date printed on the prints, but that is possible through Canon's ZoomBrowser EX program. which means you need to buy a photo printer also.<br />2. When viewing picture, you can zoom into the picture, but can not take a snapshot of any region. You can do this using any software, but that is an extra headache.<br />I have seen Sony's DSC-P9, and it does both and is also an excellent camera.","I purchased this camera because it has most of the manual features of the Canon G2 & G3 models, but it is much more compact and has a reputation for taking great pictures at the automatic settings. That was a big plus as I'm new to photography as a hobby. I have not been disappointed. In fact, it has exceeded every expectation. Thus far, I have been unable to take a bad picture using the automatic settings! The downside of this (if you can call it a downside) is that it made me a little lazy about learning all the manual adjustments and features to customize a shot!...but I am learning them because this is the greatest, most fascinating little electronic gadget I have ever had! I Haven't had it very long, but so far a very reliable product.<br />If you are like me and hestiant to pursue photography as a hobby because of the potential for wasting film and processing with a traditional camera while learning the craft, this is the ideal digital camera for a novice. For the money, I can't imagine a better product. Very high quality, hefty for its small size but it gives a sense of confidence. Some other cameras feel like toys compared to it. The only reason to avoid this model is that it doesn't have interchangable lenses--but that's the ONLY reason--and you have to get a larger, more expensive model to get that flexibility.","First off, I love the camera.  The only problems I have had are with redeye (easily fixed with included software), and getting the LCD screen scratched just days after I made the purchase. I just wish there were a cover for the LCD.  I went diving with the scuba housing WP-3000 and got some great shots.  This camera was the talk of anybody that saw it...it almost got annoying at times.  I suggest getting a larger card, and an extra battery.","Got this about a week ago and I couldn't be happier! Has more features than I will ever use, but it's nice that they are there. Starting up is a snap.  Haven't printed at all yet, but image quality is great.  Downloading pictures to the computer is also super easy. Highly recommend it to who can afford it.<br />Also bought the Wp-Dc300 waterproof case, that this is great. Can't wait to take it scuba diving (good to 100ft!).  It will also be great for the beach, keeps that sand out. it is expensive but when it arrives you'll see why, the quality is fantastic.<br />I had some trouble find a case that would work with this camera.  Saw lots of complaints in the reviews so I went to Best Buy to fit a couple. I found that the Samsonite 801bk fits really well.  The camera has little room to move, it fits a spare battery, spare CF card easily and the video wire (this makes it kinda tight but still works). The case is rather small so its still easy to carry around.<br />Hope all this helps, Good Luck!","When my Nikon CoolPix died after two years, I decided to go back to the brand that I have had all my life, Canons.  I must say that I am not disappointed.  The choice was between the S45 and the G3, I decided to go with the S45 bacause of its size and I figured I could do without the ND filter on the G3.  The S45 is amazing.  Incredible focusing speed and image capture.  My Nikon would take so long to capture the image that the subject would move, ruining the composition, not so with the S45.  It is truly one of the best digicams on the market.  The images are crisp and true to life and the colors are just brilliant.  What can I say, I am back on the Canon train.","Aloha there<br />Bought this camera before Xmas here in the UK and have found that the camera is working perfect. This is my first digital camemra and I like it. I especially like the video recording that it can do. It's quite good. I have not yet learned all the fuctions of the camera, but so far it's been very good.<br />I have researched for 3 month on digital camera's before I decided it should be this camera. I like the Ixus, but thought that there must be something else, so I used \"consumer website\" to understand what to look for in a digital camera. I also bought a 256 mb CF card from crucial.com.<br />It works perfectly. The only thing I have for this camera is the battery time. Another reason why i bought it was becuase you can dive with it and that is so cool. Imagine Thailand...<br />Anyway, I can recomend it.","Aloha there<br />Bought this camera before Xmas here in the UK and have found that the camera is working perfect.

It is really excellent. Indoor flash doesn't seem to be a problem. Only problem so far is low light focussing in the telephoto mode. It should default to infinity if it can't really see anything. However it doesn't seem to do this. Now I have read the manual - I believe I've sorted this out - MF manual focus needs to be invoked. Will report later.<br />Is wonderful in all other conditions so far. However, none of these compact digitals can rival an SLR - yet!<br />Mar 2003: The focussing problem I discussed above has now been corrected by Canon. See:PowerShot S45 Firmware Update Corrects the incompatibility with certain computers that caused occasional errors in transmitting data from the computer to the camera<br />- Corrects the occasional AF errors when using Active Frame Control / FlexiZone AF.<br />I have tested the upgraded camera and the focussing problem really is fixed! With  v1.0.2.0, this camera is now just about perfect. The \"set\" button is the only remaining problem.  However, you can learn to use that button.","The Canon S45 is basically a revision of the S40 with some newer software included. The S40 is itself a version of the Powershot G3 without the gimmicks like remote control, flash mounting, and a few other tricks. The sensor and optics are the same for all three cameras, the difference is in the software on the camera, the editing software for the PC that comes with it, and the gimmicks.<br />The S45 is a nice camera. The user interface is much better than on the S40, and it still has the excellent color quality and image resolution of a 4MP camera. It is ruggedly designed, has high quality optics and CCD, and numerous buttons that are out of the way for normal use. It has full auto and full manual modes, so it's appropriate for beginners and experienced users.<br />The downside of the camera is the slow startup time. The flash is also in a spot where your finger might cover it if you're not careful. There is some noise at low light levels, but this is true of all CCD cameras, and the S45 is about average in this respect. The images are excellent at high resolution/large file size, but the included 32MB flash card is a joke. Canon should know better, and ship all cameras with at least 256MB cards.<br />The major downside of the package is the photo editing/printing software that comes bundled with the camera. It's user interface is an atrocity, buttons have icons rather than labels, there is no menu tab, etc. The camera is quickly recognized by USB port, and the downloads are quick. Just be sure to get Photoshop or another quality editing software package, rather than relying on the [stuff] that comes bundled with this camera.","Unknowingly my son-in-law and I both bought the same camera a day apart and for the same reasons. This is by far the best camera for the money around. Its flexibility is enormous. Its size is perfect to carry and not be burdened.<br />I love it and will probably never use any thing except \"Auto\" but I still have the oher features is I want. I use a Viking CF card reader to download to photoshop which works perfectly for me. Far and away the best buy around","The adamfblock (from SF) review above was just about perfect.  Everybody likes this camera.  But nobody thinks any camera is perfect, a rating should be given relative to peers, meaning in this case 5 stars.  If you research this camera you will find no strong argument that any camera in its class exceeds the S-45 in quality/features.  The G3 is a better camera, but too big for my purposes.  I would miss all those spontaneous surprise shots if I ony had a G3, because I would not have it with me.  And while size of aternative really tiny cameras is nice, everyone agrees that the loss of features/quality in those is rather significant (at this point). The S-45 is small enough to carry around most everywhere, I got the little leather container that can be worn on your belt like a pocket knife, that is nice.  If you only have one camera, and want to avoid any driving desire to replace it in the next 5 years, this is a good bet.","I recently picked up the S45 in Japan. I own a Nikon Coolpix 2500, which I love for its compact size and rotating lens/flash unit, but wanted a camera with resolution to match my photo printer, a Sony DPP-SV77.<br />My requirements for the new camera were: 4 megapixel, optical finder along with an LCD, 3x optical zoom, and a very compact size (roughly equivalent to the Coolpix).<br />After reviewing the available options, the S45 seemed to be the best fit. Now that I've owned it for a week, I can say definitively that is an outstanding camera, with more features than most users will ever take advantage of.<br />The software in the camera is extremely well thought out. The viewfinder display is clear and comprehensive (but with an option to reduce the complexity by eliminating unnecessary icons), and the various exposure modes are so complete that the S45 easily rivals the new generation of 35mm SLRs in terms of metering and exposure options. This includes aperture- and shutter-priority, the ability to change exposure values instantly even in Program mode, a range of ISO equivalents, EV compensation, and of course a fully manual option.<br />Of course, the digital-only goodies are here as well, including a 15 fps video mode (with sound and *in-camera editing*), a panorama stitching feature that is extremely cool, and voice tagging of the still images.<br />Image quality is excellent, with only a hint of that traditional digital low contrast that seems to be prevalent in all but the ultra high end (6mp) cameras. (Intriguingly however, you can store pictures in RAW [rather than JPEG] mode and change the contrast and brightness in PC software after the fact without quality loss.)<br />My only complaints are minimal: first, I love the fact that my Coolpix shows up as a removable drive directly in Windows Explorer; with the S45 you have to use Canon's included software (which is excellent) to transfer images from the camera. Second, the lens cover (also an on/off switch), while it feels solid, doesn't always close firmly, which makes me worry a bit about its durability. Finally, the camera is somewhat thicker and heavier (denser-feeling) than the Coolpix, which is the trade-off you make for far far more features (at an admittedly higher price).<br />I limited my brand choices to Nikon, Canon, and Sony, and I think that in this form factor there is no camera that even comes close to the S45 (except perhaps the older S40). If you are a sophisticated amateur (or even a pro looking for a backup digicam), you won't be disappointed."]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE 7Hi","amazon_reviews":["I got this camera new back in 2003 and it served me faithfully for 5 years before the camera's compact flash reader konked out.

This Achilles heal of this camera is it's mixed blessing of the use of the very common AA battery: and does this thing eat them! I already had a good supply of AA batteries and that an easy issue to deal with. I miss using this camera and took many memorable shots with it before it gave up the ghost.

I come from a manual-focus film background and this is my first digital. Overall, I am pleased with the results I get from this camera. I like the fact you can manual focus. Also, the ability to use filters such as a polarizer and black and white filters is a bonus. (This is one of my main complaints about  many point and shoots-no filter threads).The ability to shoot RAW and TIFF  files is also an important feature. I've gotten some great Macro shoots with this camera too. The overall image quality seems quite good. There is some noise especially at higher ISO. I am not too impressed with the landscape shots I've taken. Even at f8 it still seems that something is out of focus. The lack of depth of field markings on the lens does not help. You can not use \"Hyperfocal focusing\" techniques. Image quality in my opinion still can not touch film- especially slide film. I find too the autofocus is slow with moving subjects<br /><br />  So far I've had no major problems with this camera. Every now and then it does something weird but I just take the batteries out and reboot and it seems OK.It has many great features on it and, thus, is not for the inexperienced photographer unless you just want to shoot on program all the time and not use the extra features. Overall, a good camera. I would probably not buy one new but if you can pick one up used for a good price then I would recommend it over  a point and shoot style digicams or if you can't afford a digital SLR.","I've had this camera just a little over a year and have made it through learning the modes in the rather large instruction manual and the one problem I have is not-so clear pictures!  It either get a pixelated photo or it just is slightly out of focus!

If you are shopping for a camera go to dpreview first and see what kind of pictures it takes.","You won't be disappointed by the quality photos the 7Hi will take.  If you're still considering buying this camera, consider other options as there are newer models.  Considering there are dozens of reviews on the product itself, here are the weaknesses that I've experienced:<br /><br />- Drains batteries.  The 7Hi uses 4 AA batteries.  If you're going on a trip, plan on bringing 4-8 extra rechargable batteries (at least 1800 mAH) and a battery charger.  One set of batteries should last at least 100 shots (without flash). Do not use regular alkaline batteries as the camera will go through them quickly (Maybe 50 shots).<br /><br />- Does not utilize highspeed CF cards.  I purchased a Lexar 512MB 40x CF Card, and did notice any increase in performance over the one included.<br /><br />- Many digital cameras now have video capabilities.  The 7Hi records videos in quicktime .mov format at a maximum length of 60 seconds.  The videos come out grainy.","I've used a Minolta SRT 201 35 mm SLR since the early 80's and took the plunge with a Nikon Coolpix 2000 when I decided to try out digital photgraphy.  It became obvious that the 2Mp Nikon was rather limiting and I got a Dimage 7Hi last spring.  All of the positive points in the other reviews are accurate.  This is not an entry level camera, and there is a learning curve, but the results are worth it if you use a decent photo editor, and print on high quality paper using a decent printer for your serious work.  I use Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 (will be upgarding to 3.0) and print on a Canon i960.  I still use the Nikon when non-serious photography is appropriate.<br /><br />As for the negatives noted in the reviews, all Minoltas are notorious for draining batteries so at least one spare set of rechargeable high capacity NiMH AA's with a 15-minute battery charger are highly recommended.  Regarding the USB down-loading issues, my PC came equipped with a card reader, so I just insert the CF card into the reader and there are no USB issues as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Eventually, when the technology reaches the 10Mp resolution stage, I'll upgrade for the last time, but until then, the 7Hi does the job very nicely.","I got this camera new back in 2003 and it served me faithfully for 5 years before the camera's compact flash reader konked out.

But I have, and I'm pretty disappointed.<br />What disappointed me:<br />- Wrong subject focused. If you let the camera's artificial intelligence pick the subject to focus for you, you're likely to have to refocus a lot, unless you fix the focusing point.<br />- Impossible action focusing. If the subject is moving, you can forget about getting it in focus in the continuous focus mode. You'd have to prefocus.<br />- Slow focusing. Even slower than some compacts.<br />- Power hungry. Make sure you get spare batteries. I have a feeling that most of the power goes to heating the CF card, since the card gets pretty hot when reading/writing.<br />What kept me from trashing it:<br />- Picture quality is pretty good.<br />- Adobe RGB colorspace can be useful (if you use it).<br />- Good lens range (28mm-200mm equiv.), with decent quality throughout.<br />- Pretty good macro performance.<br />- Manual zoom, but this is subjective.<br />- Comfortable to handle, though slightly small.<br />- Useful view modes, like grid or crosshair.<br />- Useful manually controlled focusing point.<br />- Allows screw-on filters.<br />So should you buy one? I'd say that if you do any form of action photography, be it sports or just cute kids running around, look elsewhere. But if you like landscapes, architecture, still life, portraits, etc. where the subject doesn't move around, this might be for you.","After reading so many \"pros\" I must add some \"cons\":<br />1 - Service - I bought my brand new camera on July 2003 used it fo 3 months and then it stoped functining - showing the \"error\" sign.<br />I droped it to the Minolta representative in Israel 3.5 months ago, and have not received it back yet.<br />Minolta Japan did not reply my e-mail.<br />2 - You have to carry atleast 2 sets of extra batarries, because it \"eats\" them more than any other camera I have used.<br />3 - When you compare the size in megabites of this camera's photos  with similar pixle photo made by another make - you may find that this camera use almost double amount of m.b. to create the same photo.","I am finally getting the pictures that I always wanted to take. I have been shooting 35mm SLR's for 20 years and I may never go back. I picked this camera up used 2 weeks ago and have just printed my second set of prints through a good camera shop. For the second time my jaw dropped at how wonderful the colors, and black and white for that matter, looked. The one thing to watch for when printing and this is with all digital cameras is the ratio size compared to 35mm. You will need to constrain the image a bit in a computer-based software like Photoshop or Paintshop pro to avoid getting part of your image. Simply use the marquee tool and set it to a fixed aspect ratio and the crop the image. Once you have gotten beyond this there is no limit to what you can do with this camera. Try the black and white on this unit also it really does a great job but you might miss the grain. This camera never leaves my side. Anyone want to buy an SLR?","I'll say this right up front:  I love this camera.  It's the third Dimage I've had - previously, I owned the 7 and the 7i, and I *may* go for the A1 soon.<br />It's a fine camera, but it's not a *great* camera.<br />Pros:<br />- solid construction<br />- wonderful manual features, esp. the rotating focus ring<br />- lots of controls to customize shots<br />- excellent zoom lens, that happens to be manual (a plus!)<br />- variety of colorspaces to choose from<br />- uses standard AA batteries<br />Cons:<br />- some noise, mostly on 800 ISO shots<br />- complex to learn<br />- hard to carry around - it's not that heavy, but it's awkward<br />- eats batteries (though this has not been a problem for me, as I just carry a spare set of rechargeables)<br />- rubber ring around zoom lens requires occasional removal and re-taping (as on all of the Dimage 7's)<br />This camera has so many features that it opens a lot of doors for experimentation.  The ones I particularly use:<br />- manual zoom<br />- manual focus<br />- 30 sec bulb exposure<br />- external flash port<br />- good \"sunset\" mode<br />- good video w/ audio<br />- digital viewfinder that switches to B/W in low light<br />- high speed shot mode<br />- excellent digital zoom doubler (2x)<br />For $600 new, the current price, it would be hard to find a camera even close to this quality for $200 more.","I've read all the reviews on this camera, and it is all that people say it is. It has a great feel, and is packed with a ton of fantastic Prosumer features.<br />In all the reviews I have read there is one flaw that seems to appear frequently, .....faulty USB connector.<br />I received my camera, I immediately read the manuals, installed the software, and started shooting (I love the artificial shutter sound). I went to transfer the pictures to my PC (Windoze XP on a P4)... and guess what... It couldn't find the camera.<br />I reread the software and camera manuals 2 times. There are no soft or hard switches to enable the USB port. I set the camera to all possible modes (including transfer) no luck. I tried another USB port, another USB cable, I upgraded the DImage Software, I upgraded the camera's firmware, I tried the cable with my 3030 it worked on all USB ports, I read the flash card through a card reader ...the DImage software found the card and transferred the pictures.<br />The USP Port is broken, faulty, flawed, kaput.<br />Back it goes..<br />Repackaged..<br />Dropped at UPS for return to the merchant... (Tough choice, back to the merchant or to Minolta for repair! I opted to return it to the merchant to avoid the inevitable frustration of proving to the manufacturer that the camera is actually broken, and I'm not retarded... i.e. \"Try this\" \"Try that\" we'll send you new software yada yada yada)<br />Wait 15 days while the wheels of the dot com bureaucracy crank out a replacement camera. (the only bad thing about buying online is returns)<br />If you buy this camera TEST THE USB PORT IMMEDIATELY! I've read of too many USB failures from too many consumer reviews for this to be a coincidence. I think Minolta isn't adquately testing the camera's USB port during it's QA process.<br />I love the camera... I'm happy with my selection... I just wish I didn't have to deal with this one minor issue, and all the time it takes to cure it!<br />P.S. I think my rebate might have gotten hosed in the process.. all the criteria are suddenly not valid (I had to return the camera with the packing slip which was also necessary for the rebate!)<br />Hope this helps.","I've been a shutterbug since elementary school, I'm 41 now and own 7 different cameras 35MM SLR's as well as digital. I purchased the camera on 7/22/03 and the Minolta 7Hi has got to be one of the best camera buys I've ever made. The wide range of options offered in this model is so amazing I thought I was using my Minolta XTSi, which has some of the same features on the 7Hi, the appearance, ergonomics', options, quality and functionality is what set this camera apart from all other Digital's.<br />I love the vivid color option, which really enhances and brings out the rich colors and the picture quality is awesome due to a superbly clean focusing lens.<br />I have experimented with all the picture quality options, but I continue to use the super fine setting, tight grains, and crisp clear pictures.<br />The sports mode setting is awesome; the camera will process the pictures as you continue to snap shots on fast moving items and storing the pictures in the internal memory (64MB) until it's finished writing to the flash card.<br />I bought this camera as a bundled package, case, tripod extra 256MB CF, UV & Polarizing filters, Macro & 2X telephoto lenses with a spare set of rechargeable batteries with charger. The chances are if you are a serious photographer you will want these anyway so it's defiantly a cost savings. I tried to use regular AA bat's (DON'T) this camera is designed to use rechargeable, it will drain the regular AA's in mere minutes!!<br />I did purchase eight (2 Sets) of 2300 mAh batteries and fully charged there's more than enough juice to use up a 256MB Card, worth the investment.<br /><br />I had started out with a low end digital (1.3 MP Olympus), not sure if digital was for me, but after using it I basically grew out and wore out of this one (Sent it in twice for repairs) and was in the market for a more entry level professional model. Looked at the Nikon's, Canons, Fuji ... I didn't settle because I wanted the best quality for my money, so the Minolta 7Hi was the ticket. I'm now getting better picture results with this digital camera and can make the same adjustments as a 35MM SLR, aside from the non interchangeable lens this camera steps up and exceeds the 35MM Film class.<br /><br />The 16MB card supplied with the camera is a joke in my opinion; I don't think it would be too much to ask for Minolta to supply at a minimum 64 or 128 MB CF card.<br /><br />I've played a little with the movie clips but not enough to comment on other than it doesn't seem to stay in focus when I try to zoom in?? This could be user error, due to lack of experience.<br /><br />I have not played with the external flash option yet, but plan to in the near future. The hot shoe option on this model is replaced with a cable type plug-in?? Don't know why other than it's a proprietary thing with Minolta? A way to charge more for a product it seems.<br /><br />Overall if you're a Photonut, take a lot of pictures, and want a little more out of a digital camera, you'll get plenty from the 7Hi.<br />I would give this one 6 stars but only 5 are available!!","This is my fourth digital Camera and my second DiMage camera, I had the DiMage 7 when they first came out for couple of years, then I upgraded to DiMage 7HI about 3 months ago. This is a great camera, the most annoying thing about a digital Camera is you have to wait to take the next photo, but DiMage 7HI has 64mb of internal memory that allows you to do continous shooting, another point it uses AA batteries, I bought 2 additional sets of 1850 MAH rechargable batteries, $20!!,  in addition to one set that came with it, I never run out of power compare that to the proprietry battries from SONY!. Compact Flash CF media is very affordable, I use an IBM 1GB microdrive with this camera, it makes a great combination. Just realize that IBM microdrive has much faster write speed than regualar CF cards that also help speed up your recycle time between shots. You can also use a new hard drive called  Magicstor 2.2GB for $250, I take this camera on vacation for a week, come home with 400 shots of the highest quality!. Auto focus is %99 accurate. 7x optical zoom, fantastic quality. Auto or manual focus, why do you need manual focus?, let's say you want to take a photo of a shiny item, like a diamond or water falls, autofocus will not work with any camera, you have to switch to manual to get the correct shot.","I have bought this camera 2 years ago for 650$ and spent another 350$ for a 1GB CF2 IBM Microdrive. It was one of the best purchase i ever did.","I've been involved with photography for nearly 50 years, and recently went digital. WOW!!! I'm having more fun with the 7Hi than I've had in years.  This camera is capable of doing far, far more than I had any idea was possible. I'm still trying to figure out what all I can do with this camera. The quality of the image on \"very fine\" mode is unbelievable. Between the 7Hi and my new Photoshop Elements 2.0 I'm finding how much fun it is to have a darkroom on my desktop.  The instruction manual is not the easiest thing to use, however; and don't bother with the Dimage Viewer - go straight to Photoshop.<br />This is no camera for for the point and shoot folks.  Aside from the price, this piece requires a bit of photo knowledge to get where you're going.  You can set it up to point and shoot, but there are many better options for that at much lower price.<br />Overall I believe the results achieved by the 7Hi are limited only by the abilities of the photographer.","Minolta Dimage 7Hi along with Nikon CoolPix 5700 and Sony F717 are well known as the leading 5 Megapixels in the market all have advantages and disadvantages over each other. The Dimage 7Hi offers the most manual features familiar to traditional SLR users and professionals because as with most photographers who wants an elements of \"control\" over the outcome of the picture it appeal are geared more to the \"tinkers\". However the Dimage 7Hi has poor battery performance, USB 1.1 and the noise on the images for a camera this price call into question no matter how many manual buttons and options you can play with the final picture is of little if any improvement over the competition. Compared to the Sony F717 which has the least manual features it let the camera do the talking with its more advance faster USB 2.0, long life lithium battery, histogram that gets every picture focus rights in whatever lighting condition, excellent nightshots and with additional infrared filter add on can use as an Xray cam and to top it all a versatile Carl Zeiss lens.<br />If you wants to buy the Dimage 7Hi and you dont mind all the controls then this might be the camera for you, the Sony F717 does not offer as much for you to play with but shoot faster yet both produces equally good pictures (Cons for the F717 is the slight red saturation, the Dimage 7Hi is the noises).<br />My impression of an ideal digital camera is that it do all the hardwork for you, the Minolta does not handle all the hardwork itself but instead gave that back to the user, however I am not a professional photographer and like most mortal I like something that automatically handle most of the work and produces equally good picture as what the Minolta or Coolpix can do, this is what gave the Sony the edge for me.","I've been a serious amateur photographer for at least 50 years.  This is my 3rd digital camera.  It was difficult deciding between the Nikon 5700 and the Minolta 7Hi.  The 28mm capability of the zoom lens plus all the other features made me go for the Minolta.<br />I've not been disappointed.  The lens is absolutely pin sharp.  The Auto focus (a problem with all the Nikon coolpix cameras) is right on for 99.9% of my exposures.  And it focuses quickly.<br />If this camera has a weak point....it is the hot shoe which is a propriatory one which can be used only with Minolta external flash units.  It is a dirty trick that Minolta played and their flash units cost a fortune.  Hopefully Vivitar will come along with a compatible flash unit for the 7Hi.<br />I've never been able to observe the so-called noise that some reviewers have objected to in the images.  Low light level images turn out beautifully.<br />I've tried all the color profile settings while playing around with the various profiles with my HP printer.  I've finally returned to the Normal sRGB setting even though it has a smaller gamut than the Adobe RGB profile.  I seem to realize better compatibility with my printer when I use the sRGB setting.<br />Images made with the camera then blown up to 8 X 10 on matte surface paper have an almost 3 dimensional quality.  Beautiful, rich colors, so sharp it's almost too good to be true.<br />This is the sharpest lens and best camera I've ever owned in my life and I'm 67 years old.  AND, guess what?  The local Micro Center store had a 20% off sale on all digital cameras so I was able to get my 7Hi at a reasonable price from a local dealer without having to fight with high pressure salesmen on the phone.<br />This one is a real keeper.","I spent several months researching the high end amateur digital cameras, looking for (and hoping to find) the ideal camera to pursuade me to give up film photography.  I had a very demanding set of criteria: great lens, at least 5 MP, at least 7X optical zoom, lots of photographic control, Compact Flash and IBM microdrive compatible, non-proprietary rechargeable batteries, and it had to feel really good in my hands.  To my surprize, such a camera does exist - the Minolta Dimage 7Hi. I tried it out at a local store, and was so impressed I immediately ordered it from Amazon.com.  Now, over 4,000 pictures later, I'm absolutely thrilled. This is one awesome camera, that takes incredible pictures. Every feature works like clockwork, and the photo control is terrific. It's solid and even looks great. I've compared my pictures to those of a few friends using Canon and Nikon high-end digicams, and the 7Hi results are as good or better.  I'm a very picky person who's been into photography and darkroom work for over 30 years, and I I've not shot a picture using film since I bought my DImage 7Hi - it's just too good and too much fun.<br />If you want a great digicam, that produces photos that rival the best you've taken with film, this camera won't disappoint.","When John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth, he took a Minolta with him. Forty years later, the quality and ergonomics are still there.<br />When you're looking for a 5MP camera, there are really just two items for the non-pro to consider: this one, and the Nikon Coolpix 5700. I was a Coolpix nut before I moved up to 5MP, but this camera won out, for two reasons: the manual zoom and the processor.<br />Even on the highest-quality setting -- one that will produce a picture of 20 by 25 inches with great resolution -- this camera will take three pictures per second. Think about your toddler son blowing out candles on his birthday cake or your grown-up daughter throwing a bouquet at her wedding and you'll want this camera.<br />The manual zoom is much quicker, and quicker-responding, than the motorized zoom of the Nikon. When you looking for the-right-shot, this is a heckuva boon. I want a nimble camera, and this is it.<br />As this isn't a perfect world, there is a caveat. To get full use of this powerful tool, you'll have to buy some more: Photoshop 7.01 AND the Adobe RAW plug-in. Once you've shelled out the shekels for those, though, you've got a picture-producing system that is just about idiot-proof. With the software you can screw up everything except the focus -- the exposure, the white balance, the lot. The RAW plug-in lets you use the raw (sorry) data from the camera and overcome bad color and bad exposure.<br />I have had this camera for two months and I've taken about 600 pictures. Yes, I've saved only perhaps 150 of them, but that's why we use digital! All of those I have saved are near-enough to professional to satisfy me. Now, if only I can get a fire-wire card reader ...<br />A last note: I bought this camera in Hong Kong, for rather less than what it seems to cost in the U.S. so you might want to look around for sale prices.","Two cameras are at the top of the heap of \"prosumer\" 5 megapixel cameras -- Minolta 7Hi and the Nikon Coolpix 5700.  (The Minolta 7i is a half-step below but less expensive; Sony's 717 is a full step behind but worth a look.)  Minolta has it all if you're used to an SLR: a zoom ring rather than the motorized step-zoom familiar to users of video cameras; a manual focus mode that uses an SLR-like focus ring; and a very useful zoom range -- effectively 28 - 200 mm vs. the Coolpix's 35 - 280 mm.  For landscapes and interior shots 28 mm is better than 35 mm and you'd need a tripod to get good shots with the Nikon's longest telephoto setting.  The Minolta fits well in one's hands -- better than the Nikon 5700.  Nikon has a flip-out LCD panel, but it's small.  Though the Monolta's big LCD panel doesn't flip out, the viewfinder rotates up.  (Be sure to adjust the diopter dial for the viewfinder to match your vision.)<br />The controls are logically laid out and the important ones are easy to access from dials on the camera, without having to go through little menus on the LCD screen.  But you need to familiarize yourself, because there are lot of options.  Sit down with the manual and camera for a couple of hours and take some pictures with the various settings --contrast, saturation, manua focus, spot meter, etc. etc.  The Minolta manual is pretty good, although there's no index.<br />The resolution is very good - a close-enough replacement for 35 mm film.  At the finest JPEG setting, 16 x 20 enlargements should be OK, even with a bit of cropping.  There is \"noise\" (like graininess in high-speed film) if the camera is set to act like ISO 400 or 800 film, but if it's set at ISO 100 or 200 it's not a major problem.  You can also shoot in \"RAW\", the Minolta-specific data format used by the camera before it creates the JPEG file.  If you do that, spend an extra few $ and download a Photoshop/Photoshop Elements plug-in ...it lets you tune RAW images far more effectively than the ... software Minolta supplies with the camera, and it opens them directly into the Adobe software.<br />Minolta uses standard rechargeable AA NiMH batteries (don't use alkaline!) and the camera comes with a good charger, but it takes few cycles of charging for them to reach full staying power and even then you'll need an extra set of batteries -- get 2000 mA rechargeables (or higher), which will outlast the 1800 mA ones supplied with the camera.  Fortunately they're inexpensive compared to the proprietary batteries in Nikon and Canon cameras.  You'll also want to buy a 49 mm UV or Skylight filter to protect the lens and you absolutely have to buy a CompactFlash card.  Minolta gives you a 16 MB card that holds only a handful of high-resolution images. (Nikon's 32 MB card is only marginally better.) Buy a CF card with 256 or 512 MB -- preferaby SanDisk or Lexar because some other brands don't work with the Minolta.  A 512 MB CF card will hold about 100 images at the higest-quality JPEG setting.  You'll also want Adobe Elements or another good image editing software.  When you add up the accessories you'll spend another 25%-35% over and above the cost of the camera (not including the cost of a printer), but you'll have a very versatile, light-weight, high resolution camera to enjoy.","As the only prosumer camera with an equivalent 28mm lens, this camera stands alone.  Add to this the ability to control almost every aspect of the image, and you have one great camera.<br />I was astonded at the image quality this camera produces, and the fit and finish are of a high quality as well.<br />My only reservations are the cost, the styling, and the fact that Minolta's software is required to process RAW images.  It would be preferable to be able to capture a RAW tiff even considering the considerable file size required to do so.<br />Please investigate other competing prosumer cameras; but, for overall capability this camera is at the top of the list.","The best batteries for this power-hungry camera are probably the Maha Powerex 1800's. The Sanyo rechargables that shipped with my 7Hi are almost useless. One flash picture and they're gone.<br />Two or three sets and a charger and you'll be able to shoot through the heaviest holidays. I took 91 pictures during christmas and didn't have to change batteries once!<br />My friends continually praise my 7Hi's quality (as if the photographer had nothing to do with the results!!!)<br />Get in line for a 7Hi, and you'll be rewarded with great photos for years to come.","The price is rather steep, but in return you get a feature-packed camera. Like most Minolta products you have total control over all settings, which implies a bit of a learning curve, but gives you great flexibility one you're broken in.<br />My only complaint is a somewhat short battery life. Fortunately it uses standard AA size NiMH batteries, so you can purchase an extra set anywhere and carry it with you!","Feature-packed but easy to use.  For the quickshot, just remove the lens cap, turn the control dial from \"off\" to \"record\", turn the zoom ring on the lens while composing, press the shutter release part way to focus and meter then all the way down to take the picture.  About one second later you can take another one.  Buttons and dials are very intuitive.  While composing and enjoying the full information viewfinder you can roll the function wheel, located just behind the shutter button, to change the f/stop-shutter combination.  The autofocus draws a red box around the object focused on.  If by chance the autofocus selected the wrong object, just turn the focus override ring on the lens until the correct object is in focus.  The auto and manual focus are both very fast, accurate, and work great in low light.  The viewfinder autoswitches to black and white in extreme low light to make autofocusing easier.  For great skin tones, press the mode button to select portrait.  For continuous focusing and high shutter speed press it again for action.  Again for scenery, nightshots, or document photo.  Button on side toggles between manual and auto focus.  Function dial in combination with function wheel allows you to scroll through any combination of compensations for color, contrast, brightness, ISO equivalent (100-800), burst frame speed (up to 7fps), exposure control (program, aperture, shutter, or manual), and metering mode.  This same dial is used to control what type of bracketing you want to do in burst mode.  For normal pictures, you can leave everything in automatic.  For unusual situations you can apply manual override.  Built-in flash casts a soft light on the subject rather than the harsh light by some point-and-shoots.  If you want super flash power using your old manual flash rather than buying a compatible new automatic shoe-mounted external flash, you can attach any pc-cord type external flash and set the exposure to manual.  Press the info and function buttons at same time to see a much brighter viewfinder when manually controlling exposure.  There is also a button that quickly resets your controls to programmed automatic in case you don't want to individually return the controls to automatic.  I chose over the Nikon Coolpix 5700 because in-store model 5700 did not focus very fast, 7Hi uses standard filters (49mm) without adapters, 7Hi 28mm equivalent wide angle gets more people in the picture, the 7Hi 200mm equivalent telephoto matched anything I ever needed in my SLR film camera, 7Hi has dual range macro allowing me to focus at the telephoto setting so I get the shot without casting shadows on the tiny subject, and the 7Hi uses standard AA batteries.  The battery charge life is a bit short but I do not believe I would swap any feature it has for longer battery life.  I simply carry at least two spare sets of batteries and the charger on my outings.  Under moderate use I get about two hours of use per charge.  Drops to just over an hour for heavier use.  Recharge time is 4 hours.  To me the functionality and results are well worth the slight battery inconvenience.  The 2560x1920 resolution makes great photos.","I recently purchase this camera and Im very impress with it.  I still trying to figure it completely, cause is loud it with all the bells and whistle.  What i love the most about this camera is the fact that i can use the minolta flash wireless.  To me that is a plus hard to match.  Is small, light, easy to travel on this days.  I carry this camera with me everywhere with two flashes and it become a portable studio.","This is Digital Camera #4 for me. Started out with a Fuji Finepix 2800 and loved it. Moved to a Fuji Finepix 4900 and loved it. Wanted a small digital camera to carry in a pocket so I bought the Sony P5. I still keep it with me where ever I go. Wanted to to move to a Prosumer type camera and after hours of research I decided on the Minolta Dimage 7Hi.  GREAT CAMERA - I had to go back to Photography 101 to remember all the different aspects of photography once I left the fully automatic mode. This camera is nearly professional level, only missing interchangable lens. This camera may be my last digital camera purchase.","I've been using a variety of 35mm SLR cameras for more than three decades and I place great importance on the feel of the camera in my hand. I approached my recent purchase of a 5MP camera with some early leaning towards Nikon since I've worked with two of their CoolPix cameras. I tried to do my homework on the web and am aware of most +'s and -'s.<br />The hands-on experience sold me on the Minolta 7Hi. I love the fact that there is manual control, on the lens, of the zoom. I love the fact that the camera permits \"DMF\" or direct manual focus, which allows you to take advantage of a fast autofocus system that feels much faster than the Nikon (35mm or CoolPix), and THEN to tweak it manually with a ring on the lens. I love the fact that the LCD switches off whenever you put the camera up to your eye to use the electronic viewfinder (EVF).<br />About four weeks of shooting in Islamorada, Miami, and New York have only strengthened the love affair. This is one great camera. The images, both on screen and printed are gorgeous. I don't print at >=11X14 and the noise is so much better (to my eye) than my earlier digital cameras that I can not say it is a problem. The 12bit A/D and the 64MB RAM buffer in the camera are really nice additions that I think are not found in the other two 5MP choices. The UHS (ultra high speed) mode is incredible.....we're going to use that in my research laboratory in ways that I hadn't even imagined at the time I chose the camera (thanks to an adaptor from Brunel Microscopes in UK) . Finally, I think they designed the menus in a very easy to learn way. Nikon menus (880, 990, 995) always seemed a bit impenetrable to me. But, I move through all the 7Hi menus all the time and had little difficulty keeping straight how to do what where. This is a real credit to those who designed the user interface.<br />I've added a spare set of 4 AA 1850mAh batteries and (now that each set has been cycled 3-4 times) this will be more than enough for many hundreds of 5MP shots. I also sprang for a 49mm UV filter, a couple of high speed 256MB CF cards and am considering a firewire CF card reader. Otherwise, the bundle is complete.<br />My single most significant gripe is that the Minolta software crashes all the time under Mac OS X 10.2. The current Mac version is useless, while the Windows version seems OK. But, this isn't the camera's fault, presumably is something that Minolta will fix soon, and really only limits your use of RAW images. Photoshop, Canvas, or iPhoto all work fine.<br />This is a real camera that just happens to store the images digitally rather than on film. I'd say this camera finally delivers on the digital promise.","This thing becomes better and better. Minolte Dimage is the only camera in market ( I guess ) with wide , long zoom combined with 5 mega pixels."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-F717","amazon_reviews":["Great buy","I have the exact same camera but mine says it's got a 10x Precision digital Zoom.

Since then I have taken some incredible pictures. I have never been more happy or pleased with another camera I have owned.  It has a 5x Optical Zoom lens and long life battery and has a built in flash. It does night photo’s and some video. If your Memory stick is large enough for doing video.  If you are someone who is a Photo enthusiast this has some really cool advanced features. Myself I like the full auto functionality of it. It knows what to do to take a perfect picture and will if you let it. After you have taken your pictures you can use the USB cable to download you pictures. I also like the eye piece or the screen on the back. If you wish to hold the camera up to your eye to size out and take the picture or if you want to tilt the lens and use the screen take pictures from any other position other than from looking through the eyepiece.<br /><br />The only thing I don’t like is that is a bit bulky and does not make it easy just to carry around. You are using it because you want to use it and there is just not any easier way to carry it other than around your neck or in a bag. If you carry it in the bag then you have to dig it out to get it ready to shoot some picks. If you have it around your neck for a long period of time it can be a pain.<br /><br />Other than size this camera is perfect and takes perfect pictures.","I have especially enjoyed this camera's infra red (night shot, when paired with neutral density filters and IR filter, and 1/60s exposures), as well as its superior macro photography performance (especially when paired with Sony Macro lens extension).  These are results I dare say top anything I've taken with a DSLR, simply because of the still superior swivel lens ergonomic design..<br /><br />The one glaring exception was the fact that the hotshoe was defective on my unit, and this was not mentioned in the seller's original description, although the seller has offered a full refund including shipping which is commendable.<br /><br />In the end, I decided to keep the camera, because I did not want to give up on the relative good condition of this camera.","For an older camera this one was well taken care of and works perfectly.  True nightshot makes it a valuable tool in my profession.","I bought this camera new in 2003 at London Drugs. When the CCD failed four years ago, Sony replaced it at no charge. The swivel barrel lens allows you to get unique ground shots. The user-programmable settings are adequate for most users. Don't let the 5 megapixels deter you from acquiring one of these cameras. The lens quality (Carl Zeiss) is second to none and is great for 8x10 photos at high resolution. I won't sell mine!","Since 2003 till now and still one of the best cameras to use , great clear pictures while viewing by lcd tv or led tv ,<br />Thousands of pictures took by this camera and each time i use it i feel satisfied","This is not my first camera of this make/model.  We have been using this same model at the fire station for years.  We are using this for our FD action and fire investigation photos.

It clearly defines the strands of hair in a tiny bird nest.","I had a Sony DSC F707 that I wore out and wanted a similar replacement. The F717 is the newer improved model. The newer one has some improvements that I don't like. They moved the zoom button to an akward position. They also do not allow you to change the exposure level in auto program mode. It does take very good pictures.","I have owned several of these cameras and love them.  They take wonderful pictures.

I liked it so much that I bought a second.  And a few years later, a third.  The ergonomics of this camera are unparalleled by any modern (2010) camera I am aware of.  Holding it by the lens, you can quickly twist the body up or down to get candid people shots (lens up) or above a crowd (lens down).  Battery life is superb.  Because there's no lens to extend/retract, it comes on quick, and there's little drain for a quick on/off shot or two.  It is not unusual to have this camera sitting on a shelf for a few months, and being able to take 50 pictures.<br /><br />The lens is very fast by modern standards, which allows good low-light performance.  Its laser focusing system provides perfectly-focused shots in pitch darkness (with flash of course) and its infrared light source yields usable images in total darkness.<br /><br />One of its nicest features for the serious photographer is that you can view a live histogram in the electronic viewfinder.  Trust it, tweak the exposure to optimize dynamic range if required, and you'll get superb exposures with none of the 'duds' that are common on point/shoots.<br /><br />btw this is a 'weird' looking camera, which I've found is an advantage in exotic locations, as it doesn't attract attention like an SLR.  The camera is light and compact enough to stash in a jacket pocket.","Being a gardener I like to document what grows at different times of the year from miniscule buds to flowers, shrubs & trees. This camera is an easy to use general workhorse for me. Because of the rotating body I no longer need to kneel down in the mud to capture an up close portrait of a snowdrop as it emerges in the spring. I can hold the camera over my head and capture a shot of a flower posed higher than I've grown.<br /><br />The 5mg image capture size is perfect for the documentation I'm looking for in this context.<br /><br />It is easy to use, no fuss, no frills.<br /><br />There are many cameras to choose from since I bought my original DSC F707 but, when I made a major mistake and left in out on the garden bench for a few days in the rain, I was lost without it. My other cameras just didn't fill the bill for this type of work.<br /><br />So I bought the newer DSC F717, even though it is no longer being manufactured by Sony. That's how much I like the style and simplicity of the camera.","I have had this camera for 5 years, and taken several thousand photos.  It is as close to an SLR as you can get.  The optics are very good, photos all come out excellent.  It's not a compact pocket camera, but then neither is any really high quality camera with a first-class lens.  The optical zoom range of 5x is very good and there is no discernible image deterioration at any focal length. The white balance feature is flexible and better than on many much more expensive cameras. The tilting lens-body combination is a great asset and very useful at events where you hasveb to take pictures over other people's heads. I have since added a Nikon D90 to get up to 300 mm; it has 12 MP but I rarely use more than 6.","I got my first Sony f717 in about 2002 after a lot of research and looking at sample pics on Steve's Digicam. I loved that camera and between the two 717's I owned previously I have taken about 27,000 pictures. My dog knocked over my tripod and smashed the first one against a rock. So I immediately bought another. Didn't even consider anything else. This is back when they were still $600. Second one stolen about a year ago. Although wanted to use this excuse to \"upgrade\", I started remembering how much I liked my 717 and found there are a lot available on ebay and are pretty cheap now. Hmmm...  got another one.<br /><br />There are many features I like about it.<br />1. Takes really great pictures. Although it doesn't do too well with intense reds occasionally, it more than makes up for it with how well it does whites, esp white flowers and everything else. Rarely a problem anyway. Some of my favorites shots with it were red flowers and leaves.<br />2. Unbelievably good macro function. You can take incredibly crisp pics almost touching the lens. Autofocus still works great that close. The macro function actually sees much better than I do and it is routine for me to see stuff in picture when on the computer I didn't see when taking the shot. Got some great tiny insects on flowers inadvertantly. Love the macro on this camera, love it! One macro of a rare salmon colored cactus flower is my favorite computer background.<br />3.Very easy to hold, lens is perfect size to fit in hand. Optical zoom is easy and good.<br />4. Fast to take pics. While apparently not quite as fast as it's successor the 828, it is still faster now than many new digitals I have used. Makes taking lots of pics of same subject (to luck into a good one) much easily and less frustrating.<br />5. Takes great night shots. I like to take pictures in the very bright moonlight of the Colorado highcountry.<br />6. Battery life is superb. Both how many pics per charge and how long they last. Mine never went bad with all those pics.<br /><br />If you get one, add a UV filter (mainly to protect lens from scratches) and a good circular polarizer for most outdoor shots. Hoya circular polarizer is easy to find on ebay. Also this camera, though point and shoot takes screw on 58mm filters and telephoto etc.","LOVE this camera! It is a replacement for one that was stolen and it is just the best.<br />The seller was a dream to deal with, absolutely fantastic!!!","Years later still going strong. The Optical Zoom is still the strong point of this camera. I have a Nikon digital SLR and Canon 14.7 MP Powershot and this Sony is still my favorite and old reliable. I have taken fantastic photos over the 6 years I have had it. I would never part with it.","My DSCF717 went bad 2 summers ago while taking pictures of my son in a baseball tournament.  I went out then next day to get a Nikon D40X, which is a great camera as well.  But since then, I've kept my DSCF717 stored away, and it was just on a whim 2 weeks ago when I was thinking what a great camera it is (mainly due to the multi-burst function which is awesome, particularly when taking a batter's swing!).  I went online to figure out what the problem was and sure enough it was the bad chip problem!  I'd like to mention that Sony has extended the free replacement of this to March 2009!  My camera is in repair to Sony right now, and I can't wait to use this camera again.","This is a great camera, I shoot aircraft and post on line. Pictures look good","I like so many others, love this camera, because it does so much, and does so much well. I, also like most others, had to send my camera back to Sony when the CCD element (which is the subject of a recall) went bad. Sony fixed it free of charge, and sent it back, and it has performed flawlessly ever since.<br />If only it hadn't gone bad on the first day of my 10 day disney vacation with my wife and 4 year old son.<br />I've used other digital cameras, and without exception I remember wishing I had my camera instead. I still see no reason to upgrade to a newer version yet, and I've taken over 15000 photos with this camera. When the time comes, I'll definitely look at the current model in this line.","I bought mine back when most of the reviews (below) were written - back in in December 2002. I paid about $700 for mine at the time and have taken thousands of superb quality photos with this camera. so why write a review now?<br /><br />Since it is still listed for sale there are a couple of things to point out that a buyer should know:<br /><br />A big issue for digital photography back in 2002 - was the 1/2-1 second photo delay between pressing the button and the shutter actually releasing. Any parent out there knows how critical that 1/2 a second can be when it comes to capturing a child at play or that tender moment when siblings give each other a hug. They are gone in an instant - so you'll need to take that into account when taking pictures.<br /><br />Another issue is a flaw that Sony has with the CCD chips in these cameras. What would happen is the LCD display would start to show static or frequency distortions. These distortions would show up on the photographs. There was actually a class action lawsuit against Sony to repair the CCD chips in cameras experiencing this issue. The time frame for the repair according to the suit ended in October 2007 - which is when I started to experience the issue with my camera. But Sony has extended the free repair until September of this year. Mine is currently in a UPS box on its way to Sony for repair.<br /><br />So if you are looking to buy this camera - verify that the CCD chip has already been replaced - and if not - make sure you send yours in before September 2008.<br /><br />Despite the repair issue - this camera is still a great buy. Nice to know I could sell mine after nearly 6 years and still get a good price for it.","After four years of enjoying the ease and superb quality of this camera I am mourning its demise.  Yes, after four years of being left in cars (feezing nights, Phoenix days)being abused by our now 4 year old son, being dropped, banged and even taken apart a few times it has finally bit the dust.  (by the way I don't recommend subjecting any of these abuses to your own personal camera).  We have stopped paying large sums of money to portrait studios for family pics and even had many pics with this camera published in two local newspapers and our city brochure.  All of our family and freinds used to request that we bring our camera to any and all events as the pictures produced were quite fantabulous.  My husband has photographed many bugs, spiders and even a book worm within an inch with clear detail so he can then research and identify them.  I am sorry that Sony has discontinued this model.  In my search for something that equals this one-of-a-kind, I have purchased the Sony DSC-H9 which even though sports 3 whole megapixals more cannont even come close to the quality I am used to with the DSCF717, so I have returned it.  So on with my trek to find something simple to use, within price and with the same awesome quality I have enjoyed from this camera.  Fare thee well loyal DSCF717, you will be missed.","I purchased one of the DSC 717's several years ago and this I LOVE this camera. It is still one of the best cameras out there, even though it was made in 2002. I love that I can flip the lens up so I can use this camera like a camcorder. I love the photos it takes in all light situations. It does a great job when I use it as a manual camera or an automatic. The only downside is this is a large camera, so it doesn't fit in your pocketbook (unless you have a LARGE bag). To me I'd rather it be large than miss out on all the great features it has. My camera goes with me everywhere. Thanks to Sony for making such a great product.","I bought a Sony DSCF717 as a present for myself just after my divorce about 6 years ago.  Since that time I have taken literally thousands of pictures, some of which just blow me away.  It's a fairly big camera, but I was able to get a fanny pack at WalMart that it fits into just perfectly, along with a wide angle lens I got on ebay that screws onto the lens that comes as part of the camera.  The first section of the wide angle lens screws off and what is then left is a macro lens.  You are walking along and see an insect on a flower, no problem.  You see a hawk on a branch, no problem.  Your kid fell asleep in a dim room with a angelic espression, no problem. The thing that struck me with this camera soon after I got it was that you are able to photograph anything in any light situation, including pitch dark.  Also, the zoom, even the digital zoom, will take you right up to the subject, and with the Zies lens on there, will give you brilliant pictures.  The camera also twists so that you can hold it at your waist and walk around at a party and shoot people up close that barely know you are taking pictures.  Also, with the twist of the camera, you don't have to get down on your belly on the ground to get a close up face on picture of your dog in the grass.  You can put the camera down there and frame your shot by looking down onto the LCD.  I can't sing high enough praises of this camera.  However, I am one inch away from getting a Sony A100 right now to have the experience of the newer technology.  But I would never consider selling the DSCF717.  It may be impossible for any other camera to replace it completely.  I see these for sale now for just over $200 if you look around.  It's not a snapshot camera, although you can use it like that, but rather a real creative tool with a fantastic lens.  Good luck and take care.","Cam started taking foggy pics after three years.  Called up Sony and they said it was something about a lens out of line and they would repair it totaly free(shipping as well).  Pretty good customer service on Sony's side.","I bought this camera in March 2003 and it has taken many great photo's. Suddenly, in late 2006, some photo's all had the \"white fog\" problem and it soon completely failed with all photo's having the problem. I just found out today that this is a known problem and am trying to get a repair. I do like this camera - when it works, it does everything I want in a digital still camera. If I can't get it repaired, then it's bye bye Sony. Wish me luck.","After almost 4 years of use, I had the white fog too.  I was concerned after reading some of the reviews that I would have to pay for a repair.  I am happy to report that Sony is taking care of all shipping and repair costs!  If anyone is having the white fog problem, go to Sony's website and call their customer service number.  It only took me 10 mintues to get it taken care of!  This has been a fantastic camera.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little bulky to carry.  I think it is worth it for the great pictures it takes!","DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. Although, it is an awesome camera and will take amazing pictures, it will without a doubt break after 2 or 3 years of use for no reason whatsoever. I bought this camera brand new about 3 years ago, and absolutely LOVED it. The pictures were amazing...crisp, colorful etc.<br /><br />BUT...There are deffective pieces that are used in this camera that have not been recalled by sony. Google it, you'll find plenty of reading material about it.<br /><br />I used my camera about 3 weeks ago and everything was fine...took it out again about a week later and it would not work. The pictures were over-exposed regardless of any settings I used. This was not user error...I've had this camera for 3 years and used it all the time, I knew this camera about as well as anyone could...the camera just stopped functioning properly. I've given up trying to read online how to fix it. It's a bit out-dated anyways at this point and instead I'm looking at an upgrade. I recommend Canon or Nikon. They may cost more, but at least they'll last.<br /><br />Hope this helps. It's a shame Sony won't correct their problem...otherwise I'd be upgrading to a new Sony instead of switching brands.","I got my 717 in Dec. 2003. in the U.S. I have taken about 5000+ photos, with no problems! 3 days ago, I went to take a pic of my son and the screen looked like a wet painting that ran. I reset the cam. and recharged the batt. and it was still the same. I'm here in Europe right now, so my wife called the big Sony store. The guy said he never heard of this before, but we can send it for service. When we took it to the store the kid said, \"sure these have problems\" it's costing me approx. $80 just to send it in, and they my or my not charge for the repair. Only now I found all these other stories. So the jury is still out, I don't know what I'm in for? 5 stars for the cam. 1 star for it taking a %&\"$","With my Sonvy F717 I've taken team fast action photos for three and a half years:  lacrosse, softball, baseball, football, and indoor basketball and racquetball.  I've also photographed weddings, senior portraits, candid photos, still life, and movies for nature videos and family reunions.<br /><br />1- outside photos are crisp, even in mid-air, and I can stop the ball!<br /><br />2- with digital cameras there is a delay - we have to learn to anticiapte the shot.<br /><br />3- inside fluorescent lights and motion cause blurs.  I take constant photos of the action, then sort them at home.  I always find great pictures of each player.<br /><br />4- I've combined my camera with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Elements.  My teams love my end of year videos with music, slides, movie clips and special effects. (just movie clips tend to be boring) I've also created wedding videos, newsletters, wedding and birthday cards, flyers - - we're only limited by our imagination.<br /><br />5- my son cut out a picture of himself hanging from a limb, and pasted it onto the wing of his grandfather's airplane!  It looked real!","I have Purchased this camera 3 years back and still it rocks. My other friends bought other new models arrived in the market and they always compare it with f717. This is really a great camera. Recently i had a problem with the LCD, but sony repaired it for free. Only concern i had was the weight, but with all the good features weight is not a big problem.","I have had this camera for about 3 years and it is like a part of my family.  Honestly, everyone loves my camera.  We take a lot of pictures and it rarely disappoints. There is, however, a problem with it that Sony fixes for free.  Mine started blurring and taking pictures that almost looked like negatives.  I had to send it to them and they turned it around in about 3 weeks.  The Sony website has all the information.  Still, even with that problem, I wouldn't trade my camera for all the newer ones.  I'm very happy with it.","I've owned this camera for a couple of years now and it has never let me down. Very durable and long battery life. Has nightshot and takes video's.Takes beautiful still pics and with my sony digital printer, I have alot of great pics. You may not think 5mp's is enough but it really is. It has an e-mail setting so you can take pics that are just the right size for e-mailing. You can print 8and half by eleven pics with no problem, and at the current prices this camera is a steal, I paid a $1000. for mine. So get it and have fun.","This was my first digital camera.  I have shot more than 12,000 photos with my camera and it never skipped a beat.  I even dropped it on concrete (not recommended) and after a few seconds, it came back on and shot thousands of pictures since.  It is perfect for someone who wants a step up from the point and shoot, but isn't ready for pro SLR.<br /><br />  The only reason I am not using it now is that I have simply outgrown it.  There are some limitations, like continuous shooting, and the ISO is only up to 400, but it has enough features for the common photographer.  I shot many horse racing photos and actually sold my prints, so it does adequate high speed and sports.  It was a little limited with inside a gym, but the photos were fair.  Did excellent portraits and candid shots of people and animals.<br /><br />  If you get the chance to get a good deal on this camera, take it.  You won't be disappointed.","After 3 years of excellent pictures, I got the white fog.<br /><br />I read about the faulty CCD and went to Sony Service to get a repair quote.<br /><br />They called me after 2 days saying my camera was fixed and ready.<br /><br />The pleasant surprise: Sony has extended the warranty on the lens assy (apparently CCD & Lens is 1 piece).<br /><br />Invoice Total = 0$.<br /><br />Way to go Sony!","In short: check out [...]<br /><br />Three day ago (March 24th, 2006), I got an \"important notice\" from Sony in my email:<br /><br />\"This notice is to inform you about a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit titled Bruce Chabansky v. Sony Electronics Inc., (the \"Action\"), the Court's conditional certification of a settlement class in that Action, and of a hearing to consider the settlement.  The Action alleges that certain digital still camera and camcorder models sold and marketed by Sony Electronics Inc. (\"SEL\"), and manufactured by a separate entity before March 2004, are defective in that they include a component known as a CCD imager that fails at an abnormally high rate causing a blank liquid crystal display (\"LCD\") screen and electronic viewfinder or causing a distorted image to appear on the LCD screen and electronic viewfinder rendering the camera and camcorder incapable of taking pictures and recording video, respectively. SEL denies these claims, and denies that anyone has been harmed or deserves compensation in relation to these claims.  The Court has not made a decision on the merits.<br /><br />\"If you purchased one of the models at issue, at retail, or received one of the models as a gift from the original purchaser, you may be a member of the settlement class (\"Settlement Class\") that will be a party to a settlement agreement that resolves and forever dismisses the Action.  Under the terms of the settlement, members of the Settlement Class are eligible to receive a CCD imager repair-or-reimbursement remedy from SEL under limited conditions.  Please see the complete notice of the proposed settlement at [...] or telephone (866) 703-7669 to obtain a copy  of the complete notice which includes details regarding the requirements to be eligible for the repair-or-reimbursement remedy and how to receive the remedy if you are eligible.  If the proposed settlement is approved by the Court, the person who filed the Action and two others who filed a similar lawsuit in Wisconsin will receive an additional service award of $1,500 each, and the attorneys for the plaintiff in this Action will apply for an award of attorney's fees.  These awards and attorney's fees, however, will not affect the relief available to members of the Settlement Class.  All claims of the Settlement Class members which were or could have been asserted in the Action based on the facts alleged therein, will be forever released, if this settlement is approved by the Court.\"<br /><br />I hope this solves the problems other reviewers have or had. (I haven't had any problem with my camera (yet?)).<br /><br />A big thank you to Bruce Chabansky and the others who filed the lawsuits!","After 2 years of great performance and over 5000 pics taken, camera started taking blurry, like in thick fog covered pictures. No matter what mode, pics are unusable.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, my problem is not covered by recall, so Sony rep told me. Somehow they were able to estimate repair cost over the phone ($ 185). I didn't expect my camera to quit working after two years, that is why I chose well known brand and paid lot of money for it. I am not paying for repair. At the moment, working F717 is worth about $300, so it doesnt make sense to invest any more money into it. I am very dissapointed with Sony and I understand that they don't really care about loosing one customer, after all they have so many...<br /><br /> I am doing research for new one, so far Olympus E300 looks very good to me. Can get it for about $600 fairly equiped.<br /><br /> Good luck to all F717 owners. See you later with different brand :-)<br /><br /> Martin","Awesome camera, takes excellent pictures and it looks stunningly beautiful and appealing, wherever i go people inquire about it.....and the pictures that i take with it never disappoints. I read about many people talking about it strange barrel lens that makes holding it difficult but i believe it is very well designed and it fits in comfortably in my hands.....battery life is just awesome, it just keeps on going and going.....response time(after u click) is bit slower but much better than many other digital camera which i have seen, unless u think that u will be very often in a position where u really need to take real quick pics, this camera should do the job for u.....if one have to write about this camera's great features it will easily extend to many pages....gist of all is this a beautiful camera which takes stunningly beautiful shots-no matter what the conditions are and erybdy in my famly loves it....GREAT CAMERA!!!!!!!!","Not as good as their 8 megapixel camera, but still good value for an amateur.  For most people, the difference between the two resolutions won't be noticed.  The camera has many of the features of it's high-priced brother, and still has the same flexibility of letting you decide how much control to exercise over exposure and focus.","I LOVE this camera!  It is quite easy to use right out of the box; but your pictures just get better and better as you read the manual and learn to do all that this camera is capable of!  I get great pictures up to 11x14 and beyond.  People are always stunned by how crystal clear my portraits are and how wonderful the colors come through.<br /><br />My one caution is be careful with the zoom.  If you do not turn off the digital zoom, you can use it without realizing you are using it and your pictures can be somewhat grainy.  When I turn the digital zoom off, I get amazingly clear pictures every time.  I bought this camera with a package of lenses and other accessories for $1,500 so I would definitely recommend it at this new LOWER price!","I have been using the camera about for 2 years. Excellent quality of pictures, excellent quality of printed big size photos, wonderful optics - all of these are true (I'm a very picky person for quality of photos). But once I found myself in situation when this camera was virtually useless. I needed to take pictures of fast moving objects in low light condition. It was a dancing competition. That was only a case when I could not make any satisfactory pictures with SONY DSCF717 camera.","I bought this camera a year ago and have not been disappointed. I'm an amateur, but this camera produces professional results. My only complaint is the size of the camera (it's quite large), but I like the design and it has a ton of features. To see some examples of my F717 pics, visit [...]","IM NOT A PHOTOGRAPHER BY NO MEANS. BUT I LIKE TO HAVE A CAMERA AROUND TO TAKE PICTURES WHENEVER I CAN EITHER OF MY BOYS OR BEFORE AND AFTERS OF PROJECTS AT THE HOUSE. I ACTUALLY GOT A CARRYING CASE FOR IT AND ACC. I TAKE IT EVERYWHERE I GO. ALSO GOT A PRINTER TO GO WITH IT. WHAT WONDERFUL PICTURE THAT I CAN TAKE. IMAGINE IF I KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT TAKING A PICTURE WHAT I COULD DO. A FRIEND HAS SAME CAMERA AND HE FEELS THE SAME WAY.","I did my usual research at amazon, dpreview, etc etc and decided on this one and have used it for almost a year. Even if the 828 is out and this one is kind of a relic, I cannot imagine needing anything more than this in a digcam and want to recommend it specifically because there would be lots of used units at great prices now in the market. What are the best things about it?<br />Just read all the issues with the Nikon 5700 (my comparison is mainly with the Nikon, which I have used). The 717 outscores the Nikon in all those areas (excellent autofocus, not clumsy to handle, very fast response time, and simply the best battery - 300 pics without a problem - i charge my battery once a fortnight if even).<br />Picture quality is fantastic. I am not a pro, and I do not need anything more than the quality and crispness that this camera offers.<br />But the biggest plus, I think, is its great quality in \"auto\" mode. My friends can simply aim and shoot and get a great result - all of us typically take a lot of pictures at fun times, and aim n shoot quality really matters at those times.<br />What else? Excellent flash quality. I also love the way the lens bends up and down - I used it to great effect when shooting a wedding - it gives you angle flexibility that no camera can match. It's also extremely sturdy, and I really love the way it stays in the grip. Lastly, the Carl Zeiss lens is of superb quality and the 5X optical zoom is more than I can ever need.<br />Negatives? Maybe a couple. Initially, I found a lot of pics, particularly in bright sunlight, to be either milky or bluish. This can be solved by using the white meter optimally as well as by managing exposure well, and also with filters - I just needed to spend some time with the camera. Also, the camera necessarily needs a U/V filter (not a big deal for $20).<br />Like many others I was hesitant to choose a Sony over Nikon and Canon, but clearly in the non-SLR class, Sony is teaching the pro companies a lesson or two.<br />Overall, great buy, simply the best in its class - probably barring the 828 which I have not used.","I have never bought anything high-tech for my software executive husband before I bought this camera. I spent a week on line and reading reviews here and decided this was the right pick. Not only was this the right pick it was a HOME RUN!! This is a great camera. I would recommend the digital photo printer (DPP-EX7) and a real nice Tumi bag to carry the camera in. We have had a blast with this camera. It's great quality and has that \"cool factor\" as well. We recently took a trip to Walt Disney World and bought the T1 to take instead of this one because this is a bit huge and love both cameras. We are now big Sony fans. I highly recommend this camera.","I've had this camera for 5 months, I haven't had a single problem with it. You will be amazed with the array of features this camera has. I still discover new features everyday. This camera is also a HEADTURNER! I took it to a prom and a few parties, it attracts so much attention. The pop-up flash is very cool. Let's look at why I love this camera so much.<br />The Pros:<br />- Excellent quality and crisp pictures<br />- Rechargeable battery wiht grrrreat battery life. Takes atleast 300 shots in the highest quality picture setting (The last one I had barely even took a 100.)<br />- 5X ZOOM!!! It is great! trust me.<br />- Flash is great, even in complete darkness<br />- Auto/Manual Focus, Many different modes to take pictures<br />- Nightvision is amazing.<br />- FAST USB 2.0 Connection, camera acts as a removable HD<br />- VIDEO! you can take great quality videos, and the length is only limited by the size of the memorystick.<br />- Charges quickly (in about 3 hours)<br />CONS:<br />- POOR WARRANTY, only 90 days. I'd recommend buying an extended warranty for it, even though I don't have one.<br />- Memory stick is expensive.<br />But I really think you will not be disappointed with this camera. Having used many cameras, I'd recommend this over any other camera in this range.","I bought this camera a year ago and it's been absolutely wonderful!  I use it all the time, in fact, I used it this morning to snap some pics of my boyfriend before work.  It is easy to use even if you don't know how to use the manual features since it has automatic settings also.  Takes amazing pictures, has macro and nightshot/nightframing!!!  The only drawback is its size.","I am so happy with my camera.  We have been living in Europe for a while and have traveled all over. I was tired of not getting good shots with our other digital camera because it had no zoom.  Finally, I decided to take the plunge and buy this camera because it had an optical and digital zoom.  Since then, when we travel, my pictures come out better than our 35mm camera.<br />I have been at festivals and haven't been able to see because of large crowds.  I have been able to move the lens barrel down and hold the camera up in the air and still get my shot even when I can't see it myself.<br />I love the color of the pictures.  I love the simplicity of my camera and the complexity if I choose, and I especially love how I can take pictures at night.<br />I have recommended this camera to every one I know.  I have not been disappointed with it and I haven't missed using a 35mm camera.  I don't plan on looking for any other camera for a long time.","I did my homework for 3 months for a digitnal camera under $800 before I finally decided to purchase this one. Frankly I hesitated at first because most F717 pictures I viewed on websites looked kind of flat and the color was less saturated. I was WRONG. I found out that I can control the contrast and color saturation on a photo editor program (I use free Microsoft Photo Editor, which comes with Windows XP). I am also impressed with the overall body design. You may question what is good about the lens barrel moving up and down. You will find that feature convenient when you hold the camera up above the head; when you take a close-up picture; even when you shoot at eye-level.<br />As to the features, the camera allows a whole range of operation from fully automatic to complete manual. Most people would be happy with fully atomatic or programmed automatic, but as they avance in the skills they will appreciate the manual operation features. I personally would love to meet the people responsible for designing this camera, and shake hands with them to say \"Thank you!\"","this camera is very good. a best type of it's category","Pro:<br />* Preforms well in low light even without a flash.<br />*  5x optical zoom<br />*  The ability to manually focus<br />*  Controls easy to navigate<br />* Excellent picture quality<br />* Special settings such as sepia<br />* Three burst mode for action or hard to capture shots (Beware of long write time before you can take pictures again if you are using a high resolution setting)<br /><br />* Manual control of white balance allows for color correction<br />* The battery life is really good (however if you plan a long day of picture taking an extra battery is essential)<br />* Ability to manually set shutter and / or aperture<br />Cons:<br />* On high resolution can take a while to write to<br />* Bulky compared to a lot of other digital cameras (but not so much so when compared to a good 35mm)<br />* Memory sticks have historically cost more than other digital cards but I find that prices have come down significantly<br />* Sony really should ship this camera with a 128MB memory stick.  The 32 it comes with captures only a few pictures at a high resolution.<br />Things I would recommend to get along with the camera<br />* Extra memory sticks.<br />* Memory stick case<br />* A UV filter.  You don't need to get the one that Sony makes for the camera.  Any 58mm-thread filter will work.<br />* Tripod<br />* Sony's shutter remote<br />* A Neoprene camera strap<br />* Extra batteries<br />This is a great camera and I would recomend it even over the 827.","I base my purchases on what I require and REVIEWS, so I hope this is helpful...First if you are like me this camera is in your top three choices (and it should be) Five Megapixels is a minimum, not an option for printing out 5x7's or 8x10's, if you are looking at anything under five then quit. Buy a Canon i860 printer and Adobe Photo Shop Elements and you need little else.<br />Get a 256mb Pro Card or a 512mb Pro...shoots faster, get a MonoPod...this has a large lens and is steady on a monopod, makes it easy to carry. Why SONY?...Huge battery capacity/Highest Quality Lens/Zoom...I can shoot all weekend and not have to recharge...shooting in the highest quality mode...why buy a 5mgpixel if you shoot low res?  This camera has THE longest telephoto lens for the money and the highest quality lens.<br />Resolution and picture quality is amazing...flesh tones are excellent...USB straight to the computer...plug this into your front port and the pictures are sent automatically to your hard drive...if you can, get an external Hard Drive and keep all your photos on it...you can take it with you to share photos with family.  This Camera is Sooo much better than my 2meg Fuji...Night Vision is a very cool option, this camera has complete Manual control as well, good for photography classes for the Kids, Way more than a point and shoot but can be used that way if you wish. The Zoom lens is something I use ALL the time, didnt think I would but you start lovin it...I have shot over a thousand pics with no trouble. If you can afford a SONY Tripod then get one! You can control the camera from the handle of the Tripod! shoot/zoom/pan all from the handle...Sony knows what they are doing...If you just cant deal with a camera that is this big, then get the DSCV1...it has the High quality optics in a smaller package...I have recomended this camera to all my friends and family...I'm buying the 8meg version as soon as I can!","When I say amateur photographer, I mean someone who wants a little more control in their photo composition than someone who prefers a 'point and shoot' model.  While you can let this camera pick all the settings for you, I love being able to work through trial and error, finding the right settings for a picture.  I learned a lot of photography basics in high school, and I wanted to pick up a model with which I could put my education into use.  I have the filters, and picked up the Sony telephoto and wide angle lens for a steal.  While I've made good use of all of them, over time I've found that I don't really need all these accessories as much as I thought I would.  The zoom on the camera works very well.  I even took a picture of the Missisippi riverbank from the 29th floor of my office building a quarter-mile away, and the pictures came out fantastic, with incredible detail.  The 8 x 10's I print out come out fantastic.  A lot of people have asked me when I'm going to devote my time to this professionally after seeing my portfolio.  I think it takes a good eye to come up with great pictures, but great equipment doesn't hurt either.  I'm not sorry at all that I stopped using film.","Look just to sum it all up for you, short and simple, If you are into just taking alot of pictures for fun, this is a great SONY product. I had it now for a few months, and taken plenty of photos. The options are simple, and very strait forward. I am quite happy with what it is giving me. I got the filters for the lens and it helps a little. But it is realy heavy (heavier than anything I had before), but well worth it. It could be a drag to take on trips ( I don't mind). I haven't tried alot of digital cameras before, but this one has changed my mind, I will never go back to a regular camera ever again.","I purchased this camera not too long after it became available on the market, so have it about a year. I made some 3500 images with it, and generally I'm pretty satisfied with it.<br />There are situations which F717 handles nicely; there are moments where it lacks...<br />The lens is generally excellent, the design and built quality very good, battery life excellent-plus. The camera is fairly light, and ergonomically well thought out. You can read very detailed F717 reviews around the web, so I will not bother with describing the features. If you want good quality images without much effort on your side, usable for screen display, web or medium size printing up to some 8.5x11\", and for very reasonable price, buy it.  If you expect more then this, get either one of more sophisticated (and much pricier), high-quality digital SLR's, or stick with film, preferably medium format or bigger.<br />I bough F717 with high expectation, and while I still like it, it's not a camera which could compete with anything except 35mm film-based SLR's (I don't think any consumer or semi-pro digital camera really can anyway). I use it as documentary tool where it really excels due to instant results, but for more serious work I returned to film shooting. As the main result of f717 purchase, I almost abandoned 35mm film format, but work with MF/LF instead.<br />Finally, I don't regret buying F717. Would I buy it again?  Yes, I would; particularly at current discounted market price. I'm not planning to purchase new F828, since F717 most likely offers very close to what new model has to offer. Few pixels here and there won't make any significant difference.","After having an old film SLR for years (won't say how many), I resisted going digital.  When I finally decided it was time (new baby) I thought I would have to go with a digital SLR.  A friend loaned me the DSCF717, and I was relieved to see that the quality was as good as I was used to with film, even on the 8x10+ enlargements we do of baby portraits.  The real plus is that my husband is able to use this when set to auto.  (He never mastered the controls of our old Nikon.)<br />You can add on lens accessories to expand capabilities, and the price is so far below entry digital SLR's that you can really afford to splurge on those goodies.  (Especially extra memory, battery and car charger.)<br />Many reviews mention the awkward size, but I have not found it to be a bother at all.  I hardly ever took the zoom off my old camera, so this feels normal to me.","I am a semi professional digital photographer. Although my experience in digital cameras is not terribly great, yet, I needed something which would give me a lot possibilities as my abilities grew.<br />Working with computer games development I need this camera to take high resolution shots for textures, as well as provide me with movie clips for rotoscoping when animating.<br />I absolutely love this camera. I keep finding new and useful features, and I imagine that will continue for quite a while. The battery is almost impossible to run down, so it is perfect for gathering reference materials on longer outings. The lens is top notch and gives you picture quality second to none in this price range.<br />Five stars from me for a product without any things to really bother you.","Well, I must admit that one of the main reasons I bought this camera to begin with was its cools looks, in addition to the sturdy feel and build of it. (We call it \"Big Papa.\") Beyond that, it has proven itself to be quite a nice camera with plenty of features and excellent quality shots. The hologram lasers that shoot out to ensure proper focus are also a hit when showing it off to people.<br />My only real complaints are that the size and shape occasionally becomes annoying, and the auto-focus is off more frequently than my two-year-old, three-megapixel camera. That bugs at times, so take multiple shots when you can.<br />Overall: highly recommended.","Altough I had the opportunity to buy this camera's Big Brother, the DSC828 for just $100 more, I went with this tried and true classic and I haven't been sorry. Virtually all reports place this camera in the top 10% in terms of image quality and it has generally lived up to its billing. Saying that, I have a few points that I think are worth bearing in mind.<br />1) Sony continues to do an injustice to its customers by  continuing to put low-capacity memory sticks in its high-end digital cameras. If you buy this camera, you will need to budget another $75+ for more memory after spending $700+ on a camera. Shame on you Sony.<br />2) If you are using the Automatic mode, you simply MUST HAVE an external Flash. This, or any digital camera, will give poor results in low-light conditions. The built-in flash is far too harsh for all practical purposes. Consider Sony's own model, the Sunpak 383 or any flash that can be tipped to bounce off the ceiling. The improvement in the quality of your shots by using an external flash will stun you.<br />3) If you are used to working a Camcorder, you will be underwhelmed by a 5X zoom, altough it is not bad by industry standards. Spending $200 for Sony's add-on tele lens to power it to 10X seems like overkill.<br />In short, this is a four-star camera out of the box. It takes $200-$400 in extra gizmos to bring it close to the 5-star level.","The first thing people say when they see my camera is that it's so big.  They ask lots of questions - is it an SLR, what is the zoom (optical v/s digital).<br />Then, when they see the results this awesome camera produces - excellent pictures with awesome color and wonderful resolution - they are just floored.<br />I have shot at least 10 times more pictures than I usually shoot with a film-camera 'cause once you splurge the $625 for this camera, you're not paying another dime more.  Buy this and thank me for the rest of your life.  Sony really knows how to keep their customers happy with easy-to-use, well thought-out products.  I love my new toy!!!","Had this camera for several months and I still love it. It takes great pictures and has many useful features (once I figured them all out). Due to the low video resolution, I have not found the video mode to be very useful. Its a camera, not a video camera, so I dont see that as a negative. Printed pictures look wonderful, even when printed at larger sizes.","With the Sony 828 coming out in January, the 717 may soon be a relic. But at this time it is hands down the finest digital camera in the Sony line and strong competitor in the $750-1,000 range.<br />I've only given this camera 4 stars primarily because the price is misleading. For all practical purposes you can not operate a camera like this with the small Memory Stick provided by Sony. You'll need to upgrade to at least 128 or preferably 256MB or you'll spend more time downloading files than taking photos. So tack another $100 onto you bill. Also consider a UV filter to protect that protruding (and thus vunerable) lens (add $20).<br />PROS<br />- overall outstanding image quality<br />- best-in class low-light photos (helpful at Xmas!)<br />- optional manual controls and hot shoe add flexibility<br />- Burst \"feature\" allows three essentially simultaneous shots.<br />- surprisingly quiet<br />- decent battery life<br />CONS<br />- bulky<br />- zoom is ergonomically difficult to get used to. Practice before a big event!<br />Also check out the Minolta Dimage and the Nikon Coolpix 5700 --- comparable cameras with a lot to offer and have a more traditional SLR feel. I ultimately chose the Sony because reviews showed it outperforming the others in low-light, a situation I find myself in frequently.","This camera is simple one of the best on market. You are receiving a lot of options, a great color and good pictures with low ligth. I used it for my vacations on Spain and it was just perfect for any situation. The best is what you get for what you pay. if you are looking a good camera this is the one.","We've had the Sony DSC-F707 for over a year and love it.  I had a chance recently to test drive the newer F717 and was suitably impressed.  The features and use are nearly identical to the 707, as is the performance.  One difference is price - the 717 reatils for $100 less than our 707 did.  And, if you shop around, you can easily get a free 128 MB memory stick thrown in, maybe a case too.<br />On the test stand, the two cameras measured virtually identically.  That's a tribute to the dependability and quality, considering the thousands of images I've acquired with the 707, in a wide variety of demanding conditions, such as high altitude winter mountain photography and hot, dusty shoots in the desert.  This camera makes the A list for consumer digital cameras and if you can afford it, you'll be a happy camper.  One of the major challenges in consumer digital is the optics and the 5x optical zoom Zeiss optics are excellent.  The electronics of the 717 seem a tiny bit faster than on our 707, but both have less lag than most 5 MB models I've compared (over 30 onto the test bench in the last 3 months).  This baby is a keeper.","A very good camera to consider when moving from analog SLRs to digital photography.<br />Pros:<br />- Excellent picture quality and color balance<br />- Fast auto focus operation<br />- Very good viewfinder resolution<br />- Comprehensive information on viewfinder/LCD screen<br />- Excellent battery life<br />- Very good performance in \"shutter-speed-priority\" and \"aperture-priority\" modes.<br />- Very good low-light behaviour<br />- Better than average flash operation<br />Cons:<br />- Camera weight is out of balance<br />- Expensive memory sticks<br />- No soft case included in the package<br />- Larger capacity memory stick should be included in the package (instead of the 32MB stick currently accompanying the camera)<br />- User's manual is poorly designed.","My husband bought this camera right after our wedding in March of this year, and so far we've take over a 1000 pictures.  Every single picture has turned out great, even the unfocused ones!  The camera is quite versatile - it allows for autofocus and a great range of zoom, and it also allows for manual focusing with the whole fstop contraption, for ultra focused targets.  The color is excellent, and it remains one of our best buys in the last couple of years.  At first I was concerned over the size, as it is quite a bit larger than the slim digital cameras that are so popular today.  However, he carried it everywhere we went, and it really won me over.  This camera really is worth it's weight, and the price though high, is justified.  If you are in the market for a high-quality professional style camera, look at this model!  We've even started critiquing the photos from our reception, and wish our photographer had used a camera as good as ours.  Check it out!","Pros: Excellent quality. Exceptional feature list.<br />Cons: Not good as your first digital camera. It is big and heavy.<br />No matter what this camera will give you an excellent picture quality.<br />If you don't mind the size...It is one of the best cameras on the market.","Wow, what a great camera!  I spent quite a lot of time looking at digital cameras before investing in this one.  I've always had SLRs and I've had my own darkroom before, so this was a step in the other direction.  The camera itself is a little bulky and the lens makes it a bit cumbersome, but it more than makes up for this with the zoom ability and picture quality- it's the perfect camera for outdoor and wildlife enthusiast because of the amazing lens.  It makes you look like a professional photographer.  It takes great indoor shots, too, and is very true to color.<br />There are so many functions, you really have to try it out at home with the instruction manual for a bit before going out or you'll end up frustrated.  Once you get a feel for all the buttons and functions,  it gives you even more creative control then even a good SLR would, plus the video function is great (I got a few great videos that are a couple seconds apiece that I took on a whale watch of the whales surfacing) and the night shot is a lot of fun to play with.  I've done some beautiful pictures of the moon and I'm planning on buying an attachment so I can hook the camera up to a telescope and take some astronomy photos.<br />The battery will last for days, which is great if you're on vacation (I haven't had it run out yet).  The only gripe I have is about the memory cards.  The one it comes with is a joke and will last you all of ten minutes before it's full.  I have bought 3 separate 128mb memory cards, which will get me through a week of vacation away from any sort of computer where I can load them up.  Then I have to start going through and sacrificing photos that I took to make more room.  The memory cards are small and seemingly delicate and a tad difficult to change.  I don't think I would be able to do it at night or in the winter with cold hands.  Returning to my old ways, I keep the extra memory cards in a plastic film canister, which keeps them safe.  When you see the picture quality, it's worth the struggle.","This camera goes with me everywhere I go.  I am a Service Tech for Appliance Repair I use it to record what I find on the Job and to get those special shots out on the open road.  I have not had any problems It is a Great Camera Trouble Free I have Owned it since May 2003","The camera is the best.Period. The picture's quality is absolutelly stunning, the lens are unbelievable, the filters from Sony are the best etc. I print many of 8x10 and they as good as any of my prints from medium format 645 Fuji camera, even better. The picture quality is BETTER than 6m Nikon 10d.<br />Very smart camera. It works perfectly with my nice PowerMac machine. I'm very happy with all that. I really recomend to get the genuine Sony filters, they are perfect.","Frankly, this IS an investment...you spending [$$$] for this camera plus some needed accessories. Few people will ever shoot 5 Mega Pixels (MP) shots every time, but serious (and serious amateur) photographers will certainly appreciate being able to produce stunning detail when the need arises. Look at images shot on your friends' 2 or 3 MP cameras...this level of quality is amazing...but you WILL want to exceed this occasionally, and (...) is the price you pay to get the technology NOW. A 5 MP head shot will allow you to EASILY discern individual hairs on life-size prints (as in 11x14)...it's truely amazing.<br />I looked at the Minolta Dimage 7...the auto focus zooms past the subject and back...it seems irritatiingly \"loose\", for lack of a better term. The Sony is a bit crisper in it's approach to auto focus, though not perfect.<br />The Fuji camera does not have the same zoom & expansion capabilities. It's an overgrown pocket camera.<br />The Sony will handle weddings, public events, and function very much like a professional film camera.<br />Low-light shots are a challenge, but the viewfinder does have a tremendous amount of information available, including exposure \"F\" stops, shutter speed, low light warnings, etc. The true genius is that you can essentially operate the camera in a manual mode, quickly overriding the meter to compensate for the light in any situation...backlight, contrasty light, reflections, etc.<br />The 717 has some moderate metering improvments over the previous 707. Most major functions are the same.<br />If you ever used a 35mm in manual in the old days (when you really had to KNOW photography), you'll love the control available. And younger photographers will find a whole new world in being able to make this camera do what most digitals will still not do...take the unusual shot.<br />The camera is well balanced, and rather sturdy. You will get used to the shooting position...give it time. My biggest complaint is that the zoom selection switch operates \"backwards\" to my taste. Intuitively, I want to zoom \"in\" pressing the \"out\" button (!)...<br />You have an adequate built-in pop-up flash...PLUS a PC connection for external flash AND a flash shoe! Slavery, anyone?<br />The memory stick is a bit of a hassle, but extremely convenient once you get over the struggle. There are now numerous varities of portable USB readers. I* carry the Sony Floppy Disc reader and the Lexar USB reader. And buy the 128 MB memory stick...nothing smaller. The newer 256 sitcks require you flip them over but they ar even better bargains.<br />A friend with this same camera recenlty pointed out that we should all be shooting at the highest possible resolution. You can always reduce the resolution later on the computer. Don't miss that shot of a lifetime.<br />The images are good, but I do have to compensate a bit in low-light. Based on shooting several thousand \"test\" shots with another camera, I'm happy with this one. It does the job and can satisfy both consumer and professional. Note that I do not plan to replace this camera for several years. Why? Because printer technology has not caught up to the resolution of the camera (at least for the home user) and no one really needs much more in a camera. Five Mega Pixels will generate a poster-size image with very nice quality...you won't be doing it often, but you'll be glad you did when you do.<br />I like it, and I shopped hard to ensure the most features with the best price. As with all electronics, find a cheap extended warranty. (...) . Cameras DO break.<br />Shop carefully for a CASE to put it in...the unique shape requires some thinking. I have 3. One for everything including cords and cables, one for the camera plus memory sticks, and a Sony brand \"ever-ready\" case. Depends on how long you're out and how fast you want to access the camera..at what level of protection. Think.<br />You'll want an extra battery. Perhaps a travel charger, otherwise you charge the battery by plugging the CAMERA in the wall (!)...thanks Sony. :-(<br />Buy a UV filter (58mm) to protect the lens.<br />This camera is expensive, and generally reliable - it's a Sony. Many features I have not detailed, and it has a superb 10x OPTICAL zoom (and a 2x digital). If you are thinking digital and want to not have to trade-up for a while, I suggest the Sony DSC-F707. If you love photography, do not buy a smaller CCD chip than 5 MP...even if you buy another brand. But I certainly recommend the Sony DSC-F717 camera for people to whom the image is important.","This is the first digital camera I've actually preferred over my standard film camera.  In fact, so much so, I'm selling my old gear in favor of the digital here.<br />The control I have is amazing, as this camera is so much more than point and shoot.<br />The Sony intelligent battery system is awesome, and enhances the camera's value.  It comes with the FM50 M series battery, which provides up to 4 hours of continuous power, depending on usage.  But I found it also accepts a FM31 series battery, which is the exact size of the FM50, but has a 30% less power capacity.  (The FM31 comes with many of the Sony HandyCam devices, which also means the charger/AC adaptor can be used on both.  An elegant solution if you want to interchange batteries and adaptors.)<br />The lens system is first-rate, and provides clear distortion-free pictures.  The lens also tilts on the camera body, enabling those over-the-head shots common to public arenas, and while keeping a clear view of the LCD viewfinder.  Use 58mm screw-on lens accessories.<br />Memory Stick Pro is also a good investment with this camera, and even the smallest one of these will provide nearly 100 shots at full resolution, and several hundred snapshots at the lower resolutions.<br />DPOF is also supported, if you can find a lab that actually supports it.","In short;<br />Great photos<br />Take total control or let the camera do the thinking<br />A great camera, you will be the envy of your friends, especially if you get a dye-sub printer! (DPP EX5)<br />Only Two bad things;<br />1. Electronic View Finder grainy<br />2. Supplied Memory Stick (32MB)!  It will take a while to write a high res pic to the stick and only take 2 or 3 pics at highest resolution, 12 highest res JPEG.  Get a larger Pro model Mem stick!","I like this camera very well, but in the several months I've owned it I did uncover a few minor weaknesses that detract from my original perception of it as a dream camera. Here's my list of pros & cons. POSITIVES: (1) Upload of photos is incredibly easy, compared to Sony's TRV-140 camcorder, which the saleslady never should have sold me. Do not use Pixela. It's garbage, and with this camera you don't need it at all. (2) Colors are beautiful. I couldn't believe the colors in my first photos of iridescent seashells! That's why I still bought Sony instead of Nikon, despite my earlier troubles with a Sony camcorder. This Carl Zeiss lens is supposed to be better than a Nikon lens. (3) Portrait mode creates the narrow depth of field effect that I like. (4) An entire memory stick of photos can be quickly deleted at once, instead of one at a time. (5) Macro mode allows very close-up (2 cm distant) pictures using the same lens. (6) Viewfinder-to-LCD display switch is quite useful. (7) Lens cap included. (8) The hot shoe allows an external flash, which is supposed to be the only sure way to get rid of red-eye. (9) This 5 megapixel resolution will produce quality 8\"x10\" prints with an unpixelated appearance--any camera with a lower resolution will not do this. (10) The ability of the camera body to tilt almost 90 degrees upward from the lens is outstanding for catching candid people pictures from your lap. (11) The white balance features are extremely useful for indoor photos. If you haven't played with those yet, do so! NEGATIVES: (1) Another lousy Sony manual. The manual doesn't mention that the exposure button must be reenabled after each photo before the jog dial will function. It doesn't say why the macro icon disappears when the camera is switched to manual focus. The troubleshooting guide never caught my first real problem: everything was blurred at all times, and only after much experimentation did I discover that the finder adjustment dial had accidentally gotten rotated. The 3-pronged icon that keeps popping up automatically is not explained anywhere that I can find. Many terms are not listed in the rear index. (2) Auto exposure often gives an ugly, grayish tint to the pictures. I use manual exposure almost exclusively now because of that. (3) Macro mode is tricky and counterintuitive. One must zoom *out* before being able to get macro shots, and then there are problems when focusing around the 0.9 meter range, which unfortunately is the distance of most museum exhibits and flowers. (4) The flanges on the hot shoe constantly snag on the interior netted pocket on my Sony carrying case. They should have been rounded off. (5) Too many automatic features that are annoying, like the flash unit that scared the hell out of me the first time it automatically popped out of the side of the lens, the pretty music that plays upon powering up the camera that alerts animals and people that you're about to snap their photo, and the added complexity of unnecessary video capability and special effects. (6) Similarly, all this complexity and having to traverse electronic menus discourages me from changing settings often, with the result that I often end up using an inappropriate mode for some shots. (7) Red laser beams that shoot out of the lens when taking photos in dim lighting, which alert people that their photo is about to be taken. RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) Get an ultraviolet lens immediately to protect this expensive lens. UV lenses are only about $10-15, have no discernable visual effect, and screw on easily. (2) Use 128 MB memory sticks or higher. With the resolution I use, I can get 90 pictures per memory stick, which is quite good. SUMMARY: So far I haven't found any flaws serious enough to make me want a different camera, and I'm quite pleased with all the positive aspects. This camera is used by some pros selling photos on the Internet and it's certainly the best camera I've owned so far. You can buy a 6 megapixel camera, but if so you're going to double the price for that extra 1 mp, and unless you're making unusually large prints, that extra resolution will be useless. And all the attention and comments I get with this camera are fun: \"Now *there's* a camera!\" \"That's quite a lens you got on that camera.\" \"That lens is bigger than the camera!\" \"How do you like your camera?\" \"Excuse me, can I ask you about your camera?\"","Having been an owner of the Sony F505V, the upgrade to the F717 was a natural progression.<br />As one gets more aquainted with digital photography, one will certainly come to appreciate MORE megapixels! I've been eyeing a 14mp camera, but it's [price] ... so, the Sony is far better suited to my preferred \"sensible\" price:value ratio.<br />I started life as a true-blue \"film\" photographer. I tried a first generation digital camera (it was much less than 1 mp), and although it was fun... it just wasn't ready for prime time. Later, I jumped for the Kodak DC 120 (1mp)... this was a far better camera, but not so good for real photography work. Then, came the Sony F505V (3.3MP)... it was true love! However, as my own appreciation for the digital medium grew, I soon found that it was not quite suitable for the photo purist that I had been. Then, came the F717!!!<br />The F717 is the most film-like of any digital I've ever used. The features are many... but being Sony, the costs tend to be high. One can take complete control over exposure, time, or let the camera maximize things for you automatically. One fun feature is the ability to play back a slide show to a TV/VCR (with the supplied cable)...this is particularly nifty when shooting family gatherings!  :-)<br />The pivot body style makes it far more versatile than comperable competitor cameras (quite suitable for getting MORE angles on a subject).<br />Battery life is great, picture quality is outstanding, the additional modes for night and special FX make it even better. Rumor has it that if one purchases/locates an appropriate infrared filter and uses the \"night shot\" during the day, that one can get a slight x-ray effect in the photos. I have yet to try this, but I'm intrigued by the possibilty.<br />The shape itself can be a burden if one looks to store it in a traditional camera bag (might as well break down and get one of the Sony bags!)<br />The ONLY real drawback that I've experienced with the camera is that one will want at LEAST 128mb memory sticks to use with this camera (it comes with a 32mb, which is a joke). The Lexar memory sticks tend to be more cost effective, but if you're out and about and decide to do video (yes, it does decent video too...although it is NOT a video camera)... doing video will fill up your precious memory sticks REALLY fast! Sony has since announced a 1gb memory stick, but the current price is close to the cost of the camera...  Sorry, I'll just buy more 128mb Lexar's until the price comes down!  :)<br />Although I'm a big fan of Nikon, Olympus and such in the film world, Sony rules the day in the 5mp digital world.<br />Would I buy again?  In a heart beat!<br />PS- Don't look for any real \"support\" from Sony. Do a Google search and find some newsgroups/user groups out there. However, the lack of support is not a Sony exclusive, and it does seem to be the nature of the marketplace (seems everyone has had to make budget cuts...\"support\" is just another victim).","I have now used the camera for a whole of 3 months and have shot close to 1000 pictures and have bought 3 books on photography and digital photography. I had previously bought a DSC-F707 and lost it.  I did not have any hesitation in picking up the successor to the DSC-F707 again!<br />Not having been an interested photographer in the past, I think that the above fact speaks volumes for how good the camera is and how cost effective it is over film (this is true for most digital cameras) and how interested it can get you to start photographing. I can vouch for this fact because, a friend who picked up another one of these beauties is doing pretty much the same.<br />This camera has an effective 5 Meg pixels and knows how to use them. The pictures are absolutely razor sharp. This does not mean that you cannot take soft portrait. With a lot of manual settings at your disposal you can get the picture just the way you want it.<br />Now, the lens. Oh! What a lens. This is a lens which if various reviews and friends whose hobby is photography are to be believed would cost atleast 2 to 3 grand to get film SLR equivalents. Think about it! You get an aperture of 2.0 at a 5x zoom at full wide angle. That is a really fast lens. To go with it does extremely well in low light conditions as well! The auto focus is not the fastest but for most shots you do not even notice it.<br />Now the controls, full aperture control (from f/2 to f/8) and full shutter control from 1/1000 (1/2000 in programmed AE mode)sec to 30 secs gives you enough freedom to capture the most unusual shots! White balance options are adequate, you get to choose between 5 auto, sunny, cloudy, incandescent, fluoroscent. If none of these are close enough, you have a one-touch white balance. But this requires that you have a white object exposed to the same light that the object you want to photograph is exposed to. Not always feasible for landscapes in tricky light conditions or for people and portraits outside or in mixed lighting. Even though to be fair, the auto does a pretty good job of calculating white balance. Auto Exposure Lock and a choice of 3 metering modes allow you to adjust exposure to any part of the photo and shoot images with consistent exposure plus the option to choose the focusing segment makes it very versatile. This is very important if you want to stitch landscapes together. Also, you have the option of either manually focussing if need be. Pretty good versatility.<br />Other good stuff: Flash is really very good, night shot framing is very handy, battery performance, the histogram for live and review of shots, etc.,<br />Strengths:<br />1) Carl Ziess lens.<br />2) 5 meg pixels.<br />3) Low light photography.<br />4) Price - Performance ratio.<br />5) Flash<br />6) Battery life and info<br />7) Level of manual controls<br />8) Great tripod mount positioning<br />9) Histogram that shows exposure graphically while live or on review.<br />10) Compatibility with Memory stick pro media. (Upto 1G size).<br />Weaknesses:<br />1) Price of the memory sticks in comparison to other digital media.<br />2) In camera battery charging<br />3) Bundled software","This may be a funny-looking camera, but it is a gem of a performer. Its Zeiss lens is tack sharp, its electronics do all of the thinking for you, and the results are superb. You should get the optional lens hood, as the glass is very close to the front of the lens barrel. And if you plan to do much shooting at one time, plan to get a memory stick pro with a lot of memory (I use 4 128mb sticks, and wish I had bought a 512 mb stick instead). If you get a chance to shoot someone else's and look at your results, you'll buy your own, I guarantee. It is not as large as it looks in the picture, and it is relatively light in weight and easy to carry at your side. This camera is a winner.","I've spent a good deal of time with my 3.2 megapixel Olympus and thought that it was a pretty good camera.  That is until I bought the Sony F717.  The good things...Looong battery life with fairly quick charging..... accurate autofocus, even at macro setttings...controls/menus are obvious, you don't even need the manual to figure most of it out...fast cycling...great through the lens or screen readouts and framing, a focus ring that feels like the thing is on a real camera...intuitive location of controls, after ~15 minutes of fooling with it I could shoot and never take my eyes off of the viewfinder despite changing aperture, speed, flash, macro etc frequently.<br />The bad things...the manual is a great quick get-started guide but lacks the detail I'd like in a camera with this much potential that costs this much.  The software that comes with the camera is not great, but if you spend this much on a camera you ought to use Photoshop or PictureIt any way.","My wife finally let me upgrade from my 707, so now we have one 717 and one 707 and go out shooting at least once a week. I love this camera, it is almost everything I hoped for as an upgrade from the 707.<br />It is much faster than the 707, though still weak with action shots.  You can nail predictable events like a bird in flight, but when wild dolphins come up to your sailboat, expect to miss two out of three shots.  If you do need to shoot action, hit menu and one of the record modes is \"burst 3\" three rapid shots one after another, you might get lucky that way.<br />The \"A\" and \"S\" and settings to enhance depth of field and shutter speed do not seem to give good results. Likewise, The new scene selections (twilight, landscape and portrait) seem limited, though I have had some fun with portrait when I am dealing with a messy background.  However, for best results, I just leave it on the green camera icon, that seems to perform the best.  One BIG problem though, the camera is only two months old and all the markings have worn off the mode dial making it hard to set up in a hurry, shame on Sony for that!<br />The 717 shoots well in intense light situations, the beach at 1 PM is no problem, except that the light is harsh, if you are going to shoot in snow or at the beach, think about getting the lens hood and ND filter accessories.<br />We dropped $500.00 or so on the Sony wide angle lens, that was a mistake, it weighs so much it appears to hurt the camera and like all wide angles, eats light.  On the bright side, there is less distortion than I have ever seen in a WA.<br />The 717 doesn't handle subtle transparent sky light, a muted sunset, or rainbow can be lost. I still haven't scored a double rainbow with a digital, I can see both, the cameras can only see one of them.<br />They have moved some of the control buttons from the 707 positions; moving zoom was a mistake, it really is better to have the zoom control as the farthest out control on the lens so you can find it without taking your eyes off your subject.  On the plus side the focus switch is in a deeper indent, this keeps you from switching into manual mode accidentally.<br />The auto popup flash is really noisy and vigorous and it has caused me to miss a few shots as it slams into place.  Red eye reduction as usual doesn't work so well, but that is why God invented photoshop.<br />Moving to some of the really positive features:<br />The macro mode for closeups is a marvel. I need to do some tripod scientific tests, but it seems like the 707 out performs the 717 in macro.  But we are still nailing great closeups of dew on flowers and the like and the 717's speed lets you freeze a bee on a flower or a hummingbird.<br />The way it handles light on water is just spectacular. It can also handle shooting the sky through trees and similar shots that confound simple cameras.<br />Like the 707, the combination of movable lens and ability to work with finder or lcd screen really gives you flexability when shooting things taller than you are. I got a \"Senators Only\" parking sign on Parliament Hill Ottawa that was about 8' up by holding the camera above my head and aiming through the lcd.  I was trying to get a shot of a wierd bug face to face the other day so I laid the lens on the floor, and turned the finder screen to face me.  Love it!<br />The range of the zoom is all you can ask of a single lens, yes you do lose a bit of resolution at full digital zoom, but it can still nail a seaplane landing in Vancouver harbor and has enough pixels left to print a nice 8.5 x 11.<br />It interfaces with both my Mac 10.2 and Windows XP Pro with no problem in either case. The XP software is actually a bit more efficient than iPhoto.<br />I will close with some final tips:<br />My wife got me this little nylon Ex Officio bag to tie to the strap. That is a much more efficient in an active shoot than the memory stick wallet.<br />If the subject moves, as soon as you start framing, teach yourself to push the shutter button half way down, that cuts a lot of the delay out of a shot.<br />Don't buy a memory stick less than 128M, I think my wife's 707 came with a 16M, now *that* is funny.<br />If you have never tried one of these web based photo storage and printers like Amazon.com's photo services or Image station, they are great for situations like shooting a family reunion. Just send the URL to everyone and they can order all the prints they want. Remember the days of looking for the negative with picture 5 on roll 9? I love my 717 and I am never going back to film.","I purchased the F717 as the replacement for my 4meg camera.  I had the opportunity to shoot quite a bit with the Sony, a Nikon 5700, and the Minolta 7i, and after comparing the images side by side, I bought the Sony.  The images are very even in color balance, the saturation is excellent and the resolution is outstanding for a camera in this price range.  The image quality is so clearly better than the others that the choice was simple, even considering the memory stick storage capacity limitation, which is not long a problem, with the recent announcement of higher capacity sticks being available this spring from both Sony and Sandisk. I'm purchasing the Sony wide angle lens this week, it's the only additional necessity I'll need.  This is my camera until I can justify the Canon EOS D1s....","I bought this camara about three weeks ago and I love it. It took a few days to figure out all of the features. I was having some problems with the exposure while taking action shots in the gym using the shutter priority mode....pic's where dark....I called sony support and within 5 minutes I had the solution...tried it and it worked. The picture quality is awesome. This is my second digital and by far the best. This camara does not limit you to just point and shoot which is the best feature. I bought the wide angle lens took some awesome scenic shots. The night shot is another great feature. You may not use all of the features right away but when you master the basics it allows you to grow and try new techniques.","The only thing that I don't like is being limited to 128 meg memory sticks. I like taking pictures at high resolutions and that eats memory sticks fast!<br />I have heard a rumor that 1 gig sticks will be available within a month. That should be plenty of room for most people. (until you can dump everyting into your computer's hard drive)<br />I love all the maual options this camera provides. It takes beautiful, in focus, pictures in complete darkness. With a shutter speed from 1/1000 to 30 seconds you have the abilty to take great action shots and night shots!!!!<br />The only thing that I would suggest for improvment would be making it smaller. I'm sure they are already working on it!!!","I studied long and hard before spending so much on a camera, and my time paid off. This camera is comfortable to use, easy to learn and with a bit of time, to master, and produces great results. Excellent color, and the unique night-focus and night-shot features work as advertised. Not cheap, but worth it for the serious amateur digital photographer. Wouldn't embarass a pro, either.","AFTER GOING THROUGH LOT OF SEARCH I FINALLY DECIDED TO BUY F717 TO FULFIL MY DREAMS REGARDING DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY WITH THE DECENT AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARD CAMERA.IT IS NICE COMBINATION OF SIMPLE AND ADVANCE OPERATIONS.THE BEGINNERS COULD USE THE AUTOFOCUS MODE AND THE OTHER PEOPLE COULD DO ALOT WITH THE FEATURES OF THIS CAMERA.<br />FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DONOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE CAMERAS AND PHOTOGRAPHY THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR THEM. ANYONE WHO IS INTO PHOTOGRAPHY THIS IS A VERY GOOD CAMERA.","I spent a lot of time getting up to speed on this camera.  Although it takes extremely good pictures and would be great for a pro, it is not for me.  You have to use both hands for most pics. The zoom feature is on the left side of the bulky lens, for instance, while the shutter release is on the r/h front side of the camera, making zooming in and focusing a tiresome task.  It has too many features that you pay for, but which are not easy to learn to use. In fact, most of them  you would probably never even use if you were a family man just taking pictures of family activities.  I took it back after owning it for a week & exchanged it. However, If you are a true camera nut or a pro, stick to the DSC- F717.  It really is great, it has a great many pro features not found on less expensive cameras.","The DSC-F717 is a dummy-proof camera with semi-pro intentions.  In comparison with various Canon digital and analog cameras that I have owned, the ease of use is comparable to the digitals, and the features comparable to the canon SLRs.  The bulky 2-handed design makes it more difficult to capture spontaneous moments, even when compared to the SLR, and the prominence of the button provides very good tactile control, but after a while, the direction pad starts to feel fragile. The bulkiness of the 717 has made me consider a second purchase of the new autofocus cybershot U-20 for all those other occasions where the speed of \"deholstering\" is important to capture those spontaneous moments.  If only the could make a U-20 with all the features of the 717!","Ok, maybe that's an exagerration... it's on the nightstand. Actually this is a great camera. It's not a top of the line professional, but it's not supposed to be either. This means you can't swap out the lens but you can add to it. The Carl Zeiss lens is, however, an amazing part of this camera. I took a quick snapshot of a crescent moon, and on my computer was able to see craters, so the zoom isn't that bad...<br />This thing also connected instantly to my Mac (OS X - Jaguar), so I love that. I edit with PhotoShop, so I didn't bother to see what software came with the package.<br />let's see... pros - great lens, fairly lightweight, easy to use.<br />cons - took a little time to figure out some of the features, wasn't impressed with the manual. other than that, it's the best camera I own.<br />--------------------<br />Ok, it's been six months since I first wrote a review of the Sony F717...  And it's still an awesome camera.  my only gripe was the size of the memory stick that comes with it, but I've since gotten a few 128 sticks.<br />I've really become quite fond of the manual settings, allows for some really fantastic shots while playing with depth of field.<br />The Macro settings also have come in handy with some spectacular results, very sharp images of tiny things close up to the lens.<br />Still happy with the zoom, got me close enough to an alligator without having to offer myself up as lunch!<br />Despite the bulkiness of the shape, your hands can easily get accustomed to it, and soon you'll be shooting without worry.  The plus side of this design is that in forcing you to use both hands (for most shots) you'll end up with steadier shots.<br />Another plus is the threading on the lens, which let's you add filters (first one you should get is a UV filter - around [$$$] at most camera shops).  My favorite is my polarizer, it has saved many a shot.<br />I've since bought a pocket tripod (Ultrapod II), and combined, I am quite happy.  Overall, I have to say this is still the best camera I've owned.","This camera is amazing!! I started with the 505, and then moved up to the 707. If you're like me, you have a love for photography, but not necessarily the skill for it.<br />This camera handles all the details for you, so it's literally point and click. The features are more than abundant, and the quality is beyond belief.<br />I recommend getting the 128mb Memory Stick (maybe two if your going on a long vacation) and the Memory Stick USB reader for your PC.<br />You will not be dissapointed!","I'll keep this short since there are already several reviews on this product.<br />The good side: plenty of options and bottom line: nice picture quality.  I am totally in love with the manual zoom ring.  Matter of fact, at times, I forget that the \"T/W\" button existed at all(LOL) since I use the manual zoom ring so often.  The manual zoom ring provides more delicate and linear zoom capability, whereas, the \"T/W\" button can be \"choppy\" as you are trying to adjust the zoom.  I also love the new MPEG HQX movie option.  It lasts longer than the 707's and the resolution quality is pretty decent to my surprise.  Sound isn't the best, but hey, it's a DSC.  The improvements over the 707 are definitely worth the extra $200.<br />The bad (minor): Manual focus.  It's hard to judge if the picture is \"in focus\" because the view in the LCD is a bit too grainy.  So I thought the view finder would be a better option to use.  But, it too, is a bit too grainy to make a good judgement.  Therefore, I avoid manual focus altogether.  I find that it takes quite a bit of trial and error to get the right focus-I just don't have the patience for that.  There were times where I thought I had the picture in focus, but to my dismay, after seeing it in my computer, it is not.  However, I think in the user's manual, it did state that the manual focus should generally be used in low light conditions or when autofocus is having difficulty finding the correct focus.  I just wish the picture quality in both the LCD and view finder could be improved somehow-at least so that a better judgement in focus can be made.  It seems the LCS/View finder needs to be more WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get-for those who didn't know the acronym).  Yeah, I agree that the lens housing is a bit too long, making the entire camera kinda bulky.  I also find because of its shape and size, there are very few non-Sony cases that fit it just right.  Would be nice of Sony to have the \"official\" leather case come with the camera package-oh well.<br />The fact that this is all the negatives I can dish out on this camera should speak for itself.","You can't go wrong with bying this camera from Amazon. If you have ever moved to advanced photography and used 35 mm SLRs such as Minolta Maxxum 5000 or 7000 then you will love this Cybershot Cameras. Both models 707 and 717 are almost the same. They both future all advanced settings of SLRs and an excellent Zeiss zoom lens with focal length 9.7mm to 48.5mm. Keep in mind that because formed digital image size is different than a frame size 24mm x 36mm of regular film corresponding Lens 35mm is equivalent to 38-190mm. Camera is very easy to operate and all controls are intuitive and logically placed. You will find shutter priority, aperture priority, auto, and of course full manual mode including manual focusing. As soon as I bought this camera I took it for a \"test drive\" to the racing dogs track...If you own a Sony camcorder you will be pleasantly surprised that menu navigation and setup functions are very similar. In addition, you will find that your Sony's camcorder and Cybershot power supplies for battery charging are the same so you don't have to carry two of them when you are taking a trip. Finally, Cybershot lets you record mpeg movies limited in time only to the capacity of the memory stick. Some other cameras limit your movie clips to 30 or 60 sec.","I just received this camera on friday and I have not been able to stop playing with it.  This camera offers great quality at a reasonable price.  The 32mb card is a bit of a joke, so I recomend purchasing a 128mb stick when you get the camera.<br />The pros.<br />With the 32mb card at the 640 X 480 resolution you can take hundreds of pictures. The camera evens tells you how many more pictures you can take with the current resolution. And it had a metter to show you how much of the memory stick you have left.<br />Also the hologram focus allows you to get a perfect picture almost every time.  What happens is the camera emits this cross hatch pattern on the subject for a split second to allow the camera to focus at 5 different points giving your pictures the utmost clarity.<br />The night shot and night framing are a wonderful additon.  With the night shot you can literally take pictures in complete darkness.  The only down side to this is that your pictures have a green hue and it makes a person look like a ghost. But thats not an issue with night framing.  With night framing you can still take pictures in a no-light situation, but the picture comes out as if you took it in broad daylight.<br />The movie mode.  The sound quality isn't the best, but hey its a camera not a camcorder.  With the 128mb card and the resolution set to the second highest(i can't remember the exact resolution) you can take a 25 min movie.  Not to shabby for a mainly still camera.<br />Ease of use is not even a concern with in 5 minutes of powering the camera on I was able to do more than take simple pictures.  I was able to play with the picture effects (sepia, neg. art, solorize) and several of the other features with out having to look at the owners manual(which is very nice and detailed).  The only other effect that I wish it had but doesn't is Balck and white that would have completed the picture effects (for me at least).<br />The software provided is a breeze.  Once installed it does all the work for you.  I have WIN XP PRO and WIN 2K and the camera had NO problems interfacing with either OS.  All you have to do is plug the camera in to the USB port and Image Transfer automatically copies the pictures over for you.<br />Cons:<br />I do wish it did have a better zoom, sometimes its hard to get pictures that are far away, but you can get a telephoto lense for this.<br />Other than the one con the camera is great.  Battery time is amazing on a little over 2 hour charge you get 4 solid hours of continuous shooting.  Of course no one does that, but on one charge I took over 600 pictures and still had over half the battery.  Of course most of the pictures were random since I was playing with the functions.<br />Any one looking for a wonderful camera to last them a long, long time will definately want to check this one out.  I also bought the stamina pack from sony, but I haven't recieved that yet.  This comes with a lens filter to prevent too much light from overwhelming the camera, an extra battery, and a soft carrying case.<br />Over all great camera."]},{"name":"Kodak EasyShare CX4200","amazon_reviews":["great camera","This isn't a bad camera just make sure that you get rechargable batteries.  If not you will be replacing the batteries alot.","I've had this camera for 4 years now and its definately showing its age. Many cell phone cameras on the market now have a higher resolution than this thing. But for a simple point and shoot camera it does its job pretty well if you don't plan on printing anything larger than a 4x6 or cropping at all.<br /><br />The build quality is pretty good... I've dropped this thing numerous times, and while the plastic casing has cracked because of the fall the interior still funtions like it's  new. Listen to other reviewers when they say this thing eats batteries. The most I can take with newly recharged batteries is probably about 30 pictures without flash. Another con is that it takes very poor pictures in low light. The picture becomes pretty grainy.<br /><br />This was a good buy at $99 in 2003, but is probably barely worth half that now.","I have a feedback of almost 1000.  I bought this camera for the main purpose of ebay way back in 2000 or 2001 and have used it every single day since until this very moment. 2 MP is perfect for those listings on ebay.  Absolutely NO problems with this camera at all !<br /><br />There is definitly a 1 second delay between pressing the capture button and the shutter actually \"catching\" the picture which makes taking pictures of fast motion real bad.","I really like this camera.  Although it is only 2MP, I find the photos are excellent quality and still print out on a photo printer as clear and good as a normal photo.  It is also very easy to use, very much a point and click camera.  The menus on the camera are easy to find and adjust anything if you need to.  That is takes short videos is great too, this feature has saved me from spending hundreds on a video camera then having to lug that and this one around.  The docking station is by far my favourite feature though -just plonk it on the cradle, press a button and all the photos download -easy!<br /><br />This is highly recommended, I don't see any point spending more when you get this excellent camera for such a good price.","This camera has served me well since January 2003 when I first bought it. Since then I have taken over 7,000 pictures and I am so glad it's still going. I plan on getting a new camera, but only because technology is improving so rapidly. This camera has been wonderful and survived many drops, hits, stratches and throws.

I must admit there are some annoying features, the 16mb internal memory is worthless for instance, offering storage for only 20 photos. The LCD screen on the back is too small, not very good for reviewing pictures, and when using the (slow) internal memory, the picures in review mode take a few seconds to sharpen up. The internal memory is also painfully slow when taking pictures, with an annoying, long wait in between pictures. However, the camera becomes a different thing all together with a high performance SD memory card installed, offering better reviewing, picture taking and transfer speed to the computer. The picture quality is very good for a budget digital, colors are vivid, detail good. I find it doesnt perform very well in low light conditions however (like all digital cameras) and you must be careful to press the shutter button halfway down before taking pics, or risk over/under exposure. However, all cheap digicams share these problems, and i find the quality of the pics very good, i find this camera easy to use. With good quality Nimh batteries, it gives a reasonable shooting time in daylight, althought the flash reduces the battery life greatly. I also find the flash a bit too powerful at close range, although I'm sure that power would come in handy when illuminating a dark area from a long distance. All in all, this is good and I prefer the simplicity of the design, I even like the lack of zoom. The lack of zoom also increases the battery life. If you want a fancy camera, get a DSLR, if u just want to snap family pics, the CX4200 is a bargain, especially at the hugely dicounted prices I have seen lately. (they are obiously running the model out)","The good:  No learning curve; solid image quality; light and compact<br /><br />The bad:  No optical zoom; no scene modes; no manual controls except exposure compensation; no movie mode; hard-to-use buttons; small LCD; relatively short battery life; slow recycle time; shutter lag; included software uses lots of RAM; now discontinued<br /><br />Who's it for:  Novices who want the simplest to use camera available with pleasing photos in a compact package.<br /><br />What's it for:  Everyday snapshooting.<br /><br />The bottom line:  Novices will love this camera's extreme simplicity, low price tag and vivid photos. But since the only manually controllable part is exposure compensation, if this isn't your first digital camera you should definetely look elsewhere.","I have had the camera for about a year now and I love it! Numerous amounts of times I have developed pictures taken with this camera and they come out great! The software is the easiest thing in the world to use. For the price, it is definately a great buy.","I bought our CX4200 back in March. We've taken hundreds of photos and are well pleased with it. It's easy to use and the software gave us no problem at all. But the most truly amazing thing about our camera is this - we live in Ohio and visited Dawes Arboretum (a magnificent place) and I accidentally dropped our camera. It hit the ground, rolled down an incline, went off the incline into the lake where it became totally submerged. I jumped in after it and it was dead as a doornail. We removed the Kodak memory card and the batteries, hoping to use them in a different camera. Today, four days after the dunking incident, I put the batteries and the card back in, turned it on and it's working again, just as good as new. The pictures transferred as well as they ever did, and all the camera's functions are working. This camera was under water - it had water inside it, water in the battery compartment, water in the dock connector, water in the viewfinder and fogging up the LCD. A camera repairman offered little hope for it but today, this little camera is alive and well and taking photos. Don't try this with your camera! Just know that Kodak make a quality product, despite what may be said to the contrary.","This was my first digital camera, and I was happily snapping pictures 5 minutes out of the box. Menu system is very easy to use, though the controls to do so lack fine control, and you may wind up trying a couple times to select on option, but that's a very minor complaint! The images are fine for email, but as with other reviewers -- printing them out in any size is an exercise in frustration. They're simply not good printed, but for 2mg pixels how much can you ask for? I found the color to be extremely true to life, the flash *more* than adequate for casual pictures, and so far it has handled surprising extremes of lighting very well.<br />Cons? The camera sucks battery life like a starving vampire! CRV3 batteries are the only thing with any life at all, but at $10 a pop for those, you'll want to be very conscious about turning the camera off when not using it. Do NOT use AA - you'll go through 60 pounds of them inside a week, and camera performance suffers.<br />Do NOT buy the dock! It's outrageously expensive, and you can transfer pictures with the USB cable provided. The dock is a waste of mnoney.<br />I recommend this camera because it's the best value for the money spent for a name brand camera at the beginner level. However, if you take a lot of pictures, or want more control - ie filtering, zoom, movies etc -- then you should spend more and move up the pixel ladder to a 4mp. But be prepared to spend *several* hundred more to do so!","I just downloaded my 3000th picture off my camera and I really like it.  In hindsight I wish I had paid some extra and got the optical zoom but that is just me.  The pictures are clear the color is bright in all but the most extreme conditions.  It was easy to use and with the purchase of a $5 camera bag, it has stood up well.  I recommend some Nickel Hydrate batteries to go with it.  It takes around 300 pictures on a pair of freshly recharged batteries for me.  I haven't printed much off as I prefer to post them online on one of the many free photo sites but the few I have, I have been happy with their performance.","All you have to do is play with this camera for a few minutes and you'll get the picture.--Kodak is still the standard!","This is amongst \"THE GREATEST GIFTS\"  I received this year!  I love it, it's simple you don't have to be an expert to use this camera, and everything is ONE TOUCH!  It's a great price and since I've gotten it pictures have been a cinch to get to relatives over seas, or just across the street!  Anyone looking to make a wise investment, and love to take photos as much as I do I would recommend the purchase of this camera.......","A previous review made a false claim regarding the flash.  If you turn it off, it will stay off (or whatever you set it to) until you turn the camera off and turn it back on again.  the default setting is always auto.<br />As for the quality, I think the camera is well-made, but perhaps some aspects of the design are lacking: the battery door opens very easily if you rest your fingers on it while holding the camera; the SD slot door clicks closed nicely, but the hinge is flimsy; the directional pad is hard to press in the middle (for the OK button) without also pressing one of the arrows at the same time.  An annoying flaw is that the camera has trouble taking more than 2 pictures in quick succession.  After that the camera takes several seconds to be photo ready again.<br />The same reviewer was accused by another reviewer from Seattle of being a racist based on the comment implying that everything made in China is cheap in quality.  ...Being half-Chinese myself, I don't think there was anything wrong with the first reviewer's statement. Most of the stuff made in China IS cheap in quality. They're getting better, but it's practically a fact of modern life that \"made in china\" = significant probability of low quality.<br />Back to the camera: This is not a professional camera nor anywhere close to it. Diagonal lines, for example, are often pixellated even on highest quality (when viewed at actual size).  that said, the quality of the photos is plenty adequate for simple photography, and its close-up photos (use the switch, take photo from range of 1') are top-quality--they are the best type of photo it takes.<br />the 2X digital zoom is pretty worthless, since it degrades the quality of the picture.<br />the camera gets very good battery life on 1800mah NiMH rechargeables.<br />when indoors and not using the flash, you either need to hold the camera extremely steady or decrease the exposure time, otherwise the picture will be blurred.<br />If all you want to do is have a digital camera for basic use, i.e., simple family photos, sightseeing, etc., buy this camera.  And if you happen to sell a few things online every now and then as I do, this camera is more than adequate for close-up product-photos, unless you need photos at a range of less than 6 inches.  If you're looking for a camera for amatuer photography or anything more sophisticated, you might want a 3MP with a zoom at least.","...the batteries don't last at all!!<br />Ni-MH batts are a little hard to find here, and it says on the user's guide \"do not use alkaline batteries\". and so i did, only i had to replace them 3 times before i could get the camera to take one single picture - and then that was it.<br />i tried using alkaline batteries instead, and funnily enough, they lasted way longer. the Ni-MH batts really do last even longer than regular alkalines, but still not long enough. so i HAD to buy a set of rechargeable batts, and a recharger.<br />on a brighter note, the camera takes great quality pics and is very easy to use.","Quote:<br />'VERY cheap looking and feeling. Every time I flip a switch I'm afraid I'm going to break something.  Typical \"Made in China\" quality.'<br />-A customer from USA, June 28<br />I don't think that these reviews are meant for discriminatory comments such as that.  I consider that reviewer a racist bigot and hope that his review doesn't influence your purchase.<br />I received this camera for Christmas last year and have been very satisfied with it.  It satisfactorily fills the needs of most casual users.  The camera is very well made considering it isn't a high end model.  The picture quality is excellent.<br />The only problem is the battery life.  I can't seem to take very many pictures before the battery indicator turns on.  There is a very simple solution to this, however.  You only need to purchase some rechargeable NiMH batteries.  Overall, it's a great purchase.","Easy to use, easy to carry, great picture quality.<br />I bought mine with a 64 MB expansion.  A must... Take as many pictures a you like and later choose what you want to keep.<br />I print my pictures on an EPSON Stylus Photo 870.  Can't tell the difference from regular \"developed\" photos at 4 x 6\".<br />I don't give it 5 stars just because of the lack of optical zoom.","I was looking for a very inexpensive camera to take pictures to use online.  This seems to fit the bill.  I don't have the docking station; it's not needed to get pictures from the camera to your PC.  Considering it's 50% of the price of the camera, it doesn't seem to make sense.<br />The downside is that there are a lot of annoying little things about the camera:<br />- VERY cheap looking and feeling.  Every time I flip a switch I'm afraid I'm going to break something.  Typical \"Made in China\" quality.<br />- Batteries don't last at all.  Don't even consider using disposable batteries in this camera.  Get some NiMH rechargeables when you buy the camera.<br />- Battery status meter only has three levels:  0, 10, and 100%.  And there's no way to actually check your current battery status.  When you hit 10%, the indicator comes on, and you have only a couple of pictures left till the batteries die.<br />- LCD is practially unusable outdoors, even on overcast days.  When you're reviewing the picture you just took, you get a basic idea of what's in the picture, but you can't tell if it's properly focused or exposed.<br />- If you turn the flash off, it stays off only for the next picture, then turns itself back on.<br />- The camera can't automatically use both its internal memory and the memory card at the same time.  The \"Auto\" setting means to save pictures in the memory card if present; when you have a memory card installed and are using Auto mode, when the card fills up, you must manually switch to Internal mode to use the internal memory.","I knew nothing about digital cameras before I bought this.  I really just wanted something to take quickie pictures that I can use online. This is perfect for that.  It's simple, easy to use, and the pictures turn out well for the price you pay.  I am extremely satisfied.  This camera is not for the serious photographer.  You'll need a mre expensive, flashier model for that. But but if you are looking to make good pics for web pages and e-mails quickly, I don't think you can do any better than this.","This is my first digital camera. I know there are hundreds of digital cameras for sale but I settled on this one from a beginners point of view. My budget was limited, my knowledge of digital photography was limited, and my experience with Kodak has always been pleasant. I've not been disappointed with this camera. I bought it with the intentions of taking vacation photos and snapshots. It does the job well.<br />If you don't plan to make enlargements, only print standard sized photos, this 2MP camera is great. You will need lots of batteries though and a battery charger. Also plan on buying an extra memory card or two if you plan to take lots of photos. The internal memory is only equal to \"one roll of film\".<br />I recommend that you purchase a supply of rechargeable batteries and a battery charger. These digital cameras eat batteries at a alarming pace. You will want at least eight batteries. I took pictures in the daytime during vacation and charged up the batteries each evening. Don't leave the display screen on any more than you have to. It wastes the battery power in no time.<br />Also you will want to buy extra memory for this camera. The 32MB internal memory was really not sufficient enough for my use. I bought a 256MB SD memory card and even at the highest resolution I can now get 10 times the number of pictures as before.<br />The Easyshare software is easy to use but it's sort of hoggish unless you have tons of space on your computer's hard drive. I loaded the software and then realized that I already had everything \"I\" needed on my computer so promptly deleted the Kodak Easyshare software. You may want to keep it running. It has lots of nice features. I just didn't need all it's 'bells and whistles'. My camera came with an older Easyshare software version. If yours does that too you can always download the latest version from the Kodak.com web site.<br />The instruction booklet is small but it contains tons of information. Read it. Those few buttons on the back of the camera are misleading. They are all multi-functional. I wish they'd included a wallet sized \"cheat card\". I made one for myself to tuck into my pocket. My memory needs an upgrade too, ha!<br />You can download your pictures directly from the camera into your computer. It's really painless. I haven't tried printing pictures yet from a Kodak kiosk so I can't comment on that. I've only printed some on my printer and sent some as email attachments.<br />So far I've been very pleased with the camera. It's wonderful not to have to buy film all the time. I love being able to take a picture, load it onto my hard drive and email it right away. No more waiting for the film to be developed. No more waiting extra days for the photo lab to put my pictures on disk or CD.","This is my first digital camera.  I am going out of the country to visit family next month, and I plan on taking a lot of pictures, but I didn't want to lug around boxes and boxes of film (I need to save all the suitcase space for clothes and whatnot).  I also didn't want to spend a lot of money on the camera, just in case I lose it, as I often tend to lose things.  For the price, I am so far very pleased.  Not to mention I got the money towards a memory card, so I was able to get 64 MB card for just a few dollars.<br />Even though this is the first I have purchased, I am semi-familiar with digital cameras from high school and college courses and friends, so I somewhat knew what I was doing, but I think that this camera would be easy for even the least knowledgeable person.  I opened up the package, put the batteries in, and started taking pictures.  I have yet to look at the instruction manual! The one thing that I was a little disappointed about was the battery usage, but I'll get over it.  I plan on buying the lithium batts.  I had the camera on for about an hour and already the batts were on their last leg.  But in their defense, I had the live feed on, and was trying it out on my TV, computer, etc.  I'm sure that it'll be just fine when I just have it on to take the pictures.<br />I was also surprised about the quality of the pictures.  I have emailed some to my family, and they're excellent!  Plus, the software that was included is easy to use and install.  All in all, this is probably the smartest investment I have made in a while!!<br />I will say that the shutter has to be held down for a second in order to take the picture, which is okay, but I have an 8 month old and it's impossible to get him to be still that long! And also, the buttons are a little punchy.  Sometimes just pressing them once clicks them twice or you have to click them twice just to work, but all in all, it's a solid camera, especially for the casual picture taker.","I received the camera today, and the size of it just amazed me. It is very small (even though this oculd be tricky, because you could lose it or break it in an easier way). The quality of the pictures seems OK on the LCD. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to download them from the cam, because the cable seems to be the wrong size. I'll probably solve this problem, but the first impression wasn't the best, and that's why I took a star out of my review. With all the features the cam has, it was really a bargain.","This is the perfect camera to start with in the digital world real user friendy . And for the price well worth it i just wish it had a higher zoom level but for the price just perfect","I recieved my camera today and 5 minutes later I was taking pictures. I have never owned a digital camera and this product is so easy to use its amazing. So far so good. For the price is a great buy.","This camera is easy to use and is good quality for the price.  However, one disadvantage is that it does not have a zoom lens.  Also, what you see through the viewfinder is a little different then how the picture ends up; the final picture has extra space on the right that you don't see when looking in the viewfinder, so be sure to keep that in mind when trying to center a picture.","I was just venturing in to the world of digital photography, the new computer was packaged with a digital camera, but I was not able to take decent picutres.  Agonizing with a friend, I was telling him, I just didn't think digital photography was for me.<br />He recommended this camera to me, and I would in turn, highly recommend it to anyone else with basic photography needs.  It takes great pictures, they are easy to download, print and edit.<br />I would recommend the dock, the cost savings in batteries will make up for itself in short time.  Using the dock, there is only one button to push to upload your pictures directly to your hard drive.<br />The camera is small and light weight.  It easily fits into your pocket  The internal memory does not hold a lot of picures, but with a 64mb card, I have capability of taking close to 200 picures using a lower resolution.  Even using the lower resolution, the pictures are very good.","Great camera for the price. All the advice I heard was \"don't go below 3mp.\" My budget was small, so I decided to take the risk anyway. The resolution on the camera viewing screen isn't all that great, but I have printed off a lot of pictures, all sizes and they have turned out wonderful! Great camera for the casual picture taker.","I just got this camera from Amazon.  At first, I was nervous.  The camera is very small and light -- it felt... cheap.  I loaded up the software (Windows 98) without a problem.  I was able to take pics the first day, upload them, edit them, and email them.  The pictures were really quite good -- I wouldn't consider paying hundreds for more expensive cameras -- it's not worth it.  The free 32 MB card (offer from Amazon which might have expired) lets me take about 35 pics at the best quality.<br /> Cons: the LCD screen is really pretty small and the editing software is really basic.  But it lets you email people right away and sends them at low resolution so your friends won't have to download gigantic files when they open your email.<br />I am mostly pleased so far.  I did not want to spend big $ and I feel I definitely got my money's worth -- $... for the camera and the free 32 MB secure digital card.  Also -- I was able to connect to my TV and view pics there without a problem.<br />Kodak EasyShare is definitely Easy.  I don't have a Dock and won't buy one -- that's just unnecessary.<br />This is a very good First Camera to buy for those on a budget but want pics that look clean, crisp, and that are easy to take/edit/email.","Compact, light, and does it all.  About the only thing about it that I don't like is that it takes a second or two from button-press to capture -- which makes it hard to catch a moment sometimes.  But otherwise it's a great camera.  Good battery life, nice bright screen, and crisp big pictures.","This is a Fantastic Camera.<br />This is our first digital camera and we are very pleased with the simpleness of how to operate, e-mail, even print photo's.<br />Pictures are in Professional quality. I have a Lexmark Z22 and use Kodak Ultima Picture Paper and Office Depot Premium Selection Satin Gloss for Best Quality pictures. The thing I don't like is that it doesn't keep a list of Pics you send to whome, (unless I havn't figured it out yet). We HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS CAMERA even without a docking station. I can send 15 pics in one email, and we are taking pics of wildlife and they are fantastic. My 12yr. old had this camera figured out within 3 min and was able to print them within 15 min of installing software. THAT'S HOW EASY IT IS TO USE!!. We have looked around for other camera's and we liked this one the best. With the software you can edit your pics and for fun things you can even change the pics to colloring book and cartoons, crop and brighten or darken, shading or contrast. Printing Pics in different sizes like 8X10,5X7,portrait or landscape and other sizes.<br />Easy as 1,2,3. Instal software, take pictures, Print or Email.<br />Can't get any easier then that.","I got my camera a couple of days ago and I am Super Duper happy with it.  the pictures are excellent, And the battery consumption is not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. I've taken at least 60 pics(most with flash) with rechargeable NiMH 1800mAh batteries and eventhough the low battery indicator is flashing, it's still taking pictures(w/flash)....I definately recommend this camera to anyone!","Pros: Very easy to use, inexpensive, sturdy, Easy to use, lightweight, great pictures, video out, lcd and traditional viewfinders, Good exposure, compact, Easy download of pictures, good starter software.<br />Cons: No optical zoom, The extra \"dock\" costs you ..., but you don't really need it, small lcd, small internal memory, Zoom options are limited, Only 16 MG of internal memory, Secure Digital is the only memory upgrade avaliable, eats AA batteries like candy!!!<br />Summary: The pictures that I have downloaded and printed on my printer have been excellent quality. I even printed an 8X10 of my daughter and it turned out great. The images were not grainy as I had suspected they would be. I have read a lot of reviews that state the casual photographer should not need much more than a 2.0 mega-pixel camera. After printing pictures and having some printed by online retailers, I must say I am NOT disappointed. The colors seem true to life and I haven't seen much red-eye.<br />Transfering pictures to your computer is easy, even without the dock. Just connect your USB cable to the camera and your computer, turn on the Kodak easy share software and hit transfer. You can transfer all your pictures at once, one-by-one, or by date acquired. I transferred 8 pictures at once and it only took a few seconds. You can edit the pictures with the software, e-mail them or order online prints. I have it set up so that pictures automatically get stored in the \"my pictures\" file on my computer, but that really wasn't needed.<br />I think this is a very good camera for first timers and people that are on a limited budget. A must Want List!!","I got this camera about three weeks ago, and so far it works great. I haven't used it heavily, but what pictures I've taken have come out great on the computer. The pictures are surprisingly detailed, colorful, and smooth. I originally wanted a DX3400 (4300?) because I wanted finely detailed pictures, but the price was way too high for my budget. I'm glad I decided to go for this one, though, because honestly, I don't think I would have been able to tell a difference between the pictures from this camera and the DX. I also didn't expect the camera to be this small and light... My only gripes would have to be that the batteries exhaust themselves pretty quickly. After having taken about 30 pictures, the batteries that came with the camera are half gone. Also, there's a small delay between pressing the button and the actual picture being taken. All in all, though, the camera was a pretty good deal. ...","Being digital novices, we wanted our first camera to be easy to use, inexpensive, and give great photos. The Kodak CX4200 does all that. The Easyshare dock is just that - easy. No headaches, no problems, just easy transfer and high quality photos. No matter what format you prefer, from wallet-size to full page wallpaper for your computer, the pictures remain clear and crisp. I'm a die-hard 35mm film user, but I have to admit, this little \"snapshop\" digital does a great job...and without film!","The best part I like about this camera is that it is very easy to use. Taking photographs is fun with user friendly menu. I did not even pen the manual. I have taken several good photographs using this camera. Thge pictures were crystal clear at highest resolution. But if you are lookign for a camera which can zoom, then this camera is not for you. I take only point and shoot pictures most of the time and so its perfect for me.<br />Okay now I want to tell something about the part after you take the snaps. That is downloading. The software is so easy to use and when you plug in this camera the software automatically downloads all the pictures. Actually on my computer I can see the camera as a drive in windows explorer.<br />Things I dont like are low memory and low battery life. I recommend buying rechargeable batteries and 256 Mb compact flash card which is right now on sale in amazon.com.","Hey, I bought this cam this afternoon and I can allready say I am totaly impressed!! It takes great pics unlike my old dig cam this is like 1,000,000 times better. It's a MUST BUY!!","I got this camera for Christmas and I haven't put it down since then. It is one of the easiest things to learn how to use and is very user friendly. Downloading and emailing pictures is even easier than learning to use the camera. I recommend buying a set of Kodak rechargable batteries and a charger. It's not very expensive and it will pay off. So far I've had a lot of luck with this camera and have found that almost anyone can use it... even if you have no experience with this type of thing. The Kodak Easyshare software is great. Especially to enhance photos and completely get rid of red eye. I am very satisfied with this prduct and I hope that future buyers will take this into consideration.<br />~213","I received this camera as a gift.  I wanted a new digital camera since my last one had 640x480 res. and the pictures were not that great to say the least.  I have a new son and we were taking lots of pictures to email to family members.  I just love this camera.  The docking cradle is a must.  This camera has rechargeable batteries that charge in the docking cradle.  And the pictures tranfer at the touch of a button.  This is so much easier than the last camera I had.  The quality of the pictures is great, good exposure, the flash set to auto works well, not too bright.  The only negative thing I would have to say is the LCD screen does not work well in low light, but I have no problem dealing with that.  This is a good 2MP camera at a good price.  Definitely invest in the docking cradle to go with it.","...This camera is small and light. Just use 2 AA batteries.<br />The image quality is very good in best quality selection (\"***\").<br />And there is a cover to protect the len. Color is good(maybe this is not important, you can use photoshop to adjust your pictures). I like it. The batteries life is not bad. No other useless function such as movie mode. Great 2M Digital camera with a low price. Even I can choose chinese menu language."]},{"name":"Kodak DX4330","amazon_reviews":["Works as advertised by the seller.

I bought it just over 3 yrs ago after my youngest son was born. It is so easy to use, so much it can do. I did have 1 digital camera before this and to download the pictures I would spend a frustrating 30 minutes every time to get my computer to 'see' it. My husband doesn't like 'complicated' electronics but he will use this. Much to my joy I receive e-mailed pictures from him every couple of weeks (I am currently deployed to Iraq). Since being here a few other people have been interested in buying a digital camera and I HIGHLY recommended a Kodak Easyshare. I actually wish Kodak would start making digital video cameras. This is the next step for video and I would defiantly by one...","This is the easiest to use digital camera I have ever seen.  It has the ability to take movies, and even has different modes (auto, sports, macro, low-light, and ZOOM)... all without making it complicated.  That's why this camera is good for beginners and experienced users alike (enough options for many of us, but easy for the novices).  It has a 1.8inch viewable LCD.  I've found that the cams with bigger screens used up batteries to fast, and those with smaller screens just weren't big enough to see.  This camera has INTERNAL MEMORY.  A big plus because many digital cameras only rely on memory cards.  Also, you have the option of using SD memory cards if you want.  They're cheaper than SONY memory stick, more compact that Compact Flash cards, and are so versitile because it's the same size that fits into PDA's such as palm-pilots.  This makes it especially handy.  The flash is easy to use on this camera and isn't overpowerful like my last camera.  It's bright enough without drowning out the image with white flash.<br /><br />Only drawback is that the Dock is usually sold seperately.  I suggest you buy it bundled with the Dock (charges batteries) to save serious $$ on batteries.  You can also always use regular AA batteries in a pinch.","I am an aspiring photographer.  I received this camera as a gift and I like it quite a bit.  I've outgrown the camera and am upgrading to the Canon EOS 20D.  However, I highly reccommend this camera to beginners.  It takes AMAZING landscape photographs.  It's light, durable and fun.  This would be a good camera for families, as well.  I think it's the best camera for beginners.<br /><br />Some of its downfalls are:<br /><br />  - You cant take on the spot pictures.  It takes a second to capture the image.  My dog is notorious for turning his head just as I hit the button.  Henceforth, this makes it a bad camera for action shots.<br /><br />  - I do photography of a local band and this camera is not very good for photographing indoors in low light.<br /><br />  - The video funtion is pretty much useless, as the sound quality is horrible.<br /><br />  - The lens cap pops right off.<br /><br />I've had no problems otherwise and have had the camera for almost 2 years.  Again, I think this is a great camera.  I tried to upload my photography on here, but after spending all the time choosing them, writing captions and such, it had problems and didn't upload them.  I'd be happy to share some of them with anyone.  I have quite a few that I've made no adjustments to, so you can see how good the quality is.  Just drop me an email on here.","I had 3 digital cameras, that was the first one. I had also casio z40 and kodak ls743. I would never get rid of 4330, but I could not stand battery life.. I had 4 2000mah and I had to charge them all the time.. the other thing was size of this camera , kinda big, and that cover/cap..<br /><br />But the pictures was incerdibly good, colors were natural, super pix in low light.. I hope I find similar quality camera with diferent kind of battery .","I am very happy with this camera, or was until it began to go wrong, working for a short time then turning itself off just as I was about to take a picture despite using new batteries.<br /><br />Having been warned that repairs would cost a fortune, I was all ready to buy a new camera.  However a very charming young man in the camera shop cleaned up the contacts for me at no charge and now it works perfectly again.  I hope this information may be of use to someone else experiencing the same problem.","I purchased the camera over a year ago, and i have had a few minor problems.  First, it occasionally takes blurry pictures, even as i do my best to steady it in my hand.  That happens about every 10 shots.  Also, it doesnt work too well in long distance shots. Finally, one day it just stopped working.  I sent it back to Kodak and they notified me that it needed a new lense.  About $20 and 2 weeks later it was back, in perfect working condition.<br /><br />Other than that, i have been very happy with the DX4330.  It is a great camera.","Well...I've had this camera for nearly a year.  For the first 6 months, I had no problems whatsoever with it.  It's an easy to use, few features (compared to other cameras) to deal with, and takes good pictures.  I used the better setting to take pictures and they came out great.  That's a plus to this camera.<br />However, after 6 months or so, the camera started having its issues.  I had trouble keeping the camera on, and it would turn off when I would press the review button.  Nice feature to have right at your fingertips but pointless if the thing turns off and restarts every time you press it.  Then I had an issue with it not turning on at all.  I replaced the batteries, I put it on the docking station and it wouldn't turn on that way either.  I was pretty miffed at Disneyland when the camera wouldn't turn on.  Two days later however it resurrected itself...by this time I was home already and Disneyland was in the past.<br />Anyway, I sent the camera to be repaired...to some place in Connecticut...they returned the camera saying they had done a complete repair and restoration to factory specs.  No more than two weeks later, same problem occurred.  I pressed the review button and the camera turned itself off and on again.  Now it doesn't turn on at all...again.  So I called Kodak and I have to send it in for repair...again...I'd like my money back actually to buy a different brand.<br />Maybe it's just my camera, but be cautious with this one.  They're not selling them anymore anyway, but at one point the LCD display had interesting colored vertical lines across it.  I also had to reformat my SD card at obviously one of the worst times to do so...lost a lot of good pictures that way.  My suggestion, despite the good pics, buy a different brand or a better Kodak model.","I am a happy owner of this camera model. It has everything you need. It takes pictures almost automatic, it has a good zoom, many options in the menu, sharing capabilities, and so on.<br />The resolution is more that great!  But if you want to take pictures at a high resolution, you are going to need an extra memory card. I have a 256Mb MMC and it can store more than 300 pictures at the highest resolution.<br />The image quality from the pictures is very good.  I have printed like 100 pictures (using an online service) and the quality of the printed pictures is even better than a film camera.<br />The only issue I've found in this model is that in the night, there's a green led next to the viewfinder which makes visibility through the viewfinder very hard.  Sometimes you have to take pictures using a good sense of positioning because the viewfinder will be completely unhelpful.<br />Another drawback in this model is the self-timer.  It has only one option (on/off) sometimes I'd like to have more options like (number of pictures, time to wait, etc.).<br />The camera don't have any effect in the menu, but come on, this is still digital so you can make the effects with the software included.  But this mean that you are going to need software if you are thinking in making some funny picture effects.<br />And finally, after buying this camera, you'll have to think seriosly about buying rechargable batteries.  You are really going to need them when you are traveling and need to take several pictures.","As a teacher, I take a lot of pictures of my students.  I have a classroom website and like to put pictures of various outings and activities on it to share with families.  I did a lot of research because I wanted something that would be durable and easy to use at school but also satisfy my need for a good, affordable, convenient camera for my family.  This had everything I was looking for wrapped up in one camera and it has lived up to every expectation!  I have used it to take video, put up pictures on a website, taken pictures of my family & students, share pictures/video through email, and printed pictures that I have taken with this camera.  None of them have disappointed me.  The only thing that has frustrated me a bit has nothing to do with the camera, but with the software that comes with it.  It is a bit archaic and does not always function correctly.  And some key features were left off of the software such as a \"select all\" option when wanting to view many pictures in a row.  But other than that, you cannot go wrong with this camera!","I purchased this camera about two months ago.  After browsing through the user manual & playing with the camera a bit the first night, I quickly had the key functions figured out.  This camera is very easy to use...the function dials & buttons are clearly marked & easy to figure out.  I did struggle to get some clear shots of close-up items at first, however once you figure out how to auto-focus before snapping your picture (simply press the shutter button down halfway to focus then press all the way to snap the picture) everything comes out crystal clear.  The process of uploading images from the camera to the computer is simple, & the functions in the photo program that allow you to manipulate the images (crop, reduce red-eye, rotate, etc.) are easy to use.<br />In addition to the camera being easy to operate, I was excited to see that the quality of the photos taken with it are excellent! I have had several friends tell me how impressed they were with the picture quality when I e-mailed them some of my first few pictures.  So far I have not purchased the docking station, a memory card or any other accessories for my camera - only rechargeable batteries.  I have found that I can take over 30 pictures using the internal camera memory before it is full & has to be uploaded to the computer so more pictures can be taken.  I plan to buy a memory card eventually because 30 pictures won't get me far when I'm on vacation & am unable to upload the pictures off of the camera, but for now it works great for home use.<br />Excellent digital camera - I would definitely recommend it! Although I have used digital cameras before at work, this is the first one I've owned.  So far I am very pleased with my choice!","we wanted to buy a digital for the nascar race we go to every yr here in indianapolis,let me tell you ,I was impressed.my hubby took great caution shot photos with this camera.all the photos were great! this was our first digital and I love it!I was worried because its not a 1000 dollar camera but we have gotten our money's worth and then some..I have taken lots and lots of photos,we bought a 128mb kodak sd card and that little thing can save up to 200 or more pictures.I get good prints from my printer.well I like it,if you are new at digital and don't need nothing printed at more than 11x14 then go for it..","This was my first digital camera purchase.  I have been very pleased with the camera.  It takes wonderful pictures.  I found the software easy to use.  I would recommend getting a battery charger.  I do not have the camera dock, so I do not know how well the camera works with the dock.  I connect the camera to my PC using the USB cable and have not had any problems.","At first I didn't know anything about Digital Cameras. My father's company gave him his camera for work. It's the same camera I own now. I love the camera! It has a sharp image and I love the up close feature it comes with (the little flower icon) it's great for taking up close images! I have the Kodak Card reader instead of the loading dock and it works nicely.<br />And the really nice deal is if you get your picture developed they only cost .29 cents per picture at Wal-Mart for the one-hour developing. Great deal! I just can't say enough about this camera! I enjoy it and try to use it whenever I can.","This camera takes great photos, especially outside.  I had a shot blown up to 8X10, and I could hardly tell that it wasn't a film photo.  However, I found the camera fragile, Kodak customer service unfriendly, and the lens cap annoying.  A small drop of the camera resulted in massive damage and a $$$ repair bill.  The lens cap is annoying because it relies on friction to stay in place, but the smooth surface of the lens mount causes it to fall off all the time, resulting in a dirty lens.  Buy the camera, but be careful with it.","I received this as a Christmas gift this past year and all I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!  I took more pictures and short video in two weeks than I had taken in two years with my old 35mm camera. It is a Minolta Maxium 5000, with a 35-85mm lens and a 70-200mm lens. This Kodak is the most like a \"real\" camera that I have seen in a digital format.  The macro mode and the sport modes are great. You can even get great 8x10's at the 2 mp setting. You won't be dissapointed with this camera, but I recomend you get at least a 128 mb secure digital card to go with it and take the pictures in at least to 2 mp mode because with all the pictures you will be taking you will want to print them out.  BUYS THIS CAMERA! and you WILL NOT be disapointed. One more thing get a good editing photo software I recomend Picture It Premium or Digital Pro,  very user friendy","I have recently bought this camera. Very easy to use. I am happy that I have not purchased the docking station. According to Kodak, by pressing a button on the docking station you can transfer your pictures to your computer. What I feel is that if you are too lazy to press that damn button on the docking station, just don't buy the docking station. After installing the software just connect your camera to your computer using the USB cable --- the software will automatically sense the camera and you can transfer all your pictures with a mouse-click! As far as charging the battery goes, I guess that you are better of using the non-rechargable CRV3 lithium battery (you will get one of this with the new camera). Just buy a few of them in advance from discount stores --- if you buy them at tourist spots, you can end up paying a lot more. The lithium battery has much longer life, and I don't think that you should worry about how docking station can help you recharge. One more tip --- register your camera and software to extend the standard 12 month warranty to 13 months!<br />I have bought it a month back and paid $$$ + sales tax for the new camera. This price beats what Circuit City or Best Buy offers. Shop online from reliable stores or check out smaller dealers willing to offer a nicer deal. 3 Mega Pixels, 3x optical zoom, user-friendliness, low price and the Kodak connection --- you will surely be happy with this camera!!! Of course, you need to be careful --- don't listen to anyone asking you to waste $$ on the docking station.<br />OK! I don't need to buy any more Kodak films :-)","I bought this camera for my wife a few months ago and she loves it! Actually, I meant WE love it! I bought it from Dell.com and used a number of stackable coupons plus free shipping. The final price we paid was $...! What's even greater is that it came with the Camera Dock II. So I think I got a pretty good deal, especially since every other local retail store was selling it for $... and $... additional for the camera dock, not to mention the tax. So we saved over $...<br />PROS: Great outdoor vivid colors, Resolution helps make fantastic 10 x 13 prints and perhaps a bit larger, Capable of making low resolution live captures for emailing only, Dock makes transferring images from camera to computer a snap, Dock also recharges batteries. Camera has expandable accessories (sold separately) including a digital smart card, wide angle, telephoto and close up lens. I have not used a lens yet but plan to get a close up lens to shoot my coin and baseball card collection. We plan to purchase a memory card also, but honestly, you don't need one. It can take up to 38 images with its internal memory.<br />CONS: Low illumination shots require a virtually motionless hand or using a tripod. Otherwise the images are not great and look slightly blurry. I use a tripod for this environment and the images are sharp.<br />OVERALL: This is a great camera, especially for the price I paid. Shop around and you too can get a great deal. The performance of the camera thus far is what we expected and more. We love the plug and play features of this camera  not to mention the great images we capture. We recommend you try Dell.com but first visit DealCatcher.com for coupon codes.","this camera is so easy to use, you don't need to go thru menu after menu, buttons after buttons. I also love the movie functions that i used a lot. the movie picture quality is so-so (sure, it's camera but for bloody sake) but movie picture does look pretty if you plug the camera on TV.<br />Problems:<br />the only problem i have with this camera is the battery life. I am surprised a couple folks said the battery life is not bad, but I think only the CRV battery coming with the camera lasts decent long enough, but other NiMH rechargables aren't last enough. so you may want to carry extra battery.<br />Overall, I still highly recommend this camera with highest rating.","love it.  only one problem- the instructions don't say much about how to email pics. pics are good and clear.","This was my first digital camera purchase. After reading so many reviews (and going to different shops like Best Buy to check out the cameras) I decided on this one. I was definitely not disappointed. Here are the main pros and cons:<br />Pros:<br />1) The 3.1M pixel resolution is more than adequate for a 5 x 7 (which is what my wife loves to print). We ordered prints from ofoto.com and they were superb! (seemed even better than prints from a 35mm).<br />2) The movie feature is also nice - it's done at a fixed low resolution and the output is in a quicktime movie format (.mov).<br />Cons:<br />1) The main drawback is the fact that you need to buy a separate battery charger. There are cheap ones available or you could get the relatively expensive Kodak camera dock like I did. The dock is convenient for charging and downloading images to the computer, bit I still think it's too expensive.<br />2) You also need to get rechargeable batteries since the ones that come with the camera are not rechargeable.<br />So overall, the camera is great, but you do have to factor in additional accessories like the rechargeable batteries and battery charger. Still, it's a great camera and I would highly recommend it.","The Kodak Easyshare DX4330, was my first digital camera purchase. I have always used regular cameras w/regular film that I wasted a lot of bad pictures & money on.<br />With this digital camera you can see how your picture turned out as soon as you take the picture! This camera is very easy to use once you know what each button and setting mean. You can zoom in 3 times and the quality of the picture on the camera is amazing.<br />You can just plug up the camera into your TV to watch a slideshow of your pictures or to watch a movie you have on it. You have six differnet options: Video, Auto, Sport, Night, Landscape, & Close Up.<br />This camera is a great digital camera. I just have two negative opinions about it that I didn't think it deserved a 5.<br />Using the camera dock to see your pictures on the computer reguarly messes up on me. It won't show the pictures no matter if I restart my computer or do anything to the camera. Also the video length is way too short. These may be stupid negative opinions but I know the camera is a great camera to own none the less.","My mother bought this camera and many of the suggested items as a present for my first mother's day.  The camera's fun and relatively easy to use; however, the additional items Amazon suggested to go with it (batteries and charger, memory card) were not only unnecessary, they were incompatible with the system.  I would recommend buying the camera first, then adding ordering accessories as you need/want them, making sure they are the products that work with this model of digital camera.","This is a simple camera that does a lot.  It's lightweight, takes pretty good pictures, has excellent storage and battery life.  I have had a lot of trouble with the software; sometimes it won't download, or it will take several tries until the pictures download.  This can be frustrating.  Kodak has been helpful and concerned but has not been able to do much about this.  Some cautions/advice: you do NOT need the docking cradle unless you really like rechargeable batteries.  The cradle takes up room and is no easier than the USB cable, in my opinion.  Also, you should ONLY take pictures in the \"Highest Quality\" setting; anything less can be grainy.  The camera cannot focus on moving objects, and the flash is only useful in quite close shots; for others in even soft light, it's best to set the camera on \"night\" or \"landscape,\" as another reviewer also advised.  Red-eye is chronic and the software has been of limited utility in correcting  them (and my son has bright blue eyes, which end up devilishly red every time). The memory cards are invaluable.  Get as much as you can on one card; there's no reason to get less than 128MB.  I took 175 pix on 2-64MB cards but was always worried about losing the full card.  The travel kit is very useful: I used the case as a purse while traveling (with the camera nestled inside) and it comes with all kinds of adapters that travelers need.  However, battery life is looooong: on a two week vacation on which I took 175 pix, I only used two (non-rechargeable) batteries.  Otherwise, the travel case is kind of big, so a smaller case would be useful and they are easy to find.  I bought a smaller case direct from Kodak.<br />Summary: great camera, great value, fussy software, excellent customer service, excellent accessories, skip the docking cradle.","This camera was my first digital camera purchase.  I've found it to be one of the better purchases I've made.  The quality of the prints I've received has been great (with the exception noted below), and the movie feature is fun too.<br />A word to the wise, if you get you picture developed from this camera (8x10 and below), and you can see pixels in the picture, you should upload one of the pictures to Ofoto for comparison.  I took 26 pictures on disk to my local Target for development and was sorely disappointed at the quality of them.  I uploaded the same pictures to Ofoto, and four days later I got back perfect (35mm quality) pictures.<br />The movie quality isn't great, but it is fun to capture perfect voices along with slightly blurred video to store on disk for eternity.  I picked up a 256mb SD card for the camera, which I can store 200+ top quality pictures and/or 30 minutes video on for < $50.<br />My only problem now is what to do with the three 35mm cameras in my cabinet.  No more wasted film ,or duplicates of pictures with peoples eyes closed for me.  My only gripe is the cheapo lens cover, it comes off all the time.  The new DX4340 seems to have taken care of that problem.<br />Happy shooting!","I got this camera for x-mas in 2002. I had a poloroid  before and I was looking for a more professional camera. since I am 15 I was alittle skeptical about getting it because of the price... I thought for a camera like this it would be more... As soon as I took it out and set up the dock that you can get at any store that sells kodak digi Cameras I was shooting my pets, my room, my family at the reuion our cousin's new baby and I have recently gone to the beach with it and it was great! I has incredible focus and zoom 10X and the clearness of it it outstanding! If you get it though, make sure to get a storage card so it will extend your number of shots...Keep in mind though that the flash dosn't light up things very far and it is alittle bulky to carry... McAuley our basketball team just won states for Maine and I took it to that and it wasn't very clear b/c the civic center had bad lighting...make sure your in a well lighted place and enjoy...Nora","I just purchased this camera a couple of weeks ago, and I love it!  I knew nothing of digital cameras.  Nope, I'm still not an expert, but this camera is so easy to use!  I do not recommend the docking station.  However, I do recommend purchasing the travel pack.  The bag is too big for carrying around town, but it is great for packing.  It comes with the rechargable battery and a charger.  I did buy the docking station, but the travel pack's battery and the ease of transferring directly from the camera to the computer just doesn't warrant the cost.","We bought this camera to take with us on a trip.  Because we weren't sure of the capacity, we also got three 64MB cards and a charger to go with it.  Each card held over 70 pictures on Best quality, so we had more than enough room.  We also ended up taking some short videos that did not seem to deplete the memory very much.<br />The camera takes excellent pictures in a wide range of lighting.  We found that if a picture came out too dark or if the camera adjusted the exposure based on the wrong subject, we could just switch from the Auto setting to Night or Landscape and get a great picture.  Of course, the big advantage of the digital aspect is that you know the results of a bad picture immediately instead of after getting home.  Retake the photo and delete the bad take.<br />We also bought the travel bag, which is too big to actually carry around, but worked OK for packing.  It came with a charger and a spare battery pack, which I highly recommend.  If you use Live View on the camera, the batteries will drain quickly.  You can also drain them by sitting and looking at your pictures for long periods of time.  It's handy to have the charger back in the hotel room getting another battery pack ready for the next day.  With heavy use, which we did, the battery lasted all day.  However, we opted not to use the Live View.  We didn't want to get to an island or somewhere nice and have a dead battery.<br />The software that Kodak provides is excellent for creating albums, slide shows, and getting prints.  Full screen, the photos are clear with excellent color.<br />If we had it to do all over again, we would have bought this camera a long time ago.  We highly recommend it.","I was a intimadated when it came to digital cameras. This one is GREAT. Easy point and shoot. My photos came out good everytime. With the review screen I could delete all the bad photos and retake at that very moment. Goodbye film.","Simple to use and simple to organize pics.  3 megapixels is plenty i have no need for anything larger than 8 1/2  by 10.<br />I love the media","I bought this 4330 about 6 weeks ago and I am very happy with the way it works with ease. I bought the DockII station a week later and glad I did as it keeps the battery charged. The software that comes with the camera is about the easiest thing I've ever seen. Take you picture, plug in the usb cable and bamm, up pops software, click transfer and your done, just that easy. I went on a wholesale trade show in Las Vegas and got some awsome pictures. I don't think I'd be any happier with any other camera. This one is really what I was looking for. Its stylish and for the money, its right on! A++++. Thank you","I bought this camera for my husband for christmas. We love it! we did some price comparison before we purchased our camera and amazon.com had the best deal overall. we saved about $50.00 by purchasing the camera and the dock at the same time. I have never had a digital camera before, but i think i will stick with kodak. This camera is high quality and the zoom is amazing. The sofware could easily be used by a 5 year old.<br />The dock also acts as a battery charger, which charges incredibly fast.","I purchased this camera about 6 weeks ago and around a half hour after I took it out of the box I was taking pictures.  It was that easy. But, don't let the simplicity of use fool you this camera takes great pictures. I have used it in daylight and low light situations with really good results.  I have blown some of the pictures up to 8' X 10' with very little loss in sharpness or color.  The docking station is a must because not only does it charge your battery but with the touch of one button it automatically transfers your pictures to the computer via USB.<br />The camera comes with a Internal Memory card but it is only good for about 10 pictures so it would be wise to purchase a 64mb card or greater depending on use.<br />The LCD display is large enough to see what your taking pictures of but in low light situations you would do better looking through the view finder.<br />The software that Kodak gives you is adequate but to do more editing and special effects Photoshop is the program to use.<br />The camera is good to the feel and is pretty well made except for the Lens cap, which keeps coming off all the time.<br />For someone looking for a really good 3mp camera for a moderate price, this is the one.","I made an extensive search and comparison of prices and features in Feb 2003 and found Kodak DX4330 as the best value for money. Here are the highlights based on 3 weeks of use.<br />It's memory can be expanded with standard MMC cards. It has good zoom and video with sound. 3.1 MPIX photos have same quality as film based cameras with good lens. Pictures taken with flash are also very good. Exporting pictures to PC is very easy and they can be archieved and edited.<br />There are some negatives as well. The quality of video is poor when exported to computer or video recorder. The lens cover does not hold in place. The camera body is plastic and would break if dropped, I'm afraid.","This camera so far takes pretty good pictures.  I think my 35 mm takes better shots but this one does well.  You can access the photos with Windows XP and bypass the Kodak software which I think is great because I think that the Kodak software is not very good.<br />What I was disappointed with is the video function.  You can take 1 min of video with sound which is great.  But the software Kodak gives does not allow you to edit it.  The video function is also not compatible with windows xp.  You can only use QuickTime to view.  And so far from what I researched have to buy the quicktime pro to edit or switch formats.  I was going to buy adobe photoshop 2.0 to edit video but from what I understand adobe photoshop 2.0 is not compatible with the video from this camera.  It is like Kodak just threw in the video function to give some more sell power but didn't spend enough time to make it worthwhile.","In response to the customer from Malibu who had compatability problems with another model, I too Run Windows XP.  I just got the DX4330 last week and the software installed effortlessly.  In addition, I couldn't be happier with the camera.  The picture quality is excellant and for the price it takes surprisingly good video (with great sound.....most other cameras in the price range don't even have sound!).","**PC users this info may not be the most helpfull ;-(<br />I bought this camera to run it through it's paces before a trip to Europe this summer.  I will be using it with a Macintosh, and was nervous as to it's integretation with Apple's iPhoto and iMovie.<br />The camera works flawlessly, and with Apple's built in software you barely need Kodak's bundle.  Just plug in the camera with the supplied USB cable (I plug it directly to the extra port on my keyboard), turn it on and iPhoto and (Kodak's) Easy Share Photo automatically launch.<br />Downloading images to iPhoto is straight foward, but you need the Easy Share software to download movies (automatically downloads them to your 'Movies' folder in OSX).<br />I have already burned a 'test' DVD with the movies that I've recorded.  Quality is good considering it's not a camcorder.  And I can't say how easy it is (just open movie in QT, export it to DV Stream then import into iMovie).<br />The photo quality is great, and colors/saturation is awesome, most of my test shots were taken in a cocktail lounge, and the background looks good (not compleatly black), very important since not all of my pictures will be in bright sunlight...  All in all a very strong preformer.<br />The things that I didn't like are,<br />*  There are only 3 quality settings, all of which are in JPEG format - I would have prefered an uncompressed setting for day to day (when I'm close to the computer and don't need to get 160 shots on the card).<br />*  To get good lowlight shots (even with flash) the camera uses a very slow shutter speed - you have to hold the camera a lot more carefully than I would have thought (takes some practice with that), I guess not a bad trade off if you're aware of it.<br />*  The Microphone picks up a lot of 'Camera Noise', if you change your grip a little (or when pressing the button to record), that will be the loudest noise in the recording.  I would assume that 'Wind Noise' will also be something to be aware of.","Outstanding Digital Camera. Heck of a change from my 6 year old Casio QV-100.  Extremely easy to use and images are super sharp up to 8X10 at max resolution...to be expected with a 3.1 MP camera.  Great at the midrange setting also.  Opt for the largest SD memory card you can afford as you will be firing off pics one after the other. A 64MB SD card will save just a little over 4 minutes of reasonably good quality video. A dock, which simplifies image transfer and recharges the battery ([$$]), is not necessary unless you are a novice and/or are really into convenience. The camera comes with a USB cable for connection to a PC and you can purchase an additional battery and a charger from Kodak for a lot less.  Kodak's Easyshare (included)software is a no brainer and will work fine transferring the images into your PC. It also has good image editing/viewing capabilities. It will save the transferred images to it's own folder (no choice), requiring you to move/copy them if desired.  The only drawback (IMHO) is the videos are in apple quicktime format (which I detest) and are quite large compared to the MPEG format.  Overall a great camera.","I did a lot of research before I bought this camera. One thing no one seemed to talk about much, but that was a big issue for me, was shutter lag. I just hate it when I press a button and have to wait a long time before the camera takes the picture. I thought I wanted an Elph because they're so tiny, but went to different stores, and even with fresh batteries and/or no flash, the Canons and Sonys I tried took forever to take the picture. By the time 1.5 or 2 seconds has gone by, many times your shot is lost forever.<br />But this Kodak is fast. I press the button, and it takes the picture almost immediately. If I hold the button down part-way first to let it focus, then when I press it the rest of the way it does take the picture IMMEDIATELY, even with the flash on.<br />The picture quality is excellent, the software installed perfectly on the very first try (I use Windows 2000), and the very first time I attached the camera to its included USB cord, my computer recognized the camera and I only had to click once to get it to upload the pictures.<br />The video quality isn't great (I knew it wouldn't be), but I love being able to carry this thing around in my purse all the time and snap either pictures or video with sound, any time I want to. I've captured some really memorable moments this way at picnics, at my son's preschool, and other places where I would never have dragged the video camera. And the sound is really excellent.","For every amateur photographer, this camera will prove to be a great investment.<br />Pros:<br />1. Consistently nice pictures with very good color saturation and<br />sharpness.<br />2. Very easy to use with good features (Macro, Portrait, Red-eye, Backlight, Video+Audio, 3X optical zoom, pretty ergonomic)<br />Cons:<br />1. [uses] batterys quickly. Need to get NiMH rechargable battries.<br />2. Xfer speed is slow. Need to get an external card reader.<br />3. Not-so-good transfer and picture handling software.<br />Overall a very nice camera.","As a digital camera, this camera is supurb.<br />You'll like it, and you can find a cheap place to buy it if you look around. I bought this camera for $270.<br />The movie feature that comes with this camera is not that great, the movies have horrible quality, but after all, if you want movies get a camcoder.","I bought this camera last december, It's great, I have to say It's the best buy for the money, The quality is great, great battery life, but the only problems I have found are lot of crashes on the software Easyshare over Win XP, but not big deal. Also I don't like the Quicktime format for Video/Audio (*.mov) because the compression format could be better than this one. The mayor problem I have found is taking pictures at night, most of them are out of focus, or with a orange shadow around the objects, specially if it is a open wide picture.<br />Anyway if the most part of your pictures are going to be taked on good light, don't think it twice, buy this one.","I gave the Kodak digital camera as a Christmas gift.  My wife and I love it.  It's extremely easy to use and takes wonderful pictures.  However, eight days after opening the camera, it acquired an internal error that could not be fixed.  I reported the camera error and problem to Amazon.com.  Amazon.com was very quick to respond and shiped me a new camera within three business days.  Thank you Amazon.com!","The DX4330 is my first digital camera and I am very pleased.  It really is easy and fun to use.  The 3X optical zoom is a very nice feature and the image quality is excellent.<br />It is really nice to pick out the pictures you like, edit them (the free Kodak editing software is very good) and print them.  If you want to do fancy stuff such as add text to the pictures, you will have to use a more powerful editor such as PaintShop Pro or Photoshop Elements.  Instead of printing mine, however, I uploaded them to [local store] for $$$ per 4X6 or $$$ per 5X7.  The results were great!<br />I bought the DX4330 bundled with the Easy Share Dock.  Now that I see what the Dock is all about, I would not recommend others buy it.  It gives you the dock and a NiMH \"Battery Pack.\"  The camera snaps into the dock and it will charge the battery while it is connected.  The USB connection from the dock allows you to transfer your files to you PC also.<br />Here is the rub, however:  The dock will ONLY charge the special Kodak NIMH \"battery pack\" - if you have other NIMH batteries in the camera, it will not charge them.  I think the shape of the plastic shroud on the kodak batttery pack trips a switch inside the camera to tell it that the pack is in there.<br />As to uploading pictures - you don't need the dock.  You can just as easily plug the camera itself into the PC via the USB cable.  Windows sees it as just another hard drive and you can drag and drop you pictures to where you want them.<br />Instead of buying the dock, I would recommend the following:<br />1.) Buy a nice Maha charger and some Powerex 1800 NiMH AA batteries - This will solve your battery problems.<br />2.) Buy a 128MB SanDisk SD card for less than $$$ (they keep getting cheaper).  This will let you store about 100 highest quality photos in your camera instead of about 16 with the internal memory.<br />3.) Buy a cheap SD USB card reader - I bought a PNY model for $$$.  This lets you take the SD card out of the camera and pop it into the card reader to load into your PC - you won't have to connect the camera at all!<br />Hope this helps!","I have had this camera since xmas and it has been well worth the money i paid for it. I was able to get magnificent scenery shots with it which are available to view at [my web site].<br />The timer control for this camera was very handy with warnin red LED's which flash quicker as it gets closer to taking the photo. It has a manual over and under exposure lever which i found very handy for taking certain types of shots.<br />One thing i did find that i did not like was the manual. Although i was able to understand it the rest of the family have been strugling. The camera is also able to make short video clips although the quality is not very good they very handy.<br />I advise to get a 128mb memory card as the internal memory you get with it is not enough as it only allows you 12 best quality shots. Another good idea is to get an extra set of battries and a charger.<br />I did not like that the camera did not come with a case! Which is essential i think.<br />Overall a very good purchase for a beginner!","This is the satisfied purchase I have done all these years.<br />Easy to use, easy to transfer the pictures. Video is with good quality.<br />Cons:<br />Red eye reduction is unavoidable.<br />Lens cover is manual which may damage the lens if not handle perfectly. Battery last longer.","This is the satisfied purchase I have done all these years.<br />Easy to use, easy to transfer the pictures.

I'm a novice when it comes to digital cameras, this was my first one and kodak makes it so easy to work.  I bought the kodak docking station as well which helps recharge batteries and load the pics onto your computer with a touch of a button. This is a great camera for the money and I would recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a digital camera.","Fantastic camera. Pictures are great, price is fair, LCD is good enough. The battery that is included in the package lasts a long time. I took almost 400 pictures (most of them with the LCD on), recorded 2 movies, and the batts are still working.<br />I am completely satisfied. Thanks Kodak!","This is my first 3.1 M digi cam.. after  a lot of skepticism on different models, i  zeroed on this  one.<br />PROS<br />1) Results are fantastic<br />2) Night shots are extremely clear for a camera in this class.<br />3) I have  seen results on equivalent Toshiba, image rendering results on kodak are great.(software is easy to handle)<br />4) Video feature is good.<br />CONS<br />1) Lens cover is  required to  be manually closed, chances of damage to lens.<br />2) Red eye is unavoidable  as with  most cameras.<br />Overall : v. satisfied customer and proud  to be a kodak DX4330 owner","I love this camera.  Batteries last longer than I expected, nice photos, easy to use.  I chose it as it has a good 3 times optical zoom and 3.1 mega pixels.  Most camera seemed to have either one or the other.  Also, consumer reports rated this kodak range to be the best for what I required and was prepared to pay.  My only negatives were that I had a bit of trouble installing the software on my MAC and had to get help from Kodak.  The other negative is that there was an inexplicable black spot on all the photos but as this is a problem with my particular camera once I receive the replacement this shouldn't be a concern.  Overall, highly recommended.","I absolutely love this camera....easy to take everywhere (with back-up batteries)!  Easy to use...FUN to use! I HATE the software!  I am not computer-illiterate, but I can't figure this software out!!  Just going to use Snapfish!","This camera is great!  Very easy to use and the pictures are excellent.  Haven't even begun to explore what all I can do with it.  For a first time digital camera this is definitely the one to get!","I picked one up after reading numerous positive reviews about it. My response after using it is right in line with the rest. Easy to use, excellent quality shots, good features such as movie (plus sound) mode. I've used it at sporting events, at the beach, and at parties. Whether you are indoor or out, the camera works like a charm and captures moving images very well. At the beach some of my shots included seagulls in flight or waves crashing on rocks, and everything came out sharp and crisp.<br />I haven't printed photos off it just yet, but the on-screen shots are simply superb. As good and more likely even better than my 35mm would take.<br />The only constructive criticism I offer is that I wish the camera came with an auto lens shield versus separate lens cap.<br />Docking station sounds convenient but isn't necessary as the software easily uploads images through the ISB cable onto the computer.<br />Happy shooting...","This was my first digital camera buy and I am very pleased with it.  I did a lot of research within this price range and went with the Kodak 4330.  It is is easy to use that any one in my family can just pick it up and start shooting.","This camera is an excellent value for those on a budget looking for quality and ease of use.  The camera is the easiest camera I have ever used and is for the most part just point and click.  The dial settings for macro, action and night shots work very well.  The quality of the pictures are extremely good.  The only thing I would recommend is additional memory for the camera.  I purchased an additional 64 mb which will hold 50 pictures at the highest resolution.  It does consume batteries as any digital camera does, but I have found that the Kodak CRV3 and the Kodak rechargeables last the longest.  I keep a couple of the CRV3 and 2 extra rechargeables in my camera bag as backup.  The dock is a good option for transferring the pictures and for recharging (only works with the Kodak rechargeable battery pack), but I purchased an additional Kodak recharger and that works well for me.  The Easyshare software that is included is good for organizing photos.  Its option to upload pictures to several different photo developing sites is one that I have used for high quality photo prints.  Overall I would highly recommend this camera to novice as well as experienced camera users as a good solid performer for those who don't need all the bells and whistles for low to medium usage.","I own a Kodak DC240 and one thing I hated was the terrible low-light quality. Not any longer. Also great for close up pictures and with simple logical menus. Great bargain. By the way, if you shoot a video and connect the camera for downloading it to the PC, be patient when the EasyShare window comes up and searches for the pictures; it takes much longer than searching for just pictures, which is not surprising. Also, the word video doesn't appear in the window.","This is just fantastic!! The night shot mode is good and gives you clear pictures with correct illumination. 16MB of internal memory and memory slot is too good. The USB cable conectivity and Kodak easyshare software quickly transfer all photographs to your PC.Also with about 64MB of memory card you can shoot about 5 min of video too.For a 3.1 Megapixel there is no other Camera in the market that has such features.","It is probably the best deal for the money. You get 3.3 MP, a movie mode, internal memory and expansion slot. The LCD is not good as the earlier Kodak models like the DC4800, but for that price it really beats all competition. The low light picture quality has also improved since the DC4800. The docking station is not perfect, but is very convenient for casual (non-computer savvy) users.<br />The user interface also needs getting used to, but the main dial matches most point and shoot cameras, so should be a easy transition.<br />It also has a cool address book (email) feature that can be entered on the PC and stored on the camera to email pictures from the camera on the next sync.","I just purchased this camera yesterday after shopping for a number of weeks, and I can't help but like it. The dial that  turns the camera on, to video mode, and to various focus-lengths contributes to making the DX4330 one of the easiest to use gizmos I have ever seen. There's even a sport/fast-motion mode, accessible from the same dial. The pictures seem nice and sharp, and the zoom works really well. There's even a flat space on the back for putting your thumb! It \"just fits\" in my hand, while still being small enough to cart around.<br />I haven't used the software, since I'm on a Mac using iPhoto, but I can tell you it works just fine with that. This also means I haven't used the \"Share\" button to its fullest extent.<br />This camera even has an orientation sensor, so if you take a picture turned 90-degrees, it appears right-side up in the camera screen and in iPhoto. A small feature, yes, but this camera is full of such small features. I'm really impressed with the amount of thought that went in to making it not just a usable camera, but also an enjoyable camera to use.<br />It just works, and it works well. I'm looking forward to using this for a long time. My only regret is that I didn't buy the docking station, as well. Doesn't matter -- Christmas is coming up. :-)"]},{"name":"FujiFilm FinePix 2650 (FinePix A204)","amazon_reviews":["The camera arrived in what appeared to be good condition, and the body of the camera looked great.  Unfortunately, the motor that controls the lens failed the first time I tried to use the camera.  However, I was able to take the camera apart and use the \"door\" to the battery compartment as a replacement on my own FinePix 2650 camera, which had broken.  Worked like a charm, and now I am able to use my own camera.  Took some great vacation photos, just like the photos taken prior to the door replacement.  Since spare parts are no longer available for this camera, and having it repaired was not feasible, this is a great solution for my purposes at a reasonable price.","The GREATEST!!!!  I'm so thankful that you had the camera.  It replced one that was broken.  So glad I found your site!!","Great camera","Does what I expected.  An old camera in the 21st century, but for my use (photographing graveyards), works just fine.","This was my first digital camera. I won't describe the pros and cons of this model as other reviewers have covered this ground already. I used it for over 2 years with no problems, then the front lens became loose. The reason for the failure was evident upon disassembly. The outer barrel (the part that protrudes from the camera body) is held by three metal pins mounted on plastic tabs that are part of the lens barrel. One side of one tab broke, releasing the pin holding that side of the barrel in place. I suspect that the inner zoom lens barrel may have caught on the inside of the outer barrel, straining the tab and breaking it. Ordinarily it would be a simple fix to switch the lens to a new outer barrel, but if the entire lens assembly is sold as a unit, the repair would probably cost more than a new camera.<br /><br />If all the moving parts were metal rather than plastic, the camera would probably last forever. Then again, others have commented on the limited life of the viewscreen, so my suspicion is that the entire unit is only intended to last a short period (by which time it would be obsolete anyway). Digital camera design is progressing so rapidly that no one should buy one without the intention of replacing it in a few years. If you want a camera you can pass down to your grandchildren, film is still the way to go.<br /><br />I do need to comment on some of the other reviewers' observations:<br /><br />1. The camera stops working - permanently - if you drop it or knock it off a table: This issue isn't limited to this model - virtually every electronic device will break if dropped or handled roughly. Many cell phones will take an incredible amount of abuse - if you want an indestructible camera, get a cell phone with a camera built-in.<br /><br />2. The camera is too thick: It's about the same size and shape as a 35 mm snapshot camera. I suspect this is a problem only because much thinner digital cameras are now available - no one ever complained about this with the older film cameras.<br /><br />3. The image in the viewfinder doesn't correspond exactly to the captured image: Again, just like a film camera with a viewfinder. Unless one is looking through the lens, parallax wil ensure that the viewed image differs from the final photograph. Even SLR film cameras only show 90-95% of what the film sees in the viewfinder.<br /><br />Overall this camera was a great introduction to digital photography.","Didn't want to take my good camera to New Orleans but wanted good touristy photos...I used to own one of these so I already had a huge memory card for it, then grabbed this one.

I don't need to see the individual atoms on a hair :)","I purchased this camera when it was first released by Fuji and nearly 7 years later, I still use it.<br /><br />I recently upgraded to a Fujifilm Finepix A850 Digital Camera 8.1 Megapixels 3x Optical Zoom ISO800 (Picture Stabilization) 2.5-inch LCD that I'm no where near as pleased with as I with this one.  And most times, I will still use this camera when taking indoor photos.<br /><br />This is an excellent camera that takes quality photos and will last for many years.","For the first camera that I've taken to shows, this little guy performed surprisingly well.<br /><br />For being so bulky with lackluster zoom (thank goodness I was in the front row for all 4 concerts in a row for Flaming Lips last fall), I surprised myself with the nice quality of the shots I got.<br /><br />I even took some nice ones from pretty far back @ Better than Ezra at the Wildflower Fest 07.<br /><br />The time it takes for this to power up is what really got on my nerves:  I actually MET the Flaming Lips twice while we followed them around in the Fall and both times I was heckled by the band (in a nice way of course -- best bunch of guys you could ever meet) due to the elderliness of my camera and how we had to stand around for so long waiting for the thing to turn on.<br /><br />The key with this little one is either BRIGHT light and slow situations or shoot a BILLION pictures to assure the fact that you will get some good ones (I would get about 200 good ones out of 400 and so on).<br /><br />I upgraded to the Finepix s700 6 months ago and I've already outgrown that, but for just quick point n shoot spur of the moment type things, this camera would probably do the trick.","I had this camera back in 2003, it takes great photos.  I dropped it into the sand, and we all know what sand does to cameras.  I now have an Olympus E-300 dSLR, and a film SLR, but I wanted a small, but not too expensive, camera for my purse.  I bought just bought another 2650 for a few bucks, refurbished by Fuji, which shows you how much I think of the image quality.  For those people who are saying the image quality is not good, you really don't know what you are doing.  The image quality produced a perfect 5x7 and a good 8x10.  It is sharp, colors a fuji fine and at these prices now, why not get a cheapy and carry it around with you.  If it gets stolen, you will not worry too much about it.  Again I will say, this is a great little camera.","I loved this camera so much.  It was a present, but they did a good job choosing it.  I had it for a year and a half.  It was very durable because I had dropped it once or twice on wood and it worked fine, then it got dropped a final time bouncing off a metal chair to concrete and the zoom lens broke, but it still works, just all the pictures are blurry.  So I'm saying good-bye and getting another fujifilm because I invested in a larger xdcard and because I really liked the quality of these pictures.  They were very crisp and clear even when printed-and lots of my friends cameras produced grainy shots with only 2.0 megapixels.  I took some really nice yearbook photos for friends with it that came out really nice. So overall it's an excellent camera that I would tell anyone to buy if they didn't want to spend too much money on one.","I received this item as a Christmas gift last year and boy was I surprised!  I love this camera, being that it's my first digital camera.<br /><br />I love that it's cute and compact. Trust me though, it's way better than the 2600 series.  It has 3X optical zoom and takes pictures at a 2.0 MEGA PIXELS.  Pretty low mega pixels. It comes with a hand strap, camera software, 16-MB picture card, USB-cable, picture/camera software (Windows XP/Win 98'), and comes with 2 Fuji AA-batteries which let's you start having fun once you open the box.  It has a 1.5 inch color LCD screen which let's you control the brightess of it, also it lets you pan a picture after you've taken it.  You can view 9-images simultaneously.  It has a one finger-touch easy to open lens cover and a one finger touch picture taking button. The \"MACRO\" feature is pretty awesome, you can zoom into your subject to take a close-up picture.<br /><br />My suggestions are this:  Buy rechargeable AA-batteries and a charger for this camera because since it requires only 2-AA-batteries it will eat them up quickly.  Also, it's a bit slow after taking a picture, meaning the recovery time is slow and you can't really take pictures one after the other quickly enough.  You have to have a steady hand in order to take a picture and your subject needs to also be in a steady position.  Moving objects don't photograph very well.  If you choose to do a manual flash or no flash at all be prepared to take a lot of blurry pictures no matter how steady your hand is.  I suggest leaving the camera on AUTO at all times.  It does take some really nice pictures though, proof of this is in the \"Customer Images\" at the top of this page.  Basically, you get what you pay for.  It's a camera built for vacation snap shots, not to build your creative/artistic picture library or to start your picture taking hobby, for this you'd need a higher MEGA PIXEL or SLR camera.  Another tip, get a higher capacity/MB picture card, the 16MB only holds about 30-pictures.  Also, invest in a picture card reader so that your camera's port doesn't waste as quickly.","I've had this camera for over two years (it's my first digital camera) and I am very happy with it. I've taken thousands of pictures and the camera is still going strong.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Very inexpensive<br />-Transporting pictures onto the computer is super easy<br />-Has a nicely sized viewing screen so you can see the pictures you've taken<br />-Definitly pays for itself over and over again<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Very big and bulky compared to some other models out there on the market<br />-The clarity of some pictures is not good (flash should be stronger)<br /><br />All in all, I would buy this camera again. The only thing I would really change would be to make the flash stronger (so the pictures will be clearer) and mainly, make the camera thinner. It is very thick and impossible to keep in your pocket and takes up a ton of room in your purse.","I bought this camera about two years ago and loved it.  The picture quality is better than most cameras that cost 5x as much.  The shutter speed is slow (a tip: if you hold the botton down halfway it will autofocus and then you can take the picture immediately when you are ready) and the camera's bulky -- but the photos this camera takes are amazing.<br /><br />The problem is that it was dropped today (I won't say by whom) and now it is kaput (grey LCD, etc. like what happened to about 5 other reviewers).  So I guess consider this thing a disposable camera.  If you plan on buying another camera in a year or so, anyway, then this camera is for you.","The quality of the pictures this camera takes are more than you would expect from an entry level digital camera. Well worth the money.","This was my first digital camera.  The price is excellent, especially for what you get!  The camera is bulky and slow, but I disagree with those who say it's not durable; I've taken it many places with me and dropped it (accidentally!) but it still functions just as well.  The camera takes very nice pictures, and for this price, it is an excellent deal.  The only two drawbacks are its size and speed.  It is not a good camera for quick shots - it takes a while to start up and respond after you press the button to take a picture.  However, the pictures turn out excellently!  I highly recommend this camera to anyone on a budget that still wants beautiful quality photos; I've been very satisfied!","I've had this for almost 2 years now, and am very satisfied.  I'm not a contant user, but have probably taken close to a thousand pics by now - all look great.  These cameras make pictures more fun - no messing with film, picking up, storing - just load on the computer.<br /><br />The reason I'm writing is to make a comment on durability.  This seems like a pretty fragile camera, very lightweight and obviously very few steel or metal parts in there.  When I fumbled it onto a barely carpeted wood flow from almost 6 feet, therefore, I figured it was history. I picked it up and turned it on - nothing.  Cursing and depondent, I popped the hood to ascertain the damage.  Once inside, I noticed the memory card was a little askew. I pushed it back in place, closed her up, and voila - worked like new again.<br /><br />Maybe it landed at just the right angle, or maybe I'm just very lucky, but I have to hand it to any camera that can survive a 6 foot dead drop with no permanent damage.","Being someone who just takes pictures for fun, I wanted a digital camera that was little bit more than a point-and-click.  This camera offered that.  The menu is easy to use and for an amateur, it is very easy to get accustomed to.  The pictures come out pretty well.  The only thing I wish I had on it would be a stronger zoom but for what it does offer, it's not bad.  Uploading the photos from the camera to the computer is very easy also.  Again, this camera is great for someone who is looking for digital technology but is not exactly the most camera savvy person.","pros<br />This camera produces excellent quality images.<br />light weight and sturdy<br />cons<br />Takes long time to get ready between shots<br />No video output to TV","great little camera. it has all the functions needed without getting screwed over with one button like those $40-110 ones... they all suck. this is basically the bare minimum for a cute little camera. GREAT FOR HIKING! you can't drop it off the mountian and get totally upset cause its not a horribly expensive camera!!!","Being clueless about digital cameras, I spent over six months researching all the brands and options before settling on the Fuji 2650, picking it up on a \"day after Christmas\" sale with a combination of gift cards and about $100 out of pocket.  This is an outstanding camera for the money! Yes, it eats batteries, but this is pretty much a \"standard\" feature\" of digital cameras, and this one does have power saving features that reduce this problem.  Plus, It only uses 2 AA's at a time.  Find a good deal on Alkaline batteries, or buy rechargeables.<br /><br />  With both night and macro (extreme close up) modes, it works awesome under any condition.  There is a good range of features and the software is both easy to install and use.  I may \"move up\" to a 3 megapixel at some point down the road... but if I do, it'll be a Fuji!  If you are looking for a great camera at a fair price, buy the Fuji 2650!","I got my camera last Christmas, and I'm glad to say it has lasted me a year. The layout of the camera is simple. You just probably just take it out of the box and start using it without the manual (that's what I did). Switch from the camera view to the view pictures screen to the camera view instantly by just moving a dial. They're even labeled well! Camera view is a camera, the picture viewer is a Play button icon, and the video view is a video recorder picture. It doesn't take a lot of thought to tell which one is which.<br />The image quality is good. It works for me. Some people aren't fond of it, though. But if you're someone who doesn't need huge, perfect, crisp photos every time, like me and most of us, this is the camera. The quality lowers a bit when pictures are taken in very dark areas, but still turn out. The most pictures you can take is about 130, the dimentions about 800 x 600 (it could be 1024 x 768, I'm not quite sure), the smallest dimentions. You take take HUGE ones, but you are limited to about 15 of them. The # you can take depend on the battery juice and the amount of pictures and their quality already token.<br />Battery juice is the only drawback. It drains them in about 2-4 hours. ALWAYS bring extra.<br />It does take a little while for the camera to load and prepare for a picture after you've already taken one. It depends on the setting of No Flash, Flash, No Red Eye, or Auto.<br />In conclusion, if you aren't some magazine photographer and just want it for personal, family, or web site use, this is the perfect camera. It's cheap, too ;).","Ours was stolen, recently, out of our mini-van, along with a portable DVD player.  We just found the same camera on clearance, while doing our after Thanksgiving shopping, and snapped it up!  We were never unhappy with the hundreds of pictures we had taken and, though you can now get higher resolution with more megapixels for about the same price we had originally paid, we were always happy with the original, so we stuck with it.  The worst part about having the camera stolen was that we had splurged for the 256Mb card, which was expensive, and it did have some not-yet-uploaded pics on it.<br />  You will definitely need a larger memory card, and don't hesitate to get the rechargeable batteries, although this camera is not a battery hog, like some I've seen.  Still, if you like to view the just-taken pics using the LCD screen, you'll use up the batteries fairly quickly, and being able to recharge them is great.","This is a great little camera.  It's small, sturdy and does its job very well.  I've had mine for 3 years and it's holding up beautifully.  I've never had a single problem with it (occasionally I'll lose a memory card but that's my problem).<br />I think it would be great for someone just starting out in digital photography.  It is simple to use (easy to switch modes, photo quality, flash options etc.) and takes a great photo.<br />I couldn't ask for a better little camera.  Good invenstment.","FOR A $150.00 YOU CAN'T GO WRONG. I LOVE MINE, GREAT BUY!!!","This camera is small and perfect for the beginner.  It is easy.  It delivers crisp and sharp photos.  It is reasonably priced.  I am very Happy with it.","I bought this as my first digital camera last Christmas. It was so easy to use and set up. The picture quality is great.  It was recently stolen and I'm going to buy another one just like it.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who doesn't like to read directions.","This is the first digital camera that I owned.  I didn't want to go all out, like some of my friends and buy an expensive camera, but I wanted a digital camera.  This camera is wonderful for the price.  It takes great pictures, although trying to take pictures of small things up close, doesn't work too well.  They come out a little blurry, but it is wonderful!","Positives - Outstanding photo quality, ease of use, ruggedness (have dropped it a few time), AA battery use (for pete's sake, invest in rechargables...), good software.<br />Negatives - compact - but smaller options available in the market, XD cards cost slightly more than SD or CF cards, flash takes at least 5-7 seconds to recharge (annoying if you want to take another shot quickly...), no TV out capability.<br />Bottom Line - Excellent photo quality. Highly recommended for basic users.","I just got my FinePix 2650 from Amazon yesterday, and I'm delighted. It has far exceeded my expectations. For a budget camera, the photo quality is excellent.<br />This camera is so easy to use that I was taking pictures of my family within about 2 minutes of opening the box. I hadn't even read the manual yet, but everything seemed so intuitive, even for a newbie like me. The pictures were sharp and clear, and my family was thrilled.<br />Apart from the modern styling of the unit, its logical design, its high quality construction and its ease of use, there are two other features that deserve special mention: the 3X optical zoom, and the powerful flash. This unit features a true optical zoom which allows you to capture detail that's just not possible with a digital zoom. Additionally, the powerful flash is good for about 10ft or more in low light conditions, and is more than adequate for your average living room.<br />Transferring images to the PC is so simple, once you're using Windows XP, that I haven't even bothered to use the included software. I just connected the camera to my PC via the USB cable, let Windows install the device, and my photos were downloaded in about a minute. I then used my own graphics software, PaintShop Pro, to edit and print the photos.<br />Although my novice efforts are unlikely to win any artistic awards, I'm more than happy with the results produced. For the price, I think this Fuji is an unbeatable value. I enthusiastically recommend this camera.","We have had this camera a year now and love it more every day. I too was worried about the 2 mp but you would never know it. It has replaced our $400 35mm and takes as good of shots. Printing has been outstanding up to 8x10. We use Mystic Color Labs to print all of our real photos and have been nothing but pleased. No one ever knows it was a digital camera, even after getting photos from us with the expensive camera.<br />My only advice...<br />Do not get caught up in the pixel game. More rarely means better.<br />Doug","was putting off getting digital camera; they way technology advances these days, camera in today could be obsolete tomorrow, anyway, received fugi 2650 as a birthday present, very impressed; agreed with one reviewer regarding software, totally useless and not needed if you have XP.  absolute best camera for the price, please buy the camera from major local outfit, not online to save a couple of dollars.  you can take it back with no hassles, but you wont.  will definitely need rechargeable batteries, also available with charger and 4 AA batteries for around 20.00.  overall great camera and would highly recommend to anyone with no regrets.  crusher j","I am an avid, if novice photographer, and have been putting off buying a digital camera for ages now. I finally couldn't resist any longer, and ended up buying the Fuji 2650, and i have to say it was definitely worth the money. It's easy enough for a beginner to be able to pick up and feel comfortable using it right away. Photo quality so far has been excellent. My one minor complaint, is that the batteries end up dying VERY quickly. But overall, an excellent camera.","I bought this camera as a birthday gift to my mother. Both my mother and father love it. They told me that it is small, light and handy. The pictures are bright and sharp. The camera itself is easy to operate. The software is also very friendly. I am satisfied with this purchase.","This camera is worth twice the money. The resolution is excellent, better than some cameras with 3 megapixels. The macro is the best I've seen for under $300. The colors are realistic and smooth. I've purchased 2 other cameras recently that were supposed to be much &quot;better&quot;, but this fuji 2650 beats them hands down! The macro is great; I got great pix at 3 inches away, crisp and clean. You have to go to 200% magnification to even begin to start to see pixellation. At usual sizes it's breathtakinlgy clear. BUY ONE BEFORE THEY'RE GONE!<br /><br /> The only drawback is that the software seems confusing and complicated, but I'm sure it's just a matter of time. The picture quality is worth it!","When I purchased this camera, I had no idea how much I would fall in love with it!<br /><br />I come with a solid background in film photography.  I own 5 35mm cameras which range from a 3D relic to my Cannon A1 SLR.  With the new addition of my FinePix 2650 I am able to enjoy photography.  The processing cost was the largest problem.  Then you need a scanner to scan pictures.  Then you have to deal with drivers that don't load properly.  Then the pictures don't look as good as you would expect... then... then...<br /><br />Digital photography is awesome!  This is the way photography is supposed to be.  The FinePix 2650 produces a decent picture at 2M.  The resolution choices are adequate for general photography.  The software that comes with the camera is also adequate.  I eventually purchased a NiMH batteries (they blow away NiCad's)and a 128M card so I wouldn't have to keep running to my computer so often to download my pictures to clear out my 16M card.  It stores up to 990 640x480 pictures!!! And over 300 1M pictures!<br /><br />This camera has solved my general photography needs ... until ... I dropped it one time too often.  Moral of the story...if you want to have a great digital camera last, don't drop it...ever!  And think about purchasing a service contract...I didn't want to and I regret it now!","I always wanted a digital camera but could never find a good price for one.  I usually used the disposable types.  After using this camera several times, I think the convienience is worth the extra amount of money spent.  You never have to drop off film, pick it up or make doubles.  Everything can be done on your computer and printer.  Also, you cna take 30 seconds worth of video and trnsfer it to a CD with any music or sounds ou like.<br />The camera itself takes beautiful pictures.  It is great to see the pictures via LCD screen and delete them if you don't like it.  Also, the memeory is fairly large and I never took the maximum amount of shots before uploading them to my computer.<br />The power is great. I had it for a couple of weeks and did not have to change the batteries yet with everyday usage.  The camera takes 2 AA batteries which is another plus since ou don't have to worry about buying a $80 rechargable battery once it dies out.<br />Overall, i like this camera and would definitely endorse it.  The only thing that I didn't like was that it did not come with a carrying case.","this camera is awesome!!!! it will pretty much do anything i want it to do. this is a great camera for beginners. and i'm not a beginner, and this camera is awesome. i'm not planning on getting a camera for the next 3 years. the picture resolution is very very good. even with the picture resolution set to normal, it takes very good pictures! the xD picture card is also very very good, it takes less power, it is the best card, and this card is gonna stay around for awhile. the only problem with this camrera is the sliding lens. if it gets knocked around with it open, it might jar it slightly, and maybe knock it off. but fujifilm fixed it for free. one time, i went backpacking for a week in the mountains, and the camera was the best! it really proved this camera is durable and very well made. when i needed it the most, it didn't fail on me. also if your gonna get this camera, or any digital camera, you have to get \"radio shack rechargeable nickel-metal hydride batters\" there the best! when i went backpacking, i was worried i wasn't going to have enough batters, so i bought more. i didn't even use them! and to test it, one time i fully charged the batters up, put them in my fujifilm 2650 camera, (with power saver off)and i left my camera on. it was the third day when the batters finally died out. overall, this camera is one of the best!","I bought the Asian version of this fantastic digital camera in Hong Kong about 10 months ago, and it has performed admirably under heavy usage.  This is definitely a very high-quality camera.  My 3rd Fuji, and I'm glad this one has a lens cover, unlike previous Fuji cameras (film or digital).  This one is also very stylish and cool, and the movie mode works exceptionally well (albeit no sound).  Picture quality is superb!  Bright and vivid colors.  I paid twice as much for this camera in HK, but no regrets whatsoever.  This is wildly popular in Asia, so you'll be in good company if you get one. :)","I am \"technically-challenged.\"  This camera is SO EASY to use, the instructions are simple, I did not need my kids or grandkids to \"figure it out, then show me!\"  It does everything it says it can, and the photos look professional!","This is an excellent product for everyday use. It is not for the pro photographer, but excellent value and features for the everyday joe like me. 2MP is great, 3x Optical Zoom is great. You definitely need rechargeable Ni-MH batteries and a bigger memory card. Comes with 16mb, I added a 32mb. GREAT  BUY !!!","I LOVE this camera.  It is so EASY to use.  I received it yesterday, and I am using it as though I have had it for years.  The instructions are easy to understand, and that is important for someone who is \"challenged/intimidated\" by anything more complicated that \"start & stop\" buttons.  I did not have to have my children or grandson \"figure it out\" to show me how to use it.","I was worried that a 2MP digital camera { at a lower price} was going to leave me wishing that I should have gone for a more expensive one.  Boy, was I wrong.  This is one nice camera.  Most of the pictures I have taken have been emailed and the comments have all been about how sharp the pictures are and the perfect colors - and I've only used the \"normal\" setting on the camera.  I can just imagine what the \"fine\" setting will give.  I have a subpar printer, so I can't give an accurate description of prints.  But if they're anything like what I've put up on my monitor, I'll have nothing to worry about.  Some have said that battery life is low, but I just keep extras in my case and I have no problems.  The picture quality is well worth the minor inconvenience of switching batteries.  I recharge my own, so excessive battery cost is of no concern.  If you're looking for a good entry-level digital camera, this one will not disappoint you.","I don't have a lot of fancy things to say about this camera except that I love it. I bought my husband a Vivitar for fathers day and it was awful. I exchanged it for this Fuji and am thrilled. It tkes great pictures for the average user. The optical zoom is wonderful for the closeup pictures my husband takes for ebay. The only downside is the wait between picture taking. Other than that It is great.","When we decided to purchase a digital camera we admittedly knew very little about them. Therefore we relied on online reviews and such to help us find the right camera. In so doing we came upon the Fuji FinePix 2650.<br />Here was a camera that didn't have a million different features, but seemed to have everything necessary to take a good picture. We were told by someone who knew quite a bit about digital cameras that having both a digital zoom and an optical zoom was a very good thing. We found that most cameras in our price range did not have this feature, but the Fuji did. There were just enough menu options for us to feel like we could do a range of things and take a variety of shots. It's light weight though a bit thick. And the quality of pictures that the Fuji took was very nice. Find the right printer and paper and it would rival professionally developed pictures.<br />A few drawbacks to the camera--<br />~As many other reviewers noted, digital cameras eat up batteries. We had only take about thirteen or fourteen shots when the low battery icon came on. The power saver mode kicks in pretty quickly when the camera is on, but that didn't seem to be enough to make the batteries last longer.<br />~In an attempt to save some battery power, we thought we'd buy a memory card reader so that we didn't have to have the camera on in order to download the pictures onto my laptop. The problem with that was that because, as we were told, Fuji has a XD card none of the readers were compatible. Except for, that is, the one put out by Fuji, which was just too much money to actually purchase.<br />~The camera comes with a 16 MB card, but we figured we'd get the 128 MB and not have to worry about how many pictures we took for some time. Now, the Fuji cards aren't cheap so we looked for a \"generic\" one that was a bit cheaper. A similar problem to the one above occurred. Fuji and Olympus seem to be the only manufacturers that produce the XD card right now. So we were stuck with the cost of the Fuji card.<br />Overall, the camera was a wonderful purchase. If you want it simply to take on vacations and day trips and such you couldn't do any better. The price is right and it's fun to experiment with. One thing is that I'd recommend buying rechargeable batteries--We found an Energizer kit that charges in an hour, is small/thin enough to pack, and the batteries are cheaper than some. I think I can honestly say that, even if we had known about some of the things stated above beforehand, we still would have purchased the Fuji FinePix.","This review if for kids under 13...actually, ... Anyway...<br />I recieved the Fujifilm FinePix 2650 for my eighth grade graduation gift. Although I have only had it for several hours, I have already gone through a 16 MB card full of pictures and printed several. Note to whoever said that if you didn't have Windows XP, don't install: I have Windows Millenium on my Dell 8500, and the software installed just fine for me!<br />I didn't expect to find such high-quality pictures on a digital camera that was so inexpensive. If you take a picture in a half-lit room, it still brings great lighting and clarity to the picture as the auto flash lights it up.<br />I would say that there are only two drawbacks to the entire camera: 1.) The lighting in one room at my house wasn't the best. I couldn't see through the screen (I could through the viewfinder, just not the digital screen) what I was taking a picture of. The picture still came out great, but it would have been nice to see what I was photographing.<br />  2.) There is an option for taking videos, but the camera doesn't have audio, and therefore you have a silent movie.<br />Overall, I would say that this is an extremely high-quality camera for under $200. I would recommend it to anyone thinking about a digital camera but not sure if they could afford on - it's great!","I just received this camera for my birthday, and it's great!  The picture quality is great, and it's very easy to operate.  My biggest complaints are size (*it's a little thick), high aperture, no ISO settings, and the bundled software is very weak.  Overall though, it's great!","I have owned this camera for about 11 months.  It worked very well at first, especially outdoors.  My only complaint is that the flash tends to wash out colors and gives too much red-eye indoors.  For the last couple of weeks, the camera has had trouble focusing, regardless of how well lit the subject is.  I hesitate to send it in for repair for 2 reasons:  First, the problem is intermittent and I am afraid that Fuji will claim that they cannot find a problem and will just send it back without fixing it.  Secondly, my wife and I have a new baby and don't want to be without a camera for the amount of time it would take to have it fixed.<br />Overall, this is a good entry level camera.  However, my next digital camera will be from a company with a proven history of quality and reliability.","After having this camera for a month now, I really must concede to the fact that I couldn't be happier with it.<br />Before purchasing the Fuji Finepix 2650, I looked into a seemly endless variety of other digital camera options. Yet from the beginning, my intentions, desires and constraints were very clear - Although I needed a camera that would perform well as a vessel for making high quality prints, what I really needed was an economically feasible camera that would excel in effectively providing me with photos for online posting. After looking into comparable models in Sony's Cybershot series, Nikon's Coolpix series, Cannon's Powershot Series and Kodak's EasyShare series, I discovered quite simply that the Finepix 2650 is a marvel of a fit for my distinct needs over all the rest.<br />For this camera's price, you really cannot get a better deal. With a CCD rating 2.0 megapixels, you get incredible photo quality capable of displaying images at 1600 x 1200 resolution. For the great majority, this photo quality is more than enough for intermediate-to-advanced use. With regards to such intermediate-to-advanced use, compounded upon the camera's extremely versatile Automatic setting, a fully featured Manual setting is also offered. When assigned to Manual mode, the user is given the option to toggle white-balance settings for appropriate color saturation and hue, shutter speed for low-light photography and exposure compensation for effective light-intensity balance and color separation. The Finepix 2650 features 5 flash modes that include an automatic setting, forced flash, suppressed flash, red-eye reduction and a slow-synchro mode for nighttime/low-light scenarios. Available on both Automatic and Manual modes, is an excellent macro-mode that is used to take extremely detailed photos at lens distances as miniscule as 2 centimeters. After playing with the macro feature on a myriad of different subjects, I am completely astounded at the level of detail evident in each photo even at the low-quality settings. The last and slightly less impressive feature of the Finepix 2650 is it's ability to shoot full-motion video. On the plus side, video resolution is pretty good boasting the ability to record at a 320 x 240 VGA display. On the negative side, however, the exclusion of an internal microphone means that that there are no audio recording capabilities. A more practical use for this camera's video capturing option is that of a webcam. In fact, included in the bundled software package is a webcam/web-conferencing tool.<br />This camera runs off of 2 alkaline or nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries. When compared to other cameras, the Finepix 2650 has a lower power usage rating that obviously translates into extended battery life. Albeit a slight advantage over other models, this camera still eats through batteries along with the best of them. I highly recommend picking up a set of rechargeable nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries with a power rating at least 1700Mah. One feature of the camera that no doubt contributes to this camera's lower power drain is it's exploitation of the xD media format. The latest in what seems to be a whole sea of memory cards, the FujiFilm/Olympus/Lexar proprietary xD Picture Card is known for it's low power drain. The xD Picture Card, barely the size of a penny, also features transfer and read/write speeds far greater than Panasonic's SD format or Sony's Memory Stick. Bundled with the Finepix 2650 is a 16Mb xD card which, in most cases, is somewhat adequate. However, most will find the need to upgrade to at least a 64Mb xD card.<br />All in all, the Finepix 2650 is a great, feature-loaded camera that is available at an extremely reasonable price. Easily one of my best purchases - Highly recommended.","Have had this camera for 6 wks. and can't find anything wrong with it yet. The clarity and resolution are outstanding especially using the macro and zoom lenses. Does a great job inside or outside, low light or bright sunshine. The ease of taking photos-downloading and emailing is just phenomenal. We have an iMac and was concerned about compatibility, but not to worry it worked the 1st time with a card reader and every time since without using any special software. Was told we would need a tripod, but haven't needed to use one yet. And the price was terrific at Amazon. This camera is an all around winner!","Very great quality for a 2 megapixel camera. The lcd display is very very very detailed. The only problem is that the camera's a little bit bulky. But overall, this is a great camera.","I did a lot of comparison shopping before choosing this camera.  I took it on vacation with a friend who had a Kodak digital camera and we were impressed with how much better my shots were.  Unless you're planning to make a lot of prints over 5x7, the quality is more than adequate.  Another reviewer mentioned a frequent warning about having your hand over the lens, but they're mistaken - that refers to the fact that, having turned the flash off, you're at risk for a blurred picture due to low light.  It's hard to hold the camera still enough in that situation.<br />I love how lightweight and easy to use it is.  My only real compaint is that I run through the batteries pretty quickly, maybe because I can't resist looking at every shot after I've taken it, so I have to always have spares with me. There've been a couple times when I was stuck with no charged batteries.  You have to get used to staying on top of that.  On vacation, I find that easy to do, but sometimes around home, I miss out on impromptu photo ops for lack of batteries.  Get yourself several sets.  My first digital camera used 4 AA batteries, though.  At least this one only uses 2!","This camera is good for what you pay for.  My main gripes are that the LCD screen isn't as crisp as some that I've seen, and that it takes forever to recharge after each shot.  I'm sure lithium batteries would work better than the NiMH batteries that I'm using, but that would get to be too expensive.  Also, the picture quality isn't the greatest.  All in all, it's defintely a good buy if those shortcomings are ok with you.","I purchased the Finepix 2650 because of its {inexpensive} price. I figured it would just be my \"starter cam\" and my introduction into digital photography. But let me tell you, I LOVE this camera. It is so easy to use, its nearly point-and-shoot. A friend of mine purchased a 4 MP camera (twice the MP) for twice the price - and my photos *always* turn out ten times better than hers. She tries all different settings, but she always gets the same grainy results. Not so with the Finepix. I recently tested the zoom ability by taking the Finepix to a baseball game. We had seats in the very back of the stadium, yet I managed to get a closeup shot of the first base area that was crisp and clear! All that with just 3x Optical zoom!<br />My only complaint about this camera is the webcam option. I've never been able to get this option to work properly - the images are so black and dark you can't make out any images unless you have a direct spotlight on them, and then the coloring is very red. I downloaded all the right drivers, same problem. I wrote to the tech support of Fujifilm digicams, and they've never responded. Luckily, I don't have much need for a webcam - but they probably shouldn't advertise it as such when it doesn't really work.<br />All in all, I'd highly recommend this great deal of a camera to anyone interested in digital photography.","I purchased this item for my Grandmother.  She loves it, and has no trouble using.  The pictures are great.","I got this fuji finepix 2650 a week ago.<br />The camera takes very good pictures.<br />Also it come with a great price.","I bought mine, of course, for a lot more than what is on the site right now, *but* it, in my opinion, was a good investment.<br />Never before had I thought I'd use a camera so much more than I have ever previously used one. The batteries on older digital cameras were gross. About an hour off of four AA batteries. No more, folks. My cam works on 2 AA rechargable batteries for about 5 - 10 hours and then it only takes an hour tops to charge again. If you buy two pairs and charge both up before you leave then you're good to go!<br />The zoom is wonderful. Unless you're going to be taking exceedingly long shots of something you won't need a further zoom. REMEMBER: 3x Optical Zoom, 2 or 3x Digital Zoom, and then on top of it all if you put it on the highest \"best\" quality, you get an image that's like 1600x1200 or something like that. I usually scale my pics when I save them to 800x600 (or whatever) just so I can fit them on my computer screen fully without cutting 1/2 of it off when trying to view it. Best of all if you take a pic with the highest setting and zoom all the way in with the optical zoom (the digital zoom is sort of [bad] but that's the same for all digi cams), take the pic, and then cut out what you'd like when you edit them on your computer. 800x600 is bigger than a regular sheet of paper printed on an ink jet, btw...<br />The only *problem* I have with this cam at all is that the images without flash are a bit dim unless it's exceedingly light (I'm talking halogen light brightness). With the flash and with the image close enough you should have no problems. Due to the brightness fact and the Ineptitude of Windows XP the contrast/brightness controls all are not available... I will look for another update to my software, but to this day the webcam feature is kind of [useless] unless you have a window or a hugely bright room.","I had been on the lookout for a small, handy tool that would capture the different colors that I see everyday. What else other than the Fuji 2650. It's handy, easy to use and its is cheaper than the other market players.<br />The optical zoom is the best possible feature in it and then there is this macro zoom facility.<br />The silent movie mode is not all that useful as the movies are mute movies.<br />In a nutshell - fuji 2650 is the best 2.1 MP camera in market today. Go for it and you will not repent !!!","Great camera, the pictures come out great, very high quality.  The flash works as it should, and even in low light the pictures will come out great - i'm not sure why others are having problems with this camera in low light.<br />My only complaint is that it's hard to see the lcd screen outside on a sunny day.  The camera is kinda big, but easy enough to store in your pocket.<br />It's a lot easier to plug the camera into your PC and take the pics right off the camera via windows explorer, instead of using the software that comes with the CD.  Would recommend to all.  Picture's I take can be find at ...delamente...","FinePix 2650 never disappoints me as a beginner's camera at this price except that the xD card it uses is too expensive. I just happened to see that Nikon Coolpix 2100 has a lot more functions packed in there, but only about US$... more expensive. Coolpix 2100 is small enough to fit in your palm or shirt pocket. How do you like that? Portability is a key factor keeping your from using the camera. These days, you may need some 256M+ or at least 128M memory at least on a vacation. With that taken into account Nikon Coolpix 2100 should actually be cheaper with more functions. I never owned Coolpix 2100, but you may get professional advice at dpreview or steves-digicams online for further information, before you make any decisions. Deals are on the net all the time these days. Deals on one site could be higher than routine prices on another. Going google with key words like \"deal time\" to find professional sites to evaluate your deals of whatever product you have should also be very important.","FinePix 2650 never disappoints me as a beginner's camera at this price except that the xD card it uses is too expensive.

Going google with key words like \"deal time\" to find professional sites to evaluate your deals of whatever product you have should also be very important.","I picked up this camera after reading through all the reviews on this site and I must say I am very plesantly surprised with it. It has great color and the zoom is just fabulous. It's a little big and somewhat clunky for someone with small hands like mine, but nothing you can't get used to. As for the proprietary cards, I've found that all the complaints are really moot. The cards are only about [money] more than other \"standard\" name brand cards, and worth it for the picture quality. Bottom line, if you're looking for a good camera that takes nice, sharp pictures for a good price, this is it. If you're looking for a professional camera, be prepared to pay professional prices. But this will certainly do very well for anyone who just wants to take nice pictures.","My daughter's wedding in Hawaii in Oct. 2002 was the biggest test so far for my 2650 Fuji Finepix. I shot over 140 Pics. (without once re-charging my 1700 mah batteries) in all kinds of lighting and didn't miss a shot. I was using a 128 MB smart media and I had plenty of space left for about 60 more shots. I take this camera on board my boat for my Salmon fishing trips both in winter and summer here on the Washington coast and the shots have all come out great. My son has a new Cannon G3 4MP and he can't believe that my camera takes better pictures than his. Buy it! You won't be sorry.","I have pretty mixed feelings about this camera. It's original raison d'etre it has fulfilled well - in transitioning my wife from 35mm to digital. it's small, reasonably light and as a 'point and shoot', obtains reasonable pictures.<br />However to diverge from automatic control is fiddly and slightly masked by an iconic menu system - where a word would save several pictures.<br />The manufacturer's offering of 16Mb card + 2 alkaline batteries is woefully inadequate - I'd prefer it came with no card and save a few pennies. 32Mb is adequate; 64 is good.<br />Realistically, it has to be used with rechargeable batteries - a charging circuit in the camera would be a good start.<br />The software is abysmal - both Mac and PC. The Webcam mode is useless and not available for Mac (no mention of this on the manufacturer's site); the 'fine pix' photoeditor is slow and painful (tip for mac users, just plug it in, copy the files over and use iphoto or graphics converter) - again save some money and don't even bother with the CD. Also the Mac version refused to load until a lot of weird tricks were done.<br />The xD cards are small and fast but are yet another standard which is incompatible with Smart Media, Sony Memory Stick, Compact Flash etc... Price seems reasonable.<br />Low light or indoor photographs are problematic using the automatic settings.<br />Overall not bad and an excellent 'starter' camera albeit with anoying limitations.","Im very happy with this camera. It takes outstanding pictures. The quality is great. I would recommend this camera to anyone.","It is a nice camera, just don't recommend for concert photos, nighttime photos, or pictures of items far away.  Disappointed with the clarity of the pictures.  An example: my husband and I tried to take a few pictures of some people, they were 6 feet away from the camera and it was so fuzzy that you could hardly see the face.  for the money we paid we could have gotten something better and more worth while.","I had to buy a camera on short notice, so I didn't have much time to shop around. However, I think this was one of the best choices I could have made.<br />The optical zoom is far better than the more common digital zooms offered on most cameras. Picture quality is great, and I think I can finally retire my old trusty 35mm SLR for most purposes. You can use the viewer or the LCD for lining up your shots, and I've gotten good results from both. You can pan and zoom the images stored on the memory card, to make sure the shot is good down to the pixel. Downloading pictures is easy, as with most modern cameras, and you can even set it up as a live camera for videoconferencing. The \"xD\" memory cards are *tiny* little things - I hope they don't get much smaller to this or they'll be too easy to loose - and the 128MB card will hold 200+ 1600x1200 \"fine-quality\" pictures.<br />What are it's weaknesses? It does not perform quite as well in low-light as I expected it to, and because of it's small size and low weight it is not easy to hold still - but with the flash on it is better than most cameras I've seen. For most people, this is probably only a problem when using the video mode and the webcam mode, where it cannot use the flash. The odd way of having to open the sliding lens cover *and* turn on the camera is taking some time to get used to. The menus are rather odd but not too hard to learn. The memory cards are unique to only a few camera brands, so they may be more expensive than others; and lastly, it loads into the camera in the battery compartment, which I thought was an odd placement.<br />It's by no means the best digital camera money can buy, but for the price point, I think this is the best value I've seen.","I always wanted to have a little camera that fits in my pocket (or knapsack) that goes everywhere.. my SLR is always a production to drag around... so this is the answer to being able to snap that beautiful cloud formation or sunset on the spur of the moment..  I love the fact that it only takes 2 batteries.  I have read other people's reviews about it eating batteries, but heck, maybe I just don't leave it on except to snap the pix after I line up the shot, so haven't had that problem yet.  I did get the 128 card, probably because I know what it is to run out of film on my SLR camera, and then find a gorgeous shot - that ended up missed, but I have yet to fill up this card.. maybe when I do a long holiday trip.. This is fun for quick shots (you can even do a self portrait real easy) to send to friends in emails (yes, this is me now with orange hair!)..  The cable to download to computer comes with camera.  Do get the adapter (to plug in for power - esp good for re-viewing what you shot, and for downloading).  I lamented not findin one in stores I knew of... then looked on the fuji.com website.. man, you can find supplies worldwide! I found the adapter at a dinky little foto shop in a little strip mall that's almost on my way home from work.. so do get it - well worthwhile... :) have fun!","I got the camera by accident but have been very happy with it.  Granted 2 megapixels is not a lot these days, but is adequate for most everyday photos, and you can print good 6\" by 4\" prints.  (I use an Epson inkjet printer and the results are very gratifying.)  The image quality exceeded my expectations.  As with other Fuji products, it's well made and packaged.","I bought my Finepix 2650 before Christmas 2002 so I could have a small camera instead of lugging around my SLR and bags of equipment.  I didn't expect great shots from an inexpensive, pocket-sized camera, but WOW, I was truely amazed at the great results.  The 2650 blows away my Canon Elan IIe for consistantly good color balance and overall image quality.<br />Is it the perfect digital camera?  No, but it's about the best you'll find in this price range and even among those costing a couple of hundred more.  It's packed with features and I've experienced zero problems in the 4 months I've owned it.<br />Pros:<br />*Great overall image quality<br />*Small but not too small<br />*Good selection of picture modes<br />*Accurate focus<br />*MP3 movies (no sound)<br />*XD picture card<br />*Good battery life<br />Cons:<br />*Menu (you have to surf to find what your looking for and memorize the symbols since it doesn't give text descriptions)<br />*Somewhat slow shutter speed (set to the equivalent of 100 asa 35mm film)<br />*Crummy, ad-filled software (if you have XP don't even bother installing it)<br />After experimenting with several of the modes available, I'm happy to leave it in full-auto which gives great reults for 98% of my shots, indoor and out.  I haven't even used my SLR since buying the Fuji.  The zoom lense is adequate except for extreme long range shots (but how many people own 500mm lenses for their SLRs anyway?)  For anyone who complains about weak flash - the flash is as good as any in a small camera, it won't illuminate a stadium, but it's not meant to.<br />Last but not least, the XD picture card.  Yes it's proprietary and currently only Fuji and Olympus use it.  It's extremely fast, amazingly small, works well and is not over-priced compared to other media.  I dare-say anyone who has a complaint about proprietary issues hasn't changed an ink cartidge in their printer and probably still uses floppy-discs for their primary data storage.<br />Great Job Fuji !!!","Great pics, excellent features, user friendly and [doesn't cost a lot]. I knew nothing about using a digital camera and I was taking pics in a matter of minutes after taking the camera out of the box. I had no problem getting the pics from the cam to the computer. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the pics. I couldn't be more pleased with this camera. I really like having the option of the optical zoom. The movie setting is a nice bonus and I've made some great short clips of the kids in action. My only recommendation is to buy some rechargable batteries because once you get this camera you will be taking pics of everything and everyone. :)","Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra de la cámara digital Fuji FinePix 2650, tiene excelente resolución en las fotos, se puede tomar video sin sonido, el precio fue excelente, la entrega muy pronta y segura. Recomiendo a otros la compra de este producto, muy útil para fines familiares y de trabajo, el tamaño es perfecto.","For the price, this is a good camera.  It may be one of the better deals among 2.0 mega-pixel cameras right now.  That said, there are a few issues to be aware of:<br /> - Manual controls are only available through the menu system.  They are simple to get to, but get turned off when the camera is turned off.<br /> - Barrel distortion can be an issue at its widest angle (the default), but zooming in on your subject a little will eliminate the problem.<br /> - The plastic construction gives it a \"cheap\" feel, but it is not flimsy and doesn't seem like it will fall apart<br /> - The boxy dimensions make the camera feel awkward at first.  With a little use, it became quite comfortable to use.<br /> - The viewfinder is not as accurate as the LCD.  It doesn't show some of the picture.  This can be especially annoying with group photos. You'll probably want to setup shots using the LCD most times, but this can be difficult in direct sun light.<br /> - The camera takes 2 AA batteries which will probably not last as long as your trip.  I recommend getting some re-chargeable NiMH batteries.  Target had a reasonably priced set of 4 with charger.<br /> - The included memory card is only good enough for about 20 of the highest quality pictures so you'll want to get a 128M xD card.<br />Despite these limitations, I have been quite happy with this camera.  I was looking for a 4 megapixel camera that could do everything I wanted (low-light photog, manual controls, noise correction, etc.) at a reasonable price.  When I finally gave up my search, I bought this camera to use while waiting for my \"dream\" camera.  It may not have all the features I wanted, but it will make the wait easier.","Bought this cam for a gift and bought one for myself after seeing the quality...<br />I agree the Fuji software is a bit complicated but Win XP or ME will download with out using the software. I just plug in the cam and XP transfers with no problems.<br />I compared this cam with the Canon Elph and chose the Fuji for its simple controls. Yes the Elph has a metal case but I felt it was too small and heavy, and the buttons are tiny. (there is a reason cars now use plastic for bumpers instead of metal) also Elph doesnt have 3X optical Zoom.<br />Complaints about price of XD cards are silly; 256MB card for$110... Thats 400 hi res shots or 1952 lo res. Great travel cam.<br />Doesnt come with an AC adapter ... I can live with that.<br />This is a great cam with quality Fuji lens. You will be amazed how easy it is to take a great pic.....","The Fujifilm Finepix 2650 is a great camera.  It is perfect for beginning digital photographers because everything you need is included.  The picture quality is very good--on the two mp fine setting you can pring out photo quality pictures at over 8x10\" in size. I am very satisfied with this camera and also recommend the HP Deskjet 5550 Color inkjet printer.","I finally took the digital plunge and bought the Finepix 2650.<br />This camera is nearly everything I wanted in a digital camera.<br />The software loads and works with ease.  The pictures are very good even in the lowest resolution.  The colors are very natural.  The price was affordable.  As a place to get started in digital photography this is a good choice.  I would suggest resisting the urge to buy a larger picture card with the initial purchase of the camera.  I thought about it and am glad I didn't because the 16MB picture card that is included will hold 25 pictures at the highest resolution and 122 at the lowest.  Once you download to your computer you can erase the pictures individually or collectively from the card and go on taking pictures.  I would wait until you really find you need more picture capacity and instead spend that money on recharchable Ni-MH AA batteries.  I bought the Olympus batteries and they work fine.  I found a Fugi vinyl camera case.  Over all a modest total investment for a camera this good.","If not for the weak flash this camera would be a 5 star camera. Pictures are too dark when shooting at night. Everything that is further than a couple of feet is almost invisible. Great camera for the daylight use.","This camera combines 3 qualities you will not find in any other camera:great pictures, low price, and unsurpassed ergonomics.<br />It can be operated easily with one hand; it slips easily into a breast pocket; it is laid out in a rational way.<br />There are times indoors when there is not enough light for non-flash photography with this cam, but that is true of most cams.<br />I would not own any other camera.","I am over all impressed with this camera.  It does decent distant shots and decent close up shots.  I have had a few lighting problems but rarely.","Oh, and I forgot to add: The time it takes after each picture is so frustrating!! After I've taken a picture, people always ask me if batteries died. grgg! sO IF YOU ARE AS IMPATIENT WITH TECHNOLOGY  as I am, spend a few extra $$ (or get your parents to) on a camera that has light speed recoveries and zooms. Otherwise it will seem like you are manually rewinding a camera. (like you do with disposables or pro 35mms)<br />I give this 3 stars mainly because I like the pictures I took. They came out great.","I wanted to upgrade from the HP PhotoSmart 210 (which was big, only held 4 megs and was almost always blurry) when we took a trip across country and I found myself deleting pictures of friends and family to take one of something else I made up my mind that I had to have a new camera. I looked a long time at cameras before I got this one. Over all I am very pleased with it.<br />Good stuff-<br />*the price (I used bizrate.com and found this to me the lowest price of the places I had heard of) vs. other similar cameras<br />*clear pictures without a tripod<br />*expandable memory<br />*rechargeable AA battery compatible<br />*lcd for previewing pictures can zoom in on pictures<br />*web cam mode (make sure the room is well lit)<br />*many settings like picture size, flash, micro, and self timer<br />*long instructions with every feature clearly explained and tips on using different settings to get better pictures.<br />Bad Stuff-<br />*JUNK software, but I just plugged in the usb cable and winme detected it no problem and I used the cd to add the drivers. Then I added a folder to the desktop that is on my computer D:\\DCIM\\100_FUJI and all I do is open up the folder and there are my pictures and movies, so no need to even install the junk.<br />*no ac adapter included (so when you first get it, say as a gift or something, and those batteries run out (mine were gone in no time) that's it, no more fun until you sink even more $ into it)<br />*rechargeable batteries and charger not included<br />*no camera case included (but the lense cover helps)<br />*poor quality movies with no sound (avi file type with two sizes to choose from)<br />*small memory card included (but I can get to my computer often so I don't need a bigger one yet)<br />*hard to see lcd in low light<br />The good stuff more than out weighs the bad stuff if price is a consideration, but I just couldn't get past that useless, junk software or the lack of ac adapter to give it five stars, still I wouldn't trade it in for another.","Ugh, When I asked for a digital camera I had precise expectations. Being a bit technology impateint I wanted:<br />-Something easy. (it is fairly easy)<br />-Something Small, to place in a bag or whatnot. (It is bulky)<br />-Something with a clear bright screen. (I have yet to use the screen once, it is so dark. Normally the screen is a major plus to the digital, but I still find myself looking through the small hole with this cam.)<br />-Far Far zoom. I like catching things at a distance and taking pictures of crushes without them noticing me. (ok it has a pretty good zoom. I can take pictures of people down the school hall way. But thats unlikely to happen with any digi cam...)<br />-Something I can hook up to the computor AND the tv. (my friend Czarine has a cam that does this, but it's from china so couldn't get that kind. Anyway, I have yet to hook it up to a tv, if possible... And you can only hook it up to the computor using the camera. The memory card has no adaptor thing)<br />-Something convenent. (this is highly the opposite. It has a specific memory card that only certain cameras use! And it's expensive cards......wow.....Was I disapointed when I found this out)<br />-quality pictures. (Yeah the pictures are very good once they are uploaded. I am satisfied)<br />In conclsuion.... My mad sad parents scammed me on my christmas needs. (they did this with the mp3 player that doesn't work either. It is anything but easy. they are just poor quality people)<br />I think the screen display color and memory card situation are the biggest set backs. They ... me off.<br />It is an inexpensive camera, yeah probably the most inexpensive. So that's good...<br />***Cool thing***<br />with the flash off, spin/shake the camera and you'll have a cool motion effect. Also, you can take cool pictures with a black light. Use the motion effect with the black light and it looks quite fab.","This is my first digital camera.  I bought it because it came highly recommended from CNET.com.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend buying the rechargeable batteries. Like most digital cameras, it EATS AA batteries. :) You can buy the rechargeable batteries and charger right from Amazon.com as well. There are different brands available. You can see what's available under accessories.<br /><br />Camera does everything it says in the description. Takes WONDERFUL pictures!<br /><br />Great price...cheaper here then I have seen at other places.<br /><br />It is verrrrry easy to operate...not a lot of bells and whistles that you will probably never use. You can zoom in on your subject reallllly close and still have a high quality picture.<br /><br />The program to upload pictures to your computer is also verrrrry easy to understand and use.<br /><br />There is a few seconds lapse in time from being able to take one picture and then another. Maybe that is standard on all digital cameras...I don't know. The time lapse isn't a big deal to me though. It would only affect me if I was trying to shoot action shots.<br /><br />There is no chance of taking a picture with the cover on...you will get a message that your cover is still on. :) It is light and compact. I am just amazed at what a great camera this is!<br /><br />100% satisfied! ...","I debated for a long time whether to purchase a digital camera. I don't take a lot of pictures, but the deal I received with this camera was too good to pass up. I've taken pictures through our french doors to our bird feeder and the results are amazing. In fact, those pictures (printed with the Canon s820 printer, but that's another review!) are hanging on the wall in our sun room as we write. It took a little while to figure out the correct settings to use (but since there is no film to waste and no development waiting time that's a breeze), but once that was determined, the results are fantastic. I recommend this camera to the \"average\" photographer. I can't believe I waited so long!","I recieved this digital camera for my 16th birthday...i actually just got it yesterday and am planning to use it before my party tomorrow...I find it a great camera although I have only taken about 6 pictures with it so far.  It's really light wieght and easy to carry around...of course this digital camera cannot compare with other ones out there... of course this review is being written by a teenager, so wiser people may want to check out the other cameras - However it is a really great camera to use for people who just like to take simple pictures...don't expect to become a professional photographer on this one!  Great for the money, love the digital display!  It's a great camera for a teen!","This is our first digital camera and we're very pleased.  It has a variety of easy-to-use features for taking pictures, as well as reviewing them via the camera.  The screen is good quality, the controls are easy to learn/use and we haven't experienced any trouble with the battery power.  The best part was using the camera with our computer.  It is truly plug-and-play.","I purchased a Fuji 2650 camera after doing some research.It is a good buy for the price.I was told that indoor pictures are not good. But I got very good pictures. Only surprise was that battery low indicator came unexpectedly when you were not expecting it. So rechargeable battery may be a solution. It is only 4 days since I got it so I would be in a position to give more feedback after some time.","Well it's easy to review this digicam. For those who whants an easy to use and EASY to PAY digicam this is the rightone! Easy shoots and easy controls.<br />The 4x6 prints are great and also de 8x10 using ofoto.com service.<br />The software is trash! You can get a better one for free in the web. The software ofoto offers for free its great for organizing the pics and also pctocam software is a good one for organizing the lots of photos you'll will shot.<br />The only complain about this camera is that the pccam operation is useless is you don't put a 100watts lamp in front of you, either the image is totally dark.","This is really a great camera. I use rechargeable batteries and I'm still on the first charge! I have taken about 125 pictures using the flash 90% of the time. Also loaded pics to my PC numerous times (I do not have the optional adaptor) and the batteries still have much life left in them.<br />I feel that the picture quality is excellent.<br />I have no negative statements to make about this camera. It does all that I expected from it and then some.<br />Overall I am very happy with this purchase.","I wanted a nice, inexpensive digital camera and purchased the FinePix 2650 during a ShopAtHome promo. I paid $...plus s/h for it. Even tho' I paid $... more than here at Amazon, I'm still happy with the camera. Nice clear photos, even in 8x10. I would suggest purchasing a battery charger or carry along a few extra batteries if you're going to be using the LCD for most of your photography. It's compact and fairly simple to use.","I have the 2600 model, which looks and functions somewhat the same... It certainly isn't the coolest looking thing around and is kinda bulky (like me). But still, the price and image quality is fantastic. And like it's name, it really does take some Fine Pix.","for a small 2 megapixel camera this is a great buy. good pictures right out of the box.","I have had different digital cameras in my time but this camera far exceeds any camera i had before. I have even paid 1000 dollars for a professional digital camera before and it still wasn't as good as this camera. And for the price that amazon.com is selling it for is rarely even heard of. So the bottom line is take my advice and buy this camera you won't be sorry.","I own a FinePix 2600, the predecessor to the 2650. They look identical, and as far as I can tell the only differences are:<br />A) The 2600 uses SmartMedia memory, while the 2650 uses xD;<br />B) The 2600 comes with 2 NiMH batteries and a pocket-sized charger, and the 2650 does not;<br />C) The 2600 has a slightly larger LCD display window.<br />That said, I love the features, intuitive controls and photo quality of the 2600 and have no doubt the 2650 is comparable. I plug it into my iMac's USB port and voila, the images are in a folder on the desktop. I don't even bother with the rudimentary Fujifilm software; I Photoshop the images and I'm good to go.<br />If you're leaning toward a 2650, check out the 2600 for the extra accessories. ...","It's an awesome little camera, I was surprised at all the features you get for the price.  I told my husband that I wanted a digital camera for Xmas (and not to spend too much$$$) I wasn't expecting something this great!<br />I went back to the store and got the 128bit picture card, little bit of sticker shock there :o  But it will be worth it because now instead of 27 pics I have enough memory to take 398.","I purchased this camera as an early christmas gift for myself and couldn't be happier!  Not only is the picture quality great, but it's so easy to use.  My pictures look just as great as the ones I take with my 35mm, but now, I never have to develop a bad picture ever again!  And you can't beat the price!<br />If you've considered buying a digital camera but didn't want to pay too much for a decent one, this is the camera to buy.  It may not be top of the line, but it's great for everyday photos.","I took a few photos with this little gem, and I have to say I was suprised. Performance is ahead of price. Highly recommended. And unlike one of the previous reviewer said, you don't need the ac adapter to make this a webcam.","After looking around for a while, I decided on the Fuji 2650.  I am really impressed with the quality of the pictures!  I compared it to the Olympus and Canon same quality models, and the Fuji won hands down.  The Fuji, although slightly bulkier, is sturdier.  I accidently dropped it, to my horror, within a couple hours of opening it and it didn't phase the camera.  I did have to adjust the brightness level for the LCD screen to display pictures properly. But once I got it, the display is beautiful.  The pictures downloaded seamlessly to my computer and again, the quality is magnificent. However, I am a little upset that I have to buy an adapter to use my memory card with my printer.  I wish it was standardized.  I didn't know I was going to have to buy an adapter when I got my new photo-printer, but the Fuji xD memory card will not fit in the slot properly nor in most other photo printers unless there is an adaptor.  A very big inconvience and when you are trying to save money but later find you have to buy adapters to make peripherals work, the low price of the camera isn't so low anymore.  However, you can print from via computer to printer.  I just wanted the ease of printing from my camera to the printer.  The movie feature is just fun.  It's not professional and no audio.  But if you want a simple little video, it works fine.  The major drawback is that you can't use the flash when you are recording a video.  If you are recording a video in low-light, the quality is rather grainy.<br />PROS:<br />*Wonderful quality pictures<br />*Easy to set-up<br />*Sturdy camera<br />*LCD displays pictures crisp and with good color<br />*Nice features included (manual and auto modes, movie option)<br />*Holds good amount of photos.<br />*QUALITY OF PICTURES IS GREAT!<br />Cons:<br />*Wish there was the option to use the flash while using the movie feature (if there is an option, I haven't figured it out).<br />*Goes through batteries.  The batteries included were used up in a matter of 2 hours.  I hope newer batteries last a bit longer.<br />*Long delay (about 3-4 seconds) between pictures.  If you need to take shots in quick succession either find another camera or use the movie mode.<br />*LCD doesn't display images in dim environments very well.  Once picture is taken and then viewed, it's much better.<br />Overall, the quality of the photos makes this camera worthwhile, not to mention the ease of available functions. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a reliable, good quality and inexpensive camera.","After purchasing this camera, I compared the photos with that of a friends that costs over twice as much.  In my opinion, the quality was as good, if not better than the other camera.<br />The camera was very easy to operate as well.  I am very pleased with it, and would highly recommend it.","It's user-friendly and captures all of those special moments with precision and clarity.  Perfect for the beginner!","I've only had this for a couple days now but the image quality is great for the price.  1600x1200 with 3x optical zoom gets quite close to the subject, with great clarity.  The movie mode is hardly useful at 320x200 without audio, but I consider that a teaser anyway.  Still mode allows auto or manual white balance and EV compensation options; macro mode as near as 4 inches (Limited to 1MP and no zoom) - great for product displays on a website.  Colors were great with automatic modes - even rose quartz and gemstones have just the right luster.  Magnolia Magic can now show the true colors of its product line.  I can't wait to get new pictures made and on the website.<br />Only drawback would be battery consumption - trust me, you'll need NiMH rechargeables and a fast charger... I managed to drain the first pair of alkalines in 3 hours of playing with my new toy.  Running on only two AA's keeps it light, though, at only 8.5 oz.  In all, a great camera for personal or small business use.","After owning two Olympus digital cameras, I thought I'd try a Fuji to compare optics and image quality.  Right out of the box, I noticed the bulky size of the camera.  I have an Olympus 520 which is really compact and easily fits into a pocket.  The Fuji is twice as thick, and barely fits into a pocket.  The built-in flash is great, and has a really fast recharge time while using only 2 AA batteries.  The only downside to the camera is the proprietary XD memory cards-- sorry compact flash users, you can't use them with the Fuji.  On the plus side, the menu functions are easy to use.  What makes this camera really stand out is the optics.  Fuji has really outdown themselves with these quality optics.  In a side-by-side comparison, I took the same photos of both the Olympus 520 and Fuji-- the Olympus images were slightly out of focus and images were almost consistantly washed out and bland.  The Fuji had remarkable images, crisp autofocus, and vibrant colors.  The Fuji wins hands-down in this image comparison.  Too bad it's bulky and uses the XD memory card.","I've been very pleased with this camera.  It's very simple to operate, and takes beautiful pictures,  which can be uploaded to the computer simply by plugging the camera into a USB port and clicking on the camera's directory in \"My Computer.\"  The zoom works well, and it has some nice features like the self-timer.<br />There are some drawbacks.  There's a small but sometimes significant delay between pressing the button and the shot being taken, and the camera does take quite a few seconds to recharge between shots--longer, it seems, than with a conventional camera, especially if you've set the camera to take more detailed, memory-intensive, shots.  I gather these are features of comparable digital cameras, however, so I wouldn't want to unfairly single out the 2650.<br />The soundless video capability is really just a novelty, albeit quite a fun one.<br />Still, a lovely camera and great value.","This is a great first camera for digital camera novices like me.  As a web designer and technology geek, I was looking for something that was easy to use and inexpensive, with all the bells and whistles.  This one fit perfectly.<br />The easy to use interface lets even a keyboard jockey like me navigate the 12 or so basic functions.  The 2 Mega pixel resolution prints great in color and decent rough copies on my laser printer.  It takes great shots for the web.  I loved the lens protector and the easy to access battery/memory compartment.<br />I have taken about 50-60 pictures on my first set of batteries using the flash for most of them.  I have yet to fill my free 32MB memory card. I took 3 twenty second video clips and that wasn't even half full.<br />There was quite a bit of lag from when you push the button fully and the shutter snaps.  This is easily overcome.  I also would have liked it to display the picture for a little longer after the shot is taken.  It only stays up for a second or two and you have to change modes to view it again.  The easy to use buttons make this easy enough to do.<br />Overall Highly Recommended","My first digital camera, and I am very impressed with the ease of use, and the picture quality.  Many features not found on cameras of this price range.  I really love the optical zoom.  If I had to find a fault, it is with the door for the battery compartment...the latch is a little cheesy, and can come open if you are not careful.  Not a major defect, but something to be aware of.  I would highly reccomend this camera.","I got this camera for Christmas.  The instructions were easy to follow, making setup and use a breeze.  Installation of the software and downloading the pics to the PC all went without a hitch.  This is a great buy for anyone who has little or no experience with digital cameras.","First of all, this camera is an excellent value (performance & features vs price). The quality is apparent from the first moment you see the box, when it becomes clear that Fuji put a lot of effort into designing this product. This camera also has several advantages over other brands at similar prices. The most obvious advantage is that this camera uses the new xD picture cards; and these little fellas are really neat. If you ever watched the original Star Trek, you know that Starfleet around that time stored its portable data on small cartridges. xD cards are like that but much, much smaller; sort of like a thumbnail size wafer, which you can slip in the coin pocket of your blue jeans; so small, that these xD cards are suitable for use by James Bond on one of his secret missions; and they are durable, too. When I shopped for other digital cameras, it became obvious that xD cards are the latest and finest technology, and they use much less power too (and that's important when you're dealing with a portable digi-cam). The other advantage of the 2650 is that unlike similarly-priced models, it has a digital AND 3x optical zoom. First I looked at an Olympus, a fine outfit, but for the same price I got this Fuji with the optical zoom; usually a feature only on the more expensive models. I'm happy also with the compatibility of the Fuji digital software with my Windows PC. Fuji has a marketing agreement with Microsoft (I'm a big supporter of MS, because I LIKE to be able to have all my software working together), and my dreaded installation of the included Finepix 3.2a software CD-ROM went very smoothly. After you install the included software, which is quite easy, it is really a cinch to download pictures. You simply connect the included USB cable to your camera port, and your PC and Fuji camera automatically take over; the Finepix Picture Viewer pops up on your screen, and you're in business. You don't even have to \"download\" your pictures, they automatically synch right into the PC viewer, and then you can simply select the ones you want to save to your hard drive (the Finepix software also works on Mac's for all you Apple geeks [get in touch with your dark side--try a PC.]). The operation of this Fuji 2650 camera is also elegant and efficient. Remember, this camera is relatively inexpensive for 2 megapixels & an optical zoom; but you sacrifice nothing in terms of performance. The user interface and menu is so intuitive I was using this camera before having read the instruction manual (I still have not read it, just a few paragraphs from the software installation section), and a \"QuickStart\" foldout guide comes with the instruction booklet, so I was taking pictures within minutes (The people at Fuji Japan are obviously very sharp). The LCD screen on the back of the camera is adequate, and doesn't seem to use up my batteries too quickly. I want to make a few suggestions to you if you're interested in buying this camera: First of all, go to the Fuji-USA website and you can take their interactive tour of the camera (this alone will sell you); when you buy this 2650 model, make sure you purchase a genuine Fuji 3V AC adapter (digi-cams can drain batteries away faster than politicians can find new ways to tax us) which is available from Fuji on their website (I hope Amazon.com decides to stock this item); also, I purchased the Fuji-brand accessory package for the 2650, which includes a very fine Panasonic recharger and set of 4 top-of-the-line Panasonic NIMH rechargeable batteries (better than NiCad), a mini-tripod, a genuine Fuji padded soft camera case (it's worth it just for the charger and batteries), and also a complimentary copy of Microsoft Picture It! 2002 Express (although all you really need is the excellent Fuji Finepix software). Now, I want to ask you, unless you're a professional photographer, why would you need something more expensive (and more complicated) than this Fuji 2650? I know I sound like some spokesman for Fuji, but I'm not (look me up on my Amazon profile). I simply appreciate it when a company designs a beautiful, integrated product and sells it at a great price. This is somewhat akin to choosing between a Toyota Camry and a Jaguar XJ-S; with the Jag, you will be paying 300% more for a car you have to endlessly worry about, take care of, and constantly repair and protect, not to mention learn how to use all the advanced gizmos; with the Toyota, you're buying a car which is fun, nicely designed, practical, and solidly built. My Fuji 2650 pictures are great, even at the lowest resolution. I bought this camera for a specific purpose (posting pictures on internet dating sites) and so far I am scoring with the great photos (and the ladies too:)--relax, I am just trying to amuse you); but this camera will do very well for you no matter your purpose. You don't need 6 Megapixels and a 10x optical zoom, take the $500 you save buying this camera and buy a good stock, or a present for your girlfriend or significant other. Good luck!","This is a terrific camera.  It is easy to use and makes you feel like a photo pro with the results.  Output is crisp with colors that are sharp and vivid.  The 16mb chip that comes with it is fine - will hold over 100 pics at lowest res for snapshots, but soon you will get the 128mb chip.  It gives almost 1000 pics at lowest res and over 300 pics at highest res.  You will find yourself taking far more pics than you ever did with 35mm.  Downloading to PC is a snap with the included software.  One feature I like is the Macro mode.  With this I was able to take closeups of flowers that were right-on focus and the colors made you want to reach out and touch it!  Get the rechargable NiMH batteries and you will be ready for any photo adventure.","This camera is awesome in comparison with the competition in the same spectrum. Considering cameras with 2MP, 3x optical zoom and LCD display, this one is hard to beat.<br />Many people may find the xD-Picture format of the storage to be a negative point, but it is blazingly fast and has an extraordinary form factor. Besides, it is backed by Fujifilm and Olympus, which guarantees that this format will not be a hard-to-find item or out of catalog before you decide to buy another camera for a different reason.","The Fuji finepix 2650 is a great camera for the price.<br /><br />You will be hard pressed to find another camera with 3x OPTICAL zoom and a video mode for that price. The detail at 2 megapixels is tremendous. You dont need more then 2 megapixels unless your a serious photographer. Two megapixels will print out an 8x10 photo with good quality.<br />You are able ,in the macro mode, to zoom in for fantastic detailed images. Its no exageration to say you can see the pores in your skin in the Macro mode better then if you were looking in the mirror. You can zoom in on an eye and it will fill your video monitor when loaded to the pc.<br /> It is very easy to use and the 16 megabyte card included is plenty for most people. Just plug the camera in using the included USB connection and they will load up automatically. From there you can use any software to enlarge ,crop or edit in the manner you choice.<br />Having not owned a digital camera prior to this one its hard to compare battery life however they seem to last plenty long enough for me. I purchased 4 rechargable batteries and a charger so I should not have a problem in that area. The new XD card is supposed to use less battery life then the older style sorage cards.<br />Only dissapointment would be in the video format. It does not do well in low light situations. If your indoors you will need bright light to get a decent video clip, outdoors in the sun its fine. Hint, you can use windows movie maker which is included with windows XP to join your clips and it also resaves your clip in the WMV format which compresses the video considerably for a much smaller file size with little video quality loss. This is ideal for e-mailing the clips.<br />I highly recomend this camera for anyone who loves to take pictures, beginners to pros.","This camera is packed with features for the price.  If you are looking for web pics and powerpoint, this is the camera for you.  The camera is simple to operate and the functions are useful and not a bunch of extras that no one really uses.  Definitely need to get rechargeable batteries, but they last quite awhile (2 AA).  The 20 second video clips are fun to play with, no sound.<br />My only complaint, the lens cover is easy to bump which automatically retracts the lens.  No big deal, though.","We (my wife an I) got a Fuji 2600 digicam last year for X-mas. The 2650 is the same camera but with the new XD storage card. We're pretty impressed with the quality of the camera and the features. The 3x optical zoom is one of the better features. To get that kind of zoom on a camera in this price range is rare. If you're looking for a camera, don't fall victim to the \"digital zoom\". Some manufacturers advertise a 3x zoom, but its of the digital variety, not optical. All the digital zoom does is make the pixels bigger. Optical zooms are like those on traditional film cameras.<br />There are two complaints we do have. The first is the battery life. It doesn't last very long when you're using the LCD as the viewer. To compensate you can use the manual viewfinder. Fortunately our camera came with the rechargeable batteries. The other problem we have seen is in the lens itself. It is not very high quality. On some pictures you can notice a little spherical curvature near the edges. Its not noticeable unless you have a straight line like a wall to use as a reference. But for a camera of this price, these quibbles are easily overlooked.<br />The Fujifilm 2600 and 2650 are great values in the digicam arena. They make great cameras for those just getting into the hobby. They have easy to use controls, come with a lot of extras and are relatively inexpensive.","This is our first digital camera, so we took our time to choose. Finally we decided that 2.0 megapixels should be enough for our needs: non-professional \"entry-level\" users.<br />We looked at many options, and when talking Price-Value the FinePix 2650 is really a bargain. A nice little camera packed with all the functions one could expect, very friendly and easy to operate. Even do it's a fully automated camera, all BUT focusing can be set to manual. And there is the flaw: under poor lighting conditions auto-focus usually fails.<br />Other than that we are very pleased: great colors, batteries are standard AA, fun to use.","This is way easier and more fun than I expected.  I was able to get started taking pictures as soon as the camera arrived, and despite being a techno-weinie I've been able to download pictures effortlessly to both my old home computer with windows 98 and my new office computer with windows xp. I use an slr film camera with an array of lenses, and I won't stop using that for serious photography.  But this camera is fun, instantly gratifying, takes amazingly good pictures, and all at a great price.","This camera is so easy to use and takes great pics. The only problem is the red-eye. We've always had this problem with our blue-eyed son. I can't count the number of snapshots that leave him looking like some sort of cute demon!<br />His red-eye problem is worse than ever with this camera. We took some shots at his brothers party the other day and he looks positively frightening! It (the red-eye monster) even affected my brown-eyed husband and daughter(we've never encountered problems there before). Any suggestions are appreciated!","As the webmaster of one of Alaska's most popular websites (Alaska Outdoor Journal) I finally decided to bite the bullet and move from scanning film photo prints to going digital for my website photo support. It was a move long overdue but with the rapidly advancing technology it was hard to pick a point in time to BUY (like computers). That has occurred with my purchase of the 2650 after a considerable amount of comparison shopping.<br />The sole reason for getting the 2650 was for my website support and so I was definitely looking for the best Price vs Features for under my $200 limit. I had decided that 2 megapixels was minimal resolution (1600x1200) to work with and that a very good Macro feature was a must have necessity.  I also wanted a true optical zoom in addition to a digital zoom. Lastly, I wanted at least some minimal Manual overrides on some of the settings for giving me some creative flexibility and artistic latitude. That?s a pretty tall order of features in this price range.<br />Most digital cameras under $200 rarely have an optical zoom so that feature eliminated many brands and models. The FinePix is 3x optical and 2x digital. The macro feature exceeded my expectations...focusing sharp as a tack at 3.9 inches from the subject. With the manual override of the White Balance set for incandescent bulb, I took perfect color-balanced pics of close subjects. Although the minimal f stop is 3.5, I took several photos in a darkened Safeway parking lot with no flash and was impressed with its low light ability down to 1/2 second exposure if you brace the camera or use a tripod. There is also an exposure compensation (EV) override which will allow you to adjust your exposure when the subject is in a bright backlit situation or the backdrop you want to shoot is darker than the foreground. The on-camera menu is VERY easy to use and remember what does what. I commend Fuji for this simple approach. The LCD was very sharp and clear with excellent color quality. The camera uses the latest technology memory chip, the xD Picture Card which is a variant of the SmartMedia technology and apparently this chip uses much less energy and will help conserve battery life. I believe a lot of cameras will be going to this energy saver chip in the near future. The 16mb card that comes with the camera stores 25 highest quality pics down to 122 photos at 640x480 for webpage quality which remains totally impressive. I bought an additional 64mb card which will store 4 times more than the 16mb. I?ll never run out of space for pics.  So far the camera appears to be very energy friendly on the Ni MH rechargeable batteries I installed. Ni MH rechargeables are highly recommended...check out the Rayovac ONE hour charger PS4-B which now comes with two power cables...one for wall socket and the other a cigarette lighter plug cable to charge your batteries on the road in your vehicle in one hour. No better value. Go with the Kodak 1850 maH high capacity rechargeable AA Ni MH for longest run time.<br />The software and camera is MAC and WinPC compatible using the USB port for connecting. The software automatically boots up when the computer senses the camera connection and power on. The program provides minimal editing control of the picture however. You can crop and resize but there is no brightness, color, saturation, etc. to adjust. Most users will have another graphics program they use to do these things anyway, like Photo Shop. You can run a slide show to review the entire camera contents or view pics individually. All the shot details are listed for each pic...f stop, shutter speed, date, time, file quality, etc. There is also a second program that is used to assemble a Photo Gallery collection to burn to CD or DVD and distribute to friends and family. You can also use this program to assemble a video clip gallery to burn to CD or DVD that you have taken with the FinePix 2650. These are pretty low res quality videos at 10 frames per second but you might have fun playing with this feature.<br />In the under $200 range I would rate this 5 stars.  In the 2 megapixel range I would rate this 4 stars. There is a camera that impressed me even more in the 2mp range, the Canon A40 which I compared side by side last night, but its running in the mid-$200 range on Amazon. My friend has it and the software has many additional features and capabilities and the camera is loaded with additional cool onboard things like 15 second time exposure, sepia and b&w settings, etc. and is Mac/PC compatible too.  BUT, for the best 2 megapixel entry level camera under $200 I would suggest the Fujifilm FinePix 2650; its a solidly built and very sturdy little camera. My only regret is Amazon dropped the price the day after I bought mine. Its a steal now at the new price.<br />Good shooting, -KK-","I have three digital cameras at this point. HP, Fuji, & Sony. Price/performance the 2650 wins hands down. For a point and shoot camera you can't beat it. I use my Sony DSC-S85 mostly but my wife uses the 2650 exclusively. The HP is in mothballs. Given the proper ambient light the image and coloration are dead on. Low light situations will throw it off but you can still get great shots if you work with the camera. Even the Sony with its illuminator can have some trouble in the dark. I use a cheap Canon i320 to print my pictures and I'm very satisfied with the results. I do use Adobe Photoshop 7 to edit my pictures on occasion. Great software will save a number of lesser quality pictures.","I bought this camera with the idea in mind of just taking average pics of friends and what not and it did it's job.  It's fairly simple to use both with taking pics and uploading on to your computer.  But if you're looking for spectacular quality you might want to spend a little more dough.","I bought this camera with the idea in mind of just taking average pics of friends and what not and it did it's job.  It's fairly simple to use both with taking pics and uploading on to your computer.  But if you're looking for spectacular quality you might want to spend a little more dough.","In my opinion it's simply the best Quality/Price rapport!!!","I agree with another review I read, \"Don't think, just buy it.\"  As an amateur photographer who owns Nikon, Petax's, etc., this has to be one of the best values ever.  I use it personally at home and for work.  It's small and takes good pictures.  I will probably never use a snap shot film camera again.  If you are looking for a good digital camera, at a decent price, consider this one.","The Fuji FinePix 2650 is an excellent choice for an economical digital camera.  For inside shots, it excels at portraits of two or three people but the flash has difficulty illuminating groups as small as half a dozen people.  Outside, using natural lighting,I have produced landscape photographs that are breathtaking in their sharpness and true color.  Even tricky light settings, such as snow cover, produced pictures that would make a professional proud. The 2 Megapixel photos look good even when printed as 8 x 10's.  However, if you like to crop pictures using photo software, you are somewhat limited in what you can achieve without loosing resolution.<br />I am very satisfied with battery life (especially if you avoid using the LCD to compose pictures).  If you are so inclined, a variety of manual settings are available through the LCD display, which are not difficult to master.  However, in bright sunlight, the LCD display is difficult if not impossible to read.  Used with a tripod, the manual settings provide good opportunities to be creative although the options do not directly simulate the controls of a SLR camera - that requires significantly greater investment in a digital camera.<br />The lens cover of this remarkably compact camera has a tendency to partially close while composing shots until you figure out the best way to grasp the camera - not a big concern except for the ham fisted.  The FinePix Viewer software works well for downloading pictures to the computer but I prefer Photoshop for editing pictures.  Many pictures should be \"auto level adjusted\" with photosoftware to get the best color and brightness, but this is easy to do and is probably required for photos from many kinds of digital cameras.<br />For the money, this is close to a 5 star camera; however, for those wanting more control over aperature, shutter speed, and \"film\" speed, a more expensive camera will be required.","I just bought it from amazon.com at a price of [money] dollars, free S/H and a free 32M XD card.<br />There are some minor disadvantages: poor movies & LCD in low light condition, but it's not primarily for movies & he view finder can be used in the low light condition instead of the LCD.<br />There are lots of advantages:<br />- great price for a camera w/ 2MP, 3x optical zoom<br />- xd card uses less batteries<br />- great, sharp pictures<br />- macro mode for close up pictures<br />- easy to use menu<br />- SOFTWARE (Imagemixer) TO CREATE SLICESHOW VCD DISK and you can play it on your DVD player. Similare software could cost you 25-40 dollars.  You can put several sliceshows in one single CD, each sliceshow can contain thoundsands of pictures.  I don't need a photo printer.  Just keep the pictures on CDs, watch them on TV, and print some of them at COSTCO only when needed.","My husband and I have been very happy with our Canon ELPH Advantix film camera for the past 3 years, but we've wanted to make the switch to digital for some time because the cost of film, developing and photos on disc is getting out of hand.  We've been waiting until prices came down enough that we could afford a digital camera that would have comparable print quality to a film camera.  We got the Fuji FinePix 2650 here at Amazon.com with a bonus 32MB memory card and free shipping, and we're really impressed with it.<br />The Fuji camera is just as small as the ELPH (though a bit thicker, probably due to the LCD screen).  Installing the software and hardware drivers to our Windows XP machine couldn't have been any easier, and uploading the pictures is as simple as plugging one end of the USB cable into the camera and plugging the other end into the PC---turn on the camera and the software starts automatically, loading thumbnails of all your pictures.<br />My husband was particularly interested in how well the camera would work in macro (ultra close-up) mode; you can't get any closer than about 4\" from the subject, but if you need to zoom even bigger you can do that on the PC after uploading the picture.  I had the camera set for highest resolution, optical zoom, macro mode, and I was able to zoom in to about 300% on the uploaded picture before I noticed any deterioration in the image.<br />Because we were also concerned about getting picture quality that would be comparable to our ELPH, I did a test by taking a picture of our baby at a distance of about 2 feet, then I uploaded the picture to the PC and zoomed in on the baby's face to fill an entire 8 1/2 x 11\" sheet; on our color inkjet, using normal paper, the picture quality was excellent.  The picture came out clear and crisp, and our more typical 4x6 prints should be even better---I'll bet that if I print them on photo paper they'll be indistinguishable from regular photos.<br />I tested the camera indoors in low light, indoors in medium light, and outdoors in sunlight, and the pictures came out great in all three settings.  The LCD screen doesn't work in low light conditions, but there's a regular viewfinder too so I just used that and then looked at the picture after it was taken.  I really like being able to immediately see whether or not the picture came out, and being able to immediately delete it if I'm not happy with it.  You can even zoom in on the stored image in the LCD viewfinder of the camera to confirm that the picture is totally in focus before deciding to keep it or delete it.  No more paying to develop bad pictures!!<br />The 32MB card holds 50 pictures on the highest resolution setting, and the camera comes with a 16MB card that holds 25 pictures at the highest resolution setting.  These cards are a little bigger than a penny and can be stored (with pictures on them) outside of the camera until you're ready to upload to the PC.  So when one card gets full, we'll just pop in the other one.  And of course, the cards can be erased and re-used over and over again, so I doubt we'll ever need to buy any more memory for this camera.  Even on vacation, I doubt we took 75 photos that were 'keepers'.<br />The camera also has a full-motion video feature, and it can be used as a webcam too.  I doubt we'll use the full-motion video since we already have a digital videocam, but the webcam feature will be handy for those cyber-visits with distant relations.<br />At a [low cost], this camera will pay for itself in film, developing and photo discs within about 6 months in our home (we have kids, so we take a lot of pictures).  I recommend this camera very highly; if you've been waiting to make the switch, it's time!","This is an excellent 2 megapixel digital camera. I have had it for a few days, and I am very impressed with it. The quality is excellent; I can print large pictures without having them pixelated. After the picture is taken, you can pan and zoom into different parts of the picture, directly from the camera. The included software makes saving and printing your pictures simpler than ever. It is very easy to adjust the flash settings in different lighting conditions; the camera can do this, but I like to adjust the settings to make the picture the way I like it. The camera uses XD memory, not to be confused with SD. XD memory is a fairly new technology and is not compatable with most printers that print directly from the card. However, unless you have a printer that prints directly from a memory card this is not a problem. Overall, this is a great camera that I thoroughly enjoy. This would make a perfect gift for the techno-geek or shutter-bug on your Christmas list.","I had been shopping for a digital camera for a long time. I came across the Fuji Finepix 2650 and saw how great a bargain it was. It has a 3x Optical Zoom, 2 megapixels, and is light and compact. The pictures it takes are excellent quality. I can't tell the difference between those pictures and pictures taken by a regular film camera. If you want to print pictures that are 11 x 14 or larger you might want to consider a 3 or 4 megapixel camera, but for 8 x 10 and smaller this camera does just fine. If you are looking for a great buy on a great digital camera, this is it.","I have recently purchased the Finepix 2650.  I am very impressed with its image quality.  A friend borrowed it and took some terrific pictures with it as well.  With a 3X optical zoom and 2MP CCD this camera is a great bargain.<br />It does have some drawbacks.  The LCD is hard to see in low light conditions.  The plastic case feels cheap.  The menus are initially tricky to learn, but once learned they do not seem too difficult.  I recommend this camera for those looking for a good digital snapshot camera.","Brief and to-the-point:<br />- Great value (sub $200)for 2MP with 20sec movie, 3X zoom, and more memory than most. Features compare very favorable among other similar cameras.<br />- Cannot see anything in a dark restaurant, club, etc.. Basically, I aim and click. If the pic doesn't come out right, I re-take it -- so far, not a huge deal.<br />- A little bulky, so if you plan to carry it around alot, it won't fit in your pocket.<br />All in all, a great cheap camera for taking fun pictures.","After four weeks of looking at Digital Cameras, and geting as much information, I decided to buy a FujiFilm FinePix 2650 Digital Camera. I took it out of the box read the directions, Down loaded the software, and I was taking pictures. I down loaded the pictures,printed them out on photo paper, and they were perfect. What more could any one want from a camera at this price. If you are wondering what amount of pixels to get in a digital camera, the manager of one camera shop told me that for the normal person shooting home photographs and not blowing them up past 8X10 you need no more than the 2650. After using it and down loading pictures, sending them by mail and printing them and everything coming out perfect, there is no other camera needed. I have also wrote a review on Epions.com if you need more information on this camera, and it works perfect with XP.","My wife and I decided to get a digital camera.<br />Because I'm a techno-head Art Director, not just any camera would do and the price had to be right. Plus, it had to be loaded with enough features to justify the purchase. I really wanted at least a 4.0 mega pixel but after discussing it over with my wife, we figured a 2.0 would do exactly what we wanted:<br />1. Instant digital gratification.<br />2. Excellent for e-mail shots and iPhoto.<br />3. The possibility of printing higher res shots.<br />It takes great color shots right out of the box. Extremely intuitive. The optical zoom eliminates bitmapping (jaggies) when close-up. And the auto-focus mode is idiot proof. It has 5 flash modes for lots of shooting customization. Macro (close-up 3.9\" to 2.6') and self-timer photography add to the host of features. White Balance (for light sources), Exposure Compensation and Movie (no sound video) mode round off this great little camera.<br />Check out the fujifilm.com sight for a great interactive preview. It's what really sold me. The purchase is up to you from there. The only other option in the same category was an Olympus, but the memory card was only 8mb, as was the Sony which only had its body-style going for it.<br />Good luck!","I bought this camera for 230$ which included a free 32mb smart card.  This camera has very good detail for a 2mp camera.  It also has a movie mode, which i used and it was cool, but still does not take the place of a good video recorder.<br />I once went to mexico and took a picture of a famous place, i also had the same picture in a travel book.  When i came home and printed it out on my hp printer, it was picture quality, flawless.<br />It does however have a tough time with movement.  I mostly take picture of pet fish, and they do not move that fast, but i find it very hard.  I find myself tweeking each little ajustment to get it just right, and I CAN get a good picture, but it does take a good deal of work to acheaive it.<br />It has a lot of nice features for under 200$ now, and i would recomend it to anyone who likes to take still photographs.<br />Note: Many people say the LCD screen is hard to see in the dark, which it is, but if you turn up the lcd brightness to its top setting it is ok.<br />~hope this helps","I am really enjoying my camera. I find it easy to go through the menus and pick my options. Takes great pictures. A really great camera especially for first time buyers. I like that it has optical zoom but it does start to get a bit grainy when you zoom in all the way. The macro feature that lets you get REALLY close up pictures works great. The sliding camera lense cover is great, you won't ever lose it. It only needs two batteries, but you better get rechargables and a larger memory card, as with any digital camera.","I live in Australia, my sister lives in BC Canada, I tried to purchase this camera for her christmas and the supplier wont ship to her address. Really top Service NOT>","y wife and I decided to get a digital camera...<br />Because I'm a techno-head Art Director, not just any camera would do and the price had to be right.

The pixels are great for any begginers. But one problem is that the lens covers sometimes slips to cover the lens.<br />Great Camera w/ Great Features!","I am a 35mm Canon junkie. I have had the FTB,and AE-1. My last was a black body A-1. This new digital blows me away. Love it. Supurb picture quality. Have tried manual exposure, but the auto does so well-why bother. Not real happy with the red eye reduction. It works good, but you have to tell people to wait for the second flash which is a bit of a delay. They start to move immediately after the first flash, but the picture hasn't taken yet. I would have preferred a faster ISO, for darker situations. Other than those two drawbacks the camera is excellent. Batteries last a good long time, but I carry extras.","This is a great camera for the price. Easy to start up. Easy to use . Excellent choice for beginning digital photographer and for all around amateur use. The 2 megapixels provide ultra-sharp resolution for even large 8x10 blow ups. The 3 times optical zoom is an unusual plus for a camera of this price. The Macro is clear and effective. I own 5 digital cameras including expensive, high-end prosumer models and this camera can match most at a fraction of the cost. Great for gift.","This camera is a great buy.  Very small design, but loaded with features.  Simple to use.  You don't have to be an expert to take great pictures.  My previous camera was a Sony 3mp which cost avbout triple the price of the fuji.  The Fuji 2650 is hands down a better camera.","The Fuji FinePix 2650 is the follow-up to their excellent 2600.  They've taken a few cost-cutting measures, including shrinking the LCD a bit and excluding some things from the bundled accessories (namely, rechargeable batteries and a charger - you MUST get some NiMH batteries if you own a digital camera).<br /><br />However, these changes also made the camera lighter and more power-efficient.  The new xD card format does have some advantages over the old SmartMedia cards (faster write speeds, higher capacity, smaller, less power consumption), although these advantages are not as useful in a 2MP camera as they would be in a higher-end model.  Additionally, the price has been lowered as well.<br /><br />Therefore, this camera is still an excellent value in this class.  2MP is definitely enough resolution for most people and the picture quality delivered by the 2650 is very good.  The 3x optical zoom lens is a nice feature at this price point.  It's a great camera for people who are new to digital, since it has automatic modes which make it a pretty foolproof point-and-shoot (only very low light situations give it trouble).  It does have some manual adjustments available, but they're pretty limited.<br /><br />If you want very high resolution or total manual control, look elsewhere, but the average consumer will be totally happy with this camera.  It's relatively cheap, easy to use, and you get great results.","The FinePix 2650 is the second Fuji digital camera I've owned.  I was so impressed with my A101 that I really didn't consider other brands.<br />The 2650 is easy to use with simple menus/options, especially for those that just want a point and shoot camera.  It takes great pictures and the software is much improved over the first version.  One of the real strengths of this camera is the lack of a delay once the shutter button is pushed.<br />However, I do have a serious reservation about this camera and Fuji.  After about 2 weeks of owning the camera, the display stopped working.  Fuji has refused to replace the camera (has offered to fix it) and has left it up to Amazon (the retailer) to replace it if they wish.  Fortunately, Amazon has agreed to credit my account.<br />Despite the defect, I will replace the camera with another Fuji FinePix 2650 and hope for the best, once Amazon credits my account.  However, I remain concerned about Fuji's warranty and customer service.<br />Three stars because of Fuji's questionable customer service and the defect.  Otherwise I really like the camera.","This is my first digital camera and I love it!  I researched various cameras for a couple of weeks and decided on this one because of the new xD Picture Card and the reasonable price.  Of course, being a newbie, I have nothing to compare it to, but I'm having a ball!  Since it is my first digital, I was impressed with the fact that I was able to use it within minutes of receiving it.  I haven't got all the details down pat yet, but I'm working on it.  The basics came very easily and I'm not a professional photographer or a computer expert.  I've taken short movies as well as pictures, which amazes me! I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone interested in a simple, quality, reasonably priced digital.","This is the greatest little digital camera.  It is so easy to use; I could use it right after the salesperson showed me how.  It takes really excellent pictures. You do not need a camera with higher pixels to get a good picture. The 2.0 Mega Pixels is just fine.  I have reccommended this camera over and over.  You will not go wrong on buying this and the $$ is good. Enjoy","This is a splendid point and shoot camera for the price you pay.  I took this camera to Sea World the first day i bought it.  Beautiful outdoor shots, but the lcd was a bit difficult to see in the sun.  Indoor shots were good, but i did have trouble in the shark exhibit.  The flash caused a glare that made it impossible to see.<br />Battery life was great, i used the camera all day w/o having to buy new batteries.  The camera held 30 pix @ mp each.<br />overall a good buy","Fuji FinePix 2650 is my third digital camera. The first one was KB JamCam (that is sold for [$$$] today) and the second one was Kyocera KZ (that I bought for [$$$] or so). Although I had to pay slightly more this time, the improvement is obvious.<br />The pictures are crisp and sharp with colors that are smooth and bright. Unlike the previous cameras, I do not need to adjust the brightness or the contrast of each picture using photoshop software. They look beautiful as soon as I upload them into my computer (and even on the camera's LCD display). The flash does not \"wash out\" the faces; the pictures taken at night look fine, too. The camera has automatic detection of the lighting and also a manual mode that allows one to adjust the \"weather\" and other parameters. There are also several settings for the flash (on/off/auto/red-eye-remove/night-scene).<br />Fuji did a great job with power conservation. Two alkaline AA batteries (included) were sufficient to take about 150 pictures (including 50 shots with flash) and several short videos before the \"battery low\" icon appeared. The power saving features are better than they used to be even though the lens is moving constantly especially when the camera is turned off and on. This motion looks sexy and the sliding cover protecting lens is useful.<br />Aside from the power switch attached on spring, trigger and the switch between three modes stillpix/view/video, the camera is controlled by three buttons next to display - which I would call \"display on/off/grid\", \"enter\" and \"escape\" - and four arrow keys to browse the menus on the LCD display. The up/down arrow key is put on the same button which is also used to zoom in/out. FinePix 2650 can zoom up to 3 times optically (which is the case that keeps the maximal resolution) and the LCD display shows where the digital zoom - up to 2.5 times - takes over. FinePix 2650 has furthermore the 3-position trigger with the AF/AE lock that allows one to focus on the object which won't be in the center of the picture at the end.<br />The totally new feature of FinePix 2650 - compared to its predecessor 2600 - is its tiny and cute Fuji XD memory card. The default 16 MB card (included) can be replaced by cards with up to 128 MB (the biggest one costs about 70 dollars). I am afraid that it is such a big memory that the (alkaline) batteries would be gone before I could fill the memory. With 16 MB I can take about 45 pictures at my favorite 1280 x 960 resolution, about 30 pictures at the maximal resolution 1600 x 1200, or about 130 small 640 x 480 images.<br />The camera has the logo \"designed for Windows XP\" (which is my OS) and it works without any problems (I believe it also works with all older systems). FinePix 2650 immediately connects to the PC as a \"removable disk FinePix E:\" in my case. The package contains a manual as well as some extra new photoshop software. The camera can be also connected as a PC camera for videoconferencing.<br /><br />Generally the videos from FinePix 2650 are sharper than those made with Logitech QuickCam, for example, however I am not satisfied with the behavior of videos in darker environments. The videos (and probably also the image from the \"webcam 2650\") are too dim and I found even QuickCam better in these situations. The camera also does not focus very well in the dark which makes the pictures a bit fuzzy especially if the flash is not used. There is a lot of space for improvement. However, night video is not the main reason why I bought this camera and therefore I can unequivocably recommend this camera."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix A303","amazon_reviews":["I was 100% satisfied with this seller.

It was still around just $200, which was a wonderful deal.  This is a very nice camera for $200.  The pictures turn out beautiful.  The camera is sturdy and appealing to the eye...it's size is great too.  Flashes, options, battery life...it's all there.  It is SO easy to learn how to use.  I've had some trouble because some photo processing places (i.e. Rite Aid) cannot yet service xD.  xD is also a bit costly, but it is actually wonderful...very small and effective.  Overall, a wonderful camera, especially for a beginner or a student.  If you want to edit your pictures well or anything, you'll need better software than what comes with the camera, but that could be found online for free.  Great deal...highly reccommend!","This camera is great.  I recieved one from my parents for my birthday.  The only things I can complain about are: there is no AC adapter included (with mine atleast) and the flash takes a while to charge, and the camera LOVES to use the flash if you let it.<br />It's always good to have extras... so here are a couple of things that might enhance the camera... or anycamera for that matter.<br />1) Bigger memory card.  I have a 64MB chip in mine.  it holds over 100 images on the second highest setting... the 16MB chip holds less than thirty.<br />2)AA rechargeable battaries... I already had these from my mp3 player.<br />3)Case, you don't want it to get scratched do you???<br />Thats it.  you could get a tripod if you really want to...<br />Picture quality is great when left on the automatic setting.","this is my first digital,and I plan to keep it for a long while. I've owned film cameras for years and they are just fine. this little camera is the right size. Do work with the light however. forget the movie part. I would venture out and say this a303 is under rated. once you fiqure it out, your turn out of photo's will have you saying oh yeah I took those.","I bought this camera right before leaving on a trip to Asia.  I did not have much time to learn everything about it, and I'm sure I still havn't, but i feel like I don't need to.<br />It is such an awsome camera.  It is my first digital, and I really could not be happier.  I have taken amazing pictures, and the quality is great.<br />To all of those people who wrote bad reviews about the camera, you should realize that it is meant for the casual photographer, not a professional.  It is easy to use, which makes it easy to bring along and use with friends and family.<br />Most of my friends already know how to use it, so we can all pass it around and share the fun.<br />It is a great deal, and wotth every penny.","This is my forth digital camera, and the best by far.  My others have been HP's and have done a great job, but don't hold a candle to this one as far as res. and speed between shots.  Fuji hit the mark!  The zoom is smooth and the macro autofocus is right on!  I just wish I would have started with Fuji in the first place.","this is my second Fuji purchase. Earlier one was Fuji 2600. The advantages -<br />1) a great 3MP below $200<br />2) 3 modes of operation - still, movie (minus sound) and web (saves another $50 for equivalent quality web camera)<br />3) small and light<br />there are many more, i'll get tried if I satrt writing them all. If you want a digital camera go for this one. no doubt about it. Its the full value for money.<br />since i already have a video camera, so i donot really care about digital cameras being able to take video. No matter what ever brand you take, digital camera can never replace a video camera.<br />the picture quality is damn good. got a several prints from walmart and they have come out much better than my previous point and shoot film camera<br />the only disadvantage is I feel it has longer time lag between taking back to back photos.<br />You will definitely have to shell out more for rechargable batteries ($20) and a 64-128 MB card ($35-$70)<br />Otherwise with this incredible value one cannot ask for more. there are already so many customer reviews written for it, so i need not say anything else.","This is my 3rd digital camera and I couldn't be happier.  The last two were both Olympus.<br />Pro's: Small and lightweight, fast reaction time loading images on LCD, fast reaction when turning cam on and off, very simple to use, built-in flash (as opposed to flip up), and new XD card technology.  The complaints about the \"cheap plastic\" feel really don't bother me since I prefer to have a lightweight camera.<br />Cons: No sound on video, fast battery drainage (get rechargeables).","Is a wonderful camera!  My girlfriend has one and she took her XD card to a photo place and had some pictures printed out, and printed her own on quality paper and you could not tell the difference. If you read the manual that comes with it you can figure out the best settings for the flash and everything else. Would really recommend this camera to anyone.  I bought mine new on ebay for $212, and that also included a 32MEG card(along with the 16MEG), 4 rechargeable batteries & charger, cleaning kit, and case. She paid $300 alone for her camera, so if you shop around you can get some good deals.","Just bought this little guy and I am very pleased.  One negative reviewer hit the only drawback, it's plastic and feels a little fragile.  Other than that, it takes great pictures with minimal effort. Buy yourself an expanded memory card too. I bought the 128 MB SanDisk xD card and it works great as well.","I bought this camera after researching for a good digital camera that was inexpensive.  I am glad I picked this one!  It takes really good pictures and a lot of them with the xD cards.  It will take a huge amount for web pages and the finer the picture you want, the less you can take but still it is a good amount for digital.  I don't think you'll regret buying this one if you want a simple, easy to use, inexpensive everyday camera but if you are like some who are really picky or professionals then you should go for the more pricey ones.  This camera is a 5 out of 5 stars for me!","This is my first digital camera and I'm delighted with it.  Excellent quality pics and super easy to operate (I hardly had to glance at the instructions - use is very intuitive).  I didn't bother with the included software (Windows XP-bundled software takes care of everything as soon as you connect the included USB cable).  Battery life is fine - regular AA batteries lasted ~150 pictures before the low battery symbol appeared.","I really like this camera.  I used it as often as possible and it was very light to carry around.  I will say it takes practice to work all the modes.  I took some night pictures and they weren't so great, but the other pictures I've taken are very sharp and very nice.  I have used it also to talk with friends online on video and it worked very well.  Does eat up regular batteries, but rechargable ones seem to last longer with the camera.  If you use a high pixel mode, be aware there are fewer pictures.  If you plan to take a lot of pictures and don't have access to a computer, get a bigger memory card.  My only improvement would be sound on those movies! :-D","I just bought this camera after doing a fair amount of research on various models.  The interface is very simple to use, and it takes good pictures and makes decent movies for a digital camera.<br />I'm writing this mainly in response to another review.  The only concern I had in buying this camera was that one reviewer here said that if you scroll through the images on the camera, stop in the middle, and then take pictures, it will overwrite the images that you've already taken.  I talked to a friend of mine who also has a Fuji digital camera (although not this model), and he said it didn't happen with his, so I decided to buy the A303.  After playing around with it, I found that it does not overwrite the images in the scenario described above.  So I guess this guy either got a defective model, or accidentally deleted his pictures himself.","I really like the quality pictures this camera takes. ...","This digital camera is great!  Easy to use and understand!  Beautiful pictures and great video!  I love this camera.","I purchased this camera during a recent trip to Boston, and am extreemly happy with my purchase.  This camera takes excellent pictures, is easy to use, and typifies plug-and-play technology at its best. The only thing holding back a 5-star rating is the flash tends not to go off in some low-light situations, but this is easliy remidied by overriding the auto flash function.","Buying a digital camera these days seems to be about as easy as using a spoon to empty Lake Superior. It's a daunting task to say the least, simply because there are so many different manufacturers out there and each makes several cameras. Worse, there are some companies that shouldn't be making digital cameras because the products are so lousy (Polaroid springs to mind). I myself looked at several cameras under five-hundred dollars and above two-hundred dollars as a starting point. I also had criteria including things like I didn't care whether it could capture video. All I wanted was a camera that took pictures and could then transfer those images to my PC. Once I started this process, narrowing down what camera I wanted became a little easier.<br />There aren't many digital cameras out there that can take pictures as well as a half decent 35mm SLR, at least not yet. Some make a very good attempt at it, but, and this is an important but, you're buying the convenience of not having to spend money developing rolls and rolls of film. Another criteria I looked at was storage medium- Compact Flash cards, Sony's proprietary memory sticks or the new XD cards. After examining the different media types, I found I didn't care which one my future camera took. How many of these things are you gonna need, anyway? Between the 16 mb card that came with the camera and the 64 mb card I bought with it, I can store about 250-300 high quality images. That's a lot of pictures and considering you can review and the delete the ones you don't like, freeing up extra space. So unless you're taking a 3-month tour of Europe, it is unlikely that you will run out of memory to store pictures.<br />Initially I had settled on the Sony DSCP7 3.2 mega-pixel camera, but at the last minute jumped ship and purchased the FijiFilm FinePix A303- another smaller 3.2 mega pixel camera and haven't really regretted doing so. It's a wonderful little (about 3 x 2 x 1 inches) silver box that takes good quality images. It has everything I wanted- 6x total zoom, USB port for connecting to my PC, built in flash, built in timer, and red eye reduction. And like anything, it also had to be easy to use, because taking pictures shouldn't be work, but a part of the fun. The A303 can also take video without sound, but that doesn't matter to me since I also own a video camera and if I'm camping on traveling around, I carry both in the same bag.<br />Having owned it for a little over a month, I have found only two irritating functions. First, it eats batteries like there's no tomorrow. In day light, with the view screen turned off and no flash, you might be able to fill a 64 mb card before the batteries die, but if you use the flash and/or screen, forget it- you'll be changing batteries before you know it. The second thing it does and this is the killer because I lost pictures because of it, is if you scroll through images using the review function and don't go all the way to the end, you will overwrite images in memory when you start taking new pictures. I found this out the hard when on a canoe trip when I discovered that several pictures of a white tailed deer drinking from the river side were overwritten by later photos of friends around the camp fire. The first failing is forgivable- alkaline and rechargeable batteries are cheap, but replacing pictures like those are not. It's going to cost the camera a star. Some reviewers have also complained about its plastic construction- okay, so it's made of plastic- what isn't these days?<br />That aside, though, I am very happy with the A303- it does exactly what I want: takes good pictures quickly and easily that I can send to my family and friends. It's economical considering I don't have to pay to develop pictures or even wait to have them developed. It's small and easy to carry and now that I know about the overwriting foible, it won't happen again because I'll know better. For what it costs and for what you get, it's a great value, fun and easy to use. I don't regret buying and the pictures I've taken have made some people very happy.","Surprisingly good images from a small camera at a small price, what's not to like? Now and then, for work, I've shot with a number of 35mm, a couple large format film cameras, one pro-35mm digital, and one digital large format studio system.  That's for work though. The little Fuji A303 is for fun and what simple fun it proved to be.<br />The camera belongs to my 12 year old nephew. It's so simple that a youngster has no trouble getting shots that are every bit as good as the ones I take! Carrying it around all day, taking indoor and outdoor shots, close-ups and scenics, this little camera never flinched. I never had to override any of the automatic exposure settings. It handled backlighting with ease (my subject was in front of a very bright window with southern exposure). I couldn't make it fail. Exposures were brilliant.<br />These images look great printed out, and they are super for use in web sites, email, etc. I'd even use them in a small brochure if shot at the highest setting. (But they are jpegs with some compression so I wouldn't use them too large if the printing is done professionally). All in all, I can't fault this little camera. It's a little stunner. You won't be sorry if you buy it.","I have had several digital cameras, and none gave me better service than the Fuji FinePix. Normally, I do film photography and if I want digital pictures, I scan in the negative. When I went to straight digital photography, I found out that I needed certain features as \"must-haves.\" The Fuji did pretty well on most counts.<br />Photos: Resolution<br />· 2048 x 1536 - on the fine setting<br />· 1600 x 1200  -on the normal setting (fine for most work)<br />· 1280 x 960 or 640 x 480 Lower resolution email setting for smaller files (nice!)<br />Features<br />· JPEG format.<br />·  Up to 60 seconds of 320 x 240 or up to 240 sec's of 160 x 120 motion video<br />· 3X optical zoom<br />Pros:<br />· Great resolution for the price. Fuji delivers sharper pictures than many entry-level competitors.<br />· Choice of settings including that email setting, great if you are taking a bunch of pictures and want to email them without a lot of massaging<br />· Exposure compensation for backlight available (+1.5 to -.2.1 EV exposure value)<br />· White balance choice to change exposure from automatic, good if no manual settings are available, as they are not here.<br />· Controls are EASY to use. I love that directional button for playback and settings.<br />· XD Picture card-new standard for digital-supposed to reduce battery consumption and faster read/write, as well as large capacity.<br />Cons<br />· Relies on AA batteries, leaving you to have to shell out for  a NiMH rechargeable instead, recommended so you don't leave a nasty pile of eco-unfriendly batteries behind you as you go on a photo shoot. And recharging IS more convenient, believe me.<br />· You may be concerned about moving to a new digital format (the XD) or have a stash of standard Smart Memory cards. It's annoying to move to a new standard, though XD offers some advantages.<br />Conclusion: You can't go wrong here for an entry-level digital camera. This delivers plenty of performance for the buck and most people will be more than pleased. Just get a rechargeable battery.<br /> Specs:<br />· 3.24 Megapixel CCD for images up to 2048 x 1536 pixels.<br />· 3x (38-114mm equivalent) F2.8 optical zoom lens<br />· Seamless 3.2x digital zoom in 640x480 mode<br />· 1.5-inch TFT color LCD, approx. 60,000 pixels<br />· Program AE, Manual mode offers exposure compensation<br />· Shooting modes: Still, Movie, Macro<br />· Motion video w/out audio up to 60 secs @ 320x240<br />· White balance selectable in Manual mode<br />· Shutter speeds: Automatic 1/2 seconds to 1/2000 second<br />· 64-zone TTL Metering<br />· ISO sensitivity 100 equivalent<br />· Built in flash with Auto, Red-eye reduction, Forced on, forced off and slow-synchro<br />· 9-frame and 13x zoom playback function with scrolling<br />· xD Picture Card storage, 16MB supplied<br />· USB connectivity<br />· Powered by two standard AA type batteries<br />· Small (4.3 x 2.8 x 1.5 in.) and lightweight (8.8 oz)","Pros: This camera is compact, easy to use, has very good photo quality, inexpensive, Easy menu navigation, 3X zoom lens in relatively compact body, separate self-timer mode.<br />Cons: The movie (video) mode has no sound, Some add ons are a must and cost more, No rechargeable battery included, fairly long shot-to-shot delay, noisy images.<br />Summary: Just bought the A303, and I don't think I could be any happier. I have been snapping and printing shots for the past few days and it has been very easy, even for a technological nivice such as myself. The camera is small, good looking, and lightweight (7oz!). I Paid $300 before accessories, resonable for 3 megapixels. The camera basically comes with everything one would need, but for those who take a lot of shots, a larger memory card (16mb included with camera) would be necessary. I looked at many other brands. Canons were a little bit overpriced, Sonys looked good, but the accessories end up costing more than the camera. If your first time digital enthusiast like me, go for the A303, you won't be sorry!","We bought two for our sons for Christmas and they took them to Heavenly Valley skiing in the woods with two feet of powder. Great shots and video clips that were amazing. Fujiviewer was the simplest we have ever seen. We ran slide shows all day during out vacation. Now their dad bought one too. Fits in your pocket. Get the charger kit and ac adapter. Downloads like a breeze.  Great!!!!","We bought two for our sons for Christmas and they took them to Heavenly Valley skiing in the woods with two feet of powder.

Sure there are other cameras out there that may do more or may have a little bit more zoom but all that is unneeded unless you are taking professional pics...and most of us aren't. I love this camera and so does my fiance'. A great camera to start out with..planning on having this one for awhile!","This is my third digital camera. My first was an Olympus, second an Fuji 2800. Listen very carefully. Each of the above digital cameras have (some) things I like better than the new Fuji A303. For example the Olympus has a far better optical zoom, but I go through batteries like food through a duck (it's awful), my Fuji 2800 has a SLR feel to it, very nice camera, but the if you choose not to use the LCD viewer, you viewing through a lens simulation, but it's really a LCD, a feature that is really a non feature. The movie feature actually has sound (a plus). My new Fuji (tired of waiting?) is powerful 3.24 m/p, nice 3X optical zoom. Here is the best part of this camera, IT'S SMALL, and easy to use. This is particularly important to women who have the smaller designer purses, this will actually fit. It's the size of a cigarette package. For most of us this Fuji has more features you will ever use. For me I set it on A (automatic)setting. You will love the use of the setting wheel, this saves you time, for example if you need a close-up, macro just turn the wheel one click, no menus to scroll down (I love it). Regarding the media card, this is smaller, looks like th older smartmedia, just smaller. Since I have three Digital cameras, I purchased a duel card reader, it reads the larger smart media, and the (new) very compact XD card. I just figured the small card is just more practical for the smaller cameras. The camera is also very handsome. The color LCD on the back is 1.5\" and is very nice, If you like to look through a view finder (I do), you look through a lens viewer. A compact camera, 3.24 M/Pixel, and all the features. Save yourself time & money buy the A303, and thank me later, really.","I wouldn't trade it for any other brand.  I love the size and the quality of the pictures.  I take it with me everyday and have been asked by many to take pictures for special occassions and can depend on the FinePix A303 to deliver.","Small & compact. Easy to use. Takes great digital pictures. I have several digital cameras & this Fuji A303 is so handy. It uses 2AA batteries & you can take about 200 to 300 pics. depending if you shut down the LCD. Xd memory is the size of a stamp. You'll want the ac adapter & an Xd reader that is hard to find in stock. Camera is plastic, but holds up very well. You can't go wrong with this digital camera.","This is a great camera. You can choose multiple resolutions, great flash, and I like that it uses alkaline batteries (you dont have to wait for it to charge up after the batteries are dead.) Also functions as a webcam. Easily intigrates with Windows XP. only down side is the software it is bundled with, but you dan dowload different software to remedy that soltion.","I'm not a photography expert. Wanted a camera to take pictures of my children.  I purchased this camera after much searching on the net and reading of magazine reviews.  My local camera shop strongly recommended it.  It is very easy to use, pictures are clear, sharp, and easily downloaded to your PC.  Friends and family are amazed at the pictures and prints (from shutterfly.com) developed from the camera. (8x10 are unbelievable)  The only downside I can see is slight red-eye in some photos..which is easily removed with software programs.<br />My wife (who hates cameras) even learned how to use in 2 minutes!  You won't be disappointed.","The camera and its software are super simple to set up and use. Even with name brand alkaline batteries, the camera uses a new pair every few days or so with moderate use.","Great little camera!! I took it skiing this past weekend and took video of the whole family. Great virbrant colors, would really recommend it over the 2mp. Buy the 128 and also get the charger and a four pack of the nickel batteries. Buy a nice bag and put the 16 that comes with it in the bag plus a couple of charge batteries and your set. You would have to be some National Geographic person to run out of room and power. Not sure what the last review was about, you have to crack the owners book and check some of the flash settings....probably a couple of pages. The best thing about the camera is you don't need a gym bag to lug it around, fits right on your belt.","Great little camera!! I took it skiing this past weekend and took video of the whole family.

Not a battery hog if you use quality ones. Moved up from Kodak 3400 and glad we did.<br />Nice size and weight. Far as the complants on plastic body<br />go it is comparable to all cams in that price range.","After weeks of shopping I bought the A-303 over Sony and Cannon. I was blown away by the demure size and weight, and it's ability to give sharp pictures that will fill an eight by eleven glossy sheet. 3.2mp, macro setting, movies, and auto flash and focus for about $100 less than it's competition.  How can you go wrong?","I will try to point out some of the problems with this camera,<br />1. It looks cheap and feels cheap plastic. Cover of lens although good looking in pictures, is very flimsy. Try playing with one in a store and you will realize what I mean. Its basically a very thin sheet held by a spring, sure to break soon.<br />2. Too thick/big to compete with Canon Elph's.<br />3. Very less weight means more camera shake and blurry pictures. Yes for a digital camera being too light is also problematic.<br />4. Picture quality only average for a 3MP. Nothing spectacular. Don't be guided by just a \"3MP\" tag... doesn't necesaarily mean better quality. (Just like having fastest processor on your PC doesn't mean best performance, other things like motherboard, chispet, memory etc also count)<br />5. Has max shutter of only 1/2 sec, meaning you won't get any decent night or low light pictures.<br />6. No Video out port for watching pics on TV.<br />7. No sound recorded with movies. Movies have too low frame rate and useless quality. Use as a webcam also isn't practical.<br />8. Lens worse than even other Fuji, 2650.<br />9. To make things worse, it uses a propreitary xD card which is *more than twice* as expensive as CF card here on Amazon. Plus there's no 128MB in stock anywhere as of today. Death to xD card !<br />Why wouldn't someone buy a Canon A40/S200/S330 or Fuji 2650 or Nikon 2500 or Minolta Dimage X or one of dozens of Kodak/Sony/HP models floating around ? Why A303 with new propreitary card and no features for the price except a 3MP tag ? Maybe you might like it though.<br />I don't see any reason why Fuji couldn't use SD or MMC or CF or one of the existing formats or add video out and better movie mode. Hopefully FujiFilm will come with something better next time around !","I had been trying to decide whether to buy this camera or the Canon Powershot S230, and decided on this one - I think that I made the best decision.  For about $100 less, you get much of the same features, and, in my opinion, overall better picture quality than the Canon.  We took this camera to the zoo this weekend, and the picture quality - richness of true color, was amazing - such impressive results from such a small camera.  The added plus was that it was easy to use, and conveniently small enough to fit right into my purse.  The only negative I would say is the shutter lag, and not being able to record sound in the movie mode.  But I am so happy with everything else that it doesn't matter.  This was definitely a smart purchase.","Pros: excellent pictures/colors, light, easy to use (point & shoot), very good PC software, and much better priced compare with other 3.x Mega Pixels.<br />Cons: plastic body, shuttle lag.<br />I recommended this nice toy to all of my relatives and friends. We all love the outcome of pics.","I have recently purchased this camera and my wife and I have been testing it extensively to determine its quality.<br />We have both been pleased with the outdoor and indoor results.  In either case, the pictures comes out very sharp and identical to what we would have seen with our own eyes.<br />The camera is very easy and intuitive to use.  This in combination with its small size makes it convenient.<br />The main problem with this camera is that it is very power hungry...especially when downloading the pictures onto a computer via the provided USB cable.  I would highly recommend purchasing the AC power adapter when downloading the pictures or using it for video teleconferencing.","this camera is a really good value, excellent quality pictures, decent video<br />2 problems: no sound, sux up the batteries like an elephant","I have just purchased the Fuji A303.  The camera is very easy to use and creates great vivid pictures.  Despite what you might of heard from other people this camera is awesome it's light weight, small, and also has a movie mode.  The in camera menus are easy to use not complicated at all like other products. I hope this review helps someone out there thats looking for a great camera.","I purchased this camera a week ago (the night before my vacation). I've used digital cameras before, but this is the first I've purchased. I loved it's ease of use, compact size, picture quality, and style. This camera does not look \"cheap\" like many others. It's a great digital camera to carry with you while you travel -- it's not heavy and bulky and the picture quality is great!","I was surprised at the sharpness of the pics. Colors seem to be good. I havent played with the settings much so any contrast brightness problems I can easily fix in a photo editor. I plugged it into our Macintosh G4 at work and all the photos were easily imported into iPhoto.<br />The camera was smaller than I expected. It has no case so you may want to find one for it. My only beef is that the casing of the body is plastic instead of metal. Metal would be nice, plastic makes me nervous about how durable it will be in the long run, but hell for the price I am very happy with it."]},{"name":"HP Photosmart 320","amazon_reviews":["I originally bought this little camera new, it lasted over a year before it got crushed in my pocket while working outside.

The pic quality is excellent and I have printed (at Walmart, etc.) many 4x5 and 8x10 (yes 8x10) pics and no one believes they were taken using a 1.3 MP camera.  My only real complaint is the shutter lag which is significant when trying to shoot my fast-moving grandson.  I wish SONY would make a similar size camera with a super short shutter lag and maybe a decent movie mode - even if it were only 2-3 MP.","This little camera was my very first digital camera. It was so cool, because I could take it everywhere.  I always had room for it.<br /><br />The only thing that could make it better is if it had zoom.","I have a better camera than this one.  It's a Sony too, and it has 3X zoom, a bigger LCD screen, sound MPG's, more megapixels, and just generally all the bells and whistles that my 2-year-old miniature Sony doesn't have.<br />And yet I still take most of my pictures on the DSCU10.  Why?  Because it's always in my jacket pocket and it's always ready.  It's a full-feature camera and it's smaller than a Snickers bar.  Better still, the design is brilliantly intuitive.  Slide open the cover, press the button.  That's it!  You can even get your Mom to use it.  And while the batteries take a while to charge, it will hold the charge for weeks or even months while you carry it around.  And oddly enough, it's much easier to download from than my newer, more expensive Sony.  Just plug in the USB, the camera turns itself on and it starts downloading.<br />Unquestionably it has weaknesses.  The postage stamp LCD viewscreen is of questionable utility; it's good enough for framing shots but it's impossible to see any detail, especially in daylight.  The picture quality is merely adequate (it would be wise to opt for the higher-rez DSCU20 if possible). The autofocus can be unreliable and the flash is weak.<br />But it's always there for you when your bigger, better camera is at home on the shelf.  Anyone who's serious about photography should have one of these (or the DSCU20) as a second camera.<br />One final note: I don't know if this is a plus or minus, but this camera seems to impress everyone who sees it.  It really looks like some sort of spy camera and on one occasion I was actually accused of being a private detective by a woman who wandered into one of my shots.  Even now that it's getting a little long in the tooth, people still want to look at it to see if it's a real camera, and they're still impressed when they see that it is.","got the pink one as a birthday gift, i fell in love with it cos of the color and its size. I hung it around my neck (it came with a matching grey string) wherever I went, and it never failed to grab attention from people. Its feature packed and the images are fantastic. But its a pity that it doesnt have any optical zoom.","Ilike the camera alot it is funky,cute,adorable i love it i have recomended it to all my friends have one","I think the camera is the coolest thing i take it wherever i go the price is ok to I totally recomend it to anyone who is thinking of buying it I say go for its great the pics are good to and its soooo cute and small I love it !!!!!!!","very small, cute and chic. a little pricey, and lack of a viewfinder eats up batteries, but you get what you pay for. images come out pretty good for a camera this size. great gift. can buy a camera holder, but using the nokia 8260 cell phone holder works just as well.","I just got this little gem as my new glovebox cam. I've used it indoors and outdoors, with and without flash, and I'm very pleased with the pictures I've gotten thus far. I took an experimental movie clip (no sound) and it also looks fine. The 1 megapixel resolution (you can also select 640 x 480) for photos is perfect for computer use and for prints up to 5\" x 7\". The camera uses 2 rechargeable AAAs (the charger is included) and the battery life is very good. The included 8 megabyte Memory Stick is too small, but I put a 128 meg (Lexar) card in there and I get almost 400 pics on its full 1 megapixel setting. Settings and menus are simple and the instruction manual is not needed. The size and weight are of course the big pluses here. I gave it only 4 stars though because I felt the price was a bit high for the specs (obviously, the price is the premium for the size) *and* because without an eyepiece viewfinder, one is forced to frame through the tiny LCD on the camera's rear. That is a nearly impossible task in sunlight, making for a significant drawback. Nonetheless, I'm having fun with it and I'm sure you will too!","This is my pressent from my mom for 8A's PMR result.

The picture quality is merely adequate (it would be wise to opt for the higher-rez DSCU20 if possible). The autofocus can be unreliable and the flash is weak.<br />But it's always there for you when your bigger, better camera is at home on the shelf.  Anyone who's serious about photography should have one of these (or the DSCU20) as a second camera.<br />One final note: I don't know if this is a plus or minus, but this camera seems to impress everyone who sees it.  It really looks like some sort of spy camera and on one occasion I was actually accused of being a private detective by a woman who wandered into one of my shots.  Even now that it's getting a little long in the tooth, people still want to look at it to see if it's a real camera, and they're still impressed when they see that it is.","got the pink one as a birthday gift, i fell in love with it cos of the color and its size. I hung it around my neck (it came with a matching grey string) wherever I went, and it never failed to grab attention from people. Its feature packed and the images are fantastic. But its a pity that it doesnt have any optical zoom.","Ilike the camera alot it is funky,cute,adorable i love it i have recomended it to all my friends have one","I think the camera is the coolest thing i take it wherever i go the price is ok to I totally recomend it to anyone who is thinking of buying it I say go for its great the pics are good to and its soooo cute and small I love it !!!!!!!","very small, cute and chic. a little pricey, and lack of a viewfinder eats up batteries, but you get what you pay for. images come out pretty good for a camera this size. great gift. can buy a camera holder, but using the nokia 8260 cell phone holder works just as well.","I just got this little gem as my new glovebox cam. I've used it indoors and outdoors, with and without flash, and I'm very pleased with the pictures I've gotten thus far. I took an experimental movie clip (no sound) and it also looks fine. The 1 megapixel resolution (you can also select 640 x 480) for photos is perfect for computer use and for prints up to 5\" x 7\". The camera uses 2 rechargeable AAAs (the charger is included) and the battery life is very good. The included 8 megabyte Memory Stick is too small, but I put a 128 meg (Lexar) card in there and I get almost 400 pics on its full 1 megapixel setting. Settings and menus are simple and the instruction manual is not needed. The size and weight are of course the big pluses here. I gave it only 4 stars though because I felt the price was a bit high for the specs (obviously, the price is the premium for the size) *and* because without an eyepiece viewfinder, one is forced to frame through the tiny LCD on the camera's rear. That is a nearly impossible task in sunlight, making for a significant drawback. Nonetheless, I'm having fun with it and I'm sure you will too!","This is my pressent from my mom for 8A's PMR result. As a new photographer i don't need very high resolution. better with this resolution, price and size. its really a digicam. ... but i preferrsd the memory stick should be more megs.","Once I got this nifty little camera out of the box, I was very excited to begin taking pictures. The great thing about this package is everything you need to get started is included, so you don't need to go off buying batteries or memory stick.<br />This camera is fairly simple to operate. Everything is explained in the included instruction manual. For its small size, some people may easily misplace or lose it.<br />There are two image sizes this camera offers: 1280x960 and 640x480. I found the 640x480 to be a lower quality than I expected. Many of the pixels are visible, making a not-so-clear photo. However, the 1280x960 size seems to not have that pixel problem.  Another cool thing possible on this camera is making a 15 sec movie (no audio). The LCD screen is only about an inch wide, so it may be difficult to preview your photos clearly.<br />this isn't a great camera to be printing with. However, if all you want is to send e-mail with them or put them up on a website, then by all means, this camera is well suited for those purposes.","Once I got this nifty little camera out of the box, I was very excited to begin taking pictures.

This camera met all 3 requirements easily.<br />Size: almost as small as the current crop of cell phones. People couldn't believe how small it was. Personally, it's a little on the thick side so I put it in my pants instead of my shirt pocket.<br />Price: good value for your money. More features than you'd expect from a sub camera. Comes with its own recharger and NI-MH batteries. About 13 hours to charge it fully.<br />Picture quality: I was actually quite surprised by the picture quality. Really. It's more than just decent or average, it's good. Movie quality however is terrible. Don't bother with it unless you are outdoors. Also, you cannot record sounds.<br />Bottom line: you'll be glad you gave this camera a shot. Great conversation piece too. Pop in a 128 MB memory stick and you can take up to 375 pictures at 1280x960! It's just a lot of fun!","This camera gets great marks as something you can always carry, and shoot quickly with.  (The simplicity of the camera reduces the \"shutter lag\" that is so frustrating on some digicams - many digicams miss the shot you want because of a delay between when you press the shutter and when it captures the image.)  With this tiny Sony, you get the benefit of the several generations of Sony design of compact digicams, and Sony's skill at miniaturizing electronics.  For some, this really can be the perfect camera.<br />But there are some big compromises, so make sure this is what you want.  There's no optical zoom, so it's harder to make the most of the limited pixel resolution by zooming in just the part of the scene you want. (1.3MP will give you good 4x6 snapshots, but only if you can use the entire frame to capture your images.  For emailing photos, though, that's more than enough pixels - you'll probably trim it down for emailing or for web site photos.)  Lack of a viewfinder means you'll drain the battery quicker, and may have trouble seeing what's in the picture in bright sun (which washes out the LCD).  And the optics and flash do suffer on a camera this small.<br />So think about what you need.  This camera will be a dream for some.  But others can get much better quality and lots of useful features - without much more size or cost - in the Sony DSC-P2 or P7.","This is my first digital camera.  I wanted something simple and dependable--for shooting photos of students, sending shots of the cat to my kids, selling stuff on the internet.  The Sony looked like a good bet.  What I hadn't counted on was the exquisite smallness of the camera.  Scarcely larger than a cigarette lighter, it makes my wife's Canon Elph look like a behemoth by comparison.<br />Given the size and convenience of the camera, I'm a bit surprised and disappointed at Sony's assumption that its owner might require options like sepia mode and a few other features aimed at the \"creative\" photographer.  Just more potential things to go wrong and detract from the camera's point-and-shoot simplicity.  Also puzzling is the feature that allows you to partition the screen into 4 frames containing 4 different images--each about the size of a molecule.<br />Anyway, I'm getting great shots with everything set on \"automatic,\" and the convenience of the thing is leading me to use it much more than I had planned.","I have owned Olympus 400 Z, OlympusRS E100, and when asked by friends about what to look for in a digicam, i always emphasized on the lag time and readiness to shoot.I believe a digicam is for convenience, and not for professional features, which should be left alone to traditional film based camera.So i have been not very happy with what i got, even Olympus RS is a rapid shoot, it still  take multiple steps to set it up if the power is turned off, and the size is as big as a traditional SLR.<br />I just finished the Honolulu Marathon, taking with me in my palm, a brand new Sony DSC U10.The holy grail of digicam is here.<br />It is so light 4 oz, it is instant ready when i slided the cover to the side.The case is plastic, but the whole camera is solid.<br />Once reset the resolution, either VGA, or SVGA, then it is ready to shoot.I don't notice any lag time when i press the record button. Since there is no zoom, the lens covers quite a bit of depth.The color came out very nice, comparable to my Olympus RS.<br />Of course, i couldn't quite capture the front runners when they zoom by, but had i used the burst mode, it might have worked.<br />There is also a mpeg movie mode, but i haven't tried.The built in flash has several setting, including red eye reduction and back light fill in.So i took 48 pictures during the race, 4 of them were not usable.<br />I am very happy with this camera .I will pack my Olympus RS now, and put the Sony in my pocket all the time.May be i finally become a photojournalist."]},{"name":"Casio QV-R4","amazon_reviews":["Love this camera.

Thanks to Casio for meeting my digital needs, I will be a return customer for sure!!!!!!","I have used this camera for couple of months now and I am quite pleased with it, though I am dissapointed that you can not buy the charger from the manifacturer separetly.  I have lost the charger and I can not charge the battery.  I have to carry an external battery unit to use the camera which really dissapoints me.  I do not understand why the manifacturer does not supply the charger for the unique battery that the camera comes with?????","I just picked this camera up and snapped a few photos.  The user interface is wonderful: as long as you don't want to do manual focus or other manual functions, you won't even have to read a manual to figure out how to use features like \"Best Shot\" modes or using the special effects like \"sepia\".  The UI is the best I've ever seen in a digital camera though I have really only used a Canon camera for more than a few minutes.<br />While the photos look great when imported into my Mac, the extra resolution above 1600x1200 doesn't seem to make that much of a difference (even as I zoom in to different areas).  I'm going on a trip tomorrow so I'll have a chance to vary the resolution and see if it really matters.  If you just want your first digitial camera, 1600x1200 resolution may be good enough for you and you'll save some money.  One thing that I noticed and liked was that this camera seems to take pictures pretty quickly (less lag) as compared with other cameras I've used.<br />Now for some flaws.  The movie mode is horrible when compared to my brother's Canon Powershot (roughly the same size and his model was cheaper than this one).  For one, the Canon had sound but you don't get sound with this camera.  You may argue that if you want to make movies, buy a DV camera but my brother has sent me some cool little emails of my niece and the movie mode really is a good plus.  Second, the movie mode picture was much grainier than with my brother's Canon.  I probably won't use the movie mode on this camera but I probably would have if it was better.<br />In summary: great pictures so far (even though it is a cloudy day), great size, best UI I've seen, but the awful movie mode prevents me from giving this camera 5 stars (though I guess 4.5 stars would be closer to my opnion).","I was totally amazed by all the functions that this camera can perform. It has options that my more expensive cameras don't have. The main reason I bought this camera is to have a light weight digicam to carry in my purse at all times. I was missing too many opportunities. I have taken dozens of test shots and have not been disappointed. The color of creeks, in this part of Texas, is brown from the tannic acid, I merely use the built in blue filter and I have wonderful water! All the grass is dead and the pines have brown needles with a little green, I use the built in green filter and it looks like summer. The clarity is good right out of the camera and the images need little or no post production work. It surprised me that the battery life is so good since I thought that with a pack that small, I would run out in no time, but it's excellent. I can't say enough good things about this camera. I like it much better than my G2. The ability to regulate the flash is great, since I would tend to blow macro shots right out of the scene. The option to reduce the flash output is extremely valuable to me. The camera is unbelievably easy to use and I started shooting before having had time to read the manual and had no difficulty. I'm in the process of reading it now and it is also excellent, easy to understand and to the point. The camera is also fast, which is a definite plus!","I'm more of a filmmaker than a photorapher so I don't own a $15,000 digital still camera. I have, until now, been very hesitant about going digital when it comes to still photography.  It's very difficult to compete with the resolution of 35mm film cameras.  Problem being: you never know when you're going to snap that perfect shot you'll want to become a table top picture.  I could've easily bought a digital camera before, but without paying INSANE amounts of money I would always be resorting to a resolution comprimised photograph.  With this puppy, I can take many photos at the highest resolution.  I have two 64MB memory cards can can take about 30 pics on eash with the hightest setting. That's a 2MB picture!!  The day I bought it I plugged it directly into my iBook and lauched iPhoto...without any software to be installed, it simply begain downloading the pics.  While in the computer I decided to zoom in on the pictures to see how good the resolution gets....I just kept zooming and zooming and the picture looks good.  I feel comfortable now that I'm not loosing out on quality by using the digital means.<br />It has a couple of features I think are very cool.  One is the timelaps feature.  You set the camera on a table and tell it to take a picture every 1-60 minutes and it comes on automatically and snaps it.  Another one are what casio calls the 'best shot' options.  One of the things I hate the most is giving up the camera to someone to take a picture because I may have to be in the shot.  I'm always very particular about the angle, subject size etc about a shot...but most people don't seem to be. One of the best shot options allows me to snap a photo and it will take that picture and overlay it onto the lcd display at about a 50% opacity so the new photographer can align the camera using the photo I took as a guide to line everything up.<br />In comparing this digital camera with my 35mm film camera I noticed a couple of things about the imagery.  Film has been engineered for 100 years to produced the nicest looking image. Applicable digital technology about 20.  Fleshtones and Blacks are the hardest things for the digital image to compete with, but the casio does great.  Sometimes the automatic settings come under par, but I can adust the shutter speed and f-stop manually to get the image just right using the lcd.  I haven't figured out how to calibrate the flash to match film, but that's for another weekend....it works pretty good on auto. (i'm picky)<br />Keep in mind that I haven't tried hundreds of these cameras in this price range but I was instanly attracked to the casio because of the nice interface, its small size, and its big punch.<br />I'll still use my film camera of course when beauty is of upmost importance, but for a camera I can stick in in my bag and be happy with the Casio rocks.<br />Good luck to all.

In addition, by connecting directly to Canon's CP-100 dye-sublimation printer, first-time users of digital cameras can make high-quality color prints without the complexity of a computer. The A200 can also be used as an underwater camera when used with its optional waterproof housing to depths of up to 100 feet. The PowerShot A200 will be available at authorized Canon retailers nationwide in July,2002 and have a suggested retail price of $ 299.<br /><br />The PowerShot A200 is a 2.0 megapixel, single-focal length autofocus camera incorporating several advanced camera features including Movie mode, Photo Effects, Direct Print capabilities using Canon's CP-100 dye-sub printer, and magnified playback up to 10x for precise image confirmation. It is designed to make digital photography as easy as point-and-shoot.<br /><br />The PowerShot A200 also incorporates a number of high-end features including the popular Photo Effects mode originally introduced in the highly advanced PowerShot G2 camera. A low sharpening mode has been added to the Vivid, Neutral, Sepia and Black-and-White modes for a total of five separate effects for greater creativity.<br /><br />The shutter speed range of the A200 is among the widest in its class with a maximum shutter speed of 1/2000 second. Combining this speed with the lens's f/5.6 minimum aperture setting makes the A200 ideal for daylight photography and fast-moving objects. Alternatively, when the one-second slow shutter speed is combined with the camera's f/2.8 maximum aperture and optional ISO 400 setting, photos taken in low light conditions can be captured easily.<br /><br />The PowerShot A200 can record movies in QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) and Q2VGA (160 x 120 pixels) at 20 frames per second. Up to 9 seconds of continuous recording is possible in QVGA, and up to 30 seconds in the Q2VGA format.<br /><br />Additional features offered with the PowerShot A200 include 3-point AiAF focusing; magnified playback to easily confirm critical focus, high-speed continuous shooting at 2.5 fps, 4.0X digital zoom capability, built-in flash with four flash modes and RGB primary color filters.

In addition, by connecting directly to Canon's CP-100 dye-sublimation printer, first-time users of digital cameras can make high-quality color prints without the complexity of a computer. The A200 can also be used as an underwater camera when used with its optional waterproof housing to depths of up to 100 feet. The PowerShot A200 will be available at authorized Canon retailers nationwide in July,2002 and have a suggested retail price of $ 299.<br /><br />The PowerShot A200 is a 2.0 megapixel, single-focal length autofocus camera incorporating several advanced camera features including Movie mode, Photo Effects, Direct Print capabilities using Canon's CP-100 dye-sub printer, and magnified playback up to 10x for precise image confirmation. It is designed to make digital photography as easy as point-and-shoot.<br /><br />The PowerShot A200 also incorporates a number of high-end features including the popular Photo Effects mode originally introduced in the highly advanced PowerShot G2 camera. A low sharpening mode has been added to the Vivid, Neutral, Sepia and Black-and-White modes for a total of five separate effects for greater creativity.<br /><br />The shutter speed range of the A200 is among the widest in its class with a maximum shutter speed of 1/2000 second. Combining this speed with the lens's f/5.6 minimum aperture setting makes the A200 ideal for daylight photography and fast-moving objects. Alternatively, when the one-second slow shutter speed is combined with the camera's f/2.8 maximum aperture and optional ISO 400 setting, photos taken in low light conditions can be captured easily.<br /><br />The PowerShot A200 can record movies in QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) and Q2VGA (160 x 120 pixels) at 20 frames per second. Up to 9 seconds of continuous recording is possible in QVGA, and up to 30 seconds in the Q2VGA format.<br /><br />Additional features offered with the PowerShot A200 include 3-point AiAF focusing; magnified playback to easily confirm critical focus, high-speed continuous shooting at 2.5 fps, 4.0X digital zoom capability, built-in flash with four flash modes and RGB primary color filters. The A200 uses two AA-size batteries and is compatible with CompactFlash Type I removable media.<br /><br />Image Management Software<br />Bundled with a suite of programs enabling image management, editing, compositing and printing, the PowerShot A200 is compatible with a wide range of Mac and PC computers, including support for Windows XP and Mac OS X.

You can also send them right to your photo store to be printed and... you will not be disappointed by the quality of the result. You can also take short films (less than 15 sec.) well worth it if you want to send them over the Internet.<br />Three tips: 1) Buy a larger Memory Card than the one that comes with the camera. I bought a 64MB and have space for more than 100 pictures at a time. 2) Buy rechargable batteries. You can get broke if you use standard batteries. 3) If you are indoors do not close the cover between photos. The light-sensor will act much quicker and take photos faster if it has already make the auto-sensing.","Hi All,<br />This camera has a number of nice features and takes nice photos.  Many cameras in this price range don't do nearly as well in terms of low light performance, color fidelity in incandescent lighting, or macro ability, plus having all those buttons on the back of the case is actually a lot easier than having to go through a bunch of on-screen menus.<br />My two main misgivings about the camera are that I've gotten some aliasing of diagonal lines a few times (though they don't seem to be all that noticeable in the prints) and the focus assist beam never seems to help.  I guess I can live with the latter for the most part as I've figured out what focusing range the camera defaults to when it can't lock focus, about 8ft to infinity in normal mode and 4.25* inches in macro mode(*which is about the width of the camera, 4.3\").  The infinity mode also doesn't appear to have any effect from what I can tell.  How have other people's experiences run with the focus assist beam, infinity mode and aliasing?<br />Lastly Canon's tech support hasn't been very good,  I don't need someone to read out of the user guide to me, but that's as much as they seem to do.  If I could get past that first level of tech support, things would probably be different.<br />But really, I like the camera!  Oh yeah, the small size and light weight mean I can comfortably carry it in a shirt pocket.  Battery life with 1700mah Nimh is fine, though I rarely use the flash or the LCD.  I guess it would be nice to have an output for display on a TV and the little rubber flap that covers the ports could be more secure.<br />Will","This is my first digital camera and I am very impressed. The camera itself is simple to use and takes great pictures. With the 3 different resolution settings, it makes it very easy to take pictures in accordance to how big you would like to print the pictures once you're done. The 1600x1200 size with minimal compression produces great looking 8x10 prints, and the 1024x768 has resulted in several pics that I have used as wallpaper in Windows. Nothing brightens up your day like turning on your monitor, and seeing a hi-res image taken at Mountaineer Field in Morgantown, West Virginia! I fully recommend this product for the beginner or the experienced!","Alright, let me first start off by saying that I got an awesome deal on this camera.  The price is incredible for what you are getting, plus its cheap enough for a starter to get into digital photography without making a dent in the pocket book.<br />Let me just summarize my pros and cons for this camera:<br />Pros:<br />- awesome price (I think this is a HUGE factor)<br />- takes compact flash (these are typically cheaper than other types of memory)<br />- takes 2 AA batteries (don't need special batteries)<br />- 2 megapixels offers good quality photos<br />- USB connection (you don't need a CF reader/writer)<br />- lightweight<br />- awesome effects such as b/w, moasic, vivid, movie mode<br />Overall, its a great **starter** camera.  However, once you get comfortable you will probably want a better camera due to the limitations I will discuss now.<br />Cons:<br />- only digital zoom (the quality of the zoom is so terrible that its not worth using, specially indoors since the flash isn't strong enough to get you a picture)<br />- battery door is flimsy (the battery door is very flimsy and it broke when I dropped the camera once)<br />- exteremely vulnerable to impact (dropped the camera a total of about 2 ft and it stopped focusing properly... be very careful NOT to drop the camera)<br />- automatic settings not good enough (I had to use the manual settings to get better quality pictures when indoors)<br />- takes a while to encode image (specially when you have the file size set smaller.. it takes between 5 - 10 seconds to encode the image.  I'm thinking it compresses the image on the fly and that slows it down)<br />Well, thats about it honestly.  One addition... invest in rechargable batteries and a charger, a pair of batteries lasts only a few hours specially when used indoors with the flash.<br />Like I said, its a great starter camera but you will grow past it within 6 months.<br />Hope this helps... please vote YES if it did I appreciate it.<br />Khosrof","This camera is an excellent, fast camera.  It takes pictures, and movies.  It is an excellent starter camera.  If all you want to do is take pictures, or videos, this is an excellent camera for you.  The only 2 downsides are:<br />  -It is ugly.  The A-10 look a lot nicer.<br />  -It is uncomfortable.  It's just a cube.<br />These 2 downsides have nothing to do with the performance.  This is a great camera for the modest budget, or for a beginner.","When I ordered this camera for my son it was advertised that we would receive a 34 megabit memory card along with the 4 megabit that it came with.  What happened?","I bought this camera to take some pictures of my baby girl and I discovered that it's very very easy to use. Multilanguage menus (configurables), Excellent options such as a great zoom, Auto Focus (with Artificial Intelligence), etc.<br />Such as this kind of electronic equipements this camera eats batteries... with a pair of AA Alkalines you can use it by 2 1/2 or 3 hour... No more... Without using the display...!<br />Excellent for beginners...! I recommend you to buy the charger to this specific model... it longs the life of your batteries and can be rechargables...!","This is my first digital camera and I received it for Christmas and am still learning to use it.  The menus are confusing and it takes a long time to focus and shoot a photo while pressing the shoot button.  The quality seems good though.  During the first week I had it, I used 2 sets of AA batteries and took about 15 pictures.  I then bought some NiMH rechargable batteries which seem to last much longer.  I also did not appreciate the fact that no AC power cord is included and the manual continaully refers to using one while downloading photos to a computer to preserve the batteries.  I used one set of batteries during my first download alone.  Hopefully this will decrease with the rechargeable batteries and also now that I have figured out how to shut off the LCD during downloading.","I purchased this camera to replace a Kodak DC200 plus, one of the first 1 megapixel cameras on the market. It's a great camera that has provided 1000s of good looking 4X6 prints over the years. But, it's time to upgrade.<br />Let me start by saying that I am not an ace photographer or anything. I'm just your basic point and shoot family picture taker kind of guy. So, please interpret my comments about the A200 in light of that fact.<br />I decided to purchase the A200 based on two factors -- price and reviews. Both were excellent. Out of the box it is eye catching. Much smaller than my old Kodak with an automatic lens cover (nice to have!). Opening the lens cover fires up the camera and it's ready for the first shot within a matter of seconds. OK, here's where the annoyance factor kicks in. This is, by far, the slowest freakin' digital camera I have ever played with. A three hour visit to the camera sections of a few electronics stores this afternoon confirmed my first impression. It really is slow! You absolutely must depress the shutter release button 1/2 way and wait for it to autofocus before taking the shot. One cannot get a shot off quickly with this camera. I have a two year old. He is in another room by the time this camera is ready to take a picture of him. OK, so you've taken a picture, now the waiting continues. It takes roughly 12-17 seconds (depending on the charge in the battery) to recharge the flash and prepare for another shot!!! Yep, 12-17 seconds! My old Kodak is faster. In all fairness, when the flash is not used, the A200 is lightening quick at refreshing for the next shot. However, because of what I use it for, most of my shots are indoors and require the flash.<br />What about picture quality? Not bad. Not great. Three out of the four professional reviews that I read about this camera state that the picture quality is excellent. The fourth review seems to concur with my opinion. The quality is OK. Red eye is an enormous problem, even with red eye reduction on. Again, hate to sound like a broken record, but my old Kodak...<br />Professional reviewers seem to like this camera because of the manual controls. These are not important to me, as I just want to turn the thing on and take pictures. If you're just looking for a simple point and shoot camera, I wouldn't worry too much about manual options.<br />One last complaint before I tell you what I exchanged the thing for... The controls on the back of the camera are completely unintuitive. No little jog-dial like you find on several other cameras, including the Canon A40 (an excellent, though clunkier, alternative complete with 3X optical zoom).<br />So, after some serious thinking, reading, and playing, I decided to go with the Sony DSC-P31, also an autofocus, no optical zoom, 2.0 megapixel camera. About 20 beans more but it comes with two high capacity rechargeablee NiMH batteries. It has essentially every feature that the Canon A200 has and more. It even has an option to take pictures in 3:2 format, which is the perfect format for 4X6 prints I guess. No cropping needed. The big plus for me is that the thing is very very fast. Fast enough to take pictures of spazzy kids. Not only does it take pictures quickly but it is ready for the next shot in about 3 seconds even when the flash is used. It also has video out so that pictures can be viewed on your TV set or even recorded to VHS if you so desire. A nice feature.<br />About Amazon, absolutely, hands down, the best place to buy things online in my opinion. They frequently offer free shipping deals and, of course, no tax. Customer service is incredible and it is very very easy to return products. They even pay return shipping. Also, you can keep track of the location of your package from the moment you place the order to the moment it arrives on your porch. Items always come sooner than they estimate. You can even cancel your order up to the moment that the product is prepared for shipping. Nice option in case your spouse doesn't agree with your decision to buy that $5000 plasma HD television set!<br />Happy shopping!<br />Update 12/29/02....  I've had my new Sony DSC-P31 for about a week now and took gobs of pictures with it during the Holidays.  I highly recommend this camera over the Canon A200.  Much easier to use, much faster, and more conistent picture quality with the Auto Focus on.  One cool thing about the camera that I didn't mention before is that, in addition to Auto Focus, you can set the focus to a range of different distances, like 3 meters, 9 meters, 30 meters... infinity.  I decided to disable autofocus and set the focus distance to 9 meters (I think, as I don't have the camera with me).  This makes the camera even faster than before and seems to provide better pictures than with the autofocus on!  I've had minor problems with red eye, as I gather is common with most cameras especially when shooting pictures of kids.  Luckily, this is easily fixable with the software that comes with the camera.  Best wishes, Joe.","Great value, easy to use, not too small but manageable.<br />Eats regular AA's but lasts well when you use 1600 or<br />1800 mAmp/hr NiMH","I recommend buying the Canon A40 instead.  In fact, I just returned my A200 in order to do just that.  Here's why:<br />* The A40 has a more solid feel in your hand.  Instead of \"perching\" in your hand, it \"fits\" your hand.  (Look at the nice curve that fits into your right hand as you hold the camera.)<br />* The A40 has an optical zoom, as well as the digital zoom that most digital cameras have.  The A200 only has a digital zoom; you lose some quality.<br />* The controls on the A40 are easier to understand and better layed out.  The A40 has what you call a thumb wheel.  To switch between picture taking modes, or into photo review mode, you just spin the wheel.  No pressing the same button over-and-over.<br />* Finally, it's easier to change the batteries on the A40!!  Why did Canon make the battery compartment so hard to open on a piece of equipment that needs its batteries changed daily or weekly??<br />If you just need a bare-bones camera that takes great pictures, buy the A200.  I was very impressed with the quality of the photos.<br />If you want a more comfortable and intuitive camera, get the A40.","The A200 by Canon is definately a great camera. Movies - The movies it records are very clear and smooth. I am using a 64mb CompactFlash disk so I can get tons of video on it.<br />Photos - By using the Medium resolution (1024x768) with medium compression and using a 64mb CompactFlash card I can get 204 photos on it. That's 66 more than I got with the HP. The photos are very clear and crisp with this cam as well. And I love the ability to change the photo type (normal, vivid, sepia, etc...). I use the vivid so it makes the photo more rich and deep.<br />Definately worth the price.","Thicker than I expected, the specs said 1.3 in but I measured it and came to be close to 1.45 so feel bulky in hand and pocket. Image quality is top notch in the sub 200 market, there are better 2mp cameras but they all have zoom and are more expensive. The software is a pain to use, and that's the worst thing about this camera, ... However with the A200 you have to install driver and software and you can't just drag and drop. ...","THis is a very good camera for its price, however, on lithium batteries it will last only 4-5 exposures. make sure u get a set of good NiMH batteries with charger.. one charge lasts about 300 exposures or more, and u don't have to use expernal power source while camera is connected to PC - those batteries handle 'em all.","I bought it as a first digital camera, checking out the terrain before making a big investment.  My friends are ohing and ahing over the pictures I took in Rio with this thing (of course, you don't need a great camera to get great pictures in Rio!).  It travels well, eats batteries more than I expected, is easy to use, takes a little while to warm up when first switched on, and lives up to the positive reviews I've read here and on the web...Buy a 128M memory card and rechargable batteries, and enjoy.  There's a waterproof case available, something I'll buy if I can find a discount as I'm an avid SCUBA diver and snow-skier (the kind of skier who would need a waterproof case).  I was disappointed with my order - Amazon listed a coupon for a reduced-price memory card but the web site wouldn't let me apply it to my order - but I'm not disappointed with the camera.  Enjoy!","There is no one best camera but the Canon A200 comes close.  This is<br />  my seventh digital camera.  ...","I have a \"grown up digital camera\", a Minolta Dimage 7 with all the bells and whistles. It is a camera to use when you are being very serious about the pictures you are taking.<br />It is big though and I carry a lot of stuff in my bag to support it. I needed something small to take pictures when lugging around a Dimage 7 is sort of a waste of energy.<br />This is a very good little camera, which takes pictures comparable to my old Nikon CoolPix 800. The Nikon cost a lot more, too.<br />There is no optical zoom, however and that is what keeps me from giving this camera a 5 star rating. But I can pop it into my pocket and know that it is there when the unexpected photo opportunity comes along.<br />It has an available underwater housing and I would have no hestitation using it properly fitted (even if they had it for the Minolta I would never risk it). I also think it would be acceptable for use on the slopes.","This camera is faster than most digital cameras out there; from opening it to it turning on and being ready to shoot it takes about three seconds; from pressing the shutter button down to it taking a picture it takes almost one second (even faster if you've already pressed the shutter down half-way to focus and meter);  from it taking a full-size, best-quality 2 mega pixel shot to it being ready to take another it takes about three seconds (even faster with less quality or smaller sized pictures).  The camera controls on the back allow you to easily change to close-up mode or change white balance or add exposure compensation or turn off the flash or use the stitch-assist mode or the self-timer with from one button push for close-up mode to around four to six button pushes for the more complicated added features.  The lens is the equivalent of a 39mm f2.8 lens on a film-slr camera and it focuses very fast with an auto-focus mechanism that chooses the most likely subject among three focus squares in the middle of the viewfinder/lcd screen to focus on and it has an auto-focus assist beam that aids in focusing; speeding it up especially in scenes with slightly lower light levels.<br />This camera is cheaper than many cameras out there.  It costs around [$$$]right now which is cheaper than most 2 megapixel cameras right now.  The material it's made out of is a  sticky plastic which feels grimy if you hold it too long while you're out in the sun because the sweat on your hands tends to smear all over it and generally yucks it up (just wipe it off with your shirt; it's no big deal).  This camera takes compact flash type 1 cards which are very easy to find and fairly reasonably priced for a good-sized card (if you already have a more expensive Digital camera that uses compact flash cards then obviously; you're in luck!).  The batteries that it uses are two double A's; rechargeable or alkalines (very-very easy to find; just go down to your local [store]to find the nickel metal hydride rechargeable kinds).  If you don't have a compact flash card reader but you do have a usb port then you can transfer the images right off of the camera and straight into your computer (Mac or PC).  If you don't have a computer then you can still use the camera; just buy one of Canon's two available dye-sublimation printers and you can print pictures from 6X4inches to smaller than a postage stamp and almost every size in between to your heart's content.<br />Is this camera better than most cameras out there?  One argument against it is it doesn't have an optical zoom; but truthfully having a zoom lens doesn't necessarily mean your pictures are automatically going to be better; for example instead of zooming in and taking a \"stalker\" picture of that cutey down the hall why don't you just walk up to that cutey and say smile! and take that cutey's picture from up close and then engage that cutey in an actual conversation; believe me your picture quality will improve dramatically!  Another argument against this camera is that it only has two megapixels; but truthfully for snap-shot sized pictures or smaller including pictures that you're going to be using on the web you don't need that extra one or two megapixels over the first two megapixels; it's just pixel overkill for a picture of your uncle holding up that trout he just wrestled into his net or extreme close-ups of your baby doing everything from sleeping peacefully in the crib to crying red-faced while you're giving her another bath or changing her diaper for like the hundreth time.  A third argument against it is that compared to a comparable camera such as the[$$$]it is made of cheaper materials and it's much bulkier; but truthfully many people find those smaller elf-like cameras clunkier; they're slower to turn on they're slower to extend their lens; they're heavier; they're more expensive; they're less responsive to the user when their shutter buttons are pushed; they use more expensive proprietary batteries; they give people with bigger hands or arthritis carpal tunnel syndrome and the list goes on...<br />Is this camera better than any other camera out there I ask again?  Well obviously the simple truth answer is no; you can always buy a more expensive camera and get more pixels or longer lenses or interchangeble lenses and flash-shoes and doodads to your heart's content so a more appropriate question to ask would be is this camera better than any other camera out there for the intended task that I seek it to do as a prospective camera buyer on the market?  Well; we'll leave that question up to you!"]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 4500","amazon_reviews":["a little old, but can't impact to use. Posted a lot of fitment to me.","The Nikon 4500 was the end of the line for the large, swivil body line that Nikon pioneered.  Brought out in 2003, it was a great camera that I enjoyed using very much.  In addition, I purchased many accessories to go with it.  Earlier this year, my old freind suffered a fall and was damaged.  I debated about sending it to a repair facility, or  just buying a new camera.  You can imagine my delight when I found a \"like new\" model on Amazon for only $100.  Instead of being like new, it was new, unopened in the original box.  Now I am back taking excellent pictures with a camera I am familiar with, and one that I can do a number of things with because of all the accesories I have accumulated.  This was a great deal.","Snuffy's Outhouse went above and beyond the call of customer service.

As pictures from \"the day of\" can not be repeated, to have that back up in case a battery needs charging on-site, is huge. Thanks so much, Gary!","The image is very natural.

Nikon pioneered some features that others have followed.  I like to use of add-on lenses for the CoolPix; too bad this feature has not been continued.","This is an excellent camera.  One of the best features is this camera can be rotated to take picture in any angle. i.e. you can keep the camera a feet above your head and by looking at the LCD display you can take a perfect picture!

Posted a lot of fitment to me.","The Nikon 4500 was the end of the line for the large, swivil body line that Nikon pioneered.  Brought out in 2003, it was a great camera that I enjoyed using very much.  In addition, I purchased many accessories to go with it.  Earlier this year, my old freind suffered a fall and was damaged.  I debated about sending it to a repair facility, or  just buying a new camera.  You can imagine my delight when I found a \"like new\" model on Amazon for only $100.  Instead of being like new, it was new, unopened in the original box.  Now I am back taking excellent pictures with a camera I am familiar with, and one that I can do a number of things with because of all the accesories I have accumulated.  This was a great deal.","Snuffy's Outhouse went above and beyond the call of customer service.  When I mentioned in an email to Gary that the camera is used on the job on ranches far from the ranch house where there are NO amenities, Gary searched for and found a car charger and sent it at no extra charge. As pictures from \"the day of\" can not be repeated, to have that back up in case a battery needs charging on-site, is huge. Thanks so much, Gary!","The image is very natural. The macro is incredible. I wish Nikon continues to make something like this with more mega pix.","This is a great little camera and I'd recommend it to anyone who's technologically savvy.

I even use it with a Kaidan panoramic mount and both the fisheye and wide angle lenses without any problems.  All I can add is that it is a tough camera with lots of features and great quality.","This is one of the finest digital cameras that has been sold.  Currently Nikon may have \"more powerful\" but overall less appealing devices out.  Two of the 4500's strongest points include the totally enclosed lens system and the swivel design.  Both of which were changed in more recent designs by Nikon. Another superb feature includes the macro ability - you can get within 0.8 inches of a subject. This is fantastic for nature photography.<br /><br />I currently have two of these units. The first 4500 had over 55,000 shots on it before any problems appeared.  The second was purchased as a backup while the first was being repaired by Nikon.  The only real negative that I have encountered would be Nikon's outrageous repair costs. The zoom button gave out after 55,000 shots (this is heavym mostly outdoor use and it's failure is not a complaint).  Nikon wanted $230+ to repair/replace this switch. Considering the camera was only $400 new this was highway robbery! They also wanted an additional $150.00 to re-adhere the rubber finger grip to the camera body!!!!! Such unrealistic repair costs must be to get the user to buy a new camera but only leaves a very bad taste for Nikon's service department instead.<br /><br />If you can still pick one of these up new or in like-new condition I strongly reccomend it, as there simply has not been a newer model that can do all this unit is capable of.","I got this cam in thailand two years ago and while it's been a real workhorse for me, i'm surprised to see it's still selling around the web. Well, maybe it's that good a camera. I give it four stars; here's why: the quality of the build is good but for the following things: focus motor connector came loose once and rubber strip on front is now super-glued. i am a journalist, so i beat the hell outta these things. as far as function: the tele-converter tc-e33d 3x is worthless on this camera without a tripod and the results are questionable even with. Performance in low light is not good.  Battery life is good. And the fact that you can pop in disposables available anywhere is a blessing. Oh, the AV output connector stopped outputting some time ago...the socket in the camera is defective i suspect.  BUT THE AMAZING THING is the camera's clarity in closeup mode using the WC-E24 lens. It's what you would expect from a professional SLR, but not in a consumer digital.  I did some catalogue work with this camera using the ring-light adapter and I don't think the SLR could have done better. Don't be swayed by those who say why not get an SLR instead of this one, or get a tiny IXUS?  This camera is perfect for the professional who already has too much to lug around and can't be bothered with tiny toys either. Good luck!","OK, first of all, I'm a 14-year-old wanting to just snap some pictures on the go, and something I could afford. However, my dad is a photographer and would like to have some use for a digital cam too... after lots of research, this camera is clearly the best for us. I LOVE IT! :) It has GREAT quality. The setting options are endless, but if you don't want to fool around, that's fine. Auto mode is your friend. And for those who say the menus are hard to control...sure, it could be easier. But after reading the manual, the controls really aren't THAT hard. The swivel design is really clever...and yes, Nikon customer service is horrid, but then again, so are many other companies. You've got to admit, Nikon makes amazing cameras.<br />If all you want is a little techie toy to show off to your friends and take some pictures, look somewhere else. It's rather bulky sometimes, but the good factors definitely outweigh that. It's not the most cool-looking camera in the world, but I'm glad Nikon focused on quality instead.<br />And one more thing...when they said that having to take the battery out to recharge was a bad thing? It's not, necessarily. Think about it. If you have a backup battery (like me), it is SO much better to be able to use the camera, then when one battery runs out, put it to charge while you use the other battery to keep snapping pictures. It's BETTER this way! :)<br />Hope this was helpful!","We got this camera for Christmas, 2002.  Since I don't think that reviews written when the item is new are very useful, I waited for six months to pass and the camera had some use.  I now find it all I hoped for, and more!  There is only one annoying characteristic and that is the shutter delay, but it is something you learn to anticipate.  Pictures are very good (don't make decisions based on the small canera screen) and really come alive when uploaded to the computer.  You do need experience to learn the extensive menus and you will find things contained that are very hard to get back to, but it is all there!  A great camera for the money.","I have worked my way through numerous brands of digital cameras, and recently purchased a Coolpix 4500.  Picked up a 512MB which allows for 266 of the finest qualty pictures the camera can produce.  The familar \"split\" design of the camera housing is wonderful, allowing  photos at odd angles.  The QUALITY of camera itself is SUPERB.  The 4.0 MP  produces 8x10 prints that rival and surpass many film cameras.  I use it with a Canon i560... and colors and detail with knock your socks off! The menu system requires a little learning, and it is worth reading the manual. I've only scratched the surface of this cameras' abilities.  No complaints, except I believe this may be the last of Nikons \"split\" design. (a real shame!)","I purchased this camera about a year ago, and have really liked it -- for what it is designed for.  It is when you try to stretch it a bit, like I did, to get it to replace a beloved old Olympus OM-10 SLR I have had for 20+ years, you really start to understand the limitations of the current crop of digicams (to separate them from the still-too-expensive-for-my budget digital SLRs).  To Nikon's credit, they have produced a number of really nice accessory lenses and flashes for this camera, and its ability to make really close-up macro shots and assisted panoramas still astounds me.  Even with items like their wide-angle and tele-adapters, etc, though, there are still about three major shortcomings that will eventually force me to look at the new crop of under-$1000 digital SLRs that will be coming out in the next year or so.<br />1) Now matter how you cut it, a max F3.5/F5.6 (wide/tele) lens is too slow for any real handheld available light work, unless you are outdoors.  I've tried handholding indoor shots with it, and experienced too much camera shake because of the slow shutter speeds.  There is simply no substitute for a fast (F1.8 or better) prime lens when you need to get that shot without a glaring flash.<br />2) You would think that the slow lens situation would be helped by cranking up the ISO, say to 400.  Unfortunately, the noise at ISO 400 in this camera is unacceptable to me.  Again, to Nikon's credit, they have a really nice noise reduction function, that substracts a dark frame in the camera, but this doubles your time between shots, and that can be a real issue if say, you are snapping shots of the Disney electrical parade.<br />3) Electric zoom -- one word, ich!  It's OK for camcorders, where a jerky manual zoom is considered poor camera technique, but in a still camera, it only slows you down.  Forget trying to do action/sports photography with the camera.  Even if the focus could follow a changing scene (and it is no stellar performer, there), the zoom is glacial in comparison.  Give my a push/pull manual zoom ring on a fast lens anyday.<br />So, given all the limitations of such a system, it doesn't appear to be worth tossing all the cash into the camera, lens, and accessories, only to have an \"SLR-wannabee\".  The camera, etc. is bulky enough that I have to make a conscious decision to pack it for a trip, just like an SLR system would be.  Better to spend your cash on the smallest pocketable miniature digicam you can, like the super-small Canons or Minoltas (these days they produce excellent 3- and 4- megapixel pictures), and save your money for one of the newer digital SLRs coming out, if you are really yearning to 'go digital' and retire that trusted old SLR.  And don't forget that big investment in 'glass' you may have with your old SLR system.  Hopefully will be able to reuse some of it, until you can afford the truly astronomical prices that some of the new glass for digital SLRs are going for.","first the good:  it takes great pictures, the macro mode is better than most in its class, the swivel lens allows for some interesting setups.<br />the not so good:  low light pictures are not that hot, the lcd is very small, slow lens.<br />the story:  sure, i could sit and write more technical things but there are many websites out there that have detailed reviews of this camera that do a far more professional review.<br />this is (was) my third digital camera.  my first was a fuji 1 megapixel that i outgrew in no time.  the second was the canon a40 - a camera i still love and would recommend to anyone in the market for a great 2 megapixel camera (i believe it makes the best first camera).  then this.  when i first got the 4500, i was really excited and took pictures all day long.  you can do so much with all the manual controls and swivel lens.  but as time went on, i found myself using this camera less and less.  the reason?  the controls are too complicated - i had to keep reading the manual to figure out how to do this or that.  what's the point of all the features when you have to go through complicated menus every time you want to use some feature.  in the end, i gave up and bought a canon g3.  though i cant say the pictures it takes are any better, it is far easier to use.  to me (and to most others, i think) that is the most important thing.  you want good 8x10 prints but you also want to enjoy the trip/event.  the last thing you want is to be reading the camera manual with a flashlight at basecamp so you can get good pictures tomorrow on the hike.  do yourself a favor and get some other camera.","I spent a year using and abusing the 990 coolpix in severe conditions on the job and fell in love with it inspite of some flaws (Needed higher resolution, chromatic aberations were pretty nasty and the control/ menu system was written for geeks).<br />The 995 came out and I passed on it as I thought it should have had that higher resolution.<br />When the 4500 appeared, it seemed like it was everything I wanted. They simplified the controls (but they are still too clumsy), bumped up the resolution and made the whole thing smaller. But they also shrank the LCD window down to where it borders on useless. I am now planning on replacing this camera with the 5400 as soon as it comes out. I wish they had left that window alone...","I spent a year using and abusing the 990 coolpix in severe conditions on the job and fell in love with it inspite of some flaws (Needed higher resolution, chromatic aberations were pretty nasty and the control/ menu system was written for geeks).<br />The 995 came out and I passed on it as I thought it should have had that higher resolution.<br />When the 4500 appeared, it seemed like it was everything I wanted.

If I won a jackpot, I will have a Nikon's best camera :-)<br />Hi, Look at the photographers in sports arena, what they are using, most of them use Nikon, they are professionals, right?","I did alot of research before I bought this camera a year ago. The research has paid off dividends. First off this is a great Camera!!. I bought it for two main reasons. One was astrophotography and the other was just going on trips and tooling around.<br />Pros of this camera:<br />-Intuitive (after the manual is browsed) B+<br />-Picture Quality A+<br />-User controllability A++ (my cousin has the Fuji and you can't manually control anything, just a bunch of predefined settings. Alot of the other cameras were like this)<br />-up to 5 min of keeping the shutter open (nice for astrophotography, but you do need the remote for this)A+<br />-The Auto Focus is Great with even marginal light B+<br />-When you controll the settings yourself you can get very artsy with your photos (this is sort of cool)<br />Cons:<br />-In very low light situations the focus can have trouble but I have rarely noticed this, besides there is a manual focus if the light is way too dim, and I mean waay.<br />!!!ONE IMPORTANT SUGGESTION!!!!<br />If you decide to buy this camera buy one of those screw on UV filters. It has no negative effects in picture quality, only positive effects, and it can save your lense. After fifteen days of owning the camera I accidentally scratched the lense. It was minor but I was SOOOOO pissed after spending all this cash, so i tried to replace the camera through the in store warranty, but it was void by the time I found the scratch. So I bought a $15 UV filter and no scratches since. However, if I do get one, it's on a $15 dollar lense I can easily replace. Also Once you clean your primary lense and screw on the UV filter you won't have to clean under there until you remove it. It's a pretty cheap invesment for alot of benefit. Hope this review helped!","This is a camera for someone who likes to read the manual and undertand the truly amazing functionality.  Its features far exceed many other digital cameras at this price point, especially in manual modes.  The battery life is amazing. Glad we don't have to fool around with double a's anymore...<br />There are better options like Canon for the \"point-and-shoot\" only kind of person.","The swivel baffels some.  Besides the camera's crisp pictures this is one of the great features of this camera.  I can be standing in a crowd and swivel the lens 90 degrees from the screen and hold the camera arms length over my head and look up to frame a perfect picture over the heads of the spectators.  Great feature that wasn't obvious when I bought the camera.","For serious digital enthusiasts, this is an incredible machine for the money.  First of all, it has Nikon optics.  Nothing more needs to be said there.  The camera operates from a completely manual mode to complete automation.  The color rendition and saturation are extremely accurate and rich.<br />The negative items I've encountered after taking more than 1000 images are few and relatively minor.  First, as with most auto-focus devices, the camera works best in well lit conditions.  The pop-up flash unit is powerful, but it is delicate and needs to be treated gently.  And lastly, the navigation through the on-screen menus can be a bit tricky.<br />I'd recommend purchasing additional memory (I use a 256Mb card), because once you get used to the features, you will enjoy bracketing your shots to take advantage of the range of performance.","I have also owned a 950 series Coolpix before purchasing the 4500.  The bottom line is image quality -- the 4500 produces beautiful pictures if you know how to use it properly.  This a compact camera that's loaded with features.  The LCD screen is 1.5 inches, most are 1.8 -- I have no trouble seeing mine.  The menus are complex at first, but after you use it a while, the menus become simple and easy to navigate.  The wide range of settings requires an elaborate menu system.  If you're just going outdoors taking pictures during the day, point and shoot works perfect. The camera's weight with the battery is a little over 12 ounces.  I doubt that's going to wear someone's arm down.<br />If you're looking for a compact camera that takes sharp, colorful pictures, buy the Coolpix 4500.  To help you understand the ease of use - I'm in a wheelchair with limited arm movement and no finger movement.  I have no problems operating this camera.","I own a Coolpix 4500, before I had a 950 and a 995. I've been using them all a lot.<br />Coolpix 4500 Pros:<br />- Very good overall picture quality if you use the following settings:<br />1600 x 1200 resolution (downsampling algorithm does a great job - I usually shoot at 2 mp when travelling to save space without losing much quality); medium quality jpeg; sharpening +1<br />- Sturdy all metal swivel design body allows you all sorts of shots that would be impossible to take with other types of camera.<br />- Fits in pocket (even though it is not really slim)<br />- Best macro of all compacts - if you need close-ups, the Coolpix is about the best choice around<br />- Lens is not extending out of camera body, so it is well protected from mechanical damage and dust (look at all those flaky extensible plastic gadgets on other cameras!).<br />- Accessory lenses available, especially the teles are excellent<br />- Best choice of options available in compacts, everything can be adjusted according to personal taste. All sorts of exposure and focus options a modern higher end SLR has.<br />- Good lithium battery with fast 2 hour charger (get a spare battery, though!)<br />- Still good quality at 400, usable at 800 ISO!<br />- Histogram allows you to check exposure<br />Cons:<br />- Lens does not deliver enough detail to take full advantage of the chip's 4 megapixels. No improvement compared to 995 (3 mp).<br />- Little direct access to functions; you spend a lot of time fumbling<br />- Multi-level menus that are SLOW to navigate<br />- Slow lens (maximum aperture) at tele position); try 200 ISO whenever necessary<br />- Shutter delay too long (apparently slower than 995) for candid shots or anything that moves quickly<br />- LCD (1,5\") is too small, especially if you have eye problems; the 995 had a 1,8\", the 950 a 2\" screen!<br />- Distortion (pincushion at wideangle, barrel at tele)<br />- Does not focus well at low lighting levels (no AF assistance light)<br />- Clipped highlights (no detail in light areas while the rest is properly exposed; underexposing does not help much)<br />My conclusion:<br />I you want to shoot sports and under low light situations, or if you need the best resolution, get something else,<br />If you need to travel light, take close-ups, take pictures discreetly, need some more tele (with or without accessory lens) and are content with (very good) 2 megapixel pictures, get the Coolpix 4500.","From an overall standpoint, this camera is great. Just a few minor features I felt were annoying compared to the CanonG2 which was my other choice. 1) In full auto mode, the focus is always adjusting, and I felt that the battery or the lens motor would [...] out soon. It is now set to program mode and focuses only when I want it too. Not a bad compromise. 2) Focus time and shutter lag seem a bit longer compared to the G2, but just a little anticipation overcomes this limitation easily (trying to catch my 18 m/o boy in action indoors). 3) Flash not too powerful- I see this is a common gripe. Compared to my old Ricoh 4200, this thing is in supercruise mode! The macro mode is far superior to that of the G2's and 4x optical does make a difference to me over 3x. The rebate helped too.","I loved the cute little thing!  It took some great shots, but it was pretty feeble in large rooms.  The worst part, though, was that less than 18 months after I bought it, it died.  The \"shutter release\" (or whatever it's called on a digital camera) button ceased to work. Turns out, it's only a little plastic (plastic!) pin that taps a little spot on a very little digital connector, and if one or the other weakens structurally, the camera is kaput, as mine is.<br />I need a digital camera for my work, and I am thinking of moving up to the 4500, but if its shutter mechanism is no better than the 775's, I will have my very grave doubts.<br />...","I've been watching the Nikon Coolpix 900 series (900-995, now the 4500, all with twist feature) since they were introduced. The Coolpix 4500 is priced right, plus it has the resolution I want for enlarged photos. I have produced 15 x 11-inch exhibition prints with this camera. They are tack sharp.<br />One of the alluring features of this camera is that it is inconspicuous. You can take photos and it does not bring attention to itself. When I am shooting with a Nikon F100, sometimes an observer wants to know what I am shooting. He or she will even suggest what to shoot. When I am shooting with the 4500, fewer strangers, if any, intervene.<br />Sometimes I shoot from my kayak. When doing so, I like to shoot right at water level. With an slr camera, this is impossible. With the 4500, I can twist the viewfinder so I am looking down while the lens is facing my subject (grasses, lobster buoy, etc). With an optional viewing hood on the LCD I can see clearly despite the sun.  I am getting images I would not get otherwise.<br />You can also use this camera effectively in candid street photography. Use the twist feature and your subject will not suspect you are photographing him or her. Your subject can even be behind you.<br />This camera also takes an off-the-camera flash. I use a Nikon SB-28DX with my F100. This Speedlight is compatible with the 4500 as well. I have a bracket that holds the camera with the flash to the side with a sync cord attached. This feature, of course, eliminates red-eye and fosters more candid portrait photos.<br />I bought this camera primarily for its:<br />- 4-megapixel resolution,<br />- very sharp lens,<br />- 4x-optical zoom (compares to 38-155mm on a 35mm camera),<br />- 3/4 inch macro AF mode,<br />- twist feature,<br />- compatibility with my Nikon Speedlight,<br />- various drive modes (P, A, S, M),<br />- three-mode metering which includes spot,<br />- compatibility with auxiliary lenses, and its<br />- \"low-key\" appearance.<br />However, I am discovering all kinds of features I enjoy using. These include:<br />- a five-area multi-focus system,<br />- one-touch uploading of photos, and<br />- auto-exposure bracketing with white balance and exposure values,<br />- plus more.<br />Does this mean I will stop using my F100? No. I can create larger quality prints with the F100.  The two cameras complement each other. The 4500 enables me to experiment without the expense of film, see immediate results, then apply the features to the F100.  And, as mentioned, the 4500 enables me to get out-of-reach shots.","This camera came highly recommended by a relatively camera-savy friend, so I was a bit skeptical as most reviewers mention \"options buried deep in menus\" as a drawback.  Before this, the only camera (digital or film) I'd ever owned were those disposable \"fun-savers\", so I figuered my learning curve would be huge.<br />Turns out, I love this thing.  What sold me over the Canon G2 was the macro capabilities and the ring-light that was available, as I will be using it for both personal and dental (ie: macro) uses.  I dont' find the menus too complex or anything like that....most things are just 2-3 clicks away at the most, and the menus are easy to follow.  The ONLY negative I have found so far is that some things can \"wash out\" with the flash if taken 1-3 feet range, but you can avoid this by backing up and zooming in to the desired distance.  So many features, hopefully I will use them all someday!  Pictures are GREAT, close-up or landscapes.  Swivel is handy, too.  Hey, if I can use this thing, anyone can.","Not to sound like a negatron, but some of the previous reviewers aren't really qualified to comment on this camera.  It's features are wasted on them.  Too small?  Q: What is the best camera?  A: The one you take with you and always have in your hand.  Don't kid yourself-- if a camera is even slightly bulkly or cumbersome to haul around (as both the 990 and 995 are) you won't carry it and it will quickly migrate directly to your closet.  In this regard, the 4500 really shines.  Lightweight, portable, truly pocket-sized (i.e., you don't have to cram it in there and it doesn't feel like a brick thumping against your leg after 5 minutes).  Second, the swivel design is excellent for capturing candids.  You can hold the camera at your waist and fire off shots without anyone being the wiser.  No hands covering faces, no corny poses, just people as they are.  Try to get shots like that with a typical point-shoot or SLR.  Too mechancial?  Come on!  I suppose some people can't handle two moving parts.  Anyway, there is no need to twist the cam to take shots-- if you want to hold the camera up to your face like a typical point-and-shoot, in it's default position, nothing's stopping you.  It works great that way as well.  Trust me, there isn't anything 'weird' about this device that someone with an ounce of common sense can't handle.  Finally, this was a reasonably priced camera when it first came out.  Now, at the current price with all the discounts and rebates, it's a steal.  But yeah, if you're looking for solid quality at absolute bargain basement prices and the 4500 is too much, skip the 995 and go right to the 990.  That is the camera I used up until recently as a backup to my pro-grade D100 for model shoots.  The fact that an older model in this line has that sort of credibility should tell you something about the quality you can expect from the newer 4500.","I've ordered 8x10 prints of the high resolution, low compression picture and was very happy with the results.  Menu system is a bit complex at first, but I am used to it now.  At highest Res, .JPG images can be 400K, 800K or 1.2M depending on compression setting.  I have used the swivel lens to take pictures at odd angles and clearly see the LCD disply.  It was very useful.  Ability to display on TV for immediate review was very good quality.  May not be the smallest is certainly considered convenient.  I have no complaints yet!  I do recommend at least a 64Mb flash card.  ( I bought the 128MB and can fit about 100 1.2M pictures on a disk.)","Although this camera takes excellent pictures, I find it mechanically awkward to use.  The left half of the camera must be pivoted forward from top to straight ahead in order to find the subject in the lens.  Also the flash is located on that left pivotal half, so one must be careful to not be placing fingers on top of the flash when taking a picture. For quickness in shooting \"unreinactable\" pictures these mechanics are frustrating.  Anyone with lack of dexterity may find this camera a problem as I do.  I would suggest that anyone buying this as a gift be certain the receiver goes along! These mechanics may be uncomfortable to them--This is not user friendly for one who just wants to \"point and shoot\".  For this price I would like to see it more user friendly and less mechanical!","I used both this and the 995, and the 995 has a more solid feel, better grip, easier menu to navigate and larger LCD monitor. If you are getting something in this range, get a 995. It will be cheaper since it is an old model and although at 3.34megapixel, it is a minor difference. I just did exactly that!<br />If you take 100-200 high resolution (Fine, 3:2) photos with frequent use of flash in one outing, immediately get a couple of 256MB RAM cards and an extra rechargeable battery. With the money saved buying a 995, you can do this.<br />In both, the swivel action is very useful (360 degrees in this model) and the pop up flash is a great improvement from the 990! And the rechargeable battery is useful.<br />The 4500 is smaller and easier to stuff into your belt when cycling! It has a higher rating for optical zoom and resolution but I did not feel it was worth it. Much better to go for the 5700 if you can afford it, but that is much bulkier.<br />The 995 Nikon does very well with macro photography but is a little poor indoors compared to a Sony.","This camera is not outstanding at any one thing. Where it shines is that it can do just about anything and do it well. It is a compact take it along point and shoot camera, it is a close up camera and it is a field/studio camera with all the professional manual control you require for serious work. The split body makes it easy to shoot overhead, ground level and everything in between. I owned the prior camera, the Coolpix 995 and thought the design could never be improved upon. I was wrong.","I bought it in June, has taken a lot of pictures, the color quality is almost perfect, although the price is a little bit high now, with some promotion and free shipment from Amazon, it is still a good deal. Hi, guys! do not waste your time comparing among the cameras, real color comes first, Nikon's color is what you need !","Overall the 4500 is a solid camera with many advantages over the 995, however, the 995 hasd a few features that are missing or better than the 4500.<br />Pros of the 4500:<br />Scene modes-it is much quicker (less battery drain) to set the scene than it was with the 995.<br />User interface-while the LCD on top is gone it is still pretty easy to tell what options you have on for the mode you are in.<br />Video-Video with sound is nice and I thought I really needed it but so far not a big deal.  It is very nice to be able to shoot a little video but still shoot GREAT photos!<br />Pros of the 995:<br />The flash- While it required the user to extend the flash to use it, it seems more powerful and more effective at a greater distance than the 4500's flash.  I shoot many shots inside large dark spaces (caves and tunnels) where there is no power and a long ways from any roads so the flash is handy.  To overcome the 4500 flash I would need to buy both the SK-E900 ($70+) & an SB series flash like the 80DX ($325) OR a SB-22s ($115), so I can get a good flash for about $185 new.<br />Both cameras produces beautiful, crisp images and overall, you get a lot of camera for your money.<br />I would recommend getting a 256MB flash card (or bigger) and a spare battery (although I have yet to need it.)  I have been able to shoot over 100 photos with flash on most of them with both cameras on one fully charged battery.<br />Recommendation:  If you want the latest and the best go with the 4500, but if you want a good camera for a good price, check out the 995 at an online auction or Nikon's refurbished cameras at Nikonmall or Amazon for used.","I just traded up from my 995, and this one is far better.  The fit, and size along with new flash.  Not to mention the 16 scene mode.  Only down size is smaller screen, menu navigation, and skimpy 16mb card.  Overall dollar for dollar I don't think there is a better camera.","The most awe inspiring and versatile camera I have ever owned... and I have had quite a few. I am a graphic designer and this camera completes my studio nicely. I take mostly studio shots of fruits and still life and the detail and clarity is nothing short of amazing. There is only one downfall and that is, my finger seems to always be in the way of the pop up flash. Folks with large hands may find holding the camera a bit uncomfortable, but performance is top notch.","I didn't care much for the Coolpix 995 when it was out.  The 4500 (which is the 995's replacement) is much better in my opinion.  The body size has been greatly reduced.  Unfortunately that also resulted in a reduction in screen size, but I guess that was unavoidable.  Excellent image quality, excellent macro mode (3/4 inch!), good zoom.  It comes with a different battery charger, probably because the ones that were included with the 995 were awful (I work at a camera store and they came back defective all the time).  The software leaves something to be desired--invest in something like Adobe Photoshop Elements to do your editing.  Overall, a good camera.","While some of the Sony digital cameras will burn directly a mini CD, once it has been burned you cannot erase it! With CF cards you can review your photos and re shoot as many times as you like! CF card based cameras  are also faster in recording the image! But the previous reviewer forgot also one point! This camera just came out about a month ago, thus no way he could had used in his field research in Peru! Thus his review for this camera I would say is a bit invalid if not biast.<br />The Nikon 4500 is a much improved version of the 950-990 series, with more features and more user friendly. It is not a perfect camera, no camera is but it will give you very good results without to much know how. I biggest concern with Nikon digital cameras that they tend to be a bit blue biast, and I owned several digital Nikons, including 950, 995 and D100, thus a I recommend software designed for editing digital photos in which you can correct the proper color balance. Adobe Photo elements version 1 or 2 are good as well as Paintshop Pro 7. Apart from this minor problem, you will be happy with this camera as long as you get youself a 256 MB CF card, don't even bother with a 128 MB or less, the prices came down so much for the CF cards lately that you can pick up a good brand like Lexar or Viking for very little.","This Coolpix 4500 is my second Nikon digital camera. I'm still new to photography, but I can say that so far, the 4500 is an excellent camera.<br />The 4500 takes absolutely beautiful pictures, and the 16 modes go a long way to help novices take great looking pictures in all kinds of conditions. I like the new modes included over the Coolpix 885. The sports mode works well, and the panorama mode makes it very easy to create composite shots that look like they were created by a professional. Focusing is quick, and pop-up flash works well, and the camera feels solid.<br />Above all, it's pictures are amazingly detailed, with grat color reproduction. Highly recommended for novices and intermediate photographers alike.","Hi.<br />I've had a Coolpix 775, a Coolpix 995, the Canon Powershot S30 and now this one. The camera I liked the most (before this one) was the Coolpix 995, but it was way too bulky. The Powershot is a cool camera, but it doesn't feel the same, and the macros suck. This new Coolpix is smaller (not as a Powershot, but still small), stronger (all metal, cool!), and has 4 megapixels. It takes really awesome macros and has even more options than the 995. Who can ask for more?"]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 2000","amazon_reviews":["Great camera. It was so easy to use.

Value for money.","I chose the CP2000 over the 2500 at the time because of the AA batteries and the fact that the macro function was controlled from an external button rather than within the menu. I am glad I did on both counts.  Its been to New Guinea with me and on a 6 day bushwalk in Tasmania.  One set of NiMH batteries lasted five days of picture taking on the walk-then I popped in the second set and we were off again.  Infinity focus  (landscape) mode was really useful in taking pictures out of windows.  Macro is superb-changes the way I look at  of the world around me. I am constantly switching in and out of macro mode and value that macro button.<br />Cons include minimal buffer memory, so slow image processing and poor low light capability.  Its been a great introduction to digital photography and is leading me on to want more!!!!","The Coolpix 2000 is my first digital camera. For the money, I can't imagine a better camera out there. I bought it at Amazon.com, and with the low price they have on it (then figure in the rebate from Nikon) how can you beat it? It is a Nikon product, and has their usual quality.<br />If you go through the manual, and view the info CD that comes with it, you will be taking superb pictures in no time.<br />I had a little trouble with blurriness when taking pictures in low light at first, but all you need to do is use the correct setting, and use a tripod. There is a little \"hand shake\" symbol that pops up in the display whenever you run into a situation that a steady hand is required to achieve a sharp picture. I found that a tripod is the ticket for those situations. Tripods are a cheap and wise investment.<br />As for the battery life...no big deal. It will accept an external power pack plug-in if you need to use it for extended periods. I bought a 7.5 volt Digicom model and it works great. You can take a TON of pictures on it without fear of it going dead. You will still need to pick up a charger and a couple of sets of rechargable AA batteries for the times where you use it for only an hour or two at a time. Forget about using any non-rechargable batteries. You would go broke in a hurry!<br />Just set it so that it will automatically shut itself off after  30 seconds or one minute (there are a few settings for different auto shut off durations available).<br />Compared to the way we used to go about it (buy film, pay for development, then sort through and save only the \"good\" shots), this is a far better way to go.<br />If you want to view the pictures on your tv (like the old projector slide shows we used to sit through as kids) you can just plug it into the TV, and run through any shots stored on a card. We find ourselves doing this a lot after family outings to help determine which pictures we want to print out. There is never a shortage of opinion!<br />By the way, You will want to pick up a bigger capacity CF card or two. I went with a 128 mb card, and that is enough for my usage. You can take about 132 pictures in the highest quality settings with it. It will store well over 200 on the second highest quality settings (still extremely good quality for 5 X 7 photos).<br />I suppose there are a few flaws as expressed in some of the other reviews, but why worry? This a great camera from a great company for a great price. In its price range, I doubt if you can touch it (and I shopped). Buy one!","...I bought this for my Dad six months ago. Unless you're one of those people cursed with the inability to set the clock on your VCR or microwave oven, this is an awesome camera for the price; and by one account, better than a more expensive camera. I have a friend who was disappointed with his high-end Coolpix (5700?). I've had none of his problems (night shots, zoom). With a little practice and study I've taken every shot I've wanted to take: indoors, slow shutter adjustment; outdoors, fast shutter adjustment for too bright light; outdoors: the moon, with long shutter; zoom; outdoors in the daytime: telephoto shots of billboards, urban shots; a series of dramatic sunrise shots in Southern California using FINE and highest resolution settings -- and more. I have transferred both still shots AND movies (MOV) to my TV and VCR, and so on. As for the complaints about lack of viewfinder -- that's balony. My dad may very well be the worst snapshot photographer on the planet, having previously attempted to use film cameras with viewfinders. This is the first camera he's ever owned that allowed him to take decent -- even great -- photos -- and he's over 90 years old! Finally, he takes photos without his index finger taking center stage.<br />It has a tendency to suck up batteries, but, yeah? ...And gasoline in California is expensive. Technology has costs. Sorry.<br />One thing I bought on the outside was the AC power adapter (EH-53, I think: look it up) for [$$$]. That's very handy for downloads and particularly many indoor shots and transferring to video (video transfer cable included). The more familiar I became with the Coolpix 2000, the better battery life I got, since I didn't waste battery time on the settings. You'll use 2 sets or 3 sets of four AA batteries getting the hang of it. Both of my brohters bought this exact same model after they saw my results.<br />The software is typically crappy : just what I have learned to expect! If you're gonna take digital photos in this day and age, then you're probably going to use some digital imagery software, such as Adobe products, or Mindworkshop (Alchemy) or Paintshop Pro (like I do).<br />I got this camera through Amazon.com ...and with a bonus 32 mb compact flash -- and it was a sweet deal.<br />Oh! The product tutorial on CD is the best I've ever seen. The booklet is exhautive, and is available online in PDF format from Nikonusa (or something like that).<br />After a few months of using it, I realized that it has a focus setting for super close-ups (which I liked so much on my DLINK  350).<br />Works flawlessly on Windows 98 Second Edition, even using battery power to download. On Windows 2000 Pro, I had problems downloading. The problems were reduced by using the AC adapter, but sometimes I had to download more than once.<br />Yeah. Good camera.<br />BTW. My dad can't set the clock on the VCR, but he takes good photos with this camera on the AUTO setting, both indoors and outside.","The Coolpix 2000 is a easy-to-use digital camera with two important features: 3x optical zoom and great picture quality.  However, it lacks an optical viewfinder, so you must use the LCD screen to shoot pictures -- which is awkward and annoying. I thought this problem was gone on all but the cheapest DCs.  Guess not. Also, the CompactFlash memory card is hard to remove. Another problem is that the path to deleting photos is a little confusing at first. Be FOREWARNED: Battery life is the worst I've ever seen, and this is the third digital camera I'ved owned and about the sixth or seventh that I've operated on a regular basis. It's a good camera to keep in the car for emergencies or to use for work.  If you're serious about digital photograpy, though, spend a little extra on a [more expensive camera]. You'll be happy you did. My wife owns a 2300 and I bought this, so I'm a bit disappointed.","The Coolpix 2000 is a easy-to-use digital camera with two important features: 3x optical zoom and great picture quality.

It is small, light weight, and EASY to use. Like all Nikon cameras it takes great pictures. Unless you're making posters, 2 MegaPixels is all you'll ever need to take snap shots or even 5 x 10's.","I bought this camera for my fiance for Christmas so we could take it on our honeymoon in January.  The pictures turned out pretty well.  They aren't the sharpest pictures but they are at least as good as (if not sharper) than 35mm pictures.<br />The viewing screen is impossible to see in the dark, you just have to point and shoot and hope for the best.  Most people don't know how to use digital cameras yet so when asking someone to take a pic of us, we got our heads chopped off many times.<br />This wouldn't be a bad camera for a beginner or a casual picture taker.","I got this thing on special at $... That came with a 32m flash card free on promotion.<br />When I finally received this baby, I just could not put it down. I played with it until I could not find anything to photograph.<br />It's fairly easy to figure on the buttons as well, without having to read the manual. I started taking picture and transfering them to my notebook before I even read the manual.<br />The manual is very nice written, precise and written in an easy to understand language. Once I read the manual, which took less than an our, I was using my Coolpix 2000 like I have owned it for a year.<br />This scene modes make it easy to take quality pictures under any type lighting. With the right sceme mode, I have yet to take a picture that's too bright or too dark.<br />The red eye reduction works pretty well too. I turned off all the lights at my place and took pics of my girfriend in the dark. The results were good. I noticed though that from the side it does not work too lekker. Anyway, it's red eye redution not elimination.<br />I did not use the software that came with the camera. I think it's not necessary if you're using Windows XP. It's just another package that fills up much needed drive and memory space.<br />The LCD display is very clear, even under bright light. The screen updates very quickly as well, so you can move the screen around a lot and still not have to wait while it catches up.<br />For an amateur, this camera is an excellent buy. It pretty much does everything for you and still takes excellent quality pics. I was not too impressed with the sticker that Nikon has put on the front of the camera and I could do without th noise from the zoom lens.","Nikon's line of digital cameras has been good, and the 2000 is a great bang for the buck. The camera is not the sleekest around, nor the lightest, but it gives you a lot of features and control for not too much money. You can point and shoot, or take more control over the photos you take. Right out of the box, you can start taking pictures, and then expand to higher capacity memory cards and longer life batteries. The optical zoom is superior to the digital zoom that you find on many cameras in this range. Most of the controls are on the right hand side of the camera, with a large open grip space in the front so pictures can be taken with one hand. And the picture quality is exceptional for a camera at this price point. Overall this is a very good bargain for the hobbyist who wants to record the family vacation or experiment in the world of digital images. A solid leader.","This camera is great.  UPS delivered it today and I have been bowled over by all the features that I didn't know it had.  The photos are very sharp--I can't imagine needing more than 2 megapixels.  The 20-second video mode is neat, too.  The camera does use batteries like crazy though.  Using the LCD instead of the viewfinder takes some adjustment, but is superior in my opinion.  The LCD is super-bright and crisp.  After using it for a short time today, I have already gone through the supplied Panasonic batteries!  I recommend some powerful rechargable batteries for this unit.","I got this digital camera as a gift. It was very easy to get started and it was no trouble figuring out how to use it. Its controls are easy and taking pictures are no problem.","GREAT camera for the money! Has tons of extra shooting modes, very customizable photos, easy to use interface (even my dad could figure it out the first night using it!). Good investment for family & students, 2MP is more than enough for most home user applications. Sure, the zoom lens is noisy but for the price it's great that it even has zoom! GREAT JOB NIKON!","I've had my camera for about two weeks and love it.  Excellent pictures.  It is extremely easy to use.  I was able to use it without reading the manual.  Easy to review your photos, delete if you want, etc.  The manual is very concise and easy to understand, and gives lots of useful tips.  The more advance features are very easy to use and easy to remember so you don't have to cart your manual around with you everywhere.<br />It does suck up the non-rechargable batteries.  I got two sets of rechargable batteries and haven't had to go into the 2nd set yet even though I've taken lots of photos and a few little movies.  Very easy to download onto the computer.  I haven't yet installed the software that came with the camera.  Accessories are pretty inexpensive.  ...  The card reader is nice to be able to move your photos off the card onto the computer really quickly.<br />The only drawback is the LCD viewer is the only way to see what you're take a photo or movie of.  In bright light and at certain angles it's a tad hard to see but I'm getting used to it quickly and probably won't mind it at all later.  I can hold out the camera and take a decent photo even if I can't really see clearly what I'm taking a photo of.","pros: small but powerful, good image quality, easy to use menu, nice software and computer interface.<br />cons: no preview window, no carrying case.","Nikon Coolpix camera is the way to go, if you don't want to spend a fortune on a camera.  You can preview pictures, change settings, but the only thing I don't like about this camera is that it eats up batteries!  Please consider getting a Battery Pack with it!","This camera has many good features I have used so far and many I haven't learned yet.  The camera is easy to use if you don't want to spend a lot of time with the CD's and included manual.  But the extra features are there if you want to get a little deeper, which I plan to do when I have the time.<br />Sharp pictures, ease of use, TV out, and enough extra settings and features to keep you going for a while.  The only reason I didn't rate this five stars is because the batteries that came with the camera lasted about an hour.  I bought a charger and some NiMH batteries and they seem to do the trick.","This is my first digital camera but I had the chance to compare this against other cams owned by friends & family. I've been using it for a little more than a month now, here are my \"results\" ;)<br />Positive notes go to...<br />Picture quality:<br />Great. Details are crisp & colors are natural.<br />Ok pictures are a little overexposed when the flash goes on in a mildly lit environment, but I had this problem with my old-fashioned \"analog\" camera as well and advanced photographers can use the exposure settings to minimize this.<br />Features:<br />Great. This camera has every feature I need. It has a wide variety of settings & option, you can record \"animations\" (no sound), etc... In addition the user interface is clear & user-friendly.<br />Design:<br />Looks ok, handles great. A little bulky but not oversized.<br />Negative aspects...<br />Battery:<br />Battery life is low. This is the main drawback: as you can't switch the TFT view off (no optical viewfinder), batteries die rather quickly. They don't last more than 1-2 days under moderate use. Maybe using rechargeable lithium batteries might help, but I haven't tried it yet. So if you use this while traveling, be sure to bring in 2 sets of 4 rechargeable batteries with you. You'll probably have to change batteries every day. Because of this, you'll have to carry spare batteries everywhere you go... Grrrr...<br />Software included:<br />Nikon's software was really lame. My brother's Sony has much better software. I uninstalled everything and now I'm only using XP's built in features.<br />Overall...<br />This is a great camera if you don't mind the battery life that might fall a little short. But my brother's Sony doesn't last much longer either. This is maybe a common problem among all digital cameras. But it's worse here because you don't have the alternative to use an optical viewfinder...<br />Still if you don't want to spend much and if excellent quality pictures are more important than long battery life, give it a try!"]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 5700","amazon_reviews":["The controlling program is very slow even more if you use the fill-in flash.

The optics are why you buy Nikon, and this is one sharp lens.  It's complicated to operate if you want to do manual settings (M, A, S), but the Program mode will suffice for most people.  It will shoot in RAW mode, unusual for a consumer camera.  That gives you a lot of flexibility in adjusting the image.  If you're not willing to read the manual though, this may not be the camera for you.  Sort of like driving a manual transmission, it's so easy once you know how but you have to give it the effort to practice.<br /><br />Nikon supports this camera with repair if you have problems, flat rate is reasonable (go to Nikon USA direct, dealers mark up).  One common problem is the CCD failing, due to a Sony image sensor that a lot of camera makers used.  Free repairs in about 2 weeks, but it's annoying.  After that fix, this is a solid camera.  I like mine, and shoot a lot of quick shots with it.","I bought this camera after many years of owning a Nikon FM-2.<br /><br />This camera and those like it fill a gap for those who do not want to invest in a Digital SLR system. Yet have some control over the camera.<br /><br />If you can get by with 5 Megapixles this is a good camera.<br /><br />If you can, buy the filter set and the adapter because it not only protects the lens but also protects the zoom mechanism.<br /><br />Buy or find the MB-E5700 battery pack which letts you use 6 AA Lithium batteries or rechargables. This gives you the best power option. (Turn off the continuous Autofocus and you will save power galore!)<br /><br />No serious photographer uses on camera flash. You can turn off the flash on the camera and get a Speedlight.<br /><br />The camera takes a while to master if you want to use all the features.<br /><br />The metering for exposures is near perfect. The problems in low light can be overcome with some simple steps.<br /><br />Set the focus on infinity for long distances shots.<br /><br />Use the focus lock to lock onto something with contrast in low light situations. This is the camera's Achilles heel.<br /><br />The Camera in not a pro camera and will take time to shoot download hi-res photos to memory.<br /><br />I have been very pleased with camera and the results. I would like to have a Nikon D200 but do not want to spend that much.","I have had my Coolpix 5700 for several years and rarely go anywhere without it. It takes great pictures unless there is low light. It is impossible to get decent shots in the late evening or in the house. The controls are pretty complicated, but I leave almost everything on auto and this works most of the time. It is a very tough camera and has taken a LOT of abuse from me (including being dropped on bricks from a few feet up). I love my camera but it is not for the casual user.<br /><br />Buy 2 batteries! Always keep one on the charger and you will be thankful.","I purchased the E5700 back when its cost was around $975. It was money well spent. My amateur and semi-pro photography career has spanned three decades, so I've seen some good and many bad cameras over the years. The CP5700 is one of the best, IMO.<br /><br />This was my first digital camera -- moving from a 35mm SLR (Canon A-1) to a pro-sumer digi. Although a bit smaller than the A-1, the CoolPix 5700 still feels pretty substantial in my hands. The feature set allows for full auto (Aperture, Shutter, Program) and full manual shooting. I also love the fact that I can carry ONE camera and take color OR B&W photos. The BEST thing about the Nikon 5700 is the screen. While it is not nearly as large as some newer models, it is the most versatile I've ever encountered. The screeen swivels in ALL directions -- making it possible to compose photos from ANY angle. In fact, I use it frequently to take overhead and on-the-ground pics. AWESOME!<br /><br />Add an SB flash, or a battery pack and you're ready for pro-shooting. I would advise one thing though -- *IF* you can't find the 5700 for under $525, I would suggest stepping up to the CoolPix 8700 (same camera, but 8MP) for a little more $$$.<br /><br />BTW, one problem often seen on the 5700 is the scrambled screen. Nikon will repair and clean the camera FREE of charge if that is the problem. I had mine done recently -- 8 days total turnaround. Lastly, the lens error most people experience is their own fault. They put the camera in a camera bag that's too small or turn it on in a confined space -- thus messing up the lens motor. In almost four yrs of owning the 5700, I have had ONE lens error message -- and it was 100% MY fault.","I had a Coolpix 5700 for a little over a year and was very satisfied with the pictures it takes. I would advice owners to definitely read the manual. You should also get an external flash. This will do wonders for your pictures in low light settings. I only sold my camera because I purchased a Canon dSLR. The Nikon's zoom capability, quality pictures, and many manual functions are excellent, but you must read the manual to take advantage of the camera.","If you are looking for an entry level professional camera, save up and buy an SLR. I have had this camera for a little over a month and am ready to throw it out the window.<br /><br />AUTO FOCUS PROBLEMS<br /><br />The thing can't take a picture that's in focus.  At one to one, out of the 958 pictures I've taken, none of them are sharp.  It simply can't do it.  Many subjects it can't focus at all.  Its impossible to judge from the tiny monitor the true sharpness of the photo. Its not uncommon to review a batch of photos on the computer and find that half of them are completely fuzzy.<br /><br />The auto focus is also extremely slow.  It can take several seconds for the camera find its mark.<br /><br />MANUAL FOCUS IS A JOKE<br /><br />The manual focus is awkward to use.  Although, that's prety much irellevant because the camera's monitor does not have enough resolution to use it.  Its been suggested to me that I try bracketing the focus.  Except, the point of bracketing is not to be aimlessly wasting memory, hoping that one of the shots is good.<br /><br />TIGHTEST APERATURE IS 8.7<br /><br />I thought I could deal with this because most of the work I do is in moderate to low light.  That was a mistake.  This compounds the previously mentioned Auto Focus issues.<br /><br />HIGH RESOLUTION<br /><br />The difference from a 35mm film scan is astounding.  Its amazing to pull up a 6X9 at 300 ppi with no noise or grain.<br /><br />EASY TO USE<br /><br />The camera is set up like the 35mm SLR I've used for years to and have found it easy to navigate.  The buttons on the side can be touched accidentally causing some minor annoyance.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />If you are a casual user, this camera may be just fine for you.  The focusing issues become pronounced when you are trying to achieve a specific aestetic.  Perfect focus may not be that important to you eighter, especially if you print mostly to 4x6 or 5x7.  Looking at  the other ratings, many people love this camera.  However, the serious amateur or entry level proffesional should not waste their time and money on this camera.","I've had my Nikon 5700 for about nine months now. I started out with it as a complete novice, got shutter lucky, and found some beautiful shots in the camera. Over the past months I've moved from a completely automatic point-and-shoot snapper to all-manual settings. I've picked up some knowledge about the basics of photography along the way, and the ability to pop the card and see the results of a setting instantly really shortened the learning curve.<br /><br />First and foremost, this camera takes absolutely beautiful photographs. Colors are bright and vibrant, and details are rendered beautifully even when printing at large sizes - you can get a 13x19\" enlargement to print at about 140 dpi on an inkjet, resulting in a very \"painterly\" image somewhere between photograph and painting. I decided at the outset to shoot only in camera RAW mode, and so what I've gotten out of the camera is exactly what went in. If you need to re-touch in Photoshop, this is the ONLY way to do it. You can correct a surprising number of mistakes (white balance, exposure, brightness, contrast, saturation) in RAW prior to bashing the image to smithereens with Photoshop editing tools - they only work on processed, \"rendered\" images.<br /><br />Downsides are well id'd in the reviews, but I think you can get around most of them. Battery consumption climbs closer and closer to the top of the list of negatives as you move from automated to manual operation. Tip: use manual focus. I've found that assigning manual focus to the function button on the top makes focusing easier than punching for the button on the lens barrel. There isn't anything you can do about slow memory card writes, and we're not likely to see any firmware updates to accept the faster WA cards out on the market.<br /><br />I've added some filters and lenses to my rig. A good tripod is essential, and the AA battery pack, with a 15-minute charger, makes everything a lot more fun. Note that if you add Nikon lenses, you are permanently out of luck for filters - there are NO filters for the Nikon lenses and adapters that fit this camera. Luckily, there are very acceptable third-party lenses and adapters that will take UV and/or polarizing filters.<br /><br />I'm no pro, don't even consider myself a photographer yet, but the folks who work with my wife don't know that. It's because of the pictures - they're gorgeous.<br /><br />The more time and effort you invest in this camera, the more you'll get out of it.","I simply love this camera.  It has everything I want. I especially like to play with the shutter speed and aperture in Manual mode.  This is when you can really get creative with your photos.  Although in auto mode, it does a super job.  I bought this camera for it's manual capabilities and the many accessories you can add to it.  I strongly recommend to only buy Nikon accessories.  They are pricier but you know you are not getting anything generic or substandard.  I also highly recommend taking the time to learn it and read the manual.  This way you will be able to use the camera to its full potential.  Many of other reviewer's \"frustration\"  come from the fact that they didn't take the time to learn the camera.  Also, if you take it to your nearest camera dealer, they will be more than happy to show you it's many awesome features.","If you are attracted to the Coolpix 5700 by the attractive price, you should keep in mind that this SLR-type digital camera first came out 2.5 years ago, which in digital photography chronology was more like the days when the dinosaurs roamed the earth.<br /><br />The 5700 is by no means an incapable camera. It has 5 megapixels, 8x optical zoom (which gives a range of 35-280 in 35mm equivalent), a swivel LCD screen, and electronic viewfinder (EVF).  EVF shows you what the lens sees, so this is an SLR-type camera, except the lens cannot be changed.  The built-in Nikkor lens is actually very high-quality and is designated ED by Nikon: the ED stands for extra-low dispersion, refering to the high-quality glass used to make the lens.<br /><br />The lens, in fact, is the best part of the 5700 at the after-rebate price: if you want to get a professional-quality zoom lens for a low, low price, the 5700 gives you a lot of bang for the buck, so you are basically getting a capable 5MP digital camera for free.  On the other hand, the 5700 is showing its age in other departments: auto-focus capability (esp. problematic in low light situations), processing speed, shutter lag, etc.  More recent models such as the Coolpix 8400, 8700 and 8800 have better functions and are better supported by Nikon, and also have better picture quality plus more pixels.  (Remember: pixel count does not equal picture quality, just like hard drive capacity has nothing to do how fast a computer is.)<br /><br />In summary, while the 5700 was top-of-the-class two years ago when I first played with it -- and its professional zoom lens is fantastic -- it's showing its age as a digital camera and is effectively a discontinued model.  If you want an SLR-type digital camera, consider the newer Coolpix 8400, 8700 and 8800 or the latest G-series from Canon or other similar cameras from Fujifilm or Konica Minolta.<br /><br />On the other hand, for semi-serious photography without spending too much money, the after-rebate 5700 makes a terrific value.","My family fulfilled a dream Christmas, 2003 when they gave me the Nikon Coolpix 5700.  Upsides: 1. This camera delivers fantastic results. 2. It feels good in the hand. 3. It's compact for its power.  4. Good price for the quality.  Downsides: 1. The built-in flash is a joke.  It's way under-powered.  2. The digital zoom is also a joke...obviously added only to be competitive on marketing comparison lists.  3. Nikon Service is structured in such a way that it's almost impossible to talk to a person and the back-and-forth of impersonal response forms with no person's name on them and no phone number is enough to make me move to another company's product line for my next camera.<br /><br />On the last day of our trip in June, 2004, to Yellowstone National Park, my Coolpix 5700 stopped powering up.  When we got home, I logged onto the [...] and followed the links to warranty service.  After shipping my baby off to Nikon, I received one of those form letters in the mail, informing me that the repair would cost $203.00 dollars and listing -$203.00 warranty allowance with a net of $00.00.  No additional information of any kind about the problem.  (In other words...\"Trust us\")  At the bottom of the form were instructions for logging in to nikonusa.com and approving the repair.  Ok...since there are no charges, they're going to sit on my camera and not repair it until authorized to do so?  Exactly why did they think I sent it to them anyway?  So I logged in and clicked in the approval checkbox.  The window went away and gave me no response of any kind either there or in email to indicate acknowledgement of the approval.  So what if the web connection malfunctioned?...or the programming was less than stellar?  How would I know except that my camera would never be repaired?  A week later, I received my baby in the mail...took it out of the box and read the included form (yes, another form with no contact name).  It said two boards had been replaced.  I turned it on and it came alive!  I tried to take a photo...but couldn't!!! because they obviously had not tested it and the entire panel of adjustment buttons on the left side of the camera were non-functional!!!  At this point, I'm not very happy.  There was an 800 number on the form returned with the camera and I actually was able to speak with a live person and explain the problem.  She was wonderful and sent me a pre-paid shipping form in email.<br /><br />I sent it back (per instructions) and am right back where I started with trying to get some response or information out of the nameless corporate entity.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  I love my camera...I hate the way the Service web pages have been programmed and the protective walls that have been put up to prevent me from talking with a live person.  Dear Nikon...if you won't talk to me, just who do you think is going to buy your next camera line?","Bought this camera from Amazon in April, 2004.  Had used only 35mm SLR's before--this was my first digital and was highly recommended by a friend.  For the price (I did get the $150 rebate) I think it is EXCELLENT after using it for 4 months.  And I haven't begun to use many of the advanced things it will do.","I love my coolpix camera. It is very easy to use and close to professional quality. Great Job Nikon!","I've had the camera about a year, and have used it extensively for nature photography with good success, particularly for macro work. The swiveling viewscreen is particularly useful for shooting stuff close to the ground (bugs and flowers, usually), and the long zoom is great for animal and bird shots. I usually shoot in jpeg mode at the highest resolution, with 128 mb of memory.<br /><br /> There are a few deficiencies, things that should be better in in a camera that's that expensive:<br /><br /> The lens could be sharper, especially at long zoom settings. Comparing similar shots from another long zoom digital that sells for half the price, the cheaper camera was noticably sharper.<br /><br /> Battery life is poor, less than half the life I get with another camera that uses four NIMH AA's.<br /><br /> Both the viewfinder and view screen could be brighter. When shooting in sunlight, it's pretty much a guessing game to compose a shot. I've resigned myself to shooting lots of exposures and sorting them out after downloading to the computer.<br /><br /> Autofocus doesn't work very well in macro mode, and, with the dim viewscreen, manual focus is pretty much impossible.<br /><br /> I still like the camera, it's excellent for family pictures, scenics, and the more mundane stuff, but comes up a bit short when you push its capabilities. More and more I'm using the other digital camera I own for macro work (it has a dedicated super macro mode), and get about an 80 percent yield of acceptable pictures, compared to maybe 50 percent with the Nikon 5700.","As a novice shutterbug, a simple point & shoot digital was fine at first, but as I gained confidence, and became a little more serious, I found that I had quickly outgrown my Cannon A40.  The Nikon 5700 seemed to be exactly what I needed, so I purchased one.  To say I love the camera, would be an understatement!  I'm still learning how to do what I want to, but being completely self-taught as far as photography, I understand there will be a learning curve.  The features are supurb, without being overwhelming.  While I'm sure the professional would consider it \"not enough\"... it more than suits my needs as my \"hobby\" grows.  Perhaps one day, I'll want/need/be ready for a high end camera, but for under 1K, this one will definately help me develop my skills for quite some time!","After reading these reviews I am starting to wonder if we are even discussing the same camera; people either love it or hate it. I am of the former persuasion: I really love this camera. No, it's not perfect, but all in all it is the best digital non-SLR machine I've ever used. First I'll discuss the things I'm not happy with; then I'll cover the features of which I am. After that section I'll address some of the complaints that I've read in some of the other reviews.<br />Let's get started:<br />What don't I like? I do wish the buttons on the side of the barrel were moved as they are a bit too easy to push by mistake, though once you get used to their location that sort of goes away. I also wish the tripod mount was directly in-line with the lens, not in the middle of the bottom of the case (though to be fair, that's the way it is with most cameras).<br />Nikon refers to the included 16 MB Compact Flash card (think of it as your digital film, if you aren't familiar with the digital camera world) as a \"starter card\"; and that unfortunately is true. 16 MB only holds 12 pics at 5 megapixels.. For the price of this instrument I strongly feel Nikon could include a larger capacity card; 64 MB or higher would be ideal but I'd settle for 32. Finally, it would be nice if the camera would accept other forms of media in addition to the compact flash or micro drive. However, this final observation isn't really a major complaint. It's more like a wish.<br />The things I love<br />Picture quality is first rate! The color and clarity of the pics are superb, as is the tolerance of slight hand shake. I've taken quite a few snaps where I've known I moved my hand a little at the last moment, and the pics came out razor sharp (not so with other cams). It has auto bracketing (it will take a series of shots that vary between a range you select for white balance/exposure, adjusting slightly between shots, and display the results with the data, allowing you to choose which is the most satisfying), best shot selector (you hold the shutter release button down and the 5700 takes a series of pics-up to 10-and saves the best focused to the card), image sharpening, noise reduction, and about a million other settings. It also allows you to save up to three sets of options or settings as \"user settings\", so you can recall the settings with just one menu choice, instead of resetting everything again.<br />One of my favorite features is the macro mode. You can take sharp amazing snaps up to 3 cm or 0.8\". If any of you are interested in seeing a sample, send me an email.<br />The printed user guide is good; not great, but good. I haven't seen any that were better, and quite a few that were worse. You could buy a third party guide to the 5700, and they are usually worth the price, as they give you tips and lessons that the manual doesn't include. Also, the Nikon web site has a multimedia manual/lesson feature for the 5700, and it is a very good overview and covers the basics well. This is provided free of charge.<br />The case is metal, which makes it feel substantial and allows the quality of the build to come through. I don't feel that it is too small, in fact, it feels pretty much just right and I am rather ham-handed. I also love the fact the camera can save in the RAW format for use in programs such as Photoshop CS. Working with RAW images really opens the field of creativity.<br />Complaints Others Have Expressed<br />The most common seems to be the auto-focus at low light. I've not had any trouble at all with this feature. I've taken pics in pretty dim areas and the AF worked fine. I wonder if the folks who had problems had the selected the correct settings; a read of the manual could solve the apparent problems. In addition, you can turn the auto-focus off and use the manual (focus)<br />I've also read some have found the buttons confusing. Now here I feel I must get on my soapbox. \"Prosumer\" level cameras are called such and cost the amount they do because of the quality of the images as well as the user controlled settings/features/options. If you are going to spend the kind of cash these machines cost, then it only makes sense to devote some time to learning how everything works. Any camera at this level is similar, there are just too many options to be able to make everything appear when/where every single user expects them to.<br />I've taught enough people to know that some folks become very frustrated very quickly no matter what the subject. If this is you then I suggest you avoid the Coolpix 5700 or any of the other cameras at this level; you'll just drive yourself nuts. There are a number of good quality point and shoot models in the market and these will be a much better match. If you are one of the folks who enjoys learning new things and the challenge of such, then these types of cameras are great. In the case of the 5700 I found the menus quite intuitive; however, you do have to read the manual to get an overview of how the camera works.<br />Some people also complained about the battery life. I've not experienced any problems. In fact, I own dig cams from Kodak, Olympus, Pentax and Canon, and all operate about the same as the 5700.","this is my first digital camera, and the first attemp to use it was frustrating, there were so many buttons, and so many menus to explore; then after an hour reading the manual, I learn how to use all the controls and now I taking pictures like crazy, probing all the features, wich by the way are endless. Anyway, the best choise, outstanding quality in every picture, somewhat noisy, nothing too important to care anyway, and tons of options for every situation.<br />At first the shots may seems a litle oversaturated, but with a few settings being adjusted, it's perfect. >the RAW format offers you a great amount of data to work with in graphic programs, such as photoshop (its fully supported in photoshop cs).<br />The 8x zoom it's of great help. and the digital 4x zoom has his benefits too. The memory card it's not enough for this machine. Buy a 256mb or more, and make sure you get one with fast writing speed in case you're planning to go RAW.<br />Finnally, the Nikon warranty it's international, so it's perfect for those who don't live on the US, or travel very often.","I purchased this camera when it first came out based on the rave reviews of the photo quality.  Indeed, it takes great photos.  However, there are some basic design flaws and ommisions that I felt were critical enough to get rid of it and replace it with a different camera.<br />  The location of some the buttons is just wrong.  It is easy to inadvertently change a setting just by trying to hold the camera.<br />The setup and menus are VERY complicated...much more confusing that any of the 5 other digicams I've owned.  It also doesn't alow you to rotate the photos for correct display on a TV set....even my $300 Canon does that....and the Canon automatically displays each photo correctly.<br />  The most significant ommision, however, is the lack of a focus assist-lamp for low-light conditions.  Since it's virtually impossible to manually focus a digital camera, you need a reliable auto-focus.  We found that even in modest low-light settings we couldn't get it to focus.  My wife was so frustrated with it that she wouldn't even use it.  We replaced it with a Canon which we are very happy with.","Before you begin reading, if you are thinking of buying the 5700 or the 8700. Don't. The Nikon D70 is out and nothing can compare to a true SLR. If you still want to read go ahead.<br />Having shot close to 5,000 pictures with this camera, take my word for it, the Coolpix 5700 is an excellent camera. It does however have a few limitations which stop me from recommending it whole heartedly. Lets start with the negatives first.<br />1. At anything above ISO 200 film speed the pictures start showing a lot of noise (this however is true with almost all digital cameras). However if you get a regular sized printout of your picture the noise is not that apparent, blowing up the picture is another matter though. Also if you're always going to keep the camera on auto mode, you need not worry about this problem, the folks at Nikon know the limitations of the camera and don't let it go into higher film speed modes in automatic mode.<br />2. The enormous amounts of options, menus, buttons etc. can be bewildering at first. Again if you're only pointing and shooting on auto mode, this is not that worrisome a problem. And honestly i bought the camera specifically because it had so many options! Having said that Nikon could have found better ways to get to the most useful options quickly. This camera almost rules out spontaneous picture taking because by the time you've set it up the way you want it, the moment is long gone.<br />3. The 32 MB card included with the camera is way too small. 256 MB would have been better. IBM's 1GB Microdrive is best.<br />4. In low light conditions the Coolpix gets confused and finds it hard to focus quickly. Migrating from a film based SLR (also a Nikon) I found this problem to be a bit annoying. Also the Coolpix is not happy taking action or sports shots which require quickness from the camera.<br />5. Like any other camera, digital zoom is just marketing nonsense. It almost always makes the picture worse, buy the telephoto lens if you need more zoom. But with an 8X zoom lens (35-280 mm equivalent), you really won't need anything else.<br />Having pointed out all the negatives let me just say now that the camera is excellent. The picture quality is awesome, and if you are really into photography, playing with all the options available in the user modes is great fun. I personally have one mode set up for Black & White pictures, another one for continuous picture taking and the third one for manually adjusting the aperture and shutter speeds.<br />The other digital camera I own is a Minolta Dimage F100. Even though that is a great little camera its biggest fault is the fact that it uses up batteries like there's no tomorrow. With the Nikon that problem is solved by the rechargable EN-EL1 battery, which can operate for about 2 hours continuously and can take about 150 pictures on one charge.<br />I was put off with EVF (Electronic viewfinder) initially, as it cannot compare to an SLR's view. But i've gotten used to it overtime and i find that it actually works quite well. And there's always the option to use the highly adjustable LCD monitor at the back.<br />Ultimately, the best thing about the 5700 is ofcourse the versatility that only a digital camera can provide. You take a picture, look at it, say ah-ah this is not exactly what i wanted, tweak the settings try again, and so on, until you get that perfect picture.<br />In summary, the Coolpix 5700 has all the goodies you'd expect from one of the best camera manufacturers in the world. Don't buy it as a replacement for an SLR because it isn't (though it comes close). It is simply the best prosumer digital camera out there, and in my case it has made me a better photographer than i ever was before. I think that should be praise enough.","I've only had the camera two days, but I'm already enjoying it.  I was a little nonplussed to have buttons on the side that are on the back of my 995, but the focus is better, and it takes closeups (at the farthest focal length without going past what's between the W----T.  I learned with the 995, and this one is the same, that if you go to 1X, 2X or 4X, etc., you'd better have the camera on a tripod.  My 995 doesn't go on a tripod, and it doesn't even have a place to plug in a remote control switch, so I'm glad that this one does.  :)  I'm going to enjoy this camera very much.","My first digital camera.  At first I was a little overwelmed with all the buttons but after a few hours of reading it finally made sense.  Most of that was my denseness.  I am more than happy with quality of pictures.  Still learning but that is all part of the game. Have shot in very low light and pictures come out with great definition and color.  Thank-you Nikon. 1st rate camera.","Yes, this camera has flaws.  It is not perfect.  It has problems with low light.  The buttons on the side can be hard to use, and it can be difficult to find the right one when you do want to use them.<br />But this is still one of the very best digicams on the market, for any amount of money.  Nikon has introduced a new 8700 model, but I am not yet convinced that it's actually better -- higher number of pixels doesn't help, if the quality of the pictures is worse (so far, the jury does not yet seem to have come back with a verdict on that issue).  Nikon also has their D1 and D2 series now (true professional SLRs, with the D2H being the first ever that is truly suitable for professional sports photographers), as well as the D70.<br />But for prosumers, being able to see the picture on the LCD display as you are framing the shot, is very, very important.  It's also important to be able to see the display when you are holding the camera at odd angles.  The Canon 300D (a.k.a., Digital Rebel) is a good entry-level digital SLR, and is the first to allow you to see the picture on the LCD display as it is being framed.  But the display doesn't flip out and twist, unlike almost all the other truly successful prosumer digicams.<br />If/when Nikon can come out with an SLR camera with the kind of resolution of the D70 (and the ability to change lenses, etc... like all SLRs), but with a flip-n-twist LCD display like the 5700/8700, they will permanently take the market back from Canon.  Until then, you have to ask yourself which features you want more than others.","After years of happiness with a Nikon SLR, I decided to go digital at last.  But I had great fear that the camera would be like my home-heating control or an early digital watch, i.e. that you had to carry a fat manual around just to figure out how many times some button had to be pushed to make basic commands.  All I can say is, this camera was superbly designed in a user-interaction sense:  the software/hardware mix is far better that in computers.  It is all common sense!  Thus, this camera is a joy to use and far more economical than my old SLR.<br />The quality of the pictures is also excellent, at 5 megapixels even more detailed than an analogue photo.  I have now experimented with the camera in many conditions and I must say that it focuses quickly and easily - really a joy to use.  And it is much lighter than my old SLR and so easier to carry for long periods.  About the only thing that is a problem is how fast it eats batteries - I would definitely recommend getting the rechargeable battery set.<br />Highest recommendation.  Though more expensive than other models, you are purchasing the Ducati of cameras!  I think it is a design masterpiece.","I received this camera for Christmas and I've had a ball with it.  It does have a serious learning curve to it because it has so many whistles and bells.  I don't understand all of the complaints about low light.  I have taken about 40 and they've turned out great!  My batteries last me a good long time-probably because I can't get used to taking a picture from the view finder.  I tend to use the eye piece.  The only complaint that I have is the speed with which it downloads a picture to the card when using the High or raw mode.  I've found both of these modes-expecially high- take far better pictures but take 30-40 seconds to download it onto the card.  It also takes them at 8\" X 10\" instead of 35\" X 24\" in the fine mode.  (Is there even a printer out there that will print 35\"?)  We did buy a 512 mb card-very necessary on any camera.  It's got a nice comfortable grip to it and weighs very little.  Downloading them onto my computer is a snap!  When I pull them up in Adobe Photoshop, they need little or no tweaking for quality.  The autoflash is easily replaced by a sanp-on flash which would help eliminate any low light problems-if I have any.  The zoom is amazing, although you do lose some quality-as you would with any camera.","My father raved about this camera. So, when he died and left me some money, I bought the camera. Now I wish I hadn't! I had a $200 Kodak digital with nearly no megapixels, and it took awesome pictures, quickly, and even in low light. But, I could not blow them up very big. The Nikon 5700 takes HUGE pictures, but I rarely get good ones, because the focus is so slow that my subject has left the building before the darned camera focuses! It can't focus in low light situations at all, and beware buying kits, because most of the stuff that came in my \"Kit\" doesn't fit the stupid camera! Plan to buy at least four batteries in all (and an extra charger), because you need to have two batteries charging and two batteries with you at all times. This thing doesn't just eat batteries, it chews them up and spits them out! The ttl viewfinder is digital too, so very hard to see what you are actually getting, but the LCD viewfinder drains batteries like kids suck down Mountain Dew! I use the TIFF format so I have good luck with enlargements, but they use so much card space that I had to buy a 1G card to be able to take 60 pictures. The 8 mb card that came with the camera would only take ONE! Nikon makes good products, but this is not one of them! Find a camera with fast focus, or you will wish you had!","Using this camera for the past 7 months. Taken app. 850 photos till date. No issues what so ever and excellent photo quality. But you need to buy an additional battery -- which would have been the case with any camera with chargeable batteries. You can turn off Continuous Autofocus to reduce battery drain. I do use high speed compact flash memory cards such as SanDisk Ultra II 256 MB ( currently the best ) and Lexar Media 256 MB USB 12X with my camera otherwise the wait time between consecutive shots can be very high.<br />Pros :: 5MP, 8X zoom, lightweight<br />Cons :: in-built flash is not sufficient, especially outdoors photography. Using NIKON SB-50DX Autofocus Speedlight with my camera.","Had this camera for the past 7 months. Taken app. 850 photos till date. No issues what so ever and excellent photo quality.

This is a wonderful camera in every sense of the word. I'll give you the good and then the bad.<br />THE GOOD:<br />The lense is by far one of the best on the market as evidenced by the clarity and sharpeness. The zoom is very handy and I was able to close in on far off mountains, eagles, etc. It's a good size for my hands and I'm 6'3\", a big guy to say the least. Whether you are into all the gizmos that SLR's offer or simply want a point and shoot, this is wonderful. You can save settings for various situations. For example, I have one setting for dark indoor places, another for cloudy days, and another for macro shots. My wife hates gadgets and I taught her how to simply switch it to automatic and she loves it too! The camera doesn't feel cheap, but rather, amazingly sturdy.<br />The 5 megapixels come in handy since I am shooting to find the best to use as original art in my home. My sister-in-law is so impressed that I'm now her photographer instead of the costly studios when shooting her newborn. Hey, I'm not a professional either and the camera made me look like an expert!<br />THE BAD:<br />Yeah, the clicking and whirring is annoying but if you know how to read and comprehend decently, you'll understand ways to focus differently in certain situations. Those that complain are either impatient or might be lacking in the comprehension department.<br />Attachments are a great plus such as the 2x close up lens or whatever. Hoever, they will take about 10 - 20 seconds to get out and set up for various shots which is annoyance. Having said that, isn't it about the same for a true SLR camera too?<br />I wish the filters would go directly over the lense but instead, it goes over the attachment meaning that you will not get full range of your 8x lense because the attachment doesn't allow for full extension. Sometimes, I get the dreaded barrel look so I think I'll look into a wider lense to make up for the barrel.<br />Batteries go fast! However, I have one backup and a quick recharger that can be charged in the cigarette lighter of my car. Keep 'em charged and you are fine. With both batteries, I can fill up 526MB card without problems as long as my saving mode is relatively short.<br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Great prosumer camera. After researching and testing many, this is the best quality if you are into quality of photos with the most toys as long as you are willing to take time to LEARN how to use it! This camera should last me another 6 years or so.","I have read some of the sour grapes reviews, And Frankly I dont<br />understand. I Own this fine camera and as for the focusing in low light situations..........You have to play with the shutter button half way depressed and it works fine....<br />And as for the photo\"s they are Stellar................<br />Buy this Camera, spend some time reading the Manual........You have to do that, You are not buying a average run of the mill mickey mouse digital camera.........Once you do that and familurize yourself with this fine machine.......You will feel totally Rewarded, I know I have..........","I will try and keep this one fairly short.  I've had this camera for about six months now and absolutely love it.  I have a pro SLR so I do not use this camera with the intent of taking prize winning photos, although in some cases it could.<br />This is a very handy little camera.  Nothing matches it in its price range and class, if you want more than this camera offers you will need to upgrade to a digital SLR.  The adjustable screen is incredibly useful, I didnt think I'd use it much but now find myself keeping this camera instead of upgrading to the SLR specifically so I can keep the adjustable screen.<br />Warnings for new users out there:<br />1. Following the lead of the rest of the Nikon family, this camera has a very slow autofocus.  On top of that, it is HORRIBLE to focus in low light.  Fortunately, most users of this type of camera are not taking night time candid or action photos, if you need to you will have to buy a SLR to get the performance you will need.  This camera is excellent for daylight and \"around the house\" photography.<br />2. Make sure you buy a fast memory card.  If you buy a standard Compact Flash card you will be waiting up to a minute between photos while it saves if you use the higher resolution.  The card that comes with the camera only holds about 5 photos, so plan on buying a card with the camera.<br />3. The aftermarket lenses are horrible, do not buy unless you have tried them ahead of time and know what you are going to get for your money.<br />4. Digital editing software that comes with the camera is not good for much, I'd recoment getting a better software package.","The Nikon digital cameras I've tested over the last year have not fared so well against comparibly priced models by Sony and Olympus, but the 5700 is a huge step in the right direction.  The optics are a significant improvement over other Coolpix models tested and in particular, the problems at wide angle have been reduced.  The 8x optical zoom and fast continuous shooting mode make this one of the better consumer 5 MB action cameras on thre market today.  And, as usual, flash performance is a step ahead of the competition.  At 1,200 bucks, this super performance doesn't come cheap, but if your needs match the 5700's fortes, you'll love it.  Solid class A.","We have an infant- 13 mos. He is quick- this camera takes shots fast and great. It has a lot of functions that make \"shooting\" nice. I would reccommend this to a beginner and someone more advanced SLR skills. My hubby and are very pleased.","This is a very sophisticated camera that appeals to the affluent casual user & the pro-sumer - hence the spectrum of ratings ( its really too sophisticated for the casual user - & has annoyances for the semi-pro user ). This camera is a VERY sophisticated - feature rich camera. Most of the problems noted in the reviews have excellent work arounds ( IE like any other camera ) IE shutter priority, aperature priority, bracketing. What probably frustrates users is that because it is heavily \"automatic\" - it doesnt solve all picture taking problems \"at the press of a button\" - you have to use alternative modes in low light conditions, a tri-pod etc - these workarounds are usually buried in menus etc. I have found the battery life excellent \"IF YOU DONT USE THE FLASH MUCH\". I carry two batteries - I buy the MAHA batteries - they are cheaper & have 20% more capacity & their charge time is just as fast - work with the NIKON OEM charger - forget the OEM NIKON batteries. The Nikon software is excellent & much improved. This camera ( for what I do ) - there is nothing else out there the is like it in a compact package - the ergonomics as simply excellent - & the flip out view finder is essential for what I do. The resolution capabilities, & zoom are fabulous. The small camera bag that can be bought as an accessory from NIKON with the belt loop - SUCKS - this has disintegrated on me & has also almost let my camera depart my body for the pavement !! If you buy this camera - use you VISA - VISA adds another year or two to your factory warranty & forget the consumer add-on warranties ! Im also using a 1Gig IBM microdrive - which has very fast write-times - remember this when you are looking at solid state memory ! Therefore, the recovery time between shots is reasonable. NITS - camera does not recover between shots very quickly - very annoying - have missed some shots - but this is true of all current digital camera in this price range. The power save mode puts the camera asleep when not in use, also causing you to miss candid shots if you are not mindful - I usually pulse the trigeer occasionally to \"keep it awake\" - this can be adjusted though - which I havent bothered to do .. The competition in this price range - SONY/Minotla 7? - SOny uses over priced proprietary media ( memory sticks) has slightly better resolution & horrible ergonomics ( overall for me not worth it - plus Ive never have a Sony product that has lasted very long - they look great - but my experiance is that they are fragile.) The Minolta in this price range is not as good & eats batteries- but is cheaper - IN THIS PRICE RANGE ONLY TWO CAMERAS - The S0ny & The NIKON period as of 10/2003.. But check the price of the Sony media ...The IBM microdrives can be had for very cheap right now since they have sold out to Fugitsu on the uDrive technology & patents ( Fugitsu now offeres a 4 gig microdrive based on the IBM technology - & again the advantage is writetimes - check this out !! ) If you are going to buy solid state memory - get the VIKING on AMAZON w/rebate, you won't find a cheaper price, yes - even on ebay !","This is a very good quality camera in most respects. The optical quality is superb, the zoom is excellent, and the function is fairly intuitive. It is compact and cleanly designed. I have problems in three areas however. As others have noted, the autofocus is annoyingly slow. Also, you cannot raise the flash manually when you know you will need it. Instead, you must depress the shutter button, which results in an unintended flash photo occuring half the time. Lastly, the close focus limit is rather distant making macro photos impossible. Since it too big to fit in a pocket or purse I am looking forward to a suitable carrying case being available. Overall, it is an excellent value.","All I've got to say is that this camera is great! I have owned this camera for 9 months now and have not been disappointed. Colors are accurate and images are precise. If you're looking for a point and shoot camera, this camera works, but once you discover the results, you realize this is a serious camera. The 8X optical zoom lets you get in close for professional results, without intruding. It's a camera you can get into to explore your imagination and photography to it's fullest.<br />Pros: 5MP, 8Xoptical zoom, point and shot, aperture priority, shutter priority. Plus you can add on lens, filters, and external flash.<br />Cons: Buy an extra battery or 2, batteries last 90 minutes of continuous use. Using file formats of RAW, or TIF, you'll either need a bigger hard drive or CD burner to save images.<br />As with most digital cameras, image size & quality dictates the camera's response time.","This is an excellent digital camera.  For the past several years I have had a Nikon Coolpix 950.  While it did a good job, I have used Nikon 35 mm cameras for decades and the unusual shape of the Coolpix 950 never felt as comfortable to hold and use as a 35 mm. Also, the 950 was too menu driven to make it quick and easy to use.<br />Problems solved with the Coolpix 5700!  Although it is smaller than any 35 mm I've ever owned, it still has the familiar shape.  It is also less menu driven, with several buttons that allow you to easily access features so that you can keep your eye on your subject, rather than having to flip through lengthy menus.  While there is an extensive menu system, Nikon has provided 4 different user settings, 3 of which you can customize with whatever features you want so that you do not have to constantly be searching through menus to set the camera up for different situations.  I have one user setting set up for ease of aperture priority use, another set up for shutter priority use, the third set up for complete manual use. Switching from one user setting to another is easy and can be done while keeping your eye on your subject.<br />I admit that the camera could have actually benefited from being slightly larger, but overall it has a good solid feel and easy to use layout. (People with very large hands might disagree).<br />Only criticisms:  (1)  The lens is not threaded for filters!!  There is a substantial piece of glass in front of this camera and the only way to protect it is to buy some goofy extension tubes and put a filter on that.  This is very poor designing for a camera that is intended for advanced amateurs and \"prosumers.\" (2)  The auto focus is a little slow.  Overall, the lag time for this camera is significantly better than my 950, as well as most other digitals, but the auto focus can sometimes be a little slow and finicky with certain subjects.  (3)  The LCD monitor on the back is a little too small. Again, the camera would have benefited from a little larger overall size, which would include a little larger monitor on the back.  The monitor on my old 950 is substantially larger.  (4)  Nikon needs to package this camera with at least a 64 MB CF card (or better yet a 128), instead of the almost useless 32 MB card that it currently comes with.  (I heard that earlier production models came with only a 16MB card!!).<br />All of that having been said, this is a GREAT camera.  I haven't experienced any of the problems with the pop-up flash that others have reported.  Perhaps this was an issue with some of the earlier production models.  Included in the box is a battery charger, which was an excellent idea on Nikon's part.  (There is nothing worse than buying a new toy and you can't even play with it because you can't charge the batteries).  5 MP is awesome, the picture color and balance is superb, and the extensive list of features and flexibility is astounding.  If you're looking for a top of the line digital for under a grand, this is the one!","This camera is great, some people complain about being too complicated, but I want to tell you what this camera is.<br />This camera is the top of the line for Nikon prosumer cameras, so shows advanced features other cameras of its kind does not have.  It is the last step before buying a professional digital camera, being professional an 'interchangeable lens SLR digital camera'.<br />To fully understand this camera you should have owned 2 cameras before.  1) A 35mm SLR  2) An entry level digital camera<br />if you have that background you'll find the 5700 just great, but if you don't, then you'll be stuck wondering what is an f stop or why you cannot (actually should not) send raw images by e-mail to your friends.<br />Because its lenses cannot be interchanged they must be treated carefully.  One of my next adquisitions will be the Nikon 5597 67MM FILTER ADAPTER RING, a 67mm UV filter and a 67mm lens cap.<br />I would also recommend getting the 'Nikon Camera Case for Nikon Coolpix 5700 Digital Camera'","I recently purchased this camera.  It is incredible, more than I was hoping for in my first \"nice\" digital camera.  You MUST read the manual in order to be able to understand and use all of the features.  Once you figure it out, this is a very versitle camera.  I wont bother to list them in my review, read the Editorial Review for the details.<br />Two cautions:<br />First, dont expect the super fast focus you might be used to in a 35mm SLR, this camera does take its time when focusing, especially when it is not in bright light.<br />Second, the compact flash that comes with the camera is not useful for anything.  It will not hold more than 1-3 pictures when on the higher settings.  It will hold about 10 picutures on the lower settings. If you buy this camera, but a 256 or 512 Compact Flash card along with it or you will be disapointed.<br />This is a great camera as long as you arent trying for fast action shots requiring a quick focus time.  I use this camera for 90% of the around the house photography of the kids and such.  I also have a 35mm SLR that I use for the action shots though.","I've had the camera for about 10 days.  It's the second digital camera for me -- so I have something to compare it against.  The first one was a FujiPhoto with very similiar features, but 2.3 Mpixels.  If you haven't owned a digital camera I can see where you might think the Nikon is difficult to use.  After having explored and used all the features, I give the Nikon an \"A\" for ease of use.  The advantage is that the features most often needed are available through readily available buttons, thumbwheels, or a combination of the two as opposed to deeply nested screen menus.  If all you want to do is shoot vacation photos, you shouldn't spend $$$$ for a camera.  On the other hand, to take advantage of the camera you must spend a few hours with the manual and machine.  The Nikon will reward you.<br />The quality is noticeably better -- for at least two reasons.  One, the Nikon has 5 Mpixels and then the Nikon glass is reputed to be very good.  The lens seems to make for about 2/3 the size and weight of the camera.  I'm not sure you would notice the difference between 3x5 photos taken at the company picnic, but get into the fine or high size and use the macro lens for closeup photos of flowers and the detail stands out.<br />On the critical side I have a few comments.  Someone else has mentioned the size of the review screen and I agree its a bit small -- smaller than the Fuji even.  But then again it does swivel and the camera has a good viewfinder to boot.  I've adapted to the size without problem.  One annoyance I've found is having to reset the timer after each shot when shooting on the tripod.  I don't do that very often -- and who knows, maybe there's a way to set it that I haven't discovered yet.  This probably applies to most digital cameras, but for me some of the options are unneccessary (e.g., sharpness, contrast, etc.).  I think the filters are better applied through photo software on the computer.  I do like the noise reduction feature, though, for long exposures.  It seems to do a better job erasing those little white spots than the computer.<br />I like the camera and will enjoy using it.  You'll need a case for all the pieces, a CompactFlash with at least 256Mb, and an extra battery.  I also recommend a CompactFlash reader so you don't have to hook the camera to the computer and an SB-30 Nikon Speedlight flash. This small, additional flash will more than double your effective range since the camera will also use the internal one simultaneously if needed.","I'm very impressed with this camera.  Yes, the autofocus can take some time--luckily I'm not shooting any type of action.  And it can hunt for quite a while in low light, but use of a tripod almost always fixes the problem.<br />The lens is amazing.  I've done a lot of still life work with the camera--just zooming in all the way from about 2 to 3 feet away, not even setting the camera in \"macro\" mode--and the quality of the resulting photographs is completely amazing.  The Nikon 5700 is pricey, but it's because of the lens.  The lens makes the camera worth the extra $$$.<br />I did have one problem with the camera, which was it started dramatically over- or under-exposing after exposing 2 or 3 images.  I was about to put it int he box and ship it back to Nikon for repair, when I decided to reset all the settings back to the factory defaults--which fixed the problem.  Some reviewers have noted how the buttons onthe left side of the lens barrel are easy at accidentally press while shooting.  Apparently that's what I did.<br />The camera is very small and light, and I agree with many reviewers who say that it is too small/light.  I purchased the optional battery pack.  Not only does it let you use standard AA rechargables, it adds enough bulk to the camera to make shooting seem more \"normal\" for someone raised on Nikon SLRs.  It also adds a second shutter release and zoom control for shooting in Portrait mode--doesn't sound liek a big deal until you use it, then you realize how completely cool it is, especially if you shoot as many portraits as me.<br />Most of my photography is black-and-white.  Not only does the Nikon 5700 let you take pictures directly in black-and-white, but because it uses a digital viewfinder, the can visualize your photographs in bakc-and-white before you take them!  This is a very cool feature.<br />Another feature I've found useful for portrait photography is the video cable that comes with the camera.  Plug on end into the camera and the other end into your TV, and you can use your TV as a giant viewfinder to compose your photographs!<br />Overall, the Nikon 5700 is a tremendous camera.  It's not a camera for everyone, but I am extremely happy with my purchase.","I have always used Nikon 35mm SLR Cameras for my photography hobby and decided to go for a digital and bought coolpix 5700.<br />The camera takes great pictures, but too slow in focusing. it's got lot of features but takes too many buttons to set. while you are trying set up your camera you'll miss your shots.  I been taking it mostly in manual mode because, I have hard time getting the correct exposure from program mode, so I use manual, shutter/apature priority.<br />My recommandation is if you are taking moving objects, the camera is way too slow (typical digital camera is slow but I find that it's slower than avg), but if you are taking non moving object such as landscape, it takes excellent pictures.  my biggest frustration of using this camera is that it's way toooooooo slow. If I get the correct setting for picture in time, the picture quality is excellent, but main problems is setting the camera up correctly ( or I could in my learning curve).","Excellent photo quality. Have to read the manual a couple of time to setup camera extra options. Otherwise the default option is more than sufficient.","I upgraded to the Coolpix 5700 last Christmas. My only previous digital experience was derived from using the still frame feature on my camcorder, which was completely automatic. The Coolpix was easy to use, right out of the box. It took me about a half hour to learn the basic controls of the Coolpix, and another half hour to learn the complex functions of it, contrary to the horror stories I've heard of people having a difficult time with learning how to use this camera.<br />  The Coolpix is versatile and powerful. Its 8x optical zoom is incredible, especially for birding and sports, and beats almost every 5-megapixel camera out there. While its digital zoom is a temptation, however, it really isn't necessary and almost certainly will degrade the picture quality. At night, I've shot star trails by activating noise reduction and using a tripod and cable shutter release accessory for the Coolpix camera line. I've even used a special adapter and connected the camera to my telescope, and have obtained wonderful pictures of the moon, nebulae, and the planets. This is made possible because the 5700 has very low noise at its ISO 100 and 200 settings. At my school, I've taken pictures for the yearbook, and when I submitted the prints I made, the moderator asked me about the film I used. The quality of the results clearly matches that of film cameras, as the yearbook moderator didn't even realize I had used digital.<br />  I do however have several gripes. Those who have used SLR cameras will dislike the shutter lag in the camera. Once you press the shutter release button, the camera hesitates before taking the picture. This is a drawback for sports. Also, battery life is short, about 40 minutes to a charge. Furthermore, autofocus can be inaccurate indoors sometimes. This may just be a result of the lighting scheme of my house, but since the camera has no autofocus assist light, focussing is sometimes difficult in poor lighting. Additionally, the noise level in the ISO 400 is moderately high and, at ISO 800, images I've taken are unacceptable for most purposes.<br />  I would not allow these issues, however, to draw you away from the camera. Some won't even be issues for a lot of people. I'd give the camera 4 and a half stars, rounding up to five, because many of the aforementioned minor problems I've had are common in digital cameras and some I've noticed because just I use the 5700 in ways I doubt Nikon even conceived (using it for astrophotography, for instance) In 6 months, I've taken nearly 3,000 pictures with the 5700, and have been beyond satisfied with its overall performance. It can satiate many desires in a camera. The picture quality is absolutely impeccible. If you do purchase this camera, however, do buy at least a 256MB memory card - Nikon only supplies you with a 16MB card, enough to hold 6 pictures at a low compression ratio and full image size. The Coolpix has served me well, and has my highest recommendation.","I never figured out how to use this camera. I gave it to my brother-in-law who was an IT manager for the Balkan states for KBR. He really liked it and had no problems with it.","I am strictly an amateur, but wanted to make the switch from 35mm to digital. Tight budget.  Friends let me borrow their Kodak EasyShare (3.0meg) and a 4 meg Olympus, and they were \"OK.\"  I was not going to spend the extra $$$ on the 5700.  Then I read all the reviews of the Coolpix 5700 on Amazon and also the article on it in Consumer Reports/Online.  Consumer Reports gave it a top rating, and everyone else raved about it. I thought it was too good to be true.  Believe what you read.  I am an amateur, but in about 15 minutes after taking it out of the box, I was making great pictures; even up to full-size enlargments.  Warning: everyone else is right about the low-light problem. The camera is just not sure what to do in very low light.  That's why I gave it only 4 stars.  However, when you have 5 megapixels you are in digital heaven.  Clarity, color, flexibility, color copies, people tell me that I am making stuff like a professional.  A 256 flashcard is all I need.  You can choose your photo quality, and even change quality settings between pictures. The adjustable LCD is versatile and helps a lot. I usually use the 3mg setting.  I shoot all day, store it, and start all over again.  I used the 5meg. setting on some wildflowers, and made a 14X20 enlargement.  Crystal clear, you can practically see the pollen.  Save your pennies and go for this one.  PS:  I also got the wideangle lens, but the 5700 is so versatile, you can easily live without it.","I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. The camera is very responsive and it's perfect for spontaneous snapshots. It focuses extremely well and the only drawback was trying to stuff all the camera's complexities into my unmechanical brain.","I bought this camera about 6 months ago, And I must say that aside from a few minor draw backs, This camera will fullfil all the expectations that you have for a digital camera, However this camera is not for the average user, You must read the manual<br />and once thats done read it again, and keep it within arms reach for reference  untill you get use to all the wonderful features of this semi pro camera.","Whilst the quality of this camera is excellent in daylight, the damn flash did not work - brand new too! Still waiting for it to be resolved.<br />I have heard other customers complaining about this too, so be warned.<br />The autofocus is a bit annoying as it hunts around, whirring and clicking.<br />The actual photo's (not been able to try the flash) are excellent, and the features are awesome.<br />It takes a bit of searching and hunting to navigate through the complex menu structure, and the battery life is too low especially when you are first using it to try and understand what it can do.<br />Maybe worth getting a mains adaptor.<br />The memory card supplied is a bit stingy, and should be at least 128 instead of 32, and the standard package didn't even come with a carry case.<br />I am quite new to photography in general, so my knowledge of all of the sttings is quite limited, however, when the flash is fixed and I have bought a couple more batteries, I may be able to give it a better review.<br />I am not impressed that Nikon can ship defective units especially when you are paying around 1000US","Although I am pretty familiar with Nikon's digital controls having owned a Coolpix 880, I recommend spending some time with the instruction manual:  Not because I think the camera is that complicated, but so that you can fully appreciate what the 5700 can do!  This is an excellent camera if you really want a digital SLR but can't justify the cost; the 5700's electronic viewfinder behaves like a true SLR while the 8x optical zoom (not digital, which is nearly worthless) covers most lens focal lengths.<br />I love my film cameras (also Nikon), but there are many advantages to owning a digital camera.  Not only can you see your results right away, but the digital nature has some cool advantages - want to shoot in B&W?  Don't change film, just change a camera setting.  The viewfinder in the 5700 will also show in B&W!  That's pretty cool.  At a decent resolution with moderate compression, I can get 1,100 images on a ... 256 MB card.  Yes, that's one thousand one hundred - at a quality that will produce a very decent 8x10 print.  How many rolls of film is that?<br />Of course the Nikon quality is exceptional, from the ED glass in the optics to the very strong alloy body.  I do not feel that the size is too small, but I do find the positioning of the right camera strap a wee bit awkward.<br />If you do consider digital, with the 5700 or not, I do recommend buying extra memory cards - the prices are low and the 16 to 32 MB cards that usually come with the camera will fill too quickly, especially if you want to use the full 5 MP resolution.  Also, battery life is a problem.  Buying those ... lithium batteries for the 880 (same battery as the 5700) nearly bankrupted me until I bought Nikon's rechargable battery system (which the 5700 comes with - kudos to Nikon).  Buy an extra battery or two - you will not regret it!  Indeed, shell out the bucks for the 5700, you won't regret that either.","This has to be the best camara out there. Everything you will ever need to take excellent pictures.","Read the Manual...read the manual...The Manual! I know many don't like to sit down and spend quality time with a manual but with this camera it's worth the effort. Way too many options and not always clear as to what will work and what won't. For example someone mentioned setting the auto-focus to manual. Yes but it isn't possible in auto or A mode..only in User 1,2,or 3 mode. So here the person's advice left out an important detail. Batteries are available quite reasonably if you are willing to shop for them. I've been paying 18 before shipping and will get two more to make it a total of 5 which includes the one with the camera.<br />Pictures are what count! Resolution is so far great. We live where there are Mountains in N.W. Montana almost Canada and if you manual focus you get better resolution than on auto. But either blows the lower digitals away.<br />Take time to make some cheater cards the size of business cards that show your selection modes and settings for User 1,2,&3. (We assign or think of User as not user perse but for usage. Macro's verses scenery manual focusing for scenery over the auto mode etc.) If you need to change one you then have the info handy to reset it later. Also some quick reference cards help remind you of things you might need to do at a later date. We laminate them up and update them when we find our preferences have changed. Manual is often to bulky to carry in our packs or in smaller belt camera cases. Only had this camera since Wed...under a week. I got it for myself to use professionally in macro seed work and scenery both. Can't get it out of the grips of my husbands hands. He has it around his neck constantly. I think he's sleeping with the camera too. I know he'd taken naps with the manual tightly gripped in his hands. I've warned him he's got only a week to decide that it's not his or I will too have to order another. I did get a great deal on this one..under eight hundred with rebate and it came 2 days after ordering. Not every dealer stocks it. A lot of dealers esp. NY area want to bate you and then put it on continuous back order. I got off that routine and was amazed how much I got a USA warranty package. Good luck..it is a very interesting camera.<br />Update the memory to 256 right away. Amazon.com has had great prices on 256 size Compact Flash memory from various vendors. Save around half of buying just one mega sized card by going for four 256 cards. (Saves battery life too.) Also more flexable system to assign various cards for specialized work. Macro seeds/ flowers field / Mountains / Wildlife or general. One can be downloaded and have a spare card to go! If you put in the effort with this camera it'll perform!","My first real film camera was a Pentax Spotmatic 35mm SLR. My current film camera is still a Pentax Spotmatic. To those whom it matters, that should say it all.<br />In the store, I compared the Coolpix 5700 with the Minolta Dimage 7i. The Minolta starts up faster, due to the manual zoom optical system. However, the musical tone it makes is very unprofessional and calls attention to itself. The Nikon does a mechanical initialize and then with a slight tone is ready; more like a pro's camera. The Minolta has larger displays (viewfinder and LCD) that make changing settings easier. (I wish the Nikon's displays were that size!) However, the Coolpix's LCD viewer (normally placed against the back of the camera to protect it from scratches) can be rotated to most any angle required, including downward to facilitate holding the camera overhead and still being able to compose shots. Try that on your 35mm film camera!<br />For manual focussing, the Minolta has a manual focus ring, but it requires a lot of turns to go from infinite to macro (very slow if you are used to the focus ring of a 35mm SLR camera) and the display is pixelated in some way that makes it difficult to determine when an area is in focus. The Coolpix 5700 requires pressing buttons, but gets there quicker and the focus is more like the ground glass of a 35mm SLR camera.<br />In the automatic mode, the Coolpix 5700 is hyperactive, always busy checking and adjusting focus. I found that annoying. I guess it reduces battery life, too. So, I set the user modes to check focus only when the shutter button is halfway down. Once the camera has set the focus, a picture can be taken as fast as a film camera. In very low light, the camera may have a problem finding the focus point. In this case, you can either manually focus the camera, or use a pocket flashlight to momentary shine on the object - the camera will lock in instantly.<br />In the studio, the Coolpix 5700 works as good as any 35mm SLR for portraits. By swinging the LCD display outward, a portrait can be composed easier than it would be peering into the viewfinder of a 35mm SLR camera. The results are equivalent to 100 ASA 35mm Kodak Ektachrome film, with the advantage of being able to get a print within minutes. I have an HP Deskjet 932 and use HP Premium Plus glossy paper. I get a print that is as good in quality as a regular glossy print from film, except that the dot pattern from the ink jets is visible on close inspection - instead of the normal soft grain of photographic film.<br />In the field, the LCD and viewfinder displays stand up to all but direct sunlight. I wear glasses, so light does stray into the viewfinder - however, I get that with all cameras. I have developed the technique of shading the top of the camera with my hand and this technique works fine with the Coolpix 5700. I find that the camera snuggles nicely in my hands. Some reviewers report encountering a problem with the right eyelet - I wonder if they are holding the camera correctly? The correct way is shown in the manual, similar to the way you would properly hold a 35mm SLR camera. Also, the editorial reviewer states the camera may be a bit too small considering its functionality. That's an interesting comment. I find that in the field, smaller is better as long as the camera is rugged (which the Coolpix 5700 appears to be). A small camera is less obtrusive and less of a burden when wandering around all day long in a crowded air show.<br />There are so many functions built into this camera that there is almost nothing you cannot do with it. Hoever, the big disadvantage of this camera is having to negotiate the complex menu structure to find all these functions. I have problems with it at times and I am very experienced with computers at that! That slows down making certain changes, sometimes requiring a check of the manual to locate a certain setting. With some planning and programming the user modes, you can limit this problem when shooting in the field by setting each mode for a certain type of situation that might be encountered.<br />The final word: Pentax Spotmatic 35mm film cameras have been my friends for many years. They are now relegated to the closet, replaced by the Nikon Coolpix 5700.","I use it almost every day.  I make images of the building that I'm building, beautiful macros, my dog, everything.  Reading the manual is key, and even better (the best) is going to the Nikon School when it's in your area.  I learned so much from that!  With the automatic settings, it takes great shots, and when you learn to customize your settings, you can get fantastic images.  I have an N6006, and an F3, and I think I'm going to sell them, I only use this camera.  The only drawback in my mind is that it isn't true TTL, and the \"larger\" lcd display is dinky considering the price of the camera.  But the compromise is OK.  I've done everything from macro work to scenics.  And with a good tripod, I've even merged shots into panoramics.  I lovelovelove this little camera!","As many people have noted elsewhere, this is a camera for people who  know about photography. The range of choices in the 5700 for exposure, contrast, focus and all the other things that affect the quality of a photograph, make it an excellent choice for the advanced amateur. None of the other prosumer digital cameras can match the 5700 in features.<br />But I found it was also a great choice for a wanna-be prosumer like me, since the large number of choices allows one to learn about photography by firing away a hundred photos at different settings, then seeing how the choices affect the results (the EXIF data, which tells what exposure, contrast, shutter speed and a whole bunch of other settings were used in taking a particular photograph, are saved with each picture).  Unlike similar strategies in the film camera world, this costs almost nothing, since the cost of taking a photo with a digital camera is about zero.  Point and shoot is easy, but you don't learn anything when that is all you do.<br />The weakest feature is low light focus (more accurately,low contrast focus).  Weakest, that is, if the photographer does not know how to use some easy techniques to help solve it.  Its not as bad as some would claim.<br />Especially strong features to me are the general quality of the photos, the excellent macro (closeup) shot capability, the 8X telephoto capability, the relatively compact size, the continuous shot feature, which takes rapid multiple shots for as long as you keep the button pressed, the \"best shot selector\", which selects the sharpest photo out of many under adverse shooting situations and saves only that photo to the card (this is a feature found in no other camera) and auto \"bracketing\", which allows successive shots at different exposures when you don't know which exposure setting might be the best.<br />I've had the camera for about 6 months now and taken thousands of pictures.  Learned something about photography from almost every one...","This is my first digital camera, having used multiple Nikon film cameras over 40 years. The camera has four limitations: 1) in indoor lighting, autofocus \"hunts\" and \"hunts\"; 2) steep learning curve with a BIG manual REQUIRED reading; 3) no filters possible? VERY Strange; 4) proprietary battery, whose life with autofocus and fill-in speedlight available runs 30-40 minutes.<br />Output quality even at normal setting is superb. With enough time and effort I'm confident I'll master the WEALTH of possibilities, but it is a complicated camera if one wishes to master the variety of options. Easy to use at auto-everything setting. Lots more control possible with various User Settings 1, 2, or 3. I'd recommend one or more 512 high-speed Compact Flash cards as a minimum, unless you stay mighty close to your computer, and I'd get at least three additional Nikon batteries. With time and effort, I've grown to love it, but it's not easy for a digital \"newbie.\" Expect to spend a LOT of time in a complicated menu system and a LOT of time with your nose in the rather poorly written manual.<br />For a MUCH better manual, buy Dennis P. Curtin's \"Short Course in  Nikon CoolPix 5700 Photography.\" The printed format is B&W, but the included CD allows one to print the whole manual in color [.pdf file] and/or a 14-page \"cheat sheet\" that greatly simplifies the confusing controls on this VERY capable camera.<br />LATER: After 13 months with this camera, I continue to find GREAT picture quality, but will trade it for an 8700 in order to get a decent autofocus. We tried taking baby pictures in indoor lighting and it was simply hopeless. The AF essentially \"gives up\" in low lighting ... a stupid design flaw, as is the lack of easy use of filters and a complex set buttons, wheels, switches, etc. In decent lighting this is an EXTREMELY capable camera, with gorgeous output. For very little more the 8700 is far more capable of working in a low-light environment.","First off let me say that the camera is amazing.  The pictures are better than any digital pictures I have seen before.  I would have given this camera six stars if Nikon had done two things differently:<br />1.  Put a bigger flash card with it.  They include a 16MB card with it.  That is a joke for a camera like this; they should have included at least a 64MB card.  I would recommend at least a 256MB card.  In RAW format your pictures are over 14MB!  I know not many people are going to take a 14MB picture; I like to use the fine setting, which averages out to about 1.5MB apiece.<br />2.  The batteries stink.  They last about 90 mins which isn't that bad, what is so annoying is that they are not standard batteries.  Replacement batteries retail for about 50.  (Although Amazon sells them for much less.)  I want AA!!!  (They make an add-on that allows you to use AA but that will set you back a pretty penny too.)<br />For as much money as this camera cost I would expect it to be a little more consumer friendly.<br />All in all it is a great camera and I would recommend purchasing to everyone.  Just keep in mind you will need to buy a larger flash card and at least one more battery.","I have owned this camera for 6 months and find its picture quality superb. The ability to preprogram for certain functions such as cloudy lighting, movie mode, and a third incandescent light ( you can program many other features easily yourself) all easily accessible through the turn of a dial, are wonderful to have. Accessing the macro function is also readily accessible. I mad 700 pictures in the Galapagos islands, and having 5 mega pixels to crop and enlarge to make great 8X10 pictures that are really wonderful. The movie function with sound is much better than my Nikon 880. the 8X zoom functioned well. Comparing my photos with those of my fellow travelers, I think the colors are more saturated and clearer.<br />Reading the instruction manual is important to use all the features of this camera. Battery life is shorter than I would like. Focusing when there is not much light and at times for close-ups is slow. Since I had read about this from others, I was prepared and accepted it. I have not tried manual focusing yet. Taking pictures of fast moving objects is possible, but difficult, as with most non-professional digital cameras. I enthusiastically recommend this camera.","This camera is awesome.  While contemplating either going up to a digital SLR or not, I discovered the 5700.  After holding the unit in my hands, I fell in love with it.  The functions are amazing, not missing many functions of SLR digitals.  However, because of the point-and-click ability, the camera functions and its small size, it functions as my everyday camera as well as my portrait camera during my professional jobs.  Although it lacks the \"professional\" look of a big, bulky SLR camera, my results are arguably equivalent to those made with my film-based SLR.  I would highly, highly recommend this camera.<br />  My only complaint is the lengthy time that it takes to write to the disk.  I understand that it is not extremely lengthy for digitals, but I see that as the main drawback in my experience of digitals against analog, film-based photography.  However, my write speed has significantly been increased by use of Viking cards rather than SanDisk (very slow media) cards.","This little camera was one of the best investments I made for my business (I publish a small newspaper in rural WA). I wanted something I could carry in my purse, since I like to have a camera with me at all times. It's lightweight, easy to handle (I have been able to take pictures while hanging onto my notebook, a pen, and a plate of food) and isn't so obtrusive that people think \"oh, so the press is here\" the moment I walk in the room. The high res is great--nobody believes me when I tell them we use a digital camera, and we enlarge a lot of shots.<br />The 8x zoom allows me to be part of the crowd--I can hang back and don't have to get in someone's face to get decent shots. I've also found it useful for wildlife photography for the same reason.<br />Complaints? Yeah, the card is too small, you'll need another battery, and you'll probably need to read the manual, and refer to it often, especially if you use a bigger speedlight or wide angle lens.<br />Another reviewer says the small LCD display is too small--but I use mine all the time. The compactness of the unit probably dictated that the screen be on the small side--a worthwhile sacrifice, in my opinion. Being able to see what shots I've got has saved me a lot of time, and you can also use the screen as a viewfinder if you can't have the camera right next to your face.<br />For my needs, it's been a perfect match and I've been quite impressed with it.","Takes excellent pictures usually. If the picture is not perfect, it is usually a focus problem. The swing out LCD is too small, low res and nearly worthless. The electronic viewfinder could be better. If you want to use the manaul focus its hard to tell when you have it focused accurately because the viewfinder isnt very sharp and there are no measurements (feet or meters) of distance, just a sliding bar. Zoom lens is great. Macro mode (close ups)  is outstanding. No low light flash assist. You will need an extra battery and a bigger memory card so put that in your budget if you go for this expensive baby!<br />If you can live without the 8x zoom lens, there are probably better choices where you can get more camera for less money. Otherwise just bite the bullet and try not to whine too much like I do.","Here is a short summary of my experience with the camera the last few days.  For starters, this camera has an enormous feature set.  For a relative beginner like myself I had to read the entire manual - carefully.  You can take it out of the box using the default settings and take fantastic pictures however I ran into a number of issues until I started reading.<br />The camera battery charges in about 2 hours - which is great.  The battery was only lasting about 70 minutes at first but after asking someone why it was \"clicking\" all the time I found out it has a default setting of continuous auto-focus.  This keeps the image in the viewfinder sharp but is much harder on the battery.  I changed the setting to focus only when I press the shutter release halfway down and now get about 90 minutes battery life.<br />I initially had a problem with the auto focus not locking on in low light.  After changing a couple settings it is much better.  Tonight I finally tried out the picture previews.  Looking through the viewfinder, I found a photo I took where I wasn't sure if the subject had closed their eye's or not.  They were standing a short distance away and on the small LCD I couldn't tell.  Once the picture was selected, I used the zoom feature and went in for a close up.  I could see, plain as day that it was a keeper.  Some people might not consider this a big deal however at a family reunion or similar special occasion you want to know if you need to get another while there's still a chance.  I will also point out that while I scrolled through the images and zoomed in (still in preview mode) they were very responsive.  I expected some lag while panning around but it was trivial.<br />The Electronic View Finder seems kind of strange to me however I'm rapidly growing accustomed to it.  I've heard you can have trouble getting \"action\" shots with it due to the lag behind real life and it updating.  The delay seems to be about 1/20th of a second.  Since you can lock the focus for a distance you expect something to happen and select a program to compensate for your choice of a faster shutter speed, I haven't had a problem with sports.  I actually find it easier than an SLR.  I've never been able to manually rotate that stupid focus ring in time to catch anything.  This is similar - prefocus approximately where it's going to happen.  The auto focus takes about 1 second in well lit areas but might hunt if it's too dark, zoomed in too far or a combination of both / contrast.<br />I've heard a few people complain that the eyelet on the right side jabs them in the palm when holding the camera.  I'm not sure where they grab it but I found that it fits perfectly in front of the webbing of my index and middle finger - doesn't touch.  Also on the left side there are a series of buttons on the lens housing.  I've never come close to bumping these.  It never occurred to me to hold it that way.  With my left hand I support the camera with my thumb and index finger from the bottom, centered under the lens.  To use the buttons I rotate my thumb up.<br />The flash is centered well above the center of the lens.  I believe this contributes significantly to the near elimination of red-eye.  I don't think I've caught even a trace of it so far.  Also the red eye option from the flash menu actually lights up a white light on the camera positioned just below the shutter release and power switch.  This has also worked well and avoids the \"strobe\" effect of the flash prior to actually firing.  I always thought that was annoying.<br />My only complaint with the camera is that it doesn't have a factory option to use filters.  There are third party products to get around this, most notable is device that screws into the tripod bracket and has an adjustable arm that sticks out in front of the camera and will hold a filter in front of the lens.  I haven't purchased one yet, but plan to.<br />Before spending the kind of cash that this one is going to set you back, go to a local store and feel one in your hands.  I think it's a fantastic piece of engineering, built very solid with the largest feature set I've seen in a single camera (without cutting corners).  If you make a living  with your camera then I'm sure you will find it's missing some spinbobulator that just doesn't cut it in your case however it's a lot of fun to use and will satisfy the needs and growth of almost anyone that doesn't truely require the giant step up to a D-SLR.","The 8x zoom and 5 megapixels finally lured me from film about 6 months ago. I am a nature/landscape photographer using medium and large format, and gave up my 35mm equipment a few years ago. I just came back from a month long trip to the Antarctic, and the prints I've made from the Nikon are sharp,in focus, and colorful. Plusses: very good lens, great zoom, excellent meter compensation for different light levels (think ice); good color balance; good beginner photo software;a heckuva lot lighter than a view camera.  Minuses: shutter lag is annoying for action shots; forget the digital zoom; automatic preview gets in the way of repeated shots (can be overridden); buy an extra battery. Overall: This is a great little camera with the right mix of automatic features for the beginner, but with plenty of options to appeal to the more advanced (and particular) photographer. Put it on a tripod and it's awesome. Well worth the price premium over lesser offerings.","I've had my Coolpix 5700 for a couple of months. It's a great camera except for its autofocus function when the subject is not well illuminated. The autofocus circuit is based on contrast detection through the lens by analyzing the real picture (when on focus, the picture displays maximim contrast) as opposed to most other cameras which bounce off the subject an infrared beam and mesure the signal delay to determine the distance. The contrast detection technique is definitely more accurate as the camera precisely knows which part of the picture it is analyzing. The infrared beam bouncing is not equally as accurate, and it requires that the lens has a great depth of field so that the picture is compensated for slight inaccuracies in focusing. All in all, it's a great camera, definitely in a league in itself. Its lens is exceptionally good quality. I also bought the wide angle lens for it. The picture quality is superb even with the wide angle adapter.<br />The quality of the product is definitely consistent with what you would expect from Nikon, and I am hoping that they will offer soon a corrective firmware for the autofocus issue.","I purchased the Nikon 5700 for travel in India. I have used the camera in a two month period to make over 500 pictures from the rain forest of Southern India to 7 degree temperatures in the United States. The zoom ability, pixel strength, and ease of use have proven themselves. I came to the camera from extensive use of Nikon SLRs 35mm. I have enjoyed the transition and capabilities of this camera. I thought it would be a backup, simple use camera but have found it to work in all situations, panarama, portrait and macro. 4 of us went on the trip to India all armed with digital cameras. The quality of my photos, especially the enlargements stole the show. Another Nikon quality product!!","Yes the Nikon 5700 does everything it is supposed to do and it takes wonderful pictures.  But there are limitations.  The control buttons are very lite to the touch and you are apt to at the wrong resolution, speed,  or image count if you accidently touch the controls.  Also the camera takes many seconds to focus automatically and you are apt to lose an important image.  The telephoto controls are difficult to use accurately.<br />Again, for great pictures, it is a great camera, but there are limitations and it can be difficult to use.  But I would buy it again.","This is my 3rd digital camera and the first that has a large enough resolution per photo to enlarge well past 4x6.  The zoom action is wonderful.  And yes, I like the small lightweight size ~ such a difference from my SLR.<br />I have found the menus and manual modes very easy to learn.  I've just had the camera a couple weeks but I'm thrilled with it.<br />I do have a **QUESTION** for other Nikon Coolpix 5700 owners:<br />I bought a 256m Sandisk Compact Flashcard along with the camera, as recommended by one of your reviewers.  However, the Nikon manual states a flashcard range from 16-128m.  Before I open the packaging of the 256m I'd appreciate assurance that I am not limited to a 156m card, as I was with a previous digital camera.","This is my first digital camera and I LOVE it!! It makes me seem like a professional photographer even though I'm just a snapshot taker.<br />What surprised me most was the clear pictures and the resolution. On the basic setting I get large pictures that I can reduce on my computer and they look WONDERFUL.<br />Shooting in low light is a problem, but I have not taken the time to learn about F stops and all that can be configured. Almost everything can be configured on this.<br />The 8 times zoom is something I just love.<br />I almost bought an Olympus E-20, but am glad I got this one. It's a little smaller, which is very nice and it performs very well.<br />I could have spent my money buying a ]$$$$] camera, but I'm glad I went all the way and got something I just love.","Have had the camera for about a week and find that on auto that it is easy to use but once you go into the menus, there is a steep learning curve that will take forever to learn and it is very frustrating.  The image quality to my eye is amazing again on auto but on manuel sometimes it works and other times it refuses to work.  The flash is so bright that it washes out things and so I have to go to the low light flash and it is again not readily available but have to push buttons to get there.  I am not sure had I really known all of this I would have bought this camera but maybe gone for dslr instead.  Check it out carefully before you make this decision.","If you are willing to learn about photography and how to use a real camera - the 5700 coolpix is for you. I have had this camera and both love and hate it.<br />The reasons are:<br />1. It takes great pictures if you learn how to operate the camera. For me, it was often out of frustration that compelled me to take better photographs.<br />2. It made me a better photographer because I was forced to learn what Shutter priority, Aperture priority, White Balance are.<br />3. The EVF (electronic view finder) is horrific in the dark - You are literally shooting in the dark.<br />4. Battery consumption is horrendous - get the MB-E5700 battery grip!","owed Nikon 35 mm cameras in the past, and for the $$ this is the best going, pic quality great, takes some learning, but the video if u can. may great features, only problem i found was the lack of a lens thread that would take filters, this is easly solved by many aftermarket suppliers. get an extra battery. resoultion is as good as any 35mm camera up to 16X20. light weight and extremly well built, but again, does have a learning curve. and also loved the 60sec video. great for vacations. impressed with the quality in relation to the D series cameras. best value for the money....","There is nothing like a Nikon lens.  The clarity, the guarantee that every shot will be perfect.<br />I traded up from the Coolpix 995 (somehow it was a bit too small and the winding motion just didn't suit me).  This is more like an SLR in size.  The 5700 is packed with goodies and if you have had any experience at all with the Coolpix series, then this baby will be a cinch to use.  As it was, I was able to use it right out of the box.<br />Improvements?  On Auto, the camera decides when you need a flash and it will automatically pop it up for you.  View finder or screen?  With a fold shut LCD screen, you can view your pictures there or use the familiar viewfinder.  And Zoom?  This camera practically reinvents the zoom.  It's quite simple to use.  Then, as you get the hang of basic pictures, you can get far more advanced with it.<br />So.  Why only four stars?  First off, it is compact but a tad bit too small.  Gripping it is a bit of an oddity.  Even the manual highly recommends that you always use the neck strap.  But the biggest gripe I have is, how can they charge so much for this camera and ship it with an 8 MB card?  People are going to use this to get the best picture results so they're going to pump it up to the highest resolution available.  How many pictures do you think will fit on a card that small?  Amazon.com tried to relieve the situation by sending along a slightly larger card but if you are serious about this camera, you have to buy at least a 128 (for vacations, etc., you'd be best with a 256).<br />So, the Nikon quality is still there.  A little bit smaller in size, a bit clumsy to handle and you have to do some added shopping but this is a camera that is worth it.","It's a very big camera in a very small package! Gorgeous images, lots of features, and it has the options and control available in a professional camera. What a great travel camera. Let's face it, if the camera's a burden to carry or to shoot with, the pictures won't get taken. Nikon has solved that problem with this small wonder. I'm a picky professional photographer, and this camera has returned the fun quotient to my travel shoots.","Today is my 15th day of Nikon Coolpix 5700 ownership.  Let me put to rest the \"too long to focus under low light\" rap--I just shot a beautiful photo of the not-yet-full moon, and I can count the mountains and craters.  Considering the fact that I bought this camera primarily for macro work and web publishing, I have yet to find anything that it does not do well.<br />  It does come with only 179 pages of instructions and it is covered with some 18 different buttons and external controls, but don't let that stop you!  You can start with it set on full Auto everything and use it like a high-end digital Brownie, or you can dig into the instructions and start to mine that Nikon pedigree.  My first shot was an Auto everything of my son, and it was stunningly gorgeous with very little help from me.  He was standing in a darkened stairwell and the 5700 saw him a lot better than I did.<br />  Is that Nikon pedigree worth it?  Oh yeah, you bet it is.  You will find your love of photography rekindled with this camera in your hands.","This camera takes amazingly detailed pictures and the colors are very true to-life.  I have been taking all of my pictures in FINE mode (the highest quality JPEG but not as high as the RAW mode) and can't imagine anything better.  I have printed out 8x10s on my 3 year old HP 970, and ordered prints through Snapfish.  I have to keep pulling them out to look at them because I can't believe how clear they are.<br />  On my computer screen (17\" Sony Trinitron)I can blow up pictures of my 3 year-old daughter to life size with no pixelation.  In fact, they get clearer initially as I zoom in because the picture resolution is greater than the screen resolution.  Nice software suite included which makes it easy to remove red-eyes, crop, etc.  I don't even bother with the red-eye flash mode anymore, just clean it up on the computer.  Plug-and-play with Windows XP is awesome.<br />  I have read other reviews about being unable to use the autofocus indoors which I don't understand. I bought this camera as gift for my wife and have been taking most of my pictures in our basement in very low light conditions over the past two weeks.  If I zoom into a dark corner from 40' away, it might take a few seconds but it always works.  After reading the manual when I first bought it, I did change the autofocus option to \"Spot\" from \"Matrix\".  This lets the camera just try to focus on the very center of the viewfinder/subject.  I went outside this evening and took a pictures of a neighbors' Christmas lights approximately 200' from my house and didn't have a problem with the autofocus.  The only problem I see with the autofocus would be with someone who was shooting action photos.  The autofocus does take a second or two to lock in.<br />  After the first day, I haven't even used the LCD.  To me it's much more natural to look through the viewfinder, and I haven't had any problems with it.  The camera fits perfectly in my hands; nice grip.<br />  The only issues I have seen with it so far are relatively minor to me (but they may be a bigger issue to someone else).<br />1.  Short battery life.  You will need at least 2, maybe 3.<br />2.  Save yourself some gas (or postage) and purchase at least 256 MB of memory when you buy the camera.  The card that comes with the camera is useless.  It's pointless to have a 5 MP camera if don't have the memory to store hi-res images.  You can fit about 104 on a 256 MB card in fine mode.<br />3.  Doesn't come with a power adapter.  You may want one.<br />4.  Nikon does not support filters on this camera.  I have traded e-mails with Nikon and the reason they don't is because filters will cause vignetting on most of the range of the 8x zoom.  It does come with lens cap.<br />Overall I am extremely satisfied with this camera.","The Coolpix 5700 is my 5th digital camera (3rd Nikon) - and no previous camera compares. The 8:1 zoom alone is worth the price of admission (it's what I'd been waiting for.)<br />Until this camera I had a firm rule of no camera without an optical viewfinder. I had seen too many digital camera users stuck in very bright or very low light, unable to use their cameras. I warily decided to make an exception based on the fact that in addition to other compelling features of this camera - e.g., 8:1 zoom, 5 megapixels -  I got through-the lens-viewing, albeit electronic. Well, this electronic viewfinder is so good that in my opinion this camera really is an SLR.  In fact, I don't know why they can't call it that. It does have viewing through the lens, whether there's a flip-up mirror or not. I would imagine terminology will eventually change to allow such cameras to be called \"Electronic SLRs.\"<br />I disagree with other reviews I've read that talk about a steep learning curve. I found learning this camera rapid and intuitive. Especially if you've used any of the previous Coolpix models, you'll find everything just where you would expect it to be, but more refined and elegant than in previous models. It is very easy to navigate the menus and to set up. And of course in the default full-auto mode it works just like any point-and-shoot. There's no reason anyone can't pick up this camera and use it right out of the box.<br />A reason why I haven't bought any previous high-end digital SLR was a concern about size and weight. I had to have a camera I could carry around my neck for bicycle touring.  Pictures I'd seen of the Coolpix 5700 made it look rather large and heavy. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's virtually the same size and weight as my previous Coolpix 995 - like a compact 35mm camera. It also is the easiest to grip and manipulate of any camera I've owned - it seems to cling to your hand. I love the easy shutter release button. A complaint about previous Coolpix's was that for me pressing the overly stiff and \"clicky\" shutter release button would cause the camera to move. No so with the 5700.<br />I love the fact that there is a large, REAL lens cap, cleverly designed so that it simply moves out with the zoom if you forget to take the cap off before power-up. I also like the real hot flash shoe. This camera's a winner - the best of any I've had.","I have been using the 5700 for a few days. Upgraded from Kodak DC290. Here are my comments:<br />Pros: Superb quality; amazing optics. very compact. easy to use. superb wide angle to telephoto zoom range. for most people, no need for any wide angle & telephoto attachments. what else can u ask for in a camera. Deserves to be included in the Nikon family. u need to spend an hour to read the manual to get the best out of it.<br />Cons: 2 issues u should take into consideration before u buy: (1) when lighting is low and u use the digital zoom, the image is most of the time out of focus. Plus, it takes 4-5 seconds after u press the trigger before it takes the picture. This is the ONLY problem with the 5700. I would have given it a 5 or even 6 stars if it could focus fast and accurately in low light situations. (2) I am still getting used to the LCD view finder. I have used the Nikon F2 and F2A for 20+ years and the DC290 for 2yrs. Both used \"regular\" viewfinder. If u dont find it convenient to use an LCD viewfinder, u may want to try another camera.","Can't find anything wrong with this camera. Takes great pictures, when you read the manual and understand its functions this camera is very user friendly. Fits comfortly in the hand when taking pictures. There are great extras that can be bought for this camera, external battery pack which holds six AA batteries which gives me hours of picture taking. I Love This Camera.","I have had the Coolpix 5700 since July 2002, and I am delighted with the photos I have taken and the compliments I have received on them.  I have taken some stunning photos and printed them onto 8 x 10 photo paper with incredible results.  I've even blown up tiny portions of pictures without any pixels becoming visible when printed!  The Coolpix has a number of features that make it a great camera, but it also has some drawbacks.<br />The 5700 has several different user modes that can be preprogrammed for different situations.  The auto modes are well-programmed if you don't want to set these items manually.  The auto-focus has several different settings (i.e. spot, matrix) and a manual override that comes in handy for photographing minute items such as spider webs that are too thin for the autofocus to \"see.\"  The 8X optical zoom is great for setting up shots without having to move.<br />The biggest drawback I have found with the 5700 is that it is useless for digiscoping.  I have a Swarovski spotting scope through which I want to take pictures (bird watching, etc.), but because of the size of the lens on the 5700, my pictures have severe vignetting.  If you want a great camera for digiscoping, I recommend the 4500.  Another disappointment is that the 5700 does not have the panorama assist feature that the 4500 has.<br />Overall, the picture quality and settings for the 5700 are great, but it has a couple of drawbacks depending on what you want to do with the camera.","The Nikon 5700 is one of the better ones you'll find around the thousand dollar mark, but it is not a point and shoot consumer camera. There are some problems in low light conditions if you keep everything on auto, but with numerous user settings you can program the camera itself to perform very well. I do find the icons somewhat cryptic and the LCD is too small. If you are an inexperienced photgrapher and don't know anything about aperture and shutter control you might want to look at the Sony F717. The complaints about the autofocus are unfounded. The autofocus is slow, but in most cases the problems are with the inexperience of the user, or maybe they just didn't read the manual. If you want an inexpensive creative tool, buy this camera. If you want something to take family pics on your vacation and are not interested in serious photography, don't waste your money.","Having been an early adopter for digital cameras, I've played with and owned many over the years.  My recent purchase of the Nikon 5700 has reignited my love for photography!  The camera gives you a ton of control (although I am still learning) and the lens is FABULOUS!  I love being able to zoom way in on the subject, frame and focus, and blur out the background the way that this great lens can.  The resolution on the resulting image is excellent, and I am very pleased with every image I've had printed at a service provider ...I highly recommend this camera for anyone who loves a little more control with their camera!","Bought the 5700 as an upgrade to my 800 because I need the extra megapixels and love it.  Had to prove to my wife that the upgrade is justified, so I took several photos today with both cameras, and the 5700 won hands down, giving me much better enlargements and better color, too.  ...  Am now ordering accessories from Amazon, especially a 128M compact  flash card, since Nikon only provides a pathetic 8M card...","This is my first digital camera. The sharpness of the images and the ability to manipulate images in the computer are astounding. I cropped out about one third of an image, saved it on a CD, then took it to a Kinko's and printed it on a Kodak machine. I blew it up to an 8x10. I swear, you'd think it was taken in a studio with a Hasselblad. Sending jpegs over email is so fast and easy a child could do it.<br />Here's my beef: I can't get the auto focus to work ... in low light. By low light, I mean ambient light indoors at night; say for example, taking snapshots at your kid's birthday party. It doesn't seem to matter what auto focus settings I use. This problem comes close to ruining the camera for me. Now, as I said, this is my first digital camera, so I have nothing to compare it to. I don't know if the Coolpix is better/worse/the same as other digital cameras. I am told that auto focus in low light is an issue for all digital cameras. Anyhow, be alert to that problem, try to research it, and ask yourself, if you can't take snapshots of your kid's birthday party, what good is it?","This camera rivals the [$] pro cameras on the market. Add a 1 Gig IBM Microdrive and you can take 134 photos in the high res. Raw format which will easily make a perfect 13x19 print that is true photo quality. The minimum density is fantastic so skin tones are beautiful, I was shooting with a Nikon N80 and scanning the transparencies with a Canon 4000 DPI scanner. That is both expensive and time consuming. This camera is about 80% as sharp as that combo...but with a better contrast range! My average session with a model is 6-8 rolls. With 2 microdrives I can achieve that quaintly with no computer necessary! And the cost of a single drive is recouped in 3 sessions (Film and processing costs eliminated).<br />Cons: Horrible low light sensitivity...Slow saving in the HiRes modes and the camera controls TOTALLY lock up while the cache is written to the disk/drive (after 3 consecutive shots in HiRes ONLY). You can shoot, but not change ANYTHING manually. This problem disappears in the JPEG modes which are fine for many applications. Autofocus is slow at extreme telephoto setting and in low light. AND the shutter release button delay is intolerable when using flash or in low light.<br />So if you want to do a lot of action photography pick another camera. If however, you want the sharpest image for the least money then buy the Nikon Coolpix 5700. And buy several extra batteries and as large a storage device as you can afford.","I've had two other Nikon 35mm film cameras  over the past 15 years and I bought the 5700 coolpix recently. It takes pictures equivalent to or better than the 35mm cameras. You will need a photo quality printer to get the full advantage of this digital camera.","I bought the Coolpix 5700 after I sold my older Sony DSC-P1 3.3MP camera. I missed the manual flexibility I had with my older SLR cameras and the 5700 gave me the best of both worlds, a point-and-shoot camera with Nikon's superb metering and autofocus, and full manual control over all of its functions. Pictures come out GREAT in 5MP (averaging 1.7MB each on 2560x1920 1:4 JPEG compression), handling is GREAT after you learn where everything is.<br />The included 16MB flash card is not very useful. You can store an average of 6 snapshots at 2560x1920 Fine (1:4) mode. So, Amazon was offering the Viking 512MB Compact Flash Card for less than $$ and I took it:<br />It gives me an average of 209 shots at 2560x1920 Fine (1:4) mode. So, I can be away from a computer for a while before the need to offload the pictures and format the card.<br />I'm sure other reviews on the net tells stories about how GREAT this camera is, but let me tell you about my disappointments:<br />- I feel I should make a comment on the battery, Nikon did a good job by making one battery for the entire Coolpix line, this makes it easier for you to buy extra batteries when needed. However, an extra battery is a MUST. That's why Nikon included the external battery charger with the camera, you can charge a battery while you use one (my old Sony had a power supply that plugged into the camera, which tied up the camera during charging times.)<br />- I usually install a UV filter on my SLR cameras to protect the lens, I failed to find a UV filter for the 5700 and no adapters are available yet for it. I noticed that the Coolpix 4500 has a standard 28mm thread, which could have been made for the 5700.","I've been searching for another digital camera since I sold my old one (Koday DC4800).  The two I was thinking about after a lot of research was the Minolta Dimage 7i and the Nikon 5700.  They are so neck and neck it was hard to choose.  I finally decided to go with the Nikon because of it's reputation as a quality camera, the 8x optical zoom (don't ever bother getting a camera based on its digital zoom, digital zoom is horrible), and the MP quality.  The main reason why I didn't get the minolta was the battery choice they made.  My first digital camera (Agfa ephoto 1680) used AA and it ran out within an hour of using it and swore I'd never do it again.  That camera was only a 1.? MP camera, the minolta is a 5 so you can imagine how bad it'll drain the batteries.  This camera can use different kinds but primarily uses a rechargable Li-ion.  And if you want, get the optional battery pack and you can use AA if you want (maybe a good idea if you don't want to spend the high price for extra Li-ion batteries).  Also since it's a 8x optical zoom you really only need to get the wide angle lens so you'll save money there.  My experience has shown that I have needed a wide angle a lot more than a telephoto lens.","[Note: I have revised this review, originally written August 2002, to reflect the fact that better cameras are now on the market from other manufacturers.]<br />If you are an advanced amateur -- someone who likes to take really nice pictures for aesthetic reasons, in additon to occasional ordinary snaps -- this camera will impress you with its quality.<br />Having now tried several thousand shots under varying conditions, I am quite pleased with the Nikon Coolpix 5700. It was a good purchase, and worth the price. The photo quality is definitely comparable to most 35mm cameras. The camera combines subtle color sensitivity, good brightness sensitivity, and extreme detail in the images. The range of the zoom lens is wonderful. Controls are available for almost everything an advanced amateur would want. The included software (with included USB cable) makes image transfer to the PC, and previewing a big set of photos, very easy.<br />You NEED to read the manual to use the advanced features of this camera. You can leave it set to full-auto, hand it to a friend, and just say \"press here to take a picture,\" but to get the full benefit of the camera you'll need to understand some rather elaborate controls, some of which are un-guessable. After I invested 90 minutes to read the manual, my shots went from good to breathtaking. Since getting this camera I have not taken one single photo using my rather nice Canon EOS 35mm film camera -- it's all digital for me now.<br />Though the camera is far smaller than \"8x zoom\" would lead you to believe, and smaller than an SLR camera, you'll still want to use two hands. And there is no way you'll be putting it in any sort of pocket -- it's not something you'll carry around just in case you want to take a snapshot.<br />The single included battery lasts for well over 100 shots, assuming you don't use the flash much AND you use the viewfinder instead of the larger preview monitor. But frequent flash use drains it quickly, so if that's your need, order a second battery. And you'll NEED a larger memory card (128 to 512 MB is reasonable), so go ahead and order the extra memory card now.<br />There are lots of semi-advanced features for the photo buff -- too many to list here. If you like messing with settings and trying different things, you'll like this camera. If you just want to turn it on and shoot without thinking, this is not the model for you.<br />The main weaknesses I'd still like to see improved all relate to action photography: (1) a noticeable delay between pressing the button and taking the shot; (2) a slow auto-focus motor, sometimes painfully slow ;(3) high-speed shooting only at low resolution. One other weakness is that resolution in the new digital viewfinder is not even close to the sharpness of a normal 35mm SLR optical viewfinder -- it doesn't show you enough pixels.<br />A further very real weakness is that this camera has extreme difficulty auto-focusing in dim light. Even if you intend to use a flash, that doesn't help the camera focus. And due to the above-mentioned viewfinder, you can't manually focus very well with this camera. So if you intend to shoot much in very dim light (e.g., indoors at night), this is NOT the model to choose.<br />While there is room for improvement, and it's showing its age vs the competition, this camera is feature-packed and fun to use and takes photos of the highest quality. And you could not pry the 8x optical zoom lens away from me now that I've seen what it can do -- I could not go back to my previous digicam with 3x optical zoom.<br />If you want to read even more, the \"Steve's Digicams\" reviews website has extensive details on this fine camera. I've been quite pleased with mine -- but I got it a while ago, and the competition has definitely improved since then.","It's obviously a great camera and there are many pros. I'm sure it's not a problem to find what's great. I've spent some time comparing this camera with others so I want to share what cons I've found.<br />1. Motorized zoom. Many people feel much better about manual zoom ring.<br />2. Price. It's a few hundred dollars higher then close competitors.<br />3. Proprietary batteries. Usually proprietary means less freedom and higher price.<br />4. Zoom range. It's very impressive 35-280mm but if you take wide angle shots (e.g. inside small rooms or shoot buildings on narrow streets) then you might prefer to have zoom starting at 28mm...<br />Everything else is just either perfect or very good.","I owned a Nikon N70, then switch to digital Kodak DC4800.  Both are excellent camera of its class.  Now I switch to Nikon Coolpix 5700, and realized this is THE camera to own if money is no object.  Nikon's metering system with build-in speed light create excellent night time pictures.  The focusing is excellent at daytime, and a little slower at night, but by manually adjusting the ISO setting, Apeture and shutter speed, you can easily get an excellent night time picture.  The size of the camera is bigger than most compact, but much smaller than most SLR camera.  Easily held with just one hand, comfort grib, and the magnesium alloy body is professionally built.<br />The lens, oh man, the lens, is the best feature because of Nikon's ED lens, 8x optical zoom, this camera can easily shoot sporting event pictures with ease.  The 5-megapixel prints are unbelieveable.  The best thing about a high mega-pixel camera is that you take the picture, you CROP the picture down, and it's still so detail and clear.<br />I have always kept my Nikon N70, even when I was using the kodak DC4800.  Now, I can truly say that I will be selling my Nikon N70, and my two lens, because the new Nikon Coolpix 5700 replace the performance of my Nikon N70, and it's 8x zoom lens is almost the equivalent of my 35-80mm and 70 to 300mm lens.<br />Keep in mind that this camera does consume power, a fully charged battery will only last about 70 minutes, because both the LCD display or the eletronic viewfinder consume power.<br />Unfortunately, I brought my Nikon 5700 from a New York retailer that sent me a japanese model, but it's still the same camera, only that if it breaks down, Nikon will now repair it, even if you want to pay cash for the repair.  Therefore, if you worry about camera breaking down, you have to make sure it's a USA model.  One last thing, there are too many features the camera have for me to mention here.  The most important point is that this camera has all major control of a profession SLR if you want to use it, it also can be fully automated to take picture with your worry.  Its size to to big at all to carry for a 10 days even thought its not as small as other digital camera.  Its lens has a great optical zoom range that will let you capture details photographs.  And the quality, the workmanship of this camera is first class all the way.","I just bought the 5700 after using a 5000 for 8 months. When I bought the 5000, I found four things I didn't like about it: Not enough telephoto, flash sensor in bad location resulting in severly underexposed flash photos, on/off switch a little difficult to use, and the lens cap had to be removed in order to turn on the camera. The 5700 corrects all of these things with up to 280 mm (35 mm equivalent) maximum focal length. The on/off switch is just like the one on the 5000 but it is easier to turn. Both the 5000 and 5700 seem to be the same camera as far as features and quality are concerned. The LCD monitor on the 5700 is a little smaller but it is clear and sharp. The 5700 has an electronic view finder which I was concerned about before I was able to try it out. It is just a miniature LCD monitor and it is surprisingly good, even in low (relative) light conditions. Only one monitor can be on at a time which saves power consumption. It is a little deeper in size than the 5000, but that's necessitated by the long focal length of this camera. I love using this camera. I highly recommend the Nikon Coolpix 5700 camera.<br />Update after 3 months.  I recently took my 5700 and my N80 with me on a vacation to Colorado and Utah visiting nat'l parks.  I like the electronic view finder very much as it displays what the picture will look like with any adjustments I have set, i.e. exposure compensation.  I never took my N80 out of its bag.  I took over 600 pictures and I was extremely happy with its use and its results.  This is one mighty fine camera!"]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P2","amazon_reviews":["...and it rules.

My first is that I can't figure out how to make auto flash come on when I start the camera. For some reason it always goes to no flash, so you have to remember to turn the flash on.

Depending on the different quality settings it can hold as many as 1700 pictures (640 x 480, standard quality) or as little as 120 pictures (1600 x 1200, fine quality).

A great buy!","I got mine from bestbuy for about 300 bucks and I'm really satisfied with it, 2 megapixels are just enough to make a good quality photo without having to buy an aditional hard drive for all them pictures (if this is your first digicam trust me you gonna make hundrets of them). Its easy to use point and shoot camera but it still has quite few features and settings that will make that special shot just perfect. Its small metal body fits to any pocket so you can take it with you anywere. A biger memory stick is a must, trust me it will fill up fast.<br />Not to long ago I also purchased an LCM-PX carying case which is also great, it's small, fits the cmera perfectly, you can ware it on your belt like a beeper or a celphone and when the oportunity comes you'll never miss that great shot.

So stop thinking about it and just get it, for your self or as a gift to others (trust me they won't be disapointed)","This camera has it all, an for a great price! Over 2.0 megapixels for some awesome quality, a built in battery and charger that lasts for a minimum of 60 minutes with the LCD on, 16 MB memory stick, USB interface, all operating system support, video capaturing, 6X zoom ,ect ect ect. Great for Professional Business such as real estate appraisals, and other purposes for mass use. Highly recommended!","When I first started shopping around for a digital camera I wasn't really sure what was important to me.  Finally I figured out that what I really wanted was:<br />1)not to replace my normal camera so 2Mpixels would do just fine<br />2)minimum 3x optical zoom (didn't care about digital)<br />3)something small<br />4)under $400<br />5)movie mode with sound<br />Now that I have the Sony P2 here are my likes and dislikes:<br />Likes -<br />1)it is one of the smaller cameras out there - great for travel<br />2)I love the movie mode, which is only limited by the size of your memory stick<br />3)I like the fact that you can turn off the digital zoom so that you don't accidentally use it<br />4)The menu system is intuitive and easy to use<br />5)The battery is much smaller than I expected - the camera is not heavy at all (yet still has a solid feel)<br />6)You can plug the camera right into your TV to view the photos and movies<br />7)You can easily change between NTSC and PAL video formats which will be great when I go back home to the UK for a visit<br />8)Has automatic scene lighting for when you are in a dark place - works really well<br />9)Rechargable battery holds quite a good life - easily enough for a full day's outing<br />Dislikes -<br />1)You have to wait much longer between shots than with a conventional point and click camera (2-3sec maybe)<br />2)I knew the 16Mb Memory Stick wasn't going to be nearly enough so I just ordered a 128Mb one with the camera (more money)<br />3)I like having a rechargable battery, but the down side is if it runs out you've had it unless you carry a spare (which are small and light, but again - more money to spend)<br />Bottom Line -<br />I personally would buy this camera again.  It ended up being a little more than I really wanted to spend, once I added on extra memory and spare battery, but I haven't regretted it.  I am also contemplating getting a case for it to protect the viewing screen, but I don't think this is a requirement as long as you are careful.<br />I didn't give this 5 stars because of the shot delay and the fact the you really need to buy extra memory."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P7","amazon_reviews":["This is a well-built, inexpensive, quality camera which the right photographer (that would be me) is able to take quality pictures with ease.

We have upgraded twice since and now use a Sony DSC-H10 Cybershot.  I'm buying a new lithium battery for it and will be giving it to my son on his 4th birthday.  I recommend saving your old cameras for this very reason.  They want to sell horrible quality pictures for the kids cameras.  I know they are supposed to be \"kid tough\", but if they aren't old enough to explain how to use one, what is the point?!","I've had this camera for a bit over 4 years.  It was with me in Hawaii, Peru, Germany, and all over California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah.  It took awesome pictures.  When I printed out pics, people always asked me \"and that little camera took these pics?\".  Yes!<br /><br />The short-comings: there was always a delay in certain conditions, which I lost many good pics to.  Sometimes the shutter only opened halfways, with me noticing only later when I downloaded the pics - pics lost forever!<br /><br />Battery life was very very poor, drove me nuts.<br /><br />So now it finally died.  Bought new battery, nothing, will return battery.<br /><br />I loved this little camera, despite its short-comings, it will be hard  to replace with another compact.","I have had this camera for almost 4 years and it has been amazing up until recently.  When I first bought it, I had researched many different styles and found this to be the best.  It took great pictures under most conditions, however I have always had problems taking rapid shots and especially with taking pictures in low light.  Overall I would have recommended this camera to anyone.  1000 pictures later, this camera has failed me.  The pictures now come out blurry, if they take at all, and the batteries are giving out on me.  I am very dissapointed with it and while at one point, it was the smallest and most popular model, now I think any consumer would be better off with a different model.  Think twice before purchasing this camera, I think there are better options out there.","i've owned this model for three years and it JUST gave out on me. The camera takes great photos, but sometimes stalls when you want to take that instant photo, so a lot of the \"kodak moments\" end up being staged since you have to wait around for shutter and all the redeye flashing to stop.<br /><br />the camera plugs into a computer nicely with the USB cable, making transferring photos a snap.<br /><br />The power source for the camera is a specific battery which doesn't last long, which was a problem on weeklong trips away from the charger.<br /><br />The shutter mechanism failed about one year into usage.<br /><br />But the thing's a workhorse, as i've taken about 1000 pics with it over the years. good starter camera","This camera is really easy to use and you can take great pictures with it. I bought it two years ago and it still seems to be a good value for the price I paid. One of the features that I liked is the fact that it can record videos. I was thinking about buying a camcorder, but decided to buy this one instead. The quality of the video is Ok, not great. Currently, cameras with higher resolution can record better videos.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this model to anyone who wants to buy a digital camera.","I've had this camera for over 1 year now and I am nothing but satisfied.  When I decided that I wanted a digital camera it was important for me to get one that was small enough not to impede on my active lifestyle yet did not compromise on technical ability.  Sony's DSC P7 is the perfect mix.  I travel a lot internationally and so I just put it in my pants pocket and keep the charger in my luggage.  You can snap about 300-400 pictures before the battery dies.  The menu functions are very user friendly and allow you to highly customize the settings.<br />There is also no compromise on other aspects.  The movie quality is not perfect but really good and the sound is excellent.  Another thing that is annoying about most digital cameras is how long it takes for the picture to snap.  With this one, it takes the picture as soon as you push the button.  This is also true with the movies.  I know on some digital cameras when you are done recording a movie you have to wait a while for it to \"save\" to the flash memory.  Not with this one; Sony seems to have gotten the right idea in that, flash memory should work in a flash.  The only problem I have with it is that sometimes in extremely low-light conditions when the flash is imperative, you have to wait about 6 seconds for the flash to build up.  But just to reiterate, this doesn't happen in the light.  The other cool thing is the memory stick.  You can get 512MB sticks and you can even buy generic ones (from the same company that makes them for Sony) at half the price Sony charges.  The picture quality is outstanding.  The user can select a variety of qualities along with visual effects such as B&W, etc...<br />To recap: It responds quickly to user commands, picture quality is excellent, it's small & light, it's not that expensive, and the movies have excellent quality sound with very good video.<br />Bottom Line:  I'm a tough customer but the Sony DSC7 gets 5-stars because it deserves it.","This is a well-built, inexpensive, quality camera which the right photographer (that would be me) is able to take quality pictures with ease.

I recommend saving your old cameras for this very reason.  They want to sell horrible quality pictures for the kids cameras.  I know they are supposed to be \"kid tough\", but if they aren't old enough to explain how to use one, what is the point?!","I've had this camera for a bit over 4 years.  It was with me in Hawaii, Peru, Germany, and all over California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah.  It took awesome pictures.  When I printed out pics, people always asked me \"and that little camera took these pics?\".  Yes!<br /><br />The short-comings: there was always a delay in certain conditions, which I lost many good pics to.  Sometimes the shutter only opened halfways, with me noticing only later when I downloaded the pics - pics lost forever!<br /><br />Battery life was very very poor, drove me nuts.<br /><br />So now it finally died.  Bought new battery, nothing, will return battery.<br /><br />I loved this little camera, despite its short-comings, it will be hard  to replace with another compact.","I have had this camera for almost 4 years and it has been amazing up until recently.  When I first bought it, I had researched many different styles and found this to be the best.  It took great pictures under most conditions, however I have always had problems taking rapid shots and especially with taking pictures in low light.  Overall I would have recommended this camera to anyone.  1000 pictures later, this camera has failed me.  The pictures now come out blurry, if they take at all, and the batteries are giving out on me.  I am very dissapointed with it and while at one point, it was the smallest and most popular model, now I think any consumer would be better off with a different model.  Think twice before purchasing this camera, I think there are better options out there.","i've owned this model for three years and it JUST gave out on me. The camera takes great photos, but sometimes stalls when you want to take that instant photo, so a lot of the \"kodak moments\" end up being staged since you have to wait around for shutter and all the redeye flashing to stop.<br /><br />the camera plugs into a computer nicely with the USB cable, making transferring photos a snap.<br /><br />The power source for the camera is a specific battery which doesn't last long, which was a problem on weeklong trips away from the charger.<br /><br />The shutter mechanism failed about one year into usage.<br /><br />But the thing's a workhorse, as i've taken about 1000 pics with it over the years. good starter camera","This camera is really easy to use and you can take great pictures with it. I bought it two years ago and it still seems to be a good value for the price I paid. One of the features that I liked is the fact that it can record videos. I was thinking about buying a camcorder, but decided to buy this one instead. The quality of the video is Ok, not great. Currently, cameras with higher resolution can record better videos.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this model to anyone who wants to buy a digital camera.","I've had this camera for over 1 year now and I am nothing but satisfied.  When I decided that I wanted a digital camera it was important for me to get one that was small enough not to impede on my active lifestyle yet did not compromise on technical ability.  Sony's DSC P7 is the perfect mix.  I travel a lot internationally and so I just put it in my pants pocket and keep the charger in my luggage.  You can snap about 300-400 pictures before the battery dies.  The menu functions are very user friendly and allow you to highly customize the settings.<br />There is also no compromise on other aspects.  The movie quality is not perfect but really good and the sound is excellent.  Another thing that is annoying about most digital cameras is how long it takes for the picture to snap.  With this one, it takes the picture as soon as you push the button.  This is also true with the movies.  I know on some digital cameras when you are done recording a movie you have to wait a while for it to \"save\" to the flash memory.  Not with this one; Sony seems to have gotten the right idea in that, flash memory should work in a flash.  The only problem I have with it is that sometimes in extremely low-light conditions when the flash is imperative, you have to wait about 6 seconds for the flash to build up.  But just to reiterate, this doesn't happen in the light.  The other cool thing is the memory stick.  You can get 512MB sticks and you can even buy generic ones (from the same company that makes them for Sony) at half the price Sony charges.  The picture quality is outstanding.  The user can select a variety of qualities along with visual effects such as B&W, etc...<br />To recap: It responds quickly to user commands, picture quality is excellent, it's small & light, it's not that expensive, and the movies have excellent quality sound with very good video.<br />Bottom Line:  I'm a tough customer but the Sony DSC7 gets 5-stars because it deserves it.","I got this camera for my wife as a Christmas present.  I did alot of research and tried several brands and models before I decided to give her the Cybershot DSC P7.  One of the strong selling points for this camera was the ease of use.  The menu interface for the camera was easy and it made sense.  It's ergonomics are excellent, it is lightweight, and compact.  This camera is very forgiving and allows us to take almost flawless pictures regardless of the lighting situation we put it in.  The delay between when you press the button and when the picture is taken is minor, but it might be an issue when you're trying to capture an action shot (I normally pre focus by focusing on the subject and holding down the shutter button halfway and it works).  If you want a camera that captures action, you'd probably do better by sticking with the SLR cameras.<br />The LCD screen is crisp, but you'll need to use the view finder on a bright sunny day.  The digital video is fair to below normal meaning you'd get better quality with a camcorder because the cybershot has a lower frames per second ratio, but it is nice to have the \"movie\" option in a camera.  With a 128MB stick you can record up to 5 to 6 minutes of footage at the highest resoulution.<br />Other features are the multiburst mode (for your golf swing, etc.), night mode (use a tripod), white balance (snow or beach pictures), 10 second timer, multi and center focus, and a red eye reduction.<br />We have noticed that our picture taking has increased 300 percent since we've started using the cybershot.  I would definitely recommend that you purchase the 128MB memory sticks. We can put about 80 to 90 pics on a 128MB stick depending on the resolution we choose.  Also buy an extra battery.<br />This camera was designed for the average person, primarily the  point and shoot crowd so it may lack some of the manual and advanced settings professionals prefer.  Overall, it is a fun camera that is easy to use and I think that makes up for any advanced features it lacks.<br />***Update*** 10-21-2003<br />Still No problems with the camera.  Now that we've used it for<br />almost a year, we kind of wish that there were some lens accessories to increase the optical zoom. It still takes wonderful family pictures which is what we bought it for.","I replaced my old Sony DSC-50 1.3MP camera for this one.  Clearly, the picture quality is better, and I really like the quality of the pictures in low light.  However, the battery is poor in my opinion.  I barely get 1/2 hour of battery life during sustained use.  My old Sony had an usually powerful battery.  I would fill up my memory stick long before the battery would run out.  I suspect the size of the battery is the reason.  My old camera used the same battery that is currently used to power their camcorders (M series).  This camera uses a very tiny battery, so it stands to reason it wouldn't last as long, but anyone buying this camera would do well to consider a 2nd battery.","I agree with the other reviewer that said that there's a major problem with the shutter delay on this camera. If you want to photograph action, this camera is not for you because you never get the picture you want. Other than that, this is a wonderful,  easy so use camera with tons of effects that I'm still finding out about after three months of owning this (I had no idea you could zoom in on the pictures you've already taken.)","I shopped for months for a Digital Camera, and it was worth the wait. The DSC-P7 is a great camera. It's easy to use, and downloads are a breeze.  Pictures are crystal clear.","After much research and changing my mind several times, I finally decided to go with a compact camera.  I chose the P7 over the S230 because it was easier to hold while taking pictures.<br />This camera is extremely easy to use.  Even my 5 year old son can use it and take adequate pictures.  The quality of the images has been excellent.  The outdoor pictures are truly incredible.  I have been in two low light situations and the camera has performed very well.  Like any point and shoot, the flash does have limited range.  Apparently there is an external flash available with this camera.  That might be a worthwhile consideration for events like weddings where you can't always be front and center.  The camera is very slim and fits easily in a coat or pant.  The LCD is very bright and clear, but because it is so small, it is often difficult to detect if the image is slightly out of focus.<br />The battery life seems pretty good.  If you don't need the flash, I would guess that you could take pictures for the better part of the day, especially if you turn off the LCD.  With the flash and LCD on, I took about 85 pictures before the battery died out.  The charging of the battery is very convenient.  Because the power cord plugs directly into the camera, you can use the power cord to power up the camera if it is turned on or if the camera is off, then it will charge the battery.  The battery life remaining displayed in the LCD is also very useful.<br />The 16mb memory stick that comes with the camera is woefully insufficient.  Plan on buying a larger memory stick.  I bought a 128mb Lexar memory stick ...  It works flawlessly with the camera.  I have installed the USB drivers that come with the software on both a Win98 system and an IMac OS9 and both handle the download/upload between camera and computer with ease.  I have not played with it too much, but the editing software seems kind of clumsy.  For making prints, I have been taking my memory stick into [a local store] and using their Fuji machines to edit the images.  The prints have come out great ...<br />So far I have found myself taking many more pictures than I did with a film camera.  At the party and wedding I went to, all of my friends had a great time looking at the pictures on the LCD and have really enjoyed the images that I have emailed to them.  I know that a lot of people have digital cameras so I am surprised that more people don't bring their cameras with them because it really is fun to use.  Anyway, I highly recommend this camera.","I have previously used a Nikon Coolpix and Canon Digital ELPH. The Sony is far and away the best camera out of the three. Extremely crisp images, also has a letterbox feature (so you can take pictures in widescreen format if you want, which looks pretty cool). I would've liked if the digital video was captured at a higher res, but I can't complain since this is the only camera out of the 3 I've used that allows unlimited video capture (the only limitation is the size of the media) and audio. Also has some cool image effects- you can add sepia tones or take negative exposures. The menu is easy to use. The camera is sturdy without being too heavy, my only issues are battery life (about 1.5 hrs on a full charge, which is pretty standard but I'd expect more for the price) and the size of the provided memory stick- 16mb is ok if you're only using the lowest resolution, but to take advantage of the camera's full capabilites, including the digital video w/ sound, go out and get a 128mb stick as well.","I have previously used a Nikon Coolpix and Canon Digital ELPH.

Lighter than the Canon powershot (likely due to it's magnesium case; the powershot is stainless steel).  Takes wonderful pictures and loads very quickly and easily using XP.  Downside is that memory sticks only go to 128 right now while compact flash goes higher.  However, for myself and others who are casual photographers, 128 is more than enough.  Good sony quality and easy operation.  Highly recommended.","I highly reccomend this camera, it takes astounding pictures, stores them fast, and is very easy to use.  I especially like the case, which is all metal and looks great.  This is mostly a point and shoot camera, but has many customisable settings, and great battery life.  I usually get about 1 and a half hours of battery life, which is plenty to fill up my 128mb memory stick.  I reccomend buying a case and a bigger memory stick, because with the huge pics this camera takes, youll need more than what it comes with.  This camera is definitely worth the money, and i would be willing to pay even more for it.","I have a Sony Vaio Windows ME. I have no problem with the usb hookup nor are there any problems downloading pictures.<br />I would recommend this camera,The prints are okay and the color balance is pretty good. It has a lot of features that I find useful. I do think the memory stick price is too high.","just got it and am having lots of fun.<br />the movies definitly have sound, and it's very cool that they are not limited to a 30- or 60-second clip ... you can go as long as you have memory left.  And after you stop recording, you can cut off parts of movie files that weren't good, right from the camera (i.e. before transferring to your PC.)<br />still photos look great on the computer, but haven't tried to print them yet...<br />the camera is very small and has enough features for me, and the interface and controls are much simpler than other digicams i've seen.<br />i'd highly recommend it, just get a bigger memory stick and a spare battery.","For more than I increase the zoom... the results are the same...(even out&in doors) EXCELENT for the resolution that I was looking for.","It is very interesting how a few people reated this camera and said that they had movies with sound yet the Editorial review/documentation states that movies are silent, can anybody resolve this discrepancy?","Size was an important factor in buying this 3 megapixel camera, 3X optical zoom, and a decent video mode.  Although it may not take as nice pictures as the DSC S75, 85 or even the 717 model, the size of the camera is what really makes it attractive.<br />  I have taken this on a trip as it remained comfortably in my pocket.  I also purchased a 128 MB stick(79.95), the semi hard case(50.00), extra battery(60.00), and also the external slave flash(100.00).  Battery life was adequate as two batteries lasted about 3 days(I took 80 pictures total).<br />  My pictures came out really sharp with no problems.  Night shots turned out better than I thought they would, well I did have the slave flash:)  But I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a small compact camera, having much more features than sony's DSC U10 and U20 models.  A very big step up from those two.","Size was an important factor in buying this 3 megapixel camera, 3X optical zoom, and a decent video mode.

A very big step up from those two.","I had a hard time deciding whether to get this Sony DSC-P7 or the Canon PowerShot S230 Digital Elph.  I was looking for a small 3.2 MP camera.  I know some friends who each own one of these two cameras.  They were nice enough to each let me borrow their cameras so I was able to fully play with them for a few days before I decided which one to buy.  Although the S230 does capture images a little bit sharper, the P7 captures color better.  The P7 has 3X optical zoom compared to the S230's 2X.  The P7 comes with an AC adapter, the S230 does not (the P7's battery is charged directly on the camera while you must remove the S230's battery to charge it on a seperate charger).  I found that the S230 often produced red-eye and the P7 seldom did (and seldom does).  Luckily, you can correct red-eye on your computer.  Still, I would rather have a camera that produces photos that require the least editing as possible.  I would rather spend my time taking pictures! I wanted a camera that would fit in my jean pockets and although the S230 is a little smaller, the P7 is nontheless a tiny camera.<br />The quality of the MPEG movie clips with sound is great.  This feature, however would never replace my camcorder--but it is a nice feature to have when I do not want to lug around my Digital8 camcorder.  I also like the fact that the length of video capture time is only limited to the size of your Memory Stick.  If I am not mistaken, only with Sony cameras (and only with some Sony cameras) can you fill the memory up with only video footage.  Also, with the P7's Memory Stick, I am able to view and save photos directly onto my Clie organizer.<br />The size of the included 16 mb Memory Stick is insufficient.  I purchased a 128 mb stick and am able to fit over 80 photos set at the camera's highest resolution mode.  The photo quality is great.  The photo quality is not as good as some (and only a select few) of the much larger 3.2 mp cameras out there but for such a small-sized camera, the P7 is one mean machine.  I also thought of getting the DSC-P9 instead (with identicle shell/dimensions and features).  After reviewing several samples of the P9 that a friend of mine owned, I found that it was not worth spending an extra $100 dollars for the extra 0.7 mega-pixels.  The P9 is listed as a 4 mp camera but is actually a 3.9 mp.  The image quality is not much different.  Overall, I highly recommend the Sony DSC-P7 to anyone looking for a small camera that is able to produce photos with stunning quality.  The metal shell also looks very sleek and attractive.  I am glad I chose the DSC-P7 as I am enjoying it some much.  I do recommend purchasing a larger capacity Memory Stick (at least a 64 mb) and maybe an extra battery.","Small size is great.  They should have included a larger memory stick.  Buy a 128 MB stick for around 90 dollars and take 80 hi-res photos. Perfect for traveling. Sony needs to come up with a card reader that works with XP.","For something that fits into a shirt pocket, this little camera is full of features. I bought it to take with me on the plane to asia. I have a Nikon with all the \"stuff\", but this little Sony DSC-P7 is just great. I plan on doing lots of walking and I don't want to be lugged down by a camera bag.","The Sony DSC-P7 is a compact 3 Megapixel point-and-shoot camera for the casual photographer, with enough extra features and style to make it worth its higher-than-average price tag.  With 3 megapixels you'll be able to get very good prints up to even 8x10 inches.<br />The P7 is part of a series of similarly-designed cameras, the P2 and P9, the P2 with 2 Megapixels and the P9 with 4 Megapixels.  In essence the P7 is really an update to Sony's previous compact model, the P5, which has the same maximum megapixels but has fewer features.  The P7 is comparable to the P71, a less compact budget model with the same maximum megapixels but with a plastic body and a feature missing.<br />The P7 is really designed for the casual photographer.  It's small enough to keep in your pocket and well protected with an all-metal body.  It also offers the usual functions you'd expect, including zoom, timer mode, and auto focus.  Operation is simple because most of the settings, from focusing to white balance, can be set to automatic.  It even offers special modes for night shots and the hard-to-capture night portrait shots (night shots with both scenery and people are otherwise hard to get right without this mode).  Most of the time you'll get a good shot with everything on automatic, but it offers manual preset controls for white balance, exposure, and focus range when the situation calls for it.<br />Advanced features include an AF illuminator, optical zoom, and movie recording with sound.  The AF illuminator fires a red light on a subject to get the proper level of exposure when shooting in dark areas, which does produce a better picture.  The 3x optical zoom makes it easier to capture pictures from far away without losing quality, which usually happens with cameras that only have digital zoom.  Movie recording lets you save 320x240 pixel movies, which isn't quite TV quality but close enough.  Importantly, it can record sound, which the P71 doesn't lacks.<br />With all of these easy-to-use features crammed in a compact body, the P7 is easy to recommend even as a first camera.  Though the price tag is high, you get what you pay for in quality, features, and size.  For the budget-conscious, I would recommend the P71 because it has almost the same features and doesn't need expensive proprietary batteries, but for those who want to get the most reasonably priced 'premium' small camera, I highly recommend the P7."]},{"name":"Kodak EasyShare CX4230","amazon_reviews":["I got my EasyShare as a gift in 2002 and it just died, after all these years.  I used it a lot and would not hesitate to get another, but I've heard Kodak no longer provides software or support.  This camera was very easy to use and the pictures were always clear, even when I had them enlarged.  I never got the camera dock and just used the USB cable to download to my computer.  I started using AA batteries a couple of years ago, since the CRV3 lithium battery that came with the camera was no longer sold at our local stores.<br />Now looking for a camera as nice as this one....","Honestly the best Kodak camera I've ever used was an OLD 1mp from around 2000. A friend picked up this Kodak for $10 at a local Goodwill store just to tinker with. As a photography hobbyist they figured for $10 if it's TERRIBLE we can just toss it in the trash. Keep in mind they purchased this camera from the Goodwill store in the summer of 2007. With that being said, I just dug it out (surprised I still had it) to take some close-ups of my main camera which I just broke. I found some old pictures I'd taken with it which I will be uploading onto Amazon to share with others. I've tinkered with around a hundred digital cameras over the past 10 years from SLR's to camera phones and prefer to stick with point-and-shoot's. Here's some pros & cons with this one:<br /><br />Pros:<br />LCD Screen is present (not big, not super small but usable) & has viewfinder in case LCD breaks<br /><br />Memory: internal & SD slot<br /><br />Batteries: 2 AA's which are readily available (I've found the Energizer e2's to be the longest lasting disposables)<br /><br />Sturdy large-ish design, easy to hang onto<br /><br />Macro surprisingly decent<br /><br />Cons:<br />Eats batteries like there's no tomorrow<br /><br />SD card goes in seemingly backwards vs. most cameras<br /><br />Slow boot-up and camera shutter speed<br /><br />Menu can be a pain in the rear to navigate, camera doesn't remember any settings when turned off & back on<br /><br />Macro doesn't focus too well within 6\" from subject<br /><br />I honestly wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone unless they wanted a really cheap knock-around camera to keep in the car or something like that. Mine was stored for a year and now has about 10+ dead pixels in the photos it takes. For what it is and being a 2mp old-as-dirt model I think I'll still keep it around just in case I need it.","I have had this camera for over three years now and it is still working great.As far as batteries go, you need to use the reccomended CRV3 battery if you want the most life. The second choice would be rechargable batteries. The shutter speed takes time to get used to especially when you are trying to get a picture of your kids and they quit what they were doing so cute before it takes. The quality can not be beat for a 2mp camera. I currently have a 5mp Optimus camera also and even though the quality is higher, I prefer the Kodak for everyday pictures because it controls the lighting better with the white balance unlike most newer cameras with the automatic white balance that will not let you adjust it. Don't get me wrong I have had to work on it some but that is my fault because I let my children take pictures with it and has been dropped. I have replaced the battery cover. You can not get parts through Kodak but you can get parts for it on Ebay. The battery cover was remanufactured and was $10 on ebay. Also the lens cover will not close on its own, I have to lightly tap it but it does not interfere with the camera working. This is a great camera but I paid less than $100 for mine brand new, so search for better prices or for a higher MegaPixel camera for that price.","This is a pretty nice camera! I recieved it yrs. ago, and it still works great. Here are some pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros: Pretty nice 2.0 picture quality, easy transport from doc to computer, nice features, works pretty good, picture can be taken with the screen and an eye-through lens.<br /><br />Cons: Battery life not that long, battery wears out in a couple years, sometimes when the battery dies and needs to be charged you have to set the date & time again.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty nice camera, and if you're neady for one, and you find this one: GO FOR IT!!!","It's been over two years since I bought this camera and it's still going strong. After reading some of the more recent reviews I just wanted to touch on some subjects:<br /><br />Battery Life - Using 2300 mAh Ni-MH I can take over 70 top quality images, at least half with the flash on, on two batteries. During the hurricanes of 2004 that hit Florida I purchased a Lithium Ion battery cell for the camera and it's STILL in the camera and working perfectly!<br /><br />Image Quality - I'm a digital artist and know image artifacting and the differences between poor quality images and images worth printing. I've printed over a dozen 8x10s over the last two years and they've all come out beautiful. 4x6 prints that are well exposed are indistinguishable from 35mm prints.<br /><br />Imaging Speed - Yes, this, and every other point and shoot digital camera, has a slow recycle speed, some newer camera may be marginally faster but for something two years old this works as well if not better than any on the market at the time.<br /><br />In conclusion: BUY this camera if you can find one. It takes great pictures, it does NOT eat batteries as others have claimed and you can get some very nice archival prints from it. For the money I spent two years ago I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Please see my review from two years ago further down the list for more information on the Kodak CX4230.","I bought this camera on sale a couple years ago and the worst problem I have had with it is the silly KODAK policy of forcing you to use their imaging software when installing the driver.<br />This is aggravating since I have to re-install the driver every so often.  WHy can't they offer JUST the driver?<br />I now use WindowsXP's much better image retrieval system.  On my Windows2000 system the driver keeps getting lost and I end up having to reinstall it about every third use.<br />I too bought an extra memory stick (128mb) and use the camera for personal documentation and for taking gallery photos for church events to be used on their website.  I have never had any serious problem with the image quality as I always leave the camera set to best image setting.  It doesn't handle dark rooms very well, but then for $150, ... what camera would<br />I bought the docking device for an additional $50, but since the rechargable battery got to the point it wouldn't work longer than a couple of hours (the reason for my having the dockin station was the fact that it was supposed to recharge the battery) and the camera actually works faster just hooked up to the USB direct.","I got my EasyShare as a gift in 2002 and it just died, after all these years.

Here's some pros & cons with this one:<br /><br />Pros:<br />LCD Screen is present (not big, not super small but usable) & has viewfinder in case LCD breaks<br /><br />Memory: internal & SD slot<br /><br />Batteries: 2 AA's which are readily available (I've found the Energizer e2's to be the longest lasting disposables)<br /><br />Sturdy large-ish design, easy to hang onto<br /><br />Macro surprisingly decent<br /><br />Cons:<br />Eats batteries like there's no tomorrow<br /><br />SD card goes in seemingly backwards vs. most cameras<br /><br />Slow boot-up and camera shutter speed<br /><br />Menu can be a pain in the rear to navigate, camera doesn't remember any settings when turned off & back on<br /><br />Macro doesn't focus too well within 6\" from subject<br /><br />I honestly wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone unless they wanted a really cheap knock-around camera to keep in the car or something like that. Mine was stored for a year and now has about 10+ dead pixels in the photos it takes. For what it is and being a 2mp old-as-dirt model I think I'll still keep it around just in case I need it.","I have had this camera for over three years now and it is still working great.As far as batteries go, you need to use the reccomended CRV3 battery if you want the most life. The second choice would be rechargable batteries. The shutter speed takes time to get used to especially when you are trying to get a picture of your kids and they quit what they were doing so cute before it takes. The quality can not be beat for a 2mp camera. I currently have a 5mp Optimus camera also and even though the quality is higher, I prefer the Kodak for everyday pictures because it controls the lighting better with the white balance unlike most newer cameras with the automatic white balance that will not let you adjust it. Don't get me wrong I have had to work on it some but that is my fault because I let my children take pictures with it and has been dropped. I have replaced the battery cover. You can not get parts through Kodak but you can get parts for it on Ebay. The battery cover was remanufactured and was $10 on ebay. Also the lens cover will not close on its own, I have to lightly tap it but it does not interfere with the camera working. This is a great camera but I paid less than $100 for mine brand new, so search for better prices or for a higher MegaPixel camera for that price.","This is a pretty nice camera! I recieved it yrs. ago, and it still works great. Here are some pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros: Pretty nice 2.0 picture quality, easy transport from doc to computer, nice features, works pretty good, picture can be taken with the screen and an eye-through lens.<br /><br />Cons: Battery life not that long, battery wears out in a couple years, sometimes when the battery dies and needs to be charged you have to set the date & time again.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty nice camera, and if you're neady for one, and you find this one: GO FOR IT!!!","It's been over two years since I bought this camera and it's still going strong. After reading some of the more recent reviews I just wanted to touch on some subjects:<br /><br />Battery Life - Using 2300 mAh Ni-MH I can take over 70 top quality images, at least half with the flash on, on two batteries. During the hurricanes of 2004 that hit Florida I purchased a Lithium Ion battery cell for the camera and it's STILL in the camera and working perfectly!<br /><br />Image Quality - I'm a digital artist and know image artifacting and the differences between poor quality images and images worth printing. I've printed over a dozen 8x10s over the last two years and they've all come out beautiful. 4x6 prints that are well exposed are indistinguishable from 35mm prints.<br /><br />Imaging Speed - Yes, this, and every other point and shoot digital camera, has a slow recycle speed, some newer camera may be marginally faster but for something two years old this works as well if not better than any on the market at the time.<br /><br />In conclusion: BUY this camera if you can find one. It takes great pictures, it does NOT eat batteries as others have claimed and you can get some very nice archival prints from it. For the money I spent two years ago I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Please see my review from two years ago further down the list for more information on the Kodak CX4230.","I bought this camera on sale a couple years ago and the worst problem I have had with it is the silly KODAK policy of forcing you to use their imaging software when installing the driver.<br />This is aggravating since I have to re-install the driver every so often.  WHy can't they offer JUST the driver?<br />I now use WindowsXP's much better image retrieval system.  On my Windows2000 system the driver keeps getting lost and I end up having to reinstall it about every third use.<br />I too bought an extra memory stick (128mb) and use the camera for personal documentation and for taking gallery photos for church events to be used on their website.  I have never had any serious problem with the image quality as I always leave the camera set to best image setting.  It doesn't handle dark rooms very well, but then for $150, ... what camera would<br />I bought the docking device for an additional $50, but since the rechargable battery got to the point it wouldn't work longer than a couple of hours (the reason for my having the dockin station was the fact that it was supposed to recharge the battery) and the camera actually works faster just hooked up to the USB direct.","This is a really tough little camera and is great for vacation pictures.  I just throw it in my bag and go--I've even dropped it a few times with no loss of function.  I have blown up many of my photos to 8x10 and they still look great--even with some of the images cropped.<br />However, there are some down sides. It sucks up batteries like they're going out of style.  I had no luck with the lithium batteries that came with it and now use (ick) lots of disposables.  Also, the shutter speed is slow.  This problem can be lessened somewhat by holding down the button halfway while framing the shot, then pushing down all the way to take a picture.","Like an earlier reviewer, I feel that the shutter lag on the 4230 is very slow. I have an earlier model Kodak digital camera (3400) and couldn't be happier with it. It is very responsive and the prints are incredible. When I saw the 4230 used two fewer batteries and had a smaller form factor, I thought it would make the perfect present for my wife. Unfortunately when trying to take pictures of our kids, the delay between pushing the button and the actual capture often leave us with less than optimal results. The camera is a nice camera and the other functions work well. Perhaps I was just spoiled by their earlier model.","Does anyone know if you can buy a wide angle lense or lense adapter for this camera?","This is my first digital camera, I love it! It is very simple to use and takes better than average pictures. The price is reasonable and you really don't need to buy any anything else to take pictures or use it with your computer. It comes with easy to install software,battries, internal memory and attachment cord to download to your computer. I could not believe how easy the software was to use, to touch up pictures, email, create albums and other interesting things. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone that is new to the digital camera world.","I bought my camera in Iraq and it has been nothing but great. The small lightweight body means I can throw it in my cargo pocket or flak vest and go. I have taken it to dusty conditions, dark conditions and everything in between and it has performed. The one drawback is the slow shutter speed and the delay between the time you press down on the button and the time it takes the photo. This is something that you have to get used to on the camera. I dont have a memory card but I set my quality to good to allow the internal memory card to take 68 photos and they have been really good. The software is easy to use and for users of XP unnecessary cause XP will read direct from the camera without the software being loaded. We found this out when one of my teammates wanted to mail a photo home. A good camera, for a good price.","My parents bought my wife and I this camera as a gift when they found out their first grandchild was on the way.  We love the camera and use it often.  The software that comes with it is slick and easy to use and makes picture organization a snap.<br />Just for fun I timed how long it took for us to take pictures of our daughter, load them in the computer from the camera, reduce the size of the image (I take my pictures at the highest quality and reduce the image size in MS Paint by 50%.  File size goes from more than 600KB to usually around 60KB to 80KB) and send them in an email.  Less than 5 minutes.  Talk about happy grandparents! We are separated by over 800 miles so to get near real time baby updates can't be beat<br />The one any major draw back to the camera is the slow picture speed.  When you are trying to take a picture of a wiggling baby it can be frustrating to miss that cute pose you were shooting for.  This can be VERY frustrating.","You really can't do much better than this little camera for the money.  Great quality of shots, easy to use, self-explanatory software ... and did I mention cheap??  You can pay hundreds of dollars more, but why?  Since the medium is changing so quickly in pricing and quality, you can buy this now and not feel guilty if you want to buy a higher quality camera a year or two from now ... which will probably be as inexpensive as this Kodak is now.  So get this little gem and have fun now without having to shell out big bucks!","I got this camera as a gift.  Within 5 minutes of opening the box, I was taking photos.  It is that easy to use.  There is a delay when pressing the button, as the other reviewers have mentioned, which is fairly frustrating and makes spontaneous shots difficult.  \"Rapid-fire\" picture taking is impossible with this camera.  However, it's very easy to use and it does produce good looking photos.  It even worked on my Linux Mandrake 9.1 workstation with the included USB cable straight away without any fuss.  But I was a little dismayed at all the expensive options like the docking station.  It didn't come with an AC adapter either.  That seemed like an item that should have been included with the camera.  Kodak could've done a better job with the accessories, in my opinion.  Other than that, it's a decent low-end digital camera that is easy to use.","Unbelievable Difference Between This 2.0 MP Camera And My Previous 1.0 MP Camera.<br />I Could Not Believe The Clarity When Enlariging Photos Taken With The 4230.<br />Because Of Its 3.5 Optical Zoom Coupled With The 2x Digital Zoom, And The 2.0 MP, I Believe That This Camera Is Absolutely The Best Deal For The Money.<br />Money Well Spent!!","this camera is a little pricey including all the things you need to buy for it but it is well worth it. It is so easy and simple to use. It is worth the extra cash to go for the 3x optical zoom. So go ahead and treat yourself. All you have to do is point, click and its done!","This camera is awsome! We got a brand new computer and got this camera. I think it is great. We got the dock with it. I like the LCD on the back. After you put the camera on the dock you just push a button. Then you click Tranfer. Then you pictures are on the screen. I like the special effects of the software. Easy to use. Pictures turn out great!!! This is a great camera!!!!","This is my most fav camera. With it I can take all the wildlife pics I want. Easy to use, great pics. What more can you ask of this product?","This is my most fav camera. With it I can take all the wildlife pics I want. Easy to use, great pics. What more can you ask of this product?","This is a nifty little camera that is pretty easy to use. Pretty much just point and shoot.","This is my first digital camera - I've always been a technofan, but a thrifty one, so I waited a few years to get a little more for my money on a digital camera. Man, was it worth the wait!<br />This camera is very easy to use, and takes great pictures. The menu system is easy to navigate, and pretty intuitive. My only complaint about the menu system is that some of my settings (such as 'close up mode') aren't saved when I turn off the camera, so I have to remember to re-enable the mode when I want to use it (thus far, most of my pictures have been for auction listings, so I've needed to take lots of closeups).<br />This camera takes VERY high quality pictures.  With the 'good, better, and best' modes, I've found that 'good' works well for things like pictures embedded in online auctions, and 'best' gives me pictures that are at least as good as anything my 35mm camera produces.<br />I also purchased a 256MB SD memory card, so I basically never have to worry about running out of film or memory.<br />An unanticipated benefit of buying this camera is that I no longer have to worry when my young son begs to let him take pictures (worrying about the cost of 'wasted' film, development costs, etc).  If he takes a good picture, we keep it - if not, we delete it!<br />If you're a professional photographer needing some new equipment for your next big photo shoot, this probably isn't the camera for you.  If you want a camera with a decent zoom that will let you take hassle-free vacation shots, family shots, and other general-purpose photography, this is a great camera.<br />I would NOT invest in the optional camera dock. Even without it, all you need to do is plug your camera into a USB port and then turn the camera on - the software automatically starts, and with only one or two clicks you can download all of your pics from the camera to the PC, and delete them from the camera.","This is a great camera. It is very easy to use and includes great firmware and software. It is # 1 in my book, for the ease of use and great picture quality","If your criteria is: Ease of use, good quality pictures and optical zoom for less ... then this is the camera for you. We bought it for a family vacation and used it everyday. Surpised the original batteries are still going strong even after 75+ pics (added 32MB card), many LCD reviews, and several uploads. (I bought the Kodak charger and 4 battery pack and still haven't used it) We are waiting for the end results from Ofoto so I hope I haven't jinxed myself, but all the pictures look great on screen. Speaking of uploads, the software is very easy to install (WIN2000) and use. No need to spend the money on the docking cradle because you still do it with a push of the button within the software. Best feature: video out for slide shows on TV. Feature not avail: movie mode, but that's what video cameras are for. Summary, very happy we didn't blow our budget on a more expensive camera for features and settings we would rarely use.","I don't know what these people are talking about but I have three comp running windows xphome and xppro.  I loaded the software and it worked beautifully. As far as the camera goes, it's great but i would recommend extra batteries. I mean u can't go wrong with a Kodak camera :).",".... I've never used the Kodak software, I use a memory card reader, it's faster and doesn't use the camera batteries or rely on an expensive camera dock to transfer images to the PC. I certainly wouldn't have bought it without reading what type of memory card is uses, which ARE, ...., available from many 3rd party manufacturers and they're only moderately more expensive than other types of cards. All non-SLR digital cameras have a delay in between pressing the shutter button and the taking of the picture, the delay of this camera is no better or worse (around 1 second) than any other.<br />The few drawbacks/complaints I have about the camera are;<br />Flimsy doors, especially the door over the memory card slot, it<br />feels as if it could be easily broken if special care is not taken<br />when removing or reinserting the memory card.<br />Plastic camera body, while my AE-1 has been flung off cliffs<br />and sunk in rapids I fear that a drop from almost any height<br />would cause significant damage to this camera.<br />Poor placement of the 'camera ready/camera status' light. It's<br />right next to the optical viewfinder and can interfere with taking<br />pictures in low light situations because of it's brightness.<br />Slow shutter speed of 1/8th sec. isn't very slow. A full second<br />would have been a nice addition.<br />All in all this is a great camera for the price, it takes good<br />pictures, comes with decent features and is almost completely<br />idiot proof. It's not a professional camera but great for someone<br />who's interest in getting started with digital photography and<br />small enough to take with you anytime (I don't leave the house<br />without mine.)","I received this camera as a gift and I have not been dissapointed since. You can print large pictures (up to 15\" x 22\"), I didn't realize this at first but when I found out, I was very happy. I figure I could make wonderful posters someday. I usually print up to 8\" x 10\" with excellent results. With the right paper and injets the colors are so vibrant and beautiful and the picture quality is superb. It's very easy to use and I love the \"EasyShare\" software that comes with it. This camera allows you to view your photographs on your computer or on your televison. How cool is that? That's a great feature you'll want to use in case you go on a trip. That way, you can have fun, create your own slide show and share your photos with your friends and family. I also like the weight of the camera. It fits comfortably in your hands. So, if you want a fairly inexpensive digital camera with great results, this is the camera for you.","I bought this camera based on its price, it dependability, and the features. I will make this bold statement but this camera has the most features for its price range.<br />I will point out the good features:<br />1) decent optical zoom<br />2) good internal memory<br />3) easy to use (as soon as your open the box, it's ready to go)<br />4) decent price<br />Here are the negatives<br />1) long delay of the shutter button depress to the actualy picture being taken<br />2) slow auto focus (causes you to have to re-focus several times)<br />3) no battery charger made me buy the docking station...<br />4) poor battery life (but don't all digital cameras have that?<br />5) Too simple (creates less accuracy to environment concering pictures)","I received this camera for Christmas. The software loaded easily to both my Win2000 and WinXP computers so I have no idea why prior reviewers had problems. It takes decent pictures and is very easy to use. There is a delay when you click the button until the picture is taken... I miss a lot of spontaneous shots that way. My biggest beef is the battery charger. Mine did not come with a docking station and I was given a traveling battery charger. Much to my dismay, the lithium batteries that came with the camera do not fit the charger and the NiCad batteries that came with the charger last only a fraction of the time as the lithium. I found that the only way you can charge the lithium batteries is to buy the docking station ...! This inexpensive camera suddenly becomes very expensive.","excellent camera all around, takes great pictures. only problem was with the green ready light next to viewing window. there's too much glare when trying to frame picture especially at night. it obsures your vision. also the kodak editing program has a lot of useful features such as removing red eye, cropping etc. but when you want to print photo's its set up to use kodak photo paper.","I bought this camera with the easy share dock.  It is so easy to use and good quality pictures.  With the software any poor pictures can be corrected.  I had a Sony digital camera which was much harder to use.  This camera with the dock is made for the novice user.  I have windows ME and I ran the CD software and was downloading pictures within 5 minutes with one button to push.  Love it and will use the heck out of it.  Would advise anyone to get this and the dock.  For the money, the camera takes good pictures and with extra memory can hold lots of pictures.  I have 64 memory which holds 72 pictures plus the internal memory can hold 23 I believe.","This is a very nice camera, I thought the pictures were very clear.  Of course the main convenience is deleting pictures that you don't want.  A major problem I found  with this camera is that it's not very fast, and therefore it makes catching spontaneous moments very difficult.  For example, it is impossible to photograph my baby's cute but fleeting expressions because by the time the camera gets around to taking the shot, my son has moved on.  Lacking experience with other digital cameras, I don't know if this long lag time between hitting the button and the shutter releasing is typical of all digital cameras or just this one....  Because of this flaw, I will be returning the camera hopefully to find a faster one!","I recently bought a Kodak EasyShare CX4230 Camera and want all to know that it produces great pictures with beautiful colors and clarity.  But the best part is the EasyShare Docking Station which lets you put your pictures onto the computer so easily and fast.  My wife and I are so glad we purchased this product and recommend it hightly.","This camera is excellent in my opinion. The picture quality is more than sufficient for what I am using it for. Very easy to use, software is good, but not necessary for the more savvy person. The thing is, the on switch stopped functioning properly after 3 days of having it. It was not dropped, or roughed up or anything. It doesn't prevent operation but it is a pain in the behind.","in response to the review from the person who had toubles loading the software with Win XP O/S.  I had no problems installing and using the software on my Win XP Pro operating system.  In fact, I installed it on my desktop and laptop and it works flawlessly.  If you are running Win XP, dont let that review prevent you from purchasing this GREAT camera.","Great little camera.  I like all the features.  Lots of life in the lithium battery.  Takes great color photos and out performs cameras that cost lots more.  I recommend this product to anyone wanting a quality camera w/o spending lots of money.","I just recently left a fine review of this little Kodak camera, which is a good beginner camera with good pictures. However, after using the Kodak software for maybe the 12th time, it decides to stop working. I had to uninstall it because it would not load my albums or pictures, and when I uninstalled it, it told me that I could not use it anymore, that my connections failed. After 7 frustrating trys, I boxed the camera back up to take it back. AFter all, what good is the camera, if you can't use the software? Very Very frustrating.......","SORRY THEY DICONTIUED THIS CAMERA I HAVE BEEN BRAGING ABOUT IT SINCE I GOT IT MAY 2002 I WAS GOING TO BUY 2 AS CHRISTMASS GIFTS<br />I AM GLAD I GOT MINE.

I was shocked when I got my film back (I ordered online) and the pictures really looked good. The software included with this camera is sooo easy and emailing the pictures could not be more self explanatory. I would highly reccomend this camera, especially if you just want to take casual pictures (pics for fun, etc.). I also have the Canon Powershot G2 and highly recomend it for higher quality (EXCELLENT) pictures. Overall, this is a great beginner camera and it's a lot of fun!","I just received the camera and after three other cameras returned, I just love this one.  Picture quality is excellent and software is by far the best I have ever used.  Email could not be easer.  Just click to send.  Highly recommended.","An extremely user friendly unit with all needed features for quality pictures from closeup to infinity. Kodak website support is excellent and picture management S/W is good. Have seen better S/W but still very good.","Absolutely, under no circumstances, purchase this item from PC Nation.  Their customer service is not their priority.  The camera itself is easy to use and of good quality and found it to be worth the money.","Good value- nice options I especially like the lithium vs rechargable battery option.  This camera is cheaper than comparable models w/ simular features- IF you have a Mac and don't have to buy the useless docking station :o)","This is an excellent camera - and you can get the MMC cards from a third party, you don't have to get the Kodak brand.  I love the features that this camera has, the zoom, slide show capability, thumbnail review, marking favorites - it's so customizable - and the editing software is great too.","I purchased this camera to replace a broken point and shoot Camera.  I have been pleasantly surprised at the quality of the pictures I am able to print from my HP Inkjet printer.","great camera, little price.  CX4230 uses very affordable, widely available multimedia cards for storage and also has 16mb of internal memory!  excellent quality photos, easy software, good battery life.  Share idea is brilliant! (you take a picture, and immediately can tag it for emailing your friends...holds 32 email addresses in camera!)","It should be noted that this Kodak camera, while not using CompactFlash or SmartMedia, the \"usual\" memory cards used in digicams, uses the smaller SD/MMC format.  Those of you using the newer Palms will recognize this memory format, as it is the same memory used in the newer Palms (including the m5xx, m125, m130, and m700s)<br />BTW, I'm not a kid, I just didn't want to register."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S200 (Digital IXUS v2)","amazon_reviews":["nice product","a little too simplistic.","Ok camera. A little quirky.  Sometimes the bottons dont work when you first push them. Bought for my 7 year old. Great starter camera.","Easy to use for technophobes, takes great pictures, portable, durable.  Only issue is sometimes there is a delay in the camera that makes it hard to get one shot right after another.  I haven't found the setting to control that, and maybe there is one, but I'm not sure.  Also, it seems to take a while when pressing the button to have it flash sometimes, so if you have an active child, you may want a camera with a more sensitive button.","I purchased this camera about 5 years ago and due to its inability to take a picture in low light I only used it outdoors, and it did a great job.

Great to carry around all the time so you can take shots of whatever takes your fancy. Easy to recharge too with its handy battery recharger.","I've had this camera for a little over a year and a half now and I just love it.  It's really small, which is a huge plus.  Because of the small size, it's very convenient to take with you and that means you end up taking more pictures than you normally would.  I've chronicled most of the little and big events I have gone to with it.  Even though it's just 2 megapixels, that is more than adequate for me--I don't rely on it for professional shots, just mostly snapshots.  I have printed some photos through shutterfly, and they came out looking great.  You could tell that they weren't quite as sharp as those from a regular camera, but I had taken them at the medium compression setting.  They were definitely framable though and you probably couldn't tell that they were digicam pics unless you inspected them close up.  I suspect pics taken at superfine would be even better.  Rendition of colors is truly remarkable, and I have received many compliments from friends on this.  Canon sure does seems to know what they're doing when it comes to optics.  Any photos I've taken with bright colors (landscapes, flowers, etc.) came out breathtaking.  The camera is made of metal, so it has a nice, high quality \"heft\" to it.  The photo management software that it comes with is awesome--intuitive and easy to use.  It may run slow on old computers though, if you have a lot of photos in your albums.<br /><br />One complaint I have about the camera is that it's just okay in dark settings, even with the flash on.  Also, when taking pictures of people, I seem to get red-eye a lot, even with the red-eye reduction setting on.  It takes small video clips, but the resolution is very grainy and with the 64 MB card that I have in it, the maximum length of the clips is really short.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a terrific, dependable camera that's perfect for the beginning digicam user or for someone who wants the convenience of a small, easily transportable camera.  It comes with a far too small 8MB card, so I highly recommend getting a larger one.  Also, it doesn't come with a case, so I recommend buying one because this is a beautiful camera and you wouldn't want to damage it.  Canon makes one specifically for the PowerShot series that is leather and compact.  You can find it at Apple stores.","Excellent for traveling. Good features, not just the typical point and click type of camera. For example, you can take great pictures at night leaving the shutter open for a few seconds, some cameras don't allow more than 3 seconds. My only wish is that the battery would last longer. I had to buy a second battery.","When I purchased this camera, I was looking for something that was easy to use, and yet able to provide quality images. The S200 gave me everything I was looking for, and more. As for the reviewer below complaining about poor picture quality - you can examine each picture the second after you shoot it, and delete it if it's not a quality shot. If you choose to keep poorly shot images, rather than deleting them, that's not the camera's fault. It's yours. The menu is easy to navigate, in general. If you choose to be really technical and explore every bit of the menu, that may be a different story. I use the menu to adjust general image quality and things of that nature, and I find it to be very intuitive. One other recommendation I'd have is to purchase a larger memory card if you plan to use the camera on vacations. I bought a 256M card and that's actually overkill, but rather too much space than not enough. I also purchased an extra battery so that I could have a spare ready to go when the other is depleted. I'm sure these two extras have greatly improved my experience with this camera. I would certainly buy it again in a second. The S200 is cheap, small, and it does everything the average person who's looking for a digital camera could ask for.","I've had my S200 for two years now.  I primarily use it for outdoor, point & shoot photography, and it has been absolutely fantastic for that kind of usage.  I've made it through a couple 8-day mountaineering trips on just one battery with the LCD on 2-second preview mode.  The video clips are limited to about 10 seconds on high res. -- but that's not necessarily bad b/c long video clips can be boring. ;) The automatic exposure mode takes great pictures under normal circumstances, but as with most digital cameras it has a hard time dealing with low light. The camera is fairly limited in how you can manually improve it's performance in those situations.  You also will need to manually adjust the white balance with snow scenes as they will be a little overexposed on automatic.  Other than that, the only two reasons why I am thinking of upgrading are: 1) I want higher resolution for larger prints, and 2) a better zoom.  2x optical zoom (on any camera) is pretty worthless for getting action type shots in outdoor photography.  But with respect to resolution, I do get great 4x6 prints out of this camera, and pretty good 5x7's.  And the picture quality is wonderful.  I often get comments from people impressed with what great pictures I get out of this little camera.  If you are in the market for a compact point-&-shoot, and primarily want to get small prints, photo cards, or web images, this is a great, low-investment camera.  I bought it for $250 two years ago -- at $150, you will be very happy with it.  I recommend getting a 128mb card -- I can fit about 100 images on that size card with the camera at it's highest resolution.","I bought this camera in May 2002 and I've been very pleased with it during all this time. It takes great pictures and I've had paper copies of lots of pictures with good result. Today you get cameras with 4 or 5MP for the same prize as I bought this one back in 2002, but considering the price of this camera today you get a really good product to this prize. If you want a small and camera easy to use that gives good enough pictures for to reasonable cost this camera is definitively a good option.","Let me first qualify my rating a bit before I get into specifics:<br />1) It seems the mean for compact camera resolution currently is about 3-4 megapixels if bought brand new.  This is a 2 megapixel camera, which was the mean for a compact camera about 2 years ago (when I bought the camera).<br />2) This rating is based on 2 years of wonderful experience with this camera and thousands of pictures taken.  If you are set on a 2 megapixel camera regardless of price, then this is the camera for you.<br />-Picture Quality- Amazing for a 2 megapixel camera.  I routinely print out 4x6 pictures at great quality.  Before this camera I was using an APS Elph.  Without a doubt this camera prints much better quality pictures than my old APS compact camera.  Although keep in mind, no matter how good the camera is, the prints can only be as good as the printer.  The only problem I had with this camera is that it is VERY dependent on the flash for point and shoot pictures.  Without the flash, unless you are in bright sunlight, pictures can come out blurry if you don't have steady hands.<br />-Features- AMAZING.  Simply more features than you will use if you are buying the camera for quick snapshots.  Also the problem with the flash dependence that I mentioned earlier can be fixed using the manual features.  But with that said, it is impractical to change these features manually everytime you want to take a quick shot, but it is very handy when you want to take portrait type or studio type shots. This camera also has a movie function with sound that most cameras have nowadays.  Most people say they don't use it, but I use the function a lot.  I find the main problem is that most people just forget they have the function so it is never used, but if you can get in the habit of using it you'll have priceless small clips (at a low resolution) of things that happened.<br />A 2x optical zoom isn't too shabby either considering many compact cameras don't offer a zoom.<br />-Durability- again AMAZING.  I have never dropped this camera (well once off a bed, onto some really soft carpet), but I've owned this for 2 years and probably 75% of those two years that camera has resided in my jeans pocket with lint, keys, cell phones, change... and not even ONE scratch and it still works perfectly.  I did buy a small pouch for it, but the pouch really goes against what this camera is about, fast pictures.  It wasn't practical to take the camera out of the pouch everytime I wanted a quick picture so I never used it, and it turns out I never needed it.<br />Also the camera is heavy and solid for its size.  Too heavy for a shirt pocket, but definitely light enough to put into your pants.  Its made of a metallic material that feels much better than the plastic that most compact cameras are made of.<br />The display screen on the back of the camera is plenty big enough to use to frame your shots.  The viewfinder however does not accurately show the picture you are taking, which is a problem for many cameras.  I never use the viewfinder because of this, but I never really want to either unless I forgot to charge my battery and I want to conserve battery power... which leads me to...<br />-Battery Life-  The battery easily lasts the whole day of picture taking if you are on a vacation for instance.  Easily I would be able to take 100+ pictures with flash and the screen on.  But I have noticed over the thousands of pictures I have taken that the constant recharging of my battery has made the life lessen a bit.  But that is to be expected from any battery over a couple of years of high usage.<br />-Price and Summary- I think the deciding factor for this camera is price.  I gave this camera five stars because I couldn't be happier with my camera... BUT i bought the camera 2 years ago.  A quick look at cameras of equivalent price and one can easily find 3-4 megapixel cameras for the same price (but maybe not the same quality).  A quick look at cheaper cameras and I can also find plenty of 2 megapixel cameras from reputable brands such as Minolta, Nikon and Fuji.  This camera has kept its price amazingly well over 2 years for an electronic device (I bought mine 2 years ago for $250).  I think it has to do with the HIGH quality of this product.  But if you have the extra $$$ for a mere $100 more you can get a 4 megapixel Elph.<br />I am very satisfied with this product and I know when I eventually get a new camera several years from now it will be another Canon Elph.","i've been using my s200 for a couple of years now, and it's toured the world with me. it's been durable, convenient, and a great home and road camera. i just got back from tokyo and took hundreds of photos and several minutes of video (30 second AVIs) with it. same with france, washington dc, and the like ...<br />it's got good exposure detection, a very simple to use interface, and has the features i was looking for. the zoom is pretty good for most situations, and it's reasonably responsive (boot up time, delay between click and exposure).<br />i'm not that thrilled with the macro capabilities, my nikon coolpix 800 did much better. nor am i thrilled about the \"no zoom during movie capture\" feature.<br />overall, i'm quite happy with my s200 as a point-and-shoot camera. i'd definitely get it again if i had the choice to do over. however, now i'd probably go for a few more bells and whistles, including more optical zoom and better macro shots. still, can't beat the form factor!","This camera is very small and very durable. Due to its metal frame, it's slightly on the heavy side for its size.<br />It's the type of camera you can take with you just about anywhere. It's perfect for taking to partys and other events as it can take a real beating without getting hurt.<br />2MP is good enough for most occations, and you can make very high quality prints in the sizes you're used to for your APS and 35mm cameras.<br />The AF Assist lamp is a definite advantage, as it allows you to take pictures in relatively low light, usually indoors. It sometimes happens that it can't lock focus, but the camera will still take a picture after a short pause, and usually with a good result at that. This feature is far from perfect, but it definitely gives you an edge over cameras that lack this small, but very important feature.<br />The battery capacity is not that great. With the LCD screen on, you can perhaps get somewhere between 50-120 pictures taken, all depending on how much you're \"idling\" in between. An extra battery is a must here. I shoot most of my pictures with the LCD screen off, and on that setting, the camera will still show you the resulting picture in the LCD screen for either 2 or 10 seconds (user selectable), so it's not really a problem. With the LCD screen off, you probably about double the amount of pictures you can take, possibly more, before you have to change the battery.<br />On maximum quality settings, your pictures will usually consume between 700kb and 1.1MB of space on your memory card. I've found that most pictures end up being about 1MB.<br />I've had this camera for a year now, and so far I've had no problems at all. This has so far been a very reliable camera. I've also bought a car charger, and two additional batteries for it.<br />I would recommend buying at least one additional battery (I have a total of 3 myself), as they wear out reasonably quick, and they can not be charged internally in the camera - you have to take them out and put them in a charger.","Pros:<br />Small size!! Good quality photos for casual use. Lots of manual controls. Optical Zoom present. TV output useful.<br />Cons:<br />Heavy for it's small size. Takes some time to turn on/power up. Battery life could be better. Cheap plastic battery and memory card door cover (broke easily). Weak flash. Telephoto/wide angle trigger gets stuck with use. 8MB memory card it comes with is absolutely useless (I gave mine away).","I replaced a Kodak 65 series digital with this unit, largely to get to the more compact size and to the features, like the movie, audio and stitch-together modes.  This unit is shirt-pocket capable, a BIG advantage, plus has all the features I need for my photography.  I've taken, and filed on the computer and CD's a couple thousand pictures, with virtually no troubles or confusion regarding the controls.  8x10's are no problem with the 2 MP setting.  I'd do another one of these again in a minute, and, in fact, bought 3 more of 'em for presents to relatives.","This camera is awesome!  I've had mine for about 6 months now and I've been so happy with it.  I'm not a camera junkie or professional photographer so this is perfect in that it's small, affordable and has all the features that I'd ever need.<br />Very easy to interface with the computer to download images or the TV for easy viewing.  You'll want to get at least a 256MB card for all the pictures that you'll take with this great camera.","Tiny, easy to use and perfect make the Canon S200 2 MP Digital Elph Camera my personal favorite.  We have other, more powerful, much more expensive digital cameras, and this is the one I reach for every time.  Point, shoot, and upload to your computer.  Pictures rival the ones taken by the \"big boys,\" and requires no more dexterity than the average chimp.  (or me - take your choice.  Chimps probably have more dexterity than I do)<br />Uploading photos is a breeze.  Plug the camera into your computer with the included cable, wait a moment, and your photos are onscreen, waiting for your editing.  We use this camera with iPhoto and Photoshop for editing.<br />The metal clad camera fits perfectly into a purse or a shirt pocket, and is ready to use in a few seconds.  I'd replace it in a moment, although I hope I don't have to.<br />One caveat:  the included 8mb compact flash card is so small as to be useless.  Buy a good sized card from your favorite supplier and you'll be much happier.  I also purchased a spare battery from a third party, just in case.","nothing about this is designed badly, its just a flawless piece of machinery","The Canon Elph S200 is my 4th digital camera and I find myself using it more than higher resolution - higher end cameras.  It is so small, I can easily carry it with me wherever I go.  It's simple enough to use so I can catch my 7 year old in action.  And the resolution is good enough to create great pictures!  My next camera will be a higher resolution Elph!","I bought this expecting it to be my \"starter\" digital camera.<br />as often happens with electronics I buy something and then, through my experience, refine my concept of what I need. Normally I end up purchasing something closer to meeting my needs in a second (or third!) purchase.  Or I buy something not quite as expensive as the \"top of the line\", only later to break down and pay for the improvements/enhancements garnered by laying out the long green.<br />I may have proven those theories wrong with this purchase.  frankly, I can find no major faults with this camera.<br />I have taking photos since boyhood and have owned quite high-end 35mm cameras from Nikon and Canon.  I am demanding in image quality.  This camera has fulfilled all my expectations and more from a digital camera.  BTW 2 megapixels is more than enough if you use the highest quality setting on the camera and do not plan to enlarge your photos to larger than 8X10\"...but who does?  the color rendering is also spot on.  the metering takes a bit of study (of the manual) and practice to get the right results under tough lighting condition but once you do master that you can get really great results.<br />the only limitation I find with this camera is the zoom.  too little optical zoom range for my tastes and the digital zoom results in reduced image quality. BUT HEY this is for trips, etc. not for professional results, I guess I was spoiled by all my telephoto lenses on my 35mm cameras, I have gladly left all of that bulky equipment in the closet now.<br />Rugged construction and nice to look at.  great photos and low-ish pricing.  what's not to love.  I think you will not be disappointed by this camera.","This is simply worth the money, its features are awesome, you can't get a camera which is digital 2.x megapixels with video and recording capabilities with sound and preview window, self timer, sound and pictures themes and best of all its features it is compact and fits in your pocket ... this camera should be called Pocket Cameras... instead of digital cameras..<br />The best option you can try is stich photos i recently went to DC and took the landscaping photos and merged it and my friends say one word \"Wow\" .... you need not be a expert photographer u just need to have cool tool to do it ....<br />Don't think twice just buy this when u have good offer and you can't beat Amazon's prices along with 64MB flash card free and shipping free .... Ordered 2 cameras for my cousins....","it's small enough to fit in your pocket. basic functions meet point-n-shoot needs. if you're looking for your first digi-cam, this is it.","I bought this a year back, and take it everywhere. It easily slips into the pocket. Takes great photos. The only rawback is that it has only 2x optical zoom. Anyway most digital cameras have this much only. Dont forget to buy more memory when you buy this camera. It comes with a 8M memory, which can hold only 10 photos of high resolution.","This is the best digital camera in the world.... there is nothing i can say about it because it is one of the most practical digital cameras.... i have been using it for two years and the pics are fabulous...............","I have other digital cameras with higher pixel count but I bought the Canon primarily because of its size.  I am very pleased with the camera, although I think a 3 zoom would have added much more to its value instead of the 2 zoom. I just took an extended car trip through the northwest and carried the camera in my back pants pocket very comfortably.","I needed to upgrade to a better digital camera and carefully did my homework.  The Canon S200 consistently received excellent reviews on numerous sites with many positive comments on compactness, picture quality, and overall design.  Of course there was always the ocassional negative review from someone who got the rare lemon but the majority rules. This is a great point and shoot camera with a crisp view screen. It also gives you the ability to tinker with plenty of the settings including shutter speed. It does an outstanding job with two mega pixels, any more for me would be overkill.  I have taken photos in numerous lighting situations and it has done a good job in all of them, including a gorgeous macro shot of a flower. I purchased the leather S200 Power Shot case that fastens to your belt and you would never know it's there, it can't get any easier.  With a 128mb card in the camera and an extra battery in my pocket I'm ready for anything.  The movie mode with sound works great and is easy to send by email(great for new baby clips, etc.). There are three resolution settings for the movie mode: 4,10, and 30 seconds in length with the 10 second setting being my favorite. I have read complaints on the duration of the movie but for email it's plenty long enough unless you like huge uploads and your family and friends like huge downloads. Try holding a camera on most people for 10 seconds asking them to say something and it seems like an eternity.  A nifty charger is included which is very compact with it's own pop out plug, just plug it in to the outlet like a glade air freshener and wait for the light to turn green. I have noted some complaints that the camera doesn't warn you of low battery soon enough, how much time do you need?  When the indicator comes on you have a few shots left but why push the envelope, just swap batteries.  When is the last time your car warned you of an up coming dead battery?, at least the S200 doesn't leave you stranded and the battery is so small you wouldn't even know there is an extra in your pocket. The S200 will plug in to your TV and do an awesome slide show of any or all of the pictures and movies contained in it.  It shows a few pictures, automatically plays a movie, then shows more pictures and continues this in whatever order you choose with a staggering amount of pictures and movie clips using a 128mb card. I am more than satisfied with my purchase and hope I have provided you with another interesting angle on this camera. Four stars is excellent, Five stars is perfect?","This camera is great. It takes great pictures, is very easy to use, and fits into my smallest purses! I am not a big time photographer, but this camera does the job. I bought the cannon i-850 (i think) printer and i swear you can't tell the difference between the pictures I print and the pics you get from the store. I highly reccomend this camera to anyone who is interested in a digital camera without all the bells and whistles!","There are way too many cameras in this category that you could spend months researching them all and you'll probably still be unsure that you made the right choice. The S200 was one of my picks and the fact the my brother has the older S300 and really likes it made my decision to get the S200 easier. Amazon also has the best price when you include the free shipping. I bought this along with the Viking 128 MB card. Below are the pluses and minuses that I've classified thus far:<br />+ Compact size and solid Japanese construction<br />+ Featured-packed with many manually adjustable features that I don't plan on ever using<br />+ Comes with rechargeable lithium ion battery and charger (this will save you around $50)<br />+ Records video and audio and has A/V outputs so you can plug it directly into your TV to view the pics and video<br />+ Nice packaging and excellent documentation - you get the actual paper manuals, not PDF files on CD. Everything in the box is well layed out<br />+ Sharp LCD screen<br />+ Excellent picture quality<br />- Lack of a case or protective cover of any kind<br />- Flimsy terminal cover on camera<br />- Pathetically small 8 MB CF card that was included<br />- Unlike some other brands, namely Olympus, your PC will not recognize the camera as a mass storage device, so depending on your version of Windows, you'll need to either install Canon's software and/or drivers. I personally don't like installing software on my PC just to be able to download the pics off the cameral. I'm not into touching up pictures, so all I want to do is plug the camera in and drag the JPG files from the camera to my PC's hard drive without going through some custom program; you cannot do that with this camera unless you have Windows XP or ME, according to the manual.<br />Things you should get along with the camera are: a case, larger capacity CF card, and a CF card reader so you don't wear down the camera downloading pics to your PC. I don't think an extra battery is something that you should get right off the bat because it's expensive and, unless you plan to take pics all day, would not be necessary. The included battery should be adequate as long as you're not using the flash and LCD with every pic. If you do plan to get a battery, I've learned from postings elsewhere that you need to make sure that the battery has the same V and mAh ratings as the stock battery. The third party batteries might state that they are compatible, which is entirely true, but they have lower power ratings than the original Canon battery. You'll be able to use them, but they will not last as long as the original Canon battery.<br />Overall, I think I made the right decision with this one. It's not the best camera out there, but for $, I doubt you'll find anything of this quality that comes with rechargeable batteries and charger. Most pics that I've taken came out fine. Some pics with flash look grainy while others with flash look great - I'll have to take more pics and experiment.","I bought mine over a year ago after spending weeks looking at different brands, features and megapixels.  What sold me on this Canon S200 was the quality of the pictures, the built in features ( flash, zoom, rechargable lithium-ion battery), the reliabity of the camera based on previous owners reviews, the portability or its small size, and the fact that Canon used a metal enclosure when most of the other cameras did not.<br />So my reviews after a year of using it is as follows:  The camera is great, the lense allows for clear, sharp pictures. Even 8 x 10's look great. The computer software is very good and easy to use. This camera is also very reliable. I have used it for over a year with no problems at all. Also, I have dropped the camera accidently twice. Once on a hardwood floor from a height of about four feet and the hinge hook on the inside of the door for the memory card broke. I used a piece of transparent tape to hold the door to keep it closed and then ordered the replacement door on the phone for $8 directly from Canon. That drop did not effect the camera at all otherwise.  Then recently the camera accidently dropped out of my aftermarket velcro belt case from about three feet up onto solid concrete. It landed on a corner with a solid \"thump\" and the lithium battery popped out.  I was sure the camera had to be damaged !  I picked it up and the outside metal case didn't even have a dent in it, only a tiny scratch on the corner where it landed against the ground. I put the battery back in and turned on the camera and to my surprise everything worked perfectly. This seemed impossible to me but I took a few pictures checked the lense and its motors. The pictures were all there in memory without a glitch. A three foot drop onto solid concrete and nothing but a tiny scratch ?<br />Hats off to Canon for making one durable little camera.  I don't know what metal they used to encase this thing but after my two accidental drops I would not recommend anyone buying one of these expensive digital cameras without a sturdy metal casing.  I do not recommend doing this but I have also read several other reviews people accidently dropping this camera into water without effecting it. These Canon Powershots cost more than many others with similar specifications but the others are not as durable nor do they all have the same quality lensing.  You get what you pay for and Canon one of the first into this digital market and they know how to build them with the best enginneering and materials. I highly recommend this or any of the Canon Powershot \"S\" series digital elph cameras.","I used to own an s100, and my decision to get an s200 was based on the great service I got while using the s100.  The size is a factor, cause I like to travel light and not bulky.  The pictures are great and easy to take, just point and click.  I will be a Canon customer for a long time most likely.  I dont give it 5 stars only because I couldn't tell how to turn the flash off and instruction booklet was not handy, but I needed the shots.  It was a one-time chance for shots in an old ante-bellum home on a tour where we could not use flash, but they only told us after starting the tour!  So I tried to figure it out using the LCD menu but it's just to complicated to turn off flash.  It should be duh-duh simple for users like me.  So I had to miss a lot of interior shots.","Small and Super Sassy is the best way to explain this camera. The size is the best thing about it. I can put it in my pocket and take it anywhere. It takes great pictures for a 2.0 MP camera. I used Ofoto to get the pictures printed on kodak paper and you can't tell they are digital pictures. The only downfalls are the 8MB memory card they provide you with and getting used to the life of the lithium battery. Amazon helps with one of these downfalls by providing you with a free 64MB memory card that makes all the difference. All I want to add now is a carry case and few spare memory cards. I highly recommend this to someone looking to buy their first digital camera.","i got this camera by word of mouth, and i would definitely want to spread the word to you guys!!!  This camera is worth the investment.  2Mpixels is good enough for developing photos 4x6 max.. anything bigger becomes blurry.. great BUY!!!  and after that i put my photos on ofoto.com  .. it's a free service by kodak films..","Hey i bought this camera because of the other reviews but it did not live up to its hype or its price!<br />  The cons of it are:<br />-Terrible shots at night (when it needs flash)<br />  If you want to go to nightclubs and take shots, or take shots at night, you are limited to 6feet distance.<br />  The good cameras for night shots are the Nikons and Olympus.<br />-The video mode will only goes to 30 seconds maximum.<br />  It should go to as long as the memory card allows, but it doesnt.<br />  For that feature get the Canon A60.<br />-Only 2x Optical zoom, digital zoom should not be used with any camera.<br />-The picture quality is not as good as it should be at the lower pixels levels such as 800x600.<br />  But a plus is when you shoot at higher pixel levels.<br />  But at that level all digital cameras shine.<br />But on the positive side:<br />+Small(its really compact)!!!!<br />  I take it everywhere.<br />  I took it to me when i go places where i 'should not' be going, and it was so small i had no problem taking it out, shooting a picture, and putting it away in my pocket (pant pocket, or jacket pocket, or even shirt pocket) and no one was the wiser.<br />  Its really useful when shoping and i need to take pictures in the store of merchandise.<br />  Most stores(especially Frys, Walmart, etc) dont allow that but its so small the stores dont even notice.<br />  All in all for the price premium, if you can wait till better small cameras come out, or if you have to buy a compact camera now, this is an average quality compact camera.<br />  For a good compact camera go for Nikon, they have better night time flash, then i would recommend Olympus, then the new 'Pentax Optio S 3.2MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom.'","I purchased both a<br />Minolta Dimage F100<br />and this Canon S200 for work.<br />We compared the two as close to Apples-to-Apples as we could.<br />The Minolta has a little more optical zoom (3x) and more mega pixels (3Meg) as opposed to the Canon 2x optical zoom and 2Mega pixels.  Comparing similar photos though, the Canon holds its own.  The Canon is also easier to use - the Minolta had better internal software for setup, etc, but that didn't help that much.<br />This Canon is a bit smaller than the Minolta, a nice easy fit in a pants or shirt pocket. It's kind-of heavy for it's size, but it seems well built.  The lens motor is louder on the Canon and the LCD screen appears a little rough, but none of that matters to the end resulting photos.<br />The battery life was pretty good (all digital cameras now-a-days seem to eat batteries) - the Minolta went through batteries at a ridiculous rate, that's the killing factor on that Minolta for me.<br />Overall, this Canon S200 was a good purchase.  Good quality photos for a 2x optical zoom and 2Mega pixel camera.<br />PS<br />A nice feature on playback is the Histogram telling you how the light exposure is for the photo.<br />PPS<br />The only thing I might wish for is 3x optical zoom, but I'm not willing to pay another 100+ bucks for it.","Small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, and easy enough for a complete technophobe, this little camera packs a lot of features into a very sleek, compact package.  Photos taken with this are crystal clear and look as nice as the ones I've taken with another digital camera that was 4X the price.  Battery life is limited, so purchasing an extra to keep on the charger is a must.<br />The camera seems rugged enough to handle everyday wear without breaking, although a protective case would have been a nice addition.  Canon, you got it almost 100% right with this little guy.","Small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, and easy enough for a complete technophobe, this little camera packs a lot of features into a very sleek, compact package.

Using the macro feaure I can capture hundreds of text pages and either display them on my computer later or print them out with excellent clarity.  I can capture white-boards full of designs and concepts and review them at my leisure.  I use it to photograph parts and assemblies and get good detail.  I also use it to build relationships by photographing my contacts in other organziations and e-mailing the photos to them.  They really like that.<br />It's small enough to keep with me.  It's rugged enough to take the beating of constant travel.  What's more, it's a great piece of equipment.  It just feels good.  I'm delighted by it each time I use it.<br />It's good in low-light.  It can catch just about anything I can see.  I usually find I get a better picture avaliable-light that with the flash anyway.<br />Downside - you will not take action pictures with this camera.  There is a delay of almost a second from the time you press the button until it actually snaps the picture.  But that's not how I use it.","I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point. Well wait no more!<br />This Camera is just plain FUN. I have had it for 5 months and barely a day has gone by that I haven't used it. It really changes the way you approach photography since you can edit on the fly, the instant feedback helps you shoot till you get it right! Trial and error - the best way. Tip - after shooting an image hold the shutter button down and the image will show in the LCD screen<br />It's very well suited to people with a medium level of computer skills (perfect for Mac users)<br />The photo stitch feature is awesome letting you seamlessly join panoramic pics together with supplied software.<br />I recommend the following accessories:<br />1. Extra compact flash card, as large as you can afford, I got the Viking 128 MB<br />2. Extra battery, although the supplied pack is pretty good once it runs out you need a back up. (Get the elph Kit which includes a nice case and a really cool strap for not much more than a single battery)<br />3. If you plan on using the camera with more than one computer (like home and office) get an extra USB connector so you don't have to bring it with you every time.<br />4. Compact flash reader - I got one of these thanks to other reviewers although I don't use it much. You can upload 50 hi-res pictures in a few minutes with the supplied \"image browser\" software. It is a good battery saver but with a spare it doesn't matter anyway.<br />I'm still waiting for the perfect printer, everythhing is SO big and UGLY! but I guess if I wait long enough...........","This camera works exactly as expected. Price-functionality ratio is perfect. The 2X optical/3X digital zoom is enough for working or with-the-family trips. If you are traveling with your laptop and-or the family's typical pile of bags, you will love to place it anywhere, including you shirt pocket (do not bend), without sacrificing pixel resolution (OK...2 megapixels are not too much nowadays, but is enough on these kind of voyages) However, be aware that standard battery is not eternal. You can solve this problem playing with the LCD on/off or buying a high-capacity battery and adding up muscles enough for longer trips, or too much to see. A greater MB compact flash card doesn't hurt too.","I beg to differ with all the raving reviews.  There is something very wrong either with this camera's light metering in `auto' mode or its ability to register a wide range of tones - or both. It will work acceptably in diffused light, i.e. with an overcast sky.  But try to shoot people in bright sunlight and you get pictures that are far too contrasty: Eyebrows, nose and chin shadows come out far too pronounced. Things are worse if there is a somewhat light background, like lots of blue sky or any non-dark wall.  The system goes bezerk and yields pictures where the background is `burned out' while your darling spouse is a dark silhouette. The same happens if your son happens to wear a white T-shirt and you attempt to shoot a waist-up portrait: his face will come out underexposed.<br />There are ways to overcome such problems (to a degree!): Switch to manual mode. But who really buys a point-and-shoot camera to fiddle with manual settings? If to get acceptable pictures I have to exercise `creative control' I might as well stick to my old Minolta Maxxum. The result will not only be acceptable but PERFECT pictures.<br />But back to the S200 Elph. Another criticism is that parallax correction is way out: Unless you're shooting landscapes there's very little in common between what you see through the viewfinder and what the lens sees. Of course you can always discard that and compose through the camera's small LCD back panel - but try seeing anything clearly there in sunlight!<br />Two minor negative points concern the flash (you get more `red eye' pictures than usual in point-and-shoot cameras) and the Elph's accompanying software. This is annoyingly basic. As an example, if you `correct' a picture's contrast (or colour or brightness) and save it over the original you lose all camera settings data (including date/time of shooting).<br />Much has been said about the Elph's features. It is certainly impressive that so many are crammed in a camera this small. I am, however, unimpressed with the result. Any film-camera in the S200 Elph's price range will yield vastly superior pictures in auto-mode. All the features in the world cannot hide that.","This is an excellent value in a digital camera. I bought one after admiring a friend's, and then bought another one to give to my daughter for her  birthday. After years of owning high quality film cameras, I am impressed with the S200's excellent optics. For prints up to 8 x 10\", you're in great shape. But, what I like almost as much is the camera's diminutive size and wonderful portability. You can stick it in your pocket and take it anywhere. Because of that, you'll tend to shoot more pics. So, be sure and buy at least a 64 mb flash card, because the 8 and 16 mb cards are far too small.","Purchased this last year for around $325 or so.  This is a great little camera, fits neatly in the palm and is fairly easy to get used to.  Pictures are superb, for the price is a great camera, no plastic, all metal body.  I have a 35mm Minolta that I left home for my recent trip to Maui and have no regrets.  This is a great camera for a non professional","I purchased this camera for a trip to the UK.  It is my first digital camera and for the $ the features are fantastic!  Although I did purchase an extra battery, I did not have any problems during my 10 day trip.  The quality of pictures is fantastic and even in lower light this camera performs.<br />Granted I am not the most well-versed digital camera owner.  I am learning as I go and, for a beginner, this is the perfect camera.  Each feature is easily attainable in the manual and there is no confusion when trying something new with your camera.  So buy it, enjoy it, and spread the word.  This is an excellent digital camera with superior features and quality for the $!","Easy to use & wonderful picture quality.","This is a great first digital camera-- but I wish someone would have warned me that you should only use this camera outdoors.  I can't for the life of me get autoflash to work and I can't make the flash go on by choice to take pictures.  Beautiful outdoor pictures- woudl love to use it indoors- but even in broad daylight in the house the pictures come out dark and I end modifying them with software--If you are planning to buy this camera- beware that indoor pics don't turn out so great- my disposable camera does a better job.","This camera is tiny, but has everything.  I highly recommend it.<br />A great feature is the video clips. You can take short video (*.avi) clips as if you were taking a photo.  So you have instant short movie clips that you can view, or email.","My parents have this camera. It is light, small and packed with more features than I could ever use. Wow!","Sure, there are more sophisticated cameras with higher resolution, but if you are looking for a great value in a mid-range digital - this is it.  Excellent build quality, compact and easy to use, stylish, convenient and with more features than most casual users will ever use, this is one super camera.  Complaints are few: Batteries are proprietary and pricy (though quite long-lived), only 2x zoom - that's about it.  The optional leather case with belt loop is a nice addition. With a 128Mb card you can capture 120+ hi-res images and an amazing over 1400 at low-res!  I can fit the camera, extra battery, battery charger, cables and PCMCIA card reader in a case about the size of a paperback book.  Highly recommended product!","Wow, I have searched for a quality digital camera and found one.<br />It's only 2 megapixels, but it is more than adequate. The pictures I took were all great, the close up shots for detail shots are incredible perfect color and lighting everytime. I had a hard time between this one and a Canon A60. I had a Sony before this one and this one beats hands down. The Canon A60 has alot more features but a higher price tag. I got this one at my local Staples for $ 220.00 - BRAND NEW !!!!<br />The case is small and sturdy stainless steel. Great pocket camera. It is not a pro camera, and not a basic point and shoot, it can record up to 1 minute with audio!!! It has a microphone!!!<br />Bottom line it is a great buy and quality is excellent. I even took a picture with just a candle lit and it calibrated for light for a great shot!!!<br />Why 4 stars, well the buttons are tiny, bigger hands will have a hard time with this camera, and a replacement battery is very expensive; although do a search on Ebay and many vendors have the battery for $10-15.00; as opposed to $50-60.00 on retail sites. As for memory cards go to Crucial.com for the cheapest memory anywhere!!! I got a 128 card for $25.00 !!! There prices do change.<br />Pros: Compact and light, simple menu, easy to shoot, stainless steel case, cheap memory, movie mode, great shots, even in the dark!!!!<br />Cons: Special cable for video(included) and USB, so don't lose them or you'll have to order direct from Canon; special battery- not AA's, too small for bigger hands.<br />Final say: Great for trips, and to carry in your pocket, but if you have bigger hands and a few extra dollars, go with a Canon A60. The Canon A60 uses AA's and it's case is bigger(although plastic), and has a few more advanced features.","Wow, I was out shopping for a digital camera. I wanted something simple and small. This came out to have alot of bells and whistles.That is the best value you will find for this camera new!!! I almost picked up the Canon A60 with the 3 minute digital recording with sound, but I just wanted wanted something for snapshots with a few features. The s200 has digital recording with sound too!!! It is compact lightweight but there is a slight learning curve to it. Once you figure it out and use the software, you will be amazed at the photos you will take. I was even able to print a beautiful 8 by 10 on this thing.<br />Pros: Great value at Staples, great zoom for the price, Canon optics, recording with sound, light sensor feature. Extremely light, compact, nice menu, comes with all cables to view on tv and computer!!<br />Cons: Maybe too small for bigger hands, doesn't use AA batteries, it requires a special nicad battery that comes with it(the charger comes with it too).<br />Recommendations: I like this camera because it is a step up from my Sony. This is a great camera for the intermediate camera user-lots of features and good quality. For the Pro's, the A60 is a more expensive but somewhat better camera. The A60 has a better zoom, uses AA's, longer recording time with sound, but it is bigger, heavier and more expensive.","Absolutely love this camera.<br />For a potential buyer, it is more important to read negative reviews, rather that the ones where people write stuff to feel better about themselves.<br />So, what is not perfect about S200:<br />-quite expensive extra battery, though very long lasting<br />-weak flash<br />-tripod mount not centred (hard to get the accurate position with small tripods)<br />-software (not pretty, not functional, at least for me)<br />-expensive accesories (like waterproof case, but at least there is one)","I used a friend's S200 prior to purchasing my own camera.  Although I decided to buy the S230 for the extra megapixels (3.2 versus the 2.1 of the S200) I was very impressed with the S200.  If you do not intend to make many 8x10 enlargements and none larger than 8x10 and you have a budget this is a great little camera.  The pictures at 4x6 size are as good as the S230.  The video clips are adequate and have sound.  Most important this camera boasts the same small size, easy to use dials, sturdy metal case and quality workmanship and design as its more expensive sibling.<br />The drawbacks of this camera are the:<br />  1. There is a very minimal(2x) zoom.<br />  2. There is not any warning before you run out of memory on your compact flash card.<br />  3. There is insufficient warning before you run out of power.<br />  4. There is an appearance of red eye in many indoor photos.<br />These problems can be remedied by always starting out with adequate memory on your card, charging your battery before each use, carrying an additional battery and CF card, and turning off the flash whenever there is adequate light available.  This is often the case even indoors.  As for the zoom get closer. Do not use the digital zoom as picture quality suffers.<br />I have discovered that by taking these precautions I've been very satisfied with both the S200 and the S230.  They are both so easy to use and to carry on even vigorous outings as they easily fit in a small pocket.  The case has protected my camera from intense humidity and a fall onto concrete.  All in all I'm very satisfied.","I was desperate for a digital camera of my own, and found this one.  I compared it with many others, even though this was only 2.0 MegaPixels, low for today's standards of a 5.0 and above, it was just right for me.  I loved the design, it was a bit heavy, but small for my style.  It's perfect for someone who just wants to take fun photos, though I only recommend this for simple photos.  It's great when on the computer as tested.  I don't regret purchasing it at all for it's promising price.","Before digital cameras I used to carry a Olympus XA with me almost everywhere.  When at work I carried it in my briefcase, when going out with friends it fit in my pocket, when backpacking or cycling it is as small as a pack of cigarettes with its detachable flash removed.  I took it everywhere for years.  I wanted something similar in a digital camera: small, rugged, and takes good pictures.<br />Enter the Canon Digital Elph S200.  While small it is heavy for its size giving the impression of quality and durability.  I still have a lot of 35mm gear but face it; most of the time you are shooting snapshots that won't be enlarged above 4x6\".  2 Megapixel looks just dandy on 4x6\" prints even if you end up cropping.  When I'm shooting something I plan on blowing up I'll use my 35mm or even medium format gear; the rest of the time I use my little Canon.  I purchased a 128MB CF card which holds enough shots for entire vacations.<br />The one drawback to this camera is the time it takes to autofocus a shot.  There are times when I'm trying to snap a picture when the camera \"thinks\" for as much as 10 seconds before firing.  You can minimize this by pre-focusing the camera before taking the shot but this is not a good camers to try to grab a quick shot.<br />A month after I got my Elph S200 the Elph S230 came out.  The S230 also has a 2x optical zoom but 3.2MP resolution.  The S230 is also about $100 more expensive and an inch or so bigger.  This would be a camera to consider if you want a little more resolution for larger prints and don't mind it being a tad bigger.<br />Except for the slow autofocus speed I'm thrilled with the Canon S200.","This is a real good camera, but there are butter choices than this. I would consider Canon PowerShot A60 is much better choice than this. It has all the features this one has + it has more optical as well as digital zoon + it's cheaper + we can record video upto 3 min. (it's max. 30 sec. in S200)<br />Also playback on LCD has sound in A60, which is not present in S200.<br />Although disadv. of A60 are bigger size (not that much), it uses AA size batteries, I always prefer Lithium Ion Rechargeable batteries. and it is not yet released ;-)","I bought my camera about 8 months ago and it has travelled to  about 7 countries since! The size is perfect to travel with and the pictures come out great-even in bad light, with the light compensation feature of course. All other problems can be corrected using the Canon Zoombrowser software.<br />I only wish I could find the right cover/bag for it. For whatever reason it isn't available in the US; when I found one in Europe it was priced at 38 Euro!","The other reviews have said enough about the cool features and good image quality of this entry-level digital camera.  I just want to emphasize its excellent quality.  My family has a total of three digital cameras by Canon and also a Rebel SLR bought years ago, and all exhibit the highest level of quality control. You can't go wrong with a Canon.","In  a nutshell, this seems to be great little camera.  It's tiny, solid, and delivers very good quality pictures.  At its \"best\" settings, the camera delivers more (yes, more) pictures on a single 128meg memory card than the 128 estimated pictures.  My file sizes hover around the 800k mark--less than the 957 estimated--a good thing.<br />The battery (NB-1LH) however scores only about half of the estimated pictures at this quality.  At around 80 photos, it starts screaming for more juice.  A backup battery is recommended.  Still better than some other highly rated cameras, just not what I hoped for.<br />Low light conditions are a bit of a challenge sometimes for the camera, so a mini tripod or a monopod are also useful.<br />Finding a case for it was difficult as well.  A small cell phone belt loop thing works best for me, though no extra storage for stuff.<br />Sooo, great for the non-professional. Great for the outdoors. Great for the active folk with its small and friendly package.  Buy the larger memory cards, an extra battery, and hunt for that perfect case.  I do love the camera for it's pocketability and its ease of dumping photos to my PC, or directly to a TV screen, as it has a slide show mode that you could record directly to VHS if you were so inclined.<br />Buy it, you know you want to.","Pros<br />This camera is excellent for college students, its relatively cheap, compact and takes good quality photos. The other plus of this camera is that it can take short video clips with sound, so it's definetely an advantage. I would recommend to buy spare batteries and a 128mb compact flash card.<br />Cons<br />The  downside to this camera is that you cant tell when your battery is gonna die as there is no battery indicator until towards the end when the battery beeps 10 times and then the camera shuts down.<br />Pictures taken Indoor are of low quality, even with flash button on. Most pictures taken indoors are dark and dimm.<br />However, i still recommend this camera to anyone who wants to have a great time snapping photos.","...This camera rules.  It's a lot of fun, easy to use, and takes great pictures.<br />What is important to know, however, is that today.. 3 days into camera ownership.. I dropped her.  From about 6 feet up.. onto asphalt.  And it didn't break.. nor has anything weird happened.  It's a little banged up, but this metal shell protects.. and if you drop stuff like I do, three days after buying the darn thing.... then you probably should get this.n over a week.)<br />I recommend getting a carrying case (not included) and a 256 Mb memory card.  For Amazon.com's low price, it's worth the extra few bucks to be able to take 400+ hi-res pictures between downloads to the computer.<br />Also, to save batteries, I'd recommend leaving the LCD display turned off (hit the DISP button twice) when in picture-shooting mode.  Just use the optical viewfinder instead of the LCD when you're taking the picture.  (You can still see the picture for several seconds on the LCD after you take it.)  If you keep the LCD on, the battery goes in a few hours.  Unfortunately, there is no \"low battery\" warning.","My husband gave me this camera for Christmas, and so far I am thrilled.  This is my first digital camera.  I  have carried a Nikon SLR and moved to an Olympus Stylus for point and shoot several years ago.  I am a trained amateur photographer in 35 mm, but really wanted to move to digital.  I'm picky about clarity and light quality.  However, I particularly wanted a small compact that I could carry around all the time.  Last year I purchased the Canon Elph advantix camera for my daughter, and watching the great quality of that camera coupled with the tiny size, Canon has totally won me over.  This camera is very easy to use and the photos are easy to download.  The software is very user friendly and so is the camera.  I am not one to read manuals, so I just started working with it and have had no problems doing everything I want to do.  I recommend if you buy this camera that you buy several memory cards and at least one battery backup.  The battery it comes with lasts about 2 hours when used for active shooting, but turned off in between.  The memory card it comes with holds about 12 photos.  FYI - purchasing these accessories on-line will save you lots of money - in stores the memory cards are double the price.  I carry the little Elph in my purse, and it has really come in handy.  We use a digital camera for headshots at my work (it was an older Sony) and it broke.  My little Elph saved the day!  My only criticism - I wish the camera had more zoom.  I will probably upgrade even further next time, now that I know what is possible from this little camera.","I compared the S200 to a few other digital cameras under a variety of conditions, indoors and out.  The S200 was a winner with respects to size and weight, and took decent photos when lighting conditions were optimal.  Wide angle performance of the S200 was the worst of the 4 cameras compared (Sony F710, Olympus C-50, Kodak 260).  The poor wide angle performance may be due to the tiny optics, the small CCD size, or both.  In optimal light, the S200 did a credible job for a 2 mb image size, but lacked the color saturation and contrast of even the Kodak 260, the oldest technology in the test.  The Olympus C-50 is about 20% larger physically, has more than double the pixels and costs about twice as much, but outperforms the S200 in virtually every category, particularly indoors when a flash is needed.  The coverage of the S200 flash is simply inadequate for most shots.","I just got this camera and it's awesome! My old digicam, a Kodak DC290, was decent but way too bulky to fit in my pocket and the S200 does this perfectly (figure it is about as long as your index finger and tall as your thumb and deep as half your pinky; aprox of course).<br />Image Quality: I must admit the image quality is slightly better on the DC290 but the S200 fits my needs great -- i'm no camera pro.<br />Battery life: I did my own testing and the battery (840mAh) it comes with lasts about 2 hours with the LCD on and taking pictures--the unit gets warm when left on the whole time i was draining it. (My DC290 lasted maybe 5-10 minutes or after a dozen shots, yuck!). The best thing about this is that it uses Li-Ion and the battery is light... Anyone complaining about battery life should definatly get more cells--cheap and last about 2hrs each. (note: my 2hr test was on the first charge so maybe later charges will last even longer)<br />Another feature i really like is the movie capability (only 30seconds max though). 30sec movies is about 3.5MB in size using QuickTime codec.<br />Overall this camera is really great. It's sooooo much better than the DC290--I can actually take many many pictures before replacing the battery w/ the LCD on.","This camera is a cutie, and takes great outdoors pictures on automatic mode.  One trick I found to get good all-around pictures is to put it on manual mode with \"flash-enabled\" at all times.  This gives you good pictures indoors as well as outdoors in most situations, especially backlit ones.  Also, pictures with the flash have less shadows on the faces.<br />On my recent vacation I used the Canon s200 almost exclusively since it is so portable. You can slip it in your pocket and have it ready in no time. Besides, it is unobstrusive, and you don't go around looking like a tourist with a big bulky bag.<br />You can also print out pictures with the Canon CP-100 Digital Printer, which is a small portable dye-sublimination printer (not inkjet, so it won't smudge).  It's a great combo to take on vacation or to a party since you can print out pictures right there and share with friends and relatives.<br />Another neat feature is the stitch-assist mode.  You take a series of pictures, by looking through the LCD, it'll show your previous picture half-way and helps you to line up the image.  You can then import this sequence into the Photostitch software provided and get an instant panoramic.  The Canon Photo Browser software remembers which set of pictures were shot in a series, and the transfer and stitching is very easy and automatic with a few clicks.  This feature is great for vacationers and real estate agents, and adds to the fun of using this camera.  The resulting image is likely to be huge, but using any photo editing software you can reduce the size for web-pages (set the width to 800 pixels) and create some really awesome vacation web pages.<br />Another fun feature is the movie clips you can take.  It's very simple to use.  Just slide it to movie mode, push once on the shutter-release to start taking the movie, and once to end it.  Surprisingly it even records sound, so you can get the kids to say Happy Birthday to their grandma and send it to her via e-mail.<br />For convenient show and tell, Canon includes a cord that allows you to connect the camera to a TV (and there is both a video and an audio cable - for the sound in the avi (movie) mode).","An excellent digital camera, great price, less than $300; very compact, fits in your pocket. A lot of features, support images with 1600x1200 resolution. I only recommed to buy an additional Compactflash Card because 8 MB its only for 7 high resolution pictures. 128 MB CF I recommend.","I bought this camera when it first hit the market. I have been a Canon fan since the late 60's, and although I have used pretty much every film format except 8x10, I have found that the smallest cameras were the ones that were at hand most often. My old Canon G17QL was my first \"small\" camera with a quality lens, and it still takes good images after 25 years or so. When the Elph APS series came out, I bought one, and I was hooked. It offered far more than the typical point and shoot camera of the day, and sported a great lens protection system, as well as an armored metal body. I carried it in my pocket for several years, and it always gave great results. The only problem was the continuing expense of film. I dreamed of the day when digital technology caught up with film.<br />The wait is over. The S-200 has the diminutive size of the APS Elph cameras, as well as the pocket proof lens protection. It is also all but bulletproof with it's tough stainles steel body. This camera is loaded with quality features. With a 128 meg memory card...it is ready to take 128 gorgeous max resolution pics. The color, exposure, and overall quality of the pictures will amaze you. Even the short movie clips the camera can take are of high quality, and have wonderful sound.<br />There are larger cameras that have similar features for somewhat less money. There are also larger cameras that cost more than the Elph. With the exception of the 4 megapixel S-400 though, I can't think of any that offer better image quality and features in as small and durable a package. Even then, the S-400 costs much more. If the S-200 takes a trip over Niagra falls, it is a lot easier to deal with.<br />I just ordered the new S-400 Elph to satisfy my incurable desire for leading edge photographic toys. It is a little heavier than the S-200, but has all of the latest refinements, including an extended movie mode. It also costs $... Even after it arrives, my S-200 will still be the camera that is always in my pocket, ready to go at a moments notice.<br />Consider this; After eight months of constant abuse (just stuffed into any convenient pocket with keys, dirt, whatever, on a daily basis), it doesn't show any signs of wear. Plastic cameras simply can't compete. The lens door is so well made that despite it's working environment, I have never had dirt penetrate to the lens surface. After taking well over 2,000 photographs, it performs like new, and delivers high quality SLR class images. It makes better 5x7 images than many larger 3 megapixel cameras, and delivers solid 8x10 performance. If you have a computer, you can enjoy and manipulate all of your work without spending a fortune on processing fees.<br />Last, and most important, is the simple truth that this camera is so small and tough that you will carry it with you with no more fuss than a ring of keys. After all, the best SLR in the world is useles if it is sitting at home when a photographic opportunity pops up in front of you. If you can only justify one digital camera for all of your family photographic needs, get the S-200. You will be amazed. If you can justify as many cameras as you would like, get the S-200 or the S-400. I bet it will become your most often used camera.<br />Update (3/23/03). When I ordered the S-400, I also ordered a 24x 250mb Compact Flash card. The 24x refers to how fast the card can store an image. It also determines how fast you can take another picture. I bought this card for the S-400, but the card arrived first, so I tried it in my S-200. At the time the S-200 was made, 128 meg was the largest card available, and I wasn't sure if a larger card would work properly.<br />The results were fantastic. The S-200 had no problem recognizing the 250mb card right out of the box. The 24x write speed makes taking sequential photos without flash seem like a motor drive was installed (sequential flash photo speed is limited by flash recharge time on any camera). Best of all, the S-200 with the 256mb memory card will take over 250 (that's right, 250!) max resolution photos without having to download or carry a spare memory card. That could well be an entire vacations' worth of pictures in the palm of your hand.<br />The price of the S-200 has dropped since I bought it. The cost of high speed 256mb Compact flash memory today is about what I paid for the 128mb card when I bought the camera. This makes the combination an even better value than before. If cash is no problem, buy the S-400. It is simply awesome with the quantity of up to date features packed into the tiny steel case, but if you prefer an album full of beautiful 5x7 or 8x10 prints from an inexpensive pocket dynamo, but this combination. You won't regret it.<br />By the way, there are many brands of Compact Flash memory available, and several offer high speed. The brand I bought was Lexar. I'm sure others will work just fine, but Lexar offered the fastest (24x) at the time, and I know it works with the Canon line. They also include a USB adapter with the 256mb card, so if you don't happen to have a CF card reader built into your PC or laptop, you can download your images to any computer with a USB port without special software or cables. A nice touch if you are away from home and want to email your pictures from a library or internet cafe.","Really well designed, especially compared to the Nikon 2500, which I also use.  I have had the camera over 7 months and use it all the time.<br />Pros: Fits in my pocket, starts up quickly, feels solid, good battery life.  Video is really fun, but available length of clip is hard to judge. The Canon case (...) designed for it is better than any non-OEM case I could find.<br />Cons: Lens flare, lens flare, lens flare.  Bright overcast skys cause washout  of the top of the image. If you don't care about what your images look like, it's not a problem.  However, I find it extremely annoying.  I print on a color printer and send images to Shutterfly, and both methods result in the same washed out look to the contrasting elements (trees, houses, hair, etc) against the sky. With a deep blue sky, no problem. Also, I use a 256MB card.  When the card is nearing capacity, switching to playback of still images is painfully slow.<br />Other: Get the 3.2 Megapixel version.","After almost six months of using this camera... I've decided it's one of the most versatile image and video aquisition devices I've used. I heartily recommend purchase.<br />First, the photos. It takes really nice photos, deals well with low light and high light conditions (I have many awesome pictures shooting into the sun! Beautiful.) There are extensive automatic and manual controls. I print my photos through Apple's iPhoto (which imports well from the camera) and even after significant cropping, 4x6 photos are indistinguishable from 35mm photos.<br />The video mode is impressive. This is a feature I didn't pay much attention to, but it really is a killer feature. I would never shlog around a video camera unless it was for special occasions where I knew there'd be lots to record. But with the PowerShot... it's small so you can take it everywhere... and it records great little videos ready for the web. Granted, its not as high of a resoulution as standard video, and the length is limited (a couple of minutes on a 128 MB CF card, but for capturing quick video (recently, of skier against a gorgeous mountain backdrop) it is priceless. QuickTime in Mac OS plays them flawlessly (even in the Finder under Mac OS X). The one caveat is not to film vertical orientation... because then there's no easy way to flip it. Did I mention it records sound?<br />The preview mode is also good, smart enough to rotate pictures taken with a vertical orientation. And you can preview the movies (although without sound).<br />Connecting to a Mac works well, either through the provided USB cable, or via Compact Flash card and adapter to a PC Card slot. The cable to connect to RCA input is pretty handy, as you can view pictures and video on a TV if your are away from a computer.<br />Battery wise, there are some problems... after going through a 128 MB CF card of photos, you are going to have to recharge... that's my experience... also, there doesn't seem to be a battery indicator until you are out of power.<br />Overall, a great investment!","If you are like me, and know nothing about digital cameras, i would highly recomend this camera. It is very easy to use and the picture quality is EXCELENT. This camera is worth every penny.I highly recomend this camera to anyone considering buying a digital camera.","I am very pleased with the Canon Power Shot S200.  The camera is everything that I was looking for.  The size is perfect, the pictures are clear and also very user friendly.  I had previously purchased another brand, which I returned, and am very satisfied with my decision. I also am very pleased with Amazon, the arrival date was exactly what they had said it would be and the price of course could not be beat!","I just received my Canon S200 and have done some test shooting.  The bottom line is that this camera will take great pictures in the auto mode if you want a point-and-click camera, and it has plenty of advanced features if you're a more experienced user.  Like any camera, however, you can't rely on the auto settings to get it right every time, so a little photography 101 homework is necessary.<br />... The few negative comments (in my humble opinion) were mostly not THAT negative, or they were buyers who hadn't figured out the basics of digital photography. ...<br />Asides from the excellent picture quality, you'll be pleased with the quality construction of the camera - all stainless steel except for the memory card and battery doors - not big deal, although it would of been nice to see it all stainless on the outside.  But rest assured, you won't find a camera built much better than this.  The feel/operation of the control buttons are that of precision manufacturing.  The LCD display is excellent, as is the menu set up.<br />Some reviewers mentioned the need for a larger memory card than the suplied 8MB.  The 8MB card will hold only 7 shots on the highest quality / picture size setting, but I would only use that setting for printing or photo development. The camera takes very nice shots on the lowest quality/picture size setting,  which makes a approx. 79kb file - great for emailing...and you'll get 87 shots on the 8MB card!  You might find somewhere in between is best for you - you can always buy a larger card later.  Battery life isn't bad for moderate use - about an hour or so...it works for me, but a second battery for travel might be an idea (make sure you get the newer NB-1LH (840 mAh) battery that comes with the camera if you can). The supplied documentation is very good.<br />The movie setting, like most still cameras, is nothing to write home about.  It's good for a short \"merry Christmas\" to e-mail out. The microphone works very well. Buy a proper movie camera if you want to do serious movies.<br />I was ready to buy a low-end [camera], but for a bit more got the S200 from Amazon that is MUCH more feature-packed, more compact, a much better performer, and of higher quality construction by far.<br />Five stars!","I Love this camera!!!!  I had been using my fathers 100 model of the elph (which is no longer made) and fell in love. I have taken the best pictures of my son and the color and clarity at a 5x7 print is just wonderful.  I purchase another canon, the A40,  slightly cheaper (with the same abilities as the S200), yet returned it and paid more for THE SIZE of Canon S200.  I can put this in my purse(an evening purse) and take pictures in places that I wouldnt want to lug a camera case to.","I bought the camera due to its perfect balance between size and picture quality.  I've been deployed in Afghanistan since September 02 and this camera has been with me every step of the way. I have been totally satisfied and like some of the other raters, I also recommend a larger memory stick and spare battery.","Great size -- I make photographs more often because this is easy to carry.  Great pictures -- for the sake of file size, I don't need more than 2 Mbyte.  Good ruggedness -- the metal case protects the camera well and looks good.  Bad battery life -- I have two rechargeable batteries and usually need both to fill up a 32 MByte compact-flash card with about 50 photos using the LCD display.  I recognize that the small size of the camera is made possible by smaller batteries, and smaller batteries mean shorter battery life, but the battery life limits the usefulness of the camera.","This camera is a dream. It does everything you want it to and more.. It even auto-flips your photos so everything is right-sideup! The camera works flawlessly with windows XP and Macs and it is so easy to create photos or even MOVIES. Plus it's so small that you can easily carry it around without having to string it around your neck, looking like a tourist.","I didn't give this camera 5 stars but it deserves 4 1/2 which means I really like it and recommend it over the Casio Exilim EX-S2 which is half as thick. Both cameras were candidates for purchase until I discovered the Canon Powershot S200 produced better pictures for enlargement.I went ahead and purchased it for snapping pictures of machine parts which can be zoomed in on for greater detail through the viewer on the back.","I didn't give this camera 5 stars but it deserves 4 1/2 which means I really like it and recommend it over the Casio Exilim EX-S2 which is half as thick.

Let's begin with my title, \"The good, the bad, and the ugly\"...THE UGLY-well, there is no ugly.  The camera looks that good.  Just taking the camera with you will make you cool (I mean, not that I needed any help or anything, but if you do, that's ok and this is the camera for you).  The GOOD-for a camera the size of a, actually its the only little rectangular shaped thing I own that small.  It is small, period.  I carry it in my front jeans pocket when I go out and pretty much don't know its there.  I bought this camera knowing that it will be going with me on trips to Asia, and Europe and around town.  I don't like being a \"tourist\" (ie camera on shoulder, carry bags), so this camera is a dream.  I will add, it is surprisingly durable as well, you can tell as soon as you hold it.  OK, the Pictures.  LCD screen, awesome.  Bright, crisp, wish my TV was that good, hmmmm...wish my monitor was that good.  The photos, here is the deal.  You need to learn how to take pictures with the camera.  Outdoors, no biggie.  Takes great great pictures.  I have even entered some in contests.  Indoors-a little bit of a bummer.  My only real gripe with the camera.  Indoor pictures with any camera are not the easiest, but with digital, even harder.  I don't know about other digitals, but with the elph, lots of red eye and dark background.  A little trick-indoors in sufficient lighting situations, shut the flash OFF, and what you see in the LCD is what you get, usually a better picture than with flash.  With practice indoor shots will be sufficient.  Batteries, Cannon NB-1LH.  Right.  Because you don't know what that means, let me tell you.  You are not going to find them at Target, or 7-11.  They work pretty well though and the camera comes with a charger and one battery.  You probably won't buy an extra battery now, but later you will want an extra battery...trust me, I'm telling you.  Oh by the way...I am not a Cannon rep or anything, but ONLY buy the Cannon NB-1LH battery-again just trust me and listen.  8MB memory card-The camera comes with it, and it is enough memory for you to realize the camera is the greatest thing since sliced bread- you will want a bigger memory card.  Well, in conclusion:  Would I buy this camera again?  100% Yes.  The camera is just awesome.  You will have so so so much fun with it.  That I can guarantee.  Great pictures, video mode (with GOOD sound quality (only 12 seconds though)), comes with cables to hook up to the TV, probably one of the greatest things I have ever bought.  It is one of those deals where after buying it, you won't know how you lived without it before.  I don't know if a camera can add to the quality of a persons life, but you will definitely have more fun.  By the way, be prepared for every person you take a picture of to want to see your camera.  Prepare yourself now for the fact you are going to have other peoples fingerprints all over it.  :)  Peace out, and enjoy life!~","The best digitals still can't quite match the best film cameras for those most challenging of shots.  But unless you're a professional photographer, you won't even notice the subtle differences, much less appreciate them.  For the shots taken by the rest of us, a camera like the Canon S200 is all we'll ever need.<br />The little Canon S200 Elph is remarkable.  When you first take it out of the box and hold it, you'll know you haven't made a mistake.  It's like a little jewel, artfully designed, solidly constructed.  The metallic body is all shimmery and shiny and, well ...  Dare I say \"precious\"?  (If Gollum had one of these, he'd forget all about that stupid ring.)<br />Stop reading the reviews and order one now.  If you're disappointed, don't take it back, go see a shrink.  You have issues.  Seriously.","I read every review I could get my hands on about this camera and am glad I did, because everyone is right about the S200, it is great. Some reviewers said you couldn't turn off the flash, well you can. The camera comes with a good user guide and also good software. I was shooting pictures in about 15 min. and downloading to my computer in about a hour. This is my 2nd digital camera and it is far superior to my 1mp HP 100 which 2 years ago cost me about the same. The s200 elph has a nice solid feeling. I feel that I have made an excellent choice in digital photograpy.","I love how compact it is as I always missed out on taking pictures of places I`ve been because I didn`t want to LUG THE OLE CAMERA .  2 Mega Pixels are fine for \"average joe\" picture taking , I actually use less resolution (a feature the camera has) because most of my pics are for the computer or my website ... and don`t need such large files.<br />Excellent camera for the price as of jan 3rd 2003 (I wrote date coz things change quick in this New Age world of ours","It took me a long time to decide to \"go digital\" and even longer to figure out which specific camera to buy. I'm fairly techno-crippled (faxes and microwaves still seem like magic to me and I still have to rely on my children to program my VCR).  Because of my limitations I felt positively overwhelmed by the information to consider when I tried to pick which digital camera to buy.  I read as much technical information as I could stand (not very much) and listened to the advice of family and friends until my eyes glazed over.<br />Finally I decided to purchase this particular camera for several reasons.  First, Canon was a brand of camera I'd owned and liked in the past; second, this model seemed to deliver the most features at the lowest price; and finally it looks good and has a cute name (pause while eyes of the tecno-literate roll).<br />The day after I got the camera I took it with me on a family vacation.  I started taking pictures almost right away -- although figuring out how to download the software onto my laptop took a bit of time and exploring all the things I can do with the pictures (like printing and emailing) is still in the works.  But I don't think any of this is a problem of the product -- everything in the documentation seems clear enough that even a moron like me ought to be able to put this together (eventually).<br />Here are some of the things even I can do already --<br />1)  I take pictures, choose which shots I don't like, delete them right away and take a new picture.  This is great if you have a nine-year old who loves to ham it up for photos (i.e., now mommy is going to take this picture again.  This time without the silly faces).  This is great for posed shots -- now you can be sure you got that great picture of your family in front of Cinderella's castle BEFORE you walk away.<br />2) I can hook up the camera to my computer, download pictures and enlarge them to see if I still like them (you can't see on the itty bitty screen on the camera if someone has thier eyes closed for example).  I delete pictures I don't like.  I may not be able to take a picture over at this point but I used to pay to have the shot developed only to throw the picture away later.  What a waste.  Plus now I only print the best of the best and only what I need.<br />3) I can (and do) carry the camera everywhere.  This camera is about the size of a double deck of cards.  It tucks in a pocket or purse (it even fit in my tiny evening bag along with my lipstick and credit card).  I found I was much more likely to take this little camera with me and got some great picures I might have missed otherwise.<br />4) I had no problems figuring out how to charge the battery, put the battery in the camera and load the flashcard (I did get the 128MB flashcard and never ran out of room).  It was a bit more difficult figuring out how to hook the camera to the computer and download the pictures but again, I think these are mostly my limitations not the product's or the documentation.<br />Some disapointments, though not unexpected, were that it is hard to take \"action\" shots as there is a delay between pushing the button and taking the picture that is hard to get used to.  Also, sometimes I accidentally flipped the switch and was taking motion pictures instead of still pictures.  It was hard to figure out how to delete the motion pictures I did not want and I did miss the still photos I had wanted to take.<br />It will probably be a few years before digital photography catches up to film photography in quality and at a price the average user can afford, but in the meantime this is a great camera to learn with while still capturing your memorable moments in photos.  I highly recommend this camera for people like me who are not particularly good with new technologies.","Charge the battery and you are ready to go.  This is as easy a digital camera as you will find.  The 2.1 Mega-Pixel is not the greatest, however, for the average user that wants a fairly inexpensive camera, this is a good choice.","The only thing I don't like about this camera is the battery life.  At my usage level (about average for most people), the battery lasts a week or less.  I'm thinking about getting a second battery.  Other than that, the camera is fantastic.  It is so small I've forgotten it in my coat pocket.  The pictures are very good.  I use a free account at Dotphoto.com to upload my pictures and have them printed and mailed to me just like mail-off film processing.  I can hardly tell that the prints are digital.  The service is pricy at $.30 per print but being able to pick the photos to print makes it worthwhile.  No more debating what to do with underexposed prints from a film camera, etc.  The camera has a great menu system and a quick input response.  Lots of options including up to 15-sec exposure, white balance, tone, self-timer adjustments, and much more.  My 32-MB card holds 40 pics or so at top resolution, which is plenty for me to get back to my computer and download.  I am very happy with this purchase, and plan to keep and use it for as long as I possibly can.","I recveived this as a gift for christmas. I originally was hoping to get the Nikon 2500 but htis is far superior in a number of ways. It takes 15 sec bursts of uncompressed AVI video with sound!! The video looks great. Strait out of the box I was taking pictures, I have a Canon SLR so the interface was a breeze didn't even need to crack the manual. Everything you need comes with it except I would suggest buying a second battery and a 128Mb flashCard, definatly worth it. Hooking the camera up to your TV to watch your videos is just two steps, and your watching. The pictures this camera turns out are amazing, you can customize everything on the fly, film speed, auto exposuring, you name it this is the only choice in my opinion for under 400 bucks. Canon is the only way to go and this proves it.","Great little camera. If you want a carrying case, I'd skip the hard-to-find official PowerShot case. It's flimsy and not fully sealed, with just a little velcro holding the camera in. Get the LowePro D-Res 8S, it's better made, padded, and just a bit bulkier. Make sure you get the 8S, which is sized for the S200, and not the 8 (no S) which is bigger and made for the 330. You will need some sort of case -- you would not want to leave the lcd screen exposed to scratches.","I've been an amateur photographer for 50+ years.  I've had all kinds of film cameras, including a compact Contax and a Hasselblad.  The Contax was handy and sharp, but it used FILM, which meant two trips to the camera or drug store, one to leave off exposed film, another to pick up the prints, many of which were no good.  The Hasselblad was a 'hassel.'  You had to remember too much stuff for an amateur and it was big and bulky, not exactly portable or good for snapshots on the run.  This Canon is terrific on all counts.  It is easy to carry in a jacket or shirt pocket, so it can be whipped out at a moment's notice.  You don't need to worry about settings; everything is automatic and the results are great.  I have memory cards of 96 and 128MB, which means I can take 40-60 shots, review them in the computer as 'slide show' and quickly pick out the half dozen or so that are keepers.  With film camera I was losing interest.  With this compact, handy digital I'm a photo enthusiast again, even able to do nature close-ups.  I highly recommend this great camera for amateurs.  I'm told that professionals are using the higher priced Canons, not only because of the optics, but the graphics software.","I was given this camera by co-workers on 12/16/02.  I was asked what I wanted and my response was a digital camera because I couldn't seem to spend my own money on it.  The spending limit was $300.<br />I went to Amazon and reviewed all the reviews.  I then went out and looked at the cameras.  I liked the Canon and that is what they got me.<br />It is really nice.  It is easy to take pictures and wasn't too hard getting them to the PC.  It fits in a hip pocket.<br />I have been dicking with and I have taken about 150 pictures.  Currently 75 pictures are still with me and I have deleted about 75.  I have e:mailed maybe 20.<br />I am shooting the 640x480 mode in Superfine.  The pictures are about 150k.  It is really nice.  640x480 in the Fine mode are about 100k.<br />Dad didn't like digital photo's because they wouldn't print very well.  As it turned out, my sister sent him scanned pictures of Polaroids.  He really disliked digital cameras due to the print quality.<br />Once I amassed a quantity of photos, I began to print some.  While not perfect (with a cheap printer and regular paper), they were nice.<br />Dad, who had better printing capabilities, denounced his dislike of digital cameras and asked politely for more pictures.  He is having great success printing them.<br />I did buy more Flash Card memory.  I got the 128mb card at Price Club for $50.  I have a few pictures on the camera and it says I can take another 577 at the 640x480 superfine resolution.<br />I will probably buy another battery (just because that is the type of person I am), but it has not been an issue.<br />By the way, I haven't taken any pictures with my Canon Rebel since I got this camera and we haven't gone through the 5 rolls of film that was recently developed that we collected over the last few months.  I now have instant gratification.<br />Digital cameras are very nice if you have kids and/or grandparents.  And the Canon S200 is easy to keep with you and actually take pictures with.  I haven't had much success with the movie mode, but from what I have seen, it can be very cool.<br />Now that I know what it is all about, I would have bought it for myself.  The Canon S200 is a complete and robust package.<br />The software that comes with the camera is pretty nice also (perhaps I have low expectations).  It is very easy to manage the photo's and also enhance them.  I am very happy.<br />If you want some pictures of a awfully cute boy, let me know.  I also pasted a bunch of stuff into Word and created a PDF and it is really nice.<br />Of course, I only have this robust camera made of metal in my hip pocket.  Perhaps some of those bigger plastic cameras are as nice, but you would have to prove it to me...<br />I would have done 5 stars if the movie length (which I haven't had any success with yet) lasted to the end of your memory.  I haven't has success due to low light levels when there was a subject to shoot.  It works fine, the results were disappointing.<br />Art","This digital camera has alot of features that are very nice considering the size.Not to happy with the software it comes with and wished they included a case with the camera.But over all the camera alone is well worth it,easy to carry anywhere and takes very nice pictures a must have for every day use or just for those special occasions.Seem to be very durable and cool assecories like the under water cover for those pictures on a vacation or at a event in the rain.","I think for starters who's never used a digital camera before like me would have absolutely no complaints with it. For graduate students like me you don't need a professional camera to click images....all you do with a camera is click beautiful and sharp images to keep it for longlasting memories and for sharing with your other friends. So i felt that portability is the main factor along with very good pictures and well ofcourse economically friendly enough....I'm very much satisfied with this. Frankly speaking, I'm not really aware of the techinical jargon associated with the digicams so bought it just by reading the other reviews and BELIEVE ME......People are not joking......They are talking sense and are happy with it and probably want to share it with the others just as i'm doing it right now.....Have fun with your new camera though......hopefully canon powershot.","Camera very good but shutter [is bad]. When flashing you have to press the button for an annoying length of time. Seems variable too so it is very hard to guess when it will go and get a moving subject. Also even when you have the flash turned totally off the red eye reduction small pre flash still goes off totally ruining the element of surprise. It takes very good low light no flash pictures. I am thinking of just duck taping over the flash window. But other than this it is a fine little camera and a lot of fun. I think it takes great pictures.  TORD<br />I have no use for a ship that does not sail fast for I intend to go in harms way. JPJ","It's amazing what you can fit in such a small package. You can read the features, I won't waste time there, but what I can say is that this is the best digital camera in its class, hands down. I have tried Olympus, Fuji, Sony, etc. etc., but nothing comes close to this camera. What mainly surprised me was the sturdiness and durability of the body, buttons, and display. The camera just feels great in your hands, not cheap and plastic.<br />Image quality is excellent in most conditions, and very good in the dark, in my experience. This is even on the lowest quality mode. If you're having trouble getting good pictures in the dark, use the flash -- that's why it's there! Don't expect the camera to magically take an amazing picture without light. The flash, by the way, is excellent -- it fills well and is plenty bright.<br />I take most of my pictures at 1024x768, but the 1600x1200 mode is still excellent. I've seen cameras that take grainy pictures in the highest resolutions, but not this one. Great quality all around. Printed pictures also look excellent in 1600x1200 at 4x6 and even 8x10, if you don't mind a slight loss of resolution. If you need to make prints at 8x10, and still want all the greatness of this camera, get the new 3.2 Megapixel Canon Digital Elph S-230. It is a bit more expensive, but you get what you pay for -- an extra megapixel of resolution.<br />One other great feature worth mentioning is the Canon Image stitching software to put together 360 degree or multiple-shot panoramas. It works great. I have some great panoramas from everywhere from the tops of mountains to Memorial Stadium during Big Game.<br />And did I mention how small this camera is? Pocket sized. Literally. No comparison.","This camera is very easy to use. It is compact in size, but don't let the size fool you.  It takes excellent photo images and you can start taking pictures within minutes of taking it out of the box.  It is also easy to load them on the computer for e-mail or editing.  Even though it comes with a 32mb flash card, you will want to purchase at least a 64mb card immediately.<br />32mb = 7 photos. 64mb = 71 photos that can be stored on the card.","Okay, so I am buying this camera for a second time (as a X-mas gift) because it is simply a wonderful camera.<br />One person mentioned a vaild problem; The issue is about snowflakes appearing in some dark shots.  I *think* this is actually due to the compression algorithm, rather than a physical flaw.  I always keep my compression at \"superfine\" and I  have not had that problem.  One can still easily control the size of their image by setting the number of pixels.<br />I briefly looked at the S230 but quickly came back to the S200.  I really believe that for the vast majority of people, this camera has more than enough resolution.  Save your money!<br />Driver Info:<br />For Windows XP; installing the driver is very simple<br />For Windows 98; I wasn't as fortunate, but I *eventually* got it to work (however, this is a minor thing, a one time thing, so I wouldn't use it as a basis for a decision)<br />For RedHat 8.0; It is as simple as it gets, (the driver is already included in the \"Digital Camera Tool\", all you gotta do is pick the camera name.","I absolutely love my S200 Elf. I've had it for several months now and it's performed flawlessly. It's easy to use, takes great pictures, has a very simple interface, compact and quick battery charger (and the battery life is incredible). And you just can't beat the size and weight of this thing. My ONLY complaint is that there's no way to default the camera to \"no flash\". You have to manually press a button anytime the camera has been turned off in order to get it back to \"no flash\" again. It's a minor annoyance in an otherwise perfect camera.","I spent the better part of a week gawking at digital cameras, and ultimately ended up purchasing the Cannon PowerShot S200 Digital Elph.  Overall, I am happy very with it.<br />Unlike the other cameras, this one had some additional features to put it over the top: it is the smallest camera in its class, has a rechargeable battery (the others needed AA or AAA batteries), and it uses Compact Flash cards.  Some of the other camera manufacturers only used pricey proprietary memory sticks or memory cards.<br />Software is included for Windows machines and there is support for Linux.  Redhat Linux 8.0 supported the USB camera connection, out of the box, without needing to install additional software.<br />There is only one annoyance - there is a delay between pressing the button and when the picture is actually taken.  Aside from that, the camera is basically a point and shoot camera, with good clarity and color.<br />A carrying case isn't included, so I'd recommend purchasing a small camera case and an extra compact flash card.  I'm happily using a 64MB card.","The camera is very durable; the case is metal.  the LCD display has great resolution for its size (1.5\").  Most pictures have been in focus for me, including indoors.  The flash works well when used at a practical distance... a few feet (don't aim 100ft away and complain if it's too dark).  Battery life hasn't been a problem for me, either.  You may want a backup battery if you go out and take lots of pictures like on trips.  It's only a 2.0MP camera, so don't rely on the zoom.  It comes with an 8MB cf card; good for perhaps a couple movies or a few pictures.  Realistically, make sure you can afford a 128MB cf card before purchasing this (or any other) camera.  As usual, carry-case (psc-100) sold separately.  I like the camera and enjoy taking pictures with it because it's so small and takes clear, colorful pictures.  It's not perfect... but it's small and works great.","Having had experience of digital cameras, this one is good - I wouldn't call it low end, its worth the money and a good comparison to quite a few other cameras. Having to lug around an extra battery (the weighty few grams) is no hassle, and although it would be nice to see what the battery life is - for such a small camera its acceptable. I would recommend purchasing a larger memory card, 128mb at least, because you will find out you'll enjoy taking many many pictures. Also canon makes a great micro fiber case for this, worth getting to tote around this tiny item. Plus it'll hold an extra battery and compact flash.<br />The video option is cute and small, and great for recording moments. I captured my relatives baby words and steps and easily emailed the video to quite a few people.<br />I would recommend buying a usb card reader as to speed up the process of uploading your pictures to your computer. Connecting the camera through the included USB cable can consume quite a bit of battery life (if you don't have an AC adapter).<br />Overall, this canon is a great buy, a tiny digital camera that goes with you wherever and allows you to experience photography. True its not as sharp as a film camera, but the benefits of a digital camera have great advantages almost balancing it out to a film camera.","Digital point and shoot cameras should not be looked at as a replacement to film cameras, the quality just isn't good enough for anything important or for images that you need to enlarge. But, for the convenience of being able to email your snapshots or upload them to a webpage or online auction quickly and easily, nothing beats a digital cam. The image quality of this Canon is acceptable if you understand that you will not be able to match 35mm film quality. The color saturation on the images is surprisingly good however you will notice some milky haze around some of the edges and background if you look closely. This is common (and expected) for low and mid range digital cameras such as this one.<br />I bought this camera over the newer S230 model because of the price and the fact that the S230 has longer shutter lag. While the S230 has more megapixels, I wasn't willing to pay so much for images that would just end up being emailed and on webpages anyway. And the longer shutter lag in the S230 is unwelcomed. The image quality and 'look' is equal in both cameras as far as I can tell, of course the S230 model just makes them a bit larger.<br />This camera is quite small, which makes it convenient to have with you all the time, or to put in your camera bag as an addition to other cameras.<br />It only comes with an 8MB compactflash card. You will need another one. I recommend at least 128MB, which should give you 180 image capacity in the best picture quality mode with 'Super Fine' compression.<br />The propriatary battery doesn't seem to last very long so it seems like an extra battery would be needed if you are going to rely on this camera a lot. But this will mean that you will have to carry around the extra battery, which adds a bit of inconvenience.<br />All in all, Canon makes good digital point and shoot cameras for the money. The unit has a lot of features other manufacturers do not include (such as black and white and sepia modes as well as macro mode for close up photography) and it feels quite sturdy and designed well. It doesn't replace 35mm film cameras (nothing but the highest multi-thousand dollar digital cameras will), but for general snapshots and as a complement to your film cameras, this camera provides acceptable results.","In short - it lives up to it's hype.  I've handled many digital cameras and most feel lik echeap plastic.  This is metal, feels solid, not junk.  And yes, small.  Still learning to do new things with is, seems pretty well designed.  Even the manual is written well.  It comes with an 8MB flashcard - pretty small, I got a 256 MB flashcard for it cheap on ebay.  I also purchased a tailor-made carrying case for it from Canon for [X].  (Better than scratching the LCD and should I ever drop it, might be very good protection.)<br />Next, I will purchase an underwater enclosure and take it into the ocean.  (I live in Hawaii.)<br />I've used it a lot and found no shortcomings.  Pretty safe purchase, especially if you can get it at a good price.","This product is GREAT.  We really enjoy the size--eay to \"tote and carry\".  We never leave home without it. It is very handy to carry along on all of our island hopping expeditions,  especially to Great Inagua,  Bahamas.","It's a good value, and extremely portable.  However, it takes forever to take pictures using a flash.  I have used much better digital cameras where as soon as you press the button, the camera will initiate the picture taking.  There is no way to check the status of your battery life, a warning light comes on shortly before the battery dies.  Picture quality is good when using highest quality settings, I've printed many pictures and they all turn out great.  But beware, this camera is horrible for taking pictures up close, and the zoom is quite lacking.  The menu is also not user friendly and the controls can be quite confusing.  It's a great, portable camera, but if you want a lot of features, this is not it.","This camera is fantastic for convenience. It realistically fits in your pocket, and its compact brick-like shape means nothing is protruding and getting dented as you walk around. I take it places that I'd never take a larger camera, because I can bring it along without a big camera pack hanging off my shoulder.<br />The main complaint I have is that the image quality isn't great. It's good enough for snapshots, but I've had a lot of so-so pictures. My former digital camera, an Olympus D-460 with only 1.3 megapixels, took sharper and better-looking images. A lot of my pictures on this camera look all right from far away but up close everything is a little fuzzy.<br />Here's a summary of my pros and cons with the camera:<br />Pluses:<br />* Size -- it really can fit in your pocket.<br />* The charger is small and light-weight and works in standard 2-prong 110V outlets.<br />* Nice viewing of shots on the camera -- loads quickly and there is speedy and good navigation, even when I had 100s of pictures.<br />* Battery life is great.<br />* Video mode is a blast.<br />* Battery charges quickly, around 2 hours from totally dead.<br />* You can plug the camera into a TV with included cables and view your photos there.<br />Minuses:<br />* Picture quality isn't great.<br />* Sometimes when you take a picture with the flash, it takes forever (we're talking holding the button for 10 seconds or more) to take. I found I could improve this by depressing the button slightly to get the light setting, seeing the red light go one, and *then* pushing hard to take the picture, then waiting another second or two for it to take. But try explaining that to a Chinese person who you don't know who's taking your picture for you!<br />* No software included to create a slideshow. I was hoping for something that would make a nice picture-and-video slideshow.<br />* The video mode can't adjust to different light settings in the course of filming, so whatever setting you start with is the same one it will maintain even when the light changes.<br />* No warning before your battery dies. The warning light comes on and poof! 30 seconds later the camera's dead.<br />* No sound on video playback on the camera (there is sound when the clip is downloaded to a computer or played on a TV).<br />* Maximum imposed recording limit for videos, regardless of how much memory is on your memory card. At the middle quality setting it's about 10 seconds, and at the low quality about 30.<br />Overall I think the camera's size makes it a good camera, it could use some improvements particularly in picture quality but for casual snapshots it'll do the job. A similar camera worth checking out is the Minolta Dimage X. It's slightly smaller, has longer video recording capability, greater zoom, and audio on video playback, but I've heard the picture quality is worse than the Elph.","I just wanted a digital camera I can fit in my pocket and walk around with everyday.  This did the job.  Not only that, the camera's pictures amazed me.  I can even take short videos with sound!  The first day I used it in public, people around me were amazed how tiny this camera is.  I use to own a HP315, but the S200 beats it 100%.<br />If there are anything to nit-pick about... I wish the camera can record videos longer than 10-20 seconds.  Regardless of your Compact Flash size, it can only take videos that long.  You need to keep recording after the 10-20 seconds.  Also, if you want to Zoom more than 2x, try the Canon S330 or I believe the S230 has it as well.","First digital camera.  Very good picutre quality.  Easy to operate.  Would recomend to othrers. Must buy more memory the 8mb is a JOKE.  I would suggest a 128 that will hold enough photos for you.  Price is good to.","This is my 3rd digital camera and by far and away the most simple to use.  I have found the digital quality to be excellent.  Downloading my pics is fast and easy with the software that comes with this unit.  I believe this is a great buy for 90% of digital users who just want to take pics of their friends and family.  Before deciding on this camera, I looked at many ratings of digital camera's on several different websites.  I talked to several people in a variety of retail stores deciding that most did not know a camera from a pogo stick.  And lastly I talked with many of the people I know who own more expensive models.  What I found out was that the folks who buy more features and megapixels...generally don't use their camera for anything more than I do.  I just got back from Vegas and believe that some of the pics I took are as good if not better than the postcards I saw.  I would rate this product a smart buy.","OK, I'll keep this short and sweet.  I took this Cam to Sydney and Melbourne for 2 weeks and I am totally satisfied with its performance.  Me and a friend each took one and we each shot 1000 pics and neither of us have 1 complaint about it!  We took pics and video all day and night.  Small enough to take with you even at night.  We took great pics and used it in full tourist mode (on/off all the time).  Not once did we run out of battery (taking 150/day at times @ 1600 X 1280).  Just make sure you buy 128Mb RAM.  One note, we took a laptop otherwise we would have been limited to the amount of pics (we would dump them off every day).  It holds a killer charge, the movies while small and short give you added joy when you come back (specially in the taxi cabs and the clubs with music).  In short, if you're looking for great pics, small cam and plenty of power -- this is the camera for you!","See my review on the S120 because most things still apply.  Canon made a few positive changes on the camera interface side but most things are the same as the earlier models (i.e. optical zoom, resolution etc.)  The new battery adds a little life but nothing earth shattering.<br />Still the best camera out there for the casual photographer.  I carry mine everywhere I go.<br />As with earlier models:<br />The zoom stinks, not a camera for profesionals<br />The 8mb memory card is a joke, get a 64mb or a 128mb<br />Even the new and improved battery isn't great, buy an extra one.<br />Good luck!","i bought this  camera a few days ago (10days),got a special deal from amazon, especially the price drop right now.GOOD PRICE and GOOD SERVICE. i decided to get Canon S200 because of its \"some manual\" control (which i'm really looking for) plus the size. I had a chance to compare this camera to Sony CD mavica 300, which we owned but its bulky. The picture quality...mmm.. the quality is good but i still like the quality of the Sony MVC 300 (using 2 megapixel), maybe this is due to the \"Carl Zeiss\" lens. I took about 250 pics(10 days), my only complaint was that i been getting some kind of \"snowflakes or \"spotting\" on my pics, about 1/3 of my pics have this. I'm not really sure whats wrong with it. First i thought there might be some kind condensation on the camera or in the lens but couldn't find the culprit. i also notice that the \"snowflakes\" or \"spotting\" only appears on a telephoto and dark shots.i'll be returning and exchanging this camera for a new one, i'll give it another try. One more thing i noticed is that the camera has some difficulty focusing during a low light + moving subjects (takes longer time to take a pic). well thats it for now....i'll tell more about it when i get the replacement.","This is my 4th digicam, the 3rd for Canon brands.  I have powershot a20, a40, and fuji finepix2800.  You notice that all I've been using is only 2MP camera because to me, 2MP is good enough for me.<br />OK, Love this camera.  Very small, same features as A40 in general.  I don't really care about the zoom feature.  I know it's only 2x optical + 3x digital zoom.  But that's not really important to me.  If you want zoom than buy yourself a high-end price camcorder.<br />The camera has lots of features.  When I first got the package, I charged the battery and it took only an hour to do so.  Very fast.  The body is nice, strong, and very fit to my hand.  The battery somehow takes about 1 hour to fully use it even with LCD.  I'm talking about constantly taking picture in 1 hr and the camera needs to be recharge.  The results is exclnt in most cases with lots of effects such as black & white, sephia, vivid color and lots more..... I know you're gonna love this camera, cause I do.<br />The reason I bought this camera cause I have a 3-month old baby boy.  I just can't get enough of him so I want to make sure I can take picture of him every moment and every second in between.  It really fits in my pocket without bothering me at all.  The camera it's just somehow heavy a bit but still considered light.  I was going to wait for the S230 to come in november but I think It's not worth the wait.  Anyway, I don't need 3MP.  I'm just an average users, not a pro.  Just for fun.... P>So guys..... remember, digicam is all about having fun with it.  Don't fall into 4MP, 5MP or maybe 6MP.  The quality is somewhat the same.  People has a tendency to get the biggest of everything to make them big as well.... typical human being.<br />  Not everything big is always big, sometimes small things can bring you happiness as well.  That's what I think about my Powershot S200.  Affordable in price, powerful in features, and small enough to carry it anywhere you want to take it.......","Love this camera -- Have taken over 1,000 photos with Cannon S200 during two vacation trips to NYC. I run the camera full out (1meg/picture), carry two 256M cards, and recharge my battery every night.<br />Pro -- Tiny, takes very good pictures, easy to use, fast. Extra praise for Vivid mode (my standard mode), lithium-ion battery (good for two days), included battery recharger (very light weight and no cable), orient switch (no rotated pictures), +/-2EV exposure adjust, Stitch mode (panorama photos), camera settings encoded into .jpg file, and good night photo capability (1s auto, 15s manual with noise reduction).<br />Con -- Getting pictures from the memory card to the computer can be trouble. On my Windows ME the (autostarting) download wizard stopped when it hit a movie file. Copying from a card reader resulted in rotated images. The fix is to download the memory from the camera with Windows explorer or Cannon ZoomBrowser. Comes with only a wrist strap.","I just recently bought a Canon S200 and i have to say, It's ALOT better than most cameras, even some cameras of higher MP. This is because it has a movie recording feature (yes other cameras have this too) but it records with sound! It records about 20fps and maybe lower if u record at max. resolution (640x480). The quality is great(resolution goes up to 1600x1200), it features auto focus, and for experts, you can control the ISO (theres an auto option for newbies). And the reason why I didn't give it 4 stars is becuase in movie mode, the lcd kinda blurs and gains static which is annoying and the quality on movies arn't that great. But, digital cameras arn't suppose to have superior movie qualities, that's what camcorders are for.","* It's TINY no bigger than a deck of cards, I can take it everywhere.<br />* It feels STURDY. Cased in stainless steel, not imitation spray-painted plastic.<br />* It takes AMAZING PICTURES. 2MP is just fine for 6X4 prints, and much more than enough for email shots.<br />* The USER INTERFACE is excellent. Very intuitive. Easy to learn. The LCD is clear and bright.<br />* The supplied BATTERY lasts all day long.<br />* It's MANUAL FUNCTION lets me be creative with my pictures<br />I bought 128MB more memory, a spare battery and a carry case. In my opinion these are essential and should all have been included in the kit, but they're not...<br />I have had a Canon Eos 35mm SLR for six years and have been very happy with it -- but the portability and unobtrusiveness of the ELPH means I can take it anywhere, and it takes photography somewhere new.","I've always wanted a digital camera and I finally settled on this one. I had several friends highly recommend it plus the reviews on Amazon looked very promising. They weren't wrong. I just love this thing! Slap a 128MB card in there and you can take so many good pictures! There are a lot of neat features to play with and different settings you can mess around with to get very nice pictures. The size of the camera is astounding. It fits right in your palm! Also, for all of you nerds out there, this USB camera works with Linux using gPhoto2 and gtKam! Definitely consider this digital camera.","I spent more time and energy to find a digital camera than my apartment, firing my neurons away on such a life-altering event of purchasing a pocket camera. Being a middle class ladder climber, it was like taking a test with multiple choice questions. I compared prices as well.  In short, I chose canon s200 for the simplest, clean design, and the hardest-looking, metal exterior.  Whoever designed this camera, I can get along with.  I chose Amazon.com instead of buy.com for the uncomplicated return policy.<br />The price is high for a 2MP camera, but I didn't want to spend $500 dollars for a 4MP camera. I rationalized by saying to myself if I don't buy another camera later, spending extra 50 to 100 dollars more is worth it.  2MP will serve my purpose as I am not going to print out posters from this camera. Besides, I don't have too much wall space to hang them. It is a size of a cigarette box, but as heavy as a unopened Budweiser can.  It would be nice if the camera came with a longer loop string to put around my neck rather than the small wrist loop. Don't drop it; don't lose it.  125 MP CF card should be big enough for anyone who behaves normally and takes a non-psychiatric number of pictures during a typical vacation trip.  This camera is for someone with a sense of moderation. If you supersize your Big Mac meal, don't buy this one.  This is for those who would rather take a picture of their children who will stand still and look up for 2 seconds if you are lucky.  No time to waste, just point and shoot.  If they want to try, let them; you can always erase it. Those who doesn't want to buy another digital camera shoud consider this one. I am not buying another one until I drop or lose this one.","I bought this camera as a birthday present for my wife about a month ago. It's our first digital camera, and we're basically \"point-and-shoot\" types.  So far we love it. The tiny size is a big plus as it easily fits in purse or pants pocket. It feels very solid and the controls are well laid out.  Even my wife (not technically inclined) finds the camera easy to use. It also has some neat features such the built-in automatic lens cover and automatically detecting whether you're taking portrait or landscape views and rotating the images internally.  It also has an amazing \"stitch\" feature which will combine several panorama photos taken end to end into one long image.  It automatically matches the edges!  It's slightly distorted, but still pretty neat.  How do they do that?  The way the menus are displayed on the LCD screen makes changing camera modes a breeze.  You can also upload pictures to your PC without pushing any buttons just by plugging it in!  The user manual seems well written considering the complexity of the subject.  Like others, I was disappointed that Cannon does not provide a case or larger CF card, but for the money the s200 still seems a good deal.  Our local 'big-box' store matched the best price I found on the internet.  The picture quality at high resolution is terrific. I view them on my 19\" PC monitor and they look very professional.  Even the medium res pictures look good.  Another unexpected plus was the included software.  I found it very easy to use and with plenty of features for a beginner.  The included ArcSoft PhotoImpression software does everything I want with a digital photograph including special effects editing, cropping, text layering, framing, making greeting cards and calendars, etc.  It simplifies placing multiple images or combinations on one page, which minimizes waste of pricey papers.  It also has a \"fantasy\" section that lets you create dummy magazine covers featuring faces from pictures you take.  Lot's of fun to play with, though I haven't fully explored it yet.  All told, we are very pleased and impressed with the camera.  While I'm sure other digital cameras provide many of the same features, Cannon's photographic reputation, other user reviews and the camera's small size ultimately sold me on this model.  This is a great little point-and-shoot camera, I only wish I'd had it on our trip to Europe!  I don't think we'll ever go back to 35mm again!","I didn't know anything about digital cameras, but I bought this one after several friends at work said they were very pleased with similar cannon models.  This is my first digital camera, and it was simple enough for me to use, but offers lots of features that enabled me to take good pictures even in some demanding conditions (although I still struggle taking well-focused shots in low light conditions).  When you look at the pictures I took during my 2 weeks in Europe, you can see the images increasing in quality as I learned how to better operate the camera.  I would recommend this as a very good point-and-shoot type model!","I'm a snapshot/vacation photographer who bought the Digital ELPH to supplement my regular film camera.  For someone like me, who is interested in taking decent photos but doesn't have the time or inclination to devote to the serious study of photography, this little camera is a godsend!  I've taken it on two trips in the month since I've owned it and my photos have improved just by virtue of being able to check the results near-instantaneously. With my film camera, I'd probably just be getting around to dropping the film off at the store right now.<br />The camera is easy to use intuitively, and the instruction book is good.  The size and weight are great for travel. I considered a Canon with better resolution, but decided I was unlikely to ever need prints larger than 8 x 10. I see the price has dropped some in the past month -- oh well.  I don't resent having paid more for it, which is probably the greatest praise I can offer!<br />A second battery is an absolute must.  The 8mb Compact Flash card the ELPH comes with will get you through the first day, but you'll definitely need a larger one (I bought a 256mb Viking, which was probably overkill but it was on sale, so ....).  Also, you'll need a case, as Canon doesn't include even a plastic sleeve with this camera.","I've had this camera about a month now and have shot nearly 300 pictures.  My pictures are mostly snap shots but have covered a wide range of indoor and outdoor people shots and landscapes. I've been very pleased with the results.  The camera size was the driving factor for me.  I had a 35mm SLR that was a pain to carry around and consequently I was missing a lot of pictures.  I purchased the camera, extra battery, 128mb card and a USB card reader and everything has worked out great. I've been really impressed with the panaorama shots and the little movies with sound.  The included software makes the panorama shots come together easily. Digital is the way to go and this little camera is great for general picture taking. I take a lot more shots now and don't worry about wasting film. My SLR is headed for eBay while it still has some value left in it.","I've had this camera about a month now and have shot nearly 300 pictures.

It is fairly easy to use and controls are quite intuitive.  There is a host of features I haven't used, and may never use, but the basic point, shoot and look is easy to use, both still and motion.  The pictures look great in either digital or hard copy.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.","I have had my Canon S200 for about a month now and am absolutley pleased with it's performance.<br />First the design: it is literally the exact size as a pack of cigarettes. (with the cool weight of a tiny gadget like a zippo lighter) Very sturdy feel, feels like a block of metal in your hands. The case does not get smudges from fingerprints and have not noticed any scracthes from everyday use.<br />Second, picture quality: I have only printed 4x6 prints onto photo quality paper from an Epson Photo printer and as an amateur photographer was amazed at the picture quality. Very crisp colors and details, from daytime outdoor pictures to nighttime indoor pictures. You can see tiny freckles on ppl's faces, good or bad I dont know. There is a macro mode for close-ups. A manual mode which is intuitive, for example, if you want to take Non-Flash shots where flash is not allowed, you dont have to set for No-flash everytime you turn the camera on and off. Set if for Manual Mode>No-Flash and everytime you turn the camera on and off the flash is automactically set off. (or vice-versa) ISO can me set, as well as shutter speed. which is also nice for more creative ppl, or for dark situations.<br />Third Battery life: I recently took a trip to LA, with two 64mg Compact Flash cards (set for highest resolution each card held approx. 180 images: the camera \"says\" the card can hold 70 images, but i kept on going to experiment and got different from 180-200 images!) So everyday I would take 120-140 images, go to my hotel recharge the battery, which lasted the whole day, download the images to my laptop and be ready for the next day. and a note, whether you set for high or low resolution the camera takes same amount of time \"writing\" or recording to disk which is btw very fast. I have both Sandisk and Fuji brand compact flash cards and have not noticed any performance difference.<br />I was deciding between the S200 and the S300 which are identical, except the S300 has 3X optical zoom instead of 2X, and also has a longer movie mode. 2MegaPixel is perfect for 4X6 prints and 8X10 prints also.<br />If you are new to digital cameras you will be absolutley satisfied with this camera's print quality, ease of use, battery life, as well as more advanced features which I have not used yet such as the longer shutter speeds. A good online source for digital camera research can be found here: dpreview.com and canon's site has sample pictures taken with this camera.<br />Have fun.","For the vast majority of the snap-shooting public, this tiny gem is probably the only camera that crowd will ever need.  I see people on once-in-a-lifetime vacations using those throw-away cameras to capture life-long memories on 4X6 prints. If only they had this camera and a decent sized memory card, they and their memories would be much better served. I have made 5X7 prints from mine and they are excellent. The 4X6 prints look like they could have been shot with a Nikon or Leica. In fact, I do magazine photography with my 35mm cameras but recently shot a MOMA gallery opening with the Elph (only camera I had with me). The shots we so good, they went into a national magazine. The 2X zoom, while adequate for parties and such, isn't wide enough in tight spaces. (Most people who want the 3X zoom Elph crave reach on the telephoto end - I crave my coverage on the wide end!) The software and cables included to download from the Elph are adequate but if you buy a USB card reader, you can do your image transfers without tying up the camera. The size is perfect so you can take it anywhere and the battery life is surprisingly good. I did get a spare battery but have not needed it. I also bought a 128Mb compact flash card so I can shoot at max resolution and not have to worry about running out of \"film.\" If you don't have a Digital Camera yet, get this one and you'll be hooked. - Here is a July 2003 update: Canon has improved this model with a 3 megapixel and 4 megapixel model. I tested the 4 MP version side by side with my 2 MP and could not see a quality difference in a 4X6 print. Thought you should all know!<br />Go check out the Canon G5 - better in every way and the prices are dropping! A real bargin.","I love this camera!  It takes really fantastic photos.  Highest resolution is 1600x1200, and all pics are taken at 180 dpi instead of 72 dpi like some digital cameras.  At the highest setting it's about 900 kb per picture, so just figure 1 picture per MB on your memory card.<br />Why is the camera so great?  For me it's two things.  First, the size.  This is a wonderful size for a camera.  Small enough to carry around with you, but all the controls are easy to reach and nicely sized.  It's small enough that even in the optional case I can fit this sucker in my pocket or keep it in my bag and carry it everywhere.  For me there's no point in having a 4 or 5 megapixel camera if I don't have it handy all the time to take pictures.<br />The second thing is that it takes really fantastic pictures.  With its highest setting you can print out 8x10's without noticeable artifacts.  It has a 2x optical zoom (never use digital zoom, it's like cropping and then resizing your picture) and a really good optic system.  Colors are crisp, and it snaps pictures extremely fast, so what you snap is what you get.  Some digital cameras take a second or more after you hit the button to take the picture.<br />Anyway, for its small size and great picture quality I highly recommend this camera!","This is by far the best camera I have ever bought.  It is my first digital camera, and it's performance far exceeds the performance of my past film cameras.  For its size and price, this camera is excellent.  Compared to the S330, I would buy the S330, but I couldn't afford it when I bought this.<br />The Good<br />Takes great motion pictures - I took a picture of my fan while it was moving, and the picture came out as if it were still!<br />Size - Nice and small, but big enough that me, with larger hands, can still operate it<br />Movie Mode - Don't buy the camera for this mode, but it's a great toy to fool around with<br />Sturdy - Even though it's small, it feels tough<br />The Bad<br />Included CF - Only 8meg card.  That's only about 12 pics.  I bought a 128meg card, which is much better, because I can hold about 100 high res pictures or 200 med res.<br />No Case - The case isn't included, and is selling for [$$], and Canon could have easily included this<br />Zoom - Only 2x.  Not very helpful, but its better than 1x<br />The Ugly<br />Nothing really<br />So, in short, if you're looking for a mid-priced camera for school, work, or vacation that is good for it's size, go for this camera.","I've had a couple of digital cameras in the past. None of them was half as good as s200 in terms of performance and exterior design. S200 has a solid metal case which makes it both rigid and looking good. It is very easy to hold. Yeah, sure it is the smallest camera around but controls are definitely not crammed together. The pictures it takes are vivid in color and simply outstanding in clarity. The LCD on the camera is very clear under bright sunlight. I don't know how they did that but no camera I've seen came close on this. The battery life is also very good. It takes only two hours to fully recharge the battery. And it has Chinese language option! Which isn't really all that important to me but it's a plus I can use my camera in my own language. Overall this is a amazing buy. I have countless gadgets and this is certainly one of the most satisfying. The only con I can think of is the price at futureshop for this camera. Cheers.","i brought and reviewed this camera three weeks ago. here's the update. AMAZING!!!<br />i go out three nights in a row without charging and it still takes pics...with flash. it has actually never died on me. and i pound this puppy. gone are the days of my dissapointed semi-narcasistic friends who i can't show them the pics right away for fear of the dreaded \"red battery light\". i am only too happy to show them the shots..and the zoom function where you can zoom the image.<br />this camera is everything i wanted. small. easy to use. automatic and manual, great features for even a pro user. but above all this little guy has AMAZING picuture quality. even at 8x10. clear, with no \"digital coldness\".<br />It really is time to make the switch and this camera will make you beleive in technology again! one comment, spend the cash on a matching Canon printer that prints direct. wish i did, but then again i do have iPhoto with OS X.2.<br />to end: a VERY happy camper.","I bought this camera only a little time ago and it has been my dearest pal. It is so easy to use and the options are simple to read so that even a primate could figure out how to increase or decrease the picture size. The movie format is exceptionally, it makes it better because it has a microphone. The USB2 connection makes it attach to the computer. The software that comes with it is interesting for people who don't have programs such as Adobe Photoshop. The battery has quite a lot of juice. Be sure to recharge for more than 4 hours (do it while your sleeping), for a good 2 day or more use. This camera and package comes with everything one would want.","After the numerous positive reviews on both ... and various camera sites, I went ahead and picked up a S200. I've managed to get some good pictures with it, but it definitely is not a good camera for someone looking for a \"point and shoot\" device. Careful composing of each shot is required, as is tinkering with the various settings and modes.<br />For example, on my first outing, I took it to a large aquarium in Chattanooga. When I returned, I realized that only 1 out of the 16 shots I took was excellent; 2 other ones were pretty decent, and the rest were garbage. Not great for a supposedly \"point and shoot\" camera.<br />On my second trip, I spent about an hour with the manual, learning the intricacies of auto focus lock, flash lock, various metering modes, and other features. If I spent a minute or so on each shot, carefully determining the best mode for the situation, my results were much better - 6 out of 8 shots were excellent.<br />If you want a camera for a vacation where you want to snap something neat that you see as you pass by; say, out of a gondola, while on a train, etc - I'd say forget about the powershot s200. If you are looking for a camera to produce excellent \"set-up\" shots, this may be the one you're looking for.<br />Pros:<br />- Great picture quality and color - if you're willing to<br />  compose the shot extensively.<br />- Rugged, fine-looking stainless steel<br />- comes with a li-ion battery pack & charger - good battery life<br />- menus are easy to navigate through<br />Cons:<br />- photos that are \"point and shoot\" are likely to come out blurry or improperly exposed, to the point of unusability.<br />- Camera does not take Compact Flash Type II cards - only Type I<br />- No uncompressed file mode - if you do any cropping / editing on your picture, expect it to get worse each time you resave it.<br />- Focusing is very picky in low-light situations<br />- Price is pretty high for a 2 megapixel camera<br />- lower resolution modes are practically useless; only the \"best\" resolution setting gives quality pictures.","I bought the S110 in December 2001 and have become a digital camera maniac. I really love this camera and have recommended it to my friends. The quality of the photos and its small size have won me over. The S200 has some of the improvements that I wish my S110 had but it is still a great camera. I have an extra battery but have only had to use it a couple of times. I charge my battery every day when I am travelling. The rechargeable battery is really a blessing. It is so convenient and quick to charge. Sometimes I wish it was a 3 or 4 megapixel camera but I'll have to wait for Canon to develop that in the future. I took the camera with me on my two plus week trip to France and took over 350 pics. That meant buying an additional 128mb card in addition to the 128,16,8 and 64 I already owned. It was barely enough. The camera worked well in low light situations(no flash used) when we wanted to photograph some of the paintings we saw on our museum tours. With a steady hand most came out pretty well considering the slow shutterspeed necessary for that kind of lighting. Where this camera mattered the most to me it through with flying colors on this trip and I was very happy with the photos of our trip.<br />The primary reason to buy this camera is its small size and good quality photos. I carried this camera with me,usually in my pants pocket, 90% of the time I was in France. I barely knew it was there and I didn't stand out as a tourist.  I do find myself longing for a camera with more features and more megapixels but would I take it with me as much as I do now? I think not.<br />I do get a few unsatisfactory photos, but I think it has more to do with using the light well and setting the camera's light settings appropriately. I'm still learning how to use it.<br />The video feature is really wonderful. It gives short clips with so-so resolution but you can be creative and catch some wonderful moments, especially with children.<br />i would recommend the canon s30 or s40 if you can afford more and size is not a factor in your decision.  These are very highly rated cameras.","I love this camera!  I needed a new digital camera, and my primary criteria were that it take great pictures, be very rugged, and be as small as possible.  I love taking pictures, but you can't take them if you don't have the camera with you.  I got the Elph so I'd be able to always carry it around with me.<br />There are no compromises on the image quality either, it takes some amazingly good photographs.  Max resolution is 1600x1200 pixels @ 180 dpi (my old Kodak digital camera took 1192x864 @ 72 dpi).  This means you can print 5x7 and 8x10 pictures without any problems.  The highest quality setting on the camera with the lowest compression gives you about 1 picture per megabyte, so you'll need to get a 128 MB compact flash card as soon as possible.<br />Anyway, I LOVE this camera!  I carry it around with me everywhere and take pictures of whatever I see that looks interesting.  My other digital cameras were too big to take with me for casual use, this one can go anywhere.","After some years of carrying the bulky 1.3Mpixel Sony FD-88, I got older and tired so I bought the much smaller 2Mpixel Canon S200.<br />I had the 2 cameras side by side taking some test shots to compare the pictures. I also alternated the center frame and AI auto focus modes on the Canon. I found out that the pictures taken by the Canon were noticeably \"not\" as sharp as those taken by the Sony. Canon's engineering is not as good as Sony, IMO. Even the sliding [mode] switch on the Canon bothered me, they had the [movie mode] between the [photo mode] and the [review mode]. The ergonomic order should be [review][photo][movie].<br />Avoiding the hassle of returning a mail order, I gave the Canon S200 to my 10-year-old nephew, he was not as picky as his uncle and would not care much about picture quality.<br />Meanwhile, I continue shopping for another camera, likely another Sony.","This is my first digital camera, and I must say I am very impressed. After just returning from a weeks vacation, it performed without a hitch. The compact size, about the size of a pack of cigarettes, and metal housing make for a very portable unit. I usually just slipped it in my pocket, leaving the battery charger and cables behind. I upgraded to a 256 flashcard, which is highly recommended. We took over 200 pics and 2 videos with sound and there was room to spare on the card. A nice feature is the cable that plugs into any video jack on a tv set. I was able to play back a slide show each night of the pics we took that day without use of a computer. After returning from vacation, it was a snap to burn the pics to CD-r and send them off to friends, or just e-mail them. I found the camera easy to use, but you would be foolish not to completely read the manual. I found that fine tuning the settings made for better quality pics. And the resolution of the pics is very very good; they display beautifully on a computer monitor. The video mode with audio is also nice, however picture quality does suffer. I never had any battery problems, I simply recharged the battery each night. Considering a spare is about 50 bucks, you should buy the camera first, then decide if you really need a spare.<br /> My wife is a camera buff, and she also has nothing but high marks for this fine product. With the computer software, battery charger, battery, USB download cable, TV cable, and 8mb video card all included, the only additions you really need are a small case (to hold everything) and a larger video card.","les cuento que quede maravillado con la camara ya que es pequeñisima ademas de las variadas funciones y espectacular nitides en las imagenes y peliculas yo la recomiendo por sobre todo ademas de su sencilles de manejo y alta calidad en su presentacion .<br />el cargador de bateria que trae es muy versatil ya que se puede ocupar con cualquier voltaje en USA: o Sud America y Europa","I bought my S200 at the beginning of June and I LOVE it.  The main reason that I bought it was that it was very compact, and I wanted a camera that I could take in my pocket, because I hate carrying around bulky items.  In the month and a half that I have had it, I only had to charge the battery TWICE after the first charge.  Although it is said to take four hours to charge, I found two hours usually does the trick.  Yes, you can downplay it because it only has 2 mega-pixels, but I bought this camera so I could take pictures when I needed.  As an average person, I don't need a four mega-pixels camera for vacation snapshots.  Still, I think the quality for 2 mega-pixels is awesome.  At the largest resolution and smallest compression, I think the picture quality is as good as the higher mega-pixels cameras.  The zoom isn't the greatest, but my digital zoom shots turn out crystal clear.  Canon is a brand that I could trust, and it is high quality.  But what I love is the size.  Lengthwise it is the same size as a credit card.  At only 6 ounces, it feels like very like when I carry it in my pocket.  The LCD screen is bright, and the playback mode is very simple.  I only have a few critisisms which are: 1) The movie mode only lets me take shots for a few seconds, and I don't know why. 2) The 8mb card is nothing!  Buy a 128mb card, because it will store a lot of pictures.  All and all, this camera is a great buy for anyone.  If you are looking for a quality camera that is simple to use and easy to handle, buy the S200!","I bought the S100 as soon as it came out and loved this little camera for its great picture quality, very small size and robust build.  Its small size in particular allowed me to take it on many trips and take thousands of pictures.  I upgraded to the S200 also as soon as it came out, and was very pleased to see that Canon significantly improved it over the previous model.  Menus and navigation are now much more intuitive and usable.  The continuous zoom on image review is very nice.  The overall camera speed is improved.  The motion-JPEG mode is a wonderful toy, with near-VHS quality results.  When people see it, they want to get it for themselves too.","I wanted small size and a great picture.  This has it!  You know bulky cameras on vacation are a chore to carry, many times you opt out of taking it with you.  I wanted a no-brainer solution for this dilemma and found it.  Great Picture quality, great color, ease of use and intuitive menus.  Sure it's *only* 2MP, with only a 2x Optical Zoom, but easy trade-offs for what I was seeking.  I bought 2-128MB CF cards, a CF card reader and a spare battery for lots of pictures and no hastle with connecting the camera to the computer.  Shop around for price, you don't have to (and should not) pay retail!","don't get this if your looking for the best quality<br />slr is the way to go for that<br />This camera is compact... very easy too use... didn't even have to look at the manual to figure out all the functions<br />a couple of things to note<br />probably should get a spare battery and a nice case as recommended<br />Um to improve picture quality  put it on the highest resolution and lowest compression<br />you don't want it compressed that much<br />i was disappointed with the picture quality at first but when i turned the compression to the lowest setting and highest resolution<br />there was a drastic improvement<br />good luck with your purchase<br />lotsa fun highly recommended","The main purchase decision when compared to other cameras of a similiar (+/- £100) price, was size and looks. The ixus is significantly samller than most similiar quality cameras.<br />It may be useful to have one of the swiveling LCD screens, but the balance is that this will fit in your pocket.<br />The features on the Ixus are very quick and easy to understand, it has easy control of white balance, and easy to learn menu sytems for setting up prefernces ect. the zoom control is right next to the shutter release which is very handy.<br />The software which comes with the ixus seems to do the job just fine, and really is pretty straightforward to use.<br />The 8mb card which comes with the ixus is enough to get started with and allows 25 - 30 medium quality pics.<br />Battery life is pretty short, but i guess this is the norm with digital cameras, the neat laittel charger does its job more than adequately.<br />I can see an upgrade to a bigger memory card and spare battery coming up in the near future.<br />The quality of images is excellent, very sharp with brillinat colours, and theres plenty of creative settings to play with, its fairly easy to create professional quality results.<br />All in all a very satisfying purchase.","I carried an S100 for a year and a half, having concluded at the time that size was key -- after using some ... cameras (like the Largan L-mini, 640x480 w/flash) and getting useful but not great pictures, my primary consideration was that a digital camera needed to be small enough that I could carry it *all* the time, so I could capture pictures of interesting things without planning.<br />Note that this is not the right approach for everyone - deciding how you'll *use* a camera is a personal choice.  If you don't think you'll take pictures in every day life, but just on vacation... or if you need to take pictures for work... you may find that size isn't key, and you may be happier with a larger camera (though I'd recommend other Canon models in that case, including the 330) or a cheaper one.<br />However, if you're like me, and want to capture the world around you, but in good enough quality to get 8x10 prints of the *really* good ones... if you want to have a camera that fits in a pocket so you don't look like a tourist all the time... this camera merits a good look.<br />When I say \"worth upgrading\": I loaned my S100 to a friend shortly before the S200 came out.  130 pictures/day later, my friend had to have one, so I took another look at the S110, which seemed a fine replacement -- and then the S200 came out, and I had to have it.<br />Features that make the upgrade worth it:<br />  video clips (long enough to be interesting; not only is this good for catching cats and trains, there are also cases where you can't get a clear still shot but someone looking later will get more out of a short video clip) *with* audio<br />  better low light support (both automatic and manual settings down to ISO400)<br />  anti-redeye flash option<br />  ROTATION SENSOR (worth shouting about - it's so nice to just rotate the camera for framing, and have the results come out properly tagged.)<br />  better (2- and 3-zone) autofocus/light level sensing<br />  on-screen histogram for low-light shots (lets you tell if you really got nothing, or if you can pull out more detail in post processing)<br />  \"view pictures\" mode lets you zoom all the way in, allowing spot checks for blurriness directly on the camera.<br />  New batteries are 25% more powerful.<br />I'm quite pleased with it;  I've taken 700 pictures, 100 movies, and 4 panoramas, in the two months I've had it (and 1500 pictures and 7 panoramas with the S100 before that.)  Note that the panoramas are worthwhile - you just want to make some effort to set them up, rather than try randomly.  One was an \"all guests at wedding reception\" panorama that I got printed as a 6 foot by 6 inch strip, which made a great christmas gift to the couple :-)","I've had my S200 for three weeks now, and just had to post and let others know this is a great camera. This is my first digital camera, and after much research, I'm pleased to think I got exactly what I needed.<br />Pros:<br />- Sturdy! Portable! I work at a summer camp and wanted a camera I could take around with me and not worry about. I've already dropped this camera several times (pretty hefty drop once) but the metal casing is sturdy enough to take abuse. As always, be careful, but you won't have to worry about breaking this camera. You also won't have to worry about lugging a huge camera around and having to set it down everywhere. Shorts, swimsuit, whatever - it'll fit in your pocket.<br />- Print Quality: I got my first ofoto.com order the other week and the pictures look GREAT. I was worried that 2 mpxls wouldn't be enough, but even the 8x10 I ordered came out fine. Make sure you have a large memory card (I have a 128 mb one) and take pictures on the best possible setting.<br />- Good battery life: I've seen some bad ratings on this, but don't know why. I take lots of pictures and always use the LCD screen. With that usage, my battery lasts from about 7:30 in the morning until 11:00 at night. I just come home and charge it each night. If you turn the LCD screen off (and the camera off when you're not using it) it will last longer - I've used it for two days straight before charging it. Extra batteries are relatively inexpensive, so get one if you can, but you can always get one later and still enjoy your camera.<br />Cons:<br />- No case. You really need a case. I've gone caseless for three weeks now and there is a lot of lint inside my viewfinder (but no other problems). The Canon paperwork is a little confusing about which case is designed for the s200 (get a case designed for it - it's too small to fit anything but a made-to-order case), but check powershot.com to find out which one to order. It's a cheap way to protect your camera for a long time. Buy it online, too - I'm having a hard time finding a case in a store.<br />- ZoombrowserEX. The software program that comes with the camera to organize your pictures and take them off the camera is not designed well. Windows don't pop up right, and it's easy to permanently delete some of your pictures (no recycle bin).<br />- Slow. With the red eye reduction flash setting, it takes _forever_ to actually take a picture. Even the autoflash function is still slow. With plenty of light there's no problem, but the flashes tend to be a little slow (although, if you prefocus, there's not as much of a wait). Don't buy this for sports photography.<br />-Uploading old images. I've had problems with taking pictures off my SimpleTech card and then putting them back on. Half the time the pictures are squished or streched, especially portraits. I'm not sure who's at fault for that, Canon or SimpleTech, but it makes it annoying when you want to share images with your flash card.<br />Overall an excellent camera. I'm very excited about it and would recommend it to anyone who wants portability and great pictures. I picked the s200 over the s330 because of size (the s330 looks a lot bigger). None of the extra features on the s330 made up for the size difference.<br />I tried to cover all the bases here. Hope this review from an amateur photographer helps.","I've had the camera for a little over a week now and it is everything you've read about it.<br />The only flaw I've encountered is...a lack of a battery indicator on the camera.  Since the camera requires its own rechargeable battery, I'd invest in an extra battery and an AC adaptor; reasonably priced and worth the avoidance of anxiety.<br />I recently used the camera to take many pictures of the University of Texas tower lit orange in honor of the baseball championship at night.  THe night settings were easy to understand and set.  It was slightly difficult to take the pictures without a tripod and avoid the blurs....not unlike any other camera (digital or 35mm).  I've found the software included to be use to use (although large @ over 20 megs) and the quality is superb.<br />At this price and size, there is not another camera in its league!","My wife and I were fed up with the costs of film and then developing the APS pictures. The last vacation was the final straw ans total film costs for the vacation came to 60 bucks.  I did a lot of research and narrowed my choices to the S200,S330 and S3.  I looked at the S3 because I promised my wife that the new digital camera would take as good as a picture as the APS camera.  But the 3 meg pix was still kinda pricey so the S200 and S330 were the finalists.  The cameras from what I read are the same except for the 3X zoom on the S330. I didn't really use the zoom on my APS camera so we bought the S200 off of amazon.  Soon as ups came I started to charge the battery.  In the meantime I got familiar with the camera and read the docs.  Canon did a great job of a quick start guide and the detailed book was more than I really needed. about 1.5 hours later the green light came on from the battery charger (nice feature to let you know it's finished) and powered up the camera.  After setting the date and setting the pics to the highest resolution and super fine compression I was ready to go.  Point,shoot and view.  It was really that easy.  I was able to view the slide show of images I took and I erased the pics I didn't like (that pays for itself being able to erase the pics you do not want).  I also bought the viking 64 meg cf card and HP 100 Photo printer with this and I can't believe the photo quality coming from this little HP 100 printer.  The S200 takes as good if not better pics (settings are on high) than my APS and then the kicker was I pulled the CF card, inserted the CF card into the HP 100 (doesn't require a computer to print) and printed a 4X6 borderless pic in under 2.5 minutes.  We both laughed, cause you can't imagine the quality.  Side X Side with a APS photo you can't tell the differnce.  Took the little printer and S200 to work snapped some photos and printed them off and I get the same disbelief from everyone.<br />PROS: small compact, rechargable battery, able to do video out to tv, usb to pc, incredible pics, no more film costs!<br />CONS: got to get a 64+ meg card with purchase (8 meg card isn't enough)<br />For [more money] get the HP 100 printer and you won't be disappointed...","I've had my Canon S200 for a month. I have 3 main problems with the camera. #1- The Zoom. 2x zoom is just about like having no zoom at all. Forget the 2.5 digital zoom, it makes the pictures too fuzzy. #2- It has problems in low- light situations. I often have to use photo editing software to brighten up pictures. #3- The display is not very clear.<br />For the same amount of money, I wish I had gone with the Fuji Finepix 2800. It has the 6x optical zoom with a much clearer display.<br />With that said, it is a very small camera. Slip it in your pocket and no one has to know that you're a tourist. Also, the video with sound is very cool. With a 128 MB card and up you can store many video clips (up to 60 seconds per clip depending on what you're filming. Complex backgrounds such as trees will eat up the time quicker then if you were videoing sky). Also the software that comes with the Canon is very easy to use and the video software is neat too. I've heard people complain about the battery life but I took a whole weekend of videos and pictures with the display on without having to charge it.<br />So it boils down to: if you're looking for the small size, go with the Canon. If you're looking for zoom in the same price range as the Canon, go with the Finepix 2800.","This is my 2nd digital camera, as I moved up from HP C200. This camera will do everything you need to do. 8x10 are great quality. The 4x6 is of lab quality on highest resolution. This camera is probably one of the most energy efficent camera. If you hate buying aa batteries this is the camera for you. You will need to get a bigger flashcard. I have a 128 mb flashcard. I can get 96 highest resolution and highest compression photos.<br />I will not need to get another camera for quite some time, and am very pleased with photo quality","I have been a dedicated digital Elph user since the first S100 was released and have really gotten my money's worth from that camera. It is a rock-solid, 2 megapixel, 2X optical zoom, pocketable digicam. It was not, however, a perfect camera, and the first update, the S110 attempted to address its major shortcomings, most significantly by fixing the poorly designed power switch and by adding a movie function. Next came the S200, which added to the movie function (60 seconds max., with sound) better battery management and higher amperage and several new user controls. It did *not* add the anticipated 3 megapixel resolution, nor improve upon the 2X optical zoom. The series continued with the S300 & now the S330, and these indeed do offer the 3X optical zoom (forget about digital zooms; they're nearly useless, especially in lower resolution cameras), though not the 3 megapixel resolution (this is important *only* if your intention is printing enlargements greater than 8\" x 10\"). So with all 5 of the digital Elphs still widely available, which would suit you best? Personally, considering their prices graduate only slowly, and given my experience that a better optical zoom makes for a more useful camera, I'd go for the ... S300. However, if size is not a major factor in your decision process, skip the premium one pays for the Elphs' compactness and consider the fact that you can buy other digicams that are only modestly larger but rather better equipped for less money.","I researched this topic to death and finally settled on S200 because of size.  I use a Palm Vx and use it a lot due to small size...figured the same logic works for a camera.  All the positive reviews are correct.  Here are the problems:<br />1.  Battery life indicator shows up when there is no life left, so you never know if you should charge before you leave the house.<br />2.  CF Card capacity is not indicated anywhere either.  How do I know how many pictures I have left in the card?<br />3.  Red Eye reduction works sometimes.  I use PictureIt Express to remove red eye many times.<br />I have an HP 970cse printer and I can print spectacular 5x7s and 8x10s if the photo is saved in hi-res mode.  If you use Windows NT on a laptorp, get a PCMCIA Compact Flash card reader for 8 bucks!<br />If you are still in analysis/paralysis mode, get this camera now and end your pain!","I've had my PowerShot S200 for almost two weeks now, and I enjoy it quite a bit.  The automatic features make it easy to use for a beginner like myself.  The software setup was simple.  The picture quality is great, even when the subject is only a few inches away.<br />Be warned that, contrary to the Amazon.com review, you cannot add audio clips to still pictures and you cannot record a movie for more than about 25 seconds.  (I notified Amazon of these inaccuracies, but they haven't corrected the listing in over a week.)<br />I recommend getting a carrying case (not included) and a 256 Mb memory card.  For Amazon.com's low price, it's worth the extra few bucks to be able to take 400+ hi-res pictures between downloads to the computer.<br />Also, to save batteries, I'd recommend leaving the LCD display turned off (hit the DISP button twice) when in picture-shooting mode.  Just use the optical viewfinder instead of the LCD when you're taking the picture.  (You can still see the picture for several seconds on the LCD after you take it.)  If you keep the LCD on, the battery goes in a few hours.  Unfortunately, there is no \"low battery\" warning.","This replaces all my other cameras. This sturdy, pocket size digital camera takes amazing point and shoot instant pics, and has a plethora of options you can set on the small, but high quality digital display. Sensitivity, color depth and resolution are great for high-quality prints up to 5x7. Available light pictures are very good if you hold the cameras steady while shooting. Flash images tend to have strong reds, but correct easily with any digital image processing program, including the one supplied with the camera. Don't forget to set your printer's paper and color Properties. Set the colors to match your monitor and it will be much easier to make any minor corrections to the exposure and color of each print.","I just got this camera a couple of days ago and I love it already. The size is perfect, can fit in a pocket, small purse or pack. Picture quality is great! Good for posting on the internet or printing -- I went out and bought a new printer (the HP DeskJet 5550) and the prints are amazing! I'm putting my 35mm camera away and using the ELPH exclusively.","I have the original Canon Digital ELPH, the S100...and over the past year-and-a-half, it's been great!  The pictures are, for the most part, perfect (I ran into some problems in Vegas, where the contrast of the dark, night sky & the obnoxiously bright neon seemed to confuse the CCD and resulted in some dark, out-of-focus shots).<br />This camera fulfills my two most important requirements: 1) high resolution, so that I can print out photos and have them look like they just came from Ritz Camera, and 2) small size, so I can comfortably carry it in the pocket of my jeans...I hate having to hang a camera around my neck and look like a tourist when I travel!<br />I do have a couple complaints, which hadn't been addressed in the S110, and most likely haven't been fixed in the S200 either:<br />- Greater control over shutter speed: there is some control over shutter speed, but it isn't enough to really take any artistic pictures or nighttime landscapes (such as a city skyline at night, which is what I was trying when I discovered this shortcoming).<br />- No battery life indicator (just a low battery symbol, but by then it's too late).  It would be very handy if the Digital Elph could display the minutes of battery time left, or even a small bar showing the approximate amount of battery life remaining.  In my opinion, there's nothing worse than suddenly having the low battery warning pop up (with the S100, this means ~5 minutes until total shutdown).  If you want to see what I'm talking about, I would suggest checking out a Sony Cybershot digital camera (or any Sony InfoLithium-powered camcorder).<br />Other than these two issues, I LOVE this camera...it's definitely more than proved its worth.","I took me a while to decide between this camera and the PowerShot S330.  I prefer the S330 for the way it looks and feels and for the fact that it allows to manually set the shutter speed.  I also like that feature that allows you to add voice memos to pictures taken.  The reason why I decided for the PowerShot S200 in the end is pocketability.  Although the S200 isn't much smaller in terms of inches, it feels a lot smaller than any other digital camera I have held in my hands so far.  I have had the S200 for a week now, and I just love it!  I had it with me almost everywhere I went.  It even fits into a shirt pocket without feeling too heavy!  That was my main reason for buying a digital camera anyways, I wanted to be able to bring it with me wherever I go.  The picture quality is o.k., as long as you don't zoom in too much they are fine.  I only store my pics on my pc and email them to people once in a while or post some pics online.  If I would want to make prints, I'd go for a camera with more megapixels.  But for prints I have a trusted Canon EOS 600 35mm.<br />For the PowerShot S200 I also bought a small carrying case that clips on my belt as well as a spare battery.  I'm also going to buy a flash-card reader.  Oh, and of course I bought a 256MB Compact Flash Card.  So, it was quite an investment, but I love this camera, and it's size is just amazing.","This is in addition to my other review of this excellent camera.<br />I forgot to mention the accessories for this,<br />1. Get one or two extra Canon NB-1LH batteries. This is the most important thing will need one a long day. (Don't get the older NB-1L, it had 25% lower capacity).<br />2. Get a Canon PSC-100 Soft Compact Case for this.<br />3. Spend some money and get either a 128MB or 256MB CF card. 128MB should me enough for most people.<br />4. CF card reader is NOT needed, the USB cable that comes with the camera works perfectly fine.<br />Buy only Canon branded battery/case for this camera, don't try the cheap imitations in the market. Same for CF card, buy only a branded one. Everything is available here on Amazon itself so get these things along with your camera purchase.<br />Ofcourse this is just from my experience and may not be totally true with your case !","I just got this camera from amazon a few days ago, and so far I LOVE IT!  It's really tiny (no bigger than a credit card) but built really sturdy so you don't feel like it's going to break if you accidentally happen to drop it.  It's perfect to carry with you everywhere.  The LCD screen is really nice with the new anti-smudge technology.  The screen looks \"snowy\" under low light, but I really don't mind too much...the pictures come out great!  The camera does get warm after some extended use, but that should be normal for such a compact camera.  The video mode isn't extensive, but a great bonus and fun to play around with.  The ease of use makes this a great first digital camera, but the variety of control settings, such as adjusting the ISO and effects mode, also make this camera suitable for those who like to be more creative.","This ultra-compact camera has excellent image quality in a tiny package. Perfect for that trip you always wanted to take.<br />I use to have a Fuji Finepix 2600z and this one is much smaller (granted, Canon has a smaller zoom).<br />The LCD panel is very sharp and bright and you can see it during a very sunny day, a major plus.<br />What I liked:<br />-Ultra portable<br />-Very stylish stainless steel design<br />-Excellent color reproduction<br />-Great for closeups<br />-Outstanding low-light shooting capabilities, for all those nightime pictures! (please use a tripod)<br />-Fast battery charger (about 2 1/2 hours for a full charge)<br />-Excellent value for your money<br />What could be better:<br />-Image sharpness was slightly soft-looking (is that a Canon thing?)<br />-Average battery life (about 3 64MB cards)<br />-Small flash does not have a lot of power<br />The best thing about this camera is not only that it delivers great point and shoot pictures (for us amateurs!)but that it is extremely portable and provides a decent amount of experimentation and control via its straightforward LCD menu system.<br />I highly recommend it.","Just got it today... first impression was that this camera is SO SMALL & SLEEK!!! Very light, easily slips into my pants pocket without making a big bulge... takes very clear, sharp pictures... colors are rich and accurate... can't wait to try nightshots... The movie mode is pretty amazing too... takes movies at 20fps and good for emailing to friends and family... well worth the price!!"]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S330 (Digital IXUS 330)","amazon_reviews":["This camera works well although not as sophisticated as the more modern versions.I can take photos without a lot of gadgets to worry about.","I've had this camera for at least 4 years.

I can't think of one thing i don't love about this camera.  Virginia","As the title indicates I absolutely LOVE this camera! I recommend it to all my friends. This is my first digital camera and I did A LOT of research before I bought one because I knew NOTHING when I started. Before this camera, I had/have a Pentax Zoom 105R (film) which I absolutely loved and still love. but, I'd been wanting a digital and one main reason was to take it on a ghost hunting tour. (The orbs and ectoplasm show up much better on digitals rather than film for some reason, and you get to see them instantly with a digital). :-) Anyway, the tour takes place primarily at night, and in some dark areas (dark pubs and graveyards) and I'd read that a lot of the digitals don't do well in low light situations. I bought this model because it had automatic settings as well as manual settings so I could adjust for low light. Well, the Canon took FANTASTIC pictures in almost complete darkness! And the pics I took on the tour in Sepia and Black and White turned out really cool!  I didn't think I'd need a huge zoom since my film camera has such a huge zoom. I figured I could just use the Pentax when I needed a big zoom and the digital zoom on the Canon is generally sufficient. I don't use the Optical zoom at all because it starts looking grainy and fuzzy. I think if I was going to buy another digital, I'd go ahead and invest in this same type of Canon but with larger zoom because I've found I never take my film camera with me anymore and sometimes it would be nice to have a little more zoom capability. Generally this camera takes AWESOME pictures in almost every situation. I've compared ease of use and quality of pictures to my friends'cameras and I think my Canon blows them away. It is also small, so it actually fits in my jeans' back pocket. The LCD monitor is a nice size so I use it almost exclusively vs. the viewfinder. The movie/sound function is pretty cool too. I've taken movies of friends skiing, puppies running around and my cat flying thru the air chasing a bug, and they all turned out great. I do have to be careful about what I say as I am filming because the microphone is pointed toward the filmer not the subject, for some bizarre reason. For instance, I've got recordings of \"me\" saying \"Oh crap\" when I goofed up something while shooting a movie. :-) ---- I really like the brushed, silver metal body. I thought it might scratch easily, but 6 months later and there isn't a scratch on it. And it feels solid, so I don't worry about it breaking easily. ----- The software that comes with this camera is excellent!! You just plug one end of the cable to the side of the camera and one end to your USB port and the software automatically comes up on your screen! Once you've programmed it the first time to the folder you want to download to, about the only thing you have to do is hit \"Next\". It is so unbelievably simple! Much easier than what my friends have said theirs are.  --------  The only things that are a little annoying are: 1) the battery cover is on the bottom of the camera directly below the shutter button which means your thumb is usually there to hold the camera. I've found that the cover slides off too easily and when it does, the power goes off. Several times, I've thought my battery was dead only to discover the cover was open. (Luckily it is attached so it won't fall off - and the battery has a little hinge over it so it won't fall out either). ---- 2) The Optical zoom is pretty much worthless because it gets so fuzzy when you get to it. (the zoom automaticaly goes thru the digital zoom settings, THEN to Optical). I just stop zooming when it digital zoom gets to the maximum. --- 3) There is a delay between when you first press the shutter button and when it actually takes the picture. I frequently take pictures of squirming puppies for my mother's website. As you can imagine, I've missed some shots because of the delay. Luckily, it's digital so I can just delete and keep snapping away. Go to [a website] if you want to see examples of pictures this camera has taken. Every picture on this site was taken with this Canon. Note: the pics that appear \"blurry\" around the edges were done that way on purpose with editing software. **** One helpful hint, as everyone else says, go ahead and invest in a backup battery. They are rechargable and the recharger comes with the camera so it's easy to be recharging a battery while using the other. I also bought a 128MB memory card. The camera comes with an 8MB, but believe me, once you start snapping pictures with this camera, that won't be enough. I've shot 128 pictures on the medium quality setting and still didn't use up my card.","This camera works well although not as sophisticated as the more modern versions.I can take photos without a lot of gadgets to worry about.","I've had this camera for at least 4 years.

It is sturdy, does not feel or act cheap, and performs well every time.  We would buy this camera over other digital cameras again.  Some of our friends have less expensive cameras that have broken down but ours is still going strong after almost a year now.  We recharge the battery and did not buy the adaptor.  Instead we spent the money on an upgraded memory card and a soft case to protect it.","I have this camera for over 1 year and I cannot be happier with it.  The photo quaility is great both viewing on the computer and printing them into a photo paper.  Although it maybe heavier than other camera, it's still small enough to fit into a pocket which makes carry around easy.  Setting up the camera to upload the photo to my PC was easy.  I had to install the driver provided when I was on Windows 2000 and no driver is require for Windows XP.  I highly recommand this camera and make sure you get a bigger memory chip when you buy this camera.","I bought the Canon S330 and am glad to say im very pleased with it. It takes great pictures and has great features.  The camera is stylish with a metalic brush finish. The LCD is bright and vibrant unlike some other LCDS on cameras.  The software provided with the camera is easy to use and very user friendly.  If you consider buying this camera you should also get an extra battery and carry that around its very small but is extremely usefull considering the battery life is so low.","I bought this camera about a year back and then gave it to a friend.  Now I am about to buy this same camera again for me.  My only gripe is that you tend to get Red Eyes in many indoor flash pics.  If you are looking for a compact, 2 MP and very easy to use point and shoot camera, look no further.","I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for my son for Christmas.  Both of them love this camera.  I have a Powershot G1 and also generally prefer to use this little one due to its portability.  I recently took it on a cruise and shot over 250 pictures on 2 CF cards.  It is very sturdy.  It fell out of my chair onto a cement floor at a restaurant in Jamaica and survived.  Also used it on the beach with some trepidation but had no problems (but don't get it wet unless you have the waterproof case).  Recommend extra battery and at least a 128 MB CF card.  It fits in my pants pocket with or without the Canon case (also recommend).  The case will hold an extra battery and CF card.  One nice feature is the recessed lens.  With my G1, the lens is always getting fingerprints especially if I hand it to someone to snap my picture, but with the s300 this does not happen, even with the lens extended.  Use manual mode with fill flash for outdoor shots on the beach or boat for great people pics.  Unless you plan to print larger than 5x7 and an occassional 8 x 10 or need to crop extensively due to lousy composition, the 2 MP is fine.  It is nice have the 3x zoom in some situations, but I always try to just move closer when I can.  The great thing is you can snap as many pics as you want and delete the ones you don't like, but I seem to end up keeping them all.  Since you aren't wasting film, take shots of signs, license tags, etc. to tell a story of where you are when travelling.","First of all, I will tell you that I am a 24 year old, with a great eye, but very little photography experience.  This is the perfect camera for me.<br />I recently borrowed my mother's new 4.0 megapixel camera to use, and while it's nice, I am just as happy with this camera!  Unless you are using the camera to make extremely large prints, you really don't need anything more than what the Elph provides.<br />Perhaps my only couple of \"cons\" regarding this product are: 1) the size, it's rather large for an Elph, but even that is a minor flaw, because it is still relatively small, & 2) is that the memory card only allows a few pictures at high resolution, you will definitely want to buy a memory card with more megabytes, but that is simple to do, and you can find one that is inexpensive.<br />All of my pictures have come out with vibrant color, I have even shot some 30 second \"movies\" that came out great as well.<br />The software is very easy to install, and I think that most users will find it as simple to use as home versions of PhotoShop.<br />Overall, a great buy at a great price with very few drawbacks.","Sure, professionals and the exceptionally avid enthusiasts will want a camera with interchangeable lenses, more megapixels, and more features overall, but for its size and ease of use, the ELPH is one of the best digital cameras available.<br />Photos taken at its highest resolution (1600 x 1200) and lowest compression rate can easily be blown up to 8\"x10\" in size, certainly adequate for the average photo enthusiast.  Automatic and manual controls allow for photography in most lighting situations.  The camera even can record short digital videos including sound, and the camera's user interface is customizable with new sound \"themes\" and a start-up image.<br />Highly recommended accessories include a larger compact flash memory card or two; the 8-mb card included simply doesn't cut it unless you want to only take low-res pictures.  Buy a 128-MB card and store over 120 images at the highest resolution; they're cheap these days.  Secondly, you'll want a second or even third battery, as though the camera does include its own rechargeable pack, it will only last for 100 shots or so, and you won't want to waste time recharging when you're on the go.<br />If you want a camera you can carry in your pocket that will give you instant results without having to send off film to the lab for development, you'll want this camera.  The ELPH is one of the best out there!","This Elph packs a lot of features in a small package.  I bought it for it's size.  You could get a digital camera with greater resolution but not in the Elph size.  It fits your shirt pocket.  There is bascically 3 modes of quality for still pictures and AVIs.  The best quality is what I always use and I can still pack in 100+ pictures before my 128MB card is full. The media is easy to swap out with the PC or you can connect it directly to your PC with an optional PCMCIA adaptor.  You can also do a slide show on your PC or TV.  It comes with all the cables.  The camera is rugged and well built.  I like the stainless steel case and it has both a LCD and viewfinder for framing your subject.  The maual mode allows for some control of flash and exposure, but you have to learn the menus.  It's basically point and shoot. The flash, red eye reduction and self timer works well.  Autofocus is accurate, but sometimes has to think about it awhile before shoooting depending on subject and background. The battery life is excellent, but recharging takes some time.  Among the drawbacks:<br />There are a lot of menu choices that you need to learn if you want to get really fancy with all of the modes.  Navigation is fairly simple, but you have a lot of choices. The AVI \"best\" mode will only do a few seconds of AVI at a time.  This isn't very clear by just reading the manual. Don't expect to shoot family videos though.  Just short snippets with audio. The 8Mb flash card that comes with it is a joke.  I recommend buying 128Mb as an add on.  I also recommend a softcase to keep the camera in for it doesn't come with any kind of case.","My S330 replaced my Elph film camera several years ago and since then has traveled all over the world with me. Everything I need to take pictures on a trip can fit into my pocket... including small tripod, charger, adaptor plug, extra Compact Flash cards, extra battery, etc. It certainly beats carrying a camera bag.<br />I make a photo journal after each trip. Since I really don't need to make large prints, the resolution is more than enough. In fact, I know of at least four other people who have purchased this camera after seeing my prints.","Great size, lightweight, really bright LCD, nice 3X optical zoom, and good rechargeable battery life made me buy this camera.  It can fit in my pocket so I'm taking it everywhere.  Some of the on-screen text is small, so if you need reading glasses then this camera may be difficult to work with but I think the majority will find the text to be just perfect.  The S330 has wonderful features, including customizable \"My Camera\" sounds and screens, as well as more powerful tools such as a on-screen panorama composer assistant (to align sequential shots), an AVI movie tool with audio, and more!  The 2 megapixels makes gorgeous 1600x1200 res shots (and smaller).  A wonderful camera at a great price!","I've had my Canon S330 for 2 months now and I love everything about it.  It's solid construction and small convient size means I can carry it with me almost everywhere.  The quick start up and \"shot to shot\" times means less missed photo opportunities.  It is loaded with features that I use only ocassionally, and they are fun but the automatic features do a great job of allowing me to grab quick, quality photos at a moments notice.  I use my Canon S330 on the job and at home to grab photos of my Grand Daughter flitting through the living room in her new formal.  An extra battery and larger CompactFlash card will add to your photographic experience.","This camera is awesome ... I have never owned a digital camera before, but I am now hooked ... I'll never go back to a film camera ... I ultimately decided on the smaller, more compact, Canon Digital Elph S200, and returned the S330, but both cameras are incredible ... I like the smaller size of the S200, and the 3x zoom feature on the S330 isn't as important as I thought it would be (remember: both cameras have a digital zoom that magnifies the built in zoom, if necessary) ... The real differentiators, in my opinion, are the smaller size of the S200, and the \"sound\" feature of the S330 ... If you want something small, go with the S200 ... If you want to be able to \"hear\" your video clips, go with the S330 ... Either way, you're getting a great product!","The S330 is a well constructed and relatively easy to use digital camera (and it's really small, too).  It has a good set of features (e.g. video connection for slide shows on a TV, easily expandable memory by purchasing a higher capacity compact flash card, 3x optical zoom, etc.).  I definitely recommend getting at least a 128MB compact flash card and a spare NB-1LH battery to make life a little easier.  Beyond that, Canon provides all the needed cables and accessories.<br />I've found only two real shortcomings of the camera:<br />1) Autofocus is slow to react in low-light (e.g. indoors).<br />2) 2 megapixels is a little low if you want to heavily crop your images later.  You may want to consider the S230, which has a 2x optical zoom, but with 3 megapixels.<br />Bottom line:  The S330 is a very good camera for the price.","The S330 is a well constructed and relatively easy to use digital camera (and it's really small, too).

(digital zoom ....)<br />- Size-wise it was too small. I couldn't take pictures with one hand and holding it with both hands was kind of awkward.<br />So I settled for the s330 instead because it had both features that I thought the s200 lacked: more zoom and a little bigger.<br />i really don't see the need for the voice memo and speaker but I paid the extra money anyway.<br />Both cameras are worth the money.","...I finally came to choose the Canon PowerShot S330 for its features and specs. I love this little camera! The pictures are amazing and vibrant--more so than the Mavica (1.3 megapixels.)...I've also gotten use to using the view finder rather than the LCD screen--the battery lasts quite a bit longer. By using the viewfinder, I feel more like a photographer. I found, however, that you really have to get in close for the subject to fill the frame...","but for some reason. now I want s200 or s230. compactness is so addictive. help!<br />BTW: 3 times zoom doesn't come out crispy clear as 2 times or no zoom. so I avoid zooming in all the way when I take photos now.(yes, I have do have digital zoom turned off)<br /><br />everytime I pass by shalves displaying s200, I just think it's cuter and so much smaller. fits in pocket better without bulging so much. thinking to myself, I should've invested in smaller casing than extra zoom that I don't use.","I am extremely satisfied with this digital camera. Personally, I like tiny little cameras that I can carry around evey day and Canon Digital ELPH is the best for this function. Since there had been so many reviews, let me just point out what I like this camera most and some of the downsides.<br />Pro<br />1. 3X optical zoom. DON'T purchase a camera with an optical zoom less than 3X, it's useless. This is one of the camera with the highest optical zoom availble. Not even the new ELPH 230 have this capability.<br />2. Very bright LCD and long battery life. I have tried at least 10 different digital cameras and this LCD is one of the brightest. Easily seem even under sunlight. And I can fill up my 128MB card withought recharging with normal LCD usage.<br />3. All metal!<br />4. Great manual functions for a small camera. I can easily take night and indoor pictures by increasing the exposure time.<br />Con<br />1. the macro mode is limited compare to other camera in the same price range. You cannot to close to the object.<br />2. comes with 8MB card!! Can you believe that?!<br />3. only 2MP. It is plenty for my need but 3MP seems to become the main stream these days.<br />All in all, I have taking a few hundred pictures with my S330 and the quality is excellent. Definately worth the money.","This was my first digital, and a wonderful introduction to the world of digital photography.  I'm sure I've taken more than 10,000 pictures sinceI got my S330 last spring, and I've recommended it to three friends who have bought the same camera.  I routinely put my travel photographs on line, and the reviews have been very positive.  The camera has proven to be durable and reliable, and I'm totally hooked on digital photography.  I kept my old point-and-shoot film camera for the first few months after I went digital, but have since given it away and never missed it.  It's all digital, all the time for me.<br />On the plus size, the camera is very compact (easily fits into a pocket), easy to use, and takes good quality pictures.  It also has a very wide range of manual adjustments to increase the flexibility of your picture-taking, and the controls are very well thought out.  The LCD display is very high quality, bright and sharp.  I carry it with me everywhere, and wind up taking many pictures I would have missed with a larger camera.<br />There are some quirks and weaknesses I do need to point out for this camera.  Color reproduction is uneven, depending on the quality of the light and weather, and on the color and type of subject.  Many of my outdoor photos, particularly those taken on overcast or cloudy days, have a noticeable \"cast\" to them ... bluish or greenish.  This is despite fiddling with the manual settings for \"overcast.\"  The camera loves red (you should see my pictures of the barns of coastal Maine) but hates green.  I have never been able to take a picture of a lawn or tree that is anything near true to life, again despite attempts to adjust the manual settings.  On bright days, again despite working with the manual settings, highlights are inevitably blown out (although I hear this is a problem with most digital camera).  In addition, the flash is no more than could be expected from a compact camera.  Flash pictures always look ... well ... flashy!<br />When taking digital photographs, you'll tend to take many more pictures than you would with a film camera, and erase the ones you don't like in the camera.  So I'd recommend at least one additional battery (I have two) and 256 MB memory card if you're going to be doing travel photography without access to a computer to download the photos as you go.  (I get about 360 pictures at highest resolution from a 256 MB card,)  More tips:  digital photography is MUCH easier if you have a Mac (it really is as easy as they claim in their ads to download and edit pictures); Adobe's Photoshop Elements 2.0 is incredible (and an incredible bargain), and Shutterfly.com is a great site for ordering prints.<br />I've got my eye on a 5 Megapixel 8x zoom for early next year, but I'll keep my S330 for its compact size and ease of use.","I did about three months of research before I settled on this camera. Photography is a hobby of mine, so I had been eyeing digital cameras for awhile. The MAJOR contributing factor that got this camera in my pocket was just that. It fits easlily into most pockets. I personally carry my camera around in my front jeans pocket. Family vacations, hockey games, just out around town. If you dont have your camera with you, you are not going to get the shot.<br />My other camera, a 35mm Canon, is not what I would consider a large camera, but I would tire of dragging it around in the Smokey Mtns with the strap either around my neck or around my waist. I would have to leave it on the platform at amuesment parks. But, with my Digital Elph, I just slip it in my pocket and off I go! The controls are easy, the pictures are great, and the construction is wonderful. The case is metal, so it feels to me as if it could take quite a beating.<br />I would highly recommend this camera to anyone from just getting into photography to a serious hobbiest.  I do think that for anything over hobbiest you should go with a bigger, more professional series with more MegaPixels. 2 is good, itll get you an wonderfully clear 8x10, But for any needs over that, youll need a bigger camera.<br />Overall, this is an awesome camera, with great style, contruction, and performance. And like I said, if you dont have your camera with you, you wont get that picture.<br />Oh, and I seriously recommend purchasing at least a 128 MB memory card, and an extra battery. The 8MB card that is included gets you about 20 shots, while the 128 gets around 100 (depending on the settings). Also, while I have never ran my battery out, even after a full days worth of use, you cant just pop into any gas station to grab some full batteries. Other than those two items, you should be ready to rock right out of the box.","I was relunctant to get a digital camera for several years, because I wanted something that was comparable to the automatic 35 mm and APS cameras I was used to using.  WOW!  I guess that is the simplest review of the Canon PowerShot S330.  I just got mine yesterday and couldn't put it down.  There are tons of features.  I had no trouble figuring things out (great manual) and the picture quality at 4x6 was nearly identical to film cameras I have used in the past.  Perhaps the greatest advantage of the digital camera is that you don't need to shoot 24 pictures, then only use 4.  Being able to preview shots and print only the ones you want is great.  The portability of the S330 speaks for itself.  It really does fit in your pocket.  It is also very sturdy.  One of my friends has a PowerShot from last year and like the repositioning of the buttons on the S330.  It feels like a 35 mm camera without the film.  For quality, manual control, and lens selection, nothing beats an SLR.  For your everyday shooting (including quick videos), this is a great camera.  Every review I read for this camera was excellent ).  The only thing I wish it had was a 3.1 megapixel resolution and a bigger card (I would recommend the 128 MB).  Here at Amazon, this camera is a great deal!","The Cannon PowerShot S330 is my first digital camera. I had it for about six weeks so far and I just love it. As a result of getting this camera, in the past six weeks I've taken more pictures at family events then probably the last 6 years combined using conventional cameras. To me, the best thing about digital photography is the instant feedback. You can see your picture as soon as you take it. And if you don't mind wasting some battery, you can use the LCD screen to frame your shots so every picture comes out exactly the way you like it. And downloading the pictures also makes things easy.<br />Basic Features<br />The camera is capable of 2.0-mega pixel resolutions and it has a 3x optical zoom lens and 2.5 digital zoom. The camera is small, I would say a little bigger then a cigarette box and fits in your hands or pickets easily. Both the front and the back of the camera are finished in metal so it weights a little more then other cameras but not to the point where it is heavy to carry. The S330 also comes with a very bright 2.5\" LCD screen in the back. Even in direct sunlight you should still have no problem seeing the screen. With the LCD screen on all the time, I estimate that you should be able to get about 100 to 150 pictures depending how much flash you use. The S330 doesn't come with an AC adapter kit so when you need to recharge, you have to take out the battery and put it in the special battery charger that plugs directly to the wall jack. I thought this was kind of awkward but has since gotten use to it.<br />Advance Features<br />The PowerShot S330 is very easy to use as a point-and-shoot camera but it also has a number of advance features like shutter speed and ISO settings if you need it. It also has a number of white balance controls which helps compensate the different lighting conditions such as fluorescent, cloudy and etc. I've tried to use this features a couple of times but haven't quite master it. I would imagine that most people would never need this feature but if you are a tweaker, there should be enough options in this camera to keep you satisfied.<br />Besides the regular camera like features, it also has a movie mode and stitch assist mode that are interesting. The stitch assist mode is for panoramic shots and it's best to do this with a tripod so at the points where the pictures are stitched together, the object wouldn't look warped. The camera does not stitch the pictures, that process is done separately when you connect the camera to the computer. The stitched pictures will have a stitch line linking them together indicating that these pictures were shot in stitch mode. Clicking on the stitch line would launch the software program to for the panoramic picture. And you can stitch as many pictures together as you want.<br />The movie mode is something I've only used a couple of time. The camera stores short film clips and it limits how long you can shoot depending on the resolution of the film. The clips are limited from 10 to 30 seconds and in 640x480 resolution (which is the largest), it would only record for 10 seconds and not 30.<br />Pictures<br />In terms of the quality of the picture, I am pretty satisfied with it. Sometimes the picture is a little soft around the edges or kind of fuzzy but that's not every single time. The color of the photo is decent but IMHO, not 100% true to life. There are quit a few pictures I've taken the found it to be too red or yellow. But most outdoor shots in daylight that looks just wonderful. The flashlight packs a big punch for something so small. Anything within 8 feet is no problem at all in dark situations. The focus light has a slightly shorter effective distance so sometimes the camera can't focus so when you push the shutter and nothing happens. This is kind of frustrating but just try to take a few steps closer to your subject and it should be fine.<br />Just about every picture I take with this camera, I take it in 1600x1400 resolution and in fine mode. This way, any pictures that I like I can have it developed and look just like it was taken from a conventional camera. In this largest format, the photo is about 1MB each. So with a 128MB compact flash card, you can still store plenty of pictures. Unfortunately, Canon only provides a 8MB CF card with the camera so make sure you buy a CF card if you don't already have it. Also, because of S330's small size, it is only capable of accepting Type I CF cards and not Type II. So like IBM's 1 GB MicroDrive is not compatible with this camera.<br />Issues<br />Maybe I've missed this in the user's manual but I have yet to find a battery meter that shows me how much juice is left in the battery. When the power is running low, the camera would just shut down with very little warning. I guess Canon just didn't think this is a critical issue since the pictures are all already saved in the memory so advance warnings on the battery running low is pretty useless. But just be prepared and the best solution is to have a second battery so you can just switch it when one runs out.<br />For such a well build camera it's very disappointing to see the cheesy flap it uses to cover the USB and video ports on the side of the camera. Not a major issue though.<br />Canon did not include any bag or pouch for the storage of this camera. Even though the camera is small enough to fit just about anywhere, the metal finishing is brushed and can be easily scratched. A soft pouch would be perfect to protect the surface but not included so protect your investment and get one on your own.<br />I am not going to complain about the 2-mega-pixel limit because it's more then enough for an average user. A well taken 2-mega-pix pictures developed on 4x6 film would look no different than if it's taken on a 35mm camera. So don't buy more then you need because the higher the resolution, the more memory it needs and more time it takes to save a picture. So take a closer look at the Canon PowerShot S330 because it might be just what you're looking for....","This is by far the best camera for the buck.  It is very easy to use and still has lots of features to keep a techie busy.<br />If you have a small child, this is the camera for you, it is easy to operate with one hand so that you have one hand free and the pics are wonderful and will keep the grandparents happy.<br />I have not used it, but another plus is that if you buy certain canon printers, you can direct print.<br />If you are in the market for a great camera, go with this one, it is by far the best in its class!","Just got my Canon S330 last month and has been taking countless pictures with it.  Great camera!  Have a good amount of manual options that you can play with.  With enough light, it will take amazing pictures, for a 2MP camera.<br />It does has some issue with low-light conditions, however.  My dad has an Olympus digital camera which does a much better job in low light.  Probably because it has much bigger lense (bigger lense = more light gets to the CCD).<br />But there's no way I can take a bulky camera like that Olympus around like the S330.  So, a little give and take.  Over all, I'm very satisfied with it.  Just have to know it's limitation and how to work with it to get great pictures in any situation.","The Canon S330 is a nice camera for outdoor photography. Real easy to handle and gives you great pictures even without reading the manual. Pictures are nice and sharp and colors are vivid. Software installation (on Windows XP Home) was a breeze and camera communication with the PC was seamless. My complain with the camera is indoor photography though, especially flash photography. The flash range is fairly limited and the edges of the photograph tend to be dark. And with the camera zoomed out to 3x, indoor photography is next to impossible without a tripod or flash. It has a lot customizations I could care less for (My camera settings). Overall, I would say that the S330 is a cool camera to own but for the slightly more serious photographers, the 35mm SLRs still rule, if don't mind carrying a lot of gear that is!","After reading many of the customer reviews along with doing my own research I finally decided to purchase the Canon S330 and received it about a week ago from Amazon. I am delighted to report the postive reviews on this camera are right on! I know very little about digital cameras, downloading photos to PC, printing photos etc., but I was doing it all the same evening I unpacked it.  The photos I have taken are great; the clarity and colors are amazing! All procedures are clearly explained from start to finsh.  I have Windows 98 and downloading the photos from the S330 goes swiftly without incident. I also purchased the recommended (good advice) Viking 128MB Flash Card along with an extra Canon NB-1LH battery pack. I will get plenty of use out of the camera simply because it is fun, compact, easy to use, and I can view and print the photos whenever time allows. No more running out to buy film, batteries, get the film developed, or pay for photos that didn't turn out well. I also purchased the Canon MultiPass F30 Printer/Scanner/Copier which I am very pleased with as well. Taking pictures during the holidays is going to be a snap.","This is my first digital camera, and after checking many models, I chose th s330. I've had it for a week now, and have taken pictures and movies and downloaded them onto my laptop. I love the clean, compact design, the controls are easy to pick up, and the software set up was quick. I'm no photography expert, but the pictures look great. There are just enough features on the manual mode (exposure, ISO, white balance)that it gives you plenty of control without overwhelming a non-expert like myself. It's more than enough for any recreational user. The great thing about a digital camera is that you can take a bunch of pictures to try out the various manual controls without wasting film. Haven't tried taking night shots yet, though.<br />As many people complain, the 8MB flash card is tiny, but it makes sense to me. The 8MB is just big enough to get you set up before you buy the bigger memory. Sure, 8MB does nobody any good, but who's to say that the buyer will want a 128, 256, or a 512MB card? Let's say a 128MB card is standard. If I wanted a 512MB card, I would feel stupid paying extra for a card I wouldn't use.","Great cam. for being socially active/outdoorsy (ski, camp, bars,etc)<br />BUT, it has a few too many bells and whistles for me right now that I never use. Couldn't find some of my needed features, however, in the lesser models so I guess I can live with these unused luxuries and maybe learn them too...<br />I do find it a bit slow on getting ready to take a flash picture in the dark as it has to adjust, in an almost \"automatic\" way that you wish you could more readily override, thus making your subjects wait a bit longer than they'd expect. (Hold that smile, everyone!) You have to almost hold down--as if to force--the button in order to finally get it to take a shot. I have had to re-press the button at times, and could miss action that a simpler point-and-shoot digital might have gotten. I have often decided to turn on the camera, instantly click certain settings to turn off the flash, and snap pictures without. I can often adjust them using Photoshop on my home system.<br />In skiing, I like to try to get friends doing jumps or other active shots, and so since this is mostly in the daytime, you dont need a flash and the cam does not start up forcing you to use it. In order to now get those \"perfectly timed\" shots, you can, with the S330, teach yourself to carefully \"half-press\" and the camera is now, in contrast to the above, sooo itchin' to take an instant shot that any jiggle at all could do just that, so be ready! (the little lights will flash as you stand alert...) Now when you finish pushing down the button , it snaps on command which is awesome because you can say, \"I got you jumping in mid-air!\"<br />Bought online a second battery (definitely recommended) but it was made by Optex (NOT recommended) because it empties in no time! I will buy another Canon --only.<br />To save power, I also often instantly turn off the display (although you get a more centered shot when using it to frame subject) which comes on as the default (I like cameras that it does not come on as the default).<br />seems as though the cumbersome software CD does not work with windows 2000ME, but maybe I should try reinstall a 4th time...or go with USB cards and reader. (that would give me more ease in travel)<br />In the end, it is the compact size, pic quality and style of this cam I like best. I can live with having to work around the other things and so it is great, but not as easy as say, an Olympus, to hand to someone else and say, \"Can you just take a picture of me?\" I guess I gotta do a lot of stuff at home with Photoshop to many of my pictures later.","picture quality is awesome as everyone has mentioned. unlike some people pointed out that flash is somewhat weak, it takes awesome photos in complete dark.<br />good: movie mode is just perfect for creating 30 second 320 x 240 clips ready to upload on the internet. unlike camcorder, you don't have to go through the hassle of capturing and convert to internet friendly file. software comes with the camera transfers everything in CF card to harddisk automatically and you could upload files straight to geocities for your friends to view them across the country.(BTW: 3.5MB file per every 30 second clips it creates. it's 30 seconds at max PER SHOOTING regardless of CF size. you can have many 30 seconds clips stored in your card but you can't shoot 40 seconds straight because after every 30 seconds, there is 3 second delay while writing information to CF card. don't get confused you could start up a internet broadcast with this camera like 30 minute show.)<br />Manual option is really fun to work with and it creates professional looking photos. (take a picture in really dark room, perhaps with single candle light, set long shutter at 15 seconds exposure. you will get amazing soft looking photo).<br />bad: in movie mode, light exposure is fixed to the point when it starts capturing. in other word, if the light condition changes darker or brighter in the middle of shooting, you will only be left with audio and white or black screen. (it does not adapt to new surrounding while shooting)<br />ugly:what am I suppose to do with 8MB flash card now?!?!?!<br /> psc-300 bag is perfect fit for this camera. I really had heck of time getting hold of it. I finally order it from gateway accessories online after driving around all over the town. It really should've come with the camera in sake of protecting LCD.<br />don't forget to get an extra battery. have fun.","I just wrote a review on this super camera, and forgot to mention the battery charger.  It is very compact, lightweight  and easy to carry along on trips.  It fits nicely in a small camera bag, along with the camera, so it should be easy to make sure you never have a problem with a \"dead\" battery.  Plugged mine in during lunch at a butterfly fest to make sure I didn't miss out on any great shots.","I've had this camera only two weeks, but I LOVE it.  Was able to unpack and start shooting pictures right out of the box without using the manual (and I'm not even an engineer!).  Pics at a butterfly festival came out unbelieveable, and inside shots have been excellent.  Wonderful people shots with excellent skin tones.  So far I've only used \"auto\", and haven't tried the \"movie\" mode yet, but am looking forward to trying out all the bells and whistles.<br />  I bought an extra NB-1LH battery, a Card reader (which is a must, in my book), and a 128 card.  Planned to get the adaptor when it is in stock, but with extra battery and quickness of downloads with the card reader, I don't think I need it.<br />  This camera is so easy to hold, and fits in your pocket so I am taking it with me to lots of places I wouldn't normally lug a camera to.  It's ready to shoot almost instantly, and ready for the next shot very quickly.<br />  I was on the point of buying the G2, until I read so many reviews about the camera freezing up -- decided not to take the risk.  I do wish this was 3 megapixels, as the name sort of implies, and that it had a higher optical zoom -- but I can't cut my rating for those options as I knew what was offered when I bought the camera.<br />  The Zoom Browser software has worked well, tho I have hardly had to touch any of the editing features as the colors have been wonderful.<br />  I'm very happy with this camera and highly recommend it.  I purchased from Amazon and while I could get it at a slightly lower price at eCost, by the time I factored in the free shipping with Amazon it was a better deal, plus I had the option of returning the camera if not satisfied.  If you're looking for a great, small 2MP camera, this is the camera and site to buy from!","This is easily my new favorite toy. Not only does it take unbelievable pictures, but there are so many options. I recently took it on a trip to some glacier caves in New Hampshire and shot some great photos. Neat part is, there's a sound feature that lets you record about 30 seconds of sound and attach to each photo. So you can really explain just what each photo is and save it as a .wav file. There's also a movie feature that lets you record about 30 seconds of moving action with sound. What's really amazing to me is the quality of pictures in a completely dark room. The flash does wonders! For a 2MP camera, this Elph is so worth the money.","I got this camera a few months ago along with a 512meg flash card. It has been a wonderful camera. The flash card it comes with is a bit weak, but thats to be expected. Get a 128meg or 256meg card. I got a 512, but its way more than most people could use. I rarely fill it up, and I take the highest quality pics I can.<br />I use the camera to take pictures of things I build, modifications to my computer, and stuff like that most of the time. It gives me very nice, very sharp pictures that look great.<br />I also take some picture of my 6 and 12 year old cousins when I visit my grandparents. The small videos you can take aren't amazing, but they do let me remember some nice things.<br />My cousins loved to let me take short videos of them. The built in speaker on this model is great for replaying the video when you are out somewhere.<br />One thing that this camera has the the lower PowerShots don't have, is a 10x zoom on camera after you take pictures. On the little LCD screen I can zoom in very close to make sure I got exact details focused and everything. This works wonderfully. I used my dads old S100 and it doesnt do this, and it was annoying to use after I used this camera.<br />The size and feel of the camera is great. This was one of my major reasons for buying it, after its wonderful image quality and options. The one problem I had was finding a good case for it that was very small and light, and didn't stock me from taking it out quickly. Any cases I found to buy for it were to large.<br />I have had no problems with the software or anything. The battery life is also great. I thought it wouldn't be to wonderful, but I have never ran out of batteries at a critical time. Although I do wish the camera could warn you when you are about to loose battery power much eariler. If you act quickly you might be able to upload the pics to your computer, but not normally. A battery meter would help a lot..<br />I do suggest getting a second battery if you plan to use it for long periods of time.<br />This camera may not be the best for everyone, but for someone who needs nice quality pictures (but not the best), in a nice looking, easily caried form, this works great.<br />I have never seen another camera that looks and feels so nice. Its just gives it that high tech feel that impresses everyone when they see it.","After a long search, I decided on the PowerShot S330 based on extensive reviews on the quality of the image. It is an excellent 2MP camera! Minolta had an ultraslim 2MP, but avid digital camera viewers have said that the shape does not compensate for the poor image quality. As I have come across other 2MP contendors, the ELPH shape is by far the best. Shortly after I bought the camera, Konica came out with a slightly smaller 3.34MP (Konica KD-300Z) for about the same price. However there are few reviews and little product information available... The s330 has the cool Elph shape, is slightly thicker than its predecessors, but has a solid feel to it.<br />A few items of note to guide the (first-time) shopper based on 2 months of use:<br />1. BATTERY. Battery life is very good. I also bought a generic NB-1LH as a back up from SterlingTek; it is purportedly 800mAH, versus the Canon brand 840mAH and previous Canon NB-1L (680mAH)that first came with the s330.<br />2. MEDIA. Bought a 256MB TypeI CF card, and can now get ~256 photos at the highest resolution (vs. the 8MB that comes with the camera). I rarely take that many pictures at a time before a download, so there is also much room for video clips. Being the TypeA that I am, I also bought an extra 128MB at a good price that may come in handy when traveling for tourist-type photos.<br />3. MOVIES. The movie clip quality is as others have remarked, only satisfactory even at the highest resolution setting. (I almost do not notice a difference between settings). However, the clips do include SOUND and provide a TON of ENTERTAINMENT! The files are already at about 3MB size. It would be difficult to share larger files. (For better quality, one should consider a video camera.) The clips are best viewed at about the size of the 1.5\" LCD screen. *DO* remember to record in landscape format (!) as you cannot rotate the clip for viewing.<br />4. DOWNLOADING. The software and USB cable method appear to work well. Although downloading directly from the camera will consume batter power, I don't feel compelled to by a CF reader or an AC adapter since I have the extra battery. Others have remarked on the flimsy rubber cover over the A/V out and digital out and speculate that it may not last the life of the camera.<br />5. IMAGES. The images are excellent. If they turn out substandard, you may be able to clean them up w/the accompanying software. If you're good with the manual settings, you can probably get the quality you are looking for. Definitely comparable to my old 35mm; and I don't see a huge difference from a friend's 3MP (Canon Powershot S30).<br />6. LIGHTING/OTHER. The camera has excellent compensation for different lighting (natural, cloudy, flourescent, tungsten, etc.) Alternatively, you can adjust this manually.  The Elph line appears to have problems with red-eye reduction.  Others have remarked that the red-eye reduction setting is less than satisfactory.  Thank goodness for software editing (on CD that comes with camera).<br />7. ZOOM. I think a 3x optical zoom is a MUST for a 2MP camera. Turned off the digital zoom, as I don't want false hope of having quality zoom at the purported ~7.5x total zoom. The zoom is actually slightly better than my old 35mm.<br />8. OTHER MANUAL FEATURES. I've always been a point-and-shoot user, however, there appear to be many manual features that offer a lot of flexibility. I suggest practicing with these features, e.g. exposure, white balance, shutter speed, iso.<br />9. CASE. Doesn't come with camera. I bought the Canon PSC-300 case which has a small hole for the wrist stap to pass though and may be worn on your belt. I tried the PSC-20 case.  It was just too large for me, I could also stick the USB connector in the bottom.  I picked up a cheap case (under ten dollars) by Lowerpro which fits like a glove!  It has a zipper pouch without the annoying velcro flap-over of the PSC-300 and PSC20 that would stick to my wrist strap.<br />I have to admit a bit of \"pixel envy\", but the 2MP and seems adequate for most of my cropping/enlargement needs, and printing 4x6s to 5x7s, possibly 8x10s. 3MP will likely provide more cropping/enlargement options considering the current optical zoom limits. My criteria were size and image quality for approximately three- to four-hundred US$. When canon comes out with a 3MP I will consider upgrading when the price comes down to current s330 prices.  (Since my original writing Canon came out with the s230--I'm not totally sure which I would buy at this point.)<br />If you're looking for a compact 2MP camera, the s330 is the ONE for you!<br />Update... i just bought the s400.  Love the new processor, smaller size, and 4MP.","I just got the camera a week ago.  I was taking some photos around my house and decided I needed more to shoot.  I went to the zoo and I could not believe the pictures this camera took.  I just pointed and shot(all in auto)  When I got home and downloaded the pictures I was blown away!  Now, bear in mind I was using the highest setting (but with an extra battery and a 148 Flash card I didn't worry about it)  I never had to change the battery the whole day.  I had got images I didn't even think I could.  I can't wait to take more pics.  I even went as far as to buy the underwater case for the camera, so I guess I have to hit the wave.","I normally shoot with an Olympus 3040 digital which has all the bells and whistles that allow 35 mm style photos. But I have missed numerous potentially great photos because I didn't have this somewhat larger camera with me. I wanted the Elph for about a year, but didn't get it due to short battery life and the 2-megapixel limit. The S330 uses the NB-1LH lithium ion battery (which can be used on older models too. After reading the reviews of the new S-330, I bought the camera. I haven't taken many pictures in the few days I've had the camera, but took some outside and a couple indoors. I printed out a 5X7 outdoor shot and was very impressed. The quality of the photo was every bit as good as with my 3-megapixel. Now I have a camera in my pocket ready for those formerly missed shots and I can count on great pictures to at least 5X7's... I also bought the Viking 128MB card, an extra NB-1LH Battery and the PSC-300 Soft Case. I would do it the same way again and maybe get the AC adapter for time hooked to the computer or for learning the camera better. The case is good but has a pocket that accommodates the charger and battery, so it is a little large for a jean's pocket. The ZoomBrowser software that comes with the camera is much better than I had for file storage and printing layouts. File naming, moving and printlayout are easy. I still use Photoshop Elements for my image editing and haven't tried the image editor that came with the S-330. A camera is a bit like a life jacket: it doesn't do you any good if you don't have it on you. If you want a camera that you will have with you, you will like this camera.","I wanted a digital camera that was compact, easy to use with a good zoom capability.  This camera is superb.  A turn of the dial allows easy movement between picture taking and viewing.  The downloading is easy.  The camera plugs directly to the usb port so no flash card removal necessary.  The battery pops out and has its own tiny charger which charges it up in less than 2 hours.  The camera is light and small, easily fitting in a pocket, so easy to carry top baseball games, and any events where I don't want to carry a backpack or purse.  I love it.","I had a difficult time deciding between the S200 and the S330. After reading numerous reviews on websites, I finally chose the S330. As a college student, the price made me cringe a little but I figured that paying for the 3x Optical zoom will be better in the long run. After owning it for about two weeks, I can claim that it is small enough to fit in my purse and takes beautiful pictures. The reason why I only gave the S330 4 stars is that the camera did not come with a bigger memory card or a camera case.","A lot of people say this is a great camera but a little too pricey. I say this is a great camera at a great price. Sure there are other 2mp cameras that are a little cheaper but after using this one and its predecessor the S300, the others don't compare in overall ease of use, speed of use and quality of construction.<br />Although this camera can still give you better results with a little tweaking, the automatic settings are better than almost all others in this price range. And of course this is one of the most Pocketable cameras out there. Don't get me wrong there are some very cool manual features on this great little camera. My favorite is the slow shutter control. You can set the shutter to several speeds from 1 second to 15 seconds. And the camera comes with built in processing to eliminate hot pixels (those bright spots that appear on most long exposure digital pics). I have used this several times always with good results.<br />Overall there is little to complain about with this package. It comes with a good battery for general use, good software, all the cabling you need to get going and even a fairly well written manual. If you are planning on using this on long trips where you will not have access to an electrical outlet very often, then you will want to get the extra battery. And I highly recomend the Canon PSC-300 Case, it is perfectly sized for this camera and still has room for extra memory and battery.<br />Do yourself a favor and get a Viking 128MB compact flash card. The reviews I have read tell me this is the best memory for the dollar. Very fast and very cheap.<br />...These are bar none, the best digital camera reviews on the net.<br />Buy this camera and enjoy!","I am an old-school, amateur (hobby / relaxation now)  photographer (Canon F1, Mamiya 645, and a 4x5 View camera) 35mm to  large format.  I did not have the funds to get an interchangeble lense digital.<br />I had taken a few photographs with friends Minolta, Kodak, HP, and Nikon digitals.  The S330 is definitely above them. I would have given the S330 a blazing 5.0, but would actually rate it a 4.5 do to size of my hands vs. the size of the camera and the LCD size( glad I wear reading glasses) and the spot effect of the flash from a distance.<br />I shot a 12 exposure role of Kodak Gold Ultra ISO 400, after metering off of a gray card and keeping that exposure setting and compared to the same photos with the S330.  The S330(on auto) was a little underexposed in the shadows, but not enough to not compensate with a competent graphics program.  Landscape photographs out the van window at 60 miles an hour were good. There was some blur, but if you lead the shot as you would in shooting skeet, it was acceptable.  Color was acceptable in all cases(not like the overt blue when shooting ektachrome.<br />When I ordered my camera, I also ordered a 32 meg and 256 meg CF card ( Simple Tech cards and Flash Link CF card reader ).  I strongly suggest the average user to order a supplemental 32 or 64 meg CF card when they order this or any other digital camera.  I just ordered a spare battery and will order the car battery charger and AC Adapter kit in September.  The low battery feature should give an obnoxious warning, but it does not.<br />I have had no problems with the software that was included with the S330 of the CF Card Reader (running windows 2000).  Strongly recommend this digital camera, as I have been well pleased. Point of note: READ YOUR MANUAL.","I've had this for a two weeks now.  I selected the Canon for its small pocket size and 3x optical zoom.  I keep it in my shirt pocket for immediate accessiblilty to photograph items and places at work.  The S330 is not as slim as I wanted, but I chose it for its 3x optical zoom over the S200's 2x optical zoom.  The all stainless steel exterior is a work of art.  A little heavier and bulkier than I wished for, but the controls are simplier to use than my Nikon Coolpix 880 and the LCD display superior to my Coolpix 880.  The tripod socket is not centered on the axis of the lens but is located at the far leftside.  Sweet little camera.  Somewhat bulky for my shirt pocket, so I ordered the Canon PSC-300 Soft Compact Case.  Images are good to excellent for a 2 megapixel pocket (sorta big pocket) camera.","This camara is perfect for people who want performence but don't want to carry a big camera.<br />Outstanding quality pictures. Comes with everything you need to start taking pictures right away.<br />The only thing I don't like is that it lets you record only 25 seconds of video clips.<br />Totaly Recommended.","I was extremely pleased to begin my digital experience with the Canon S330.  The pictures were great, and the camera offered such ease in use.  A friend of mine suggested this camera, and I had used his camera to take some family shots before purchasing one for myself.  Anyway, I speak of the camera in the past, because shortly after using it, I started getting an E18 error on the screen.  I have returned it and am now wishing that this camera had worked for me, because of the options it offered, ease of use, beautiful pictures, and especially it fit into my price range.  I don't enjoy buying a new product and find it mailfunctioning shortly after the purchase.","This camera packs an amazing array of features into one of the tiniest packages you can imagine. The image quality is also outstanding, considering this camera's size. Although slightly larger than its cousin, the s200, this unit comes with a full 3x optical zoom rather than the s200's 2x optical zoom. And it will still fit unobtrusively in your pocket. The build quality is great, too. The whole camera feels like a solid piece of finely crafted aluminum and stainless steel. I was very impressed and you will be, too.","A lot of fun playing around with the 330; I really like being able to connect it to my TV during a party and showing a slide show. Sounds can be associated with taking a picture or turning on the camera; you can download your own sound files. I shopped around a lot and all the camera's have some problem. The battery time is about 3/4 to 1 1/2 hours depending on using the LCD and the low battery warning is very short; the zoom is average for a 3X and the view hole is not overly accurate; also the macro feature is about average. But I could find more problems with the other cameras I tested.<br />Overall, my family loves the camera and we use it a lot. Especially nice are the Sepia, Black/White, photo stitching, the LCD is about the best I've seen even looks good in bright and low light, memo feature is cool, the colors are very accurate and the pictures look great, it feels like a real camera not some piece of plastic. And best of all it fits in purse or bigger pants pocket.<br />8/5 I've played with the camera for about 2 months now; in 1028x768 mode with super fine quality I can get 270 pictures on a 128meg card (49.00 Viking Card); I had Wal-Mart print 4x6 and 5x7s and they are perfect; they look better than my 35MM.<br />I'm very impressed with the manual adjustments you can make; from the 50-400ISO to the lighting.  I took a hike in the Adrondack mountains and was able to adjust the lighting to take pictures in the forest.  The movie mode is very good but you can't rotate movies and the 320x200 is so so when displaying on a 35\" TV.  One problem, downloading to my PC is extremely fast, about 150 pictures in 2 minutes but sending pictures back to the camera is painful at 10-20 seconds per picture, ouch; also you can not send AVIs back to the camera.<br />Still a great camera.","I wanted a compact digital camera, so after much research I settled on the S330. This is a great camera that is well built and takes great pictures. I wasn't sure if 2MP would be enough for me, but so far it's great. I wanted a camera mainly for family pics and travel. I was using a point and shoot 35 mm Nikon with a zoom and I wanted to go digital. To me, the S330 takes just as good pictures. I usually don't print over 8x10, so I can crop pictures and print them out on my HP printer and they're beautiful. The camera is easy to operate and it fits in my pocket (but a bit heavy). I have Windows XP and the software installed easily and I have had no problems with it.<br />I have a 128 meg CF card that works well. I usually shoot on the highest resolution and the battery lasts about as long as it takes me to fill the flash card. Recharging is very easy.<br />So here are my:<br />Pros:<br />Small, portable and built very well<br />Easy to use with manual mode of various settings<br />can take cute video clips<br />Shutter lag is not bad<br />Takes great pics<br />3X zoom is nice and quick<br />Love the ability to review pics on camera and magnify 10X to check detail and quality<br />Cons:<br />video clips not the greatest quality and very short<br />sometimes my indoor pics aren't in sharp focus<br />sometimes it seems camera won't focus quickly (indoors)<br />Camera is a bit expensive for 2 MP<br />Overall, I highly reccommend it! It's easy and fun to use. Good luck!","I wanted a compact digital camera, so after much research I settled on the S330. This is a great camera that is well built and takes great pictures.

Good luck!","What this camera can do is truly amazing.<br />The photos are very well done with good focus, exposure, etc.  It allows you to exercise your creativity to an extraordinary degree.  The panoramic stitching software is superb.<br />I have taken more than 120 photos at a time and still had power to spare.  You should get a large memory chip (128M or 256M) because the 8M is only good for 12-16 fine quality photos.<br />Of course, it is a 2MP camera so you should not expect 13x19 prints but 5x7 or 8x10 are just fine.  Panoramics are truly impressive - an 8x36 of New York City is stupendous.<br />I am delighted with this in every way.  It has exceeded all my expectations.","The model has many great features. I am going to point out two areas where I am disappointed for your reference:<br />1. I have 3 computers with different operating systems: Win98, 2000, and XP. First I noticed that the camera couldn't be connected through UBS as a remote drive. You have to use the provided Canon software to link it. After several efforts of installing and uninstalling the software, I could only make the Win2000 linked and had no luck with other two. I tried to download the latest drivers from the Canon Website and it didn't help. It is a nightmare to download the pictures.<br />2.  I could not find a way to moniter the battery power level except for the red warning sign when battery is almost gone.","I have the camera for a few weeks now. So far my impression of the camera is very positive. In the sub-compact catagory, the S330 probably have the best image quality (in my opinion). There are some issues under low light conditions. I think you should take this into consideration if you are looking at this camera.<br />1. For example, the auto-focus have a hard time locking under low light conditions. The picture is actually in focus, but the indictator says otherwise. As long as you hold the camera still for long shutter speeds the camera should take a well focused picture under low light conditions. The focus assist light is not that great either, but most other models in this catagory don't even have this feature.<br />2. Not a good camera to take distant objects at night. The flash is too small and weak, but that is a trade off for having a small camera.<br />3. The biggest issue with this camera is probably the auto white balance. If you use the auto mode under artificial light, the AWB feature doesn't work well at all!!! But this can be corrected under manual mode. I hope Canon will have a firmware fix for this.<br />Overall, it's hard for you to go wrong buying this little camera. The image quality is above average. Its size and construction is top of the class. My only real big complain is the camera is too pricy for 2MP. Oh... In addition, 50 bucks for another battery is not that cheap either (you should get one for long trips). 8MB compact flash card is so somewhat useless (only 10-32 max shots depending on the quality). So you probably to have spend another 150 dollars to make the camera \"complete\".<br />If you haven't looked at other subcompacts, I recommend Nikon Coolpix 2500 and Minolta DiMage X. Those are great cameras too, but S330 filled my needs betters than those two. Cannon S30 and S40 are great, too (suffer the same low light problems <- from what I heard).","I would like to rate this camera with 5 stars, but there are a few features that I miss.<br />1)No battery status. I have not yet found a way to find out how much battery is left at any given time. The camera suddenly alerts you when you have about 6-8 photos left to snap.<br />2)No case. Camera does not come with a case of any kind. I would like to protect the nice finish on the camera.<br />3)Problems to transfer the MPEG (the less than 30 second movies) to the computer. The MPEG movies did not automatically transfer to the computer with the rest of the images, not sure if you have to change the settings to do so??<br />4)No power cord. The camera does not come with a power cord, so you constantly have to run the camera on batteries, even when you have it hooked up to the computer.<br />However, I did a lot of research before buying this camera. It's my second digital camera, and I'm overall very satisfied!! The camera takes great pictures, the flash is strong enough at night, and the size makes it fit snuggly in your jeans pocket! I also bought a 256 MG flash card...This is a must!! The Flash Card works perfectly!! I have not yet bought an extra battery. The battery included in the S330 has 30% more capacity then the previous models in the powershot series. I snapped about 180 pictures with a fully charged battery, and when do you really to snap more than that during one day??!<br />I really recommend this camera! It's a go!<br />Good luck!...","We purchased the Powershot camera for the birth of our son.  The quality is outstanding.  It even takes short videos.  The price is unbeatable for what you get out of this camera.  There are so many functions available, but it's not confusing like most cameras.  We shopped around for almost a year and found out that the Powershot was by far the best!  Highly recommended for the everyday user!","I have been a dedicated digital Elph user since the first S100 was released and have really gotten my money's worth from that camera. It was not, however, a perfect camera, and the S300 attempted to address its major shortcomings. First of all, the  zoom jumped to 3:1 rather than the old 2:1, yielding a big improvement in utility. The S300 also added a 30 second movie function, which once you mastered the download process, really added zip to Internet photo apps. Lastly, the control wheel with embedded power switch worked far better than the old recessed power button, which in my mind was a real problem with the S100. Now, the new S330 updates the S300 with better battery management and higher amperage, and adds several new user controls. It does *not* add the anticipated 3 megapixel resolution, nor improve upon the optical zoom. The question now is whether the digital Elph series is worth the premium one pays for its compactness. For considerably less money, one can buy other digicams that are only modestly larger but rather better equipped. Personally, I would say that finding an S110 or even an S300 would be a better approach value-wise for someone intent on getting a camera of this size that is of good quality. I believe the S330 has merely gilded the proverbial lily.","I received this camera 2 days ago and I absolutely love it!  It has a lot of features but is very easy to figure out.  I would definitely recommend this camera to first time digital camera buyers along with a compact flash card reader.  It downloads pictures to the computer faster and without draining battery power from the camera.<br />It's worth it to pay the extra for the resolution and the zoom.  Plus, it's very compact at 3.7\" by 2.5\".  Check it out!!!","All I have to say is, wow!  I've had my s330 for about a month now and I have been nothing but impressed.  I am still amazed at how much this little thing can do.  This camera really is only slightly larger than those disposable cameras many people buy.  It is also quite light making it ideal to carry with you wherever you go.<br />The interface is actually really intuitive with most options being labeled by easy to understand pictures as opposed to words.  I was also impressed by how well it did with fast moving pictures.<br />My only reccomendation at all is that you buy a 128MB card to go with it.  With the extra space you can use the highest compression and size settings for even better looking pictures.<br />The price might be a little scary at first, but trust me when I say you won't regret it.","I bought the S330 3 days before leaving for Moscow & St. Petersburg. Based on reviews read here and at other sites I also bought a 256MB memory card and an extra battery. The basics of operation took about 20 minutes and 15-20 photos of the backyard, by the second day of my trip operation was effortless. The zoom is quite impressive and most pictures were flawless; whether from a boat, through glass, from a moving car, whatever, even an amateur like myself got some truly special photos. I had a 128MB card from another camera and took it with me, a bonus, the memory cards aren't specific to the camera and you can get real cheap memory on-line from secondary distributers or borrow the cards from freinds with other digital cameras. The batteries charge very quickly, and with two I was able to leave one charging at the hotel and the other in the camera, but I could've easily carried both all day - full charge takes less than an hour. I never had any power problems, I also got in the habit of turning the camera off between shots however. Which brings me to my only real complaint, the on/off switch requires sustained pressure for 2-4 seconds, its not usually problem getting the shot you want but it could be - and it was a little annoying. Since I had so much memory I used 1600x1200 and the finest detail for every shot, and I still took over 350 photos and had room for about 75 more. Now that I'm home its giving me all kinds of options for re-sizing and zooming into whatever details I like most in the picture. The picture review setting on this camera is one of its best features, you can actually zoom into the photo you just took to be sure you've got the level of detail or particular aspect of a subject that you might've wanted. I ended-up retaking several photos and getting precisely the picture I was hoping for. I own an older Sony and one of the original Kodaks, and I can't recommend this camera enough. Good Luck.","A friend lent me his s300 for a trip to Spain, and I loved it. When the s330 came out, I bought it right away and I've been very happy with it. It takes excellent pictures, and allows you to change to manual mode for getting more control over the exposure. The new battery lasts longer than the one in the s300, and the user interface for the camera is much improved. They also fixed another problem with the s300: when you take pictures by holding the camera vertically, it's smart enough to display it that way on the LCD screen (the s300 forced you to flip the camera). I would give the camera 5 stars, except that I wish the zoom were better and because some of the manual exposure features are a bit buried in the interface.","I love it!!!  It's the perfect complement to my Nikon SLR camera, half the size and weight.  You need an additional battery [$$$] and 128 Mbytes memory gives you 400+ photos at medium resolution and compression (which is fine for everyday photos).  Pick up the PCMCIA CF adapter [$$$] if you are transfering photos to a laptop and you don't have to deal with any cables.<br />I also found the included ZoomBrowser software very useful to  organise all of \"My Pictures\" on the computer.<br />Bought it in the USA for a considerable saving.  Approx. [$$$] vs. [$$$] in Switzerland.  Even saw it priced for [$$$] in the UK.  Canon distributes the camera under the IXUS product line outside of the USA.  I guess this is how they can command a price 50% higher.<br />Only recommendations for improvement - 1) Better viewfinder (although I only use the LCD display) and 2) Battery meter.","If you are considering the Canon Powershot S330 (and I'll bet you are), you are on to something GREAT!<br />This is my fourth digital camera over the past 3-years.  I have always stuck with Canon digitals because I just think they are the best out there (sorry Nikon!).  My last camera was the Powershot S300, and I loved it.  But when the S330 came out I saw enough improvements to buy it.  And I'm glad I did.  Picture quality is without equal among similarly priced 2 to 4 megapixel cameras.<br />Don't fret about it only having 2 megapixels - when's the last time you had anything enlarged beyond an 8x10, anyway (never, right?).  2 megapixels will give you fantastic results, will allow you to take subsequent shots quicker, will let you store more photos on your compact flash card, and cost less than the 3+ megapixel cameras.  For 99% of you, worrying about 2 megapixels not being enough is kind of like worrying your car's top speed - you'll never take your car that fast, and with the camera, you'll never notice the difference between 2 megapixels and 3 or 4 megapixels.<br />The most important things to me are picture quality and portability - you cannot take great pictures if your camera is left at home.  This camera fills the bill better than anything else out there for me.  I'll admit that Canon's Powershot S200 is also fantastic, but since it only has a 2X optical lens, it just is not as versatile as the Powershot S330.<br />Buy this camera!","Compact size, very handy. Quality is good. Price is little high compare to the other same type product in the market. The one of the useful item which I bought.","Excelent value for the money, great image quality, solid build quality, and many features not found on other cameras. No complaints other than the [poor] image editing software and tiny 8mb CF card included (they should either drop the price and include no card or give a credit towards buying your own).<br />Highly recomended!!!!!","I did a lot of research before settling on the S330 as my first digital camera.  My most important criteria were size and image quality.  I have to say this camera really delivers.  I love the fact that I can throw this thing in the pocket of my shorts and take it anywhere.  I'm not bothered by the weight like some people have posted.  I purchased the 128MB CF card.<br />A must have in order to use the movie feature.  Granted, this is not camcorder quality video.  However, if you want to capture an impromtu moment with your kids, this will be a life saver.<br />The shutter takes some getting used to.  It seems the very first picture you take takes a few seconds (a lifetime) to auto-focus/auto-adjust before the picture is snapped.  Subsequent pictures, espcially outdoors, focus and shoot quickly.<br />Battery life is pretty good.  It seems the picture review feature sucks up a lot of battery juice.  If you don't review your shots you can take 200+ pictures before recharging.<br />This camera is a bit pricey...but if small size is what you want you can't go wrong.","This is in addition to my other review of this excellent camera.<br />I forgot to mention the accessroies for this,<br />1. Get one or two extra Canon NB-1LH batteries. This is the most important thing will need one a long day. (Don't get the older NB-1L, it had 25% lower capacity).<br />2. Get a Canon PSC-300 Soft Compact Case for this.<br />3. Spend some money and get either a 128MB or 256MB CF card. 128MB should me enough for most people.<br />4. CF card reader is NOT needed, the USB cable that comes with the camera works perfectly fine.<br />Buy only Canon branded battery/case for this camera, don't try the cheap imitations in the market. Same for CF card, buy only a branded one...","background:  attended photo school at ICP in NYC, shoot with a canon G2, and previously shot with a canon A2 SLR and a stylus epic fixed lens P&S.  (P&S = point and shoot)<br />i've owned the S330 for about two months now, and have to say it is an excellent camera. -the fact that it is digital is a dream come true because i never expected this kind of image quality outside of film P&S cameras.  interaction with the camera is completely intuitive, and the controls are simple/excellent.  build quality is substantial, sturdy, and very impressive outside the plastic flashcard door (although every camera seems to have one flimsy something or another)<br />the camera offers more features by way of light balance, artistic modes, manual modes and flash combos than the better film P&S cameras out there like the fixed lens stylus epic and the yashica T4.  the lens is extremly fast at 2.0 (?) or is it 2.2?  anyway, it's very fast for a P&S so this gives you better opportunity to shoot without the flash which should be avoided on any camera.  the camera even warns you of camera shake if the lighting is low and the shutter speed is long. very cool.<br />very nice effects can be achieved using differnt metering and focusing techniques..(see photo.net to learn how to properly shoot with a P&S).  add in the sepia, vivid and B&W settings, and you can really be extremely creative with this little camera.  software is excellent, although a bit simple, and i've expereinced NO problems at all using Windows 98se.  flash card reader is not at all necessary.  canon instructin manuals, cables and everything related is excellent as it comes in the box -ready to rock.  BUT, you need a bigger flashcard (96 should do) and a case of some type to protect the lovely metal finish. xtra battery is essential if you're shooting all day.<br />i've been using this camera for going out when i don't want to lug the G2 around. it's size is good, but not great.  the s200 is a good compact size in my mind because the s330 is a hair too big to keep in a jeans pocket, plus its a bit heavy (but in a good way).  this is being nitpicky, but the 3x zoom is worth the xtra size i guess.  the LCD screen is excellent, although the viewfinder only includes about 80% of what your actual image is on the screen -annoying if you're trying to compose a shot through the viewfinder in an effort to save battery life with the LCD off.  on the other hand, it's very easy to fix composition errors in the software.<br />a word on digital.. if you're a photo student, or if you're looking to improve your photography, then BUY a digital camera.  it's free to blast away photos and test different technique, lighting, point of view, composition etc.. and you SEE your results instantly in the LCD.  also, you know if you've blown a shot.  you'll learn much much faster because you'll remember exactly how you shot, when, in what mode etc (all recorded wiht the image).. critical for learning quickly, and you don't need to take notes and burn a thousand frames like with film.","I read reviews, I checked sites, I reviewed prices, I experimented with my friends' digital cameras and it all came down to this little photo wizard, the Canon Powershot S330. This camera has got it all, the ability to point and shoot, and more advanced controls when I want more emotional shots. The best part is that while I'm a total amateur, this camera make me look like a pro. The shots are so nice and clean, crisp and vibrant. I love the ability to take dozens of shots without worrying about film and developing... I have always loved taking pictures, but now the process is so much better with a little digital camera that does nearly everything!","A friend of mine had brought a S-110 Elph to South Africa last summer. I was amazed at that a camera so small could take such great pictures. I bought the S-200, but called Amazon and upgraded to the S-330 before the S-200 shipped. I am no camera buff, but the S-330 is pure fun to play with. I feel I cannot mess up a picture.<br />... Also Stephen Wildstrom in Business Week (4/12/2002) reviewed the Kodak Dx-4900 and Nikon CoolPix 2500, but in his conclusion he came back to his good old Elph s-110 as his pocket digital camera of choice. If you are on a fence about buying the S-330 you will not be after reading these reviews!<br />FYI- I wondered how much the S-330 weighs with the battery and 128 flash card, well it weighs 9.5 ounces.  I was looking at bidding for the camera on [line], but the finally bids were often about the same as the Amazon.com price or even more. Plus I just like to buy from Amazon.","Canon has another winner in its new S330 model.<br />It has the following positives,<br />1. Excellent looks, build quality.<br />2. Great night shots, not found on any other compact 250gms camera, new long shutter feature in manual mode for upto 15 secs.<br />3. Very reliable and tons of features like charger works all over the worls, PAL/NTSC video out, all cables included (unlike Sony).<br />4. Accepts cheaper Compact Flash cards which are easily available in sizes upto 256MB. Not expensive 64MB sticks here :)<br />5. Very much pocketable. Easily goes into the trouser pockets. Slightly tough to fit into jeans pocket though. Look at S200 if you want even smaller camera.<br />6. 2.1 MP may looks low compared to other 3/4 MP cameras but this one offers more features without sticking you with any sticks ! Don't just use MPixels as your sole criteria when selecting camera. If you won't print them bigger than 8x10\" then 2MP should be enough for now unless you have that extra cash :)<br />7. 3x zoom very faster to start and fold back. Works smoothly. You can turn the digital zoom off permanently.<br />8  LCD is superb, pictures look great on the 1.5\" LCD. (a bigger 1.8\" LCD on other need not neccessarily mean better quality, my last years Fuji had 1.8\" and comes no where near this 1.5\")<br />9. Great user interface... think of these Elph's as Nokia's of digicams. Other cheaper camera's out there might not have same reliability, features, user interface and picture quality.<br />Problems,<br />1. Battery... lasts on 120 shots or so...  you WILL have to buy a second one for extra [money].<br />2. The battery/CF doors feel flimsy. There are not made of metal but of plastic which looks like silver colored metal. But this much better than an all plastic one !<br />3. Canon's ZoomBrowser EX software is very unstable. It keeps crashing every few mins on Windows XP. Canon needs to iron out the problems in this. After buying an expensive camera atleast its SW should be reliable ! (Atlhough I haven't encountered any problems downloading pics till now, I don't see any reason to buy a CF card reader, this works fine with the cable, took just 3 mins for 100 big pictures)<br />4. Price is still high for a 2MP camera, although its become much more affordable than last year.<br />5. Movie mode is almost useless because of 5 sec limit on decent sized clip. Its just a marketing thing. Same with the audio/mic on camera.<br />6. Included CF card is just 8MB ! (it costs [money] to get a 32MB card for bulk purchases). Someone has to start including these necessary things like a decent 64MB card along with new cameras.<br />Spend few extra bucks on this cool camera and you won't regret !","I bought the first Elph that Canon offered years ago and have enjoyed using it. Lots of features in a very compact size. So when I started to look for a digital camera Canon was my first choice. While there are other cameras with more features, etc., the S330 does exactly what I need it for. Images are clear and the camera is easy to use. I have tested out all the features yet, but when it comes to point and shooting you are up and running without even reading the instructions. Definitely recommend this to the average user.","This is my first digital camera....it is so easy to use, even I can get good pictures...........upgraded the card from 8mb to a viking 64mb card through Amazon special..............The S330 is a smidge larger than the the other elph cameras, so I find it very easy to manipulate....very satisfied..........","I've been looking for a really good digital camera for a decent price for quite sometime now.  I've been searching & researching. I finally decided I wanted a Canon Elph because of it's size, the 2.1 megi-pixel and the zoom.  So I searched for prices and they seemed a little more than I had wanted to spend.  But then when I found the S330 on Amazon for only a little more then the older models, I bought it.  When it finally came in the mail, I immediately starting playing with it and reading through the manual.  I found out it did much more than I even really knew!!  I was really glad I bought this camera, and I'm going to have so much fun taking photos!  Batteries in all the digital cameras are going to go fast, mine lasts about 1 to 1 1/2 hours on, just make sure you have an extra.  I like the effect on the camera with the black & white and the Sepia look.  A 128MB CompactFlash card is a good size for this camera.","I have been searching for a digital camera for over a year now.  I have been close to buying many.  Including Olympus, Sony and Kodak.  None of them offered the portability and durabilty and yet maintained the picture quality I needed.  When I saw the s330, I finally realized what I had been searching for... Great picture quality, digital/zoom, extremely portable and durable.  Not to mention 2 megapix is way more than enough unless your thinking of starting a professional photo career.  The pictures come out spotless everytime... Just shoot and put it back in your pocket.  Another great feature is the battery charger... completely foldable in one piece.  No cord involved, just plug directly into the wall.  This is the ultimate travel package!  Not to mention the additional speaker over the s300 model and the lower price tag, you have a winner here.  Upgrade to the 128 MB card... I am averaging over 400 pics a card on medium resolution!  Happy shooting friends!","... I am a novice to be sure, and hemmed and hawed for months about whether to go digital or get a regular film point-and-shoot. I'm very glad I got this camera, and it takes absolutely stunning & lovely outdoor shots; however I'm a little bummed at the efficacy of the red-eye reduction feature. Many of my indoor evening shots of friends look as if they were taken at a Satan worshipper's convention. I suppose I can clean this up in post-production, if ever I figure out how to do that, but I wish this feature worked better.","I've had this camera for about six months.  I'm a pretty critical person, and I love its picture quality, portability and build quality.  Its great for taking on short hikes and its taken a couple of decent shocks without incident.  The movie mode is cool. Its very small, but trades better zoom than the s110 for a slightly larger, heavier unit. For most people, the slightly larger size won't matter. Its the difference between a camera that changes the drape of your suit jacket and one that doesn't. Unfortunately, there is not sufficient warning when the battery is almost worn out, so that you may miss some shots as a result of not having enough juice left.  Last but not least, I've had to call support for the software a couple of times, and they've walked me through a re-install of the included software.  They sound like they get a lot of the same calls.  For god's sake fellas, put a patch on the web.  So in summary, keep your fingers crossed on software, and get a spare battery.  I still think this is the best camera in the price class.","I shoot pictures for a living; no I'm not a professional photographer, however in my line of work we shoot between 5-20 digital photos a day.  A typical year is 2-3 thousand digital photos, plus personal ones, so I need a workhorse of a camera.  I have been using Kodak product, they have been reliable and do a good job. It came time to swap out my DC215 Zoom and I was drawn toward the size and ease of use of the PowerShot line of cameras.  The nice thing about this camera is the sophistication of the features, and ease of use.  For a quick photo, just turn the dial to automatic, point and shoot.  If you need to play with exposure settings, add an affect, shoot several frames in a row, or take a short video all that is possible as well.  Time will tell if the camera can handle the daily use and abuse like the Kodak, but so far I'm very impressed and am enjoying this camera very much.","with this camera or its abilities.  This is the first digital camera that I have purchased, but it won't be the last thanks to my initiation into this genre of photography. This camera can do everything that a novice to amateur level photog. can ask of it.<br />The automatic camera settings are very realistic, and the advanced (manual) settings are much more numerous than similar cameras in this price range/megapixels.  Manual settings don't take very long to learn, and give the user just enought freedom so as not to totally blow any important shots you may be taking.  The LCD is bright and clear, and the function buttons and menus are very easily navigated.  If you do however have to look in the owner's manual for some guidance, Canon leads the way as far as simplicity and explainations go. All the descriptions are accompanied by photos representing what buttons the user is to press to reach the desired result.<br />For me, the most impressive part of this package are the solid construction of the camera body (all metal and easily gripped with one hand,)and the advanced editing software that accompanies the imageviewing software for your computer.  I was excited by how real the photos looked, but was twice as pleased after I touched up the photos with the editing software.<br />I used a ...printer that isn't necessarily a \"photo\" printer to catalog my shots, and the pictures were better than any I had experienced with a 35mm camera.<br />If you are looking for a light-weight, yet pocketable digital camera that will take better pictures than you thought were possible, then look no further than the Canon S330 Digital Elph.","Great little camera!  After months of research and deciding on buying a Canon S300, I was pleased to discover that they had released an updated model, the S330.  Its resolution is 0.1 megapixle lower than the S300, but it includes many refined features.<br />I've used the camera for a little over a week now and have taken nearly 500 pictures and am still on my second battery charge (about 2/3 of the pictures I've taken have been with the LCD off).  The included 8 MB compact flash card limits the number of hi-res, hi-quality pics you can take, but you can buy a 128 MB card for a little over 50 bucks (I recommend one from SimpleTech) and be able to hold from 128 to over 1000 pictures, depending on resolution & quality.<br />The camera has lots of options and is especially versatile in its \"manual\" mode where you have a little more control than you do in the full auto mode.  It gives you freedom to lock the AE, focus and other settings, as well as apply special effects/enhancements.  I leave the camera in manual mode most of the time, since it retains its point-and-shoot simplicity; that way there's one less step to take (turning the selector dial) when I want to change how the camera's taking pictures.<br />It also has a video mode and photostitch mode.  In the photostitch mode the camera helps you line up multiple shots so you can merge them into a single panoramic shot using software on your PC (included).<br />If you're considering this camera but fear it may be too small to easily hold, don't worry.  I have larger than average hands and have no problems at all with manipulating the buttons and taking pictures (although, as with all things, it takes some practice).<br />Enough rambling, the bottom line is....<br />This is definitely the BEST 2 MP, 3 x zoom, compact digital camera available at this time.","I am an avid photographer and have been looking to upgrade to a new portable digital camera.  I received this camera and within one day I was already taking high quality pictures with this camera.<br />For an everyday user this camera would be a perfect choice.  Once you figure out how the menu system works all the functions of this camera are easy to learn how to use.<br />The one bad thing I have to say about this camera is that the video and sound quality are a little disappointing.  While it is a very cool feature to have on a small digital camera, this could have been improved.<br />Overall I am very happy with this camera and would suggest it to anyone looking for a small, pocket-sized digital camera.","\"No way to go wrong with this baby...\"<br />This is my second digital camera, and let me tell you, I am very impressed! My first camera was the s300 and I thought that I was never going to get another one as good, but the s330 excelled all my expectations. It is cheaper than the s300 and have more features and a better ISO, a problem that really frustrated me in the past with my S300. Overall both of them have the same specs but the additional speaker and the better menu made the s330 #1 in my list. Please remember that this is not a pro camera, but the photo quality is outstanding even at large formats like 8x11. The colors are better than the sony and olympus. I do recomend an extra battery if traveling and a way larger flash card. Newegg.com sell mr. flash 128mb for less than 60 bucks. I have bought 2 and have them for over 6 months and never had a problem with them. I did a lot of research before purchasing this camera and let me assure that this is the best digital camera for every day and even semi pro users. There is no need to follow the crazy trend of the more mega pixels the better. 2.1 is more than enough. I get the same or even better results than normal film. Because of the extra ISO options and the better price the s330 is a winner over the s300.","I had been looking for a digital camera for a while when I stumbled upon the Canon Powershot S330. At first glance [it] seemed a lot to spend on a 2 megapixel digital camera but being my first digital purchase I decided to try it out.<br />At first i just took pictures using the automatic function figuring that the manual controls would be too dificult but within the first day I was shooting pictures in manual mode, adjusting white balance and lighting and such, and printing them. I was very surprised by the quality that my two year old inkjet print the pictures at (as long as you don't look too close or print them over 8x10 which your not supposed to do anyways) on glossy photo paper.<br />I was also concerned because indoor shots came out very dark but I soon realized that the brightness could be adjusted with the included software which was very basic yet helpful. The movie quality is low but that's not what a camera is for so it's a nice little extra.<br />Overall I have had no problems with the camera and I am very pleased with my purchase. This would be an excellent camera for anyone looking for an easy camera for a novice with some advanced functions. If there was one thing I could change I wish it was a little smaller but besides that I am very happy and excited for that next oppurtunity where I can show off my new digital camera.","I have used an S110 for several months. I have taken, saved and edited over 1000 photos. Subjects ranged from family photos, wedding, air museum, catalog photos to light use at work. Bright colors and skin tones are outstanding with the advantage of adjusting ISO from 50 to 400 in manual mode. As much as I enjoy the S110, (I take it everwhere) I needed more features that the  S330 offers. I am willing to trade off extra  features for the S110's smaller size. The menus are easier to navigate and the red eye reduction seems to be more effective. The price for the S330...at Amazon is comparable to what I paid for the S110. The zoom feature during playback has a higher magnification and you have the ability to zoom in at all areas of the photos. The built-in speaker is an added bonus during video and memo playback. An extra battery (NB-1LH), higher capacity compact flash cards (32M, 64M and 128M) and soft case  go a long way towards making this excellent camera more useful and mobile. My next purchase will be the waterproof case (WP-DC500) for scuba diving and fishing photos."]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE F100","amazon_reviews":["I have several other new cameras with mush higher resolution but this is the best camera I have ever had.

(You can read about other complaints in the rest of the reviews.) The file memory feature is sub-par on this camera. Basically, if your batteries die, your file memory function will reset itself, and the numbering gets screwy. It seems minor, but it's a real pain if you like to have all of your pictures numbered nicely, and honestly, Minolta should have designed their camera with this simple thing in mind.","There are very mixed reviews on this product so I would like to clear up some issues.<br />Contrary to other reports, this camera is amazingly durable.  From the memory cards (Secure Digital) to the aluminum case; I dropped this on cement from about four feet, it dented the cast but didn't faze the camera.<br />You'll want rechargeble double A's for it and as long as you're good about formatting the memory card frequently when it's a big one (128 or 256mb) then it should work flawlessly and quickly.<br />The two drawbacks I see are only thirty seconds of video record time (which apparently is due to the fact that after about 20-25 seconds the audio and video get out of sync) most cameras now have at least 3 minutes and better quality.  The second drawback is the fact that you need to be a competent enough photographer to know that holding down the shutter button half-way autofocuses but also that you may need to adjust the amount of light allowed into the photo and the way the camera determines to use the flash, to avoid white-washing faces etc.<br />Other than that it's still an outstanding camera for the money ($180 used that is).  Although there are definitely better ones out there for just slightly more money.  Which reminds me, I bought mine refurbished and have seen no drawbacks from doing so.","outstanding quality photos, even action shots, awesome features, but drop it once on the hard floor and its toast. It's the retracting lens and cover that can get screwed up.","I got this as a gift over a year ago.  Works great and I'm very happy with it.  However, on a few occasions, the lens failed to open and I had to wait a while for it to start working again.  As with some digital cameras, the most annoying feature is the slight delay in taking pictures.  This is very frustrating when you're trying to capture a baby's actions!  The mini movie feature is great and so is the quality of the photos.  This is a good camera overall.","Have owned for a year....everything excellent except for the following:<br />Has trouble focusing in low light due to lack of low light assist lamp...<br />The battery door hatch needs to be handled with extreme care. Mine now needs to be taped shut because it likes to pop open unexpetedly.<br />not perfect, but lots of good features, and great pics","This could obviously just be the camera I received, but twice in the past nine months the camera has shut down with the lens fully extended and cannot be turned back on (I bought the AC adapter, tried every kind of battery under the sun, etc.).  It had to be returned to Minolta for service both times.  I won't be buying another Minolta.<br />Having said that, the camera does take very high quality pictures when used properly and has a lot of features.  It's a little slow between photos and eats batteries but these are common complaints with many digital cameras.<br />Check out the Nikon Coolpix line.  Both My brother and my sister-in-law just received the Coolpix 4800 as a gift and they both love it.","The Dimage F-series of digital cameras are nothing short of AMAZING.  Or AWESOME.  Or PERFECT.  Each model is a perfect balance between size (compact, take-anywhere) and features (especially the number of manual controls which simply don't exist on other digital cameras, even excellent offerings from Canon or Fuji).  3X optical zoom is pretty standard on prosumer cameras these days; of course it would be nice to have 10X or 30X or 100X optical zoom, but at what price?  The F100 (and other F models) are very well priced, being affordable to every level of digital camera enthusiasts.<br />Unlike the flat dimensions of the Dimage X-series, the F-series models are a bit elongated and hence *easier* to hold (especially if you are rightie, of course).  The controls are pretty straightforward, although you might want to keep the manual handy the first couple days you use the camera.  Rechargable batteries are dirt cheap these days with the Chinese entering the market, and NiMH ones have twice the recharge cyles as LiIon ones, so power is not a problem -- you just should bring enough for your trip.<br />I also love the fact Minolta uses SD memory cards.  My Fujitsu laptop (as well as other multimedia laptops from Toshiba and HP) have a built-in SD/MMC slot, so I can just stick in the SD card and it instantly sits on my XP desktop as a removable drive.  Then it's just easy drag-n-drop in Windows Explorer!  Just perfect!<br />What can I say.  If you don't have an F100 (4 megapixel) or F300 (5.3 megapixel) already, go get one today!","I've owned it for 4 months now and it's a very good camera, especially for the price...  Normal compression @ 4M resolution results in about 1 meg JPGs.  Compression artifacts are not visible unless you blow them up very large: >8x11.  4 resolution options w/3 or 4 compression options.  Video w/sound works great.  Compact enough for your shirt pocket.  Quality aluminum body.  Many features in a moderately easy to use menu; more features = more layers.  Downloads fast, about 1 sec/meg so no need for a card reader.  Win Me & 2000 auto installed it as a generic USB card reader, I never had to enter anything!<br />Cons; shutter lag is about 1 sec.  You can speed it up if you depress the shutter half way to prefocus.  On/Off dial is too easy to turn on in your pocket.  Eats batteries.  I could not get it to work with alkalines, only rechargables or the supplied disposable lithium.  Only comes w/16M SD card.  Slightly awkward to hold.  Weak flash.","After extensive research on this site and several others, I returned my Canon S200 and upgraded to the Minolta F100. I am very pleased with my purchase, because this is an excellent camera well-suited to my two main reasons for finally making the move to digital: clear, quick snapshots and the flexibility to completely control the shot. With a set of rechargeable lithium-ions (not included - easily worth the $ I paid) and a 128MB SD card I was able to shoot over 100 pictures at a friend's birthday party (most with flash, including movies, motor-drive style, automatic and manual exposures). I dropped them onto my ibook and went right back out to try my hobbyist's hand at our historic village. I can't think of a thing to complain about: this camera is small enough to go into a jacket pocket, versatile enough to offer complete f-stop, shutter speed and exposure control, and it takes phenomenally good pictures at all image grades (from the 2 MB, small to the 4MB superfine level). No purple fringing, no unnatural white balance - just excellent pictures. Worth every penny. Finally time to retire my APS Elph after 7 years. (I had also considered the S230 and the S45, but they just didn't match up. The S230 was overpriced and limited in its flexibility, while the S45 was too big and too expensive. I'm hooked on the Minolta.","No, Tin Liu, I don't have any problems like you are experiencing.  My camera is noiseless when I'm not snapping a picture and the LCD is as crisp as they come.<br />I remember when I was in Superfine mode, the load times to view my picture was incredibly long and the camera made noise to access my picture.  Are you in superfine mode by chance?<br />Tonia Clifford","I have to question for the people who have this camera. When I turn it on and set it to AUTO mode, the camera will make noises (sound like a broken radio, you have to put your ear near the LCD to hear it), and the picture showing in the LCD will be blurry a little for a second. If I leave on a table (not moving it), the noise will stop. If I move it, the noise will appear again. It doesnt have this problem in Manual mode or other modes. I returned this camera twice and still having this problem. Please let me know if your camera does the same thing or is it just me. Thanks.  Otherwise, its a very good 4M camera ...","I always loved taking pictures!  I got this as a gift from my husband and was so thrilled.  I am taking alot more pictures and having lots of fun.  The results are unbelievable.  I am taking my camera every where I go. I love the instant result.  This truely is the best camera I ever had.","This is a great camera what can I say i have taken pics from it and people think that they are professional, great image quality, fair battery life.. just get like 8 recharable batteries and you can go a full day , the flash really takes the battery life away.. any way if you are looking for the best priced 4mp camera i would go with this one","I've have bought both the Sony P7 and the Canon S230 in the past 3 weeks, and took them both back.  The Minolta F100 blows them away!  If you are considering either of these cameras, be sure to check out the Minolta first.  It way more feature-packed.<br />The Sony had awful software (totally unusable) and the pictures were all fuzzy on the edges of the subjects - like I shot them with a softening filter.  And having to charge the battery inside the camera with the bulky cords was a hassle.<br />The Canon, for a $400 camera, has no date stamp imprint!  You have to apply it with their software!  Sometimes I print right from my printer and don't even involve my PC.  Completely unacceptable.<br />In comparison, the Minolta offers these added features:<br />*It's 4 Megapixels instead of only 3!<br />*A separate LCD display of camera settings and options, as well as having the option to display them in your main LCD too.  Nice if you don't want your view to be cluttered with settings.<br />*I happened to find it alot cheaper online from a reputable major retailer than at the major electronics stores nearby.  It came with an extra 64mb card and leather case for less than either the Sony or Canon!  :-D<br />*It has a movie mode with sound, but you can also attach a voice message to any photo!<br />*I like the CR-V3 batteries.  My Kodak had them and they don't drain as fast as everyone complains they do.  They are not expensive...so just keep an extra handy.<br />*I have Windows XP, and had to download a software version updatefrom minolta.com to be able to transfer my photos, but it went smoothly.<br />*There are all manual settings too, for those that might want to have that control.  My pictures on auto are fantastic.<br />*The only thing I don't like is that you have to have the camera in manual mode to have the date imprint.  I don't really understand why, but it's a tiny tiny detail.  I just put it in that mode but don't change any of the settings it already has - it works just fine.<br />You really need to give this camera a look!  You won't be disappointed!","This camera takes great pictures. The movie mode needs improvement. The movies it takes are fair.","This is my second digital camera and I am thrilled with it!  What I love about this camera is its manual settings which allow you to control f-stops and aperature.  But it's also fully automatic, so I can snap a quick shot, or set up exactly what I want for a protrait of the night sky.  The scene settings in the automatic mode are also very nice.  I like the sunset one especially.<br />The video feature is uniqe because sound is included with video--great memory maker.  I have not used the audio recording feature much, but on a 128MB card, I can record up to 30 minutes of audio at a time!<br />Minolta makes a great product; the optics are the highest quality.  This camera is perfect for those who want to dive into the digital camera market at the top of the class and also for those who want a no-nonsense user-friendly product that takes maginficent photos.  Five stars is not enough for this product!","After being a die-hard film photographer for the last 20 years, I finally took the plunge and bought a digital camera.  After much research, I decided on the Minolta F100.  This camera is the perfect size for backpacking and other trips.  You will never have to worry about leaving it behind.  I was a little disapointed that the camera did not come with an A/C adapter, but I bought an inexpensive SD/MMC memory card reader that connects to my computer via a USB cable.  This way the camera does not have to be on in order to download pictures to your computer, thus saving wear and tear on the camera, and saving batteries.  Speaking of batteries, I like the fact that the Minolta gives you the option of using AA batteries, which can be a real benefit if you run out of Lithium and/or rechargeable batteries.<br />Most importantly, the pictures are great!  The camera is easy to use in automatic mode, but you have the option of complete control in manual, aperture priority, and shutter priority modes.","The good:<br />Ultra compact, feature rich(I love the subject tracking AF), good picture, easy menu.<br />The bad:<br />weak flash, barrel distortion at the wide angle side.<br />This camera takes good pictures under bright light. But the flash is very weak(effictive within about 6 feet), and it often produce over exposed spots on reflective surface, so if it's not absolutely necessary, turn it off, the fast lens can handle most low light situation(you can turn to manul mode and adjust the aperture to the largest).<br />The barrel distortion at the wide angle is very obvious. I got bended floor lamp, it's much worse than my film SLR(Olympus IS-30). The default turn-on focus setting is the widest angle, so remember move it a little bit to the tele, kind of anoying.<br />Overall satisfied with this camera, subject tracking AF is cute. Takes very detailed pictures, white balance works very good. And it's easy to manipulate pictures with bundled software.","Great feel, easy to hold and manipulate (as long as you are right-handed).  Rechargable batteries are a necessity, and seem to last as long as the $10 disposable. I don't like the shutter lag, or the time required for auto focus, as I cannot get true \"snap\" shots.  I also do not like the way the memory does not hold my last date or other settings between uses.  As for downloading, it is a snap to plug into computer USB port--takes less than 10 seconds to empty camera memory onto PC.  I enjoy most using the camera to take photos of California from the air--even through the glass of a pressurized cockpit, the focus is sharp.","Overall, a small, easy to carry feature packed camera. Subject Tracking AF and Area AF make it easy to stay locked onto a subject that's moving so you can take a clear picture. The 110,000 pixel LCD display provides a crisp clear image. The optional RC-3 remote control allows you to tripod mount the camera and take self-portraits--if you think being able to do that is worth the [money]for the remote.<br />A customer from San Diego, CA USA claimed that the F100 'did not have \"time stamp\" option which will allow customer to put date on picture automatically'. Actually it does. Under Manual mode, Menu->Custom 2 tab, there's an option called \"date imprint\". Turning it on sticks the date on the photo automatically. This option applies to manual mode, but you can still configure manual mode with the menus to be mostly automatic anyway. Why so many complain about features a device doesn't (appear to) have without bothering to read the manual first, eludes me. Besides, why ruin a good picture with a big DATE STAMP when the camera records all of the image details in the jpeg file? With the software included, it's very easy to see the time, date, capturing device settings and dozens of other jpeg properties after the fact without compromising the photo.<br />The fact that Minolta doesn't include an AC adapter is a kicker because the AC-6 adapter costs a hefty [amount]. If you happen to have a card reader which is a better option than the USB cable anyway (go ahead and buy the 6-in-1 type so you can read anything), the adapter really isn't that important unless you like putting up slide shows on TV with the included A/V adapter cable.<br />Minolta was one of the few companies who considered customer convenience in this design--they wisely chose to use AA batteries. Olympus is one of the few manufacturers to use AAs in most of their models. Most cameras I reviewed in the 4MP range use those ridiculously overpriced proprietary Li-Ion batteries. If you happen to be overseas without a charger that supports alternate voltages (a situation I'm in frequently), you'd better take a spare, and plan on paying around [money], or foot the bill for a dual-voltage charger if you can even get one. On top of that, you'll be lucky if you get 2 years out of the stupid things, and then you're out another [money] or so if the manufacturer even still makes them by that time. Minolta eliminated all of this pain by using standard off-the-shelf good old [inexpensive] AAs in the F100. Buy a few NiMH to carry around and keep a couple of lithium AAs with you to use if you run out of charged NiMH batteries. Worst case, stop at a gas station and load up on Alkaline AAs. They'll have a shorter life, but at least your camera still functions! If you're looking at cameras that use proprietary batteries, think long and hard about how you might wind up without the facilities to recharge before you buy. Sooner or later, it will be a problem.<br />The LCD is recessed which helps protect it from sharp objects sliding over the back of the camera--an unfortunate oversight on another brand which now has several scratches across the screen.<br />The lens retracts into the camera and a cover automatically closes to protect it. No lens cap to lose, no slide cover to forget to close. This lens cover design may not protect quite as well as a heavy sliding cover on other models, but given the price, I have no intentions of using my camera as a football anyway. Keep it in a padded carry bag.<br />One last pleasant surprise from the Minolta is the F100's ISO capability. Most cameras I've seen go up to 400, amd nearly all use 100-200 when left in auto--including the Minolta. In manual mode, the Minolta can go as high as ISO 800. This allows the camera to take photos in surprisingly low-light situations--often without the flash! There is a tradeoff though: just as with film, the higher ISO settings result in \"granier\" images. Still, if it's grainy or nothing, I'll choose grainy.","I bought this camera after my wonderful husband dropped and broke my Fuji Finepix 2400. I decided to upgrade to a 4 mp camera and after MUCH research, I chose the Minolta F100. I've had it for about a month now and absolutely love it! The pictures are brilliant and the prints from my printer are almost film photo quality. It is small enought to fit in your purse or pocket, and it has a feature that once you lock in on your subject, it'll follow it around and take a great picture - great for taking pictures of an active toddler! The trick is to press and hold the shutter button half way down to focus, and when you're ready, snap your picture! I haven't missed many shots this way!<br />The bottom line is that this is one of the best values for the money - it has better features than most of the 4 mp cameras in this class, as Minolta came late in the game of digital imaging and has to 'catch' up with the rest of the world, thus giving you great features, quality, and ease of use, for much, much less.","It is a pretty good camera. But I am just wondering, it did not have \"time stamp\" option which will allow customer to put date on picture automatically. It will be very important when you try to have family photos.","Two choices when i wanted to buy a digcam:Dimage F100 or Sony Cybershot DSC-P9. both 4MP, similar design, weight and size. Minolta is ($$$) cheaper but no AC adaptor, charger and rechargeable batteries. these cost about ($$$). So no big difference. so far, the pic quality is perfect and it is very easy to use.","While the F100 is optically terrific and physically sized for convenience, the LCD monitor is vitually invisible in bright outdoor light. Also, the camera's housing is very fragile. Packing the F100 without a hard carrying case in a full backpack will likely dent the camera's housing and void the warranty.","I don't know much about digital camers (at least not until i started looking to buy one.)  i wanted one that was real easy to carry around, had a high pixel count and was reasonably priced.  i almost got a canon s30 or s40, but decided they were too big for me.  i also almost got a sony dsc 9, but felt that minolta had a better name in photography.  so far, i really dig the camera.  it offers me lots of photographic options - black and white is cool, plus you can easily delete pix you don't like.  i wanted a good camera for an upcoming trip to costa rica and i think i have it now!","Very good package at a good price compared to other bulky competitors. Functions are better designed than the Canon S40. feels comfortable and heavy enough to take stable shots. The autofocus makes it easier for other family members to take pictures and enjoy the camera too.<br />It would be better if it came with a minolta charger, but I guess most do not ==> Don't forget to order good batteries and a battery charger.<br />Download to the computer is much faster than I thought it would be. On the negative side , voice recording with video mode seems a littel weak.","I just love this camera for the great combination of features it provides in ths small sleek take-everywhere package. But features alone wouldn't suffice without good picture quality, and the F100 delivers excellent pictures for an ultracompact. Nice sharpness throughout the entire lens, and natural well-balanced colors. Autofocus is fairly fast and reliable. Works on two AA batteries and gives only average battery life, but the convenience and cost-savings of being able to use rechargeable NIMH batteries is well worth the tradeoff. In fact, this was a big selling point for me. I have a [brand name] digital camera that uses a proprietary li-ion battery which is very expensive, though it does last long. But for an ultracompact like the F100, I much prefer the AA batteries. One other plus for the F100 is the 4 megapixels. Some other compacts,... , only give you 2 megapixels. For the most casual photographer, this may be enough. But when you end up cropping some shots, like I do, the extra megapixels are mandatory. There is a full range of manual controls for the more advanced shooters, plus a wide range of auto settings for complete point-and-shoot convenience. I'm glad I waited for this model to come out before going for one of the many other digital compacts out there.","It is small, light, fits in my pocket or my wife's purse. I have owned mine 5 months and it has been trouble free. The autofocus works perfectly if you remember that the subject can move , not the camera AND the subject. Great flesh colors free of magenta or purple and as a matter of fact it is the first digital that I have owned that gives me great colors without going through Photoshop.At that price it deserves 5 stars.Caveat:The control button turns so easily that the camera turns itself on in your pocket or even in its case.","Don't be annoyed at Minolta. If you don't feel that you need it for extending the photo/film time of the camera. And only for connecting for editing and formatting, go with a USB card reader.<br />They are a great way to go: much cheaper, and you usually get software along with the reader. I have one for the sd discs that are used with this camera and it works great. Cool lookin' too.<br />Oh...and the USB cable is included...so no reason to be annoyed.","Once I got a hold of this camera, I was in love.  Its easy to use, great design, and the quality of the pictures is superb.  I waited a little while before jumping into the digital camera race, and this one was worth the wait!  I would recommend it to both a beginner and a more experienced photographer.","The good: Great pictures, compact ergonomic design - classy.  So far I am pleased with the camera.<br />The bad: I am annoyed that Minolta choose not to package an AC adapter with this camera.  Further - how about mentioning this little detail in the advertising so those purchasers like myself could order it.  Here I am back at the Amazon site and guess what - no sign of the AC adapter - probably another $50 when I find one.  Minolta even recommends this option (per their manual) when connecting to a computer!","After spending more than a year looking for just the right digital camaera, I chose the F100 and am very happy. With 4 megapixels, 3x zoom, and good optics, the camera is an excellent value for the price.<br />Most of all, I love the design and ergonomics (I'm an industrial designer and ergonomic engineer, so I'm fussy about these things). The camera is very sturdy and has a clean all-metal housing. It's very small as well, yet it's still quite easy to hold and operate with one hand. The controls make good sense too. Aesthetically, it's very smart looking without being over the top.<br />The area autofocus works well, though the subject tracking responds so slowly that It doesn't seem that helpful. No matter. All in all, it takes great pictures in Auto mode, and also has a \"Multi\" mode which gives you full manual control over focus and exposure, or you can choose to control some things and let the camera handle the rest.<br />Note that unlike some cameras, it doesn't include a rechargeable battery or charger, but it does take 2 AAs.  You can buy a smart charger and 4 AA NiMH batteries--around the same cost as buying a second proprietary battery for rival cameras.<br />All in all, this is well designed and constructed fully featured camera in a small, elegant package."]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE 7i","amazon_reviews":["I fell in love with my last  Minolta camera and wanted to try a newer verision of the Minolta.

Let me enlighten you. This camera has the same autofocus that all slrs and P&S'rs have. it's a horizontal strip of pixels that checks contrast. Make sure you line up your camera along vertical details or turn it sideways for horizontal details when autofocusing. It's SIMPLE. Many people also complain about manual focus. This is how it works.

The lens is fantastic- wide angle all the way to long zoom.  The manual zoom makes this camera feel like a proper SLR.  The camera gives great feedback on the LCD about what an exposure will look like.  The autofocus is good, but hunts a bit sometimes... so locking on to something and keeping the shutter half down is the way to go.  The battery usage is pretty heavy, and you need a spare set (or two) of good new NiMH batteries if you're planning on shooting more than 150 shots in a day.

It is a shame that Minolta went out of the camera business, because this is a fantastic image catcher.","I got this camera *years* ago!  I still work with it occasionally, but back in it's hayday, I used it for bulb photography with lightning.  The plus was using infinity and not autofocus (because the autofocus is horrendous), but the negatives were a maximum 60 second bulb and lots of noise.  Of course, back when this camera was $1,000+, it was pretty good.  Still, in the daylight it takes beautifully vivid photos.  I upgraded the firmware on it just before Konica halted the production of all cameras, which was supposed to fix the autofocus, but didn't make any difference to me.  It's been through rain, snow and heat and has still held up.  She's probably been through at least 10,000 pictures (lots of lightning photos that contained no lightning, probably every 95 in 100 were deleted).  Very robust.

The compact flash memory cards are fairly inexpensive and small so you can have a few backups for those multi picture extravaganzas.<br />The one thing I would love to see addressed on the camera is the batteries... it would be nice to see minolta come with a battery, rechargable, rather than tring to keep up with two or three sets of AA s ...  The instruction book... (guess I will have to read or at least review sooner or later ) looks like it covers pretty much anything you can run accross.<br />Would I recommend this  camera?  Yes I would but not for the inexperienced guy... when you first look at this camera... there seems to be a lot to digest... but all in all... Love it!","I have heard bad reviews that this particular camera eats batteries, but I have not had any problems with batteries being used up fast.  My last camera, which was only 2.2 Megapixels ate batteries much faster than the Dimage 7i.  The picture quality is excellent.  When the camera is taking pictures in it's best quality, you can see those minute blemishes that you don't usually notice in pictures.  This camera is by far the best that I have ever tried.  Highly reccommended to buy if you are in the market for a 5.0+ megapixel camera.","The good:<br />Great zoom range. It's the only ZLR that goes as wide as 28mm (35mm equivalent).<br />The bad:<br />Very poor focusing, especially in low light.<br />The ugly:<br />More noise than you'd expect. A better alogarithm is need. A digital camera is only as good as its programming.<br />The electronic viewfinder is virtually useless. The low pixel count and distorted viewfinder optics do it in.","I was very hesitant to buy a digital camera being an avid SLR fan.But I'm pleased to say the 7i has exceeded my expectations & I can say goodbye to conventional film. I've discovered it is a power hog but I've overcome this obstacle by purchasing 2 sets of Monster batteries(note the battteries that come with the camera are useless).I can shoot around 300 pictures w/flash no problem plus I have the ac adapter for home use when I'm snapping pictures of the kids.I can blow up my pictures to any size and the clarity is  awesome! You lose no resolution.In fine I find I can take good action shots, when you get into superfine or RAW it takes the camera a few seconds to catch up to you. This camera is not for amateur's. It's too complex, but if you are an advanced photographer you will find this camera to be a thrill! You will need to purchase a flashcard a minimum of 256mb.I ordered a 256mb card because the 16 mb card that comes with this camera is a joke! You can take 1 picture in RAW or Superfine and maybe 8 in fine. I'm looking to get at least a GIG for vacations probably 2.Another important consideration is that this is compatible with Minolta Vectis SLR lenses & flash units a huge mark to its favor.","As a freelance photographer I have really put this camera through the ropes.  It offers outstanding features and lets you see \"real time\" the effect you're having on the exposure as you change the settings.  It has a really convenient quick-view mode, which allows you to quickly flick through pictures without putting the camera on \"view\" mode.<br />  These are the camera's strong points:<br />- Great built in filters<br />- A wealth of top-shelf features<br />- Amazing zoom range, and<br />- Very intuitive traditional controls<br />But alas nothing in life is perfect.  Most reviewers here have faulted battery life - trivial compared to these issues:<br />TIFF and RAW - Completely useless.  Don't ever bother with them if you want to shoot multiple shots.  TIFF and RAW files take an outrageous amount of time to save to the compact flash card rendering them useless.  Don't use, unless you have an unchanging subject and all day to shoot it.<br />Auto ISO - It will always pick a ISO setting that is too high and generate an unacceptable amount of noise in your images, especially in low light.  If you notice noisy pictures, just set the ISO manually and counter balance it with your exposure biasing.<br />To sum up, a great camera with only two flaws.  That's the least I've ever experienced with any camera.  Go for it!","I have owned several Minolta products in the past and never had a problem.  Therefore when it came time to go to digital for work (Crime Scene Investigations) I had no reservations with the Minolta.  I have been using this camera for some time now and cannot say enough about the camera itself.  The macro is wonderful and the white light adjustment has saved me several times.  At the same time it is so simple in the program mode, that you can pass it off to almost anyone.  I have used this camera to photograph things that most people don't want to talk about and it has never failed me.  The software is more complex than necessary and the battery life is short, but the camera itself is excellent!","Minolta's Dimage 7i is expensive, but its design is inviting. One of its most outstanding qualities is its generous zoom-range. At 28-200mm, it is a novelty in this digicam category: a masterpiece with excellent wide-angle and focussing system. The listed 5.24 megapixels buck, which effectively yields a 4.95 megapixels resolution proved capable. Its quality images testified to this fact. Minolta's styling choice ensured that Dimage 7i has well-positioned accessories and control buttons. But the main setback is that the high-speed 7fps burst falters each time I set the camera at its maximum resolution.<br />Overall, this is a fine photo tool whose image quality is superior to that of its immediate predecessor, the Dimage 7.","I have never challenged my photography skills until I got this camera. The first month or so that I had it, (got in August 2002) I used it in the fully automatic mode. Learning all of the features and settings is a challenge -- that's not a complaint - this camera is so packed with functionality that you will have to learn it over time. I never heard of White Balance until I got this camera. I am now using the manual modes and taking photographs I never thought were possible. Don't get me wrong, the manual modes are great but when you want to push the limits of your creativity - this camera will allow you to do it.","Not here to rate the camera, but to inform those who wish to buy it that there is a better deal out there. I just want to help the world :)<br />Go ...and search for the camera<br />It is almost cheaper. Well have fun, and I love to save the world money.<br />Shopper D","Finally, a digital camera similar to that of an SLR.  I've purchased serveral digital cameras in the past only to return them because I was not completely satified with their results. The Minolta Dimage 7i is awesome in many ways!  First, the size of the lense (APO) is great for taking wide angle shots.  Most digital cameras have only a small lense.  This camera is great for anyone wanting a SLR type camera.  I was overwhelmed with the amount of features, but once I read the manual several times, I was able to use all of it's features.  The camera design speaks for it's self.  Great Pictures!  I've compared the Nikon 5700 and Olympus E20 and no comparison.  Secondly, the mere fact that the camare accepts rechargeable AAA rather than your typical Lithium-ion Battery is a plus. I've learned that after owning a Lithium-ion battery for several years, it tends to fayed out; thus, cause a new purchase.  The Minolta Dimage is a great camera and one that I will certainly keep.","Unlike other 5 megapixel SLRs, this one is reasonably priced, but still has every feature you could imagine. I discovered that standard resolution images, at about 1 MB each, are all you need to make 35mm quality 5x7 prints. I couldn't see any improvement at the fine resolution that requires twice as much memory, and superfine requires so much as to be impractical. The camera only comes with a 16 megabyte memory card, so you will want at least a 256 megabyte CompactFlash card which will store 150+ standard images. Advanced 35mm photographers will be pleased that this camera has all the features you expect on a quality SLR, such as shutter or aperture priority or manual exposure modes, spot metering, exposure and focus lock, auto/manual focus, etc. But on top of that you get the equivalent of a 28mm-200mm f2.8 macro zoom in an incredibly compact package, electronic versions of every color correction filter, a 2x digital zoom (on top of the 7x optical zoom; on my old 2 MP camera, digital zoom was worthless - on this camera I still got acceptable images with digital zoom) and the ability to change \"film\" speed (which affects the image noise level) from ISO 100 to ISO 800 whenever you want to get more sensitivity. There is also an adequate built in flash, or you can add an external flash. The lens is also threaded for external filters like a UV lens protector. Connection to my Windows XP PC was effortless.<br />Drawbacks: even with the best 1850 mAh NiMH batteries, this camera is very fast to warn you that your batteries are low, so be sure to get several sets of batteries and fast chargers (one set of batteries and a charger is included). And there are so many buttons and features, it takes a while to remember which feature or menu or option goes with which button; I think there's some logic to it, but I haven't figured it out yet. It does have a simple \"put me back in dumb point-and-shoot mode\" button, but a technophobe might not appreciate all the capabilities of this camera. Finally, the optional AC adapter is outrageously expensive, but generic ones are available for less than half the price.<br />Update: 1. If you have your heart set on using the \"super-fine\" mode, besides the fact that it uses a large amount of memory, be aware that the camera \"goes dead\" for about a minute while the image is written to the flash card. 2. At first I thought an optical SLR viewfinder would be better than electronic, but I really love this camera's EVF. It lets you see exactly how your shot will be exposed, which is really nice for critical high-contrast shots like landscapes. 3. Next, the camera seems to overexpose slightly outdoors, but this is readily apparent in the EVF and easily compensated for using the digital effects control. 4. Finally, if you want a Remote Cord, they are very expensive, as all the Minolta accessories seem to be.<br />Update 2: If you want more power than the built in flash, I've discovered that although this camera uses the same Minolta flashes as the Maxxums, generic dedicated flashes made for Maxxums WILL NOT work with this camera, so you have to buy a Minolta flash. The 3600HS(D) is the cheapest and a very nice flash, but still relatively very expensive if you just want a little more power than the built in flash.","On 12/03/02 I have uprated my review to four stars from two stars. I recently had to send the 7i back to Minolta for repair of the flash unit. When they returned it, I found that the autofocus works quite well. They said on the invoice that they did a complete cleaning and adjusted to factory specs. Apparently that corrected the autofocus problem with my camera. So I amend the quoted text below with this new information. There are still a fair number of people on the forums that report autofocus problems, so this may be a quality control problem. I must say that Minolta's waranty service was easy to obtain and speedy.<br />\"The 7i is a camera that should have great potential but misses. It is my fourth digital still camera, and the most problematic. Auto focus often does not work. This is the biggest problem and one that is well documented on the digital camera forums. The D7 had this problem also and Minolta claims they fixed it, but apparently not. I point, I get auto focus confirmation in the view finder, I shoot, and too many times the 7i decides to focus on something other than the subject\". Auto exposure is also iffy. There is a tendancy for these cameras to over expose. This is not a point and shoot camera. It is possible to get some excellent pictures, but this camera takes a lot of getting used to and requires a lot of tweaking.<br />Another problem is higher than average image noise for a camera of this resolution. This is another problem that is well documented on the forums. Too bad I did not take the time to search before purchasing.<br />The 7i has many useful modes and adustments. The problem is you have to twist a dial then press a button, and perhaps use even another dial or button to acomplish an adjustment. Really akward to use for candid photography. The manual focus ring is so close to the body that it is hard to get your fingers on to use.<br />All in all my Olympus digital cameras blow the 7i away on picture quality, auto focus, auto exposure and ease of use. I really wish I had stuck with my other cameras and waited for the next generation of 5 or 6 megapixel zoom cameras.<br />Before you buy this camera, do some on line searching for digital camera forums and check into the problems that experienced users are having with the Minolta 7xx series of cameras. You will wonder how, if they really put it through its paces, so many of the reviewers here gave it such a high rating.","I have a great deal of experience in photography, I have a degree in Audio/Visual Production, I used to teach Photography and I am an Associate of the Royal Photographic Society. I am at present working on an exhibition about poverty in Albania. The Dimage 7i is my first digital camera after a very long and very costly line of Canon EOS cameras and lenses.<br />Minolta Corporation is a traditional camera manufacturer of long experience, and excellent lens quality who made a slow but calculated entry into the digital marketplace as did I. Like its popular line of 35mm slrs, Minolta's Dimage Digital Cameras are developing a reputation for innovative technology in light metering, exposure control, and autofocus systems. Their lenses in particular are worth high praise for their optical quality.<br />Minolta shook up the high end of the semi-pro market, by beating everyone else to the punch with the first five megapixel semi-pro digital camera. - And it wasn't just \"any\" five megapixel model either, but the Dimage 7, an electronic SLR design with a remarkably high quality 7x optical zoom lens, a host of advanced image-control functions, and an all-new electronic viewfinder using ferroelectric LCD technology for impressive low light performance.<br />Now, just over a year later, Minolta has upped the ante again, with the Dimage 7i, a substantial upgrade to the original Dimage 7. The list of added features and improvements is long and impressive, but the most salient are a dramatic improvement in autofocus speed and shutter delay, the addition of high-speed sequence and movie modes, and a significant change in the camera's native color space. Many of the 7i's improvements are impressive enough in themselves, but viewed collectively the effect is that of an almost entirely new camera. Perhaps more to the point the upgrades aren't just changes for the sake of change itself, but the obvious result of listening carefully to the Dimage 7's existing community of users. Overall, an impressive upgrade to what was already an excellent camera. Read on for all the details!<br />Highlights<br />True 4.95-megapixel CCD delivering resolutions as high as 2,560 x 1,920 pixels.  12-Bit A/D conversion.<br />Digital Hyper Electronic viewfinder with 90-degree variable position.<br />1.8-inch TFT color LCD monitor.<br />7.2-50.8mm lens (equivalent to a 28-200mm lens on a 35mm camera) with a maximum aperture of f/2.8 to f/3.5, depending on the zoom setting.<br />2x digital zoom.<br />Auto and Manual focus.<br />Macro option at maximum telephoto or wide angle zoom settings.<br />Program AE, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Manual, and Subject Program shooting modes.<br />Shutter speeds from 1/2,000 to four seconds, with Bulb setting for longer exposures (up to 30 seconds), up to 1/4,000 under certain conditions.<br />300 segment Multi-Segment, Center-Weighted, and Spot metering options, with AE Lock function.<br />Adjustable ISO with five settings.<br />Built-in, pop-up flash with three operating modes, a dual-mode flash metering system, and manually adjustable intensity.<br />External flash hot-shoe for Minolta accessory flash units.<br />Built-in support for wireless TTL flash exposure with certain Minolta flashes.

(There could be other differences as well, but these are the ones I'm aware of.) The sheer length of this list will give you some idea of the extent of the improvements Minolta has made in the Dimage 7's design:<br />I purchased this camera for a photo-shoot in Albania, it truly gives my older Canon EOS 35mm system a run for its money. I was so impressed with this Minolta that I bought my wife the Minolta Dimage F100, also a great camera for stooting on the move.<br />I usually shoot in Fine mode with an Image Size of 1600 x 1200, using the amazing IBM 1gb Microdrive this gives me about 825 images on a drive!<br />My only regret is that Canon have nothing of this quality at this price point.","I have been an avid photo person for years.  And have had tons cameras.  So when I started with the Minolta Dimage 7i I was expecting somthing on par a good point and shoot 35mm.  I was using a Kodak DC215 zoom for my digital at the time.  But wanted something a little closer to my Canon Rebal.  Well Minolta Dimage 7i is on par with my beloved Canon Rebal.  I can say for the people that deal in digital photos this is the camera for you.  No film and great photos.  I now use this as my camera of choice for my Website... Money well spent.","I love this camera - I have had it for about 5 days.  It is easy to use.  Easy to figure out all the different functions.  The pictures are beautiful.  You can use it on automatic and get professional results.  Explore and get unbelievable night images.  The lens allows you to add filters.  Only the Sony allows this at this level of a camera.  Go for it you will love it.","I have owned a number of 35MM cameras, however I am still an ameture at both photography and computers. I researched quite extensively before deciding on the Dimage 7i. I am glad I took the time. After about six weeks I find it amazing what this camera offers for the expert, yet it is so simple to use for some one like myself who is in a hurry to start taking great pictures. One of the best features I have discovered is the spot metoring button. This combined with the the instant reveiw means I never have to guess at lighting or take a picture to discover later that my subject turned out to be too dark to recognise. I know I will be learning with this camera for some time but still taking great pictures from the start. I LOVE this camera.","I bought this camera right before a vacation that featured the Reno Air Races, Lake Tahoe, San Francisco, and Yosemite. To go with it I picked up a second set of rechargeable AA's and a 1gb Microdrive.<br />I am beyond pleased with the results.<br />At the Races...<br />I was able to stop props on planes flying near 500 mph and got several very nicely framed shots. The biggest drawback was that I was able to take only one picture per 20-25 seconds on the highest resolution (the write to the card after each picture forces this), so I had to lower the resolution to get a burst of pictures or risk missing a shot either in framing or in the delay. When I hit right I loved the action photos, but this was my biggest disappointment. I had to leave the autofocus off on several of the shots of the fastest planes or the delay would cause lose the picture, but the manual focus was fine for this.<br />In Tahoe and Yosemite...<br />Excellent shots with rich vibrant color. Playing with the options on the camera helped find bring out the colors in the sunsets and forest scenes. I did not bring any filters and I really needed a graded filter for some of the low-light situations as I was forced to choose exposures for the Ground or the sky, but that was my fault. Occasionally I had a different goal than the automatic settings, but this camera is a dream manually.<br />In San Francisco...<br />Incredible night scenes. The camera performed beautifully. I was able to get great pictures of Muir Woods and the Golden Gate.<br />Overall...<br />I wish - just a little - that the 7hi had been out before I went. Per the Minolta website it's able to take three picture bursts at the highest resolution before writing to disk and I think the black will wear better.<br />The battery life didn't hurt me as long as I had the second set, but I did have to change and charge every day and once had to switch to an emergency set of Alkalines (which it ate and spat out so quickly I thought it must have been an error)<br />But I took a few of the best pictures of my life and I ended with 7 gig of pictures to stroll through at my leisure and the 8 X 10's I have printed have been amazing.<br />I am very happy with my purchase and give it five stars because it does everything it says it does very well. But with the 7hi the bar goes a little higher yet.","Bought it for a Disney World vacation, received it 2 days before vacation started, read the manual on the road trip, took beautiful unforgettable pictures the following day. Perfect!! No more photo disappointments!! Snap a shot if it's not how you want it, simply delete it and try again.<br />  We are currently living in Germany where every day is a photo oppurtunity, this camera gives us the oppurtunity to take the photo and come home and share exactly what we saw with our loved ones back home immediately through easy internet and printing options. Designed to make amateurs feel like pros.","This is the third digital camera I have owned .... .Specifically, I was very concerned that indoor shots would come out blurry or dim. Let me say that this camera has produced the best indoor shots I have ever seen from a digital camera. Outdoor shots are great too but my biggest concern was put to rest.<br />This is a very intelligently designed camera...the weight feels good in my hands (not too light and not to heavy). The buttons and dials are placed well throughout the camera. Even though it has a big zoom, the camera doesn't look \"abnormal\" like the Sony Cybershot DSC-F707 which has a lens that sticks out like an eyesore. I don't understand why the Sony lens which is only 5x optical sticks out like that while this DiMage has a 7x zoom and is more compact.<br />The things I like best about this camera: 1) The focus is fast and accurate, the many extra focusing options are a nice plus (and not to mention the ability to use manual focus to adjust the autofocus), 2) indoor pictures come out sweet (and of course outdoors as well), 3) looks and feels like a film camera, 4) manual zoom gives you great control and saves batteries, 5) the flash is surprisingly strong, 6) the LCD is very bright and clear, and finally...a big big plus 7) the lens head is threaded for filter attachments! This seems like such a simple thing but so many digicams don't have this option! You will feel 100% better when you can go stick a cheap UV filter on the camera which will keep the DiMage camera lens from getting dust and scratches.<br />Things that could use some improvement on this camera:<br />1) The electronic view finder is slightly blurry around the edges. This was a little disappointing but I still use the EVF regularly to save batteries...the picture still comes out great. Manual focus changes may be difficult to notice through the EVF...you may want to switch to the LCD for manual focus adjustments. 2) The door to the AC Adapter and TV is a flimsy plastic door. 3) So far as I know, there are no add-on lenses specifically made for this camera (I am sure you could get something to work but why go through so much trouble?) I would love it if they made a wide angle lens attachment. 4) AC Adapter doesn't come with camera and is quite expensive ... but then again, many digicams don't include an AC Adapter. They tossed in some seriously good rechareable batteries and charger from Sanyo though which are 1850 mAh...hard to find that high capacity in the store!","This camera does it all. The lens is superb, which is absolutely necessary if you want your photographs to have a quality look. Needless to say a 7X optical zoom is an important tool.<br />The camera is highly automatic but almost, if not all, automatic features can be set manually.<br />Get about 12 NiMH AA batteries and a quick charger. 128MB compact flash cards are available for about [$$]. I have three cards with me always. At a fine resolutuin each card can accomodate about 50 very large jpgs. The best storage medium for large files in a CD-RW.","I've spent some time looking for a digital camera. I was looking for the best value in about ~[$$$]range and this camera is probably one of the best choices. What is so special in this camera?<br />- 28-200 zoom. It's very unusual to find a digital camera with zoom starting as low as 28 mm. And it makes a huge difference when you take pictures inside buildings. 28mm means significantly wider view then 35 or fourty something.<br />- Manual zoom. Many close competititors have motorized zoom. It's slow. Manual zoom gives you better control.<br />- Autofocus. It's just great. It's fast and if there is not enough light it switches to B&W mode so if you can see anything yourself in most cases your camera will be able to get autofocus to work.<br />- Manual focus. There is a ring and you can focus manually or tune after AF.<br />- EVF. Some people like optical viewfinders but keep in mind that on EVF you see what will be on your picture real time. Like if you shoot man on the snow you can see if his face too dark or too light before you press the button, not after.<br />- Lots of features. Minolta has probably the richest set of features in the class.<br />I really enjoy this camera. Highly, Highly recommended.","I purchased the Dimage 7i plus an IBM 1 Gig Microdrive. I am not sure which is more impressive, the Dimage or the Microdrive! The images one gets with this camera are 90% of the time 100% impressive.. indistiguishable from a flatbed scanned 8X10 glossy photograph. The auto focus feature is generally acceptable, however, the viewfinder or the LCD screen makes it nearly impossible to tell whether or not the subject is truely in focus; both are just to pixely to be sure.  If the subject matter is important, I always snap a few extras just in case. At 100% resolution using the fine setting, the microdrive is able to hold upwards of 350 images at a time. (nearly 10 rolls of 36 exp film!) I very much recommend getting the microdrive for this camera as it increases it's overall value 100%.  Too, the camera w/microdrive can be used as a storage device for anything on your PC. Connection to the computer via USP is very easy, although not fast if you are transferring large amounts of hi res images from a microdrive. I recommend getting a cup of coffee during such transfers. :O)<br />I also recommend buying at least three extra sets of NI-MH batteries and keep them charged at all times. (very inexpensive 4 packs available at Ritz Camera)<br />The memory and setup features on the camera can be confusing and yield unexpected results at times. (i am still not sure I have setup completely figured out)<br />The thing that really burned me about this product is that it does not come with an AC Adapter even though the box states that one is enclosed!... The quality of the images makes the Dimage 7i a very decent studio camera and an AC Adapter would be a must for this use.<br />Final thoughts: Buy it, and get the 500meg or 1gig microdrive... and a stash of rechargable batteries!","This is my 5th digital camera in approximately the last 4 years. The Dimage 7i a serious upgrade compared to the Nikon 990(3.34 megapixel) I was using. The Nikon is a nice camera, but the Minolta 7i has more functions and greater resolution.<br />Battery life was my primary concern prior to purchasing the Dimage 7i. That turned out not to be an issue using good NiMH rechargable batteries (1600mAh or above). I was able to get over 70 photos on one set of batteries. I would recommend using the electronic view finder vs the LCD monitor to conserve battery life.<br />Because the camera is 5 megapixel, have several memory cards at least 128MB, preferably 256MB or above. They fill up fast when using at the higher resolutions.<br />Take a few minutes to read the manual to learn the tricks of the camera, it is well worth it.","I have been an ameteur photographer for over 25 years and have been using digital cameras for about four of those. I have taken thousands of photos with my Nikon 990. I purchased the 7i mostly for the extended zoom capabilities. I have owned it now for over a month and find that it does everything I need it to do for nature, portrait, and sports (love the high speed 7fps feature) photography.<br />With all it's features and buttons, it is still easy enought for a novice to pick up and take some good snapshots.<br />Yes, it does use up batteries. So does my Nikon. I seem to be able to make it several hours (with the camera going into sleep mode when unused for more than a couple of minutes) before changing them out. I don't see what the complaint is. I keep a spare set of 1800 mah NiMh AA batteries handy, and it never really becomes an issue. It takes less time to swap out batteries than it would to load a roll of film.<br />Update: I have been using this camera for several months, and I appreciate it even more now.  Minolta really did their homework with the ergonomics on this camera, as I think the comfort and feel of the grip has helped me take more steady shots.<br />It went with me to Alaska where I took over 500 outdoor photos.  The camera stands up to serious use and not a bad exposure or out of focus shot in the bunch.  Great telephoto & action shots at my nephew's soccer game.  Built-in flash is more than adequate for almost all shots but I have used the 7i with Minolta's 3600HS flash for some long shot (10-20 yards) night photography at the auto races.","I have used this camera for 8 months, shooting in a variety of situations.  I have found it to perform extremely well in all respects except three.  First and foremost, the focusing speed is too slow in many situations.  Second, the manaual focus/autofocus button is placed where it is too easy to press it accidentally.  Third, I find that the video viewfinder seems to somewhat compromise overall ease of use and speed of operation.<br />I would rate the quality of the optics and general construction and design as very good to excellent.  Enlargements of 11\"x14\" are easily comparable to first quality 35 mm prints.  Also, the range of the lens (28-200 35mm equivalent) is truly outstanding, especially considering the small size of the lens.","I researched many cameras in stores and on line.  I wanted high pixel, lots of zoom and movie with sound.  Nikon 5700 with 8x zoom is more expensive and was not available.  Nikon 5000 does not compare in the zoom.<br />I was sold on the Minolta.  I am still experimenting with all the amazing features.  Automatic does a great job.  I recommend reading the manual several times,,,, actually I study the manual and then practice on the actual camera.  I bought an AC adapter and run an extension cord and practice on that and not use up the batteries,plus walk around the rooms taking pictures connected to the AC adapter...<br />This camera is like buying a small computer. I love it.  It is the best buy out there for a 5+ pixel with the 60 second movie with sound.  I love the macro switch for close up work! There is even a menu to shoot black and white if you need to do some art work.  You can change so many variables and even label your files that will come up on the PC when you download. In the LDC screen there is a small keyboard that shows up so you type in your own name to a photo file.  I also bought a compact flash reader that connects to your USB and I don't even have to download from the camera. Plus with my printer I can just put in the card and print directly. I also bought a compact flash card with more MB.  It comes with Sanyo rechargeable batteries and the recharger.  I can't say enough about how please I was to find this camera.  And actually a review like this about a Dimage 7 helped me realize the Dimage 7i is the newer model with sound for the movie! The investment of $1000 is worth it.  This camera's technology will be around for a long time. Have fun !!!","First: The Photographic Quality is first rate.<br />Fine controls to get the right photo that you want when you need it.","After almost a year of waiting, I finally bought it. I have been doing an intensive research about the Minolta Dimage 7 regarding its performance and how user friendly the camera is. And I keep coming to the conclusion that this camera is well made. The picture quality is superb, very high quality. It color saturation is excellent and the picture detail is true to life.<br />The camera was designed to look and feel like a 35mm single reflex camera. It has a 7X optical zoom, which make a big difference if you are comparing zoom quality. As always, to me optical zoom is far better than digital zoom. Another nice feature to the camera is its manual zoom mechanism. This gives you a better control when zooming. The lens also has an adapter thread ring so you can add a whole lot of filters and lens effects. The option to add a flash is another nice option that the Minolta people added to this camera.<br />One of the biggest complains to the Dimage 7 is that it consume batteries like a child eats candies. Its not the end of the world. Think positive. There are battery packs and rechargeable you can buy if you are not happy. But the best thing about the battery situation is it uses AA batteries and if you ran out, you can always go to a corner store and buy some. Or better yet, you can always take away that batteries you gave your kid for their hand held video games.","After almost a year of waiting, I finally bought it.

Unfortunately it's not true. I wish it would be. This camera is worse in low-light shots than the competition. Believe me.<br />It's your decision: if you can handle this, buy it, because otherwise it takes excellent pictures in normal lightning conditions.

First I would like to mention that digital cameras are still a long way from matching quality of the better film cameras using 35mm slide film and no where near the potential quality of medium and large format cameras, so you need to take that into account and consider what you will be using it for.  When I purchased this camera in June 2002 it was the cutting edge CyberShot.  I immediately dumped the 16mb memory stick and picked up the largest available (and still to this day) 128mb Memory Stick as well as a couple extra lithium batteries.

They've produced a smaller MemoryStick version thats half the size but has an adapter to make it work but still none of larger capacity.

You can also set it down to 640x480 and get like 1500 pictures on to that same 128mb card so theres a lot of flexability depending on your needs.<br />Its a great camera if you need something compact and good enough to take pictures of things in every day life for instant digital gratification.

The only setbacks of this camara are the expensive Sony accessories but other than that it is a great digital camera for the money.  If you want to save some [money] buy the Lexar memory sticks which work just fine and give you more memory for the dollar.","This Camera is better than advertised, you can take great photos on ALL resolutions plus as much video as your cad holds, buying a 128MB card is a must, but the size, weigth and 4.0MP definition ake it one of the best cameras around.","There are a lot of nice things about this camera that are mentioned in the other reviews.  I just want to alert you of some of the drawbacks that lead me to give it three stars.<br />1.  The autofocus is slow and there is significant delay from when you push the button to when the photo is taken.<br />2.  Pictures of things in motion come out blurry.  For example, I took the camera to the park with my children and photos of them on the slide, swing etc. all came out blurry.<br />3.  The battery dosen't last very long if you use the LCD display and the flash.  If you buy the camera, you should get the extra battery.<br />4.  If you are using the flash, it takes about 30 seconds for the flash to recharge between pictures.<br />These might seem like small things, but I've been using the camera to take pictures of my children and it seems like I miss the nice shots because the camera hasn't focused or I'm waiting for the flash to recharge or my kids look away between the time that I push the button and the picture is actually taken.","I got this camera over a year ago and I have not regretted it. It is compact, takes great photos with high detail, and it is not hard to use. While there are some downfalls (average close up focus and poor low-light capabilities), I find that these are not things that routinely prevent me from acheiving great photo quality. As for reasonably close-up photos, I use this in my dental office to take close-ups of smiles, and they turn out great. That should give you some idea of this camera's abilities. Many reviewers have hit the nail on the head regarding this product, so I will use my review to give you guys some great tips I've found.<br />1. Buy the 128 Mg card, the carrying case, card reader, and an extra battery.<br />2. Dont buy the charger. I find that if I have an extra battery, I usually get all the photos I need by just popping in the fresh battery when the first is low. Later, I charge the batteries with the camera's built-in charger. I actually bought the stand-alone charger, but it seems to take longer and is pointless since I am not using my camera at the time anyway.<br />3. If you are like me and want to carry your camera in your pocket try this trick to protect the LCD: get some of those Palm Pilot screen covers and cut out the size of the LCD, and then place it on your camera's LCD. The screen can get knocked by keys in your pocket and not get permanently damaged. Plus, you'll never run out of covers because one palm sheet can make 4 lcd covers.<br />4. If you have a still shot to take in low light and don't want to drown out the subject with a flash, use the SCN feature to recover some detail. But it only works if nothing is moving.<br />If you are looking for something to have on your vacations, birthday parties, and in the home that takes high res pics without the complexities and hassles of bulkier digitals, don't hesitate to buy this one. You'll be happy with it.","I have had this camera for approximately 3 months now.  I think it takes fabulous pictures.  The battery life is good and info on the battery life via the user interface is dead on.<br />It is compact and very simple to use.  The features are so easy to use that I really never needed to read the instruction manual.  I did a considerable amount of research before I made my purchase -- it has paid off.  I couldn't be happier with this camera.  I am not an expert photographer or anything like that -- just a guy who wants to get great pix at his family events.  This is a great camera for this.  One thing I need to note is that I have a very nice printer, cost more than the camera.  It would seem to me that this would have a lot to do with my quality of photographs -- just something to keep in mind.","I just bought this camera on saturday after researching it for about 2 months.  I quickly narrowed my choices between Cannon Elph 230 or this one.  I loved the look and feel of the Sony as well as the option of storing the images on my Clie.  The image quality is fabulous!  I was really impressed with the ease of use and the options given at your fingertips.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the fact that everywhere I tried to buy it in the last month were sold out.  :-)  I was even told from one of the places that it was discontinued, but that proved wrong.  They now have it in stock.  This camera is a MUST GET!<br />I do recommend, like most that have posted, that you get the spare battery and extra memory.","I love this camera, size and picture quality wise. I did a lot of research and I chose this over the Nikon or Canon because I wanted an underwater housing for it and one wasn't available for those at the time. ... I have tried to get one from Sony but have been unable to do so because I live outside the US. The quality of the pictures is great and I often crop and blow up sections and the quality is still great, although I don't have other brands to compare to. My main problem with the camera is that so few of the features that I want to change from picture to picture are available manually (i.e. on the menu screen)e.g. high, normal or low level flash; Center focus or multipoint focus etc; portrait, macro or landscape mode; twilight, full-sun or shade, most of these features cannot be manually set by the dial on the trot. While scanning through menu features on the screen you miss your picture moment. There is loads of space on the manual dial for these features to be added on the next model of this camera and then I would give it 5 stars. I think if you change settings often another camera might be better. I didn't think that so many basic settings would be unavailable by manual dial. I am still trying to get the underwater housing.<br />I would now add that I was finally able to get the underwater housing from Amazon and love it.  I am finding the lack of quick change from flash: (off, on, auto, red-eye, low, normal, high) a particular irritant especially since, as I have now realised that low light pictures are not that great.  Outdoor pictures however, are superb, especially pictures in and around water, which given where we live are the majority of my photos.  Red-eye is turned off and on from the setup menu, a major pain and so I rarely, if ever use it and choose to correct red-eye by software.  Low, normal and high flash levels are turned off by the menu, again a pain!  I think they should all have been alterable using the flash on, off, auto button on the back of the camera. I am still working on finetuning the manual controls to get better indoor/low-light shots.  I hope the new DSCP-10 has improved on these things.<br />Unlike another reviewer, I have been able to take excellent macro photos of orchids and butterflies, I'd say as close as about 10 inches.","I'm a snapshot guy - not a photographer.  I have 3 children and love taking pictures.  This camera is totally appropriate for my needs. You don't need 6 letters before your name to set the thing up. I set everything to auto.  Pictures are crystal clear, the zoom range is surprisingly good, the flash does its' job without leaving my pictures dark or having them look like they were taken during a nuclear explosion.  I have meaty hands and have no problems using the menus/controls.  The buttons look small but are well placed and easy to navigate.  The size of the camera makes it a non-issue to carry.  I now keep my camera in my shoulder bag all the time.  It's no longer a specialy item.  You will want to buy 3 extra things:<br />128 MB Sony memory stick (Yes, over priced - get over it because the camera is worth it)<br />Extra battery<br />Camera case","I just purchased this camera for myself as an early christmas  gift and I'm so glad that I did, becasue I love it !!! It's my first digital camera, and I'm very impressed with it. The picture quality is excellent, once you master the white balance and flash controls.  It's so ultra light weight and so compact, that I find mayself carrying it everywhere with me.<br />Make sure to take advantage of the ... coupon offer for online registration which is included in the box (the accessories catalog).  Simply go to the Sony website listed and once you register your camera online, you get a coupon to purchase accessories and save big time !! I got the Stamina Value Kit (soft case, memory stick holder case and one battery) for a great discount using this offer.  Don't pass it up !!! It's good on all accessories for this camera - even the nifty mouse that has a memory stick reader slot built in, so you can transfer pictures to your PC in a snap through the mouse. VERY COOL !!!","If you are able spend another 250 USD and get following items:<br />Sony BC-VC10 Dual Battery Charger for NPFC10 Only(Original charger charging thorough camera and you could not charge your camera everytime on safe please)<br />Sony NP-FC10 Info-Lithium Battery for DSCP3/5 (You should add another hour to your shooting experience.)<br />Sony LCMPX Semi Soft Carrying Case for DSCP3/5 (Save your camera and bring to everywhere)<br />SanDisk SDMS-128-822 128MB Memory Stick Memory Card (Most important one, 16MB is nothing)<br />Dazzle Multimedia DM-8100 Memory Stick Reader (Make your life easier)<br />Memory Stick Carrying Case(Safety)","Very impressive indeed!. I spent a long time going through the reviews, trying them in the shops and found that NONE of the cameras currently on offer is perfect! This, however, is the **best** ultracompact around.<br />This one provides excellent, sharp images even in low light. It is also very easy to use and is robust.<br />The white balance on this camera is dead on - unlike many others than cant adjust properly under fluorescent or regular lights, and so the colours on pictures taken are exactly right.<br />I like the fact that you dont have to take out the battery every time to recharge it - and that the info-lithium system tells you exactly how much shooting time you have left<br />And that the red-eye problem is negligible, compared to other ultracompacts.<br />And you even get a bonus email-able picture every time you press the button : no more resizing in photoshop...<br />A camera to grab and take with you anytime!<br />This one has a strong flash as well. I printed out my A4 size (8x10) pictures and friends thought they were from a shop!<br />I like the skin colours, and you can adjust the sharpness for a softer look on portraits. Nice sexy body as well....:)<br />Treat yourself and get one for Christmas! I did ,<br />I also got an HP 130 photoprinter! Just select which photos to print on the canera, then stick the memory stick right into the printer, press \"print\" and hey presto : lab quality 4 x 6\" photos right away! No computer needed & no messing about<br />Good one : Its a SONY","I love this thing.  The pictures are so crisp.  I had a 2.1 megapixel camera and was worried that there would not be a huge difference but I was wrong.  There is no fuzz or anything.  The pictures look amazing and the camera has tons of features.","If you are looking for a digital camera that produces a quality not just for a website purpose, this is the one for you. You can have it for fun or for professional use. It's indeed light-weight, easy to operate, and give you a very sharp picture quality. You can use it as well to produce a short MPEG movies and share it with your friends. To make a better use of it, you should buy extra battery life and a memory card. Indeed it is a great buy!!!","I've been using this camera on my travels as well as at home, and I love it. I'm a shutterbug and enjoy the point and click type cameras, but this camera lets my photographer roommate manually set just about everything he needs to when he's at the helm.<br />My favorite part is the rediculous amount of video with sound that this baby can record with a 128meg memory stick. I get 90 minutes of video and audio on the one stick. Imagine when/if Sony comes out with 256 or 512MB sticks!","I've had my camera for over a month now and almost everything about it is incredible. The picture quality is outstanding and you have a range of resolution choices. The camera is very small...just smaller than the size of my hand, and features including picture editing on the camera(like zooming in and cutting on that zoomed-in part) is handy. You can also record mpeg movies(about 3 mins. w/ a 128mb memory stick), but you don't have light from the camera while recording. The battery time is over 1 hour fully charged, which is more than enough with the memory they give you. I purchased another battery because I'm one of those that has to have everything perfect.<br />Only cons w/ the camera is that it only includes a 16mb memory stick(which only takes 8 pictures on the highest resolution), so I purchased a 128mb one. The wait-time between shots could be shorter(about 5 secs.), and the zoom could be higher(6x optical). Lastly, they do NOT provide a program to do more enhancing or editing. My uncle has a Canon and it came w/ a good editing feature program(photostitch) that will combine a number of pictures together and form 1 big one. Its good for taking big pictures/big families and panaromic shots.<br />Overall, I'm impressed with the size and features of this camera, but the price may be too steep for 1st-timers.","I read various reviews of this camera at photography sites and most expressed concern over it's picture quality in low light.From my experience with this camera I never see a problem with that. I think this camera is for people who like super compactness in stuff they carry around and at the same time has decent quality.<br />If you are looking for stunning quality pictures no camera this size can take them. But this one is capable of taking pictures good enough for an average dad and mom who love taking simple, yet decent quality pictures. I took over 300 pictures and there are only a few of them I can complain.<br />If I have to buy all over again, this one will be an easy pick for it size, quality, and style. Oh! don't forget to get the camera bag(Model: Sony LCMPX) specially made by Sony for this camera. It's a perfect compliment to this camera and has great style.","I absolutely love it! I won't list specs in this review, but I like the fact that you can record audio/video and the limit is your memory stick. Also handy is the quick review of the last photo in the same settings you are in vs. having to switch the dial to the 'review' mode.<br />I would highly recommend a 128M memory stick. 16M fly quickly especially in High Resolution.<br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the zoom capability.. Don't let the digital 2X fool you. I would recommend sticking to the 3X optical zoom to get good photos.<br />Also if your hands are big, get a bigger camera.<br />A bientot.","This is my first digital camera. Since we got it couple weeks ago, we use it almost everyday. It is so compact and you can carry it everywhere. The photo quality is good. I really like the movie clip feature and its quality is better than we thought. The default flash mode is \"no flash\" and it's a little bit annoying. There is no notible problem other than that.<br />It's a great camera and I really recommand it.","This is a very good camera. It can let you take a perfect picture, movie, or sound. The LCD is so clear, you can see almost exactly what the object look like. You can review your picture and delete the one you don't like. Everything is just perfect. I suggest everyone don't buy a film Camera anymore, it is useless now.","I purchased this camera and instantly purchased the 128 card to go with it.  Within the first day my four-year-old and I were able to take pictures and easily navigate the menus to try different features.  I printed my pictures up to 8 x 10 and the photographs have excellent quality.<br />This one is a keeper.","After doing a lot of research on digital cameras to replace my aging Fuji MX-1200, I decided this seemed like the best one for the money.<br />With the 4 megapixels you can even use the digital zoom without worrying about sacrificing too much picture quality -- though the 3X optical zoom will suffice in most cases.  The picture and movie quality are both very good (sound quality is also surprisingly good), though movies tend to come out dark if you're shooting indoors without a lot of sunlight (though, for a still camera, I haven't seen much better).<br />The one thing you'll want to familiarize yourself with is the manual brightness settings.  Pictures indoors with sub-par lighting will also come out a bit dark on normal settings, but if you adjust the brightness manually (using Sony's easy-to-navigate menu system) it won't be a problem at all.<br />The camera also has both USB and A/V out jacks for displaying pictures/movies on your computer or TV -- which are both pretty much plug and play processes.<br />One last thing -- as is the case with all digital camera -- is that you'll want to buy a bigger memory stick than the one it's packaged with (16 MB).<br />Overall, an excellent camera.","A great camera although it may seem a little pricey. The pictures look great even at the 2 Mpixel setting. It's great that the only limit in recording videos is the size of the Memory Stick, even on the highest image-quality setting (MPEG HQX). I noticed that a lot of digital cameras limit your recording time. Before you buy the DSC-P9, however, consider that Sony is coming out with comparable Cyber Shots in terms of features: the DSC-P2 (2 Mpixels) and DSC-P7 (3 Mpixels). They go for [price] and [price] respectively. You can see them at [URL] by following the links to digital cameras.","The Sony DSC-P9 is my second digital camera. I only have it for a few weeks now, but I have to admit, this loaded little gadget is a great companion. Not only is it small enough, but with it's solid Aluminum body I really have it in my pocket most of the time.<br />No need to repeat all the technical specs here. Overall the camera has an excellent price/value ratio.<br />Be sure to buy enough 128M sticks ... you will play with MPEG-HQX, be warned. The video editing software included only creates MPEG-1, so don't forget to download VirtualDub (free software, GPL).<br />Have fun and great shots!<br />Jan","This is my first DIGITAL CAMERA, and it is truly AMAZING!  The picture clarity is unbelievably crisp, and the 4.0 megapixel SUPER HAD CCD provides stunning detail and clarity...You CANNOT find a better looking camera that is so small, it weighs only 7.5 ounces WITH the battery, strap, and memory stick installed!  You can also record high-quality movies at 16 frames per second only limited by your memory!  The SONY DSC-P9 is small enough to carry around in your pocket, and the necessary accessories to purchase are the 128 MB memory stick, an extra battery, a protective case, and if you are an avid photographer... the SONY underwater marine pack.","Sony's DSC-P9, released in June 2002, is the state of the art in terms of resolution and features in a very compact camera, with point-and-shoot ease of use.  At just 4-1/2 x 2 x 1-1/2 inches in size and 7-1/2 ounces with battery, this is a camera you can take anywhere - so you will have it with you and take more pictures.  It's smaller and lighter than many less powerful cameras, and smaller than earlier generations of Sonys.  The camera and features give you that feeling that they have really been carefully thought through and designed for ease of use, though it does take some effort to learn to use.<br />Features include:<br />- The 4 megapixel (million pixels, or MP) resolution (2272 x 1704) is at the high end of consumer cameras, and should allow very good enlargements up to about 8x10.<br />- The 3x optical zoom will help you compose good photos and make the most of your pixels.  The zoom lens is the equivalent of 39-117mm on a film camera, so will go from slight wide angle to moderate telephoto.  It's a very versatile range, though not wide angle enough to shoot wide shots in small rooms.<br />- The lens aperture (opening size) is rated (max) at F2.8-F5.6 (depending on zoom; low numbers are better). This is fairly \"fast\" for this type of camera, making it better in low light than some.  The autofocus illuminator and the Twilight modes also help for low light situations, which challenge all digital cameras.  However, you will find it much easier to get crisp shots when the lighting is good (or the flash is used).<br />- The DSC-P9 takes great pictures without requiring much thought.  But if you want, the camera gives you several white balance options; light sensitivity (ISO) settings of 100, 200 and 400; pattern or spot light metering; multiple focus modes (3-point, center, manual at pre-set distances); shutter speeds down to 1/2000; and a macro focus setting for great close-ups from as little as 4 inches away.<br />- Other features include video out, to show pictures on your TV; and a metal case and metal tripod mount.<br />- The computer drivers should allow you to use a wide range of PCs and Macs with this camera.  (Windows 98/98SE/ME/2000 Pro, XP Home/Pro, MacOS 8.5.1/8.6/9.0/9.1/9.2)<br />For most users, this is all the digital camera you will ever need, in a compact package, with easy to use features.  It's not for everyone, though:<br />- If you want maximum control over your photos.  Direct manual controls are limited, though if you use the features wisely you have some control.  Also, there is no option to save photos in uncompressed format; and no lens thread.  Consider the Canon S40 if these matter to you; the S40's image quality is also slightly better.  The Sony DSC-85 will give you even better photos.<br />- If you mostly shoot snapshots, and never print enlargements, you probably don't need 4MP.  You can save some money by getting a 3MP camera like the Sony DSC-P7 or a 2MP camera like the Canon S330 or the Sony DSC-P2.  But having the extra pixels does give you more options, and allows you to trim the picture and still have good clarity.<br />This camera shares many of the issues all digital cameras have:<br />- You will have to buy more memory.  A 128MB stick will get you about 75 photos at maximum quality, and 2-3x more at snapshot quality.  Sony \"Memory Sticks\" are more expensive than other formats.<br />- Start-up and shot-to-shot times are slower than film cameras.<br />- The flash on a camera this size cannot match an external unit, but it is rated up to 13 feet, better than many compact cameras.<br />- The viewfinder (for when it's too bright to use the LCD, or you're saving power) takes some getting used to, as far as what is in and out of the actual photo.<br />- The MPEG movie feature is low-resolution (320x240), so of limited use, though this Sony can record audio and shoot any length (limited only by memory stick capacity).<br />- Battery life is very good for this type of camera - you can get 100-200 shots - but the battery must be charged in the camera (unless you buy the Sony charger, extra), so for very long days you may want a second battery.","This a great camera for anyone who ahs had some previous experience with digital imagery. it also can be a good beginner camera and build your knowledge by learnign the many features.","I get my firs digital camera about 10 years ago, it was an HP photosmart with almost a quarter o megapixel, since that time I have bought more than 10 different cameras, and thisone is te very best.<br />Easy to use, light, small, and take suberb photos. The only con. I found was that you have to charge the battery while its in the camera.<br />The price is good and the camera is the best in its category."]},{"name":"Leica Digilux 1","amazon_reviews":["OK, I admit that I am a sucker for the Leica name, but hey, it has meant quality and incredible optics for a very long time, so I had little difficulty choosing this camera last year when I decided to finally go digital.  After one year of use, I have nothing but praise for this camera.  Although I pine a bit for the Digilux 2, I am not ready to trade my Digilux 1 in and pay the premium.  As a digital rangefinder, with excellent automatic and manual aspects, I have been able to satisfy both sides of my hobby: the snapshot photographer and the advanced hobbiest artist.  The pictures I produce using this camera are stunning; the colors dense and true, and their ability to be manipulated in Photoshop a breeze.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone considering it ... at this price, you're getting a bargain!","I love my Leica. It is rock solid and it takes nice pictures. It is true that there are some noise problems in iso 200 and 400, but hey then I just use iso 100 for indoor shots. That requires longer opening times and can give blurry pictures, but usually I just set it to take 4 or 8 pictures at a time and then at least one of them is usually ok. Should I buy again I would probably go for Canon Digital Rebel which is almost in the same pricerange.","The true measure of this camera is the quality of the pictures it produces. Here's my take on the reasons this camera takes such stunning shots (and is worth the cost):<br />1. Button speed. You will actually capture the moment you are looking for with this camera. Most digital cameras take bland pictures because, well, what they are taking a picture of is not interesting and the moment has passed. With this camera your eye will tell you when the picture is right, and blam! You'll have it captured.<br />2. Lens quality. The blacks are blacker, the whites are whiter, the colors are richer. Things are sharper. Nobody can deny Leica produces top-quality lenses.<br />3. Feel good controls. The camera body is Magnesium and feels fantastic. With it in your hands, it has a tendancy to outclass it's wearer, like a suit that's a bit too expensive for the occasion. An interesting thing happens, you will try to take better pictures. Don't underestimate this effect. Due to the excellent simplicity of the controls, when you do try to become an expert, you actualy can because the camera doesn't get in the way or make you squint endlessly at onscreen menus to change settings.<br />These are three very simple things that combine to make a very unique camera. I don't believe you'll find all of these things combined in any other digital camera.<br />Some have said there's a strange pattern or pixelation when zoomed WAY in on images on screen. Two responses:<br />1. You aren't going to spend any time zoomed in on pictures on your computer when looking at them in a normal manner. At display resolutions, these pictures are as clear or clearer than any from Canon, or Sony comparable models.<br />2. This *may* actually be intentional on Leica's part. If you print out a picture from this camera, it is always stunning, even at full size or larger. Some liken this to a stochastic (look it up) printing process. Whatever the case, find a print sample your self from this camera, there's no denying the overall effect more artistic and is a cut above simiar competitive brands.<br />I have had zero issues with this camera since ordering it from Amazon 8 months ago. My only complaint is that the Digilux 2 is even better...","..if you aren't obstinately attached to the brand. Aesthetics apart ('big', 'boxy' come to mind) this is NOT the camera you should go for if you want anything beyond an ISO of about a 100 -- and this is not coming from a point-and-click amateur. Yes, the manual controls are charming but if alternative brands offer me a better device (primarily, better pics, i.e.) with a lighter price tag, I begin to question.<br />WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE DIGILUX:<br />(1) Very, very fast response times in its class. This alone could be a dream criterion for some of you.<br />(2) A spacious monitor on the cam, bigger than matching Olympus, Canon or Nikon offerings.<br />(3) The much vaunted manual controls, no need for reflex cams.<br />(4) The Summicron lens, which leads to good pictures if the only alternative you have owned is a Sony entry-level point and shoot. If you have ever worked with a Nikon D100 or a Canon G3 (or above) then the quality difference is minimally incremental.<br />WHAT'S NOT:<br />(1) The price tag. For me, just the name doesn't cut it.<br />(2) Sub-par battery life.<br />(3) .mov format for the movies? Why?<br />(4) Think about where you'll be getting your tech support. It's not very easy.<br />(5) The reference guide is a pain to comprehend.<br />(6) A lean 2x optiocal zoom, which is also a bit deceiving - the imaging chip is so small, you can almost NEVER achieve background blur for portraits, or any other form of professional photography.<br />(7) Where's the noise reduction that is so COMMON with other competitors?<br />(8) A hood for the lens would've been nice.<br />(9) WB when using a flash is too bluish green.<br />(10) Ugly body (ok, this is subjective) -- almost seems tailor made for big German hands.<br />(11) Where's RAW?<br />SUMMARY:<br />I know a Leica when I see one. If you're looking for a digi version of the M6, this isn't it. I wonder why other reviewers would rate a product based on the halo of its overall brand. I'd wait for a revised version of this offering from Leica, their lens is worth the wait. Meanwhile, consider Nikon D100s (or even 5700) or Canon's EOS (or G5 etc) if you are in the market for a digital.","This camera has exceeded my expectations of what any digital camera should be.  I was fearful during the purchasing process because I read \"pro\" reviews for this camera that were not favorable.  They complained about severe noise at ISO 200 & 400.  Luckily, I do not use these settings very often, I use a tripod and long exposures for low-light situations if I have to.<br />The real test occured when I held this camera for the first time--wonderful!  My favorite physical qualities of this piece of art are the well-placed levers (yes I said levers, much like a Leica M), manual focus/settings and magnesium housing.  The large display is very useful. I've gotten many + comments about the camera's superb design.<br />More important than physical prowess though, OPTICS.  This is what sets the Digilux apart from its competitors.  Fast and clear, enough said.<br />One last note, I bought the optional Filter Adapter at a local camera shop...  Ohhh, what I'm willing to pay for Leica quality.  With the adapter screwed on, the lense cap does not fit. This is a minor detail because filters offer protection and you can get an aftermarket cap that fits.  Soon I will add accessories (wide-angle lense, more filters) to increase the camera's photo possibilities.<br />It's truly first class.","Unlike many other digital cameras, the Digilux 1 has little or no perceptible lag between pressing the button and taking the picture, especially if you 'prefocus'.  Another nice feature is the multi-exposure setting, where you can automatically shoot 3 or 5 photos in rapid sequence, varying either the exposure by 1/4 to 1 stop increments, or varying the depth of field using different F stops.  Both approaches give you a chance to pick the best shot after the 'decisive moment' has passed.<br />A negative is that the smallest aperture seems to be F8, which impacts the depth of field available in closeup photos.  You'll also want to get a 256M card, the supplied 64M card holds only about 30 photos at medium compression.","The Digilux is a real value and wonderful camera for both the digital novice to the seasoned camera buff.  In my opinion the most important thing in any camera is the lens, and in the Digilux has the legendary Summicron.  I've had other several other cameras both digital and 35mm and this lens is a must buy. When matched with Panasonic electronics, we end up with the best of both worlds - the clear eye and great electronic brains.  From an over all value perspective, the Digilux while not inexpensive, is in my opinion a real \"value buy\".<br />I do reccomend that anyone buying this camera be prepared to invest several hours reading the manual. In order to unlock the massive potential of the camera, one must plow through the manual initially and over time.  The investment is worth it to unlock the amazing things this camera can do (too numerous to list).<br />Lastly I'd invest in a USB card reader, buy an extra flash card and keep this beautiful camera (it feels great in your hands) protected with a good case, otherwise enjoy!","First point worth mentioning: If you're looking for a pocket camera, look elsewhere. Check the dimensions on this, and then check your pockets. On the other hand, if you don't mind carrying the camera around with you, it will reward you IMMENSELY for the effort.<br />Designed as a reportage camera, the response is incredibly fast. It reminds me of the time I traded in my 133MHz computer for a 2.4GHz. I can't stress enough how fast this thing is. And not only that, but it's PRECISE. The optics are about as crisp as they get, and the CCD captures the image very well.<br />For me, the camera is completely automatic. For later, it has a manual override on everything. For the transition (while I learn more), it has shutter or aperture priority. This includes the best manual focus on any non-SLR digital camera on the market, by the way. It also has a macro focus that allows you to take wide-angle shots within 6cm of the subject. Also, the LCD is a massive 2.5in.<br />With automatic everything, manual overrides on everything, unlimited video (it'll fill your memory card if you let it), crisp and detailed images with no artifacts, a superior LCD viewfinder/replayer, classically gorgeous styling, absolute blazing adjust/focus/write/refresh/everything speed, and all of the other features I haven't time to mention, this is THE camera to have.<br />I shopped for several months, and after learning about this one, my interest in ALL other cameras just disappeared. The ONLY thing I could possibly agree is worth considering is Sony's latest top-end camera. It has excellent Carl Zeiss optics and both 5MP and 5X zoom (which outmatch the Leica by a small margin). It also has infrared night shots, which could be a fun feature to play with. It just lacks the speed of the Leica and costs noticably more (shop around and see). Not to mention it requires memory sticks, where the Leica has SecureDigital memory, which is smaller in size but still as large in capacity and is becoming more prevalent in a number of manufacturers.<br />You don't have to take my word for it, though. Read the rest of the reviews and check Leica's website for really detailed specs. Then shop around for the best price and GET the camera. Enjoy.<br />Addendum:  The more I use the camera, the more I love it.  A few features I've uncovered: Adjustable flash brightness (I illuminated an entire auditorium with it.  Amazing), camera saves preview image with every video for easy reference, manual is VERY comprehensive, Leica partnered with Panasonic (to provide the digital aspects) which in turn means Leica provides optics on Panasonic's cameras - if you don't want to pay this much, check out Panasonic's cams.<br />Finally, I found a great program for organizing and editing pics as well as creating several types of albums.  PhotoMeister.  Check it out.","I am very new to digital cameras (and photography) so my review will focus on ease-of-learning the camera and the way it handles.  I've now had the camera for about a month and have used it almost daily and am extremely pleased overall.<br />I had a minor moment of disappointment when I first got the camera and found it to be larger than I had expected (I hadn't seen one in person and was secretly hoping it would be Canon Elph sized).  I'm over the size thing now, especially since I love how ... the camera looks.  Yes, it's oh-so-retro in style, but when it comes down to it, the Digilux-1 could almost be out of the backdoor of the LOMO factory or something.  But I love it for that.<br />As a person who has no patience to read directions, I found it very easy to figure out what to do in terms of setting up the camera and taking my first pictures.  I was snapping away within 15 minutes.  Because the camera has so many nice adjustments in terms of how yr picture turns out, I find it easier and funner (yes, more fun) to play around with the settings on the camera rather than go for \"perfect\" pictures on the first attempt.<br />Hm, what else.  Oh, transferring pics to the computer (I have Windows XP) was a breeze, no software needed, and god bless USB.  Really now the issue is organizing all the photos I've taken!<br />Lastly-- this camera begs for a case, and not the ugly boring black leather one that Leica has decreed is appropriate for the Digilux-1 (Leica Digilux-1 case has a MSRP of $..., ugh).  I think they could have put a little more thought into the styling and features of a case for this gem of a camera.  So I did a little hunting and I'm going to try one of the Crumpler cases... we shall see...","Simple, direct, point and shoot. When I first handled this camera, I was struck by the boxy Retro shape. How unlike the rest of the digital camera field. The technical instrumentation is straight forward, the view area of 2.5 inches, the largest available was a selling point for this myoptic photographer. Having read some very positive professional photographic reviews and being an owner of a Leica film camera, I made the purchase solely based on Leica's reputation. I was not disappointed. Everyone who saw the  first batch of photographs I took were astounded by the image quality and detail. The high quality Leica Vario-Summicron lens justifies the higher price.<br />Having previously owned and used Nikon and Canon digital cameras which seem to get more complicated with every new model, this is the one I prefer over all others. There is no comparison when it comes to the final result.","OK, I admit that I am a sucker for the Leica name, but hey, it has meant quality and incredible optics for a very long time, so I had little difficulty choosing this camera last year when I decided to finally go digital.

Really now the issue is organizing all the photos I've taken!<br />Lastly-- this camera begs for a case, and not the ugly boring black leather one that Leica has decreed is appropriate for the Digilux-1 (Leica Digilux-1 case has a MSRP of $..., ugh).  I think they could have put a little more thought into the styling and features of a case for this gem of a camera.  So I did a little hunting and I'm going to try one of the Crumpler cases... we shall see...","Simple, direct, point and shoot. When I first handled this camera, I was struck by the boxy Retro shape. How unlike the rest of the digital camera field. The technical instrumentation is straight forward, the view area of 2.5 inches, the largest available was a selling point for this myoptic photographer. Having read some very positive professional photographic reviews and being an owner of a Leica film camera, I made the purchase solely based on Leica's reputation. I was not disappointed. Everyone who saw the  first batch of photographs I took were astounded by the image quality and detail. The high quality Leica Vario-Summicron lens justifies the higher price.<br />Having previously owned and used Nikon and Canon digital cameras which seem to get more complicated with every new model, this is the one I prefer over all others. There is no comparison when it comes to the final result.","Leica has spent nearly a century earning its reputation for quality.  They have missed their mark only a couple of times when they lent their name to inferior products.  The Digilux1 is the redeemer.  Alittle more bulky and a little more costly than competing products, but certainly, ounce for ounce, the best point and shoot digital out there.  On high resolution a blow up of 11 x 14 competes with most quality film cameras.<br />The design is somewhat retro, but so is everything else these days.  The processor is fast, the screen is big.  You will love it!","This ia a lot of camera, but the most  amazing photos I have ever seen.  I look like a pro now.  Best of all it is really cool.  How many people have a Leica, yet alone a digital one? It has a pretty heafty manual, and I must admit I am a little overwhelmed, but my husband knows what he is doing so I am in good shape.  If you can afford it , go for it."]},{"name":"Pentax Optio 230","amazon_reviews":["I bought this camera after reviewing several others for pleasure use only.

I was pleased with the quality of the images it took, and it took over 300 pictures on one battery charge.  It is a little bigger and heavier than a newer camera, and the screen was smaller, but I didn't have to worry so much about keeping it safe.  I recommend this as a camera for the cheapskate who wants good pictures.","I buy Canon exclusively because of this camera.  Have several other newer and better Canon's, but my 5 year old A40 still takes great pictures :).  Have taken over 16,000 photos with it over the years.  This is a real workhorse of a camera. And as you can use rechargeable AA NIMH batteries with it is a plus.  Don't think I'll ever get rid of it.  I know 2MP is not very good by today's standards, but really it's all you need for your average 4 x 6 print or for viewing digitally on your monitor/tv. Digital prints come out crisp, clear, with great color and contrast.  If you can get a good deal on a used one, grab it!","my family bought this camera as our first 'digital' camera. we all couldnt keep our hands off of it. about two years later i got my own smaller more compact power shot. and it worked well till it finally broke after going through some serious poundings from my liking to go to concerts, and it getting kicked by people crowd surfing.<br /><br />during the time it took me to save up for a new camera. i settled back with this one. taking it to local shows and things like that. i got amazing shots. (i like to leave the flash on and put it in multiple picture mode, and just let it shoot away) and it got the kind of picture i wanted. i got artsie moving pictures, that still seemed like a moment frozen in time, without them being blurry.<br /><br />as soon as i got my new camera and took it to a show. i realized that it didnt have that cool stop action like the older camera did. when the fash was off.<br /><br />my very next show i resorted back to this one and i still use this one when i want to do fancy shots. i could do with more MP's , but its ok. i'm still very much in love with this camera. years later. and yes. everyone thinks i'm crazy for lugging around this huge thing. but i dont care. i show them the pictures i took with it, and they shut up instantly.","I've been using the Canon A40 for more than a year (see my posted sample pictures). The first time I printed my photos at their highest resolution (1600 X 1200) I was NOT very impressed due to my cheap HP color printer, but when I took them to the nearest farmacy for a more professional printing I was really impressed with the Kodak Picture Perfect processing and the quality paper.<br /><br />After using my Canon AE-1 film SLR for more than 15 years I never thought that a little 2MP camera will look this great on 4X6 prints. They really look good as long as you take pictures outdoors.<br /><br />As expected, in low-light conditions it performs poorly but if you put it on a tripod and use the night-scene setting with flash you can still take great pictures of static or slow-moving subjects.<br /><br />This is a great quality camera for the price range but considering it's discontinued now, you may want to consider a Canon A410. As for me, I'm replacing my AE-1 with a Rebel XTi.","I purchased my Canon A40 PowerShot about 3-4 years ago and never had a day trouble with it. I have taken 1000's of photos with it, I use it on the job and off the job, and I realy don't know what some people are talking about the lens giving trouble, maybe they camera fell and that will definetly cause that to happen. My A40 PowerShot was a good buy and it still works VERY GOOD.<br /><br />The only reason that I will buy a new camera now is to upgrade to something with more pix and more Zoom.<br /><br />BUY ONE NEW, IF YOU GET IT AT A GOOD PRICE AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. TRY NOT TO BUY A USED ONE.","It's outdated & unavailable new but I still think the Canon A-series line is the best balance of features, ease of use, & price.<br /><br />My A20 is still going strong after 2 years and 3000+ photos. It has been thousands of miles by automobile & aircraft and still takes excellent shots.<br /><br />There's 3 cons that keep these from being the perfect camera:<br /><br />1. Finger-press to shutter time is just no good for those truly candid shots. It's hard to catch people in natural states while you wait for the camera to autofocus, fire off some anti-red-eye bursts, then finally snap the scene you just missed... You become well-trained to almost prophectic-like preparedness for moments like candle-blowing or most any kid action. Adults are far more camera-aware anyway, so an SLR is still the best way to go for any action requiring fast reaction times.<br /><br />2. Weight. It's a mixed blessing since it comes mostly from the 4 AA batteries (ONLY USE RECHARGABLE, PEOPLE!) that allow you to go long between changes.<br /><br />3. Size. It's barely pocketable in loose pants. And then it pulls your pants down. You won't be hiking or even just walking around much without a good belt (or suspenders). So be prepared to carry it by hand (good for quick snapshots) and/or stowing it in a camera bag/pouch.<br /><br />I use a LowePro D-Res 25 AW bag which is bigger than absolutely necessary, but has MORE than enough space for a backup set of batteries & memory card, the A/V cable (in a perfect interior slot), shoulder strap, velcro belt strap, and an attached (but hidden) rain cover. Plus it's very well padded. It could fit the data cable too, but I don't carry that myself. Overall it's more of a (travelling) storage than everyday portage pouch.<br /><br />I guess that's a bonus review of the pouch.","Since purchasing this camera, film has become a thing of the past for us, something relegated to the realm of VCRs and record players. It's fantastically easy to use, and 2MP is more than enough for users interested in printing out nice 5x7 shots (provided that you're shooting at high resolution). In the 18 months I've owned the camera, I've taken almost 2,000 pics, and have them all neatly organized on my computer and CDs.<br /><br />In summary, this is hands down a fantastic product.","I have been shopping for a digital camera for about 6 months now and was told that I should get at least a 3-4MP camera.  Since I had not been able to afford one yet, I borrowed this camera from my father and took it on vacation with me.  It was quick to learn, easy to use, convenient and had all the features I needed.  The most surprising thing was the quality of the photos when I got back home.  It self adjusted so well to different lighting and there isn't a single photo out of the 180 that I took that needs to be adjusted.  The print quality was crisp and smooth (I did not expect them to be since it was only 2MP).  I printed my photos to 4x6 and they are great.  I am really pleased with the camera and will be buying one for myself soon.  There is no need to spend hundreds of dollars more when this camera has everything the average person needs.","I searched reviews information and asked tons of ?'s before making my decision to purchase this camera.  And I am so happy to own it.  I am not an expert at digital or computer stuff and this camera was so easy to use.  I have replaced my 35mm & 110 camera with this camera.  I purchased some rechargeable batteries and a ac adapter & it has been great!  Very pleased!  I'm not one for reading instructions and I just read enough to operate, If I were to sit down and read the rest I'd be able to do even more with my camera.<br />This is the best camera out there!  Originally I was going to purchase the A20, but found that it was going to be discontinued so I went with it's replacement (and I love it!).  I sell a bit on ebay and this is a great easy to use camera that takes super pictures!  If your planning to purchase I'd purchase this camera or one of it's newer ones for better picture (I'm sure the newer ones of this brand are even better - but they will stick to the basics and keep it easy to use).  I paid more than what it's going for now, but that's technology for you.  Anyways, I rate 5 star due to easy use, small camera (can take to party's and such), and it's a great replacement (to get rid of those camera's that use film).  I have saved tons of money just on not buying film!","i have this camera and have also the Wide angle adapter kit. altho the wide angle adapter kit does not work with the flash (the wide angle lense blocks about 70% of the flash causing that 70% to be unlit) you can still take wide-angle photos if there is good light and it works great without the wide-angle lens under all lighting conditions. i wish it had some better flash settings, but it takes decent photos and i use a USB CF adapter to archive my photos to my PC. i have used some of the advanced settings to take 15s shutter speed low light photos and things like that and was impressed, but mainly i use it for family photos. The batteries last a long time with the flash and the preview screen on. For more serious photos, i'd consider the PowerShot A80 or maybe a Digital SLR camera that records RAW data.","This is the first digital camera that I bought and almost 2 years down the road I'm still extremely happy with it. I originally bought it with minimal research (all I knew at the time was that I was looking for at least 2MP & an optical zoom) and the strength of the Canon brand name. I wasn't disapointed....<br />Furthermore, it's kindled an interest in digit photography and surprisingly, all of the extra controls and features I'm starting to learn - so I still haven't out grown this thing. The ZoomBrowser Ex software is fantastic as well. Prints lovely 4 x 6 photos on a Canon i860 photo printer, with the PhotoPaper Pro and Glossy paper.<br />This camera made me a convert to Canon products, I don't think you can go wrong!! Probably will update fairly soon with another Canon camera.","This camera is relatively easy to use and takes good 5x7 sized shots, though it pixilates out when you get larger unless you change the res.  Easy to download pictures and uses aa batteries so its easy to stay ready to shoot.<br />I have owned this camera for 1 year and 2 months and the mode dial on the back \"locked up\".  Could not switch any of the settings or even review pictures.  Called Canon, after I went through all the tech support, email, and faq options on the website, and was told that it was out of warranty and I must send it to a factory repair site. Did. It costs $115 to just crack the case and look.  Final cost could be more.  That is one half of the cost of a new one.  All for a camera that is barely a year old.  This was my fourth Canon camera (plus 1 video) since switching from Sony but will be my last.","Without wanting to spend a lot of money on a new digital camera, the Canon PowerShot A40 came highly recommended.  Whether you're new a digital cameras or not, you don't need to have any experience using this camera.  That's one of the reasons why I really like this camera.  Crisp, clear images, lightweight, compact. Loads of features. Records short movies. 2 megapixels.  What more could you ask for from a camera that's under $250.00","Although all the accessories for a digital camera add up to be a good amount of money (memory card, batteries, photo paper, good quality printer, or photot proccessing at the store), the quality of the pictures are worth it.  Plus, you can hold a ton of pictures on the memory card and delete the ones you don't like.  The camera is easy to use and simple to connect to your computer.  When I print out the pictures the quality is so good I'm not sure if it's because of the printer (hpphotosmart 1215), camera, or most likely both.  A great buy!","I love this camera we also own the Cannon powershot g2 but I like this one to through in my bag & go no bulky parts to get broken. This camera is handy whip it out & shoot it takes great pics. my favorite out of both of them.","At first I was real hesitant, considering my husband bought this for me and he is clueless when it comes to photography. I am semi/pro and was not thrilled to receive a 2 megapixel camera as a gift. I have got to say that I have been pleasantly surprised. The 4x6 prints have turned out with wonderful color saturation and great image quality. Depending on the type of paper used I have seen some pixels in the skin tones but the amateur eye would not even notice. I like that it can be switched to manual mode. I don't like that it only offers 2 aperatures with each shutter speed. This camera also can use conversion lenses for wide angle and tele although I havent' tried them. On my next vacation this will be my camera of choice over my 35mm SLR's. I only hope I don't need tele although I may decide to purchase it. Overall I have been very happy with this camera. One day I hope to own a super mega-pixel for my photography business.","This Canon Powershot is my first digital camera. I have always been a believer in the Canon camera, however, I was hesitant to move over to digital and held steadfastly to my old school Canon AE1. However, I must say that the change to digital has been an enjoyable one. This little digital camera is very versatile and easy to learn and use effectively to take great pictures. It has just enough functionality to not be cumbersome and the size is perfect for sightseeing or nature walks. I would suggest this product for anyone who is looking for a reasonably price camera that takes great pictures. The only downside I choose to mention is that the actual viewfinder on the camera can be a tad deceiving but the rest of the functionality is top notch.","Great camera for photographing people.  Also great for photographing anything on a sunny day. Overcast days or incandescent lighting shots though can be a real challenge. They'll produce bad focusing and some rough pixelation almost every time unfortunately. Nevertheless, you can consider it a 'happy camera' for the types of lighting that it works best in.","The A40 is an excellent point and shoot digital camera for the casual shot. BUT it has manual control that allows you to take shots that an automatic camera could never capture properly; like tough night shots. It also has a panaramic feature that lets you stitch multiple photos into one (it really works, and it's easy to do). The best feature I like is that it can use regular batteries in a pinch; however, the rechargable batteries last a long time (I recommend a good fast charger). And that's not all, it also has a 3X optical zoom (forget those digital zooms); AND it has an adapter lens cover to add a telephoto lens (optional). Even though this camera has only 2MP it captures great photos. For the price, it can;t be beat!!","I am a novice photographer, having switched to this camera from a point and shoot that only had wide angle and telephoto lenses. The following are my opinions of this camera after 6 months and about 750 pictures:<br />Good:<br />1. Excellent outdoor picture quality. If you have good light you can take pictures that stop action in mid stream and have very accurate color.<br />2. I mostly take pictures using the automatic mode or the program mode, which allows you to set the exposure, white balance, macro mode, etc.<br />3. The menu is easy to learn, although you can't navigate it quickly.<br />4. The lcd screen is clear and bright.<br />5. You can zoom in on lcd images to see if you've taken sharp pictures.<br />6. Using manual settings (and a tripod) you can take great indoor pictures using natural light rather than a flash.<br />7. You can take pictures forever using NiMH rechargeables, or if you do run out of juice you can always pop in some AA's.<br />8. The camera uses compact flash cards which are available everywhere and are relatively inexpensive.<br />9. The optional 2.4x telephoto lens is great for macro or portrait shots. I have taken some extraordinary pictures using this lens, as long as the subject is relatively close at hand. Gives that pro look where the image is clear but the background is out of focus.<br />Bad:<br />1. Indoor pictures with the flash are often a disappointment, with too much red in skin tones and a yellowish tint to teeth. Very unapealing. It's hard to get that red out of the skin with Adobe Elements and still have natural looking skin tones.<br />2. Focusing is often problematic. As there is no manual focus, you've either got to get the camera to focus on its own or you'll get a blurry image. The subject must have contrast in order for the auto focus to work. I often have to keep shifting forward and backward to get enough contrast.<br />3. The 3x optical zoom doesn't make much of a difference beyond a dozen feet or so. I purchased the optional telephoto lens which adds 2.4x to the zoom, but this is still no big deal. You've got to get close to your subject.<br />4. There is no bracketing feature. I never heard of this until I began learning a bit about photography. With it you can pre-set a variety of exposures and take several pictures in a burst, each with its own settings. This ensures that one of the pictures is likely to come out the way you want. Too bad the A40 doesn't have it.<br />5. The red eye reduction mode doesn't work. Red eye is still prevalent. There is no way to add an external flash so you're stuck with red eye like it or not.<br />6. The lcd screen is brighter than a pc monitor, or a print out of the image. Thus an image that looks properly exposed in the lcd will be underexposed if you view it on your pc or print it out. You have to adjust your expectations - if the image looks a little overexposed in the lcd it's probably just right in reality.","This Camara is great.  The wife and I finnaly got tired of our [junk] 35 millimeter camera... so we forked out the money for this model, a 128MB memory card, and some rechargable batteries.<br />We couldn't be more happy.  The picture quality is exellent.  About once a month we select the pictures we really like and take them to a store that will develop them onto photo paper for a fair price (much cheaper for us than buying a lot of fancy printers and such).  The results are far better quality than those from our 35 millimeter camera.  The color in the pictures is just great.<br />I had no idea digital pictures could be transfered to photo paper with such exellent results.  Toss your old film using camera in the garbage and get yourself one of these babies.","I got the Canon Powershot A40 in December of 2002 after researching these things for months. I chose on the A40 for its resonable price and capabilites. It has 6 differnt modes on its wheel but you go can go farther. You can take photos in B/W, Vivd, Nuetral,Low sharpining, and Sepia. Its movie mode is advertised to make a thirty second movie, but I have found it only takes about a 20 second movie. so now lets go to the pros and cons.<br />PRO's:<br />1)Price<br />2)Zoom capibilitys<br />3)Usability<br />4)Large LCD screen<br />5)Easy removal of unwanted pictures<br />6)Battery life<br />7)Software<br />8)Setup<br />CON's:<br />1)Shutter lag<br />2)Weight (See 2)<br />2(If you want a lighter camera look at its brother the A60)<br />Overal this is a great camera and I would highly suggest getting it.","I just wanted to buy a decent camera to replace the cheapo 35mm products that I seem to always lose or break.  No specialty photos, just family stuff and the usual normal snapshots.  The A40 was on sale, and a bunch of folks on Amazon spoke highly of it.  Best purchase I ever made.  Easy to use--just point and click, and you get excellent photos.<br />I made the mistake of buying a Canon i950 photo printer and some glossy 4X6 paper.  The picture quality is UNBELIEVABLE-- better than any I've ever received back from the local 1 hour photo (I know, because my wife RUNS the local 1 hour photo stand).  Now I'm buying digital photography books, playing with the advanced features of the camera, and evaluating photo software.<br />If you can find this camera, buy it!!!  But beware the digital photo bug...","Excellent digital camera for all purposes. Delivers great pictures with very good color and detail. User-friendly for even the amateur photographer. Camera is light and easy to carry around.Very durable. My friends are jealous how well my photos reproduce.","I purchased this camera about a year ago, and I love it!  It's easy to use, has intuitive controls and takes great photos!  When combined with a larger memory card (I put a 256 MB in mine), it will take more photos than you can dream of!<br />PROS:<br />  Movie Mode With Sound - Many cameras have a movie mode, but no sound...What's the point?<br />  2 MP - Great for starters.<br />  Effects - Shots such as Black and White, Sepia, and built in Sharpening mode make use better than just normal photos.<br />  Easy Use - Wheel selector on back of camera is GREAT!  Makes use a lot better than cameras where you have to select through a menu every time you turn it on.<br />CONS:<br />  2 MP is good for photos of just tooling around.  4 MP may be better if you want to print out digital photos (Cannon i950 photo printer is GREAT for that!!!)<br />  Movie Mode - Takes movies which are between 12 and 24 seconds (depends on temperature, I think).  Great for taking small movies IF the events you want to film are on cue when you press the button (Real life, I have found, is not!)  If you are more into longer films, then the PowerShot S45 may be better.<br />  I really like Point & Click photography.  Digital cameras require a bit of focusing time, which can result in a 2 or so second delay.<br />Overall, it's a great camera.  I am upgrading to the PowerShot S45 because of the longer movie mode and the 4 MP.  2MP is fine for home, but I use it at work also, and find myself needing more detail.<br />This camera is great for the price.  If you are a beginner and don't want to blow a lot of cash, I recommend this camera.  Once you figure out for yourself what you like and don't like, you can buy a new one to your likings, and give this one to the kids/family/whoever.<br />Misses the 5th Star because the movie mode is too short, and the delay in taking the photos.  Otherwise, GREAT!","I purchased this model several months ago and still very pleased with it's performance.  Like many digital cameras, you can go through many pairs of batteries.  However, you can extend your usage life if you invest in a few extra dollars in Energizer E2 batteries.  The camera itself isn't that heavy or bulky as it may appear.  For those who are a bit picker, the flash is very powerful on this model but still manage to get great photos.  This camera is highly recommended for those looking to have a camera to just have around.","It's not perfect, but it works very well. I like the double AA battery use, it increases the weight, but AA's are cheap and readily available, and the battery life is excellent. The extra weight and the lip-handle thing the batteries are in on the side is an excellent hand hold, and gives the camera a great feel. The camera as lots of manual settings for fiddling with, and it takes good pictures. There is a bit of noise in low-light shots, but that happens with any digital camera. One complaint: The flash lacks one important setting: the ability to make it trigger no matter what. For most people this isn't an issue, but for taking product shots for a web site and such it's useful for filling in some shadows and neutralizing the color. It only has an Auto Flash setting, Flash Off, or Red Eye Reduction. Otherwise it is superb. It is being updated with the A60 and A70, which I can only imagine being even better than this camera.","I got this camera because I bought a different one and when I took it back to Circut city, they only let me make an exchange. Best mistake I ever made. I really love this camera. I use it most everyday. Here are my Tips....<br />I like how it will automatically adjust its apature. But it sets it for the brightest part of the picture. So if your subject is in the shade, point the camera to just the shade and hold the shutter button half way to have the camera set for that light. Then you can take the pic with the subject in the shade and light.<br />I love the movie mode. It gobbles up a lot of disc space, but with a 128 mb CF you'll still have plenty of room. The AVI it produces is a compressed avi which Premiere 6.5 won't allow me to edit with. So I use my Easy CD Creator 5 Platium and go to its edit video mode. Then I load my compressed avi and output it to a MPG2. Then I can use it with my Premiere 6.5 to edit it with the pictures for a awesome slide and video production.<br />Great camera you will definitly be happy with.","This is my second digital camera - the first was a point and shoot Fuji 1.3MP camera.  For under 200 dollars, this is the best 2 MP camera you can get.<br />Construction:  There is no plastic except on the flash card cover.  It feels solid and fits perfectly in your hand.  (the s200 and others are too small to really be comfortable)  the battery compartment on the right side makes a great grip.<br />Optics:  The 3x optical zoom lens is a great plus.  On the down side, it does not have too many steps but then again, its not a prosumer camera.<br />AiAF does a decently good job in bad light.  Images are a little noisy but overall, a lot better than i expected from a camera like this.<br />Excellent color saturation and white balance and the resolution is better than most other 2 megapixel cameras.  I regularly get 4x6 prints and sometimes get 5x7 prints.  always brilliant results.  even the low light results are fantastic.<br />Battery:  The camera takes 4 AA batteries - this to me is a good thing.  Its all nice and dandy to have a custom rechargeable.  Till you are about to leave for the weekend and realize that you forgot to charge the baby up.  4 NiMH rechargeables last for ever in the camera and are not that expensive.  And if you do run out, every corner store you find will have AA's.<br />Manual controls:  The three modes : automatic in which you can use it as a point and shoot and leave your head at home.<br />program:  in which there are some preset modes to choose from<br />manual:  wherein you can control exposure, white balance, etc.<br />Bottom line:  Ask yourself realistically - 'am i really into photography or do i just like to have an expensive camera to impress my friends' - that'll tell you which camera to get.  for day to day use and 4x6 prints, there is no camera i would recommend over this one.  period.","This is not a professional level camera.  It is a casual users camera, and as such, it does an outstanding job.  It's nice and light, but not ridiculously small.  I've had other entry level digital cameras, and the photo quality on this one is very nice.  Also, digital cameras often show a great difference between where objects lie when you look through the viewfinder, and where they end up on the photo, because of the distance between the lens and the viewer.  The Canon seems to suffer from this a bit less than I've experienced elsewhere.<br />The use of compact flash is a big plus in my mind.  That particular storage method, according to some magazine articles I've read, is here to stay for the long haul.  Also, additional cards are inexpensive, and, of course COMPACT.  It's simply a media I like, and recommend.<br />The camera can make very short, web-quality videos, but to be very honest, I've not really found a use for that other than as a novelty (\"hey, look what I can do with my still camera.\")  However, we have a digital camcorder as well, so that might explain it.  If, for example, you had your A40 with you, and nothing else, and something remarkable was happening, being able to use the video could be nice.  BUT, it'll use up your whole card, so make sure you have extra compact flash with you.<br />As with ALL digital cameras, this one EATS batteries.  Take extras...and you must invest in rechargeable batteries.  They upfront cost will be made up in shockingly short time.<br />My only complaint about the camera might seem silly to some.  It's not as SIMPLE as some other entry level cameras.  It puts a bit more control in your hands (if you want it) and this makes for a longer and more daunting manual than usual.  But don't be put off, you don't have to use the manual exposure and such.  You can just be a \"dummy\" and let the camera do it for you.<br />On a side note:  over the years, I seem to end up with a lot of canon products, including camcorders and printers.  They have always been excellent, and when I've switched to other makers (from Canon printer to Lexmark, for example), I've ALWAYS been sorry I did.<br />At the time of this writing, the A40 has been discontinued.  If you can find it (I got my as a display model from BEST BUY), grab it.  If not, Canon has got a whole line of \"this year's model,\" and I imagine they are quite good as well.","For a starter, I have always been a big fan of Canon brand. But when I bought this camera, I even loved and respected the brand more. To say the least, Canon doesn't mess around, they don't make cheap devices. They have very advanced technology, especially when it comes to optics and photo-taking machinery. When comes to price, I have compared other brands, like fuji, nikon, olympus, within the same price range, none of them include in their cameras the same features this camera has. For instance, you won't find the video captuering ability in the othe brands with the same price. And if you like taking control of photo shooting, this camera will let you do that. You can adjust the shutter speed from as slow as 15 seconds to as fast as 1/1500 of a second. I guess that takes you beyond the amature to a creative level. You can also take pictures in low lights where other cameras cannot. The most amazing thing about this camera, which was mostly the main reason I bought it for, is the expandability. You can attach a variety of extra lenses, such as wide-angle converter, tele-converter for extra zoom, and macro-converter lense for close-up distance, which extend the limit of this camera. I took it to Niagra falls last year and took more than 250 photos and lots of video clips with sound using two 128MB memory cards, which I recommend buying, they area not expensive. I also recommend buying at least 2 sets of 4 rechargeable AAA batteries, it will pay off over the time. hope you can still find it.","The picture quality, ease of use and functionality make the A40 a steal when you consider the MSRP.  It will soon be replaced by the A60, which I assume will be of equal or better value.  The thing I love best about my A40 is the picture quality in low light situations.  I've taken pictures of bands that were playing in dark clubs and they came out wonderfully.  The shutter-like lens cover and retractable lens is great when you compare it with models that only feature a plastic lens cap.  When you adventure outside of the auto mode, you'll find some great features like the Effects menu that lets you manipulate color options and Continuous Shooting mode by holding down the shutter button.  Really cool stuff.<br />My only gripe (and it's a small one) is that I've had hit-or-miss luck with the red eye reduction feature.  But the software that comes with the A40 addresses that problem (for the most part).  The software, which is easy to install and use, also includes typical features such as cropping and stitching, so there's no need to go out and purchase separate photo software.<br />I looked at a bunch of entry level cameras and I'm so glad I went with the A40.  In addition to a set of rechargeable batteries and larger CF card, I recommend purchasing a card reader for downloading pictures to your pc.  Card readers are cheap, fast and you don't end up wasting you camera's battery.  Most of them plug right into your USB port and you're off and running.","What a lot of camera for the money!  Unbelievably clear pictures, awesome features, great flash, uses AA batteries which is especially great in a pinch (go ahead and buy rechargables and save!) really fun to use movie mode (with sound!) and cables to see movies and photos on TV!  This is actually my second - a friend recently dropped and broke the first one.  I shopped around and looked at all the ones in this price range and higher and just couldn't see buying another brand/type since I've been so pleased with this little camera....especially since it's now $50-$100 cheaper now than when I bought the original about 10 months ago!","If you research reviews on non-merchant sites, you'll come to the same conclusion.  Since all the other reviews pretty sum it up, I'll just add that ideally you should purchase a larger CompactFlash Card (128MB is the best value right now) and 2 sets of at least 1800mAh NiMH rechargable batteries.","This is a great camera.  It will please the point and shooter as well as the more imaginative photographer.  Some may think that 2MP is too little, but for most of us, it's just fine. Plus it takes great pictures at every resolution.  The price/value equation is very good. Other reasons I purchased this camera was it's superior ergonomics (Canon Elphs were too little for my big hands) and its use of AA batteries (do buy some rechargeables) which are universally available.  I also had a prior camera that used the CF card format, so I can recycle.","Here is a little background information:<br />I had spent months reading reviews and searching for the best possible deals.  I was weary of cameras made with flimsy materials, required \"special\" batteries, or came with horrible software.<br />But, I went ahead and purchased the Canon Powershot A40.  That was last spring, and I can honestly say I have never been happier with it.  I purchased a PNY 128 MB card, a Compact Flash Memory Card reader, as well as rechargeable batteries and the battery charger.  Definitely worth the investment.<br />There were (and still are) features that put this ahead of all the other cameras out there:<br />-Crisp photos (at 2.0 Megapixels)<br />-Wonderful software. Easy to use, easy to install.  Definitely keeps my photos organized.<br />-Excellent \"advanced\" features, such as Exposure, shutter speed, flash.. this list goes on.<br />-Sturdy camera.  It's been dropped a few times.  Not a scratch in sight.<br />Finally, I would just like to point out, that reading reviews is definitely a good way to find out the finer details of a product.  I could sugar coat my review, but I believe it's far more important to hear the truth about the product.  This is an excellent camera. Period.","After quite a bit of research, I decided the Canon A40 would be my first digital camera, and I am extremely pleased with my purchase. It's been a week since I bought the A40, and I still can't put my new toy down! The LCD is great. Controls are very easy to use. Camera takes beautiful pictures - I can't wait to receive my first set of prints! The only negative that I have found with this camera is shutter speed, but if I'm not mistaken that seems to be common with digital cameras as opposed to regular film cameras. It's not that big of a deal as I'm getting used to it already.<br />The Canon software is very easy to use, and I had absolutely no problem installing it on my system (Windows 98). I'm not extremely familiar with all the technical aspects of electronics so I'll leave that to other reviews. This is a great point & shoot camera that takes clear, vivid images. I highly recommend it!<br />P.S. Get a larger memory card & rechargable batteries!","I just purchased this camera after doing research on several different brands.  I thought I might like the Canon Elph, but when I held it in my hands in the store, I felt it was too small. The A40 fits perfectly in my hands and the controls are extremely easy to learn and use.  I look for easy to use when shopping for electronics.  I don't want to have to take a class to learn how to set the time feature on a a camara.  This camera is not only simple to figure out, it also takes fantastic photos.  I have taken action and stills with it and they look great on my PC.  I also purshased a USB port which makes uploading the photos very fast.  All in all I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a nice camera that is easy to use and affordable.  I waited six years to be able to buy a digital camera and I am very pleased with my selection!!","Don`t think twice, remeber Canon is Canon, and you'll get more than expect. Also, digital camera is not the only point, think about the software to handle your pictures...canon has it! excelent!","We bought the A40 a few weeks ago for 229.99 with a Viking 128MB card for another 39.95.  Wow!  So far it's been a great camera.  I had a trip to Monterey Ca a few days later so I took the camera along.  Took great pics.  It's very easy to use and shooting in the auto mode the picture come out great.  Shot in auto, Program, and Manual modes.  I had good results with all the modes.<br />I'm not a professional, so to me the images are superb.<br />Only thing I don't like is that in Manual mode, once you select a shutter speed, you only have 2 aperture choice. weird.<br />The users manual that comes with the camera is easy to understand.<br />Buy a set of rechargeables and a charger.  We bought a charger and batteries from MAHA.  With standard batteries and the LCD on, you'll be going through a lot of batteries.  With the LCD off, batteries last quite a while.<br />With the rechargeables, the camera goes quite a ways even when using the LCD.","Once you get a feel for the manual controls, you'll find this camera can take pictures anywhere, in any light.<br />The body of the camera feels sturdy and is very rugged.  The controls are easy to press and manipulate.  And, the LCD is bright and easy to see.  The viewfinder, like on most point-and-shoot cameras, is a little small, but still accurate enough to allow you to frame your shot.<br />The automatic settings are great for taking snapshots in most conditions.  However, the manual controls allow for unbelievable versatility and allow you to shoot in almost any condition.<br />The software that comes with the camera is easy to use and install, although I find it a little over-the-top.  It's a little too flashy for it's own good.<br />Overall, the Canon A40 is an unbelievable camera.","Though 3 and 4 megapixel cameras are becoming more popular, this affordable 2 megapixel camera is worthwhile for people on a budget. It easily pays for itself in film and processing costs. It is best for smaller pictures. I print 5x7's and they come out wonderfully. It's the only camera I use! I recommend buying rechargable batteries and a larger CompactFlash card to get the best from this camera.","Pros:<br />* Good price, good value<br />* Compact, easy to carry along<br />* AA batteries (use rechargeables)<br />* Easy to hold grip<br />* Prints on 8.5x11 Epson paper and Canon i850 wonderfully<br />* 2MP cameras are good enough for up to 8x10 picture print-outs; and this A40 is the one of the bests according to Consumer Reports and cnet.com<br />Cons:<br />* Take too long to focus, i.e. when I have the camera focused and flash ready, my composed pictures disappear, I missed many good picture compositions. I guess this is the drawback of digital cameras vs. film cameras.<br />* The frame you see when composing a picture is not exactly what you get when the pictures taken. Users have to get used to it to have the good composed pictures.<br />Overall: I like my Canon A40. I've taken so many pictures since I have my camera. I taught my 8 year old nephew to use the camera. Then, he took more than 100 pictures in one hour, faily well. This camera is easy to use and produce excellent pictures.  I usually carry this Canon A40 with me for casual shots.  For formal shots, I use my Canon EOS Elan II with 28-80mm lens.  After having this A40 for a while, I researched on cnet.com, tried to upgrade my A40.  I could not find other better choices, better values.","I just got this camera a week ago and I love it!  Wow... it takes great pictures for the point and click photographer in Automatic or Program mode (which offers simple adjustments).  Yet offers great features for the more advanced photographer in Manual mode.<br />In Automatic mode it takes great shots outdoors, indoors with flash, even low light without a flash.  For instance, I was sitting at our dining room table, with just candlelight and Christmas lights and it took a beautiful, balanced picture.  Like what you'd see on a greeting card.  Flame from candles not too bright, while darker details were in perfect balance.<br />It's easy to use, with a very intuitive menu system and clear LCD.<br />The Manual mode is great for getting even more control as far as shutter speed, exposure control, etc.<br />The camera focuses quite well, whether landscape, normal distance, even close/up macro.  I took a picture in Macro mode of a lit ornament on our Christmas tree from about 12\" away.  It captured the picture beautifully and in sharp focus!<br />Then there's neat features like PhotoStitch Assist, to create some amazing panorama shots.  I've even done a 360, then using the PhotoStitch software created a really cool QuickTime VR surround shot!<br />And the camera comes with *2* CD-ROMS loaded with great software.  Including PhoteExpression which does a fantastic job of red-eye removal, retouching, calendar and card creators.  Even Photo Fantasy!<br />The camera looks and feels solid.  I have no complaints.  The Canon A40 is absolutely light years beyond anything else in the 2MP range.<br />Boy, we're sure glad we got the A40.  It's an incredible camera to capture memories!<br />My only complaint... I wish I had this camera years ago!",".. and I just love it.  I had been looking to get a digital camera for some time to help me with my work in Photoshop and Web Design.  Getting pictures developed 1-hour and scanning was time consuming, expensive and wasteful (with discarded images that weren't useful).<br />I look at several cameras in just about every store witin 60 miles around me that sells them and decided I wanted this one for price/performance.  Many cameras were the same price or slightly cheaper but they didn't have the 2MP that I wanted or an actual optical Zoom.  A lot of cameras seem cheaper because they substitute digital zoom (which only enlarges part of an image) for optical zoom (which actually focuses on part of an image).  This camera has both and the optical zoom is vvery nice and the digital zoom is adequate.<br />The price is good, the performance and picture quality is excellent and it can take movies!  I love it!<br />Oh yeah, mine didn't spark or catch on fire either...","Nice sturdy feel to this camera.<br />Two words:  BUY IT","This is my first digital camera and I have been very intimidated about finally buying one, but I have always owned and loved my Canons, so this was an easy choice for me. I also read many reviews and this camera was at the top of the list in every category including durability. I love that this camera looks and feels like a normal camera. You can use the viewfinder just like the olden days. It is larger and has the heft of a camera, not tiny like some digital cameras.<br />Out of the box set up time was about 10 minutes. The instruction book begins at the beginning and is written in plain English with illustrations. No wonk-y mumbo-jumbo. Basically, you slap the batteries in, put the little memory card in its slot, turn it on and point and shoot. Auto focusing and flash make it SIMPLE!<br />I was in a quandry about megapixels. I wondered if 2.1 was too low for the pics to be sharp. A couple of years ago, that was the top of the line, now, 2.1 is prehistoric. I decided to go with the A40 and 2.1 as a learning experience because the price is so low and Canons are so great. I figured after a couple of years, I'd junk the A40 and get a super megapixel camera. WRONG! This is a keeper! The photos are absolutely beautiful and crisp, even up to 8\"X10\". The color is absolutely accurate! My dad is a Nikon snob and even he admitted that my Canon A40 did a much better job than his Nikon 2.1 megapixel!<br />You have the option of using the Auto mode, where the camera does everything but push its own button or you can use it like a conventional camera where you set the exposure, shutter speed, etc.<br />There are a lot of other settings to play with if you want to, like  making the colors more vivid.<br />I did invest in a 256MG memory card because I read that the 8MG one the camera comes with doesn't hold many photos. I have shot 200 photos without a glitch or erasing any to free up memory space.<br />I think that this is the greatest value and quality in a digital camera for any level of user that anyone could want. If you've hesitated buying a digital camera, I encourage you to make this your first digital camera. I expect to keep this baby forever!","When I saw how perfect digital cameras were for my needs, I knew I needed one. After weeks of research on which one to get, I finally decided on the Canon Powershot A40. A friend had recomended this one to me and its features seemed to fit my needs almost perfectly. I bought the camera at Best Buy with 4 accesories. I got the 128 MB memory card, a case, rechargable batteries, and a memory card reader. After 20 minutes of opening the box, I knew how to work the camera. It's incredible! With the memory card (which is completely necessary!) I can take more pictures than I will ever need, as well as a 30 second video clip. I am really ejoying this camera...the only complaint I have (which is minor) is the short battery life. Make sure you get rechargable battaries! The camera eats them up very fast.","After reading numerous reviews and magazines, I bought this little jewel. I am a total digital novice. All I did was put the batteries in, turn the camera to 'auto' and snap off 2-3 pics of my dogs. I removed the memory card, inserted into my new Epson 925 Photo Printer, hit a couple buttons (single, glossy 8x10) and 'print'.  I got an 8x10 that is incredible! No touch ups, no reading either of the manuals as yet and detail/color you wouldn't believe! I've shown them to various people who have 3 and 4 megapixel cameras and they are astounded also.  I compared to a print developed on an HP printer with a 3.3 Sony DSC75 and mine were more detailed, deeper and richer in color.  ... I'm hooked.","We got this camera as a gift, but I'd selected it after researching all available options. My wife is a pro photographer and I'm a pro computer geek, so I needed something to satisfy us both without  being too hard to use. At this price range, I don't think any other digicam can beat the Canon A40.<br />It offers excellent auto controls as well as manual options, although we rarely use these in our snapshot environments except to disable the flash. The optical zoom is satisfactory and we've not needed the additional (lower-quality) digital zoom yet. At the largest size, 1600x1200, the photos are easy to crop and suitable for printing using our inkjet all the way up to 8x10 resolution. Pictures are sharp (I'd skipped the Kodak cameras after reading their picture quality was only so-so) and colors are exactly what we see. The 10-sec high-quality movie mode (30-sec low quality) is a fun addition which we've used several times when a camcorder wasn't handy or justified.<br />The LCD screen is large enough to do its job, the photo browser is easy to use, and the buttons are easy to get to. We replaced the included 8MB CF card with a 64MB card, which is sufficient, although there are a couple times we wish we had a 128MB card instead. However, we can fill up the 64MB card and drain a single set of rechargable NiMH batteries at the same time -- we have two sets of 4 NiMH batteries, one in the camera and one in the charger, which suits us nicely.<br />I've plugged the camera into iPhoto on my Mac at home as well as Win95 and Win2000 PCs. Installing the software on the Windows PCs was a bit trying, but once it's there the camera integration works wonderfully. Both Mac and Windows users will be very satisfied.<br />Most of the time the camera is used in or around our home to take family photos, so two sets of batteries and 64MB of digital film is sufficient, but those who are often out and about should consider a third set of batteries and 128MB or more of memory. As a consumer camera, though, the Canon A40 is excellent and a bargain considering all it offers.","I researched digital cameras for over a month before I bought my Canon A40.  Had previously owned a digital Minolta S404 and was extremely unhappy with it.  My Canon is such a better camera and was half the price.  Has a great auto feature and also manual modes for the more advanced user.  I was able to take the camera out of the box and start shooting.  Very user friendly.  Also, the manual is easy to understand (if you even need it).  My pictures are sharp and clear.  I have three kids that I photograph and they are fast, my Canon can keep up with them.  The 3x optical zoom is fantastic.  Took great pics of my kids playing in the leaves from a pretty good distance away.  I highly recommend this camera.  Haven't had any problems at all since I bought it five months ago!!!","If you're looking for a digital camera in the [moderate price]range, this is the one.  I've done extensive research and no other comes close to the features and options that this camera offers.  Bottom line is, you'll produce excellent photos with this camera.  2M Pixel is more than enough if all you're looking for is great pictures.<br />A few things you should get if you buy this camera..<br />1) Get a bigger compact flash card (128M will hold 140 pictures in the highest resolution, 200 in medium, 400 in low).  I find that medium resolutin produces sufficient quality for 4 by 6 photos.<br />2) Definitely get NiMH rechargeable batteries and charger (8 batteries please.. 1 set for backup since camera requires 4 AA batteries)<br />3) Get an AC Adapter for transfering files and/or printing photos.","This Camera takes great pictures and has many options for the price.  It feels sturdy not flimsy.  Some photos in low light don't turn out too well.  Movie mode does not work very well (only 45 seconds!)  Easy to use great camera.","Overall, I have been very pleased with my A40, it takes great pictures, isn't too bad on batteries and with a 256mb flash card (about $100), it can hold about 400+ high quality shots.  My wife and I took it to Italy with us and took 700 shots(we have a 256 and a 128mb card).  I had previously owned an Olympus Digital...ok camera but terrible in low light, the Canon is much better!<br />Only suggestion, buy the biggest flash memory card you can afford.","I was never been a big photography buff, but this camera has made it possible for me to do more than I ever imagined, and has me thinking about where I should go next to take more pictures.  This is my first digital camera, and I found it to be easy to use and full of features.  I have used the videocamera capability at the beach and at other things, finiding videos will last about 20-25 seconds with audio.  I have upgraded my emmory card to a 128, and would definitely recommend that nothing smaller be used.  At the superfine resolution I am now shooting, I have been getting about 125 pictures on the disk.  The USB cord will do an adequate job at uploading, but for much faster results, you will want the Compactflash card reader, especially when you have a lot of photos to upload.  One other thing that I would definitely note is that the camera can be expanded- rare in a beginning digital camera!  The telephoto zoom is impressive, but when digitally zoomed in after the picture is taken, the detail I have been getting is very impressive.  A virtual must-have is also the wide angle lens.  The landscapes and buildings I have been taking for work have made it extremely useful, and the attachment of any one of the three accessory lenses is easy, but does require an adapter, all of these sold separately.  I have gotten nothing but good comments on the pictures I have taken and shown to people thus far, and the camera itself convinced several friends to get the same model.  Because of the additional possibilities that the other lenses add, and for all of the features the camera has, I would definitely encourage you to look at one at a nearby store before you order if you are still not convinced- I am THRILLED with mine!","After 6 weeks the camera flash stopped working. Called support, & was instructed to mail it to them insured, and if I'm lucky I'll get it back before Christmas. Was looking forward to using camera for the Holiday season. On top of being inconvenienced, it will cost me (shipping & insurance) to get it fixed.<br />When it works, it's a great camera.","This camera has so many great features and is very easy to use. Here are my best features on why I bought over other Canon camera or Fujis (My experience: NIKON COOLPIX is best for camera buffs, but this one beats all for everyday shooting, travel shooting, family photos, and professinal looking shots within budget - (...)<br />(...)1. Largest resolution and largest size gives best 4x6 and 5x7 prints. I take all my photos on the CompactFlash card to Wolf Camera and they print them on their big machine. go professional for $.50 a photo - worth it everytime<br />2. Can take one pix in color, the next in B&W<br />3. Can use manual mode for faster shutter speed and/or aperature setting. Or can use AUTO like I do everytime<br />4. Flash red-eye works most of the time, but I do correct 2 out of 5 red-eyes b4 I take my pix to Wolf Camera with Adobe<br />5. Software for PC and cable lets you attach cable to camera and turn it on with automatic download to your PC of new pictures. You can also go in and download older ones saved on the media card (CompactFlash)<br />6. I like taking 5-7 pictures for one BEST shot. I then go through and delete the ones that did not come out well and print the one that did!<br />7. Video capture is about 15 seconds with high resolution and plays well on the PC. Each file can be joined with Microsft Movie Player (XP) to create one long movie (AVI file) nd burned to a CD. You can view the movie on the camera too.<br />8. Good depth of field. Not a wide angle, but some elements are achieved<br />9. Viewing screen on the back is very good and wide<br />10. Upgrade to a 64 MB or 128 MB card - the 8 MB included card is not enough for big photos<br />11.  Zoom is excellent. On highest zoon, you can't be too close or too dark. The focus will not work evertime, but taking a step back works.<br />12. Flash can be turned off for any shot<br />13. you can review the pictures on the camera one by one or by a small grid (I think like 9 pictures). You can even zoom in on the pix you took on the camera and move it around.","I did a lot of research on digital cameras before making this purchase.  Canon is a name that I trust and they haven't let me down here.  This camera is very user friendly and the pictures turn out fantastic.  The price is very resonable.  I use it almost every day.","When I purchased this camera as my entry into the digital world, I wanted to get a camera that would serve two purposes in one. I wanted something easy enough to use that the technology of the thing was not overwhelming to a first time user and I wanted something that had enough in the way of features so that I would not feel as though I needed to get a bigger and better model in 6 months. I really feel that the Canon A-40 neatly fulfills those two needs.<br />You can definitely get wrapped around the axle with all the cameras on the market these days. The feature list seems to be endless. In order to choose a camera that was right for me, I broke it down into the things that were important to me.<br />2 Megapixel camera - That number really translates into photo quality. With this camera you will be able to take and print JPEG images up to an 8x10 size with amazing clarity and detail. I thought at first that I should go for the maximum Megapixel rating possible but I have no need for prints of any larger size (besides my printer will not print anything larger.). I am quite pleased with the images that the camera produces with perhaps only a couple of exceptions but really nothing that deals with the resolution of the photos.<br />3X Optical Zoom and 4X Digital Zoom - For those of you who are familiar with a 35mm film camera the 3X Optical Zoom is the equivalent of 35mm-105mm zoom lens. One small complaint is that the zoom control is touchy and it can be difficult to adjust it into the proper range. With a bit of practice this can be overcome. The 4X optical zoom is selectable and works quiet well but there is a trade off (isn't all of life?). Using the digital zoom results in a loss of resolution with the image. For images that you send via e-mail this doesn't really represent a problem, but for those images that are to be printed it can become a factor.<br />1.5 inch LCD display and optic viewfinder - The optic viewfinder is a bit dinky and only shows about 80% of the actual recorded image. I have to confess I don't really use this feature preferring the LCD screen more. The LCD display on the other hand is another trade off. Although you get a bright color display of the image you are going to record, the screen tends to use battery power at an alarming rate. I was able to take over 100 photos with the regular alkaline batteries that were provided with the camera and didn't really see this as a serious problem. As a side note, I did purchase NIMH (nickel metal hydride) rechargeable batteries to use with the camera and have no complaints in this area.<br />Compact Flash memory system - This is a great memory system in my opinion. It is small and relatively easy to use. The camera comes equipped with an 8MB-memory card. At the highest resolution this card will hold about 8 photos which I will admit is not many. I quickly relegated the 8-MB card to a reserve role and now use a 128-MB card. It is a bit intoxicating knowing I can take about 200 high quality images and not have to have them developed in the traditional sense. You can preview each image and delete the ones that you don't want or keep them all. The camera has a USB port for direct downloading to your computer or you can opt for a card reader, which does not require the camera.<br />Beyond these basic features the camera will take pictures in a fully automatic mode (including flash) or will allow the uses to operate the camera in manual for a multitude of effects. I find that the auto settings work very well for the most part. My only complaint would be that from time to time the camera will flash when it probably shouldn't have and wash the photo out because of overexposure. This really isn't much of a problem in my opinion for two reasons. I didn't have to pay to have the photo developed to see the problem and it doesn't happen all that often.<br />You can do some incredible things such as \"stitching\" photo after adjacent photo creating a 360-degree panoramic photo of your surroundings or recording short AVI format movies.<br />Weighing in at 8.8 oz with the following dimensions - Depth 1.5 in, Height 2.8, in Width 4.3 in, This is not the most compact camera on the market so if your looking for the smallest model available you need to probably look elsewhere. I like it size though. It is just big enough to feel sturdy and durable but small enough to carry most places.<br />I find that the camera controls are conveniently placed and are very user friendly. Most are menu driven with the LCD display providing necessary guidance to use the features.<br />There are a wealth of accessories for this camera including replaceable lenses and a waterproof (to 200 feet) housing I haven't had the opportunity to use these items yet but when and if I do I will update this review.<br />Overall I would have to say that I am very pleased with this camera and that I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.","I wanted to purch. a camera that will take great pictures without spending a lot of money.  I was hesitant at first since it was a 2mp camera vs. 5mp.  After seeing the great pictures that it took (on medium resolution, superfine), I was quite impressed.  Although I was told that 4x6s will turn out fine, I was able to print out a really nice 5x7 that didn't look grainy.  In fact, I received a lot of compliments regarding how sharp the picture turned out (using auto mode).  I haven't used my Canon Rebel 2000 camera since I purchased this in Sept 2002.  This is a great camera to take along with you anywhere, especially if you have kids and you want to capture the special moments without having to worry about wasting film.  I also like the size and the feel of the camera (it has a nice grip).  I purchased a 128 CF card (you can take 128 pics on large resol., about 280 pics on medium). I also liked using the movie mode.  It came in handy when our baby took her first steps (and we didn't have the camcorder around).","I wanted to purch. a camera that will take great pictures without spending a lot of money.

I was very unsure about changing to digital from APS; in fact it took me a year to finally decide to buy a digital.  This camera was what finally tempted me and I have not been disappointed; it was great value (even better now), offers heaps of features, takes great photos, feels nice and the batteries last for ages.  So far I have taken at least 500 pictures and have only used 2 sets of batteries, I don't know of any other camera that has such good battery life.  The camera is also a great size, it is big enough to feel like a real camera and small enough to fit in a handbag.  And for all of you who think 2 megapixel isn't big enough, don't be fooled, I printed a 5x7 image today (and could have easily gone larger) and it looked just as good as an APS/35mm enlargment.  For those of you who don't want to waste your time by going to the photo lab and waiting for an hour or so to get your pictures printed, you can buy the cannon photo printer, which prints just like the photo labs! All in all the camera is SUPERB!","This thing is sweeeet!!<br />For the price you can't beat the Canon A40. Sure it's a 2MP camera but holy smokes folks! Look at what you get..<br />Tons of manual features such as f-stop tweaking and 3X optical zoom, sepia, B&W, AE/AF, 1.5\" Sony display, program and full auto modes as well. It has great looks, positive feedback and total functionality. It performs and looks like a real down to business camera...not like those other chic lookin' wannabe, thin style digital cameras out there.<br />I have looked at all the ~2.0 megapixel cameras available for the past year. I decided to buy Canon as the leader in digital photography. Prices recently dropped for the A40. I told myself one year ago that I would buy a digital camera when the 2MP's hit three hundred dollars. After all the haggling with the sales person for additional accessories was over, I ran out of the [store's] doors. Also picked up a SanDisk 128MB CompactFlash card at [local store]. I am going to invest in a premium leather case soon and will probably look at waterproof hard cases to protect my investment. When 4MP cameras with the same features drop to under three hundred dollars. in the future then I will make my next Canon purchase. I believe from reading other peoples testimonies that this camera is definitely worth your hard earned cash...<br />It's a Canon!","I purchased a Cannon Powershot A40 digital camera about a month ago. I have taken it with me traveling on California Highway 1. It is quite a good camera with excellent resolution and sharpness. The color of the picture matches closely with real life object. The only problem is the low light condition. I understand this is a common problem among digital cameras. And this is my first digital camera, so I don't know how it compares with other camera of its class. But for this particular camera, it has problem focusing in a medium sized room lit with a 60W light bulb. However, give it enough light, it will produce picture with excellent detail and color.","I wanted to buy a digital camera that have both the cool factors and good usability for the budget I had in mind.<br />When I found I couldn't find one satisfying both criteria. I chose the latter - picture quality and camera control features necessary for making good pictures.<br />A40 became the strongest option after some due deligence research.<br />But the following is annoying to me<br />- View finder only sees 80% of the actual picture to be taken, top 20% missing.<br />- Slow auto focus and does not always work<br />- Pics at ISO 400 are way too noisy - always use ISO 50, 100.<br />- Lowsy JPEG compression engine. Use Super Fine mode only.<br />- A little overexposure sometimes, use -1/3 adjustment.","I work for a weekly newspaper, and purchased this as my second digital camera back in April 2002.  Some 4600+ shots later in all sorts of conditions from the mountains to a cruise vacation, I can say this was an excellent investment!<br />The Pros:  Excellent battery life, a variety of features including the ability to make panoramic pictures (with included software) and take short 30 second films.  Good crisp photos- and a very good digital zoom (digital zooms do not usually work very well). Good wide angle lens for close-ups.<br />The Cons: Not very good in low-light situations (inside tents in the evening, photos of people at dawn or dusk)  Does all right for rapid-action (sports) photos, but film is still superior for that sort of action, and sunrises and sunsets.  Sometimes the \"ON\" button needs to be pressed twice (or just hard) to turn it on.<br />Overall, for my purposes, it is an excellent all-purpose camera, and is currently at the top of the office's list for a \"replacement\" camera if one of our other cameras fail.  The media (Compactflash) is very trouble free- we use card readers hooked up to the computer by the way, rather than hooking the camera itself up to the computer.","I bought this camera back in the summer and unfortunately had it stolen. Having used it for several weeks, I had a good grasp on its functions and debated upgrading to a different camera when I went to buy again.<br />Well I did my research and found that this camera really can't be beat. So I bought another one to replace the stolen one.<br />First of all, it's pretty much the only one on the market that gives you nine different options for manual control. If you're an experienced photographer who enjoys manually changing lighting and apeture settings like a SLR camera, this might be the camera for you, in the price range. You can change the f-stops/apeture along with film speeds to get the right camera lighting for specialized shots. You can also shoot in sepia tone, different lighting situations from florescent light to natural outside light. And you know how you can be walking along and see a shot that is perfect for black and white? This camera will let you do that; switch over from color mode to black and white, then press a button. It's that easy. No need to take your color photos back, upload them and fiddle around with them with a software program.<br />Of course it also has automatic functions for those not so proficient in shooting. The photos come out flawlessly in any lighting environment and has a red-eye flash reduction button for up-close portrait shots. In fact it has about four different flash settings from portrait shots, to delayed to timed to none, to red-eye. The resolution of the images is startling clear, the ability to see what you've taken immediately afterwards is a big plus. And you can adjust the time delay on image storage so that you can view it for up to 10 seconds after you've taken the picture and either keep it or immediately delete it, if it's not what you want; saving space on your memory card.<br />I bought a 64 meg memory card with this camera and at a high  resolution that allows about 68 photos; about 110 with medium resolution (still very high quality).<br />The camera itself is very intuitive; you'll have no problem figuring it out and shooting almost out of the box. If you have questions, the manual that comes with it pretty much explains everything you'd need to know. And Canon is known for its lens quality, so you know you're getting a good product that will carry you through any photo taking adventure.<br />The only negative I'd say is that it's a little bulky compared to other products out there. But the heft of it is not necessarily a bad thing ... if it were lighter or smaller you'd worry about breakage, or the solidity of the mechanisms.<br />I know there are 4.0 cameras out there now; but not with the multiple choice of function that this camera has. It has it all. And the image quality of each shot you take with this camera are startling clear, 2.0 is definately sharp, you'll probably be amazed at how clear the photos are compared to the regular 35 mm photos you've taken with your regular camera in the past.<br />As a novice photographer it's a great camera to learn and grow with because of all its technical abilities. For an advanced photographer, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at all its functions; enough to give you the perfect picture you're seeking.<br />And you can't beat the price. It's a great deal. Shop around, do your research; but make sure that the camera you choose has manual functions as you grow with your photo taking; is within a reasonable price; has the functions you need to take any shot from sports to family gatherings to landscapes; and gives you movie making ability (it has a built-in mic).<br />I know you'll return, again and again to this camera as your final choice. I did. Twice.","I knew absolutely nothing about digital cameras before my daughter's husband steered me to this one. My daughter and son had given me a gift certificate and told me they thought I'd like to have a camera, and they were right. Also the son was about to get married and wanted me to take some pictures of the festivities (or he figured it would keep me busy and keep me out of mischief).<br />In my first outing, shooting wild flowers in Colorado, I got absolutely gorgeous pics and was sold. The wedding pictures, taken a couple of weeks later, were sensational, or so I was told.<br />My only quibble, initially, with the camera - and hence the rating of four stars - was that the menu in the LED screen is a little difficult to navigate at first, although one learns and it becomes more or less automatic after that.<br />And the price isn't bad, either.","I'd been borrowing digital cameras up to now, and had learned a few things about what I liked and didn't like.  When my wife convinced me to take the plunge and buy one for myself, I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted.  Little did I know that I could get everything I wanted and more at such a reasonable price.<br />I researched the digital cameras in my price range, and quickly found that the Canon A40 offers more features than any other camera in its class.  I especially like the fact that I can take a quick picture in the auto mode, but still have the opportunity to experiment with the manual settings.  There is also a nice range of special effects, such as black and white and sepia that allow for some addtional creativity.  Most people would probably dismiss the movie mode as a gimmick, but it is a lot of fun to play with.<br />Keep in mind that you'll probably want a larger flash card and some rechargeable batteries.  Since the A40 uses the widely available CompactFlash and AA batteries, I was able to get a 128 MB card, two sets of batteries, and a good charger for less than [$$$]<br />I'm very glad I bought the A40,...","This camera is great!...<br />Everything about is great. There are a ton of features like movie, red eye reduction and direct to television. (About the television, you won't get as high a quality as you would on the computer. You can turn off the LCD and use the viewfinder. Also 3 optical zoom may seem small, but it is really good. You don't need to get a Sony Mavica 10 Optical if you are going to use it to take pictures of you kids doing sports unless you are on the other side of the football field or in an ice rink. The camera is very self-explanatory except for the rapid-fire mode, but the manual will tell you how to use it. (I have hardly have had to use it.) Make sure if you use Windows to set your settings for you desktop to make the icons smaller. Also if you are planning to get a Canon Direct printer, forget it unless you plan to frame most of your pictures. One more thing, the Compact Flash cards and batteries. The Compact flash cards are very nice, you don't need a 128 card unless your going away for like 2 weeks, a 64 meg one will still give you hundreds of pictures and they are a lot cheaper. Also the batteries, they run really long, even the non-rechargeable, you still want to get the rechargeable though. I suggest that you get a rapid charger and 8 batteries at Radio Shack.<br />This is a wonderful camera. I'd definitely buy this over a Sony Cybershot or an Olympus D-520. Both of those don't have sound on the movie and it may seem like you don't care now, but it does matter. Also the Olympus D-520 looks like the flash will break of and the Smart Media cards are as thin as 3 sheets as paper and look like they will snap in half.","The Canon A40 is a good digital camera for a great value.  Its 3x optical zoom is a real plus for a camera in its price range.  It is light and convenient to carry.  It maintains the same easy to use controls as most of Canon's line of Cameras.  The fact that it takes AA batteries is very convenient for traveling (you don't have to charge a battery every night and you don't have to wander around to find special batteries).  Its 2MP resolution is good for those looking for good snap shots or even an occasional 5X7 print.  It interfaces very easily with my computer and took very little time to set up.<br />The first drawback is the too-small-to-be-useful 8MB compact flash memory card.  You have to go out and buy a larger card (64 or larger would be preferable).  The second drawback is the color saturation with indoor photos.  Photos taken indoors with the built in flash sometimes need to be adjusted on the computer with the provided software in order to get a more natural color.<br />Despite the two minor inconveniences mentioned above, this is a good camera.  It offers a great value in its price range and the problems it has are only worse in many other models and brands in this price range.","Great for all basic shooting, travels, etc. Better picture quality than smaller cameras.","I've got a friend with a $2500 digital SLR who is jealous of what I paid for this camera with all the features it offers.  Now certainly there are a lot of things an SLR can do better, but for the value conscious amateur photographer, this is the camera for you!  I recommend purchasing a 128meg card and rechargeable NiMh batteries.  For manual mode or panorama shooting always use a tripod.  To save battery life, turn off the display screen-it will come on for 2-10 seconds after you take your shot.","This is a great sturdy camera.  The pictures come out great and professional looking.  The things that I took pictures of actually looked better in the picture than they did in actuality.  The canon A40 is very easy to use and does not feel flimsy and cheap like other cameras.  The battery life is good but you should get rechargeable batteries because you'll be addicted to this camera.  I use this camera more than my canon aps camera.  The flash is literally blindingly good, just don't take too many pictures of yourself all at once.  I got it for a good price and you will too if you shop around.  I love this camera.  You should get one too if you want something very dependable.","After carefully reading through literally hundreds of reviews on the 2 megapixel digital cameras with optical zoom out there at this time, and a visit to two stores to play with them in person, I decided on the Canon Powershot A40.<br />This is why: the camera body is sturdy and it is easy to hold and shoot. It looks like a normal camera so fits in most point-and-shoot camera bags. The camera is also small enough to fit in the pocket of most cargo pants. It has many accessories available and has upgradable lenses.<br />The camera is somewhat intuitive to use once you know what the symbols for the buttons indicate- all of them are multifunctional. The only downsides are that the knob is a little less than ergonomic and the manual is horribly organized.<br />The camera itself is fantastic overall. It does eat batteries quickly when connected to the computer for downloading, but on the road it is very conservative (I reccommend buying the ac adapter for downloading unless you have an unlimited supply of batteries). The optical zoom flows smoothly into the digital. The software is very easy to use and you will definitely find it useful. It also comes with a lite version of Adobe- which is a great piece of software to have on it's own.<br />What about the pictures? The pictures are fantastic! The shots are much more akin to a manual 35 mm camera than a point-and-shoot. The colors are very vivid. You'd never be able to take shots like this with a regular camera. It can take a picture in a darkened room and make it as clear as if the lights were on.<br />All together this is a great camera and I'm glad I bought it! I highly reccommend you consider it too!<br />(Aside, Amazon.com has better prices than ALL the retail stores, it's trustworthy and just as good as most internet stores/auctions so I suggest you buy it here.)","I bought this camera after looking around for awhile ... I chose the Canon A40 from Amazon because of the options you get a t this price is great.  I have an 11 month old who is getting ready to walk and this camera will record a video file.  That is good because I don't always have the camcorder handy.  My 3 year old likes to look at the pictures right after I take them. ...","I have read several reviews and I personally tried the Canon A40, Pentax 230 and Sony P71 in the past 6 weeks. I took multiple pictures with each camera and compared the output on screen and in print side by side. I finally decided the A40 by Canon was the keeper.<br /> It wasn't perfect because it was bigger and heavier. Also, the menus could be better and a 4 way navigation button would have been nice. The A40 did have the best battery life of the 3 and seemed to have the best track record for most pictures in focus. The major selling point was the picture quality. The A40 provided the best exposures, most accurate colors, and prints that were the most pleasing to the eye. I figure the pictures are why you buy a camera not size and weight.<br />When I took pictures of the same sceen with all 3 cameras, printed them up and showed them to my friends, they universally picked the shots take with the Canon as the best.<br />It is the best value for the money IMHO.","This camera has an excellent picture quality at an affordable price.<br />The provided 8MB Compact flash card is not enough at all especially with high resolution photos, so i recommend buying at least, extra 64MB.<br />The only trouble i have is while focusing with very low light conditions: the AutoFocus has problems on those conditions, but Canon worked on that and posted a patch at the web  site.<br />Despite this small detail, the camera is a perfect choice for a starter (and not so starter!)","i have had this camera for 3 months now. I took this camera to 2 trips and boy It *was* fun. I have taken over 4k shots with it, done all kind of shots, outdoor, indoor, day and night shoot, scenary, paranorma(stitch!), stationary / moving , special effect........ But most of my picture(1600x1200) are kind of burr when view @1600x1200. Disappointed quality compared to my friends canon S200, also a 2M pixel camera.<br />At first I feel the A40 is very easy to use(of course, there is a learning curve involved.). The various settings on the camera are easy to set without going thru alot of menu(cf. olyumpus camera).<br />The color is Excellent but a bit over saturated. I found the color is closer to the original subject if u have the 'photoeffect' set to 'neutral'. Under very favourable/strong lighting condition, the picture quality is excellent. But the subject cannot be very far away(within  a couple of feet.) or it will burr. And I have found out most of my distant shot(landscape shot with landscape mode set on A40) are kind of burr too. Sometimes, some flower marco shots(again u need to set marco mode on the camera) are out of focus. It is extremely difficult to obtain correct focus on marco/close up shots. its like a hit and miss thing. It also wont focus on RED flower. I dont know if its the Autofocus system malfunction or some other issues. I have already applied the official canon AF adjustment upgrade(BTW its not a firmware upgrade!) but cannot notice any improvement. Since I couldnt confirm the 13.6 Focal length problem as mentioned by smokingbear before the update. But I tend to agree to smokingbear that maybe the update is just a 'patch' to the F/L info and not a 'fix' to the actual focus problem.<br />In low light condition u definitly need to use flash to get sharp picture. And this camera will not focus in low light even u have the Canon AF-assist light turned on. And the redeye reduction flash is a joke. u will *most* likely  to get redeye if u turned it on.<br />I like the manual function of this camera. There is alot of (read *alot*)  settings on the manual shutter control(from 15s to 1/1500). on the other hand, the manual aperture setting has much less to choose from.<br />Another feature i like is the ability to turn off sharpening. It can be done later using photoshop, so there is no need to use the onboard sharpening for each photo.<br />The battery life is excellent I have my lcd display on all the time. Talking about LCD, U do need a bigger monitor to check if your picture is out of focus or not.<br />Almost all review on this camera never discuss the Auto focus issue which i find interesting. seems nobody mention canon is notorious about their AF system. If this camera had the ability to produce focus and sharp 1600x1200 picture all the time,  I will certainly vote A40 to be the best digital camera to own right now. But this camera can produce maybe just 50% good quality 1600x1200 stuff ...","I did a lot of research before I bought a digital camera, and the Canon A40 came out as the best by far in the $200 - $400 price range.<br />The 2 MPixel system gives nice computer jpegs and nice prints. The 4\"x6\" prints that I've made at our local Walmart look great and the colors are perfect, like professionally developed 35 mm prints. I could not tell at all that they were \"digital\". They were certainly nicer than 35mm prints developed at most \"24 hour\" shops, and cheaper as well. As an aside, I tried some 1-1.3 MPixel cameras and found that in most cases I could detect their \"blockiness\" in prints and in jpegs viewed on a computer monitor. Remember that you often need to crop and then blow up pictures for web pages and the like, and the 1 Mpixel cameras will give you problems here. 2 MPixel seems to take you just above the \"blockiness\" threshold for most jpegs unless you really have to blow them up a lot.<br />The Canon A40 itself has many excellent features, and after taking well over a thousand shots I've not had any serious problems. I've even found that you can do things like taking a picture through a telescope, binoculars or a magnifying glass. You need a tripod and it can be tricky, but you can do it. I especially like the long time exposures you can do, and the macro mode for closeups.<br />The software that came with the camera works just fine on my windows 2000 machine, and downloading and viewing is a breeze using the USB port. It would be helpful to have some basic photo editing software, like adobe photoshop lite or macromedia fireworks. Get two sets of NiMH batteries (one in the camera and one charged and handy for when replacement is needed). I picked up an Everyready NiMH charger and 8 NiMH batteries at (local store) for something like $30. A charged set will last for many hundreds of shots depending on how often you use the flash. I also recommend getting at least a 128 MB flash card as you'll be surprised how many pictures you take once you get one of these cameras. I found the perfect case at (local store) for about $10.<br />The three best things about digital cameras are:<br />1) You know exactly what you have when you shoot a photo<br />2) You can take as many photos as you like until you get that perfect one, and then just delete the bad ones<br />3) The fidelity is basically perfect unless you blow up prints to a large size. You don't have any devloping flaws to contend with, and once you have it in digital format, it will never deteriorate. Someone looking at these photos one hundred years from now will see them as you do now (though no doubt they'll have more advanced technology by then).","To sum up: This is a great camera for its price, and more.<br />Overall: I got this gem in June and felt tempted to join the raves right away, but then I decided to wait for the impending trip across Argentina. I used it from the Andes to Iguazú, in cloudy, rainy, sunny weather; in freezing cold and on hot days; in the desert-like mountains and in the spray of the Iguazú Falls.<br />This is one rugged camera which offers great features, especially if you are used to Canon products: I had the A-1 and still use the EOS 500N and found it supremely easy to get into the groove of this camera, in fact, this very reason won me over compared to the Sony P-50 and the Olympus D-510. I won't bother you with repeating the features, you can look them up any day on the Canon website. Remember though, the video capability is nice, but you can't turn the videos 90° - I have to watch my Iguazú sweep with my head on my shoulders... And the artistic options like B/W or Sepia (the 1900s style) are definitely cute.<br />Also, other than many guys on this site, I consider myself a dedicated amateur and DO use all the extras and gimmicks of this camera.<br />Battery: As is common knowledge, plain batteries won't do it. I got the Amazon Kodak set plus the Olympus charger and batteries, and there is no problem even though theoretically you are supposed to use 1600 mAh only: these have 1700 and 1850 mAh respectively (and I'm charging the 1850 Kodaks in the 1700 Olympus charger); no sweat. The new rechargeables lasted me a day of heavy picture-taking, but they seem to last longer with time. If you use it now and then, we are talking weeks and months, it might even be smarter to use standard batteries.<br />Lens: Just great, the optical zoom equals SLR 38-105mm, which gives you many options. Forget about the digital zoom, you can do that with software on your PC.<br />Memory card: Obviously, the 8 MB card that comes with it is a pathetic joke, but hey, do you expect your SLR camera to come with a stash of films? For a holiday, I'd recommend two cards of 128 MBs each, this gives you about 270 pix at highest size/resolution. Remember that opposed to a conventional camera, you can sit down every night with a beer/wine/cocktail/mineral water (delete as appropriate) and delete the failed shots, so you'll need a lot less takes compared to 35mm films.<br />Card reader: Frankly, if you're not a professional photographer or terminally ill, why bother with one? I downloaded a 128 MB card in about 10 minutes, which means 135 perfect pix or about 4 secs each, or more at lower quality. Win XP seems to be even faster. And how often do you need to download that amount?<br />Exposure: Here's the downside - if it can be considered such at this price. The camera will always lighten up the dark spots in your picture as opposed to a SLR which will find a compromise. This resulted under hazy conditions in plain white skies. Then again, you can fix this with the exposure meter by changing it to -1 or less.<br />If you want to see examples, check out the pix at Webshots (User: chileno66, not all are with this camera!).<br />If in doubt, don't hesitate: This is one great camera in its range!","I LIKE THE SIMPLICITY OF THE CAMERA. MY WIFE CAN EVEN USE IT. THE PROGRAM THAT COMES WITH IT ON THE CD DOES NOT HAVE AN ENHANCING SET-UP. MY PICTURES DO NOT COME OUT AS SHARP AS MY WIFE'S REGULAR CAMERA. THEY ARE \"ALL RIGHT\" BUT SLIGHTLY BLURRY.I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SHARPEN THE PICTURE","For the $$$, can't be beat!!!!  I've shot 2000+ pictures with my A40 of Alaska, Sunsets, Moonshots, Flowers, GOM Offshore Steel, Workshop, etc. and hadn't had one problem with this camera! As they say, seeing is believing. If you have any doubts about A40's abilities, take a look at Webshots \"torretab\". The 1600 X 1200 resolution pics (98%) are taken with the Canon A40.  Colors are natural, resolution is as good as it gets with a 2 meg camera and images have a look of quality 35mm film work! It is loaded with usable features that work well and provide a lot of flexibility in the digicam realm.<br />I've been looking to step up to a 4 meg pixel camera, but other than for printing larger than 8 x 10's, the A40 does an admirable job for everything I've asked it to do!!<br />Unless you want to spend a lot more money, the A40 may fill the task for you to!","This is one of the best camera's in its class.<br />At first I was surprised why Canon had such a small LCD display (1.5') until I realized that it had over 1 Million pixels (far greater than most camera's in the market today).<br />Slightly on the heavier side but with very good feel/grip.<br />Uses standard or rechargeable AA batteries instead of proprietary batteries that the other Canon camera's use. The life of Alkaline & NiMH batteries is really good. I would have preferred if Canon supplied NiMH batteries and a charger besides adapting the camera to use 2 batteries instead of 4.<br />The software is OK but if Canon could provide the driver software that makes the camera appear like a HardDrive, it would make the process of uploading pictures thru the USB interface easier as Windows usually ships with these drivers.<br />It is not the best camera I would say but then I couldnt find another camera better in its class.","I don't usually write reviews, but I am so impressed with this camera that I had to write a short one.<br />Things I like about this camera:<br />- can turn off in-camera sharpening. Most digicams oversharpen pictures, making them look unnatural.  The images coming out of this camera with sharpening set to low (basically off) are very 35mm-like.<br />- manual controls.  Even though you only set the f-stop at two points--wide open (2.8 - 4.0) or fairly small (8.0 - 14.0) depending on the focal length--my photographic \"powess\" hasn't been restrained by this limitation yet.<br />- noise reduction for exposures over 1.3 seconds (using dark frame subtraction) that works wonderfully;<br />- ergonomic, if not easy to learn (I didn't mind reading the manual).  Most functions are accessible without going into the menus;<br />- continuous shooting mode that could satisfy Austin Powers: fast (1.2/large - 1.5/small fps) and lets you shoot between 7 (large) and 63 (small) frames before \"..and I'm spent\";<br />- last, but not least, great pictures overall: little CCD noise and minimal blooming -- two more things making the pictures look more like film.<br />Things I don't like about this camera:<br />- Uh.. hmmm... Actually the only thing I didn't like is that the lens' barrel distortion at wide angle is tad strong. And that is getting very, very picky.<br />All in all, the best value in a digicam for under five hundred bucks.","Works great.  Printed pictures are as good or better than 35mm lab prints.  I'm using it with an Epson 820 and am delighted with the combo.  8.5x11 prints look great.  The camera in auto mode gets almost all exposure and focus situations correct, very accurate auto.  Full manual features are there but I haven't used them much, what I have played with works very well.  The zoom is sufficeint for most point and shoot situations.  Very good red eye controls are in this camera, the best I've ever seen.  The 4AA batteries are a nice feature.  I use 1700NiMH batteries and get more than 200 photos with hours of lcd display time.  My wife loves the slide show on TV feature for sharing photos with family and friends.  This camera is a real solid performer, we're very pleased with it.","This is my first digital and after reading the reviews I am pleased to say that I am happy with this model.  I've taken it on backpack trips and have taken lovely pictures...  You will need a larger memory card than what comes with it.  The manual is easy to read; although parts of it I had to study.  A glossary would have been a nice addition to the user guide.  It comes with a Spanish edition which I will gladly exchange for another English addition; just contact me so we can exhange addresses.  To save battery juice you can shut off the LCD display and take about 100 shots before replacing the batteries; a battery charger is a must!  To upload a card reader is nice because it uses your computer juice to upload and not the camera's batteries.  Overall, I am satisfied with the camera","Almost everything I've read about this camera (the good and the bad) is true.  However, in my opinion, most of the bad things are either good to me, or just a problem with digital cameras in general.<br />The good -<br />Solidly built (I like a little weight to my camera)<br />Great night shots (if set properly you can even take pics of the stars)<br />Great manual controls (if you want to use them)<br />3x Optical Zoom (don't even bother with the digital)<br />Nice movie mode (w/sound)<br />Good automatic focus (95% of the time)<br />Just great looking pictures.<br />The bad (or at least what some say is bad) -<br />Big and a bit heavy (a plus to me)<br />Extensive documentation (a plus to me)<br />Only 8 mb CF storage (Buy at least 128 mb)<br />Comes with 4 AA batteries (Buy rechargeable)<br />Occasionally has  some trouble auto focusing inside (but not too often and the pics still look good)<br />I have used or owned cameras by Olympus, Kodak and Sony and would rate this camera as good as any Sony (in the price range) and better than any Olympus or Kodak<br />Overall I am extremely happy with this camera and would recommend to anyone.","this is my first digital camera & i truly love it.  it's easy to use & takes terrific photos (in the high resolution mode).  the mini movie making function is a fun bonus,too.","PROS:<br />The Cannon A40 is definately a good quality digital camera at a good price. Compatible with the latest PC Windows versions (except for Windows Professional 2000) although  specifically designed for Windows XP which is good since almost ever PC sold in retail stores today comes with Windows XP. Very easy to install in your computer. The software runs itself. Very easy to take excellent quality pictures. Photos look great even when printing on standard paper with a standard Inkjet printer. Large variety of photo functions. Automatic focus. Good automatic lighting capabilities with various flash options for taking excellent pictures at night. Colors and subjects are rich and clear. Pictures don't look animated. Short movie capabilities. Red-eye removal. Self timer. 3x Zoom option. A very durable and attractive camera. Good quality brand name.<br />CONS:<br />Weighs a little more and not as compact as similar cameras with the same capabilities. Software provided doesn't allow for many adjustment options to pictures taken when transferred to PC. Instruction booklet is long and a little intimidating. Camera itself only comes with a 8MB Compact Flash Card(about 8 photos). Need to buy another Card with a larger memory. Batteries drain quickly (which is true with almost every digital camera). Doesn't come with carrying case. Menus on LCD screen are not very user friendly while controls on the back of the camera are a little too busy and intimidating. Not a camera for people who don't like to read instructions.","A great camera with lots of features found only on more expensive models.  It's great for beginners...the AUTO mode is simple to use and takes very good quality pictures.  For more advanced users, there are a large number of user controlled features in Program and Manual mode.  Plenty of camera for everyone.  You won't be disapointed.  You will, however, want to upgrade to a larger CF memory card.","I've had it for about a week, and it is taking me that long to figure out how to use it!  I am totally satisfied with the camera's features and quality.  The one drawback that I see is the User Guide is not user-friendly for someone who doesn't understand the more complicated features.  It explains how to use them, but not what they are exactly, or why I would want to use those.  That is my one frustration with this.  Basic use of the camera is easy enough, and the quality of picture is great.  I'm happy with it... just need to learn!","I was a first-timer with digital cameras, but I bought this camera in May after reading many reviews on Amazon and other sites.  We love this camera and have already taken over 400 pictures!  The color quality of each is truly excellent (example:  I took it on a business trip and my pictures came out richer than my boss's professional grade digicam).  Even in dark areas the pictures come out clear, although the viewfinder may not show it that way.  The software that is included is confusing to install but easy to use.  I definitely recommend upgrading memory (128 mb) and buying rechargable batteries.<br />I'm bummed that the camera price only dropped now!!  It was such a great investment as it was, it is a steal at this lower price.","Having been an SLR camera buff for well over 25 yrs, it was tough for me to jump into the digital camera era.  After much research and reading many different reviews like this one, I bit the bullet and bought the Canon Powershot A40 sight unseen (well without having put my hands on one and trying one out!) I was going on a trip and needed something that I could share my pictures with everyone quickly. This camera really fit the bill! I have had so much fun playing with it and the best part of it is that you can delete the pictures that you don't want and only print the ones you do... What a change from printing all the pictures and then having ones that you don't want either hanging around or even throwing them away. I also like the 'mini movies' that you can make and everyone is totally amazed that this camera can do what it does!  I definitely would recommend this camera to even the novice. I also recommend that you invest in rechargeable batteries, I used up the ones that came with the camera the same day I got the camera!","This camera has more features than any digital camera... However, it seems ALL canon powershot A40 has an out of focus problem in zoom mode at focal length 13.4mm in auto focus mode. (The second to largest zoom setting). At this focal length the camera will set focus fixed at distance of 66m (roughly 200 feet) no matter how far your intended objects are. This often causes out of focus problems.<br />Canon admits this problem and it says their new firmware would solve this problem. However many customer mentioned the only thing the new firmware does is remove the \"distance\" information from the jpeg exif info. And that hides the fact that the camera is still focusing at a fixed 66m at 13.4mm focal length.<br />I don't know if the firmware fix is really aimed at hiding the problem only. Anyway I hope Canon will make this issue public and give some detailed explanation to clear things up.","...P>The Canon Powershot A40 is an excellent camera, especially for one at the entry-level digital camera price point ...  This is the second digital camera I've owned,...P>The A40 is everything I had hoped for in a digital camera: good picture quality, USB connection, and an intuitive interface.  The interface was especially good in contrast to the Olympus.  Settings for resolution and compression level are separate, which is a major feature to me.  The 3 available resolutions are 640x480, 1024x768, and 1600x1200.  The jpeg compression levels are normal, fine, and superfine.  Images at 1600x1200 and Superfine compression are quite nice indeed, with little, if any, jpeg artifacting.<br />Focusing is done through Canon's AiAF system, which (I guess) uses artificial intelligence to help focus the lens.  If you use the LCD screen when taking your pictures, 3 boxes appear representing the focus points.  When pressing the shutter half-way, the boxes turn green representing the part of the image that will have the focus.  This is very handy as it's hard to tell what the camera is focusing on sometimes.  However, this system does get annoying at times, such as when the green boxes choose to focus on something other than what you want!  This usually requires you to make an adjustment to your angle or position.  In general I am pretty pleased with the focusing on the A40.  ...I was afraid that I was simply expecting too much for a camera at this price point, but the Canon has shown me otherwise.<br />Pictures with the A40 are sharpest in bright sunlight, as you would probably expect.  Focusing is not quite as good in low light situations, but the AiAF is helpful in this regard.  If none of the green boxes appear when you press the shutter button it's a sign that there's not enough light to get a good focus, and your image may come out blurry.  There's an autofocus helper beam that's supposed to help the camera focus in low light, but it's so dim that I don't see how it can really be of any assistance.  Indoors, pictures taken with the flash are pretty good, but sometimes the flash goes off outside where there is ample light, and the resulting image is quite dim.  In these situations I've found it's usually best to disable the flash, though you might end up with a somewhat blurry image.<br />Colors on the A40 are bright and vivid.  There are sites you can find with great sample pictures, and I would suggest everyone find some sample photos before making a decision on any digital camera.  I don't notice much, if any, bleeding of colors,...The menu system is clean and intuitive.  The font for the menus is easy to read, even in bright sunlight.  There is an on/off button which in photo mode causes the lens to extend or retract, or in \"play\" mode causes the stored images to be displayed on the LCD screen.  There's a mode wheel which allows you to select Play, Auto, Program, Manual, Panorama, and Movie mode.  The movie mode allows you to record short (~15 seconds on the included 8 meg CF card) movies.  Most digital cameras sold today have this \"Feature,\" however the Canon is unique in that it has a built-in microphone, so you get sound with your movie as well as video.  Most cameras have no mic, so you're left with video only.<br />One thing that was somewhat disappointing with the A40 was that it wasn't recognized as a Mass Storage Device when plugged into my Windows 2000 PC, which my Olympus was.  However, this turned out to be a non-issue once I installed the A40's included software.  Once the software is installed, you plug the camera into a USB port on your PC, set the camera to \"play\" mode, and turn it on.  Canon's ZoomBrowser application then starts up, and prompts you to download all of the camera's new images (since the last time you synced, though you can set it to fetch all images, or just ones you've flagged) to your PC.  On the included 8 meg card this takes less than 30 seconds when the card is full.  Once the images have been transferred to my PC, I quit the ZoomBrowser app, so I can't really give you a decent review of the app itself.  I prefer to do photo editing in photoshop.<br />The A40 takes 4 AA batteries, which are included.  I've had the camera for over a week and taken ~200 pictures and am still using the set of batteries that came with the camera, so I would say it has pretty good battery life.  As with any digital camera, I would recommend a set of NiMH rechargables if you're planning to use the camera with any frequency (and believe me, since you're not worrying about paying for film processing, you'll be using the camera a lot more -- I take pictures of the wall just because I *can*).<br />As I've stated above, the A40 ships with an 8 MB Compact Flash card.  At the max resolution and best compression, this will hold only 8-12 images, so I plan on purchasing a 128 meg CF card.  ... and it will save you lots of time running back and forth to the PC to transfer images, especially if you use a lower resolution or jpeg level -- my personal favorite is 1024 Superfine.<br />All in all, the Canon Powershot A40 is an excellent camera for the price, is more than suitable for beginners, and is even enough to satisfy a computer-geek (but photo-newbie) like me.  While you can probably get better quality by spending more, the A40 is relatively inexpensive for such a quality device.","I've bought 1-2 megapixel digital cameras from Kodak, Olympus, Polaroid, and Fuji as well as the Canon A20 and A40.  The Canons are easily the best of the bunch in both image quality and product reliability.  That's why I now have the A40 as my primary camera and the earlier A20 model as my backup.  The others have been given away to less discriminating friends and family members.  When my office finally got around to buying a digital camera, it bought the A40 based on my recommendation and the quality of the photos I took while on vacations in Utah, Arizona, and Wyoming.  Despite heavy use and occasional drops, the Canons have never malfunctioned (unlike the Fuji 2600 I gave my daughter that has been repaired twice in nine months).  What a treat it is to have photos that look this good whether printed out in albums or used as PC screensavers.","I love this camera and can't imagine living without it. I upgraded from the A20 which I also loved. The A40 offers more power to adjust the camera settings than the A20, as well as adding a cool but modest movie mode. It exceeded my expectations.","even with the extra accessories you'll need (you definitely NEED a case, NiMH batteries & charger, & larger flash memory), this camera is a value.  it takes amazing pictures, can't fault them for a 2MP camera, and the manual options are fun even for an amateur to experiment with.  it's big flaw is its size: it is heavy (about 1 lb) with the batteries installed and too big to keep in a pocket.  thinking about going with the much more portable elphs.","I did extensive research, as most entering into the digi photography realm, and have found the 2mp, sub [price] digicam catagory is crowded with many very good cameras (Fuji 2600, Olympus D520, etc.). However, only one truely shines as an \"enthusiast's\" camera with all the features ... the Canon Powershot A40. It has everything - manual mode, movie mode with audio, burst mode (2.5 shots/second), output to TV, accessories (underwater housing, lenses, etc.), and on and on - but most importantly it takes stunning photographs! But one need not be a shutterbug to properly utilize the power of this camera -- as most of my (excellent) shots have been taken in full Auto mode. I just frame, shoot, and the camera returns a beautiful capture. I am passionate about all of my hobbies and \"toys\" (cars, motorcycles, boats, skiing, electronics, A/V equipment, interior design) and have a high threshold of acceptance for all of my purchases. The A40 does not fall short. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone without reservation!","You should all know that Canon makes the best 2X Megapixel cameras in [that price] range. Above that range - I would buy Nikon or Fuji.<br />I was looking at: Canon S330, S200, A40 - in that order. I went to [2 different camera stores] for all my information and learned a lot. I threw out the S200 because of the 2X zoom rather than the 3x optical zoom of the A40 and S330. I looked at the S330 and A40 and went with the A40 since it was [less expensive] and the features the S330 had over the A40 was not enough for me to spend [that much] more. Here are the differences:<br />* The S330 is the ELPH model and smaller than the A40. The A40 sits in your hand better with the curve. The S330 was easy to drop and not any lighter.<br />* The A40 uses AA batteries. The S330 uses rechargebale Lithium ion batteries. I use rechargeables AA already. The S330 also comes with a charger and the A40 does not.<br />* Both view screens are the same on the back - 1.5 inches. Both can use AUTO, Manual, Macro, Portrait, and Landscape.<br />* Both have the same flash functions - red eye, off, auto.<br />* Both cameras can shoot 30 second movies with AUDIO.<br />* The S330 has the ability to set personal settings, like when you turn it self-timer - you can record yourself saying\" Get Ready!\". The A40 does not.<br />* I don't think the A40 lets you record AUDIO per picture like the S330 does. For example, the S330 you can record your memories of the photo while you take it. Not on the A40.<br />* Both have same software - it's very good for downloading. It uses USB to the PC (I have XP) and auto downloads new photos. A snap to set up.<br />* Both have same resolution - Large, Med, Small. Same Compression - Normal, Fine, SuperFine.<br />* Both come with 8 MB card - not enough - get a 64MB.<br />* Both come with all cords<br />Good luck. For me the voice controls and smallness were not worth [the extra money]. The A40 works great. The pictures are very clear, sharp, and easy to load into the PC.","I've had my eye on getting a digital camera for quite a while, but I waited until now for the right combination features to get within my price range.  The Canon A40 was well worth the wait.  Within five minutes of opening the box, I was taking great pictures with this camera.  I wouldn't call the more complex features of the A40 intuitive, but with 3-4 hours of experimenting, I had figured out almost everything without opening the manual (although the manual is handy for picking up the details).<br />Installation of the software on my XP system was a breeze.  I still don't have everything figured out yet, but the basics were self-explanatory without the manual.<br />Along with the camera, I bought 2 sets of Maha 1800mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries and the Maha fast charger.  I guess I can't really say how well the batteries work because I haven't managed to run through the first charge yet! ;)  I also picked up the 128 MB SanDisk flash card.<br />The only real problem I have with the A40 is in getting the autofocus to lock correctly and consistently.  The problem is especially bad indoors, where I miss a lot of easy shots that my point-and-shoot Fuji 35mm could handle easily.  The camera is unable to get a focus lock on anything about 10% of the time.  When it does claim that it has a lock, about 5% of the time it was actually focusing on a spot about a foot below the squares in the LCD that are supposed to show what the autofocus is locked on.  The focus difficulties were almost enough for me to give the camera 4 stars, but when you consider this rare problem against the price, the features, and all of the fantastic pictures I've taken already, it's clear that this camera deserves the highest rating.<br />One thing that I would like to see on future generations of this camera is a 4-way thumb pad like the S330 has.  This would be useful when you're changing the settings, looking at thumbnails, or reviewing a picture in the viewfinder.<br />All in all, there's no camera in this price range that comes close to the A40.  The A40 is a fantastic camera with great features and gives anyone the ability to take sharp and clear digital pictures.","Finally got my first digital camera, and feel like I really scored with this one.  There are some 2MP cameras available for less money, but the features of this one make it really stand out:<br />* Extremely simple operation, but with the chance for manual control<br />* Convenient USB interface<br />* TV interface cable - my family was looking at full-screen pictures minutes after arriving home from a theme park (the camera can scroll through them automatically)<br />* Movie mode<br />* Auto-stitch mode to create seamless panoramics<br />And the image quality seems quite good.<br />I've been told these things eat batteries, so we got NiMH batteries and charger, and will carry some alkalines for backup.<br />My friend had recommended Canon's Elph to me for about the same price, but I like the more substantial, \"real-camera\" feel.<br />All in all, a very nice camera for a reasonable price.","I've been using this camera for two weeks and I am impressed. It is a good choice for those who has no experience in digital photography, or have some. Quality of the pictures is really good. However, you MUST get a larger memory card and rechargeable batteries. Otherwise, you'll feel frustrated.","All I can say is that this is an amazing camera.  It does everything you'd ever want to do and the picture quality is great.  I just did a panarama and it's so cool, it connects all the pictures together for you.  Very cool camera.  You should how ever buy some rechargeable batteries and a larger compactflash card.","It's my first Canon Digital camera purchase after owning olympus 1.1 Meg Pixel D340L.<br />A40 delivers fine quality images and just the design and handling of the camera makes it so comfortable to hold and take pictures.<br />It's so addictive that you just want to keep taking picture and fill up the 8MB card. So, I bought two seperate 64MB cards and they can take all the picutres I want.<br />I've used it for taking small video shots also in AVI format and the included AV cable comes handy. I could then convert my AVIs into MPEG and burn them onto VCD for viewing pleasure on TV along with the slide shows.<br />All in all, a great camera for the price and delivers good quality sharp pictures deom an impressive device.","I could tell you a bunch of details...but, I will make it simple, This camera is easy to use and takes Great pictures.  Like everyone says, get at least a 128mb Compact flash card and a good set of rechargeable batteries.  I did and I love this camera.  The pictures are great!  I don't think I can say that enough.  If you are looking at any other cameras...stop and buy this one.  You will love it.  Just like I do.  Happy shopping.","Color: great, accurate color when shooting outdoors and under the studio lighting. All in all though, the A40 produced unusually appealing color.<br />Exposure: The A40 did a great job with exposure, capturing great midtones both indoor and outside. A40's exposure system worked very well, but did show a tendency to lose highlight detail in very contrasty lighting conditions.<br />Sharpness: Image sharpness was good for a two-megapixel camera, with crisp details throughout the frame. Optical distortion was a bit better than average at the wide-angle lens setting.<br />Closeups: The A40 came in a bit below average in the macro category, capturing a rather large minimum area of 6.56 x 4.92 inches. Color, detail, and resolution were all great, however.<br />Night Shots: The A40 did unusually well for an entry-level camera in my low light shooting tests.  Some of the lower light level shots had slightly soft focus, but results were good overall. The camera's noise reduction system did a reasonably good job of eliminating image noise.<br />Battery Life: Battery life on the A40 is very good. In its worst-case power consumption mode (capture mode with the LCD screen turned on), it should run about 3 1/2 hours on a freshly-charged set of high-capacity NiMH AA batteries. With the LCD screen off, it can run for over 20 hours straight. Playback mode run time should be about 5-6 hours. This is really excellent, but you'd better purchase a couple of sets of rechargeable batteries still holds.<br />Conclusion:<br />The A40 is a nicely-designed, stylish, functional camera that take great pictures. The A40 has a nice sharp lens, and excellent color rendition. The Movie capture mode makes the A40 great for recording short clips of special events, while the Stitch-Assist mode lets you capture expansive panoramic shots. The 2.0-megapixel CCD produces good image quality, with enough detail to print images as large as 8x10 inches. If you're looking for a good entry-level camera with a range of options and excellent picture quality, you need look no further than the A40.<br />Pros:...Very good photo quality...<br />-Easy to use in point-and-shoot or manual modes<br />-Excellent software bundle<br />-Supports external lenses, underwater case<br />-Solid Construction<br />-High quality lens, Software, CCD add up to great pictures.<br />-Lots of manual controls over exposure, f-stop, ISO etc.<br />-Continous shooting at 3 frames/sec.<br />-Built-in lens cover, so there's no worries about lens caps<br />-Very good manual (177 pags)<br />Cons:<br />-No rechargeable batteries included<br />-Sometimes slow shutter speed<br />-No uncompressed file format (TIFF or RAW) only saves as JPEG<br />-Macro mode not up to rest of the camera features<br />-Drains regular Alkalines fairly fast<br />-8MB memory won't be enough","For the vast majority of digital camera users, this A40 will meet all of their needs well into the future. The Canons have a fine reputation for durability and if ever there is a problem, service has been excellent. The A40 in the entry model in a series of sturdy digicams that offer progressively higher resolutions, but little else in terms of functionality. As I have stated in numerous reviews of other digicams, resolution much beyond 2 megapixels is worse than useless for *most* applications, it is costly. It not only costs money in the sense that it raises the initial price of the camera, but operationally, it requires greater battery use, usually involves longer lag times between shots, takes much longer to download to a PC and especially prolongs both phases of e-mailing photos (your uploading the file and your recipient opening it). These latter issues are, in my opinion, the most important, as the real purpose of digital cameras is their neat integration into the world of personal computing.  [note: For those folks whose needs are enlarging photos beyond 8\" x 10\", higher resolution is required] The other features of the A40 worth noting are its very adequate 3X optical zoom (do not accept digital zooms in place of optical zooms; they are not equals), its ability to operate off readily available AA alkalines (though it will accept rechargeables and these make more sense in may ways), its easily expandable memory and its rather surprising number of user-controllable settings, all of which can be handled automatically if you prefer. Lastly, the current price is half what it would have been 18 months ago, making this deal almost too good to pass up.","I keep comparing it to the 2MP SiPix camera my mother has... the Canon has so many more controls and flexibility in shooting, even if you aren't a pro, this camera makes you feel like one.  Also, the biggest benefit I've found is the LCD screen.  The SiPix screen is horrible in direct sunlight, but the Canon's is still clear and visible, even in the brightest sun!  The video mode is pretty good, especially when all I really wanted was a camera that took stills.  Definitely recommend this camera to anyone!  Just make sure you buy a bigger CompactFlash card, you'll be running back and forth to the computer all the time if you don't.","I bought this camera after extensive research and it has lived up to its almost unanimous accolades. It is small but fits nicely in the hand and feels balanced and substantial - not light and cheap. It packs so many features I am still rereading the manual. Flesh tones and white balancing seem very accurate on Auto but everything can be controlled manually if you wish. It seems to use power better than other cameras I've used; I can go several days without recharging or replacing my batteries (Ialways carry a spare, fully charged set). The software on the Macintosh is well designed. My daughter and I created a 360 degree QuickTime VR file of our living room in minutes. Canon recently released Mac OS X software and it functions beautifully. So far I could not be more pleased with my purchase.","I received this camera 4 days ago. It is really great for the price. I took pictures of the construction in my front yard to show my husband who is out of town. The software installation was a breeze. The photos look great. I even viewed them on our 32 inch TV. Can't wait to take this camera on our trip to Yosemite.<br />Now to the warning. Amazon lists a battery charger on the page with this camera. It is the Olympus charger and batteries. Do not buy this. According to Canon tech assistance, this camera requires batteries that are 1600's and no higher. The Olympus batteries are 1700's. I asked the tech guy if I had to use Canon batteries and he said no as long as I was aware of that 1600 number - any kind of battery with that number will work.<br />I must say that the batteries that came with the camera lasted longer than I thought they would. But as with anything digital, you really need rechargable batteries. I went to [local store], bought a charger, and an extra set of batteries as spares.","i have had my canon power shot a40 for about 3 months,the quality of the pictures i have taken are excellent.i have used a kodak 1 megapix camera and thought it gave nice results for the price,however after using the canon a40 for 1 day i couldnt believe how sharp the pictures were ,easier to use this camera feels like a proper 35 mm camera in your hands,it is well finished with all the moving parts on the camera feeling very robust,it has more settings than the average user will need and the auto mode gives me all the settings i will need,the video feature is only a novelty and will not be used after the first few weeks of use,i found the supplied batteries lasted only about a day although i took a lot of pictures,i have since bought a charger and better quality batteries,i forget the name of them but somthing like nmid which have twice the capacity of the alkaline batteries supplied,however the 8 mb card is rather stingy and i have bought a 128 mb card ,i wish the camera makers would get serious and stop putting these...little cards in and put somthing descent in ,the optical zoom is excellent but the digital zoom as with all digi cameras is really a gimmick,decreases your picture quality,all in all a superb camera for the serious amateur","I bought this camera during the first week fo April, when it had just released. I was not sure if it would be a good one or not as there were no reviews about it. It was a tough decision.<br />BTW: this is my first digital camera.<br />And i doubt I could have opted for a better one. Its a perfect balance between price and features. Infact, you can classify this camera as the best value for your money. If you are one of the people who just clicks for fun and is not into professional photography, this camera is awesome. 2MP is definitely not less in this case.<br />I have never really used the manual controls, but its definitely there for me to use some day. currently i am simply more than happy with the automatic controls and do not wanna tinker with the camera manually. The movie mode is pretty useful @ times as well, although its not utilized to its full capacity.<br />I also purchased a 128MB compact flash card, and that i should say is a must. The prices for those have dropped drastically as well. If u search hard for it, u can get one for as low as [money], which is a steal. its wise to buy this as u will realize that 8MB is not enough by any standards.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy this camera. Trust me, you will not regret it. Just go for it.","I bought this camera a couple of weeks ago, took it to my son's graduation and used it. I am very impressed with the quality of pictures and the short video, I took a video of my son getting his diploma and everybody kept watching it. I would highly recomend the camera, just do your homework on who you buy from if you order off the net.","After purchasing the Canon A40 4 weeks ago - I have found no major feature flaws or problems. This is a great camera. It has more manual features than I will ever use - but they are there if needed. It has manual control of exposure and ISO settings - but also has the convenience of automatic point-and-shoot AUTO mode. The program mode lets you add special effects like black and white, sepia, vivid color, neutral, and more. The stitch assist lets you create panoramic pictures with ease.<br />I bought Maha batteries and charger and have had no problems with power consumption.<br />At worst, the LCD is a little dark when lighting conditions are poor. But when the flash hits - the pictures look great. Very few hot spots and great colors.<br />A great camera with great features.","I just bought a Canon A40 last week.  I had narrowed the field down to the Canon and the Fuji Finepix 2600 and originally decided on the Fuji.  After taking the 2600 home for a night and messing with it a bit, I changed my mind and traded it in for the Canon.  There were several reasons...<br />-The Canon felt much more solid.  Part of this is the weight and size, being a bit bigger and heavier that a lot of digi cameras.  It will probably not fit in your average shirt pocket, but I like to keep it in the case or my hands most of the time anyway.  The upshot of the slightly bigger size is that the camera is laid out very well.  The Fuji seemed to have appendages, because the body was so small yet the LCD and buttons kind of hung off it.  The Fuji has a sliding door that covers the lens which felt pretty flimsy, whereas the Canon automatically retracts the lens and covers it when you power off or if you are in play mode for a length of time.<br />-The Canon had many more manual options.  Basically a full manual mode, programmed auto mode, and full auto mode.  The Fuji does not let you adjust ISO or shutter speed.<br />-Pics taken in low light were much better from the Canon.<br />-The LCD screen on the Canon, although a bit smaller than the Fuji, looked clearer and more true to the actual image.<br />-The movie mode on the Canon has audio, the Fuji does not.<br />-Finally, I just decided that I liked the Canon name better.<br />I am very happy I made the decision to get the Canon.  I have taken about 200 pictures since I got it and have had great results.  The software that came with it is quite useful.  Zoom browser EX makes it very easy to organize and view hundreds of photos at a time and the Arcsoft camera suite, while very obviously created for the consumer market, is very capable.<br />Stich mode works great and is super easy to set up.  Basically the CPU does all of the work for you.<br />My advice?  BUY THIS CAMERA.  You will not be dissapointed.  For less [the price], and with all the features (many found only on more expensive models) it is hard to go wrong.","I travel a lot and love to take phtographs.I have both Canon Rebel SLR (with many filters, lenses and flashes) and Elph LT APS cameras.<br />I find the Canon A40 is a great addition to my photgraphy bag! It adds enormous diversity and mobility.<br />I thought 2.0 megapixels might be less than satisfactory. Wrong! They look great shots on the highest compression and largest picture settings!<br />The control over AV, TV, and Manual are very similar to my Rebel 2000. I got way more than I expected in the creative control department. Black and white, sepia, exposure compensation and even panoramics! Did I mention the light balance for tungsten lighting? I need a filter for that on my SLR!<br />With the supplied A/V connections; I view my pictures, or even compose them, on my TV.<br />The supplied USB connection is fast. Some say not fast enough, without a Compact Flash card reader, I disagree. Eight high resolution pictures takes less than 2 minutes to upload!<br />The software supplied is superb. I'm still learning new things to do.<br />Combined with the Kodak rechargeable Ni-MH batteries the power lasts a lot longer. They are cheaper than the Canon batteries!<br />If your looking to add an economical, high quality, digital solution to your camera outfit, this is it!!","This camera has a multitude of features.  It takes great pictures and gives you functionality that you would expect in a higher priced camera.  I like the options available for reviewing pictures taken.  You zoom in or go to a specific picture using the thumbnail feature.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and bought I card reader along with the camera.  This allows you to save on batteries.","... Great add on 2x telephoto to give you a true 6x optical zoom.  Forget the digital zoom as you drop to equivilent of 1 mega pix if used. (this applies to all digital zooms). And remember, a 3x zoom on a digital is same as a 35-105 (apx) on a 35mm camera. A digital with a 6x optical zoom would really be great, but for the price ... and [more] for the extra 2x add on you can't buy any equivilent 6-10X optical zoom with all these features.","This camera is great.  Image quality at high resolution is great!  The movie mode is a nice feature for the outdoors, but quality indoors is not great.  Menu option are fairly easy to learn.  If you are not a camera expert the auto mode will adjust all the settings for you.  My only complaints are that the 8MB CF card that comes with it is too small (only about 11 picts at high res) and the batteries that are shipped with the camera won't last but a few hours.  I plan to get a larger CF card and rechargable NiMH batteries.  These two pitfalls are still not enough for me to discourage anyone from buying this camera.","I purchased the Canon A40 about 4 days ago, and have taken a few hundred pictures with it so far.  I bought it to replace my old Sony FD-73, which was only a 0.3 megapixel camera.  I wanted better quality and more storage options (greater capacity), so I started shopping around for a good quality 2.0MP Camera on Amazon.<br />The picture quality is excellent.  I noticed no chromatic abberation on any of the shots I took.  The pictures were crisp and clear, the colors were vibrant, and the pictures were good whether taken indoors or outdoors.  And, believe it or not, I'm still using the AA Alkaline batteries that came with the camera.  Even after several hundred pictures, they are still working.  I've read numerous reviews of cameras in this price range that drain batteries very quickly, I'm impressed that mine are still working.<br />I also tested the video mode of the camera.  It seems to automatically stop the video after about 10 seconds, I'm not sure if that setting can be changed.  The quality of the video was excellent and the audio quality was good, however the size of the video is something like 320x200 pixels (I don't remember precisely), which is quite small.  The 10 second video used about 3.7MB of space on the video card.  As everyone knows, the 8MB card that comes with it is useless. I threw it in the trash and bought a 256 SmartMedia card, which works great.  Based on the size of the pictures I took, full quality pictures at 1600x1200 averaged about 950K, while low quality pictures at 640x480 averaged about 145K.  Based on that, my 256MB card should hold about 270 pictures at the highest quality and 1700 pictures at the lowest quality.<br />I played around with the \"Stitch\" mode as well, which is supposed to help you paste together pictures into a panoramic shot.  It was very helpful.  Here's how it works:  It reduces the viewscreen so you can see two shots at once.  After you take the first picture, it puts it on the left side of the LCD view screen.  When you're ready to take the 2nd picture, you can line up the shot with the previous picture, so they'll line up correctly when you paste them together with your PC graphics program.  Supposedly, the camera automatically adjusts itself in Stitch mode so that the camera uses the exact same settings to try and keep the two pictures uniform.  There seems to be no limit to how many pictures the camera will let you \"stitch\" together.<br />The camera also offers numerous manual settings for the professional photographer.  You can manually adjust ISO speed, shutter speed, white balance, and many other features you would expect to find on a camera with a much higher price tag.<br />In sum, I'm very impressed with this little camera, and I think it is a great value for the price.  In my opinion, 2.0MP is the perfect quality for a casual user, Cameras in this range seem to offer the best combination of value, price, and picture quality.  I highly recommend it.<br />Good luck finding this camera, it always seems to be sold out on Amazon.  I guess that's a good sign!","My first experience with digital camera was with POWERSHOT A20.  It was awesome experience, the camera was very easy to use and producing lots of nice pictures too with great color balance too. It was awesome.  Then I found out about FINEPIX 2800, I gave my A20 to brother.<br />My second camera was FUJIFILM Finepix 2800 camera.  This is a nice camera but it's just a bit difference.  The one thing I don't like is the LCD everywhere.  The picture rather nice and the 6X real zoom, no digital zoom available with this camera.  I was a little bit dissapointed when I got this camera.<br />Then after a couple of weeks ago, I found out that CANON came up with new POWERSHOT A40 and I just rushed to the nearby electronic store and just bought the camera.  The result, again, just like I've already expected.  Just as nice as the A20 model.  The model just add better focusing just like the one that you can get from SLR camera like REBEL 2000 SLR.  It also has about 10 different effects (black & white, sepia, vivid, tungsten, and more.....) and you can even change the setting of the white balance, if you ever wanted.  It uses AA batteries, not the special one.  Make sure that you put it in AUTO mode so you can get everything just as easy as a snapshot camera.<br />THis is an excellent camera...OK guys, go get this one.......","I love this camera!<br />I could run down all the features individually and tell you how great they are, but instead I will keep it short and sweet and say that the camera is easy to use, takes beautiful photos, and is small and light enough to take everywhere.<br />It comes with all the cables you need to upload to your computer directly and show your photos on a TV. It even comes with editing software, 4 AA batteries to get you started, and an 8 MB memory card. I suggest you buy a 32 MB card or better. I got a 256 MB card myself, which holds 400 pictures at max resolution.<br />The only possible caveat is that it eats batteries quickly. Then again, I use it constantly, so the high battery consumption may be due to my heavy use and not just a hungriness on the camera's part...","We received the camera right in time for my sister's wedding.  Mother asked me to look at it and figure it out, which I was more than pleased to do.  It was an excellent camera, and I was impressed with all of the features provided.  Clarity was exceptional, ease-of use phenomenal, and it was a comfortable camera to use.  Was is the key word.  Less than a half an hour into testing it, something happened.  The view suddenly became extremely blurry and quite ugly.  I worked it over for another hour and a half, trying to figure out what happened.  None of the manuals would help, and I couldn't find anything online.  We had to send it back and use a disposable for my sister's wedding.  We ordered another digital camera, but we've found that we don't like it as much and are currently trying to find another Powershot A40....","Have been into digital photography for a couple of years.  This is my third camera and by far the best.  Picture quality is outstanding and the movie mode is a nice lanyap.  I have yet to have to enhance a picture with editing software and this was a must with the other cameras I've owned.","I recently bought 4 megapixel Kodak DX4900 that last 1 day before ti broke.  I then opted to go with Canon, and decided that I only needed a 2 mega pixel device. I went with the canon A40.  Unlike the Kodak, I have yet to see a blurry picture with this camera - its focus is incredible.  At 2 megapixels, the pictures are still bigger than my 17\" monitor screen and absolutely crystal clear.  These look like regular photos (big ones). The video mode is terrific (you wont watch it on tv or anything but for a small quicktime video I must say they are incredibly clear and the sound is wonderful).  This camera can be a simple point and shoot camera, or there are several modes that let you have total control over your picture quality - something a lot of cameras at this price lack.  Hats off to Canon for just a truly wonderful camera.  You will not go wrong with the Canon A40!","this camera is great, like the other people said it can make movies and is very \"fashionable\" in a camera kind of way. so like everything else i think is teh best, this camera deserves everyone one of its five stars","Very nice camera.....easy to use, and understand....lot's of options!  Pictures come out well, and video mode is also great.","I'm new to digital photography and was very impressed with Canon's A40.  The camera has similar features to the proven A20 model, but distinguishes itself in several ways.<br />For example, the A40 feels solid and is very attractive.  It also captures 10-30 second movie clips in AVI format which can be played on Quicktime.  The movie images are a bit grainy, but movements and sounds are captured quite well.  Using some software which was included with the A40, I was able to convert the AVI clips into MPEG and view them on my PocketPC.  Finally, the camera is less expensive than the A20, but delivers the same quality images.<br />My experience with the A40 pictures is that 2Mexapixels are fine.  The clarity of the images is remarkable.  And making short movie clips is an added benefit to getting the A40.<br />For the price and photo quality, the A40 is an exceptional product and deserves everyone of its 5 stars."]},{"name":"Kodak DX4900","amazon_reviews":["Nice camera, easy to use.","This is a replacement for my DX4900 Kodak Camera that I have used for years.

Recommend it highly for good all around usage.","I received the DX4900 w/dock and accessories a little over a year ago as a present from my spouse.  It was  my first digital camera and has allowed me to become comfortable with using a digital camera.  However, as other reviewers have mentioned, I had problems with my camera.  At the time the problems fell under the one year warranty.  When I got the camera back the first time, it did not work from the get-go.  I had to turn right around and send it back for repair.  (Which, by the way, if Kodak determines that the damage to the camera is due to it being dropped or the like you have to pay for the repair reguardless of the warranty.)  The camera has worked fine since the second repair.<br />The zoom function is disappointing.  It works fairly well for zooming in on up close portrait type shots or focusing in on some group shots.  I prefer a lot more zooming ability.  Some pics, on occation, turn out blurry for no apparent reason.  And to determine if the pic is blurry before you download or print it you have to take the time to change the function on the camera and use the zoom function on the LCD--possibly blowing good photo opportunities.<br />I can turn out pretty good prints on my home printer (Dell).  The picture quality is good even on larger pictures.  It works really well for emailing pictures as well.  The dock is very convenient.  The photo editing software is OK, but could be better.  One of the options on the editing software is the \"Auto Enhance\" which almost always seems to lighten the pics up too much and makes the complection of the subject very washed out.  The \"Exposure\" function in the software works better if a pic needs overall adjustment usually.<br />Overall this is a good beginner's digital camera, but after one year of having the camera I am now longing for a Minolta Dimage.  (Wow!  What a Zoom!)","Short battery life, limited 2X zoom, small view finder which washes out in bright light. Not a bad camera when I bought it about a year ago, but today \"You can do better\"","I find this camera very easy to use, and am impressed with the quality of the pictures it takes, especially in the larger sizes.  The photos are comparable with those taken with much more expensive digital cameras.  The only drawback I have found is that it will not take short movies, but the price more than makes up for this.","This camera is basically an OK camera, but it has major problems if you plan on using the rechargable batteries that come with the docking station. The battery consistently reads a \"false high\" reading and claims that the battery is fully charged. I've contacted Kodak about it and they are aware of the problem (funny, they didn't make ME aware of it till I had already bought the camera). Their solution is to charge the battery for roughly 10 minutes at a pop (that being the average time till the charger says it's \"full\"), take the camera out of the charger for 5 minutes, and repeat this process until you have a combined charge time of 2 hours (for the non-math wizards, that's 12 reps of this process). They CLAIM that, once you do this, the battery will operate correctly (but they LIE..), My battery still will take approximately 15 pictures before going kaput.. The non-rechargable battery works like a champ, but don't believe them about the rechargable batteries giving good results..","This is my second camera, I find this one easy to use and understand how to use it. I love it, and happy that I am finally taking pictures again.","I recently purchased the Kodak EasyShare DX4900.<br />The camera was very easy to use. Just pop it out of the box and pop in the battery and storage card and start shooting.<br />I pulled my first pictures up on my PC and the TV and they look great.<br />One thing that Kodak didn't tout that one of my co-workers thought was kind of cool is the different battery types it can use. Mine came with a Lithium battery that I've seen for 5 bucks and is supposed to last over 300 pictures. My co-worker was concerned about having to buy more batteries but looking in the manual it supports many different kinds, including rechargeables.<br />I like the camera since I'm not a photo pro.  I have to say the cameras auto selection for flash etc. resulted in some good pics.<br />The only thing I had a problem with is that the LCD screen turns off fairly quickly.<br />I can highly recommend this camera.","This being the first digital camera I have owned I did alot of backgrounding in making my decision. This is definitely a great camera for the money. The directions are easy to follow and the quality of pictures is awesome. I would reccomend this camera for any beginer.","What a great camera for those of you who want really high quality picture at a great price. You can't beat this!","Overall I am very pleased with the camera. The software is easy to use. I purchased the camera dock with the camera, right out of the box, the power supply was defective and after 20 minutes of filling out the required forms & photo copying receipts and sending the old power supply back I recieved a replacement power supply in just a couple of days. In my opinion the rechargable battery that comes with the camera dock is junk, I was only able to take 3 to 4 pictures before going into \"Low Battery\", purchasing new batteries resolved this problem.<br />I like to think I did my research on the 4.0 MP cameras and for the price you can't beat it.","About \"fredrockman's\" review, (15 pics with full charged battery)I had the same problem but it turned to be the battery pack, Using a CRV3 pack, you can take about 250 pictures. Besides you can always get some other brand of rechargable batteries. For me its working great. If you have the same problem get a CRV3 pack.","Overall, if you're looking for a flexible, easy-to-use, easy-to-learn digi-cam, the DX4900 from Kodak is a nice place to start.  It's basically a point and shoot camera that makes digital photography accessible even to non-techies.<br />FEATURES:<br />Digital Camera:  At it's highest resolution of 2272 X 1704 it can hold about 20 pictures or so.  The easy to review LCD screen gives you instant feedback on your pictures and helps you decide on the spot whether or not they are worth keeping.  You can add on another memory card to give you even more flexibility with the number of shots you can take.  Plus, at a whopping 4.0 megapixels, this camera is at the high-end of printing and picture resolution in the digi-cam market.  For quality pictures you'll want to stick to cameras at 3.0 megapixels or up, definitely no less than 2.0 megapixels.<br />Easily Works With Your PC:<br />The DX4900 connects easily with your PC and comes with transfer software so you can easily download, edit and e-mail your pictures and videos, thus allowing you to share your pictures easier with family and friends.<br />NOTE:<br />One of the most frustrating aspects about digi-cams are the \"short-lives\" of the batteries that come with them.  Batteries tend to die out quickly, especially if you use the LCD monitor on the camera (which is one of the best things about digi-cams).  Based on other reviews it seems that a lot of users have complained about the \"power issues\" with the DX series of cams (and other digi-cams as well).  You'll definitely want to invest in the Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock II which comes with rechargeable batteries and helps make the picture transfer process easier.<br />My investment in the camera dock has helped keep my cameras (I own two) in tip-top working condition.  Trust me, if you plan to get good use of out your camera, invest in the camera dock and NI-MH rechargeable batteries.  It will save you a lot of frustration when your camera does not die out on you at an inopportune moment.<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Overall, if you need a nice, easy to use camera to record your everday (and not so everyday) moments, the DX4900 is a great camera to start with.  At 4.0 megapixels, the quality of your pictures will be the envy of your family and friends.  For everyday/normal/touristy use, this is just perfect.<br />Highly Recommended","This camera is a good deal. It is aimed towards the people who want to take out the camera, push the button, and not have to deal with other [stuff]. While sometimes I wish for a bit more freedom and control, it does make photography easy and accessible. Some downfalls are the lack of real zoom. 2x isn't much, and the digital zoom quickly reduces the quality of the picture. Getting a really close up shot of something is very tough also. Overall a good deal, the software that comes with it is easy to use and helpful, if a bit simplistic. I would say that getting at least a 64 mb memory card is necessary, as the included one is too small to be of any real use. I got a 128 mb card for (US)[money] after a mail-in rebate, and it holds 102 pictures at highest quality. Good quality, easy interface, though sometimes lacking in freedom to tweak camera settings. Another necessary purchase with this is 4 AA Ni-Mh batteries and a charger... so that you can have one set in the camera and one set charging. I don't recommend getting the \"dock\" or anything like that, very simple and quick to transfer pictures with the included USB cable. It takes maybe 3-4 seconds per picture on highest quality.","I got this camera a month ago. It's cheap, very easy to use but not the \"idiot camera\". It provides many useful functions. The image quality is much better than my expectation except a little bit reddish. The reddish effect will let the portrait look warmer and more vivid, but not so good if you want to capture the tree or mountain. But it is not difficult to use Photoshop to lower the red level. I love the ISO setting. ISO 100 will give you very good detail. No noise at all. The printout photo is amazing. I am very satisfied with the auto point and shot of this camera, it really does a good job. But the camera has some defects need to be fixed in the next generation. 1) The LCD doesn't have the anti-flare layer, so it is very dim under the sunlight. 2) 2X digital zoom has very good effect, but no as enough as those 4M peers. 3) Seems like the camera compressing JPEG too much. The Cannon and Sony 4M camera give bigger image file (1.5-2M) and Kodak only gives 1-1.4M. I think it will loss some detail. I give it 5 stars because you can't find such a good camera with the small money.","I spent many hours researching digital cameras.<br />My guidline was \"the very best picture possible for the money\".<br />This camera takes pictures in breathtaking clairity along with bright vivid color.<br />I have printed some of my pictures on photo paper on a HP Deskjet 895Cse. Every person that views these printed pictures can not believe that the photos were not devloped from negatives, also everyone asked \"what digital camera do you have and how much does it cost\".  My 895Cse is just an average ... printer.  The camera is very easy and fun to use. This Camera exceeded all my expectations especilly in photo quality.<br />  Following are a few insights.<br />1. I purchased a Sandisk 256mb ultra memory card ... This is more card than you need.  I can take 206 4MP pictures before the card is full.  I recomend Sandisk ultra card but only the 128mb. (the ultra card is very fast, I can snap off pictures within 2-3 seconds one after the other).<br />2.The camera includes a usb cable,with the Sandisk card and XP os my pictures transfer from my camera to my computer fast,(less than one min. for 250 4mp pictures). I opted to not purchase the \"camera dock\" instead I purchased a \"monster\" battery charger that came with 2 sets of NiMH batteries plus an additional 2 sets of batteries,... These digital cameras use up batteries fast. The camera comes with batteries that can only be charged using the kodak camera dock,(the batteries only work with the kodak camera).<br />Even if you do not think you will use all these batteries, using the regular NiMH batteries and charger is the way to go, your batteries can be used in other devices and the charger is compact and easy to carry with you, the Kodak camera dock is larger and can only charge kodak batteries.... Each set of fully charged batteries will take apprx 40 pictures using the cameras digital view.<br />3. The Camera does not come with a case. I purchased a perfect case at Compusa for [money].<br />4. You Should Buy this Camera, Everytime I use mine I know I made the right choice !!","I have this camera, the pictures are enormous and the quality is out of this world. I would have liked to see the camera be able to make 15 second videos. That and the battery life are the two down-falls of the camera. All in all, the camera is a good buy!","This is my first digital camera, and for the most part I was able to operate it without even reading the manual. My 14 year old has no problem operating it either. I think this is a great camera for beginners.","I bought this camera for my wife's birthday to replace a 1MP Agfa (a great camera in it's time). The pictures are excellent quality/crispness and you can easily print 8x10's without loss of clarity (with a good printer). Kodak is also great on support/repairs. My wife dropped the camera (though she won't admit it) and the thing stopped working. We sent it in to Kodak (under warranty) and about a week later had it back in working order. This camera is well worth the price.","I've gone through 4 consumer-level digital cameras in the last two years (bad luck?), luckily under warranty :).  This is really the best.  I started with an old HP 315, which was a fun camera (2mp), but very stripped down.  When that broke, I got a Kodak 3900 (this fellow's precursor - 3.1 mp), which I loved.  The colors were truer than those of the HP, the macro mode was impressive for as cheap of a digital as it is, and the focusing seemed to come more easily.  That died on me and I had a very brief stint with an HP 715 (3mp, discontinued, a piece of [poo], that was my only choice with my replacement warranty at that time).  I couldn't get it to interface properly with my computer (I work with computers, too, it just wasn't a good camera) and returned it for my 4900.  Although the lens on the big HP is superior, the extra megapixels in the 4900 as well as the ease of use more than make up for it.  I enjoy using the b&w modes to test out scenes before taking a picture with my SLR and it works great for that.  It takes decent night pictures (just don't shake it around, unless you want some interesting effects), great outdoor pictures.  The light sensor is fairly predictable.  People that know a bit about exposure will appreciate the exposure compensation button - the EV values that they list seem to line up fairly well with my SLR, too.<br />The upload time is FAST (less than a second per highest quality picture as compared to 4-5 seconds per picture on the HP 715), the pictures take awhile to store, but you can rack up a few in sequence and it'll just store them as you're taking more.  The viewfinder *is* fairly inaccurate, so if you're striving for a perfect shot, use the screen (especially in macro mode).  That said, it's great to save batteries with the view-finder.  You just end up getting more in the picture that you bargained for, which can be cropped.  With the HP715, I found I'd always get slightly less than the viewfinder advertised (not good).<br />The 2X optical zoom / 3X digital mix would be better reversed :) but that would bump up the price of the camera.  I'm sure this is one way Kodal trimmed features.  Still, I had NO optical zoon on my first digital, so this is about all I'm used to.<br />Also, after using the HP715 for a couple of weeks, I've learned to appreciate the speed of focusing, even in a slightly lower light.  I could NOT get an infocus picture with the HP because the focusing mechanism just woudln't catch.  It had the curious habit of always focusing on the background, even if there was a large light-coloured object in the foreground that I was going for.  That's not how most autofocus sensors work and, happily, that's not how Kodak does theirs.<br />For a point-and-shoot, I'd call this a pleasure to use.  If you're looking for supreme control, it's probably not the camera for you.  I think the price is well-balanced with the feautres that are offered, though.","This camera seems like a great bargain at it's ... price. I love that it has 4 megapixils, more features than the other EasyShare Kodak cameras, unbelievable simplicity of use, and a relatively small (pocket) size. The best feature in my opinion is that you can autofocus and take a picture in about half a second, which is great for a digital camera. (If you try to take more than one picture that quick, forget it, things slow down a lot after the first picture.)<br />I took about 200 photos in my first week with this camera and I couldn't believe how great they looked on my screen... until I looked at them at their true size (100% image size). All of the pictures are grainy when you look at them at their full size. Look at them at 75% size and they look great. What I think this means is that the camera is really more like a 2-3 megapixil camera that makes images in the 4 megapixil size. If you are printing 4x6 images you won't have a problem with the camera's resolution, but don't believe what Kodak says on the box that you can have \"Crisp, clear Prints at any size even up to 20x30 poster.\" It just isn't true. My 8x10 prints of DX4900 images on my photoprinter look pleasing but have very visible graininess that I never saw when I printed on the same printer using images from my old 3 megapixil sony camera. I called Kodak tech support and told them about this problem, they told me to return the camera because it must be defective. I took Kodak's advice but my new DX4900 has the same problem with its images. I hate knowing that I bought a camera that doesn't really live up to its marketing and my hopes.<br />One other love/hate thing about the camera: its images are often under 1MB in file size. They would be a good deal larger on most 4 megapixil digital cameras. This means you can get more images on a memory card... a good thing. Unfortunately, it means the DX4900 is compressing the images a lot and highly compressed images lose quality. There is no way to force the camera to decrease the compression of the images, only to increase the compression.<br />When considering the Kodak DX4900 you have to ask yourself the question \"can I be happy sacrificing image quality for a lower price and ease of use?\" It is a tough question to answer. Buying a cheaper 2-3 megapixil camera or a more expensive higher quality 4 megapixil camera may ultimately be more satisfying options.","I am usually the one out of family and friends who has the absolute WORST pictures!  The last straw was when I went to Chicago and forgot to turn my flash on for all the indoor shots.  In fact, I forgot to turn it on for ALL of the pictures.  Needless to say, I got about 5 good shots of the Chicago skyline and a whole lotta GRAY pictures.  So, it was time to look into digital technology.  I wanted a digital camera for the instant preview and ability to delete a bad one in mere seconds.  I am a photography novice, and I needed something for point-and-shoot situations.  The Kodak EasyShare DX4900 hit the jackpot.  Easy to use, lightweight and not bulky (but not so little that I would get a hand cramp from trying to hold onto it!), automatic EVERYTHING, and a super little LCD screen to view my pictures.  The big test was on a trip to California.  I have pictures that are, in my opinion, museum quality.  Or at least postcard quality.  I have never been more pleased with a piece of equipment!<br />A few drawbacks - the EasyShare dock is NOT included, and it is necessary! (...additional $..., so figure adding that into your spending budget as I did), and the little LCD screen get a little smudgy at times (nothing a quick swipe with an eyeglasses-cleaning cloth couldn't handle), and the rechargable battery didn't last very long.  When you see the CRV 3V Lithium Batteries on sale, STOCK UP. ...a frequent photographer could go broke!  The zoom lens is a little sub-par, but I didn't really notice since I have never had a camera with a zoom lens, anyway.  Also, if you are considering purchasing a digital camera and want to rely on the LCD screen as your viewfinder, you might be disappointed with the Kodak EasyShare DX4900.  Using it that way will eat your batteries, and the image is a little shaky and grainy.  I got used to the regular viewfinder real quick!<br />To conclude, I highly recommend this camera to those just starting out in digital technology.  You won't be disappointed!","The camera performs excellently, and is quite full-featured. Picture quality is exceptional, and the camera overall is extremely easy to use. I do wish that it had just a little better optical zoom - even 3:1 or 4:1, but it still is very good. This would have been a perfect experience but for two things, both related to the camera dock II.<br />First, the rechargeable battery, although brand new and charged properly, only seems to last about 15 minutes before it is dead.<br />Second, installation of the USB connected-docking station could be a bit more verbose, and there could be some diagnostic tools for debugging communication problems. As it stands, Kodak doesn't seem to have very good tools or help for determining why the docking station may not work. I did get mine to work, but it took nearly a day of fussing with it before it would (and a non computer savvy person might have given up). Now mind you, the reason for it not working was not the camera's or the docking station's *fault*, per se, but it was its *problem*, if you know what I mean...and Kodak could have provided some better help and diagnostics.<br />Admittedly, once it worked, it worked fast and flawlessly, transferring about 2 4Mpixel shots per second. So almost a perfect experience.","One of the best values in the digital camera world. If anyone is looking to get into the world of digital photography, or anyone looking to move up to a camera with higher resolution - this camera is it! At 4.0 mega-pixels - the photos from the DX4900 are just stunning. Take some close-up shots using the macro mode and you will be amazed at the detail this camera picks up. You will really see the detail and true to life color if you have some of your photos printed at a photo center. With my Apple iMac Computer and Mac OS X, using this camera is truly 'plug and play'. You don't even have to install any software to download your photos to the computer - the software is built into OS X. Just plug one end of the included USB cable to the DX 4900 and the other end to the Mac (no need for the Kodak docking station) and your photos are automatically transferred. What could be easier. Battery life is very good with this camera - I have taken almost a hundred shots, at the highest resolution, with just one pair of rechargeable batteries. Another plus is that this camera uses Compact Flash (CF) storage media. This is the most widely used storage media format in digital cameras and also the least expensive. Get the largest capacity CF card you can afford, believe me you'll use it.<br /> 128MB or 256MB cards are the best value in my opinion. The zoom capabilities are a bit limited by the 2X optical zoom lens. The 3X digital zoom, in effect, allows for a total zoom of 6X - but at a cost to clarity.<br /> But overall, this is one great digital camera!","I bought this camera because my uncle had one, and I saw the quality of the pictures it took.  After I got it for myself, I found out the picture quality wasn't the only great thing about it.  The LCD display on the camera is crystal clear, and the menus are colorful and easy to navigate.<br />Software installation was a little tricky, but I'm one of those people who doesn't like to read manuals.<br />But the coolest thing about this camera that many people don't mention is the video out jack.  It comes with a cable that plugs into the camera, and the other end plugs into a TV or VCR.  Then, you just turn the camera on, and the output from the LCD shows up on the TV - the camera will even do a slide show for you!  Forget printing pictures, when I want to show people the shots I took, I just plug the camera into their TV, and everyone in the room can see!...","This camera is the easiest camera to use and the best price for 4MP.  It's a point and click that's easy enough for any person to use and has other features that make this camera fun from amateurs to novice.  They look excellent on prints.  I developed some to have them framed and the rest is sitting in my computer and my ofoto (Kodak film processing) account.  With this kind of resolution, this price cannot be beat!!","it doesn't work with my win2k. i wasted a lot time trying to make it work under win2k. then i found win2k said it doesn't suport KODAK DX4900. now, i have to upgrade my computer to XP. this camera works fine under winXP. the image is good. but i really think the driver issue bother me too much. forgot to mention that works fine on my boyfriend's winME.","I purchased the Kodak DX 4900 EasyShare camera in hopes that it would be an easy camera for my wife to use to take pictures of our kids.  The camera meets our needs and takes great pictures of people.  I was not certain about the docking solution but it has been a great purchase.  The camera is always charged and ready for more pictures.  With one touch of a button on the dock, all the files are sent over our computer network to a server, renamed with the date appended, and deleted from the camera.  I have not otherwise tested the software.","This is my second Kodak digital camera, and like my first, I am not disappointed.  Wonderful, crisp, clear pictures.  I take a lot of close up pictures of flowers in my garden, and the built in macros is excellent.","For the price you pay for this camera, its worth every penny. Its compact enough to store in your pockets when not in use. I own a 1.3 Megapixel camera and yes there is a big difference. No matter what the guy at the electronic store say. This is a must buy.","In this day of high tech gizmos and gadgets, many items are complicated to the point to where the consumer must have an<br />engineering degree in order to understand.  NOT so with this camera!!! This is the most user friendly camera I have ever<br />had the pleasure to handle.  Before investing this kind of<br />money into something as high tech as a digital camera, I looked at several brands over many weeks.  I selected the Kodak DX4900 for it's simplicity of use and ease of understanding the easy<br />to read manual. I can now say that after over 1000 pictures<br />taken at all levels of megapixels that this camera lives up to<br />the advertisements by Kodak and more.  You can't go wrong with<br />this one at all.","Well, if I were to write a one word review on this baby, I would just say, \"WOW!\", but it wouldn't do any justice to this little gem of a camera.<br />I just started fiddling with digital cameras fairly recently (in the last 6 months) and after getting a ZR45MC camcorder/camera, I longed for a better camera that can do some excellent digital stills.  After reviewing all the digital cameras available in the market that can do some excellent photos, PLUS is reasonably priced (this one is the cheapest 4-megapixel camera in the market), I ended up getting this camera, and I'm sooo glad I got this!  Even for someone who doesn't know much about photography (like me) this camera can take some excellent photos without much tweaking at all.  I've yet to learn the more advanced features it has like exposure settings, sharpness, ISO settings, shutter speed, closeups/distant focusing, and a number of others, but I'm already taking some pretty good photographs even without all the tweaking.  I can only imagine how much better my photos will look IF I master this camera!<br />Also, if you have a very good photo printer (I have an HP Photosmart 1315), you can just directly take out the compactflash card out of the Kodak DX4900 and insert it in the HP Photosmart printer's card reader, and out comes an EXCELLENT, photolab-quality photo!  A friend of mine wouldn't believe that I did all these myself and thought I had it professionally done at a photo store like Ritz Camera.<br />Overall, I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants some excellent photos but doesn't want to do any major tweaking just to get great-looking shots.  I HIGHLY recommend this one!","Well, if I were to write a one word review on this baby, I would just say, \"WOW!\", but it wouldn't do any justice to this little gem of a camera.<br />I just started fiddling with digital cameras fairly recently (in the last 6 months) and after getting a ZR45MC camcorder/camera, I longed for a better camera that can do some excellent digital stills.

I HIGHLY recommend this one!","Extremely happy with the pictures the camera takes and the bells and whistles on it.  Easy to use and with the great resolution, you can crop unwanted stuff out of your pictures.<br />Unhappy with the cheap plastic feel, even unhappier when the little plastic battery slide broke off so the camera can't stay powered.  Kodak promised to fix it without any arguments, but it needs better workmanship, maybe metal parts instead of plastic?<br />I'll be treating it to a well padded camera case when I get it back!","I have been a digital photography early adopter, and this is my fifth digital camera. I owned two Olympus, one Sony Mavica, and one Kodak before this one. When I received the DX4900 I was somewhat disappointed for its lightweight and plastic case but I have to admit that this is the best combination of features and capabilities for under 400 bucks. At this time (July 11th) you hardly would find any 4MP camera for under $500, and Kodak just do it with this gem.<br />Very easy to use, and yet plenty of settings to tweak if you are like me. I love the ISO setting and the exposure, just to mention two. My only complaint come for the 2X optical Zoom. If you are looking a camera for remote photography, maybe you should look for some Mavica models which delivers up to 20X.<br />The Kodak DX4900 speed is quite good (compared to an eternity in any Mavica), and the image quality, after some fine tuning, is great. The software included is a good start kit, but you may better consider some professional or semi-professional image editor instead.<br />And you absolutly will need more memory! 16MB is simply not enough. Consider at least an additional 64MB CF card.<br />I think this camera will be with me for a long long time!","I recently bought this camera after postponing a digital camera purchase for a long time -- I just didn't find what I thought I'd want before at a price I could afford.  The stated combination of features and cost grabbed my attention.  It is a great combination of satisfying picture, options to fiddle with and ease of use for this middle-aged, amatuer-plus-a-little 35mm user but new digital camera user who wants more than just a \"fun\" camera.","This camera has enough good features to make it quite useful. The 2:1 optical zoom is its Achilles Heel, but the 4 megapixel resolution is outstanding for anyone who wants to do some serious photo enlarging (adequate for printing 11\" x 14\" photos). The optional docking station (not included in this package) makes this a very simple camera to recharge and it also makes the transferring of images to a PC almost foolproof. That means a great deal, as the 4900, left in its cradle, is always charged and ready to go, and once returned to its cradle, archiving or emailing becomes an easy task even for a novice. The overall quality is good, though there's a bit of a  cheap plastic feel to it. The weight and balance are also just fair. Lastly, the included memory card is too small but larger cards are readily available. Overall this is a very nice package for the casual user or new digital photographer.","I love the camera.  Just watch out with photo transfering.  The photos get transfered to both the photo transfer software as well as the Kodak pictures folder on your desktop.  That's fine.  However, if you delete the pictures from your photo transfer software, they are also deleted from the folder and lost forever.  The solution is to either transfer the pics to another folder or when starting up the transfer software, press and hold control, alt and shift...it will then delete the pics only within the transfer software.  Otherwise, no complaints at all and would recommend wholeheartedly!","My first introduction into digital photography was with the low end Olympus camera.  When I made the decision to upgrade I did alot of research and came to the conclusion that there were several good options for quality digital cameras in the $400 price range. After reading many reviews and speaking to many people who were familiar with both the Sony, Canon, and Kodak I opted for the Kodak 4900.  I am extrememly pleased with my decision and love this camera and its' docking station (a must).<br />I just returned from a three week European vacation and had such a blast taking pictures, deleting those I did not like, retaking the picture with different settings, etc.  This camera has alot of flexibility but is so very easy to use.  After spending 30 minutes reading the instruction book I was good-to-go.  One of the things that amazed me with this camera is what good pictures it took in low light conditions.  All I had to do was make an adjustment to the light conditions on the camera; I was able to take great pictures up on the bright snowy alps as well as pictures of a lit up castle on a hill at dusk.<br />I agree with a previous review on the Kodak editing software that came with my camera.  I do not like it and have opted to use PhotoSuite software to fine tune my pictures.  I upgrated the memory to 128MB and purchased 2 sets of rechargeable double AA batteries and a charger (for $20).  With the docking station the rechargeabe batteries aren't really even necessary but they came in handy during my vacation.<br />One last comment, I watched the sales ads.  Best Buy had the camera on sale for $349.00  I took the ad to Circuit City and they matched the price-as well as threw in 2 packs of photo software.","I'm a novice with cameras, but I knew I wanted a digital.  I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this one was to operate and how many features it had!","I researched the digital camera market for 4 months.  The Kodak<br />was the best value for the money at 4MP. I got 25% off at Sears<br />which made the value better.  I recently bought the telephoto<br />and lens adapter through Kodak. The telephoto was [price]. Pretty good deal.<br />The Easy Dock is great for loading pictures and E-mail to family<br />and friends.  It is a great toy to experiment and have fun.<br />Patrick","After watching the digital camera market and its products for quite some time, I've finally arrived and purchased my first one.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  The camera is easy to use.  The bells and whistles are intuitive.  My spouse is not a gadgetry person by any means but was able to use the camera in no time.  The images are simply astounding at the 4.0MP resolution!  Don't listen to the negative review in this list of reviews--you'll like this camera unless you're nearly a pro.","This camera takes flawless photographs at almost any distance, and at almost any light.  There are lower resolution modes and also a high-compression mode, but this does degrade the quality of the image (perhaps the reason for some of the unfavorable reviews?).  Also, Kodak has some extra lenses available, one of them being a 2x zoom lense (I've ordered it, but it's still in the mail), which I am hoping will give me 1x to 4x zoom, which is actually BETTER than the 3x zoom you get on most digital cameras.  They also have a close-up lense for taking pictures of things like stamps if you are interested in that sort of thing.<br />The downside is that you don't get a camera bag, and the 16MB memory card is too small.  I think the 64MB memory card is perfect for me, but then I have a laptop that I can take with me and dump the pictures onto when the card gets full.  The camera also comes with a lithium battery, so you still need to buy either a charger or a cradle (both come with one rechargable battery pack).  Buy an extra battery pack so you don't get caught without juice!  The lithium battery packs last only about twice as long as a charged battery pack, but they cost more ..., so definitely go rechargable!<br />Even without accessories, however, this is a great camera, and you can't get this kind of resolution for this price anywhere else.  I've taken some absolutely breathtaking nature photographs after having the camera for only a few days.  The automatic shutter speed is great for evening and low light situations, and I haven't even tried some of the cooler features of the camera yet.<br />One more thing - think about investing in some photo-editing software.  The camera takes great base pictures, but they still need to be brightness, contrast, and color adjusted.  And cropped.  And retouched.  I like the ULead stuff myself, because it is [reasonably priced] and powerful.  But there are a number of very good tools available for less than [money], and you can really spruce up your favorite photos pretty quickly and easily with the right software.  In my opinion, it is the ability to edit the photos that MAKES digital photography so powerful, and the higher resolution you go in with, the better the end result.  Although Kodak provides some image editing software with the camera, it was really pretty poor.  I definitely recommend getting something better (though you may not need it at first depending on what you want to do, and your level of experience).<br />Great camera, great pictures, great price.  Plan on spending at least another [money] on accessories (battery charger or cradle, memory card update, camera bag, optional add-on lenses), and maybe [money] on software if you don't already have a favorite image editing tool.  Once you have it all in place though, you get to take as many high-resolution photos as you want to for almost free!  And I am telling you, I was just blown away at how some of my photos came out.  Breathtaking!","Someone else complained about some features of this camera and they just aren't true.  While it is difficult to see the LCD in sunlight, it's like that on all cameras.  And this does have a video out.  Images are 35MM quality and it doesn't take 13 seconds to write to the disk.  While it does only have 2x zoom and no mpg mode, it does what I bought it for: to take pictures.  And if you already have a charger for batteries the docking station is not essential.  Overall this is a great camera that takes great pictures and is very easy to use.","Great camera with a good price.  Its Very easy to use and takes extremely crisp, clear pictures.  The dock is great to keep your batteries charged and you need at least a 128mb card.  I wish the camera came with better zoom...but once i bought the additional telephoto lens, i was not disappointed at all.  Can't go wrong with this camera.","This is my first digital camera and so far I love it.  After a lot of studying I thought I knew what I wanted.  I was looking at 2MP's because of price.  I did some comparing when I got to the store and ended up buying this one.  I love it, the price was great, its simple to use, and the pictures turned out perfect.  Can't go wrong with this one.","On the whole, a good camera for the price with one serious limitation. For some reason, Kodak has decided to stop letting the DX series of cameras write from the computer to the compactflash card. You need a separate card reader to add files to the card.","I researched digital cameras for a long time before I decided on the Kodak DX4900. I have owned one for over a month and absolutely love it!  Easy to use, on-board menu, and the camera takes beautiful photos. I have designed book covers for novels by using photos taken by this camera and editing with Picture It! software. One touch picture downloading from the docking system is the way to go, also it keeps the batteries charged.  My next purchase will be a 128 memory card to expand the number of photos I can take at the highest resolution. I thought the dock was overpriced personally, but still worth the price for convenience purposes.","I'll make it short and sweet. I own a cheaper, bottom of the barrel digi camera, and the comparison can only be explained in so many words...... If you want great pictures at a reasonable price, this is the one.","Recently I have purchased this camera, my first digital camera and the resolutions, the printing, is simply the best. It is for both begginers and Intermidate photogrophers. It is affordable and it's worth the price. I highly recommend this camera. What better deal can you get?","This camera take beatiful pictures, I really love it. I have a film camera from CANNON, I do not think I will use it anymore. Be sue to get a large Compactdisk (128 or 256 MB)<br />It is also very convienent. What I am now doing is  to copy the pic to the ZIP disk, bring it to walmark, they are printed it in less than 1 hour. It only cost you 0.29 cent per one.<br />I have use this camera for almost 3 month. I have taken almost hundreds of pic. The color of this camera is so natural, and I think Kadak do its best to recover the original color in this category of camera. It is better than the film camera I have from Cannon. I will give my new film camera to my sister  sinceI did not use it any longer<br />Do not beleive the negative comment from the view. Buy this one, you will like it. It is the best value I have ever seen. Even the software it provides is good.","After shopping around for a digital camera.  I decided to buy the DX4900.  This is a great camera that takes excellent pictures.  When the pictures are printed by a photo lab, it looks like a picture from a film camera.  Most people will not be able to distinguish between the digital print and the film one.  The camera is made of plastic and is very light.  For some, it may feel a little cheap but the pictures definitely makes up for it.<br />  I would also recommend a 128 mb card that will take about 100 photos at 4MP.  The included 16 mb card will only hold about 12 photos.<br />  This is my second digital camera and I am very pleased with it.  I highly recommend this camera.  Oh yeah, did I mention this camera was rated #1 in picture quality...etc ($300-$499 range of cameras) at the 2002 PMA convention.","I just got back from vacation, and am really impressed with the quality of my photos.  Even after cropping one picture to less than a 1/4 of it's original size, it still printed out a great 4x6 picture, with little to no grain.  I haven't printed out a 8x5 yet, but I'm guessing I'll be limited more by my printer than by the camera.<br />It's a great camera - you'll need a bigger card than what given with it though.<br />The docking station is ok, it's easy, but if you're at all computer literate, it's just a nice-to-have.","I've had this camera for two weeks now and I feel very justified in saying...stop looking and buy this one. What an amazing deal! This camera is easy to use, has tons of great features (the dock that keeps your battery charged is a must, as is a 128mb card) and takes beautiful pictures. I waited to write my review until I got some hard copies back from the kodak print center and they look even better than my 35mm. I can honestly say that I will never need more camera than this. I use it for the kids sporting events and have tried it indoors and out. There simply isn't a reason not to go with this camera. Some of the 2 megapixel cameras are going for the same price. Definitely won't disappoint.","Kodak has stormed the digital camera market with it's EasyShare system.  EasyShare makes digital pics as easy as traditional photography.  With online printing services it is now possible to get the same quality from a digital camera as from traditional photography.<br />Kodak 4900 broke the megapixel/price barrier by bringing out a jaw-droppingly extraordinary 4 Megapixel camera at less than [amount]. Kodak's unequaled color capture capabilities in its digital cameras is evident in the 4900 as well as enough features to keep all but professional photographers happy for years.<br />With the 4900 it will be possible to crop pictures and still get beautiful 5x7 and 8x10s!  Uncropped 16x20s and larger are possible from Ofoto (the best online print solution).<br />The only way to get a camera nearly as good as this is to spend 2-3 times as much money. Even at triple the money camera is as easy to use for great prints as the 4900.<br />Darn, this is a REALLY good buy for a REALLY great camera.","Kodak's under [money] for a real 4 mega-pixel, multi-funtion digital camera that is comfortable,easy to use & comes with a 16MB CF card & lithium battery. The software is well designed & easy to use. A must is the docking station for another ..., but well worth it - besides the 1 button load to your PC, you get a rechargeable NiMh.

She is said to be a mischeivious 18 month old girl with an appetite for shiny objects with buttons. This is not her first murder conviction and it probably won't be her last . . .<br /><br />This camera was my first digital camera and I used the heck out of it! At last count I have taken over 200,000 pictures. I used it for an online buisness and for personal family use. I bought it refurbished so I expected it to have problems from the get-go, but it was great up until it's early demise.<br /><br />The amazing unique feature on this camera was the tilting lense feature. I can't tell you how many times I used it. The camera was also very easy to use and understand, especially for the beginner - like I was. The battery life was Okay, it usually died on me after about 100 shots.<br /><br />The flaws on this camera are common flaws seen in any digicam this size. The lense is really small so low light or indoor pictures are awful. I missed a lot of adorable shots of my children indoors because of this issue. Red Eye is awful as well. The outdoor full sun pictures were really nice though, some of them positively stunning.<br /><br />Since I use my camera indoors mainly I decided to go with a camera twice as expensive this time around. One with a big lense!","I have had this camera for a year and a 1/2, and I still find it a great camera for casual photos.<br /><br />I love the swinging lense-it keeps the lense covered well when not in use, and you can take self-portraits very easy. I also like that you can angle up/down for awkward shots. Extreme closeups are sharp, but you have to fool around to guess where the focal point is. I haven't even played with the video clip part. I do like that you can make small images as you go. The Nikon software was mediocre. I stopped using it. Too bad they didn't continue with this design.<br /><br />I decided to write this review after looking at similar cameras this past holiday season. While it sucks at indoor pictures (dark and RED)unless there is A LOT of light (the triple flash is obnoxious), it generally delivers. It took better shots of fireworks than my friend's newer camera. [...]<br /><br />It's holding up very well to being tossed about in my bag, even without a case. The batteries don't charge as well as they did, but it's still usable. It uses Compact Flash, which I feel is better media than the starting-to-fade-away SD or MMC.<br /><br />If you see it at a good price, go for it. I paid $150 for it and a case and more memory. Should be a lot cheaper now.","ok, I'm a casual user, I don't take pictures too much, I don't go on trips alot and I don't print.  Now, I have had this camera for a long time so I can tell with certainty that I have not even thought of buying another camera to replace it.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />looks so much better than other cameras.<br /><br />you can adjust the angle of the lens, that gives you a lot of freedom to take pictures yourself, without asking strangers for help, which you don't know how it will turn out.<br /><br />Great value since it's very inexpensive now.<br /><br />Still work just the same as the first day I got it, at least a year now.<br /><br />The auto-scene mode is a must for novice users.<br /><br />Easy to use, not filled with a bunch of feature that a novice like myself would never use.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />2MP is too low by the standards today.<br /><br />Can't take moving pictures under bad lighting (few cameras can, though).<br /><br />if you aren't crazy about photos, this one will suit you fine and save you money.  I saw it on sale at WhoSave coom, a site that lists sales from Amazon and other places on the web, but that was awhile ago.  I am not sure if you can still buy this camera new.  Either way, I put in a recommendation for Nikon products.","I have had this little thing as my emergency camera for the last three years, I got it when it was released in the UK. I have found it to be an excellent little thing - remember, it is for snapshots.  I never use the flash as it bleaches the picture...by 'night scene' enables you to take some excellent pictures. Of course, by increasing aperture time one needs to steady the camera, therefore I have a little tripod that fits in a pocket - or I wedge the thing against something solid. I have an amazing array of pictures from it...and have had some win prizes and sold others. So, all those of you who are knocking the camera...I suggest you look at yourselves before blaming your tools!","I absolutely adored this camera! It was my first digital camera, and I took over 2,000 picures with it during the time it lasted, however it has now died completely (won't turn on most of the time and when it does the screen reads \"Error\") and I have only had it for about a year and a half. So, now I have to look for a new camera.","I'd like to point out to the reviewer who stated \"It Ain't that simple to use\" two things.............<br />#1 -- the camera is ultra simple to use<br />#2 -- ain't is not a word","Most of the comments here have already covered this great beginner's digicam in plenty of detail, so I thought I'd hit on one thing specifically: why the swivel lens is actually quite practical.  Besides allowing goofy but well-framed self-portraits ;), it's best used in situations where one needs extra height in order to take a shot. For example: I was recently part of a large crowd of people at a Thanksgiving Day parade.  I swiveled the lens *down*, held the camera above my head, and angled the LCD screen toward myself.  That let me view the framed shot clearly, and allowed me to take several photos *above the crowd* that would have been impossible to take otherwise.  Brilliant!","This is my first serious purchase of a digital camera. I like it very much, espcially the rotatiing lense. I am not pleased with the battery. Never has stayed charged for very long. I wonder if battery is defective. Will buy another battery very soon.","Overall, a decent camera.  Great function for size.  Price has come down quite a bit recently, so a good deal for the money.<br />Pros:<br />Size -- nice and compact, fits in my pocket.<br />No junk to tote around -- doesn't need a lens cap or other stuff that comes off and gets lost since it folds up.<br />3x optical zoom -- especially in such a small camera.<br />Close and tight macro.<br />Lots of Scene selections available that work well (outdoor, indoor, macro, indoors no flash, night, landscape, portrait, sports, etc.)<br />Takes CF cards -- which are not too expensive and available locally.<br />No trouble with compatibility on multiple computers.<br />Good sharp details/colors come out good most of the time (see below about white balance)<br />Simple menus that are easy to use.<br />Cons:<br />Expensive battery/charger -- oddball proprietary size.  Try to buy one of those batteries at the local WalMart or camera store.... No dice.<br />Needs a few more manual controls:<br />Ability to manual focus<br />White balance options when using scene selections,<br />Flash power control -- sometimes the flash blows out details on shiny things up close.<br />Hand-shake can be a problem up close when not using flash (because of reason listed above.)<br />No focus indicator crosshairs or little box in the display to show you what the camera is focusing on.","I purchased my camera 11 months ago when it first came out.. I  have never used a digital camera and was looking for an easy one,but good pictures. I loved the design.. and the  pictures are outstanding. My problem is no view finder. I have to take mystery pictures ,as I call them. I think it would be my dream camera if everything was the same but included a view finder..  I did buy the hood  for the viewing screen, but dosent help. I have to  wave my hand in front the  the lens to see if the camera is on after it automatically shuts down power.  Ok  thats it..  If the  view finder was on this camera it would be 6 stars in my rating book","This is an excellent camera for beginners. After a lot of research I made the choice to purchase this camera. The picture quality is excellent, even at night, and it's very simple to use. The scene modes are great, you can select different flash modes (no flash, auto, red-eye reduction), and one click upload is fast, the size and quality of pictures are very easy to adjust on the camera. The swivel lens is ok if you think you would like it. It also comes with rechargeable battery and charger (which many cameras in this class don't). The battery had pretty good life and can be fully charged in a couple hours. The optical zoom is also 3X which is better than most in its class. The USB upload is quick and easy. I haven't messed around the manual features so I don't know how well they work. My only gripes are the time from picture to picture can be slow, the flash produces bad red-eye, and the LCD screen can be hard to view in bright sunlight. Also I recommend getting the upgraded memory card to at least 128MB and the camera case for protection.","I like the swivel lens, good for candid photos.<br />Could use a longer zoom.","This camera is really neat with it's features, and being small its more versatile.  Takes great pictures up close, and beautiful ones from far away. Works well and efficently.","The camera take very nice pictures.  And the memory card that comes with it is fairly adequate.  I have two major complaints about the camera however, and I wouldn't have bought this camera if I'd know about these things...<br />Firstly, unless the camera is 'off' the battery gets wasted VERY quickly (like 1hr)!  It doesn't turn off automatically.  So, if you take a picture or download your pictures (the camera has to be 'ON' to download pics) and forget to turn the camera 'OFF', when you go to take pictures, the battery is totally dead.  This has happened to me many times.  Also, the slide level which is the 'ON-OFF-PLAY' control can easily slide into the 'ON' position without your knowing it if it's in a pocket or purse.<br />Secondly, it's very difficult to take indoor pictures of people.  I have tried several different 'scenes', nothing seems to help.  You have to hold the camera VERY steady in order to not get a blurry pic.<br />Maybe some of the higher priced Nikons are better.","I'm not a gadget freak but when I asked my parents for a digital camera for Christmas I made sure they knew I wanted something top of the line yet easy to use.  That about sums up this camera.  There are about 20 different fuctions to customize the type of picture you want to take including portrait and nightscapes which makes taking consistantly beautiful pictures a possibility for photography novices.<br />  Coupled with this is the beautiful and sleek design.  It's really nifty and I've gotten so many comments on how beautiful it is.  The fact that the lens slides around into the camera also keeps your lens protected.<br />The only cons I can think of are that I wish the battery lasted longer (it ran out in the middle of my African Safari at disney this jan) and that the neck strap is too long and not very functional.  I usually carry it in my pocket.","I received the Nikon Coolpix 2500 as a gift, and had I known that it was going to be purchased for me, I would have chipped in an extra $... to get myself a really nice camera. The 2500 is fine for amateurish photography, but I find it lacking when I want to be a little more creative with my photography.<br />Pictures that use the flash, no matter what special scene setting is used, come out too pale and whitewashed. Additionally, red-eye is a MAJOR problem with this camera, and the proximity of the flash to the lens creates a series of mysterious light \"bubbles\" on the pictures.<br />The scene selections are nice, but often incorrectly labeled. I find myself using the Backlight setting for pictures that aren't backlight, and the Snow/Beach setting for the pictures that are neither snowy nor at the beach.<br />Also, the LCD is easily scratched, and the small pixel count on it makes your pictures look much nicer than they are. Nothing is more frustrating that snapping a picture, okaying it via the LCD screen, and then finding it to be awful upon uploading. On the topic of the LCD screen, there is no option to turn off the screen because it has no viewfinder, which is a major drain on the battery life on the camera.<br />On the upside, the software the comes with the camera is nice and the swivel lens is handy for getting pictures at angles that you normally would be unable to see. If you purchase this camera, definately consider purchasing three other things: a more managable necklace, a much larger memory card (at least 64 mb) and an extra battery for long trips.","I own a Nikon Coolpix 995 but wanted something smaller for occasions where I didn't want to be bogged down with a large camera.  Except for the difference in resolution this little guy can go toe to toe with the 995 and even win in some cases.  The \"sunset mode\" made possible a professional looking shot of Big Ben in London at night that I have never been able to accomplish with the 995.  This one blows up to 7 X 11 easily and hangs on my wall beside a huge 16X20 night shot of Big Ben that was taken by my film SLR.  No one can tell the smaller one is digital!","It is a very good little camera to stow away in your bag but I would not recommend it for flash photography or to get a good close-up. THe red-eye reduction is just not there and the flash is less than desirable.","This camera is fantastic! This camera takes great pictures. I still can't believe the quality and detail that this camera produces. Every article you read says you can't make 8x10 prints from 2mp cameras. This one proves that wrong. I have made large prints with the crispness and clarity of smaller ones.<br />Fantastic camera. If you just want a fun digital camera with a ton of features this is the one to get.<br />I took off 1/2 a star because I would like a traditional viewfinder. You only have the display on the back.","...by far the best camera that I could get for a 2MP and that price range. I've had the camera a few months now, and I think it's wonderful! The pictures are so clear and the camera is really easy to use- the photo software it comes with is a great way for me to store all of my pictures on my laptop! I'm traveling this summer to Australia for 3 weeks, and I can't wait to get there and use this camera! I've already taken it on a lot of trips, and it has really worked!!<br />It's so easy to travel with because the camera can fit right in my purse!! I take my camera just about everywhere with me. It's small, light weight, and also really cute too!! the swivel feature is great because (I'm short) so if I hold the camera over a crowd and point it down, I still get good pictures! Also, when I point the swivel back, I can take self-portraits of me and my friends when no one else is around to take our picture! the self-timer is also really handy, too! The \"scene\" button helps a lot when you take pictures in different atmospheres and lighting!<br />This is a great camera and you can't go wrong with it! ...it works perfect for me, and my parents love this camera too!! It's really a good camera for people of any ages to use! It's really easy to learn to use and always takes GREAT pictures!","I'm quite happy with my Nikon Coolpix 2500. It's cute, small and easy to use for a first time digital camera user, such as myself.<br />I've been using it for a couple months now to take pictures of just abot everything and overall, it takes some really great pictures. Although, lighting is a big factor for a picture to turn out well, without the orange glow that seems to be quite common from this camera. Any slight movement, such as a small hand twitch, can really the image.<br />Be sure to have Windows 98 SECOND EDITION or higher. It didn't say that anywhere when I bought it, and sadly I only have Win98. Thank goodness it's compatible with a Mac or I wouldn't be able to use it.<br />In a nutshell, it takes good pictures with good lighting. The 20 second movie capability could be a bit better, but it works and is great for spur of the movement fun. Lots of different settings to use in different conditions: portrait, landscape, fireworks, close up, sunset, party/indoor, night time, night landscape, back light, museum, beach/snow.<br />Worth the money.","This isn't my first digital camera, but I am certainly no expert.<br />To be honest, I bought a Canon S-45, but it was WAY more than I need for school photos of my middle schoolers. I had school funds, so I went to Wal Mart, and got this 2-mega pixel (really cool!) camera for $297.<br />My first impression was that it was tad expensive for a 2 mega pixel, but on school $$$, who cares? My second impression was \"there's no viewfinder!\". But the bright LCD is great (you can increase the brightness too!), and after the initial 'getting used to it', I have never missed the viewfinder!<br />OK--here's the scoop. First the POSITIVES:<br />1. It is small, SLEEK, and ultra-cool style-wise. GREAT here!!!!!<br />2. The images touched up just a bit in photo-editing software, FAR exceeded my expectations for a 2-mega pixel camera! I had them printed at Wal Mart in a half-hour for 30 cents each, and they are BETTER than my 35 mm photos (at 4X6 or smaller in FINE mode).<br />3. The swivel lens is cool and sharp!! (Though I'm not sure how necessary). It does protect the lens, but you WILL smudge it OFTEN!!<br />4. The one touch transfer from camera to computer is easy (can you say EASY?)!<br />5. The lithium battery (in its charger) lasts me all day with no problem!<br />6. The twelve scene modes cover just about any shooting situation you could imagine--as does plain ol' automatic. The close-up mode focuses down to 2 inches--I practiced on a salt packet at McDonalds!!<br />7. Nikon really IS more than just the name. They provide everything you need including the USB cable. I would upgrade the CF card, though, to 64 or 128 MB. A quality camera.<br />8. It comes with an OK manual, and is reasonably easy to learn.<br />And now for the NOT so positives:<br />1. The cool case is sturdy, but will scratch if bumped hard. Not a biggie here.<br />2. The flash washes out the picture when you get TOO close, (forgivable), and is worthless altogether beyond about 10 feet (not forgivable).<br />3. The buttons are a  bit small, so good eyes are required.<br />4. You get no sound in your 15 seconds of 'movie', but this isn?t great to start with. Get a camcorder!<br />5. The 3x optical zoom is great, but the 4x digital zoom increases the graininess--true in all cameras not just this one.<br />Bottom line:<br />Am I satisfied with this camera at $297 of school $$$? You bet!! It is all any teacher would need, and 60% of the human race too. Would I pay MY $$$ for it? Nope. I'd pay a little more for a 3-4 mega pixel. This camera does everything it is SUPPOSED to, WELL!<br />The pictures are OUTSTANDING!!<br />This is a FUN, cool, QUALITY, and slightly overpriced digital camera, that understanding these attributes, you will enjoy if you buy it!","0. I had to return my new Pentax 430rs (4 Megapixel Ultra-Compact) because of the unexceptable level of digital color noise, very poor focusing system, light sensitivity (esp. at max resolution) and unnatural looking colors. Now I feel mutch happier with Coolpix 2500.<br />1. Professional picture quality provided by \"256 segment exposure metering\" system, \"noise reduction\" system, fantastic light sensitivity (\"ISO400\" auto-gain works - pure pleasure).<br />2. White balance is excellent.<br />3. No digital noise visible at 100% size picture (unlike most of the competitors).<br />4. Most definitely \"not a 1st time user camera\" (too many features, options), read few 1st time user reviews on this page - nonsensical comments. This is the camera for enthusiast or professional who wants to have a camera with him all the time (ultra-compact) and still get serious quality pictures.<br />5. Best value for $$$.<br />6. I hope Coolpix SQ will be even better Ultra-Copmact (not like 3500).","I've been living with this camera since last Sept. when I took it on a month-long trip to NYC and Europe.  I come from a 35mm SLR background (two college photography classes).  I've been waiting for Nikon to create a form factor that utilized much of the features of their higher end cameras, but more compact.  This camera is perfect in that regard, so I made the plunge into digital.<br /><br />I've taken over 1000 photos with this camera and overall I'm very happy with it.  I don't have much to add to what others have posted, but I'll point out what I consider a major design flaw:  the LCD screen used as a viewfinder scratches VERY easily -- in the next iteration of this product, Nikon needs to add a sliding door to protect this LCD panel.  Even with a camera case, this thing will get scuffed up -- I liked to keep my camera at my ready, sometimes in a pocket or nylon bag with other solid objects -- if they rub against the LCD, forget it -- Scuff City.<br /><br />On a positive note, I wanted to point out something a lot of other reviewers have neglected to mention:  the ability to capture motion video in Quicktime format.  If you use digital editing software you can string these together, add a music track and make some cool little movies to post online or email friends and family  Very cool.  Wish the camera could capture sound, but I suppose that's not the market Nikon is addressing with the Coolpix.  It's still a very cool little extra you should explore if you buy this camera.<br /><br />Otherwise,  the menus -- once you've used them for a few days -- are quite intuitive and easy to access.  However, you should play around with the different presets as well as the manual exposure adjustment to get a feel for what kind of results you'll get.  The presets will probably fit most needs, but it's nice to be able to \"open\" and \"close\" the aperture for darker or lighter exposure  (okay, it's a CCD chip, not a mechanical lens and aperture!).<br /><br />One minor interface gripe:  I wish the camera remembered its last settings (like extra sharpening) between powering off and on.<br /><br />POST-SCRIPT JUNE 2005:<br /><br />So several years later I come back and find that I can't stand by what I originally wrote.  I still like the form factor of this camera, but generally agree with what many have said about terrible indoors photos and red-eye: I've tried every setting possible with this camera, but in darker indoor settings  I can NEVER get a clear shot with this camera.  So I'm looking to get a Canon PowerShot probably -- I've tried a friend's and it flat out performs better. By this time you shouldn't even be considering this camera since there are so many others that offer 3+ megapixel anyway.","We bought this camera when our baby was born and have been very happy with it.  The one drawback which has proven to be a challenge is that many, many photos we take have a significant red-eye problem.  I've been told that this happens often with babies and animals, but it seems to happen more with this camera than it does with others.<br />Overall, however, I would recommend the camera -- it's light, takes generally good photos and is in an affordable price range.","i wrote a review about this camera before but i forgot to<br />write a big disadvantage which is:<br />WHEN LIGHT IS POOR THE CAMERA CAN NOT FOCUS!!!<br />THERE IS NO INFRA-RED SENSOR IN THE CAMERA OR A BUILT-IN LIGHT FOR THE CAMREA TO FOCUS IN POOR LIGHT CONDITIONS ( THIS OPTION IS AVAILABLE IN SONY CAMERAS)<br />NOTE : MY PREVIOUS REVIEW TITLE WAS (i love it) please read it i think it is helpful","advantages:<br />- brand name<br />- nice looking<br />- excellent print results for 10cm*15cm , very good 21cm*15cm prints<br />- great picture quality (compared to any other 2MP camera and even to 3MP cameras)<br />- the swivel lens is a very helpful and protects the lens when not in use<br />- fits easily in your pocket<br />- very easy to use (does not have many manual settings ; great for beginners)<br />- best shoot selector is a very good option<br />- u can choose from 12 scenes ( useful option)<br />- the quick button lets u see the picture you shot without having to change the mode<br />disadvantages:<br />- any person who holds the camera even for just a second will put his finger on the lens<br />- does NOT have optical finder (i think it is not important ; my friends have optical finders in their cameras and they never use it)<br />- the quality of the view you see in the LCD before shooting is bad ; you can feel it very much when you use a SONY )<br />- u can NOT resize the photo after shooting (this would have been very helpful when there is no disk space in your camera so u can choose the least important photos and change them to less resolution to have space for more photos)<br />- u can not view the photos on a TV<br />- i do NOT like the supplied software (nikon view 5); it is easier to download the pictures by making your computer see the camera as a removable disk<br />- the video is limited by 15 seconds each , and it does NOT record audio ( anyway it is a still camera not a video camera)<br />- i had some problems using the macro (close up) mode ; it was very difficult to set the focus<br />comments:<br />- if u really need to display your photos on a TV and u can't wait till u go home and view them on your desktop PC do not buy this product , OTHERWISE GO AND BUY IT NOW !!<br /><br />NOTE :if u need better quality prints for larger size prints(larger than 21cm*15cm) and u can spend some more money , buy the coolpix 3500 it has exactly the same features for coolpix 2500 except for the resolutin which is 3.2MP instead of 2MP","This camera is extremely portable and durable, and it takes beautiful photos in most situations.<br />In two months of using mine as a snappy, I have found only three consistent problems:<br />1)  The shutter release is slow compared to film cameras, so you have to be patient when taking photos.  Hold the camera still until it's done, or it will take blurry pictures.  The slowness also means that you have to anticipate action shots, such as a child in motion, or you'll miss the subject.  (This is true mainly when the subject is within a couple of yards.  It's fine with longshots.)<br />2) The flash unit really does create some nasty red-eye.<br />3) It takes practice to use the swivel lens.  Early on, you might miss some great shots because you're fumbling with it.<br />Despite these problems, I have grown to appreciate the Nikon 2500's simplicity and excellent optics.  I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a low-profile camera that delivers great results.<br />(NOTE FOR THE COST-CONSCIOUS: Make sure to include the cost of a larger (64-128 megabyte) compact flash memory card in your product comparison.  The card sold with this camera and most digital cameras holds very few photos at maximum resolution.)","We decided to purchase this camera because of it's size and weight; we thought, if it's small and light we won't mind actualy carrying it around and using it.  We have been VERY pleased with this camera, however, you cannot rely solely on it's automatic settings.  If you take time to experiment a little and learn the camera's features you'll get great shots (clear, sharp, colorful) almost every time.<br />We used this camera in France to take over 1,200 photos (on 3 or 4 cards).<br />We had Kodak prints made of our favorite 250 shots from online, using iPhoto.  Everyone who has viewed our pictures has expressed how sharp, clear, and colorful the photography is.  One of the best photos was taken from the Eiffel tower at dusk.  We did have to hold the camera very steady and manually adjust the settings, but the color and sharpness is superb - the blue sky fading to black, the moon, the reflections in the Sein, the city and lights - all crisp as could be and good color too.<br />We also had very good luck in museums with low-light and no flash.  Again, you will need to manually set the camera and hold it quite steady - or rest it on a rail.<br />The swivel lens is a feature in itself and allows you to take stealth photos - over your shoulder, for example - as well as protecting the lens.  You can get great candid shots, which are usually the best ones.<br />While the battery does well, if you plan to use it a lot (like on a vacation) I strongly recommend purchasing an additional, larger FlashCard and extra battery.  We took three of each to France with us.<br />I'd absolutely reocommend this camera.","I've had this camera about a month and I have been very pleased with it.  There is a CD and manual that walks you through set-up and use, which you will need if you never owned a digital camera before.  It was a cinch to connect and set-up on my computer.  No additional drivers were needed, although I run Windows ME on my system.  The picture quality is excellent.  The size is nice and compact too, which was important to me.  I compared this model with several other ones and ended up choosing it because of the Nikon reputation.  I have not been disappointed.  I only rated it 4 stars because of the amount of effort I had to put into learning all the features before I could start shooting pictures.  It is not a shoot and go camera, but it was not hard to understand the directions, only time consuming.","Easy to use and great as a first digital camera.  Good quality pictures on fine setting.  Only downfall is lack of through the lens view finder.  LCD screen is hard to view in sunshine.","I bought the 2500 as a point & shoot for work and light/fast travel, to let my son learn photography without running up a huge film tab, because I've been impressed with a different Coolpix I use at work, because it received special mention in a recent CU test despite not being top rated, and based on consistently strong web review.<br />Let me preface my comments with a recommendation/requirement:  read the manual carefully cover-to-cover, practice to become facile with the many functions, and take the time to understand how each \"scene\" makes the camera behave.  Sometimes the \"scenes\" are useful for more than their intended purpose.  Skip this step and it's just a point & shoot.  Take a few hours to figure it out and you can capture great images in most shooting situations.  Nikon has worked very hard to provide quick access to the full range of functions through a small set of controls.<br />Man, was I in for a surprise after getting this camera!  My aging but beloved SLR gear will get very little use in the future.  We shot several hundred images over the Christmas/New Year break, most of which was spent sightseeing in DC.  Indoors & out.  Day & night.  Museums, fireworks shows, parties, set shots, grab shots, painting with light on street corners at night, riding the Metro, and so on.  The images are sharp, vivid and true to color, and distortion-free.  I can't remember ever coming home from a trip with a better set of images.<br />There have been plenty of thorough reviews of this camera, so I'll just tick off a few things I find special about it:<br />--  IMHO it is the most pocketable/capable digital camera on the market today.  Some are smaller, but they don't have the 2500's capabilities.<br />--  The Best Shot Selector is an amazing and vital feature.  You can capture hassle-free and surprisingly crisp images at night and in flash-prohibited museums.<br />--  The rotating lens is a major plus.  Excellent lens protection with no cap to lose.  The 1.2\" camera thickness (lens stowed) is a lot easier on the pocket than the 1.5\" standard digital camera thickness.  In a crowd?  Tilt the lens 45 degrees down and hold the camera overhead.  Working a camera-shy crowd?  Tilt the lens 45 degrees up and shoot with the camera in your lap.  People think you're scrolling through stored images instead of shooting new ones.  Unlike some previous reviewers, I have no problem deploying the lens and keeping my fingers off it.<br />--  The white adjustment feature is very useful and powerful.  White correction is a common post-shoot task, and a sad one since it sucks color and range out of the image.  The 2500's white adjustment takes care of that.  Add the 2500's exposure control and you can land images that are ready to be printed and framed.<br />No honest review can be gripe-free, so these are mine:<br />--  Yes, there are a limited number of times when a conventional viewfinder would be handy.  IMO those few times wouldn't be worth the added bulk and cost.  Nikon, if you're listening, stick with the current design.<br />--  I would like a faster minimum shutter speed on the \"party/indoor\" scene.  This would lose a little background and make the flash more evident, but would produce many more sharp images.<br />Thanks for reading, if you made it this far.  I highly recommend the Coolpix 2500.  The strongest testimonial might come from my wife, who was shocked at the images when I printed a few test sheets.  She's practically stopping strangers on the street and telling them to buy this camera.","I got this camera for my birthday a few months ago, and since then I've used it a lot. I hardly ever take my videocamera out anymore, since it's more fun to take digital pictures and put them on the computer, and send e-mails, and whatnot.<br />The images are crisp and clean. I'm really an amateur when it comes to photography, so I don't know enough to say how technically good it is, but for family pictures at Disneyland it's just fine.<br />Instead of looking through a tiny eye hole, you have to look at the viewscreen to get your shot, and that took some getting used to, though now it's no big deal. Also, since the flash is so close to the lens I get lots of red eye in the pictures all the time. I know I can edit out the red eye with the software, but it would be nice to not have the red eye there. Also, it's very hard to take pictures at night, or with little light. I can turn off the flash, but then the shutter opens up so much that I can't keep my hands still enough to avoid blurry pictures. So I don't have many pictures from the nighttime soccer games I like.<br />I'd recommend the camera for someone who is just getting in to digital photography and wants to create nice pictures for a website or sharing through e-mail. I like how the lens can swivel around, allowing me to hold the camera above my head, or waist high, and get more interesting pictures.","I am extrememly impressed with the ease of use and the wealth of features in such a small camera.  The swiveling lens is ingenious.  The instructions are very clear and simple, especially the instructional video CD that makes even the novice user comfortable with using a digital camera for the first time.<br />The 15 second movie mode is fun as well!","I bought this camera for a vacation to Europe and overall, I had a good experience with the camera. It was lightweight, compact and easily fit in various pockets. When I came home, I found the photos of scenes in the outdoors with decent natural sunlight came out fine. Outdoor night photos results were typical for digital cameras - usually a little blurry (I think this is because the auto exposure keeps the shutter open longer to capture more light, but the tradeoff is blur).<br />I was disappointed by the quality of indoor photos where the Nikon flash was used. I found most of the indoor photos with flash had annoying \"flash spots\" that seem to be a result of unwanted reflections. Another small annoyance was the battery-life - I seem to need to recharge after 200 or so shots.<br />I'd recommend this Nikon as a reasonable \"second\" digital camera for travel or situations where a bulkier camera is not suitable, especially if most of the photos are outdoor daylight scenes.","Like most Nikon digitals, this camera offers excellent image quality.  A good zoom, excellent macro mode, and pretty good ease of use.  However, I think the design is awful.<br />For starters, the swiveling lens.  Due to the design, people have a tendency to put their fingers all over the lens while swiveling it.  Also, tilt it up too far and you'll be taking a picture of the plastic housing of the camera--oops!  Perhaps the biggest design flaw in this camera is lack of a viewfinder.  I guess depending on your situation it may not matter, however if you live where I live (bright, SUNNY Florida) and you take pictures outside, that LCD screen is virtually useless.  It gets washed out, you're not going to be able to see what you're doing, and you'll wish you had bought a camera that has an optical viewfinder.  I don't understand how Nikon could have omitted that from a camera.<br />The only real advantage this camera has over competing manufacturers' cameras is the macro mode.  Nikon is tough to beat in that respect.  That aside, look at a Canon Elph if you're looking for a small camera.  The image quality is just as good, you still get a zoom, and you get an optical viewfinder.","I'll get one thing out of the way. I bought this camera mainly because it looked cool. I was shopping for a digital camera in an electronics market (I live in Asia) and was looking for something in the 2.0 megapixel range. I ran across the CoolPix 2500 and the design of it definitely caught my eye. I looked at it for a while, toyed around and decided I wanted to buy it. While it's definitely a good camera, it's not the best.<br />On the whole, I thought this camera was pretty good. One thing that sets the Nikon CoolPix line of cameras apart from everything else is its swivel lens design. This is clever because when you're not using it, it covers the lens. No need to worry about broken lens covers or scratched lenses anymore. Plus it helps getting angled shots much easier. No more craning your neck to get a shot above of below you, just tilt the lens. It's a whole lot more useful than you'd think.<br />The picture quality of this in general is pretty good. The colors come out accurately and the pictures are clear. However, the night exposure could be better, although it's good enough to pass without any qualms. A big problem that's related to night time shots however is red eye. It's always there and it never seems to go away. I managed to minimize it using the different scene settings, but it just never completely leaves. It gets sort of annoying after a while, but it's something most people can live with.<br />Also, the camera tends to feel on the fragile side. Whenever I put it in my pocket, I always feel like it's going to break any second. Of course it's never happened and I realize that it'll take quite a bit to knock it out of commission, but it does have that light easily breakable feeling that I can never seem to shrug off.<br />Some other minor complaints is that there is no video output straight to a TV and there is no optical viewfinder, although the optical viewfinder part isn't really too big of a problem. Also, there is no protection for the LCD screen. Something along the lines of what Sony does with their cameras would have been a good protective measure to take with the screen.<br />With all these negative aspects to it, you would think that I wouldn't like it, but that isn't the case. It still is a good camera and it's a blast to use. The visual quality is still fairly good and has a bunch of nifty features to it, namely the swivel lens. And besides, whenever you pull it out in front of other people and you swing the lens, everyone will go \"ooohhhhhh.\"","I researched several cameras, including the Canon PowerShot and greater and lesser Nikon Coolpix, before deciding on the Coolpix 2500.<br />Things I like about it:<br />1. The size is great. I carry it in my purse or around my neck at all times. You can't get the shot unless the camera is with you! This is one camera you CAN have with you all the time. The swivel lens helps make it more compact because there are no protruding parts once you close the lens, no lens cap to worry about, and the lens is totally protected. I slide mine in an inexpensive zippered makeup bag and throw the strap around my neck. Wha-la! - instant [inexpensive] camera bag.<br />2. The quality of the pictures is amazing! The resolution is fantastic, much better than I needed or expected. It does a good job in low light situations too, which was something I was looking for.<br />3. Scene modes: These are very useful for someone like me who wants to be creative and get good shots, but doesn't have the time or patience to figure out the correct shutter speed and what-not.<br />I don't have any negatives that are bad enough that I would take the camera back, but just so you know...<br />Things I don't like:<br />1. People have complained that the flash is too bright. For this reason, I usually rely on natural lighting when photographing people. Fortunately, the camera is usually able to handle this. You have to hold it steady because the shutter speed is slower. I'm usually able to get one that is clear if I snap several. The nice thing is that it is digital, so you can see what you are getting, and retake if necessary.<br />2. Buy a 128 MB or at least 64 MB memery card the same day you buy the camera. I have not even messed with the starter card they give you. Way too small.<br />3. This is just an oddity, not really a problem. When you are in close-up mode, the lens is constantly refocusing and/or resetting the lighting, not quite sure. Consequently, it makes a lot of clicking and buzzing sounds. Not so great if you are trying to sneak up on a butterfly or something. Hasn't really bothered me, except that I thought my camera was broken. I decided it wasn't when my replacement camera did the same thing.<br />4. If you can afford it, buy a second battery. It lasts a decent amount of time, but it would be nice to have an extra.<br />So, these are minor problems, with solutions. I'm very pleased with the camera. It's great to have a digital. My photographic skills have improved just by buying this camera because 1. I can take as many pictures as I want, without worrying about wasting film 2. I can re-take until I get the shot. 3. I always have it with me, so I rarely miss that awesome photo-op. 4. It's a Nikon!","I really liked the small size, swivel lens and general ease of use.Because the lens swivels inwards when the camera is not in use, and in zoom mode the lens is still in the camera body, it is virtually indestructible. My cat grabbed the wrist strap and dropped the camera onto a cement floor from a 5' height and it didn't hurt it one bit. HOWEVER, I am sorry it has no viewfinder. In bright sunlight it is very hard to see the LCD screen. Also unlike a regualr camera, if longsighted you will have to put your reading glasses on to see the display!<br />Dowloading to the PC is a snap, and the software was easy to use.","As a geologist I have used the Nikon coolpix 2500 almost exclusively during fieldwork in the Betic COrdillerea in Spain, the Bristol Channel in Britain and in  the Swiss alps. My previous bulky Canon served me well, but it is all so much easier with the coolpix 2500. This small robust camara fits easily in a small hip pocket it is readily accessable and one does not even feel its presence. I have used it for documenting details of rocks as well as for panorama's. Especially the panorama feature is powerful. Often it is not possible to stand far enough away to fotograph a geological scene, with the panorama feature it is very easy to make a seemless overview. Teaching in fieldtrips for students and professionals, I can now in the evening give an overview of the day. Critical engineers have complemented me on the quality of the foto's on the screen in the evening of the same excursion day. Everyone was amazed about the sharpness of the 2 MP images. The camara is beautifully compatible with my Macintosh Titanium laptop. The comby with a small beamer ensures a quick high quality fotoshow in the evening of a days fieldwork. It has improved my teaching and ensured high customer satisfaction.<br />Documenting fieldwork foto's is quick and easy with the software that is provieded with the camara (how did I ever manage without?).<br />The camara is also amazingly sturdy. This was tested unintendedly when I slipped over a wet rock, fell and dropped the camara. It landed on pebbles from about 0.5m height but showed no sign of damage and has worked fine ever since (the lens was turned in the closed position).","I bought this camera a few months ago, and I've come across both good and bad features since using it.<br />This is a 2MP digital camera that comes with about 12 scenic features - including portraits, landscape, sunset, close up, indoor, fireworks (though I've never used it ..), backlight, night portaits/lanscape, etc. It has a LCD moniter, swivel lens, self-timer; and I believe a video option but I would never recommend using it.<br />It's an easy one-touch upload. You simply attach the camera to the provided USB, go into the program and hit \"transfer\" and you're all done.<br />The Negative:<br />It contains no veiwfinder, only a LCD moniter. In bright light, such as sunlight, it's practically imposssible to know what you're taking a picture of!<br />Also, forget about taking any action shots. Unless you're planning on taking still-life pictures, I wouldn't recommend it. All of my pictures where something is moving, even in the slightest, such as somebody walking, the picture is blurry.<br />And for some reason, pictures taken at night or in the dark come out bad. The flash sometimes makes the subject look very bright, while the background is very dark, and I've had some weird spots show up on my pictures before, due to dusty conditions or something.<br />The camera comes with an 8MB card, which only holds about 15 pictures taken in the best settings (Fine, 1600 x 1200). If you're planning on taking lots of pictures in an extended amount of time, I would recommend buying another card, preferably one that is bigger than 8MB.<br />The Positive:<br />It's lightweight and easy to carry. I've kept it in my pocket, or in my purse, and it is comfortable and convienent.<br />The pictures come out good, as far as I know. This is my first camera, so I can't really compare. I had no problem understanding the manual. It was simple and direct, and I liked the easy features.<br />The best thing about this camera is the swivel lens! It allows for cool angles and is terrific for self-portraits.<br />Overall:<br />It's been a pleasure using the Nikon Coolpix 2500. I'm a beginner to photography and had no problem mastering this camera's features. I bring this camera everywhere, it's so compatible and easy to carry. I love the slim design and the swivel lens, as well as the basic upload and quality of the pictures.<br />But it does have some problems that I mentioned. I wish they would have put in a veiwfinder, and the delay is about 2 1/3 seconds so any movement in pictures shows up as a blur. Those are my only real complaints, though.<br />I would recommend this camera to anybody who wants a fun, simple, easy-going camera and is planning on taking pictures of still-life.","I've been using the Coolpix 2500 for a few months now and I'm thrilled that I chose it.  Here's why:<br />- Fully compatible with a macintosh computer and iPhoto.  Just plug the camera into a free USB slot and turn it on to the view mode.<br />- Excelent picture quality (2MP).  Both printed (up to 8x10) as well as computer images are crisp clear and bright.<br />- Senic settings that actually work!  I've tried taking the same picture with each seprate pre-set and got different results.  Even better, the recomended setting was the best.<br />- Small, swivel lens (for protection and intesting angles), easy to see LCD monitor and price.<br />The only things I would improve are:<br />- Faster response time when turning the camera on<br />- Shorter pause between pictures.<br />For a point and shoot, I don't think you can do much better in this price range (especially if you're a mac user).","The Nikon Coolpix 2500 is a great camera. It may only be 2 megapixels, but unless you decide to print photos larger than 4x6, maybe even 8x10, then 2 MP is fine. I use this camera for web pictures and just showing pictures on a computer screen, so 2MP is more than enough.<br /><br />The camera comes with 12 scenic modes that you can choose from, or just choose either manual or automatic mode. The 12 scenic modes are for diffrent situations, like snow, indoor/party, portrait, nightscape, night portrait, and (one that still seems strange to me) fireworks. Basically, the scenic modes adjust the camera's setting to adapt it to work better in a certain situation. I find that I use manual the most, cause I like to play with settings. The auto mode works quite well too.<br />The LCD monitor is the only way to take pictures on the camera. Nikon, probably for lack of space and the design of the camera, decided that they wouldn't include a optical viewfinder. What does that mean? It makes it a little harder to take pictures in direct sunlight, but the LCD is still decently visible when compared to other LCDs, like my Nikon Coolpix 990.<br />And now, picture quality. Pictures on average, very good quality. On a computer screen, its difficult to notice the diffrence between my Coolpix 990, which has 3.34 MP, and the Coolpix 2500. I did notice a little \"noise\" when taking a picture in lowlight, especially on wooden color things, on the LCD, but they don't seem to show up in the final print. The optical zoom is very good, and the camera lets you know when you've started using the dreaded \"digital zoom\". The digital zoom produces a horrible amount of noise on the LCD. I recommend avoiding the digital zoom.<br />The size of the camera is one of the best parts of it. Its small enough to fit conviently in a cargo pocket or in the palm of your hand. The size doesn't detract from the feel of the camera though. My hands seem almost perfectly fitted to the camera, even though my hands are on the larger side. The styling of the body also stands out, and makes it prettier to look at then the usual boring camera.<br />When searching for a digital camera, I ended up with two finalists; the Coolpix 2500 and the Digital Elph s200. I chose the Coolpix in the end for a few reasons:<br />Price-The found the Coolpix at a much cheaper price on another website than I could find the Elph<br />Compactness-The Elph is about an inch shorter, but I was more worried about width than length.<br />Styling- I liked the look of the Coolpix more than the Elph.<br />And the final, biggest reason:<br />The swivel lens! This feature took the cake. Swivel lenses make getting shots so much easier, as well as allowing for more creativity. With the Swivel lens, you can shoot in almost any directiong without moving the main body of teh camera. Also, the swivel lens allows the lens to be protected with it is inside the body.<br />The coolpix 2500 is my favorite digital camera of the ones i've tried, including the Elph. Always research for yourself, though, as the best camera for one is the worst camera for another.","They call it 'point and click'.  Well, maybe that's true after you spend a day or two with the owner's manual.  Maybe all digital cameras are like this, but understanding all the options and setup is difficult for me.  Then, transferring the pictures to my pc and actually producing prints is not trivial (to me).<br />Someone else remarked that the LCD can't be read in the sun.  I wish I'd listened before I bought this camera.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to see.  The camera has no veiwfinder.  Nikon should have at least included the LCD hood with the camera.  And, AMAZON, should at least sell it!  I ordered one from another online retailer.  Maybe I should just return this hard to use toy?","I researched 2mp cameras for 2 months before settling on the 2500.  I was worried about it's lack of viewfinder and proprietary battery, but ultimately went for it because of the compactness, pic quality, and the swivel lense.<br />The camera itself is a bit big for the pocket, but I switched from a 35mm SLR, so it's much more mobile than I'm used to.  The batteries seem to last a long time, but I picked up a spare for peace of mind in long events.<br />My one big complaint before purchasing was it's lack of viewfinder, but the LCD is bright and clear even outside in the sunlight... the only problem situations are in dark bars/resturaunts.  I think Nikon could have moved the Flash to the part of the case were the red-eye light is and put a small viewfinder on the swivel lense.  I don't really miss the viewfinder now, however.  I find it much better to compose the shot using the LCD on most digicams because of parallax.<br />I was also wondering how it would fare in action shots without many of the manual controls I was used to, but after a big road race this weekend, I'm very pleased.  The shots were sharp and the color was very good... even on runners sprinting over the finish line.  The swivel lense was great for getting shots over the crowd on the sidelines.  I experimented with the continuous 16-shot, but found the quality sub-par... and was dissappointed that the Nikon software wouldn't automatically separate the shots out into 16 smaller individual images.<br />Overall, a great camera and great pictures from a small package that's easy to take along anywhere.","I purchased the Coolpix 2500 because of the compact size, the swivel lens, ease of use, how comfortable it is to hold, the attractive design, and the quality of the images.<br />But after four months of use, I have found drawbacks. It is difficult to see the display in daylight. Also, the auto-focus feature and shutter speed are slow, making it difficult to take decent pictures of a very mobile 11-month-old.<br />While this is a great point-and-shoot camera, it is best used for still shots.","Good pic quality, good looking but the LCD is very hard to see under daylight. A old fashion picture hole should added back to the camera.","Very good features, but there is NO viewfinder. This means you have to use the LCD screen to see what is in the cameras view. This does NOT work if either: 1) you take pictures outside which makes seeing the LCD very difficult; or 2) you need reading glasses, which I do. In this case, you need to put on the glasses to see what the camera sees and take them off to see what's going on around you. A big pain!","Let me just start off and say, This camera is everything you could want. I am a graphic designer, i own a Fuji S1 PRO digital camera and wanted a second durable more portable camera which i could take everywhere with me.<br />I was convicned with the Nikon 2500 mostly because of price and the fact that the image quality was great and plus it came with a rechargable battery.<br />There were only 2 things i was worried about and i am writing this review to clear this issue up.<br />1] Shooting speed is NOT slow<br />I read a lot of complaints about the shooting speed and I was worried that i would have to wait 2 seconds or more to take a picture. this is NOT TRUE. It takes pictures with practically no lag. You press the button it takes the picture. The people who complained about the speed might have been having problems focusing the image.<br />2] Colors come out Perfect<br />Some people mentioned a problem with the colors of the pictures. NOT TRUE. pictures look very realistic and are great quality.<br />these 2 issues were making me very insecure about the purchase. i was afraid this nikon would be a waste of money. I am now VERY glad i got this. Not only is the price incredibly [inexpensive] but in the end you are getting a NIKON!! So basically do not worry about anything when you get this camera. It will more then satify all your needs...","I bought this camera after reading a multitude of reviews on the internet, and I have to say it's lived up to my expectations.  The first thing you'll notice is its compact size, which means you'll conveniently be able to take it with you anywhere.  Despite it's small size, it's surprisingly easy to hold and use(and I have big hands).<br />The rotating camera lens is as useful as it is innovative.  It enables you to aim your camera without having to compromise your view of the LCD screen on the back.  Speaking of the LCD display, it's very bright and pleasing to look at.<br />Use of the camera is not tricky at all.  I found myself zipping through the various menus and settings with ease after only a few uses.  And I think you'll really appreciate the 12 different scene modes it has to offer (particular \"indoor\", \"close-up\", and \"museum\" mode).  I thought the different modes were just a marketing strategy, but I use them all the time!<br />Despite all this, the most important thing the camera has to offer is its clarity and ability to capture rich colors.  At 2 MP's, it produces pictures that are 1600x1200, which makes great 4x6 photos, and adequate 8x10's.  Since most of us can't print pictures larger than that, there's not much need to spend [money] more for a 3-4 MP camera.  For outdoor photos, the colors and sharpness of the images are outstanding.  Sometimes, pictures taken in dimly-lit settings tend to have more \"noise\" sometimes, so I'm still trying to find the right camera setting to compensate.  But of course, it's always harder to take good pictures in dimly-lit environments, despite what camera you use.<br />Another nice feature is the ability to capture up to 15 seconds of video.  My only gripes:  why the 15 second limit? and why not the ability to capture sound?<br />Finally, the battery:  trust me, you'll appreciate not having to use 4 AA batteries (which drain quickly and add lots of weight to a camera).  The rechargeable battery is small, light, and lasts surprisingly long.  Charging only takes 2 hrs (about the time it takes for me to upload pictures and play around with them anyways!).<br />With all this in mind, I can say that for this price, the camera is a great deal.  Throw in the 3x optical zoom and a 16 MB starter card along with all the features I mentioned above, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a similar camera that costs less than [$$$]!","I recently purchased this camera along with a viking 128mb card and a simpletech reader. I have not had problems with anything. The camera works nicely and once you get used to it, you can open it with out touching the lense. The problem I read about with the lag, I have not seen it. Like a regular camera that has to focus before shooting, this camera has to do the same thing. You can focus the camera then take a picture, no lag.<br />  I am also running windows 2000, I haven't had any problems with any software from the camera or the reader. I did not have to install anything for the reader, just plug it in. Everything works like a charm. I love the camera and the reader. The card works great with the nikon, no problems there.<br />  I hope I helped answer some of the question that previous reviews raised. This is a great camera, small, lite, compact, fun and easy to use. If you get one, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading my rambling.","Really nice camera for a low price.  In fact Amazon might want to double check their price, Best Buy now has it for $248!","This is my first digital camera, and it's been great so far.  It's not quite film quality, but it's fun.  The swivel design, movie mode, and adequate included storage make it easy to capture much more of an event than traditional film cameras. The included 16-meg compactflash card is fairly big, holding anywhere from about 15 to over 200 pictures, depending on the size and compression options which are accessed through an intuitive menu system.<br />The design of the camera is very smooth--when the lens is rotated back into the body, there are no protrusions, making it nice for carrying in a pocket.<br />As others have noted, the lag time before the camera actually takes the picture can be annoying, but choosing the right \"scene\" (a preset of various camera settings) or using a tripod eliminate much of the problem.  The \"Museum\" scene is pretty impressive, and does a good job of capturing vivid colors in indoor situations without the use of the flash.<br />All in all, it's a great camera.  It manages to retain some of the high-end features found in the more expensive Coolpix models--although shutter speed, focus, etc. aren't accessible through menus, there are enough \"scenes\" to cover most situations.  And it's unlikely that the average user would be able to do a better job of adjusting these settings anyway.<br />One thing it's missing is a video out for connection to a TV--which the Sony camera in this price range does have.  But no camera in this price range has the Nikon's quality feel or graceful design.<br />Finally, the included software is great.  I've used the software bundled with Sony products before, and it's just awful.  The software Nikon gives you is unobtrusive--connect the camera via USB or compactflash reader, and a little window pops up, transfers the pictures, and leaves you alone.  Also, a panorama maker takes a collection of pictures and makes great 360 degree views (viewable in QuickTime), as well as APS-like panoramic shots.<br />Pros:<br />-Swivel lens is fun and protects the lens when not in use<br />-Many \"Scenes\" which allow for professional camera settings at the touch of a button<br />-Intuitive menu system<br />-Great software<br />Cons:<br />-No video out<br />-Small delay before shot is taken","I was given this camera as a gift and took it to France with me the next day. The pictures I was able to take were amazing!! Sunsets, fireworks, night landscapes...I was able to take them all. The delay described in some of the other reviews can be gotten around. I have some great pictures of the running of the bulls (and if that isn't action, what is?). I did buy an extra battery, but rarely needed to use it. I also was given a 128 mb storage disk which stored about 330 pictures at the second highest setting (photo quality). The only problem I ever had was seeing the view finder in very bright sunlight. Also, Nikon has a great site for uploading the photos and sending the link to friends.","First off, let me say unlike EVERYONE that praises the Nikon Coolpix 2500, I could NOT care less for the cool styling and design.  What do I mean?  Well, my number ONE priority was the ongoing search for a compact pocket \"point and shoot\" camera for the least money (of course not compromising quality!) that I can carry anywhere like I carry my cell phone, period.<br />Since then, that is exactly what happened.  I've used it just about everywhere and anywhere without feeling I had to treat it with \"kid-gloves\" and worry about its well being whenever taking it out for any type of use.  All of you who have owned expensive cameras will appreciate THIS priceless feeling.  It takes great pictures and is LOADED with user-friendly features which at one time or another are all incredibly useful... and best of all?  It remains a pocket camera!<br />If you are the creative and resourceful type, you will notice the swiveling inner zoom lens is useful to capture photos from just about any angle.  In fact, I've used it many times to take a close-up picture of a friend and myself if there is no one to take the photo for you.  Not to mention, you have a timer feature also.  Given the professional field I'm in, I also use it for close ups to capture telephone numbers and names on signs, billboards, and magazine pages with any writing or information on it.<br />ONE negative (or else I would have given it 5 1/2 stars)...the 8 MB CompactFlash card that it comes with...well,... It's useless (for the 15 images it holds at default settings).  Upgrade to at least a 128 MB CompactFlash Memory Card, hence add an approximate [$$]-[$$] to your original purchase price - well worth it.  At default settings (which is GOOD quality) I've taken over 300+ pictures without worrying of running out of film,.. umm, I mean memory, before docking the Coolpix2500 to my PC for download.  Speaking of, once you connect via USB port, in only ONE click, you are downloading your pics...and as for the proprietary lithium-ion rechargeable battery which is included? Very nice.<br />Ironically, I never read any reviews at the time of my purchase in the early part of the year.  In fact, as I later found out it was the first few days the Coolpix 2500 was out on the market.  Therefore for me, it was three and a half-hours of in-store experimenting with ALL the digital cams priced nywhere from [$$$]-[$$$].<br />Therefore unlike many people, the \"cool\" factor never did blur my analysis in arriving to my final decision.  So when people approach me and mention how neat my pocket sized Coolpix2500 looks, I always have to respond, \"but it also takes great pictures, and check out these features...\"  Today I view the slick factor and \"cool\" design as a bonus.","I just returned from a trip to Alaska where I took 450 images with a new Nikon Coolpix 2500. While riding my bike (fast!) down a packed dirt trail, the camera fell out of my vest pocket. It hit so hard, the battery popped out while the compartment was still locked. It continues to work flawlessly. I've owned Nikon cameras (35mm) for 30+ years and I'm glad they're still making them as rugged as ever.<br />I would give it 5 stars, but the camera comes with only an 8MB memory card. I had to pay [more money] for a 256MB card, plus [more]for a spare battery.<br />Also, I was nervous that 2 megapixels would be be enough, but it works great for 8x10s.<br />The swivel lens for self-portraiture is nifty, too, for capturing a shot with a fish you will soon release.","Well I bought this camera as a gift for someone and I am now regretting it.  We can't seem to get it to take any night or dark pictures.  There are 12 different modes on for the different background settings, like portraits, back light, etc.  None will take a good picture.  And, if you slightly move the camera in the darker settings, its ALL a blur. I am very disappointed.  My old Olympus Camedia works awesome still.  I am now thinking about returning this camera.  Oh, and the video mode on this camera... forget it. Sure it will shoot video, but there is no sound and if you don't have day light and a lot of it, its no good.  My next camera choice might be another Olympus or a Sony.  I think the best way to judge these cameras is to ask others what they are using and look at their pictures.  So far the sony is the best I have seen.  Very rich in color.","This is my first digital camera and it has performed quite nicely.  I have been extremely pleased with the quality of the images.  Using a mac connected to an epson photo 750 printer allows me to print some near photo quality 4x6 pictures (from pictures taken on the normal setting of the camera).  The lag time other reviews talk about can be reduced by pressing the shutter button halfway down-- this allows the camera to auto focus on the subject.  Then continue pressing the shutter down to take your picture. (You can hold the shutter button down halfway to autofocus for a short time before you actually take the picture-- this is Nikon's recommendation for taking action shots),","I bought this camera for a recent trip to Disneyland.  I have been several times and have always just had a regular point and shoot type camera.  At the end of trips I always ended up with things I wished I could have framed better or pictures that weren't quite lit-up enough.  So, I shopped around for a digital camera and my requirements were simple:  something small and discreet, easy to use, and came with easy to understand software.  I was not disappointed when this camera arrived!  It is everything I wanted and more.  One of my favorite features of this camera is that it comes with a rechargable battery and the charger.  Not only does it charge up relatively quickly (60-90 minutes) but it held the charge through 2+ days of pictures for me!  This was a great upgrade for me and in the long run it will save me money because I don't have to develop film any more!  Plus, I can \"discard\" pictures I don't like and take them again before it's too late.  All in all, I love this camera!","i'm not a professional photographer, and i don't have a need for a larger megapixel camera, so this is great.<br />first off, if you're a mac user, it works perfectly with iphoto. you odn't have to worry about installing anything, all you do is take it out of the box, take a picture or two, and hook it up to your mac. iphoto does the rest.<br />the pictures i've taken have been great. i can't complain about the quality. all my pictures have come out sharp and clean.<br />the swivel lens is great for taking pictures at weird, fun angles, and allows you a lot of options for different sort of pictures.<br />it's a very attractive little camera. everywhere i take it, people just want to play with it. the size is great, it fits in my pocket and in one of the front pockets of my computer bag.<br />the negative is there is a delay, which another reviewer mentioned. it's more for when it's dark, and not as much an issue in good light.<br />some of the issues i had with it before i bought it worked themselves out.<br />i was worried about getting fingerprints all over the lens because you have to move it around, but i haven't really had a problem with that. you only have to be marginally careful about it.<br />i was also not sure about the different angles and was worried about moving parts, but really, that is one of the best parts of the camera.<br />one of the reasons i chose this over the comprable cannons was battery life (this is great) and mac compatibility. i'm not too sure how the cannon is with the mac (the model i was looking at didn't work with iphoto) but the nikon is flawless in this concern.","As a professional photographer, I bought the coolpix 2500 for snap shots. It is very easy to use and so small that I can put it in my shirt's pocket and carry with me all the time. The image quality is good when enlarge up to 8\"x10\". I like the close up mode both the sharpness and colour are very good. The only drawback is the flash is too close to the lens that makes people always have red eye. But it can reduce by using the red eye reduction flash option.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone who need a compact and easy to use digital camera with a medium resolution.","This is a great camera! It has all the features the $[money] nikon digital camera has (at least the one my friend has) and looks like it takes pictures at 300dpi which is great compared to the 72dpi ones of yore... it also has the nikor lens which is astonishing. The built in shot picture settings are great! I love to use the Museum one whenevre there is ample light in the room. The manual mode is great too with lots of customization settings. This is an awesome camera!","Having used over 15 different digitals cameras in the past three years, I found the Coolpix 2500 to be the best all-around camera available.  The quality of the pictures is outstanding.  This is the easiest camera to use and the fastest one to grab when that great photo-op appears.  The Coolpix 2500 is light, easy to fit into a pocket or purse, comes with an adjustable string neckstrap and all of the accessories.  Because the lens tucks away into the camera, there is no fear of scratching it by mistake.  Truly a stroke of genius for Nikon - bringing digital to everyone!","I had been searching and pricing Digital Camera's for several months, and then stumbled upon this new product from Nikon and really liked the way that it doesn't look like a camera. It's compact size allows you to put it in a shirt pocket or sun glasses case... you can take it anywhere! and the different angles that you can place the lens and then store it back in its own body is really cool. It's features are also among the best in it's class allowing the user the ability to change most settings. The 16MB starter card is just that, and depending on camera settings will get you a limited number of pictures, but if you plan to take alot of pic's w/out downloading you will need a bigger card. The battery lasts quite a long time and must charge 2 hours before first use. My only beef is that the flash and the lens are next to each other and this seems to cause quite a bit of red eye even with the reduction on, other than that if your looking for a great camera that gives alot of bang for your buck and you dare to be different this is the camera for you !","I decided to get a digital camera in time for the birth of our first child, and I am very happy with my Nikon CoolPix 2500.  It's very simple to operate, takes great pictures, and the swivel lens makes it easy to take unusual but very stylistic pictures.  Being able to reverse the lens and take pictures of me, my wife, and our son is awesome.  I don't miss the viewfinder at all.  The only places for improvement are in startup times (from turning the camera on to taking the first picture takes a few seconds).  Works with iPhoto flawlessly!","This camera has almost all the coolpix photography options as the more expensive coolpix 995. The menu is easy to use and its use improves the image quality. Pressing the shutter half way in will set the sharpness and lighting thus allowing for even more manupilation of the image quality. On the otherhand the camera can do point and shoot as well. Some reviewers questioned the lack of a filter to protect the lens, but the filter is but in and when broken can be replaced. Drawbacks? Digital photography has its limits (like color saturation, number of pixels compared to price) and this camera seems to handle them appropriately. For higher quality in resolution and color saturation I go back to 35mm SLR camera with film.","I am a total novice to photography and wanted a camera for web posting and editing fun.  The Coolpix 2500 is almost a perfect 5/5 stars except for a couple minor (very minor) drawbacks.<br />  I have had the camera for 4 days and taken over 300 pics.  All pictures come out great in auto mode and I have experimented with the different scene modes--no problems at all.  The menu is very easy to use, bright and easy to see under most conditions  which brings the first drawback.  Being an lcd screen only without a viewfinder is a problem out in sunlight.  The screen becomes very washed out and difficult to see.  You can make out the general shapes and object positions but details are not identifiable when framing your photo in sunlight.  This as frustrating as it sounds really hasn't bothered me and I have just adapted to it tho there is a \"hood\" for the screen that I will probably give a try.<br />  The battery life seems to last a long time especially since the lcd screen is always on.  I haven't yet needed to buy a second battery but will anyway.  Charging the battery is stated to take about 2 hours but doesn't seem to go over 1 hour for me to get a full charge.<br />  The camera is very small ( like a pack of 100's cigarettes) and lightweight.  Even with my big hands I don't have any problem using all the buttons which are spaced nicely.<br />  Now the second drawback for me--The Nikon 5 software--.  WARNING before you buy just know that the software for downloading from the camera and editing WILL NOT WORK on Windows 98 First Edition.  In small print it says Win 98 SE, Win ME and XP.  It would be nice if they made an attempt to warn you that 1 version of Win 98 works and the other doesn't.  This may not be a problem for most people but since my PC's have all worked fine I opted to bypass 98SE, ME and XP until now.  Well rather than let all the software goto waste I went and upgraded to XP and I'm glad I did.  Downloading from camera to PC is flawless and from there you can upload to the web or start editing with a button click.  The editing software gets a novice 5/5 stars.  It is VERY easy to use and has all of the best tools I could want in a very concise and clean format.  Photoshop 6.0 for example has wayy too many buttons and menus for me to keep track of.  Cheers to Arcsoft for their fine product IMHO.<br />  The camera comes with a 16mb CF card but I opted to get the 128mb because Amazon.com had such a great deal when I bought it.<br />  In all I'm sure advanced camera users will most likely want something like the coolpix 990 or Powershot G2 but if you just want basic picture taking fun I'm sure you will enjoy this camera.","Nikon Coolpix 2500 is a great compact camera. I wanted to buy a camera that can work in an easy to use automatic mode for point & click situations like parties, casual travel; and also provides manual mode for experimenting & control. My choice was mainly between Coolpix 2500, Coolpix 995 & Canon Elph Series. I just fell for the cool styling of 2500 and the ability to carry it in my shirt pocket.<br />I just took it out to Australia for a week long trip. It has performed well under different lighting conditions.  All I needed to do was change the \"SCENE\".The camera allows me to identify the type of scene I am going to photograph. It has a bunch of \"SCENE\"  that I can select from. Some of them are - Beach, Landscape, Party, Portrait, Night Landscape, Backlight to name a few. I was also able to take night shots of the Opera house & the Harbor Bridge in the \"night landscape\" mode. They came out pretty well. I was happy to see the result in about 2 seconds - the duration of the exposure. Pictures taken in bright daylight like that on a beach also came of well. What disappointed was the photgraphs that I took at a night Bar-be-Q party. In most photographs, the people close to the camera looked bright and those away by more than 7-8 feet away from the camera looked dark. Another \"scene\" that I found useful was \"Close Up\". I wanted to note down a recepie from a local magazine. Instead of taking notes I just photographed the page in the \"Close Up\" mode. Now, I do not have to write them down ! I just read the recepie off the picture stored on my computer. It is not much of a \"Manual\" camera. So if you want to control everything, I recommend look else where.<br />I found the controls easy to use. There are a bunch of on-screen menu items, buttons & knobs. They are well layed out and are intitutive to use. Let me add - I am a techie. I can handle complexity. I had my first picture in about 10 minutes opening the box and charging the batteries. It took me about 1 hour to understand all the controls & install the software.<br />You got to buy a memory card unless you intend to save your pictures in a very basic picture format (like 640 X??). I bought a 128 MB card. It stores about 140 pictures in best quality mode (called \"FINE\"). The camera can be put on a tripod. That is a big plus for night photography.  It is very easy to put my fingers on the lens. So I have to worry about it all the time, specially while opening or closing the lens. A price for this cool design!<br />In a nutshell I find Nikon Coolpix 2500 a fun, easy to use camera for easy going photography.","This is a very solid little digital that should easily take care of 99% of your picture taking needs. It easily slips into the pocket, clever lens protector, nice, crisp LCD screen.<br />I had problems loading the software as once loaded, my PC could not see my camera. However, I used the Tech Support line which was quick and professional (had some issue loading the driver, but easily fixed).","I have a Coolpix 950 and had the chance to borrow a 2500 over the weekend.  This is a kewl little digital camera!<br />It does take some reading to understand all of its features, but you can start taking pictures without knowing all that stuff.  Just set it on automatic and shoot away!<br />Features I really liked:<br />Camera lens that could swivel up and down - this is really handy for when you need to photograph something holding the camera over your head.  You can see what you're getting on the monitor while pointing the camera where you want.<br />USB connections!  No need for a card reader.  Woohoo!<br />Small size - its more likely to come with to everyday places - where you might find something very worthy to photograph.  (Note: Nikon should've included a small case with it.  I found most camera cases too large for this camera, but a cloth eyeglass case worked great.  A way to protect the lens would've been nice too.  (Filters are not usable on this camera.)<br />Specialty settings:  Camera offers settings for parties (red eye reduction) copies (I think it was in black in white), close ups and so on.<br />Battery didn't need to be connected to camera to recharge.  If you purchase a second battery, you can charge one while using the other.  Some camcorders charge the battery only on the camera - which doesn't work well for long events.  I'm glad that Nikon chose the separate charging method.  I haven't found an additional battery for it - so I have no idea what they run.<br />Didn't like:<br />Like most point and shoot cameras, the flash doesn't travel far and the focus in low light rooms where the subject is over 20 feet away is not good.  But that seems to be normal for this kind of camera.<br />Battery/memory cover fell off and was tricky to replace.<br />Lens in likely place for fingerprints - would've preferred a replaceable lens filter for it.<br />Camera comes with a starter compact flash memory card.  Nowhere does it state how much memory is on it.  The package recommends 128mb, but I don't think that's what was included.  My best guess is that it was an 8mb card.  I filled it up the first day I had the camera and then switched to a 64mb that I had available.<br />---------<br />Overall, if I didn't already have a digital camera, I would love to have this one.","I bought this camera because I needed a point and shoot for an upcoming cruise. I already have a Sony Cybershot DCS-S30 that I am very happy with. I didn't want to bring my Sony on the cruise in fear that the elements (salt air and sand) would ruin it as well as be too awkward to carry around. When I saw this little Nikon it was love at first site. Not only was this camera stylish but its compact and has a lens that can swivel in (perfect for protection from the elements).<br />While I am satisfied with my purchase there are a few drawbacks to this camera. None of the drawbacks are too serious but for a spoiled gadget use such as myself they are inconvenient. I was disappointed that the battery was not pre-charged and I had to wait 2 hours to actually play with my new toy. After the battery was charged and I was putting it in place I noticed that the battery has to actually be removed from the camera to charge it in its charger (again a spoiled issue but still inconvenient). The operations (menus) of the camera are a bit clunky to get used to but I am sure in time I will get used to it. My last gripe would be the amount of time between hitting the shutter release and the time it takes to actually take the picture, its not very quick, actually pretty slow.<br />Enough moaning about the faults, what's so good about this little camera? Well it's little! It comes with some handy software. And it has an incredible lens (should you expect less from Nikon?). My Sony can't touch the quality of this lens. The digital zoom shows minimal amounts of pixalation.<br />If you are looking for a digital point and shoot camera I would definitely recommend this."]},{"name":"Nikon D100","amazon_reviews":["Very nice product.

MY hunting equipment is all Nikon and now my camera is too. It is just the excellent quality and craftsmanship that keep these guys moving. Thank you very much for the amazing camera. My girlfriend will now be super happy that I can now snap shots with her and of her and our family.","I purchased this DSLR for my wife 2 Christmases ago for an extremely low price and although the technology in this camera is dated and not up to par with what the market currently has to offer, As long as you have a basic understanding of photography and you have a clean lens, you can use photoshop or lightroom and create some amazing pictures.  I would not call myself an expert by any means, however as mentioned above with a basic understanding of photography and a basic understanding of what you can and cannot do with this camera, you will be good to go.  The biggest negative that I have above this camera is how dated the LCD screen is but hey back in 2002 I am sure it was epic.  For people who are concerned about not getting a good visual after the shot is taken, take my advise and only SHOOT IN RAW! Do not even waste your time with JPEG.  When you shoot in raw, you have the ability to edit the exposure along with other things later on in your post processing.

I used to be simply a point and shoot type of person before I needed training for work and we used this model. I fell in love with photography and especially Nikon with this model! I was amazed at how much clearer, vibrant, and detailed my photographs came out versus my old 3.2 mp Olympus (about 5 years old now). What a difference!! The D100 is also very easy to use...take this from a person who never before changed ISO or meter settings and within a couple of hours I was taking pictures that I think were on par with National Geographic.<br />This is a quality camera, feels sturdy but not too heavy. Lots of great features. I highly recommend Nikon just because they make a quality product with great results. You may pay a little more, but that's why I drive a Bimmer and not a Daewoo. Sometimes spending a little more makes the difference, especially if you're results oriented. =)","I bought this camera as a backup. I had one before but sold it to buy something else. The Seller AK was great and easy to do business with. He sold me a camera in near mint condition with lots of extras and he even had the firmwear upgrade done. Thanks AK.","i just recently bought this camera off of amazon and i got it for $175. The price couldnt be better in my opinion. Overall, for the amount of money that i spent on it, it was a deal but there are some problems. Personally i feel that the shutter lag time is too great. Regardless of shutter speed, there is about a half second delay between when the button is pressed and when the camera acutally takes the picture. Other than that it is a great camera with tons of features. I also would have liked the screen to be bigger but what can you do when it was made in 2002. I give it two thumbs up for its time.","I call the Nikon D100 the \"VOLVO\" of digital SLR cameras. It is safe and rugged, and once you buy one, you cannot buy any other. I bought the D100 about 3 months ago, and after test-driving it for a few months, I have been very happy with it.<br /><br />Photography has been my hobby for the past 12 years. I am an avid (and loyal) Nikon user, being the owner of the N70, N90, F4, and F5 35mm SLR cameras (yes, I have a thing for Nikon). Therefore, it is almost logical for me to stick with the Nikon brand, and hope that the lenses are interchangeable.<br /><br />I was quite skeptical about the capabilities of digital cameras, and I never thought digital technology will be able to catch up to film resolution for a while. Until now. I have to say that the Nikon D100 convinced me to take the first steps towards the digital revolution.<br /><br />Now, I primarily use the Nikon D100, and use my film cameras as back-up. I've only used my film cameras during rainy days, so that my new toy/investment would not get wet.<br /><br />I've made a brief list of what I noticed about the D100.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-instant on<br /><br />-fast response<br /><br />-nice fit in [my] hand; very ergonomic<br /><br />-superb resolution<br /><br />-default pictures have higher contrast<br /><br />-compatible with Nikon lenses, especially the Nikor F mount lens<br /><br />-LCD monitor cover comes with the camera(Thanks, Nikon!)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-6MP, compared to the 8MP of the Canon (20D and 350D)<br /><br />-moire effects<br /><br />-no firewire connection<br /><br />-does not properly tag JPEG images with correct color profile; have to use Nikon View software to separate images for full Adobe compatibility<br /><br />One camera that almost swayed me away was the Canon EOS 20D. I was fortunate to have friends who have these cameras, so I was able to make a head-to-head comparison of the Nikon vs. the Canon, and the pictures and features \"side-by-side.\" The pros and cons of each camera balance each other out, so in the end, it all comes down to personal preference, and what you like or dislike about these cameras.<br /><br />For me, it was because of loyalty* and investment. I saved a few thousand dollars because my lenses (especially the Nikor F mount lens) are compatible with the Nikon D100 (I was informed that they are also compatible with the D70, but that is second-hand information).<br /><br />Conclusion: The Nikon D100 is a great camera, which is cheap enough for the amateur photographer, and advanced enough for the professional photographer.<br /><br />Footnotes:<br /><br />* Loyalty did not come instantly. Like I said earlier, I have been a photographer (and therefore camera enthusiast) for 12 years, and it took me a few years to appreciate a good camera.","Now that Nikon and the rest have all moved on with the latest and greatest, this camera has come down in price enough to make it a good buy or at least worth a second look, for the serious amateur.  It also makes a great entry-level pro camera.<br /><br />Though its metal frame makes it heavier than most of its newer siblings, the solid construction of the D100 make it durable in even the most rugged conditions. With the addition of a new VR lens, it becomes an unbeatable digital SLR, especially for the price.  While lacking some of the bells and whistles of the latest Nikon cadillacs, it's a sold performer and still easily competes in the most important category: image quality.  Pictures are sharp and bright and the \"purple\" edging from which so many digicams and digital SLR pictures suffer, is unnoticable without serious magnification.<br /><br />A single caveat here.  As with most digital cameras these days, there are numerous functions accessible by a number of buttons and dials on the body, and even more through menu options.  This is not a camera you can put in the closet for a couple months and expect to easily remember how to use when you pick it up again.<br /><br />As a digital SLR, it does not fall prey to the dreaded shutter lag of digicams, of which the Nikon Coolpix line is the worst offender.  If you're looking to upgrade from a simple point and shoot camera or are advancing in your career as a serious amateur, this unit cannot be recommended highly enough.","My girlfriend purchased this camera for me for my birthday about 2 years ago, and I fell in love with it immediately. I'd already owned a Nikon 8008 film camera and was thinking of going digital anyway. But I'd recently spent a lot of money on new camera lenses for my SLR and didn't want to just lose out on the funds I'd expended. Amazingly, the Nikon D100 adapts my lenses to its frame and I can still use them! Awesome!<br /><br />I would argue, though, that this camera is compact. It isn't. It's just as large as my 8008, but I don't mind that. I like the feel of a bulky camera in my hands. It feels firm and I have something substantial to hang onto. I've see these tiny little digitals that have buttons the size of pinheads on them and they drive me crazy! I'm a big guy (6'3, 250 pounds), so I need something bigger. Thankfully the D100 was (is) the answer.<br /><br />I also enjoy the large view screen on the back of the camera, giving me a peek at the image I just took.<br /><br />There is some controversy still surrounding digital imaging and printing. One group of photographers say that printing on a home printer is too expensive (ink and paper costs), while another group says that film is too expensive because you can't delete what you shoot, can't pick and choose which images to have developed; you've gotta pay for them all. I'm in the latter group. Although photo paper and ink cartridges are expensive, being able to delete images and select only the very best for printing far surpasses the film option in both convenience and cost.<br /><br />This is a fantastic camera. But a friend of mine just purchased the D70 model (the latest and greatest Nikon Digital Camera), and boy does that one look nice, too! Hmm. What to do?","I call the Nikon D100 the \"VOLVO\" of digital SLR cameras.  It is safe and rugged, and once you buy one, you cannot buy any other.

Like I said earlier, I have been a photographer (and therefore camera enthusiast) for 12 years, and it took me a few years to appreciate a good camera.","The Nikon D100 is an excellent digital camera.  I consider myself an advanced amateur and I bought the camera almost two years ago.  I chose the D100 because I was very happy with the Nikon Coolpix 5000 and because of Nikon's reputation.  The 6MP CCD sensor captures images with brilliant color and clarity.  No one can tell that my photos are digital.  I have enlarged photos up to 20x30 inches and it is still impossible to tell the photos are digital.  After purchasing this camera, I hardly ever use my film SLR's.<br /><br />The Nikon D100 was designed based on the Nikon N80.  The D100 has a rugged, well-designed body.  There is a large, bright LCD screen on the rear of the camera.  The LCD is used for reviewing photos and changing settings.  (Most digital SLR's use the LCD similarly.)  The viewfinder must be used for taking photos.  Most of the camera settings may be changed using the controls on the body or scrolling through the LCD.  The camera uses compact flash memory cards which are readily available and is also compatible with microdrives.  I prefer the faster speed 1GB compact flash cards.<br /><br />The D100 comes with a rechargeable battery, battery charger, camera strap, manual, USB cable, AV cable and Nikon View software.  The Nikon View software is used to transfer photos from the camera to the computer and has a few basic photo-editing tools.  I recommend purchasing a compact flash reader for the computer.  Nikon Capture software is also available separately.  Nikon Capture is a powerful photo-editing program made specifically for the Nikon digital SLR's.  Aside from photo-editing, Nikon Capture allows the photographer to connect the D100 to a computer without a compact flash card.  Photos are stored directly onto the computer hard drive.  Other features of the Nikon Capture software include changing camera settings and taking photos without touching the camera.  Everything can be controlled from the computer.  This is convenient for studio photographers.  The battery life is amazing.  I purchased an extra battery and usually charge the batteries after several months.  The AV cable is a nice accessory because it can be used to display photos on the television in a slideshow mode.<br /><br />Photos taken at the fine resolution (6 MP) are very sharp and detailed.  There are three formats for photos - raw, jpeg and tiff.  I have purchased several 1GB faster speed compact flash cards and I usually keep my camera at the large jpeg and fine setting.  I have taken beautiful photographs in the raw setting as well.  The enclosed Nikon View software allows the user to edit the photo without changing the file.  The Nikon Capture software has far more editing tools and functions than Nikon View.  I would recommend using faster speed compact flash cards in the raw setting, otherwise the camera sometimes lags when the buffer is full.  (This only happens if more than six photos in the raw setting using a traditional, slower compact flash card are taken within a few seconds.)  I seldom take photos in the tiff format.  (Tiff is basically an uncompressed jpeg file.)<br /><br />Nikon is famous for both cameras and lenses and has a large variety of lenses and accessories.  After purchasing the D100, I bought a 24-85mm zoom lens, 28-300mm telephoto lens, 60mm macro lens, 1.5x teleconverter and SB-50 external flash unit.  One zoom lens may be sufficient for amateurs.  The three lenses have been more than sufficient for my needs.  (I seldom use the teleconverter.)  I may add a wide angle lens to my collection.  When purchasing lenses for the D100 (or most other digital SLR's with CCD sensors), it is important to note that there is a 1.5x conversion factor (i.e., a 24-85mm lens becomes a 36-127.5mm lens).  The conversion factor is great for distant subjects but may be inconvenient for close subjects.  Nikon has released a series of DX lenses specifically to address this issue.<br /><br />Other items that I bought after purchasing the D100, include the Canon i9100 photo printer and Adobe Photoshop.  I used Photoshop LE before purchasing the D100 and decided to upgrade to the full version of Photoshop after my purchase.  I use Photoshop for almost all my photo-editing.  I only use Nikon View for photos in the raw format.  Most of the time, I edit the raw photos as needed in Nikon View and then convert the raw photos into jpeg.  The newer version of Photoshop CS is able to read the Nikon raw format.  Adobe Photoshop Elements may be sufficient for most amateurs but Photoshop is more powerful and fun to use.  The Canon i9100 prints stunning photos but it can be expensive to print photos at home.  The ink cartridges and photo paper can become expensive over time.  I print at home when I need a few sample photographs or I need the photos immediately.  Most of the time, I print my digital photos at Costco One Hour Photo.  The photos are reasonably priced and available within an hour.  Similar photo processing services are now available at drugstores, grocery stores and discount department stores.  It is also convenient for photographers who do not want to deal with the entire photo-editing and processing situation.<br /><br />I recommend the Nikon D100 for advanced amateurs and professionals.  The camera takes beautiful photos and is definitely a good investment.  I learned a lot about digital photography and photography in general after purchasing this camera.  I love this camera so much that I will probably never use film again.","This is a good camera, but it's a little behind the times. The only real complaint is the requirement to purchase a special adapter to use commerical lights etc.<br /><br />The software and features are also a little dated, but it's still a pretty good deal overall, if you cant spend 5 Grand on a camera (The new DX2) it's a good choice.<br /><br />Next year they are supposed to be bringing out updated pro-sumer SLR's but I still think the camera is a great value for your money.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Good luck, great camera.","As a serious amateur (means limited budget), the D100 was chosen for several reasons. 1. It would take all my Nikon lenses and resembled the layout and feel of my F80 (N80). 2. It is compatible with my SB28DX flash and has a cable release on the shutter button. 3. It has been out long enough (post Nikon D70) to have come down in price, and many are available second hand. 4. It has USB for down loading, and produces excellent 8 by 10's on my inexpensive ink jet printer. 5. The Nikon Viewer software is very user friendly, and links to Adobe Photoshop. 6. It produces RAW (NEF) files (nearly 10Mb!) and they make fabulous 11 by 17's at the commmercial labs. 7. Yes, it is heavier than my Sony DSCV1, but it is worth it. All in all I am very satisfied: compared to film...instant gratification!","I've always been an avid Nikon user. And from now on I'm even more than ever!<br />I haven’t been able to put it down since buying it in July, 2004.<br /><br />The picture quality & clarity is amazing, as if you’re actually  there in the photo!<br />I’ve flown front seat in a helicopter this summer and took some great arial photos! \"National Geographic Magazine\" here I come!!!<br /><br />This baby has a lot of great functions!<br />The quick speed of the playback monitor & deletion of unwanted photos are must-have functions! It's nice to have only good photos, rather than over-exposed trash. I’ve been able to take so many photos with this thing, I don’t know what I’ll be doing with my F90X and the rest of my other film cameras. There’s no end to the imagination with the D100. With my F90X, the colors and effects are lost during the development of the film and the printing of the photo. Having the D100, I’ll have less worry over my photo’s results.<br /><br />During my partner's 25-day business trip, he only shot about 362 photos out of 598 & only recharged the battery once. Spares come in handy, that's for sure! I have a 20-35mm. f/2.8D Zoom lens. I used that baby left and right with the F90X and it seems to be the perfect lens for the D100 (FYI…this lens is discontinued and has been replaced by a 17-35 f/2.8D).<br />Our D100 is loaded with a 1Gb memory card that gives me 598 frames configured as jpeg normal, large (3,008 X 2,000) Pixels.<br /><br />Battery life is excellent. We don’t have to change the battery all that much, and when we do, it recharges quite promptly. If you don’t play with the monitor frequently you should be able to take about 1600 shots on 1 battery.<br />Obviously, frequent use of the Monitor takes up a lot of battery juice. I try not to use the monitor much because of just that. Owning this Baby is fantastic, because it’s saving us a bundle of money on film & reprints.<br />If our friends ask for a copy of a photo/s, we just email them out and it’s done! No more waiting on Friday afternoons at the photo lab!<br /><br />Some Good Technical Points about the D100:<br />- Dynamic-Area AF (Auto Focus): Useful when you have an erratically moving subject. The focus will readjust itself.<br />- You can adjust the ISO sensitivity from 200 to 1600 and HI-1 and HI-2.  Trust me, it works great with proper use!<br />- White Balance: (the color of light reflected from any object). The white balance makes sure that whites are whites in any given situation instead of coming out a shade of gray.<br />- AF-Assist Eliminator: It helps the camera Auto-focus on a poorly lit subject by sending a beam of light on the subject to help the focussing process.<br />- Memory Buffer: is extremely quick for fast, consecutive shots.<br />- Comfortable to hold in right hand<br />- Fairly Light, depending on the lens used<br />- You can input comments on the monitor, with the keyboard area, to the comment area and attach it to your picture.<br />- All Nikkor lenses are compatible with the D100, depending on the nature of the lens. Some minor adjustments or compensations or different settings may need to occur. (out of focus or manual lens, AF-S, AF-I Nikkor lenses etc…)<br />- True to life color photos<br /><br />Photo Manipulation:<br />Each photo, when uploaded to the computer is about 1.5Mb in size.<br />With the use of Photoshop, I usually have to make only minor adjustments to the levels, depending on what needs to be enhanced. With the D100, I’ve tried taking photos indoors without the flash, but it doesn’t guarantee clarity unless you crank up the ISO sensitivity, and use the noise reducer. You may find yourself needing to use the flash indoors, more often, because it will most likely result in a blurred or distorted photo. With the D100, I'm able to capture indoor images I've only dreamt of, and didn't need to use slow speeds and a tripod.<br /><br />Our first Nikon was the F1 standard model with a Photomic Head, in 1969. I've had many disappointments with my non-digital Nikon models because of multiple visits to the repairman, resulting in the carbon track in the Photometer being worn out & couldn't be replaced. That would explain why all my photos were always over-exposed. I’ve always had wrong readings.<br /><br />My partner’s decision to switch to digital was one of his greatest purchases within the past year, among other things! I suggest you invest in this camera because you won’t be sorry!","I have had my D-100 for six months, having used a Coolpix 5700 for two years, and I am satisfied but not ecstatic. My first 20 shots were underexposed, lacked color depth, and were short on flash. After adjusting the settings through the menu, it came to life. You can control this machine in any way you can imagine, but experienced buffs all know that the lens is the most important ingredient.<br />Your choice of lenses, being aware of the 1.5 correction factor--which Nikon Tech Serv says applies to all DX Lenses also--will determine how you use this precision instrument. My old Nikon lenses worked well for a few months, but my 35-70 Zoom (53-105 actual)was not adequate, because I had gotten used to the great range of my Coolpix. For me, this meant an 18-35 Zoom (27-53 actual) and a 24-120 Zoom (36-180 actual) The latter has proven to be fantastic, and all but the wild wide angle crowd will be happy with this choice. Indoors and close quarters will favor the 18-35 Zoom, but mine remains boxed.<br />This is no lightweight to haul around, but the photo perfection is worth the effort!","Obviously from the other reviews the camera is fine. The problem is if you have a problem with it. My auto-focus gave out about a week after the warrant ended. I was charged $775.00 to repair it. Nikon kept it for 38 days. Sent it back and never reapaired the problem.<br />They took it back worked on it for a week- waived the $293.00 charge. Guess what? I am on holsd with the service department as it was sent back with the same problem.<br />Speaking of service forget about ever speaking to a real person unless you have 2-4 hours to kill.<br />never again .","Unless you want to become obsessed, because that's what happened to me.  There are not enough good things to say about this camera.  I love the many features, the fast start-up, compatibility with my other lenses for my standard Nikon cameras.  It's so easy to use, and takes fabulous pictures.","I just got back from seven days in Yosemite with my D100 which I bought back in December. I shot 6071 images. I took two batteries. I changed the batteries three times and I only had to recharge twice. I never had any downtime. I bring the images into Photoshop and make one small levels change, one small selective color correction to the neutral colors, and one small unsharpen filter change. I apply the same three changes to every image automatically and the images are perfect. I upload to one of the online photo services and get perfect 5x7s. I only use the small+fine resolution setting since I never need more than 5x7s. The small+fine resolution (1504x1000) is just a little smaller than a 2Meg picture (1600x1200) and has plenty of data for high quality snapshot images. The ISO/ASA sensitivity settings are great. I don't even bother using a flash. When I'm indoors, I set the ISO to 1600 and fire away. If the image comes out too dark, I set the exposure compensation to +1ev all the way up to +4ev. I was able to capture indoor images that I've been trying to get for years, and I didn't need to use slow speeds and a tripod (who'll let you use a tripod indoors anyway these days). I have found that the program mode works really well with lenses that have the 62mm front end. My 28mm lens with the 52mm front end doesn't seem to let enough light in, so the image is a little overexposed, but I fixed that by setting the exposure compenstion to -1ev. It's also important to set the ISO Auto feature to OFF. Great battery life and enought buttons and switches and settings to allow for lots of creativity. I've used Nikons for twenty five years and I've had many disappointing non-Nikon digitals. I'm very, very happy with this one. Sometimes I dream of the D2H, but this is half the price and very lightweight which is important to me when I'm in the field. I'm already thinking of buying a second one so I won't have to change lenses. I bought mine right here at Amazon and I'd do it again.","I've been using digital for several years and a Nikon film SLR and this is the best combination of both.  There is a short learning curve to learn how to make adjustments, but once you learn its a breeze.  From fully automatic shooting to manipulating every aspect of shooting this camera performs like a Ferrari. The quality in .jpg is absolutely amazing.  With this camera and Photoshop you will have print quality photos immediately.  I'm only using a 512mb cf card and it holds up to 150 high quality images. I do a little freelance once in a while and I will be using 100% digital from now on.  Unless you're doing full page magazine spreads or large blow ups, no need to spend the extra money for the higher end digital SLR's.  This is a winner all the way around.  [...]","I'll be the first to tell you I'm no professional but so far this camera has been amazing.  For the past four years my wife and I have been using the Nikon N60 and it has more than met our needs.  My decision to switch to digital was based on 2 important points.  First, we found 16 undeveloped roles of film around the house.  After realizing it would cost well over a hundred dollars to develop them and I know we won't like at least half the shots, we decided we needed to move to digital.  Now with the D100 I can pick-and-choose exactly which shots I keep, retouch, crop etc then download them to someone like Walmart.com.  For exactly the same price I end up with the exact pictures I want. Up to now I refused to get a digital because the N60 takes such beautiful shots.  Past digital cameras' shutter lag was so bad you'd have to predict where a moving subject is going to be when you hit the button.  What sealed the deal for us is the D100 has no noticable lag, and it uses all the lenses we already had for the N60.<br />The D100 looks and feels just like my old N60 only lighter.  It acts and sounds just like a 35mm SLR, the camera internals are the same except with a sensor in place of the film strip.  In fact a co-worker, and long time digital user, was checking it out and couldn't figure out why it was \"all blurry\" when he looked through the view finder.  He also had a hard time finding the \"zoom button\".<br />I highly recommend this camera.  If you were reluctant to switch to digital because you loved your old SLR then this is definetly the replacement for you.","This camera delivers nice pictures most of the time, but it is lightly built, very plasticy.<br />Image quality:  I find it a bit too noisey for the money, and somewhat lacking in detail.  Not a big enough imporovement over the 5MP Sony F717 to justify the cost difference.  In some instances the Sony is better.<br />Overall quality:  The F717 seems heavier duty, it is all metal and although the body is smaller, it feels heavier that the D100.  Not a lot, but a nice solid piece of work compared to the plasticy Nikon.  The D100 feels hollow, cheap for an expensive DSLR.  The menu systems are not very intuitive, and sometimes the camera won't take a picture until you get out of them.","Having had three different digital cameras prior to purchasing the D-100, I was ready to move up to a Digital SLR and get away from annoying shutter lag.<br />After waiting for more than a year, I now have the Nikon D100 and couldn't be happier. I've been putting this camera through its paces and haven't been disappointed yet.  It captures images under most any lighting conditions with stunning results.<br />I have been amazed and very pleased with the batteries.  They seem to last forever, though I'd still recommend carrying an extra one if you shoot as much as I do (an old habit from my previous three digital cameras) - though you'll probably find that you won't be changing the battery very often.<br />Being able to use Nikon D and G lenses is another plus for those who own Nikon equipment and wanting to make the switch to digital - you don't have to invest in lenses all over again - but, keep in mind that there is a 1.5x lens ratio difference that may take a bit to adjust to, but with instant feedback from the camera that shouldn't be a major obstacle.<br />Using this camera, I can tell that Nikon did its homework and put a lot of thought into this product.  The result will be many happy hours of shooting and thousands (if not more) of stunning images!  Be sure to get extra 512mb CF cards!","The D100 camera is great.  I shoot in raw format.  It has two short comings.  First, your can only take four pictures and then you have to wait for the buffer to become empty.  I wish Nikon had a service to increase the size of the buffer for pictures shot in raw mode.  For every other JPEG mode the buffer is not a problem.  Second, the zoom controls on the rear viewer do not work in raw format.  They work just fine in JPEG.  I really like the camera and have printed hundreds of 13 X 19 pictures on the Epson 2200 printer.  ...just my two cents!","There are plenty of reviews here and elsewhere that extol the virtues of this camera and I have found the quality to be very good. At this stage I don't plan on using film again.<br />But, three issues need to be pointed out to prospective buyers.<br />TTL flash. If you have enjoyed using TTL flash on your nikon film cameras for years and have learned to love it, beware. The D100 does not support TTL flash, only D-TTL. Your trusty macro ring flash or SB26 will not work in TTL mode. Read the owners manual online to check the flash compatability list before you commit. You can use your flash in manual mode and get instant feedback on the lcd monitor, but if your subject has flown and your manual setting was wrong, tough! The strange thing is the the Fuji S2 which uses nikon lenses and flashes can work in TTL flash mode. If flash is very important to you then look at the S2.<br />Another issue to remember is the ccd sensor is smaller than a 35mm frame so there is a 1.5x magnification factor applied to all of your lenses. This is great news for your 300mm f2.8, which becomes 450mm f2.8, wow! In my case it is not so good when my 18-35mm goes to 27-52.5mm. For all you wide angle devotees, 27mm is nothing like 18mm is it? You can now buy a 12-18mm lens especially for nikon digitals but it is not cheap and it won't work on your film cameras.<br />Finally, if you plan on using the bulb setting for exposures of a few minutes, such as for astrophotography, The results may disappoint. There is not only electroluminescence picked up from other on-chip electronics, but the chip appears to heat up with long exposures. If you do 3 x 5 minute exposures with the lens cap on, the noise level increases significantly with each exposure. This makes dark frame subtraction dangerous as you may well loose photographic data. The camera would probably perform better in very low ambient temperatures, but I haven't tried that  so far.<br />Otherwise an excellent camera.","OK, I haven't bought a D100 - yet. But I'm in the market for a replacement for my ancient Kodax digital, and I've just about decided that the Nikon D100 is going to be it.<br />For one thing, my main non-digital SLR was a Nikon FG and I loved it. I acquired a high end Minolta, but I never liked it as much as the Nikon, and I have several Nikon AF lens and a couple of Tamrons, and I've always sorry that I couldn't use them with digital photography. The new digital camera bodies solve this problem.<br />The suggestion: go to [...] and click the D100 image at the bottom of the page. You'll get a **complete** set of detailed views and specs for the D100, almost a users manual (except it isn't downloadable) in the form of mousable images of all the controls and features. Answers almost any question you might have. (There is a listing of specs that is downloadable).","This is an awesome digital picture-taking machine, which heralds the imminent death of 35 mm film.  The D-100 does pretty much everything that a high-end film SLR does, and it does it beautifully.  A 512MB CF card will enable the D100 to take hundreds of high-quality pictures that are indistinguishable in quality from those taken with film.  The Six-megapixel images in Large/Fine or RAW mode are quite competitive with their film counterparts for almost all purposes.  The advantage of digital, of course, is that the consumer, equipped with pretty much any computer, can process and print the pictures him or her self with far more power and flexibility than one had in a darkroom processing film.  The digital darkroom has arrived.<br />The D100 can use Nikon's entire line of autofocus lenses and many of the older manual focus lenses, allowing the photographer to easily migrate from film to digital.  The camera has spot, matrix, and center-weighted exposure options, a programmed mode, apature priority or speed priority, as well as all of the manual options.  Autofocus is crisp, fast, and works very well in low light.  This camera is nearly as powerful in terms of its focusing and exposure options as the Nikon F5, which is the film camera I used for years before replacing my F5 with the D100.<br />Perhaps the greatest testimonial for the D100 is that it is notorious that the vast majority of photographers who I know who have bought a D100 never (or at least rarely) shoot film ever again.<br />The D100 takes OK shots right out of the camera, but to get best results most photographers will want to \"process\" the pictures through either Nikon's own program \"Capture 3\" or an aftermarket program like Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements.  I and probably most others have found that some of the post-processing settings on these programs really improve the images produced by the D100.  This is a deliberate design \"feature\" of the D100 in that the D100 anticipates that serious photographers wish to retain a certain amount of control over their images.  Accordingly, rather than making all of the decisions for you, the D100 produces images for which final exposure and contrast decisions can and should be made in a post-processing program such as Adobe Photoshop Elements or Capture 3.  That having been said, the D100 can and does produce fine images without using a post-processing program.  But almost all users have probably found that the best results are achieved by using such a program.  In my opinion this is true of pretty much all of the high-end digital cameras out there, and is not confined to the D100.  This is the power of digital photography--the photographer, at little cost (a low-end PC and $100-200 program are all that are required) can have a powerful \"digital darkroom\" which yields tremendous control over how the images turn out.<br />Physically, the D100 is ruggedly built.  The rear LCD is bright and clear.  The menu systems on the D100 are very well designed and quite intuitive--after familiarizing myself with the manual for several hours, I now find that I do not need to refer to the manual at all even for very complex \"custom\" situations.  The menus are not overly \"layered\" as is the case with some digital cameras.  The on-board flash is fine for snapshot portraits and the like, but most serious users will want to spring for either the SB-50DX or the SB-80DX flash, both of which are more or less designed for the D100.<br />Negatives on the camera are few.  I mentioned above the post-processing issue, which in my mind is not a negative, but instead is just Nikon giving the photographer as much power and flexibility as possible.  The matrix metering is not as powerful on the D100 as on the top-of-the-line F5, inasmuch as in tricky lighting situations the D100s center-weighted or spot metering will sometimes yield better results.  Having said that, after several hours of experimenting I can now confidently take consistently good pictures with the D100 in fill-flash conditions.  In common with the exposure issues, the D100 more or less requires photographers who want very \"sharp\" images to apply \"sharpness\" post-processing.  Most of us have probably found that this produces better results than setting the sharpening in-camera, for reasons that exceed the scope of this review.<br />By the way, the battery life in the D100 is phenomenal.  The on-board proprietary Nikon battery lets you take many hundreds of pictures, and serious shooters can buy at modest cost the MD-100 accessory which lets you shoot with either 2 Nikon batteries or a bunch of AAs.  Either way this allows you to literally shoot all weekend likely without needing to recharge.  The Nikon batteries recharge in a bit over an hour.<br />For good reason the D100, retailing now (October 2003) below $1,500, has put powerful digital photography in the hands of serious amateurs.  It is a well-designed and sturdy camera that is a delight to own and use.","I am a serious SLR hobbyist since 1994. I spent all my college summer work money to buy the Nikon legend F5. But, the fact is that I can never learn all the F5 features or at least has some sort of grip on all the features. Film based SLR could really break your bank if you are not a professional who can earn the money back by photos. I ended up putting my F5 on the shelf most of the time. (but still I like it so much :)) So, it is definitely time for a digital SLR move. I was thinking about switching my gears to Canon as the 10D has quite a lot good reviews. People complaint D100 is just a modified toy from Nikon 80. Well, I spent six months to do my deep research. Nikon D100 is the final choice, and it is the RIGHT choice. All features on the D100 is similar to the F5. I am using it to practice for my F5. 2 X 512 MB cards gives me just enough to handle my one day trip to SeaWorld. The camera has incredible speed for me to capture all the Shamu pictures. 3 frames per second give me plenty of speed. The buffer also seems to handle all my quick shots without slowing me down. Battery life, incredible, I shot more than 500 shots without even close to finish one charge. One thing kind a disappointed me a bit is when you set to use the highest raw resolution. The 17 MB file really gave my compact flash some real test. It took 5 minutes to write all six files (the max it can store in buffer) to the card. AND the worst thing is that if you accidently switch off the camera during the buffer transfer, all the images in buffer will be flushed away without any warning! I am using regular Kingston 512 MB card. I am not sure how well it will perform on those so called high speed card. Therefore, for my case, setting it to FINE mode is the most practical settings. The body works very well with my Nikon 20-35 2.8 and 70-200 2.8 lenes. My old SB-26 flash is not usable on this camera. it doesn't support the new D-TTL feature of D100. Picture quality? Super! Period.","I don't know why the reviewer says that this camera is not professional because he can't use it in broadcast tv, etc.  You should always make sure you're getting the right camera for a given purpose.  Plus, I have both the D1X, and this D100.  I use the D100 as back-up and as a first line camera from time to time.  I find that the images produced by each camera have superb detail and contrast; and I find that using the same lens, side by side photos taken by both, make it difficult to determine which camera they came from.  Being 100% candid, the D1X does produce some of the best images I've seen, but the D100 is no slouch and I dare you to find noticeable noise, unlike smaller cameras with a lot of megapixels.  If you like to take pictures of Uncle Charley's wedding, or a photo to enter a contest, or even to manipulate with one of the photo editors, I believe you'll find the D100 an incredible bargain.","I have only had this baby for 2 days, but it has been a workhorse, as I have gone through hundreds of images in that time.<br />It has miniscule boot time; take the lens cap off, switch to the ON position; take photo > super quick.<br />I bought it w/ the AF-Nikkor 28-105mm F3.5-4.5D lens, and a 1GB 32x Lexarmedia CF card.  Works fine so far; I will be adding lenses and accessories as time goes on.<br />Nikon has produced a real winner.","This is a brilliant amateur camera for what Nikon calls the prosumer market- consumers who fancy themselves professionals on the basis of having taken pictures for cousin George's wedding. When used with Nikon lenses and accessories it performs extremely well and is rugged enough but lacks those features that allow adaptation of the camera body for technical uses, live TV monitoring, bellows use or anything that made the F series wonderful for innovation in imaging. In other words, if you want Nikon to dictate the limitations of your cameras based on marketing concepts this is a swell camera and cheap. On the other hand, do not think of  the D100 as a backup to professional cameras as the Nikkormat was for years. Neither should one depend on the owners manual to be  forthcoming about the camera's  limitations, the telephone help line is hopeless and the best information is on Nikon's UK website.<br />It's strictly prosumer man.","I recently upgraded to the D100 after having used the Coolpix 5700 for six months. The Coolpix was great, but the D100 is greater.<br />  Many of its functions, for instance, can be controlled by turning a dial or pushing a button; many consumer digital cameras require you to menu surf in order to change a simple-yet-important setting, such as metering mode or flash output. Better yet, the external controls are easily accessible. The D100's program mode is incredible; I have yet to take a picture in it and be disappointed by the results. Additionally, I can get 6+ hours of continual use; when I shoot for several minutes a day, the battery can last for weeks before the battery meter indicates a slight drop in battery strength.<br />  The camera excels in other areas, too. Its noise level is extremely low. In fact, in low-light situations, I do not hesitate to use settings of ISO 1250 or 1600, which show noise only if you scrutinize darker areas in the photo. I daresay that the D100's grain in its pictures is lower that that of the grain in equivalent-speed film. Unfortunately, the two highest ISO settings, HI-1 and HI-2, equal to ISO 3200 and 6400, respectively, show appreciable amounts of noise, but are acceptable for situations when you really need for the camera to be fast. The camera's low noise levels let me shoot in near-infrared light (with optional filters), something that can be tricky with digital cameras because they are designed to reject most infrared light (thus requiring a high sensitivity when working in NIR).<br />  I have just one complaint about the D100, and this is very significant if you do indoor action with a flash. The D100's maximum shutter sync speed is 1/180 of a second. This means that with a flash, the D100's maximum shutter speed is 1/180, opening the door for blurring of subjects. I recommend that you not use a flash and take advantage of the superbly-low noise levels at some of the higher ISO settings.<br />  Unless you plan to shoot a lot of indoor action using a flash, I wholeheartedly recommend this camera.","I bought the Nikon D100 a few weeks ago and frankly it was well worth the expenditure. The picture quality is as good as film, if not better, as I found it near on impossible to take a bad picture (unlike film). Its versatility of use with lens adaption gives it several advantages over the standard \"fixed\" digital Cameras. It SLR qualities and excellent focusing make it a leader and a must for enthusiasts, amateurs and professionals alike. With a good tripod its perfect. I can never stop playing with it! I have never taken so many pictures of my German Shepperd!","I am a serious amateur and after several years use (and happy ones at that) with a Sony Cybershot, I had outgrown it. I've owned the camera for nearly two weeks now and I am quite pleased with its performance and the quality of the photos. The advantages of this camera are many: interchangable lens, manual controls, camera settings easily changed from a dial and buttons right on the camera body so it is easy and quick, fantastic battery life, no shutter lag (in milli-seconds) and a number of others. It is not as light in weight as the Sony but it feels comfortable in my hands. The LCD screen allows you to review the images afterwards but not before - another reason the battery lasts so long. You will need to buy the lens separately. I purchased the inexpensive but decent for the price Nikkor Zoom 28-85mm G but there are other reviewers who took serious issue with this lens because of its plastic construction and its optics. Thus far my photos have come out very clear though I have not taken photos at every f stop. It has three metering modes matrix, center weighted and spot. You can also adjust exposure compensation. There seems to be a tendency to under expose the photographs which may be related to my technique or optics. In comparison with the Canon, I cannot comment as I have not used that camera. However, I know that Nikon has made high quality cameras both fully mechanical and digital. I would recommend it for serious amateurs who are going take a lot of photos and want the option of manual controls.","I read many reviews before finally deciding to spend this much money for a camera - and I am so glad I did.  Proof is in the pictures processed and they are beautiful.  All of the important buttons are on the outside and easily reachable.  Autofocus is fast and accurate.  Battery life is long and camera is easy to use and learn.<br />Lag time with pictures was always a problem with the other cameras I had used, but with this camera that is a thing of the past.  I really haven't found anything bad complain about with this camera.  A great buy.","This camera is the answer to my dreams.  Not only can I see what I'm shooting right away, I can rest assured that I didn't mess up an entire wedding or photo shoot!  The quality of the photos are AWESOME!<br />One of the best things that made me buy this camera is the lenses to my other Nikon AF's fit this one (besides the fact I've been a long time Nikon fan).  I was a little skeptical about the price, but this has me convinced that there is nothing better than this camera.<br />With a 512 MB memory card, I can get over 150 of the finest quality pictures.  I print them out on my hp photosmart 1215 and they are perfect!  Add Photoshop, and we got game!!<br />The battery on this seems to last forever!  I've done 2 photo shoots (with animals!) and played around with it quite a bit, and the battery is still at full level.  Instructions are easy to understand, it's easy to download, and it is just plain SWEET!<br />I've still got a lot to discover with this camera, but so far, it's worth the money!  If you're a serious amature or a pro, this camera is the best.  I'm ready to get rid of the old \"film cameras\" and buy another one!","I was expecting the resolution to be not quite up to film SLR standards, but what a suprise. Maybe custom photolab work could make film shots a higher resolution, though I doubt it. Taking the same shot with film, processing it through standard processing and comparing it to identical exposure, lens etc. with the D100 the digital camera outstripped the film camera in spades. No more film for me. No more trips to the processor, no more film costs, no more waiting. Just shoot and downlaod and manipulate away in the digital environment. I use this camera professionally(ronwood.com) for my work and can not recommend it too highly. Delighted!!!","Stop reading this review and just buy this wonderful camera if you're serious about digital photography.<br />There are only two REAL digital interchangable SLR to choose from.  Nikon D1H or D100.  If you are not a photojournalist, needing to carry your gear to desert war zone, and extreme environments.  You don't need the ruggedness of D1H, which is based on the F5 body.  If you don't need the insanely large memory buffer of D1H, D100 will satisfy all your need.<br />D100 has higher resolution than both the extremely fast D1H and the higher resolution cousin D1X (but slower), at half their price.  The only thing that's lacking is a smaller memory buffer, hence slower, and a slower flash sync at 1/180.  Unless you're doing a lot of daylight fill-flash, I wouldn't worry about this limitation.<br />Since the D100 is based on the N80, it's comfortable to hold and use.  The user interface is so much better than Canon's.  It's more ergonomic and comfortable than the more expensive Canon too.  Not to mention that Canon's is lacking a playback zoom feature which I find it very important in Digital.  You don't want to download your photo to your notebook computer every dozen  shots to examine the details and sharpness, do you?<br />Of course, it can use all your Nikkor lens.  (That's the main reason I'd never buy Contax, Pentax or Minota's digital camera.  Their lens selection is just too limited.)<br />Just buy it and you'd be happy.","Definitivamente un verdadera aliada para viajes largo donde necesite matener siempre un cuadro adicional la recomiendo con los ojos cerrados ,sus 6 megapixeles me ofrecen calidad para realizar vallas de carretera de manera excepcional, otro dato compra tarjeta compact flash de 1 gb y veras como no te aburres de tomar fotos todo el dia.... fotograficamente,  Tony Lindo C.","I have been buying various digital cameras for the past 4 years, starting with the 2 megapixel Olympus C-2020, then trading up to the C-3030 and eventually the 3 mp C-4040.  Although these cameras take wonderful photos and are a great form factor for travelling, etc, they all suffered from one significant shortcoming:  shutter lag.  So, I was inspired to pay the higher price for a digital SLR.<br />I now have the Nikon D100 with a variety of lenses and I can enthusiastically say that it is the best camera I have ever used -- digital or film.  In program mode, it is nearly impossible to take a bad photo with it.  It does an amazing job of focusing - fast and accurately. (In order to get full autofocus capabilities, you can use any Nikon \"D\" or \"G\" type lenses)  And it feels and works just like a film SLR camera.  No shutter lag at all.<br />Also, the user interface is sensible and easy to use.  This is especially important for this camera since there are so many customizable features.<br />My only disappointment with this camera is that in order to get the 10-pin connector (which allows the use of remote controls, for example), you have to pay (Money) for the battery pack.  That is a lot of money to spend and a lot of size and weight to add to the camera in order to get access to a tiny but useful connector.<br />This camera and the Canon D60 seem to be the begining of a whole wave of amazing digital SLRs, as I see that Kodak, Canon and others have new ones coming out with even higher resolutions.  But I think that my D100 will keep me happy for several years.","I'm not a professional photographer. I don't make a living off of my pictures. Most pros I've seen would opt for the much more expensive D1x or Canon EOS-1D as their primary DSLR, but wouldn't hesitate to have a D100 in their bag as a backup. If you're a very serious amateur or have professional aspirations, look no further than Nikon's new D100. At 6.1 MP, it can easily compete with standard 35mm film cameras up to 8x10 prints and beyond. Most people in this market will be wrestling between the D100 and the Canon D60. I'm not wed to Nikon, so the deciding factor in my selection was availability, price, and overall feel. The D100 just felt better and more substantial--with better switchgear--than the Canon. In most head-to-head reviews they usually come out in a draw, leaving it up to you to decide. They each possess strengths and weaknesses that the other doesn't, which balance the reviews without a clear nod to one over the other. Generally, most reviews tend to favor the sharpness of the Canon for still or studio work and the Nikon for outdoor or action work. The easiest decision will be whether you're fortunate enough to already have an existing lens collection. If you do, then the decision has already been made. If not, you can't go wrong getting the D100. There simply isn't enough room for a detailed review of the D100 in an Amazon blurb, but you'd be well advised to check out sites like DPreview.com (especially) and a myriad of others like StevesDigicams.com, etc. I would recommend getting the MB-D100 multifunction battery grip too. It adds another battery and the ability to use six (6) AA's in a pinch, plus it gives you a vertical grip, shutter release, and duplicate controls when in portrait mode, as well as a mini microphone and speaker that allow you to record voice remarks for each photo if you desire.<br />Naturally, the D100's image quality is astounding. Mated with quality lenses and proper technique you are left with no excuse for not producing the best photos you've ever taken. Friends and onlookers will drool with envy where ever you go, because you just can't hide a D100 with an MB-D100 grip and a fast AF 80-200mm f/2.8 ED IF zoom in your shirt pocket--forget about candids.<br />It's big, it's heavy, and it's all Nikon--and everyone will know that you're serious about your picture taking.","I just got the camera 3 days ago and did my first headshots today.  Awsome!  Great camera. Happy client.  Fast work flow.  I was torn between the Canon D60 and the Nikon.  And to be honest went with Nikon because it was the one that was available for my shoot -- But no regrets.  Great camera."]},{"name":"Kyocera Finecam S4","amazon_reviews":["I got the Kyocera S4 back in January 2003.  Great \"unkown\" digital camera.  For anyone who is doubtful of the quality, you should know that Kyocera makes digital cameras for Toshiba, and they are the parent company of Yashica and Contax, two of the most respected names in photography.<br />The design of this camera is simply beautiful.  Gorgeous gun-metal aluminum body, solid zoom lens with built-in cap, simple button and menu layout, and overall, a very durable camera.<br />As this was my first ditial camera, I quickly learned the limitations of the unit.  Some of the limitations can be corrected through simple upgrades, namely, the 16MB SD card included with the unit is not adequate for most users.  You should get a 64MB or 128MB card so you can save more than 80 shots at a time.  In fact, with a 128MB SD card, you can shoot over 170 photos at high resolution.  It might be all the storage you're going to need with a simple camera like this.  Also, I recommend getting the deluxe leather case with belt-clip (available from Kyocera or other camera shops), as the pouch included with this camera will not provide enough protection - even for such a durable device.<br />This camera competes with the Canon Elph and other \"credit card\" sized cameras (the front of this camera is precisely the size of a credit or ATM card).  And it competes with them very well.  The resolution is incredible, and the optical zoom is rock-solid.  However, using the digital zoom does result in a loss of resolution (which may not be known to first-time digital users).  And this camera has useful manual exposure and CCD sensitivity seetings, but no true ISO or \"traditional\" shutter speed adjustment.  Also, this camera does not perform well in low-light or in taking shots of fast-moving objects.  As much as I have experimented with its settings, it is obvious that this camera cannot do what the high-end digital cameras can do in twilight settings outdoor and dim settings indoor.  Even shots of hockey players on a brightly lit ice surface required precise manual adjustment (and a lot of patience).  This is a camera for daytime landscapes and close-ups of people and objects.  It cannot compete with digital SLR's or rangefinders costing twice as much (or more).  But having said that, I believe it is better than the Cannon Elph, and most other digital cameras of the same size.<br />Battery life is not spectacular.  If you use the flash for most shots, expect to re-charge the unit every 20-30 shots or so.  I even got a spare battery, just to be sure I was never caught without a charge for the flash.<br />The Kyocera S4 fills an interesting gap between the anonymous entry-level devices and the high-end units.  It's best feature might be that it packs 4 megapixels of resoultion into a form factor the size of a deck of playing cards.  That alone is a huge advantage.  Even worn on a belt, it is no more obtrusive than a cell phone.  If you need a camera that can fit in your bag and always be available without getting in the way, or if you need a camera for building a web site, selling items online, or just getting into digital photography, this is the only camera you'll need.<br />Now that I am happy with the Kyocera S4, I am ready to take ditial photography to the next level, and I think that will be the Leica 1 Digital.  It has many of the same features as the Kyocera S4, except that it has a larger LCD, a bigger lens (to let in more light), an ISO dial, and longer battery life.  But I expect to get thousands of quality shots with the Kyocera S4 regardless.  It is not just another point & shoot camera.  It is a great value.","The Kyocera Finecam S4 is a truly remarkable little point-and- shoot.  I am a serious photographer, owner of high-end Canon film cameras and \"L\" lenses (not used since buying the Kyocera S4).<br />It is a point and shoot, rather than a professional camera, but the resolution is incredible, even at the lowest (normal) setting.<br />I have had no problems with battery life, although that is a common complaint (I use the onboard flash and LCD screen nearly all the time).  It is packed with features (i.e. exposure compensation, manual override on just about everything, self-timer, red-eye reduction, etc.)<br />The color has been just phenomenal.  I have had it for about three months and am extremely satisfied and am thinking about buying the S5 when it appears. I recommend getting at least a 64-meg. card, rather than the skimpy 16-meg card provided.<br />The LCD screen is hard to see during bright sun, but you have the option of using the viewfinder.  In low light, there is a delay while device meters and focuses, but this is true of all cameras. It could mean missing the shot--but you don't have to wait for your film to come back to know you missed it.  I am addicted to the instant feedback. It has made me a better photographer.<br />The video function is low-end, but basic. No audio, but if you want a video camera, buy one, rather than compromise a good digital still camera like this one.  It is tiny and fits on a belt not unlike a beeper.  I am never without my little companion and feel naked when it is not on my belt.  For the convenience, the size and the features it is packed with, you can not do better in my opinion.<br />Ron Gollobin--Oct. 2002","This Kyocera S4 is a really compact little camera, with the great 4 MB resolution.  The controls are pretty easy to use, but of course sometimes a little tough due to the small size.  But in a high quality dig cam like this, i really wanted the ability to take good little video clips.  The video clips on this cam 1) have NO AUDIO and 2) are very low resolution.  For my money, I think I'll consider the Sony P9, Minolta F100, or Olympus D40.  If all you need is stills, this is a great little cam.","I got the Kyocera S4 back in January 2003.

If you need a camera that can fit in your bag and always be available without getting in the way, or if you need a camera for building a web site, selling items online, or just getting into digital photography, this is the only camera you'll need.<br />Now that I am happy with the Kyocera S4, I am ready to take ditial photography to the next level, and I think that will be the Leica 1 Digital.  It has many of the same features as the Kyocera S4, except that it has a larger LCD, a bigger lens (to let in more light), an ISO dial, and longer battery life.  But I expect to get thousands of quality shots with the Kyocera S4 regardless.  It is not just another point & shoot camera.  It is a great value.","The Kyocera Finecam S4 is a truly remarkable little point-and- shoot.  I am a serious photographer, owner of high-end Canon film cameras and \"L\" lenses (not used since buying the Kyocera S4).<br />It is a point and shoot, rather than a professional camera, but the resolution is incredible, even at the lowest (normal) setting.<br />I have had no problems with battery life, although that is a common complaint (I use the onboard flash and LCD screen nearly all the time).  It is packed with features (i.e. exposure compensation, manual override on just about everything, self-timer, red-eye reduction, etc.)<br />The color has been just phenomenal.  I have had it for about three months and am extremely satisfied and am thinking about buying the S5 when it appears. I recommend getting at least a 64-meg. card, rather than the skimpy 16-meg card provided.<br />The LCD screen is hard to see during bright sun, but you have the option of using the viewfinder.  In low light, there is a delay while device meters and focuses, but this is true of all cameras. It could mean missing the shot--but you don't have to wait for your film to come back to know you missed it.  I am addicted to the instant feedback. It has made me a better photographer.<br />The video function is low-end, but basic. No audio, but if you want a video camera, buy one, rather than compromise a good digital still camera like this one.  It is tiny and fits on a belt not unlike a beeper.  I am never without my little companion and feel naked when it is not on my belt.  For the convenience, the size and the features it is packed with, you can not do better in my opinion.<br />Ron Gollobin--Oct. 2002","This Kyocera S4 is a really compact little camera, with the great 4 MB resolution.  The controls are pretty easy to use, but of course sometimes a little tough due to the small size.  But in a high quality dig cam like this, i really wanted the ability to take good little video clips.  The video clips on this cam 1) have NO AUDIO and 2) are very low resolution.  For my money, I think I'll consider the Sony P9, Minolta F100, or Olympus D40.  If all you need is stills, this is a great little cam."]},{"name":"Sony Mavica CD250","amazon_reviews":["Used for replacement parts for an older camera","This is the second one that I owned,  first one that I bought I loved it, after my first camera stop working I decided to get another one which I did not regret","I've owned this camera since 2002, and it's still great.

I was told once that I should be a professional photographer!!! - HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA!!","This summer while I was in a canoe taking pictures of my daughter, she accidently tipped us over. Here I am in a cold mountain lake with my Mavica and I think my camera is ruined. Well when I got home I dried the camera out for a week and cleaned out the lenses. Put in a new battery and the thing ACTUALLY WORKED and has been taking great pictures for the past four months. For something that is not rated as water resistant, I was surprised by the hardiness of the camera.<br /> Complex as it may seem, this is no wuss of hardware.","This is very easy to use and gives top quality pictures. I wish I had bought one much sooner.","Have used this camera in my classroom for the past year, picture quality better than any other camera in the school.  Easy to use by studetns and teacher.  Love the ease of CD storage","These Mavicas are the best in my book.  They are easy to use, take excellent pictures and record to disks that are cheap and durable.  What more do you need?<br />I love the fact that you can nearly take it from the box and figure the camera out on your own.  The effects that you can use are really fun and look good.  I've bought 5 of these for work, and they are shared among about 35 people comprising all levels of computer and camera literacy.  They are pretty durable, and everyone has been able to figure them out.","The Mavica CD-250 is a great little camera.  For the professional it is a complete solution.  For the amateur it falls just short of being a complete solution, due to the badly executed software that comes with it.<br />Although I got this camera mere hours before leaving on a professional assignment, Day One I was fully productive. Despite the fact this is my first digital camera I learned how to make it do everything I wanted with hardly any tears or frustration. At the end of the day I was solidly sold on digital photography. (Good thing, considering the bucks I had invested!)<br />I bought this camera to be a high-end point-and-shoot unit. The 2 MegaPixel resolution is perfectly adequate for any kind of snapshot photography.<br />The CD-R drive was a feature I decided I HAD to have. CD-R discs are SO cheap they can be used as throw-aways. I could carry gigabytes worth of storage with me for a twenty-dollar investment. Their versatility and portability makes them vastly superior to the memory-chips other digital cameras use. And they are great as an archival storage medium -- much like having the negatives from a conventional photo shoot.<br />One major advantage of shooting on CD-R discs is you can have several disks in use at one time, each one devoted to a different subject.  It's not like film where removing a partially-used roll and reloading it at a later date is tricky and risky.  Since you can 'Finalize' a CD-R many times you can store several 'shoots' on one disc.  Each time you 'Finalize' a disk you do waste some storage space, but CD-R's are so cheap it costs you pennies at most.  The convenience in helping to keep your shots organized is well worth the cost.<br />A feature of the Mavica I have only just learned to use is the zoom/pan/scan ability of the camera's display screen.  Because you can zoom a stored image on the display, you can see any piece of your shot at high resolution.  This is extremely handy in making sure you've gotten a properly focused image, and that the detail you wanted was actually captured.  It's much, much more convenient than having a PC standing by so you can check your images on a high-pixel-count screen.<br />I had posted an earlier version of this review that complained about the InfoLithium battery fully discharging in less than a week while the camera sat idle.  Whatever caused that problem has not recurred.  The battery DOES discharge slowly, as the manual says, but it has been losing only minutes of charge per week.  The manual does suggest removing the battery if you are going to store the camera for a while.  But if you are going to use the camera every week or three, this shouldn't be necessary.<br />There may have been something I left turned on that flattened the battery faster than normal.  To date I have not figured out what that might have been.<br />One concern remains -- the software that comes with the Mavica CD-250. As a digital photography newbie I find it incomprehensible. There is no manual. There are no on-screen prompts. Not even a 'Read Me' file. There are just a bunch of icons that offer no explanations as to what they are or what they do. A quick-start pamphlet would be a major improvement. But frankly, I'll go shopping for some better software rather than try to deal with a package that was so clearly an ill-designed afterthought.<br />My advice. If you are looking for a point-and-shoot digital camera the Mavica CD-250 should be on your short list. It is a versatile camera made even better by the CD-R recording system.  The software is a throw-away, but then there are lots of excellent aftermarket software packages available at all levels of sophistication and pricing.  Your PC should not need any additional software to display, file or transmit your photos.  Shop for better aftermarket software at your convenience.<br />Ed Bianchi","This camera is awesome. The pictures are crisp. The ability to see them as you take them is easy. You can easily hook the camera up to a TV is 5 seconds to show everyone or you can hook it up to your computer and print pictures in less than a minute. I have taken up to 134 pictures on one disc at 1600x1200 image size. You can also shoot movies with this camera. Not to mention that discs go for only $0.50 each so you can have bunches of these and not have to download everything on you computer. Memory cards with less memory than one disc cost $80.00 each.<br />Thanks---->Dean Wathen","If you want a versatile and functional digital camera that gives<br />you unlimited storage this is the one. The 3\" CD .jpg storage format can be read on any computor with cdrom drive.  You are not<br />limited to usb although it too is available.  Print out with a standard printer useing photo paper is good through excellent!  I've done portrait work with it as well as landscape, and have been very satisfied with the results.<br />The storage media is resonably priced and available.  A package of ten cd-r's is under [$$] at [local stores].  The function menu is resonably easy to understand and use. It does well with landscapes, snapshots of the grandkids, portraits and doe's very well with closeups.  I've used it to record and print documents as well.<br />The only draw back I've found is the auto-focus delay and the record delay, which is common with most auto-focus cameras and digital; And I would like to see an add-on  telephoto lens for longer shots; though the 2x3 optical,digital zoom does quite well.  I have recommended this unit to several people as a first camera for snapshots, landscapes or portraits.","The main advantage of this camera is its memory format: a mini-CD you can just put into your computer's CD-ROM player for easy downloading of pics onto your PC, plus each [$$} disk can hold a lot more pics than most overpriced Memory Stick.<br />Disadvantages: bulky (same size and weight as normal SLR camera), no viewfinder, the functions are not easy to adjust (Pentax and Canon still win the easy-to-use contest, and the lens is a mediocre no-name with the Sony label stamped on it.<br />My recommendation is pay a little more for the same Sony disk-style digital cameras that come with the German lenses (I think Carl Zeiss or something like that) if you don't mind the bulk and like the disk format, otherwise Panasonic has a good digital camera for about the same price with a Leica lens and one extra megapixel (3.0 total) resolution.","This is an awesome camera for families and those who just love to take pictures.  I prefer the CD because dealing with downloading from a memory stick is time consuming unless you're downloading to a laptop.<br /><br />I prefer the CD.  This camera isn't all that heavy.  In fact, I've not put it down since UPS brought it to my door.  I'm constantly capturing pictures of my two small sons.<br /><br />I don't have to say WE'RE OUT OF FILM anymore.  I prefer this camera to memory sticks because I like the idea of inserting a CD to just grab what I want.  There are no cords to plug in and pull out each time.<br /><br />It's 2 megapixels, and that' really enough for me.  You can shoot in several different modes, black and white, and even four different sizes.  I don't miss having a viewfinder either.  In fact, the LCD screen makes taking pictures that much more fun.<br /><br />Finally, what I most enjoy about this camera is being able to record short movies (sound and every movement) in crisp, clear color.<br /><br />I'll be sending our Christmas skits to family on the east coast easily this year.  This camera is worth the money you'll put into it.  You can get a really great deal on it in a lot of places.  Shop around, and if you purchase by Jan.  you can get your fifty dollar rebate.<br /><br />Happy shooting.","... I like the ease of use, I can view the pictures as I take them and delete them if I want. With the included cables I can view the pictures on my TV or download through a USB port. I have been happy with the battery life, I did buy an additional AC charger, and a 2nd battery($...). Normally you use a cable to charge the battery in the camera. It tells you in the viewfinder about how long you have left on the battery in minutes of useable life. I would not hessitate to recommend this camera to any one, at 2.0 +/- megapixel it takes great quality pics and movies. Buy the big carry case for all the extra cables and stuff.","Don't miss this camera.  This is the greatest camera.  Everyone I ever shown this camera to has loved it and some has even brought it.  It has everything that a person who is not a pro would want!!!!  The CD is easy to do, transfer, and send pictures.  The resolution, even at the lowest setting, is great. The CD could hold as many as 640 pictures.  One of the wonderful features is having a different CD for every group of picture I take to keep them organized. (For example, family, band, church etc.)","We recently purchased the Sony CD250 to use along with our 35mm on a trip out of the country for a wedding. Both families had camcorders and digital cameras along with some 35's. Our digital pictures turned out so great we are busy printing copies for other people.<br />We love the capacity of the CD's, the life of the battery charge, the zoom and preview features and the general ease of use both taking pictures and printing or emailing them.<br />We are not \"great photographers\" but, with this camera, that doesn't keep us from having \"great photos\".","Don't be fooled into thinking this camera is easily compatible with a Macintosh. You cannot read the CD's on a SuperDrive. You cannot read the CD's on a Mac running anything prior to OS X. I am still looking for a fix for this, but as of this time I am not able to use the CD's on my old PowerBook, which unfortunately does not have a USB port either. I like using the camera, though.","This is my first digital camera and I am glad I waited.  I am just an average guy who had always used a basic 35mm for vacation & family photos and, while I had considered digital cameras for quite some time  - I was not quite convinced and was somewhat confused by the variety of cameras and storage media.  This camera changed my mind and convinced me that \"digital\" is the way to go.<br />  While the Sony CD-250 is not the top of the line in terms of ghee-whiz features, for a non-technical person I have found it to be just superb.  The CD's (CD-R & CD-RW) are durable and have more than ample storage, the camera is easy to use, it produces great shots, has a solid feel (same size as a typical 35mm camera) and has a good battery life.  Downloading and attaching photos to e-mail or posting to the Sony photo site is quite easy.  In short, I am very pleased.<br />  In my opinion, for the casual camera user who has been considering a digital camera, take a look at the the Sony CD series of cameras - I think you will be pleased.","I am a professional radiographer and photographer (25 years now) and I used both the CD400, CD300, as<br />  well as a Nikon Coolpix for this year's field research season x-raying mummies in Peru. This means the cameras<br />  were pushed hard.....blowing sand, huge contrast ranges, high resolution radiographs needed, fast manual<br />  control of radical light conditions, etc.....essentially most of the tough conditions and imaging requirements you<br />  can imagine. Here's what I found:<br />  The Sony Mavica CD300 beat them all. It's not the most expensive or the best resolution but we all thought it<br />  did the best job.<br />  Mavica CD400: best resolution but extremely slow recording time made it impossible to work with most of the<br />  time....the CD300 often got 3-4 shots while the 400 was recording one.<br />  Mavica CD300: not the best resolution, but now that I've done some prints for publication from it's highest res<br />  setting I will not be buying any more 400s....just not a significant enough difference, plus it's not as heavy or<br />  bulky.<br />  Nikon Coolpix: not in the running by comparison with the Sonys....although it is more lightweight....we are<br />  buying mini CDs for 33 cents each in bulk... and getting 140-180 high res images per CD.....they are so easy to<br />  format, initialize, and copy on any CD burner that I can't believe we even considered using memory stiks, or<br />  USB downloads.<br />  The best features are common to both the Sony Mavica CD300 and 400 series though.....manual control of the<br />  images, excellent close up abilities, decent wide angle (which can be enhanced with add-on lenses if necessary),<br />  and both rapid video and automatic functions with night focusing for flash, etc., etc.<br />  Finally! There is a great digital camera.","This is one of my more favorite cameras. I personally have the MVC-CD300 however this camera has nothing to laugh about.<br />It's 2MP resolution makes it ideal for both printing on glossy of matte finishings, granted it does have a little graininess here and there however most digital cameras do until it reaches anything past 4MP. It is also ideal for internet usage, the pictures it saves are not to big for a dial-up user to download if you send them an e-mail with picture attachments taken by this camera.<br />It's 3x optical zoom lens is standerd for most digital cameras and I was never fond of digital zoom since it really is not a zoom anyway.<br />Naturely I love the cd option the best. Even though the cd size is half of that of a regular cd, it will still fit in ANY computer cd tray so you don't have to worry about compatibility.  The only compatibility you have to worry about is if your computer can support both video and jpeg files alike.<br />The cds are very cost effective. A 156mb cd can cost anywhere between [amt] and [amt]. This may seem a lot for a cd however when you consider the fact that a compact flash, smart media or SD card with a 128mb card can cost between [amt] and [amt], it really seems like a deal, and the CD-RWs naturaly are reusable.<br />It also has the movie taking feature which I love entirely. My Dad recorded my entire High School graduation ceremony with one cd. Granted the resolution was not top notch but when you consider the fact that you can record over an hour of footage non-stop and potentialy burn it onto a DVD (depending on what burner you have) the possibilities with this camera are endless."]},{"name":"Sony Mavica CD400","amazon_reviews":["Excellent product, excellent service by the seller.

In my two years of taking pictures with this camera, I have only used the fully automatic still picture mode and the simple movie mode.  I've yet to have a bad shot.  Part of what makes shooting pictures with this camera so easy is the fact that it has the large viewing window to let the user see just about exactly what the picture will look like.<br /><br />This camera has a fairly quick auto-focus feature that is highly reliable except in extreme low-light conditions, and even then it can usually compensate for the lack of light by using the built-in diamond pattern lamp used for helping the camera focus.  Where this tool starts to fail is for objects more than six feet away, depending on lighting.<br /><br />Although the camera has a note that it displays on power-up any time it detects a non-Sony Mavica CD installed in the storage bay, I've never had any problem using other discs.  Typically I use the Memorex 210 MB CD-R's.<br /><br />With these discs, I can store 95 pictures at the highest JPEG resolution, or 954 pictures at the lowest resolution.  For the movie mode, the same disc will yield 8 minutes and 31 seconds at the highest resolution (which isn't that great at 320 HQX) or 100 minutes at 160 by 112 resolution, which is actually pretty crappy video.  But if you want a camcorder, this is not the toy for you.<br /><br />The camera can also store images in TIFF format, but be prepared to wait a while for the images to save to the disc, and to change the discs often.  Only 13 images will fit on a 210 MB disc in this format.  For anyone who isn't interested in professionally working with their photos, the JPEG format is fine.  I've printed out many of those prints at 8x10 with remarkable detail.<br /><br />Some of the extra features of this camera include the photo effects, such as black and white or negative (can't quite figure out what I might want to do with that one, but it's there nonetheless) and a red-eye reduction flash.  The red-eye reduction takes a little bit more work than I would like to turn on and off (rotating the selector knob to \"SET UP\" and navigating a couple of options then back again), but it isn't that much of a pain and can be done in about 5 seconds.  Also the user can select a \"confirm before write\" option, to avoid wasting space on the disc for those who have a habit of taking a picture with their thumb over the lens or something.<br /><br />Another feature of the camera is to stamp the image with a date/time stamp.  I don't know why anyone would really want to do this, since the time and date are also imbedded in the file (along with other data such as ISO speed, focal length, flash, and exposure time) and can be retrieved by loading the disc into a computer CD-ROM drive.<br /><br />Battery life is usually quite good.  I can typically use mine for an entire event (football game, wedding, etc.) without worrying about the battery, although the internal monitor might be telling me that it's low toward the end if I've been doing a lot of reviewing.<br /><br />One of the drawbacks I've read in another review of this product is that sometimes using the camera to review the images stored on the disc can be painfully slow.  While it is slower than using a memory stick model, it isn't that bad.  Add the advantage of accessing all of the images very quickly using a PC (even before the disc is finalized by the camera) and the usefulness of this method becomes clear.  Transfers from a CD are substantially faster than transfers via USB or Firewire.<br /><br />I have a Canon EOS Digital Rebel now which I use most of the time and love, but I'm not getting rid of this great little Sony.  Partly because my girlfriend loves it and it's kind of her camera now (she's laid claim to it), but also because it is still so useful and so good that I see no reason to.","This is the best digital camera I have ever used. I have even bought a spare camera (MVC-CD400 it is sitting quietly in its box) just incase I where to ever break it beyond repair ;)<br />Ya its that Sweet!!!<br />Brandon","This camera was a gift. I don't know much about digital cameras except that whenever I have used one, the pictures always seem very grainy. I never understood why people would use them over regular cameras, except for the online uses. Having said all that, I must now admit that I love this camera. The picture quality is excellent, and I love being able to see my pictures on the computer and choosing which ones I want on paper. My only complaint (minor) is the view screen. When you are outside, it is difficult to see what you are aiming for.","Not only does it take awesome photos but this camera is great for short MPEG movies. I copy them right off the CD to my hard drive and then import into Windows Movie Maker for editing. The movies have better quality than my TRV27 Sony Camcorder.","I have owned my CD400 for nearly one year.  I have never been disappointed with capabilities, quality, user-friendliness, or results.  This is a fantastic all-round camera.  Use Sony discs, as recommended.  Other media is unreliable.","I recently purchased my first digital camera.  A big step for someone involved in taking photos for over 40 years. I purchased the Sony Mavica CD 400--what a great choice. It has the feel of an SLR, has the ability to add equipment-similar to that used with my SLR cameras, and the ability to view the pictures immediately.  It also has many great features included in the initial packaging---everything to start!! I like the idea of the mini CD for picture storage, and multiple ways to download the pics taken.  I will continue to use my 2 SLR cameras, but like the challenge of this new, fun digital camera.<br />Jackie N<br />New Hampshire","You have read the rave reviews about this camera and I completely agree with them. This is a most excellent digi cam to travel with. But it has a few limitations which can be very annoying to some photographers.<br />My experience with this camera involves a 6 month stay in Thailand where I used it extensively. I also used a Cannon Rebel 2000 with 28-80 stock lense and a Quantary 70-300 W/macro lense, plus an Olympus p/s zoom all weather camera. From the thousands of shots I took, here is my opinion:<br />The Sony's resolution is much greater than the 35mm counterparts. This makes for much more satisfying large prints (8x10++). This is most important for landscapes and sunset shots. But I found a few limitations.<br />For sunsets, I found that the Sony created fuzzy shots of the sun during a sunset when the sun was still a bit high, where the standard Cannon Rebel 2000 delivered crisp views of the sun's orb - much more satisfying. Maybe it's just a limitation of the digital sensor/VS standard film, but a limitation nonetheless. As the sun sank lower, the Sony photos were better. The best sunset pictures I took were with the Sony, but only after a brightness threshold was passed.(I used a filter on Sony equal to -1.5 stops)<br />One other limitation of the Sony is the exposure time. It is limited to 8 seconds. This is OK for most applications, but I wanted more. 8 seconds is very limited when I want to shoot static nighttime shots. Many pictures came out OK(excellent, actually), but I lust for the unlimited (bulb) setting of the Cannon Rebel 2000 . This is not available with the Sony.<br />Also, the Zoom is limited, and I like interchangable lenses, which is impossible with the Sony. That limits my shot selection.<br /><br />Using ISO 400 can be unproductive(noise!), but still satisfactory for night snapshots with flash.<br />The Sony is a GREAT camera for the regular user, excellent for travel, and fun for the more inventive photographer (full manual mode).<br />But it's limitations can hinder the more serious photographer who is looking for professional results.","I recently went on a whale-watching trip in Monterey.  We didn't see many whales, but we saw thousands of dolphins.  They would pop up out of nowhere and everyone was snapping away with their cameras trying frantically to capture the action. People using film gave up after a few minutes since the cost was prohibitive.  People using memory stick cameras quickly used up their memory and spent the rest of their time reveiwing and deleting photos to make room for more.  After shooting almost 100 photos at maximum resolution (JPG) using my Mavica CD400, I simply swapped out the disc and shot 100 more.  The CDR's are so cheap that I didn't have to worry about taking bad shots. When all was said and done, I had about 15 excellent images out of the nearly 200 that I shot.  I'm sure that I was the only one that walked off the boat with anything other than pictures of the water.<br />Image quality is excellent.<br />You can shoot video with sound until the CDR runs out of room.<br />Many useful features that are easy to access.<br />Battery life is sufficient for 200+ photos<br />Over-priced, but incredibley convenience...worth the investment","I studied every camera out there and found this camera has the best features for me. This camera has a built in cd burner which allows you to store a ton of pictures and movies. The CD's are inexpensive to buy and easy to share, save and store. The quality is excellent.","I simply love this camera!  So easy to use, great resolution, no film, CD hold lots of high quality shots!  I printed some pics from the first day and Sony Imagestation suggested enlargements 20x30 in size as the maximum! ...","Best I've ever seen so far for clearity, ease of use and ability to edit or modify pictures with photo software.  Truly enjoy this one, especially the automatic focus, flash, and transfer to my desktop.  I'll never use all the space on the cd and if I do, big deal, less than 50 cents a piece for a new cd-r.  My photo paper costs more.","I just bought my new toy and I love it. I have several different types of cameras to include digital. This is the best one I have had the pleasure of using. I take photography seriously and so did sony when the designed this camera. I was incredilbly impressed with the results of the sepia photo's taken with this camera. They were right on target. I have used my camera allot in the few days that I have owned it. I am still finding more and more items and options that are great. I have read that people think it is a little big. I think they need to think back to the first digital cameras and thank sony for this one.","I am a trades person and I take alot of before and after pictures. It's nice to be able to get good shots the first time out. I can't tell you many times I've taken usless pictures of jobs that I could use for future work.","I am a trades person and I take alot of before and after pictures. It's nice to be able to get good shots the first time out. I can't tell you many times I've taken usless pictures of jobs that I could use for future work.","I am new to digital photography.  After doing internet research, this is the camera that I selected to purchase.  It is feature packed, easy to use, and takes beautiful pictures.  I highly recommend this camera.","I formerly used a point and shoot 1.3 MP camera that had no LCD screen.  I am absolutely amazed at the capabilities of this camera and it continues to impress me.  The battery is robust.  The discs have ample room for recording an entire vacation (about 200 pictures).  The \"movie\" mode is a bit primitive and I wish I could have more control over bracketing exposures.  I also think the time delay between pictures (because they are \"recorded\" on the cd) makes this not a good choice for the action or sports photographer.  I spent some fun time this morning with my wife and kids looking at pictures fed from the camera onto the TV screen as a \"slide show\"!","I am an amateur photographer in Florida, and this camera gets incredible wildlife shots and adjusts to all light conditions with excellent color. Saving photos on CDs is SO much better than dealing with memory sticks that only hold a few photos, as I can get 170 shots on a CD at the HIGHEST RESOLTUION, and the CDs are cheap too. It comes with a CD adapter that lets you slip it into your CD drive, but frankly, the adapter is a pain as you have to put the CD in it JUST SO. I use the USB port it comes with instead, and it is much faster. The camera is a little bulkier than most, but it is so well designed, I don't care. The is the first camera I am in love with!","One of my greatest problems with digital cameras was that I wasn't good about saving copies on removable media.  This camera starts by burning my picture to a mini-cd and I love it.  It is as feature rich and quick as my other Sony camera.  It's buffer is large enough that I've never felt a slow down in my picture speed.  Just a great camera.","Having upgraded from the Sony Mavica FD73, the CD400 was quite a jump!  Big 4.0 megapixel pictures, with lots of adjustable settings make this camera hard to beat.  The only downside is no zooming in on videos (but you can set the zoom beforehand), but then again, you bought this for its still camera capabilities, and not its video capabilities, right?  It will even autofocus in complete darkness.","This is a great camera.  With the CD in the camera all you have to do is take it out and pop it into the computer.  No hooking up a docking station, no buying memory sticks that are tiny and easy to loose.  I can use this camera and download to our computer with no help from my husband.<br />I am an avid scrapbooker and I have found that this camera has saved a fortune in developing pictures that I would have never used anyway.  I love being able to decide weather or not I like the shot right away.  No getting home from a Disney vacation and finding out everyone had their eyes closed in the great shot with Mickey.  You can take several shots quickly and delete the ones that you don't like right there, and on to the next attraction.  No more spending $16 to get double prints and a CD.  You can take well over 100 pictures and decide from the camera what you like.  Plus you have everything saved on a CD already. You can then take it to a developer and have what you want printed, or upload to Shutterfly and never have to worry about going back to the store for pick up.<br />This is the perfect camera for those of us who have wanted an upgraded camera with all the bells and whistles and could not, and didn't want to spend hours learding how to work everything.  A quick read through the book and you are ready to go.","Great camera. Easy to use for beginner and enough to make a pro happy. Very thoughtful to use CD's for storage medium - very convenient, efficient, and love the DD R/W flexibility.<br />Only wish would be to have a variet of auto settings like many of the Nikon series.","Let me first start of by saying that this camera is probably not for everyone.  I'll start of by describing its short coming, all of which I think is something that is expected.<br />Firstly, its bulky.  Not big, maybe the size of a 35MM not as heavy though, but definitely much bigger than your average Digital camera.  This of course is due to the fact that it uses CD as storage device.  Sony did a nice job of putting a hand grip on the right side of the Camera that fit nicely in my hand.  But I think that perhaps left-handers and people with smaller hand might not feel as comfortable with this camera.  I would recommend going to a local store and try it out before buying it online.<br />Secondly, since it uses CD as storage, there will be lag time in disc access.  Reading from disc or reviewing images are slow (very slow).  And definitely for me the worst part of this camera.  Taking pictures at regular interval (2-3 sec between shot) is ok since the camera stores the pictures into a memory buffer first before writing onto the disc.  But you will have problem if you want to take lots of shots on fast moving object.  The camera provides a mode for 3 burst shot or a multi burst mode for up to 16 shots (stored in 1 picture) but its not very good, you are probably better off with another camera.  But again, this is something I was expecting from this camera.<br />Now to the good part.  Of course the CD storage is great.  The main reason I brought this camera is because I went on a 2 weeks vacation and didn't want to carry lab top around to off load my pictures.  The CD storage are cheap, and allows me to take highest quality pictures at all times.  I recomend using Memorex 210MB pocket CD-R for this (stores about 96 pic on highest quality).  Much better than sony mavica standard CDR, and cheaper too.  Furthermore, the CDR makes filing away pictures much easier.  You don't have to store it onto a harddrive or burn the image afterward onto CDRs.  Its probably would be convinence to be able to come back and look at the pictures 2-3 years from now.<br />Another important thing is that the camera just simply takes great pictures.  The pictures come out real nice, and with its autofocus feature its almost impossible to shot out of focus pictures, unless of course you use the manual setting.  You can add effect to the pictures (solarize, BW, Sepia, Negative Art) and also adjust the white balance...the usual stuff.  And the Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar lens works real well.<br />Sony probably realizes that the Camera is bulky and thus they actually put alot of features into the device (at least the 4 megapixels version) comparing to their other 4 megapixels camera DSC-P9.  You can adjust the camera to Manual that allow you to adjust various stuff like Shutter speed, Aperture, exposure shift.  Overall this, and the image quality, is the biggest different between the 2 megapixel and the 4 megapixel Mavica.<br />The camera has a movie mode which record the movie (with voice)onto the disc in mpg format.  On an empty disc this its about 5 min recording time on best quality and 90 min on lowest quality.  Its no substitution for camcorder though because zoom doesn't work under this mode.  But its a nice little feature nontheless.  Note that lots of Digital camera has this feature, but not all of them allow you to record movie up to the maximum capacity of the media.  Many digital camera limits you to a certain fixed time (usually less than 1 min) of recording time.<br />Battery life is decent.  The camera display the exact battery life remaining in minutes.  It definitely is enough for normal operation for 1 day, before its nightly recharged.  The recharging doesn't take too long, 1-2 hours.  You can buy a backup battery/charger if you takes lots of pictures.<br />Overall I really recommend this camera for people who like to take pictures.  Its not your typical digital camera so it definitely is not for everyone and you should be cautious when buying it.  Go to a store try it out first.  But I do tell you this, if you are thinking about buying the MVC-CD250 vs. MVC-CD400...go with the 400.  Its more expensive, but its a much bigger bang for the buck.","I've used this camera over the past several years and I remain a true believer of both it, and its updated 5MP version, which I also own.  The expanse of capabilities and options with the camera allows for taking excellent pictures under nearly any conditions.  The manual as well as the shutter and aperature priority imaging modes allow you complete control over the imaging process.  I've taken pictures of everything including northern lights at 2 a.m., my cats in near complete darkness, portrait shots of subjects in dark rooms standing in front of bright windows, and they've all turned out wonderfully.  For printing, I've used both my home printer, and a professional photo store, and prints up to 11x14 have turned out perfectly with no degredation at all.<br /><br />Several recommendations if you buy this camera.  Don't waste your money on Sony's cd-r disks.  I've used verbatim, memorex and k-hypermedia cd-r with no problem.  They're certainly much cheaper, and they all hold 185 MB while the Sony's only hold 156 MB.  I would also suggest that you buy the Sony external flash for the camera.  While the hot shoe will accept other brands of flash, I've been very impressed with the improvements to my pictures since buying the sony flash.  I would also recommend buying a small (3-6\") expandable tripod that will fit in any case.  This allows you to set up longer exposure shots for dark environments, as well as for using the timer function on less than ideal surfaces.<br /><br />If you're looking for huge storage (and archive) capabilities, excellent images, and complete control over your picture taking (minues the zoom limitations), then this is certainly the camera for you.  Everyday I think it is worth the price I've paid, and with a new baby in the house when first purchased, being able to take several hundred pictures in the first few days and email the \"best-of\" off to the grandparents is certainly a plus.","I have this camera and love it.  It takes great pics, has more options than I need.<br />The only downfall is the fact that there is no zoom in video mode.  I had the older Sony Mavica (that recorded to floppy's) and it did have zoom, so I didn't even think about this one not having zoom.<br />Other than that, it's great.","We looked at the 2megapixel versions that were out plus the 22X zoom cd mavica before purchasing this particular model.  Had there been a zoom version upgrade with the cd rather than the memory sticks, we probably would have purchased it because we liked the zoom feature so much.  We wanted 4 megapixel with the cd option, which left us with this camera.  Having had access to use all 3 cd mavica cameras, we chose this one because the zoom isn't bad, the Zeiss lenses are great and the options are all there.<br />After taking this on a trip to Washington DC, we used only 2 disks using 2nd from the highest resolution.  We also shot a few mpeg videos, which were an interesting endeavor.  Because it isn't a full camcorder, you cannot zoom in and out while making a video.  We didn't find this out until we filmed the changing of the guards at Arlington.  Also, at highest res, you only get 5 minutes 28 seconds of video.  The next step down gives about 28minutes.  All in all, it was great to only have to carry cd's and knowing what we know now, we can go completely high res on our next vacation and not have to worry about disk space.<br />Also, the functions on the camera allowed us to take pictures of items behind glass at the Smithsonian museums.  We could instantly see if we had a glare or not and the camera offers a few different ways to eliminate the glare completely.<br />Other than the \"wow, this is a different camera\" comments through airport security, we had little problem with it.  The battery life was impressive - 3 days before recharging.<br />If you want to do videos, we would recommend purchasing a separate unit that has more functionality, but it was great if you only wanted to carry one camera.","It is simply a marvel of technology and represents good value for money considering that it comes complete with a superb long-lasting Lithium-ion battery pack, International 110-240V 50/60Hz charger as standard for when you're travelling (you still have to buy adaptors to fit the sockets in other countries), and 156MB+ storage capacity on the CD-R/ CD-RW for about [price]. The camera and its' extensive features are easy to use after only a few hours of ownership. Slip the 3\"CD-R or CD-RW into most CD-ROM drives and immediately access your photos in Windows Explorer without the aggravation of cables and card readers. The only blemish is the meagre 3X optical zoom. For anybody in Europe where this camera sells for about [price] before adding 15 to 20% sales taxes to give an average retail price of about [price] , this camera is an especially great buy.<br />But the Sony is BIG! OK, it can't be any smaller than the 3\" CDs it uses for storage. But somewhere in Sony's system of R&D, having established that they had a superb product concept, nobody then passed on the design to the Sony boffins who specialize in miniaturizing everything. The result is simply that you have a great camera but which is simply GIGANTIC compared to anything else out there!<br />I should have spent more and bought a Fuji Finepix S602 with a 1GB IBM microdrive. Anybody want to swap?","I am a professional radiographer and photographer (25 years now) and I used both the CD400, CD300, as well as a Nikon Coolpix for this year's field research season x-raying mummies in Peru.  This means the cameras were pushed hard.....blowing sand, huge contrast ranges, high resolution radiographs needed, fast manual control of radical light conditions, etc.....essentially most of the tough conditions and imaging requirements you can imagine.  Here's what I found:<br />The Sony Mavica CD300 beat them all.  It's not the most expensive or the best resolution but we all thought it did the best job.<br />Mavica CD400: best resolution but extremely slow recording time made it impossible to work with most of the time....the CD300 often got 3-4 shots while the 400 was recording one.<br />Mavica CD300: not the best resolution, but now that I've done some prints for publication from it's highest res setting I will not be buying any more 400s....just not a significant enough difference, plus it's not as heavy or bulky.<br />Nikon Coolpix:  not in the running by comparison with the Sonys....although it is more lightweight....we are buying mini CDs for 33 cents each in bulk... and getting 140-180 high res images per CD.....they are so easy to format, initialize, and copy on any CD burner that I can't believe we even considered using memory stiks, or USB downloads.<br />The best features are common to both the Sony Mavica CD300 and 400 series though.....manual control of the images, excellent close up abilities, decent wide angle (which can be enhanced with add-on lenses if necessary), and both rapid video and automatic functions with night focusing for flash, etc., etc.<br />Finally!  There is a great digital camera.","The MVC-CD400 is a new model of Sony's established mini-CD burning cameras, along with the MVC-CD250, replacing the CD200 and CD300 models. So why would Sony need to upgrade anything you ask? I was actually asking myself the same thing at first. I was getting ready to drop down the money for a CD300 model when I heard a new design was coming out, so I started doing some research. I found that Sony has done a nice job of directly addressing many of the failings of the CD300/CD200 units, and added some especially nice touches to boot!<br />The most noticeable change up front is that the built-in flash unit has moved from the upper left side of the unit to right over the barrel. This helps with avoiding shadow effects when taking up-close shots.<br />Additionally, they have addressed the single most commented-upon flaw of the 200/300 series: Viewing the LCD screen in bright sunlit conditions. They have added a clear 'strip' along the top of the LCD panel that allows ambient light to help back-light the LCD screen, and the results are frankly good, making the LCD significant more usable in all lighting conditions without having to buy the 'viewfinder attachment' that Sony sells for the Mavica CD model cameras.<br />The third significant change is the addition of a standard flash adapter, allowing one to use external flash units with this camera for better lighting when needed. It is important to note - apparently it is critical to make sure you use a normal low voltage external flash instead of a studio-quality high-voltage unit, as this may damage the camera!<br />Like it's previous generation brothers, the CD400 includes a Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar lens for high quality (professional?) photography without the distortions you may sometimes find in the 'corners' of shots taken through some lower quality digital cameras. It also upgrades the CCD from 3.3 megapixels to 4.0 or so, which means even more detail can be captured for folks who are interested in capturing everything possible.<br />The other unique addition is Sony's Hologram AF system, which uses a laser emitting diode to put a crosshatch pattern on your target prior to snapping the shot, letting the autofocus get better accuracy when dealing with situations that sometimes confuse traditional autofocus routines.<br />Sony's batteries also are decent, giving a typical user 2+ hours of uninterrupted shooting before needing replacement, and then recharging in ~45 minutes.<br />And of course the mail selling feature for most folks, myself included - the photos are saved on mini-CDs, rather than one of the various memory stick/card units. Mini-CDs are dirt cheap per MB compared to memory sticks, and typically store ~150-200MB worth of photos, depending on make. Sony of course recommends you use only their branded disks, but many folks are reporting no problems using other manufactured brands. Depending on CD used, this translates into ~10 photos at the absolute maximum resolution (2272x1704 in TIFF format) and quality through ~1300+ photos at 640x480 at standard quality (JPG).<br />As an added feature, you can record movies with audio with the camera also, though the image and sound quality are not comparable with a digital video camera so if video is your passion, go look for a video camera, not a digital still camera. Otherwise, this is a nice little bonus.<br />I had resisted the urge to purchase a digital camera for a long time, waiting both for the photo quality to start approaching that which could be found with 35mm cameras, and for the means to get the pictures into a usable format on the PC to become cheaper or easier. Mini-CDs work in nearly all modern CD drives on computers, and I have not run across one yet that failed to work, though I admittedly tend to have relatively modern equipment at home and work. (Nothing older than ~3 years old at least in terms of CD drives.) The MVC-CD400 is an answer to every criticism I've had about digital cameras for the last few years.

Otherwise, this is a nice little bonus.<br />I had resisted the urge to purchase a digital camera for a long time, waiting both for the photo quality to start approaching that which could be found with 35mm cameras, and for the means to get the pictures into a usable format on the PC to become cheaper or easier. Mini-CDs work in nearly all modern CD drives on computers, and I have not run across one yet that failed to work, though I admittedly tend to have relatively modern equipment at home and work. (Nothing older than ~3 years old at least in terms of CD drives.) The MVC-CD400 is an answer to every criticism I've had about digital cameras for the last few years. I'm enjoying mine greatly!<br />ONE NOTE: Viewing 'unfinazlied' CDs on a Windows PC only works if you have DirectCD installed, which is an application that comes bundled with pretty much any CD burner on the market. 'Finalized' CDs are readable pretty much everywhere."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P31","amazon_reviews":["Entering my tenth year with this unit as my primary camera.

So, being able to make a second-hand purchase saved me a lot of money and I have been having a lot of fun with it. It's so small that I can literally take it everywhere with me.<br />In terms of battery use, the first thing I did was to purchase an additional 4 rechargibles and a battery charger that charges in less than 4 hours. So far, I have had to change them once in the last 3-4 weeks.<br />For the entry-level, cost-concious photographer, this is the one. I anticipate not having to upgrade until I graduate.","This is a cool camera for the bucks man, I have put mine through it's paces, and it works like it is still new, only thing, watch out for the cheap memory stick door, mine is still intact, but it feels so weak...ill bet one good drop or pull and it comes off in your hand, other than that, killer digital cam, it also makes a mean MPEG video if ya got a big memory stick.. good for sporting events,illegal street races,or whatever you can imagine:)","* Good Quality Pics<br />* Good Battery life<br />* Good features<br />Not so good:<br /><br />* Power button , Very Very small<br />* Button to delete and toggle between menus ( Feels like it is going to break)","For the price, fastest speed, lowest f-stops,best control, and best quality.  And Sony...","Pros:<br />Excellent value. Intuitive user interface. Laden with useful features without becoming confusing. Relatively light and compact. Decent image quality. Respectable battery life. Good display. Quick response time. Durable. No time limit for movie shots. Low noise for low light situations. Fixed lens has a slightly wider angle than most zoom lenses. Overall quality is excellent.<br />Cons:<br />Lens distortions makes portraits its weakness. The lens is on the soft side. Lack of zoom may be trouble for some, then there are those who can appreciate a fixed wide angle. Low light focusing can be a tad slow or inaccurate even with the focus assist light. No extra long shutters (only up to 2\"). For those who care, no sound with movie clips.<br />Conslusion:<br />This is a great snapshot camera. The simplicity and speed of its interface makes it a joy to use. Useful features at the touch of a button that both novice and advanced photographers will appreciate. Respectable battery life reduces the inhibition to joyfully snapping away, and the quality of its images did not disappoint. The robust body is durable and allows its use in less friendly conditions. I have used quite a few digital cameras from Nikon, Minolta, Sony, Canon and Olympus, yet none feels as \"willing\" as this camera to shoot pictures. The speed, quality, battery longevity, simplicity and durability of the camera allowed me personally to concentrate more on the photographs than on the gewgaws, delays or battery exhaustion. I have indeed shot an incredible amount of pictures with this camera, more than with all the other much more expensive cameras. The P31 is build for quick snapshots, with features that inspires creativity, and at a price that I can only love. A wonderfully balanced combination, if you can only overlook the lack of zoom.<br />Recommended:<br />128mb Memory Stick, Extra NiMH batteries. A quick charger.","I wont bore you with the same info as everyone else.<br />The camera is nice, BUT the pictures could be sharper.<br />Close up shots are nice, but farther away shots are not as sharp as they should be.<br />NO editing software is included, big bummer.<br />Batteries last very nicely, I get way over an hour with it on and taking shots.<br />Other than that it has nice features and easy to use.<br />Small and nicely built.<br />Check out other reviews on the net.<br />I would say its probably better than the 2.1 HP or Kodaks.<br />If you get it on sale, I would buy it.","Sony DSC-P31 digital camera is pretty simple to use. It comes with a 8Mb memory stick.I bought a 128Mb memory stick from Sandisk(much cheaper than Sony's memory sticks)and it works fine. Had no problem connecting it to the Computer or TV.The Flash is pretty powerful.I am quite happy that I bought this camera for [the price I paid]. I highly recommend this camera.","I bought this camera recently. It works great. Battery life is pretty good. I had no problem connecting to my computer or TV. The camera comes with a 8Mb memory stick. I bought a 128mb memory stick(sandisk). Sony memory stick costs $ Sandisk works as good as Sony. The flash is very powerful. It is not too hard to learn the controls of this Camera. I am quite satisfied with this digital camera.","A increadable price for 3 filming modes clip motion, regular filming, and slow motion.  This Camara also has a mode where if you are in dim light the picture will become brighter from the flash but it will not turn only some places bright.  This camara does not have sound or zoom for it's movies but you can change the color of the picture like black and white.  This camara has lots of other modes, but these are the top ones.","this is a great camera... if you are not a professional and are looking to buy some camera only for fun.. well this is your camera, just buy more memory, and aditional batteries (not necesary because it use a common alkaline AA batteries), it have a lot of funtions, and the only don't have a lot of diferences with the P71 is great for fun and travels i extremenly recomend tu buy this superior camera","I bought this after having used low end digital cameras.  Just a couple of months before I bought my Sony, I bought a 1 megapixel camera and was thrilled with the pictures I was getting, so I moved up to the Sony.  My first set of pictures were on a cloudy day.  They were sharp but nothing special.  Later I took pictures on a clear day and was blown away by the color.  Absolutely stunning.  There is no comparison between this camera and the others I was using.  I am still trying different buttons and learning what my camera is capable of but was up and taking pictures right away.  My only regret is that I didn't get an optical zoom.  I can tell the difference, but I don't use that feature much and am able to crop away any distracting objects and still have crisp photos.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who has been disappointed with the colors of their current photos.","I really like it. It's a great camera for the price I paid. Easy to use,  manual and automatic controls, very nice menus, great quality for slide shows on a TV, and even 640X480 images look good. Better that I spected.<br />The only thing I don't like is that I doesn't come with the AC adapter, so just get an extra set of batteries and buy more memory once it gets cheaper.","My first digital camera and it is great!  Everything I wanted.  I am very happy.","For the money, this is the best camera for a person who wants to get their feet wet in the world of Digital Photos. It is ready to shoot out of the box with no settings to mess with, but also has many adjustible settings to help make great pictures. It comes with all the accesories you need, but you should plan on getting at least a 32mb Memory Stick. Also, right now Sony is giving a $[money] instant credit for an accessory from their webiste when you register the camera. I used this to buy the Quick charger kit. This comes with an extra pair of NiMH batteries, Quick Charger, and custom camera case. with the discount, it is about [money]. The quick charger will charge 2 batteries in about an hour and a half, or 4 batteries in about 4 hours. The charger included with the camera takes 13 hours to charge 2 batteries, so this is a good investment. The camera is small and easy to hold in your hand. The LCD screen is not big but good enough to size up your photos. The movie mode is OK, no sound but cool for taking little clips. The Twlight modes are great, I have got some great dusk and night pictures using the twlight modes. Overall, After buying a Memory Stick and the Charger kit, I feel I got a great camera for under [money] total.","Im really happy with this digital camera... It tooks great pictures in the dark and its so easy to use... If you dont know what camera want to buy I really suggest this one.","The P31 is a great camera but  I have three complaints.<br />1) I am used to my old Canon AE1-P, in wich the camera body is made of metal.  My AE1-P camera is 17 years old, I doubt that the plastic body of the P31 will last that long.  Of course, it is much, much lighter.  You can carry it in a shirt pocket.<br />2) It has these two plastic tabs, one covering the AC input and the other covering the USB/Video Out connectors.  I am almost sure that before two years those fragile tabs will break.<br />3) Another contra is that it doesn't bring a camera case.  Sony includes the Ni-Mh batteries and charger but doesn't include even a...case?<br />Aside from that, as I said, this is a great snapshot camera.  If you keep the LCD turned off and don't use the flash frequently, the batteries should last long.  The included 8Mb memory stick is not enough, so buy a 128Mb stick with the camera.  I got a Lexar, and that is the one I use.  The 8Mb stick is gathering dust in a drawer.  I will buy another 128Mb stick when I go on vacations in the future.  The 2Megapixels images take about 800K each, so you can store about 150 to 160 images.<br />The manual says that the batteries take 13 hours to fully charge.  I don't know why they take that long, but I clocked them, and I was surprised to see that in fact, I took exactly 13 hours to charge them.  No less, no more.  If you take a lot of pictures, be prepared to buy 2 extra batteries also.<br />I was forgetting about my fourth complaint, the manual.  There's a mention that you have two USB modes, Normal and PTP.  They only say, you should use Normal.  No further explanation of what PTP is.<br />I did some research and found that PTP stands for Picture Transfer Protocol.  Windows XP understands it (I don't know if other versions do),  and basically instead of showing the camera as an external drive in the windows explorer, it activates a Wizard that makes it simpler for non technical users to transfer the images to a PC.<br />I prefer the \"Normal USB\" mode, but it would be nice if the manual explained all the features of the camera.","After much debate with myself, I orderd, and just received this camera.  May I say that it is a VERY nice camera.  The free 32meg memory stick is great, and Sony memory sticks are extremely fast.  At first, I was annoyed at the 13 hour charge time on the charger, but then realized that there is no law stating that Sony had to give a charger with the camera, so I take it as a gift and consider it to not be a factor in this review.  (As a side note however, a 4-hour charger with 4 batteries can be purchased at [local store] for [money]).<br />On to the image quality:  It is very nice, and the images taken with the flash are also very sharp.  I took a picture of my keyboard in the dark with slight incandescent light in the background and one would have thought that the shot was taken in pure daylight.  Also, for my, and most other people's uses, 1600x1200 should be more than enough.<br />What really sold me on this camera was the interface.  I went to the local Best Buy and played with it for a while and I love the interface!  Easy to use, effective, and quick access to important controls.<br />I highly recommend this camera.","Not disappointed by this camera at all.  I was talked into buying it, as I normally run away from Sony products, especially those using Memory Stick.<br />It takes great pictures and connects nicely to my laptop computer.<br />Sure, the 13-hour charge is a drag, but part of that is due to the 1750 mah capacity of the batteries.  That's a powerful battery for NIMH AA-size.  I've had the camera 2 weeks, shooting all over the place, and am still on the first charge of the battery, filling up my 64 Mb card twice.<br />Maybe the next version will have a built in MP3 player to take advantage of the new 512 Mb memory sticks that will soon be out???","I sympathize with the W2K buyer, since I had similar meltdown with an HP printer & XP. But no problems with XP and this little baby. No software to install. Just plug in USB, XP installs, you re-boot, and just as others say, your camera is a disk drive. Don't buy a PCMCIA adapter! Having used CF etc, I beg to differ with the motorcyle guy--memory stick is better (as most Sony storage devices are). Works as expected. Very light. Fast (no optical zoom to wait for--or bump into). Wish it had ISO800 equivalent and 1 cm thinner, but it fits in my pocket. Also, will not turn on accidentally as my Canon S10 did. And it does not have a proprietary battery that sells for US$100 like my Canon has. The NiMH's seem to go a lot farther, too. If you want a camera you will actually take along, this should be high on your list.","I have read all the previous reviews everywhere about this cameras and decided to get this babe. I am very happy with the price and the extra free 128 MB memory stick offer that I got.<br /><br />The only bad thing, which nobody mentioned previously, is the charging time. Sony includes a charger but not a fast charger. It means the NiMH batteries will take approximately 13 hours to charge! Interestingly, you can get chargers from Kodak and Olympus that charge four NiMH batteries in 4 hours.<br /><br />In the user manual, Camera Starter Kit Model # ACC-CSNQ has been suggested which has a Super Quick Charger that charge the batteries faster, but it has not mentioned how much faster. Sony web site has no information about charging time of that Super Quick Charger unit either. So, if anyone knows the charging time of ACC-CSNQ Charger please write a review for others because it may be the second purchased after Sony P31. :)<br /><br />Anyway, everything about this camera is fine except the batteries charging time which if you do normal shooting it won't be a problem for you because you may need to charge batteries rarely (once a week or in two weeks). However, if you take more than 150 photos non-stop every 3 hours, you probably need to get a faster charger just in case. I suggest Kodak K2000, Olympus B-50SU, Lenmar Pro711, Lenmar Pro744 or Millenium CH4 Chargers which I have not used any of them but there are many kind people who wrote some reviews on them.<br /><br />Thanks to all people who write reviews, God Bless You All ;)","Awesome pics for the price.  Fits in my jacket pocket while on the motorcycle.  The only thing I really hate is it uses Memory Stick, but that's Mr Sony's way of sticking us for more money.<br />The best feature, it uses regular AA batteries (use NIMH however)!!!  No more propriatary batteries that you can't get a refill for at Disneyland or somewhere like that.","After shopping around a bit, I decided on the DSC-P31 and am very happy with my decision.  It's easy to use, but at the same time includes some advanced features.  The picture quality is impressive and the built in viewing features are a piece of cake. Downloading to the computer is also very easy.  Once the driver is installed, all you have to do is plug in the included USB cable and the camera becomes an external drive.  All you have to do is copy and paste the jpg files onto your hard drive and delete them from the camera to start fresh.  There is no optical zoom, but if you're mostly used to using point and click cameras, you won't miss it.","I got this camera as a gift and have never been big into photography before, but this made it easy.  To clear up the fights about the computer cable; the camera comes with a USB cable to get your pictures on the computer, but it does not come with a AC adapter to plug the camera into the wall.  You must run the camera on the batteries because of this.","I just recently bought this camera and let me tell you it is worth every penny.  The quality of pictures I took with this camera is national geographic quality.  I definatly recommend getting a 32mb card though.  Downloading is fast and easy, the computer recognized the camera and downloading was a breeze from there.  Believe me when i say this, THis camera is fantastic and takes unbeliveable pictures from beautiful sunsets to close ups on mushrooms, the pics are clear and in brilliant color. FOr the price this camera is a steal...","Overall this is an excellent camera. It is small, and lightweight, but very well built and feels sturdy to the touch.<br />The camera features 1600x800 resolution (2 mega pixel)and a digital zoom. Surprisingly the pictures taken with the digital zoom turn out acceptable. They are not nearly as nice as if there was an optical zoom, but for images that don't require a lot of detail they are ok.  Even so, if you plan on using the zoom feature a lot you'd be better off buying a camera with optical zoom instead of only digital zoom.<br />The camera comes with an 8mb card, enough to hold about 20 pictures. It also comes with 2 rechargeable AA batteries and a charger. Finally, contrary to the other review I read it does come with a USB cable for connection to your computer.<br />The camera has a lot of nice features including the ability to record motion mpeg's. Unfortunately it does not include a microphone so you can't record sound with your \"movies\".<br />The only thing that I do not like about this camera is the flash. The camera has red eye reduction, but the way it is implement is annoying. The camera flashes several times before taking the photo, almost like strobe. The effect is very disconcerting for people and all too often the photo that is taken is of people grimacing because of the multiple flashes. Even with red eye turned off the flash fires twice, again causing people to blink when the picture is actually taken.<br />But other than the flash I've been very happy with the camera and happily recommend it to others.","Excellent camera for the price.  The only thing it could really use is optical zoom, but I wouldn't expect that for this price.  Everything works great on it, and it will hold 393 640x480 pictures with a 64 meg memory stick.  I'm not quite sure what one other reviewer was refering to when he said that it did not come with a cord to put your pictures onto the computer.  It comes with a USB to FireWire cord...  works great, no real need for a docking station.","I bought the SONY DSC-P31 on the recommendation of a friend.  I knew nothing about digital cameras  before starting to look, and the SONY DSC-P31 turned out to be perfect.  The instruction manual and software are easy to understand, even for a novice. The camera is lightweight,2 megapixels and has  an 8 MB Memory Stick.The 2  AA rechargeable batteries and rechargeable unit are included. What it does not contain is a power cord for putting the pictures into the computer and I purchased a card reader and am very happy with it.  The quality of the pictures is very good and quite sharp---even the autofocus feature is good with 2 choices for setting point of focus.  There is absolutely nothing I dislike about this camera, and I couldn't have made a better choice."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P51","amazon_reviews":["This is a great little camera!

Although the CD that comes with the camera will not load into newer operating systems (I have Windows Vista), I am still able to remove the memory card from the camera and plug it into the media port on my computer and download everything just as well. It's a great item, with reliable Sony quality, and all the features you could ask for in a lightweight point and shoot camera.","I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA AT BEST BUY IN BROOKLYN NY. I NEVER HAD ONE SINGLE PROBLEM WITH IT YET. I DO NOT KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE COMPLANING ABOUT A BLACK SCREEN? I NEVER SEEN OR HEARD ABOUT IT TILL I READ THE REVIEWS. I HAVE HAD THIS CAMERA SINCE DECEMBER OF 2002. GREAT PICS. YOU SEE RESULTS WITHIN SECONDS ON THE LCD SCREEN. I HAVE UPLOADED SO MAY PICS. FOR WEDDINGS, PARTIES, CONFIRMATIONS, ETC....ONE REVIEW SAID, HE DID NOT WANT TO BUY SONY PRODUCTS ANYMORE? I HAVE MOST EVERY ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT FROM BOOMBOXES TO A 32 INCH STEREO TV. I WOULD NOT THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING A SONY PRODUCT. I AM ALSO THINKING ABOUT BUYING A NEWER VERSION OF A SONY CYBERSHOT, MAYBE A SMALLER VERSION. THANK YOU. I HOPE THIS HELPS","Same thing that happened to these other reveiewers...  the infamous black screen...  I've had it for about 2 years now, and randomly now and then, i'll take a picture and get a black screen for no reason...  i've never dropped it, and treated it with a lot of care...  it took great pictures, but i'm scared to see how much SONY is going to charge to fix it...  is it even worth it, is the question?  and yes it is a shame that sony wouldn't recall these and fix them for free...","I don't understand why there's some people complaining about the quality of this camera.... This is a 2MP camera!! People cannot expect the picture quality of a 3, 4 or 5MP camera.  I have been using this camera for 3 years already and it's working just fine... The only problem that I had with it, was that the flash stop working one day, and when I called Sony they help me over the phone, and the camera was fixed in the spot... And the Customer Service at Sony was great too....<br /><br />It's pretty easy to use, even for people that have never used a digital camera before.<br /><br />I read that somebody said that he's not gonna buy Sony anymore, well too bad for him.... I love Sony so much that I have almost everything Sony, and the best part is that I can put my camera memory stick in the Sony TV and in my Sony laptop and I can view the pictures, without using any cables.... That is just amazing!!!<br /><br />If you want to have a camera for everyday pictures and for printing small pictures this is your camera.  I have even printed 8 x 10 pictures and they look pretty good.<br /><br />The only reason that I'm giving a 3 stars it's just because I prefer a camera with more mega pixels.... But, if we're talking about 2mp cameras: this is a 5 Stars!!!!","I've been very pleased with this camera for two years. I don't take a lot of pictures, but it's simple and easy to use, and suits my needs.<br /><br />It just recently started with the blacked out lcd, so I went to the reviews to see if this was a problem. Lo and Behold, it was and there was the solution. I admit whacking a camera does'nt say much for Sony, but it shows how shopping on Amazon pays off.<br /><br />Since I don't have an extended warrenty, I'll just hit it till it dies.","First off, I'd like to say that I've had this little camera for three years now. I'm now doing the research to buy a new one with higher MP, but this one is still going strong.<br /><br />If you're the type of person who just wants a point-and-shoot digital camera, this one will be pretty good for you. It only has 2 megapixels, but the extra features are pretty handy. You have Black & White mode, Sepia mode, Negative mode, and Solarize mode. It takes little mpeg movies (without sound) and you CAN zoom in and out while recording video- I've heard of cameras where you can't do that. It takes pretty good pictures with good battery life (I love the fact that it came with rechargeable batteries AND you can use AA's) and I've loved using this camera.<br /><br />Now onto the cons. If you use AA batteries, it will eat them up. Your best bet is to use the rechargeables. If you use the digital zoom, the pictures become more blurred, but that happens on all digicams. It takes a while to start-up, but the thing that bugged me most was the time it took to turn the flash on. If you're low on battery life and you press the flash button, prepare to wait a little while. It also takes a while to take a picture if you use the flash as well. The flash function on this camera is poor.<br /><br />I didn't have any problems with this until the past few months, but what did I expect? It's lasted three years already! I began to experience the \"black screen\" problem and just recently, it began flickering as well. But what do I do when that happens? I take out the batteries and put them back in again, but if that doesn't work, I just drop it on a (carpeted) floor and voila! The impact seems to make it work again.<br /><br />Again, you get what you pay for, plus a little more. If you're going to buy a digital camera and have the money to burn, I would suggest investing in a newer model. But if not, you have yourself a fine little camera right here.","I got this camera a little less than two years ago, and generally, it's served me pretty well.  However, about a year ago, I too began experiencing the seemingly notorious \"black screen\" problem.  When it first happened, I was completely confused as to why it was going on--I certainly hadn't been careless with this camera, hadn't dropped it or anything.  In a panic (like a lot of other reviewers here, I'm finding), I gave the camera a couple of taps.  Lo & behold, the LCD screen came back on...but you know, it's never been the same since.  The black screen thing still happens all the time.  The picture quality has gotten grainier, it seems, and the camera's never been quite as able to focus like it used to.  I've been disappointed with the picture quality since that time.<br /><br />So...while the camera was still working properly, I felt that it was working well.  However, judging by all the reviews here, there are some glitches in the camera's design that probably make it obsolete compared to some of the newer models available now.  It does make me a bit hesitant to buy another Sony camera, although I do find their cameras to be some of the more user-friendly models on the market at this time.","I bought this camera a year and a half ago. All was fine. I was delighted with the results. Then the lcd started to flicker and now it has gone white. So thats my camera out of action. I see alot of other people having the same problems. I'd ike to recommend this camera but what lies down the road....<br /><br />I'm so fed up...","i had this camera for about 15 months...and everything worked great...pictures came out sharp and vivid<br /><br />then the black screen LCD issue came about...and it looks like i'm not the only one...and i thought this camera was doomed until i realized a simple solution.<br /><br />i was extremely panicked the day this problem arose...since i was taking pictures at an important event...so in my panic i gave the camera a hit with my hand...and by some miracle the LCD came back on and i was taking pictures again!<br /><br />so as another reviewer has said...hitting the camera WILL and CAN fix the problem...so you do not have to ship into to Sony.  BUT here is exactly what i did in hitting the camera: hold the camera in front of you with your right hand with the LCD facing you...then with your left hand free, take your left open palm and slam it against the left side of the camera...repeat as neccessary until the screen comes back on (you must be very FIRM when you hit it...but pain is not necessary)<br /><br />so a couple days went by and everytime i turned on the camera the screen would start black...and then when i firmly hit it...the screen came back on...but then a week later i turned it on the screen came on with the camera and i haven't had a problem since!!!<br /><br />i would give this camera 5 stars without problems...and i would have given it like 2 stars if this problem persisted...but since i was able to fix it and i am happily snapping pictures with no problems...i can give it 4.","What I like about this camera the most is the fact that you can hook it right up to your TV and review the pictures that you just took for all to enjoy.","Overall pleased with the simplicity and versatility of this camera.  Photo quality is very good at this price level.  However, I would rate the reliabilty of this camera very low.  My camera was handled with kid gloves, but the camera lens failed to open automatically when in camera or mpeg mode, only after a few months usage.  Error message appeared on screen directing me to \"turn the camera off and back on again\".  This advice did not work, even after trying a soft reload. Apparantly the microprocessors in this camera are of very poor reliability, ...  Sony should repair this malfanction free of charge, especially for those that registered their product.","I got this camera for my birthday in December..It was the first digital camera I had ever had...I've never had any problems with it so far and it's the simplest camera ever! Jusy always have spare batteries with you when your using it for a long time...Overall this camera is amazing!","Very  good execellent  camera<br />This  is  my first camera and  i was  amazed  by the  quality  of  pics  , I think now  i am  a  professional photographer with this. At  the price it is offered it is  best deal.<br />I  like  the  feature only  problem is  battery  but  then  i  have  spare  battery  but execellent  camera","The Sony DSC-P51 is the best value for your dollar.  These are NOT refurbs.  Excellent digital camera for general work.  Batteries will last through 100+ pictures at standard mode.  Great clarity and super ease of operation.  Researched most other options available and settled on the Sony for reliability and price/value cost.","I was always sceptical about the quality of digital photography as I work with large format film-cameras. But I needed to capture some images from old newspapers from our library archives and it was cumbersome using the standard camera equipment - until a friend loaned me this camera. Since then, I haven't used my other cameras! It was just point, shoot, download to the computer, crop and print! What used to take me days, is now done in minutes. I can get fairly close with the optical zoom, the resolution is sharp, and the image-capture is often more that I really need.","This camera is excellent.  I got it in January of 2003 and haven't stopped using it yet.  It works great both outdoors and indoors, and it's loaded with special options.  One of the best features on the camera is the high powered flash.  It takes the best low-light pictures I've ever seen.  I use the cybershot nickel AA batteries in my camera and took 70 flash pictures without needing to change the batteries!  This is the perfect camera for anyone who is a casual photographer like myself.<br />Pros:<br />Easy to Use<br />Battery Life!!!<br />Plenty of Options<br />Excellent Quality Low-Light Pictures<br />Easy Camera -> Computer Interface<br />Cons:<br />The \"ok\" button can be tricky to push at times.<br />(really nit-picking but I had to find something wrong.)","I'm new to this digital camera world and this was my first camera. The DSC-p51 delivers a good image with its 2.0megapixels. The digital zoom is very good. First, I thought that using the digital zoom would make the picture look not so good, but I must say that I was incorrect. The image quality is good, at least for an amateur like me.","I bought this particular Camera for my marketing job and was meant to be a company camera where i could expense it. Three weeks later my daughther was born and i took the camera to the delivery room and took some pictures,...i tell you this camera is worth the money.<br />I don't work for the company that made me buy the camera and they asked for it but i decided not to expense it and so i kept it.<br />Great Features on the camera, the flash is great and the view finder is great too.<br />Takes excellent 4 x 6 pictures and the quality is just superb.<br />Great setup features, upgrade your memory stick if you take lots of pictures, recommend 64 MB thats what i use.<br />I'd recommend it any time any day.<br />U know what my Inlaws bought the same one too after seeing it.<br />Great for e-mailing pictures too, with the USB connectivity.<br />Only thing no sound on the mpeg format of pictures you gotta get the MAVICA for that feature.<br />Thanks and ENJOY","It does what I want it to do which is take good digital pixs. The price is right and it's easy to use.","Awesome camera, easy to use, but with a lot of options. I suggest getting a bigger memeory card (64 or 180), and the accesory kit, it has a charger thats a lot quicker than the one you get with the camera, two batteries, and a handy carrying case for the camera.","This camera is the best in its class. Sony includes many features that set it apart from other brands, including easy to use menus, power saving feature, and size. The battery life is excellent; I was able to take just under 200 pictures on one charge. Normal batties can be used, but won't last longer than 15 or 20 minutes. At highest quality, you can get 30 pictures on the supplied 16MB memory stick. Pictures come out very well, although a macro setting would be nice to have. Multi burst and video are also handy features to have. Overall, this camera is a very good value for the money. You can get by with the included accessories, but other camera accessories can be expensive.<br />Pros:<br />* Comes with battery<br />* Comes with charger<br />* Comes with 16 MB memory stick<br />* Menus are simple and easy to use<br />* Includes USB cable<br />* Effects and camera settings (shutter time, white balance, etc) should satisfy the average person<br />Cons:<br />* Batteries must be charged to retrieve data from camera with USB cable<br />* 13 hour charge time with included battery charger<br />* NiMH batterys, while cheaper than LiIon batteries, have memory effect (They're only $...though and are supposed to last at least a year under normal conditions)<br />Note: Don't leave the the batteries in below freezing temperatures, as it will shorten the battery life.","There are too many digital cameras available today. Overall this is an excellent machine. I does have a lot of options for operation so you should get familiar with the manual to understand and being able to use its capabilities (nevertheless you can always select \"auto\" for most options). Optics are very good, I use to have a Sony Mavica and I bought this Sony cybershot a few months ago and I must say I am quite happy with it.","I've owned 35mm SLR and point-and-shoot cameras for almost 30 years and have to say I'm very pleased with this camera. The high points:<br />-- 30 flash pictures so far and no red eye<br />-- Size. The DSC-P51 slips easily into a jacket pocket but feels substantial in your hand.<br />-- Image quality. I've used online photo services to have my images printed professionally with excellent results for 4\"x6\" prints. The pictures are acceptably sharp and the color is very good.<br />-- Flexibility. I can easily set-up the camera so my wife and son (who don't like messing with the control menus) can simply grab it, turn it on, and shoot. On the other hand, I appreciate the simplicity of the controls and the range of available features (including the ability to raise or lower the intensity of the flash)<br />-- LCD viewfinder. Clear and sharp--even outdoors.<br />-- Extras. A charger, 2 rechargeable AA batteries, a carrying strap, a 16 mb memory stick (enough to get you started) and a USB cable come with the camera.<br />Things I'm less crazy about:<br />-- Lag time. Call me old-fashioned, but when I click the shutter button I want the camera to take a picture immediately. Like most digital cameras, this one has to think it over for a second or so before it actually takes a picture--an eternity if you're shooting candids. While this is annoying and it's easy to blame the camera, the fact is that only 1 in 4 of the candid shots that most people (including me)take on film cameras pan out anyway. In practice I find that I can still get good shots if I just stick with the shot and don't freak out when the camera goes through its gyrations. If I don't get a good shot, I delete it and snap another.<br />-- Recharging the supplied AA rechargeables. How does 13 hours sound?<br />-- Using regular alkaline batteries. While having the ability to use off-the-shelf alkaline batteries sounds great and can work in a pinch, I've found that the camera draws a lot of juice quickly--especially when taking flash photos. Sometimes this can cause the camera to shut down after I take a shot--a problem I've never had with the supplied rechargeables.<br />Re. accessories, consider buying a Lexar memory stick reader. I have Windows XP on my PC and no additional software was required to use it. Also consider a 128mb memory stick and the optional Sony accessories kit (with fast charger, 2 extra batteries, and case).","This camera is truly amazing!  I'd been using it for weeks, taking hundreds of amazing quality images before I even knew it had so many advanced features.  That's one of the things that makes this camera so great...  It's so easy to use out of the box.  The advanced features never get in your way like they do with other cameras.  When you want them, however, they are really very cool.<br />My favorite feature I've found so far is the low-light outdoor portrait.  My friends and I took a trip to DC a couple years ago, and took some pictures in front of different attractions at twighlight with a film-based camera. When we got them developed, all you could see was us... there wasn't enough light for the camera to caputre the background.  With the Sony, however, that's a thing of the past!  Simply put the camera on a solid object or tripod, and turn on low-light portrait mode (very easy to do).  The flash on the camera goes off twice really fast,and then continues capturing in low light mode.  What it  does is uses the first flash to find what is close enough to get with the flash, the second flash captures that image, and then the lens stays open for up to two seconds longer capturing the low light background!  The pictures taken in this mode at twighlight look amazing!  Everything is nice and sharp... beautiful.<br />Another great feature is the ability to use the camera's zoom controls to zoom in on pictures you've already taken when viewing them on the LCD.  Reviewing your pictures is great, but it's hard to tell if someone has their eyes closed in a shot, etc. when you're viewing on a 2\" screen.  Well, with this camera, you can zoom right into their face to see.  Very useful!<br />This doesn't even begin to describe what this camera can do...  excellent quality, perfect color - truly the best digital camera I've ever owned.","I recently bought a complete computer system, and also a digital camera to try it out.  I had heard that digital cameras are so versatile and easy to use...no more fumbling with film at crucial moments.  The main feature that attracted me to this particular camera was the fact that you can record a 5 min video (without sound of course) on here.  The video will be able to be displayed at about 3/4 the size of the computer screen when you play it back.  You can change that feature to be about 50 something minutes at a pretty small size on playback.  I was thrilled with this prospect as I would be able to record my best friend walking down the aisle at her wedding...priceless.  So far I have found this camera VERY easy to use and the features are great.  You can opt for black and white prints, sepia, or even reverse black and white (which is basically like a negative).  The pictures are incredibly crisp when you view them on you computer and when you print them.  You can also choose to turn off the LCD screen on the camera to save A LOT of battery life and just use the view finder.  Overall, this is a WONDERFUL compact, versatile camera for anyone looking to get into the digital age.","In short, if you are looking for a well made, reliable digital camera that does not cost too much for the basic needs you are looking for in a camera, this is a great camera to look into getting.  Like most people, I didn't need the [amount] mega model camera because my needs are very basic.  I wanted something that i could take basic pictures, and that had the basic digital camera advantages like being able to view pictures after they are taken and delete any that are just wasted space.  Sony has a great system and if you happen to have a sony desktop, this camera is even more for you due to the added ease of transfering pictures. This camera covers all the basics everyone wants from a digital camera and also has some advanced features.  The quality is good and the product is well made.  Sony is a name people have learned to trust and the DSC-P51 is no exception.","I Just got this camera as I'm now stepping into the digital world. I did some research and this camera has some of the best features you can get for under $300. The 2.0 MP is nice even though I never need that high a resolution. The 2x optical, 3x digital is what seperates this camera from p31 but the extra 50 bucks is worth the extra zoom. Very easy navigational menu.Very compact camera. The only 2 things I wish the camera had are:<br />1) capable of recording mpeg audio and 2) bigger LCD screen.<br />To get these features you would need to spend another $150 for the Mavica and I can't afford it.<br />W/ the 16 mb memory stick, i can take 200 pictures before i go to my computer. Also, SOny is having a deal where you get $20 off sonystyle.com if you purchase this camera so i got another 16 mb stick for $5 in case i need a backup.<br />Overall, Great deal. If you can afford it, get a Mavica cd or floppy camera but if you don't need the extra features i mentioned, this camera is for you.","I bout this camera about 6 months ago and I am very please with it.  It takes amazing pictures even if it is only a 2 mega pixel camera.  The interface is easy to learn and understand as apposed some of the other cameras that I tried out before buying the DSC-P51.  The screen is nice is large enough to allow for easy viewing of the pictures you have just taken.  Also what I found nice was that the cam came with rechargeable batteries, so you can take all the pictures you want without having to buy new batteries.  Overall a great camera, I would highly recommend it.","Very easy to use, takes great pictures and has a nice quality feel.I found battery life to be very good,I have heard of other cameras only capable of 20-30 shots before batteries were gone.I just used this camera on vacation ,took 50+ shots in 1 day {I was using a 128mb memerory stick,highly recommend} and the batteries never got below the 50 % range.I would also recommend the acc. kit for this camera , you get a very nice case and 2 extra batteries and a charger that charges in 2 hours instead of 14 hours.Over all, very impressed with this camera.You can't go wrong with this quality Sony product.","I just recieved my P51 and I have to say it's an absolute stunner! It looks better than almost any digital cam out there, and the picture quality is breathtaking, as are the host of options...Don't get less than a 64MB memory stick though... 2 megapixels are more than enough for viewing on your computer screen and printing on full a4 sheets","I am sure this is a great camera, but why waste all this money on the extra pixels?  I do not have this awesome Sony camera, but i am recommending another SONY DSC camera.  The SONY DSC-P20 is a 1.3 Mesgapixel camera that takes great pictures for someone new to digital Cameras.  I got mine expecting less than normal film camera clarity, but got at least, if not more than film quality.  All you need is the camera, a good Lexmark inkjet, and some Photo quality Paper for photo quality prints!  Since i got the Camera, i have always looked to SONY for my digital stuff.  I am sure this is a great camera, but why waste all this money on the extra pixels?  If you just want normal picture quality, look lower in the 1.3-1.5 megapixel range.  My SONY camera is actually my 5th digital camera, because all the others werent up to my high quality standards.","This camera is my second digital camera the first one was a web camera wich took horrable pictures compared to my new camera.  This is a very nice camera it takes clear and crisp pictures and is well worth the money.  I especially like the multi burst feature.  I like everything about it.  It also looks really cool.  It was a little hard to work everything at first but the manual explained everything very well.  The menus were easy to work.  The editing software was very easy to use and looked even better.  If you are looking for a great camera at an even better price this is right for you.","i had this camera for a while now so far it was very good and lots of features, ill some things about this camera:<br />Good things:<br />- 2x, 6x zoom<br />- Good HAD<br />- Real 2 megapixel<br />- comes wit a changer<br />- ISO 100,200,400<br />Bad things:<br />- some times the colour is a little paile<br />- 3meter flash power outdoors in doors is very good but a<br />  little weak at dark but if u use ISO 400 it'll be fine<br />- NO TIFF (UNCOMPRESSTION)<br />- NO GIF (COMPRESSION)<br />_________________________________________________________________<br />the worst thing is that it doent have GIF or TIFF format for better picture to print but it will do fine wit jpg<br />but overall the best camera out of the 6digicams i had and i give this 5/5","To begin, I'd just like to say that I am very happy with this camera.  It's suits my needs as a beginning photographer very well -but it is by no means a 'pro-consumer camera.'  I believe that the camera is solidly constructed (even though it is a plastic body).  It feels very sturdy and well constructed.  An aluminum body like the P9 would obviously be more appealing, but I can't expect much more than high-grade plastic from a sub-300 dollar camera.<br />I'd rate the feature set of the camera as its weakest attribute -keep in mind that i rated the features as 'good.'  This is clearly a point and shoot camera with enough options to produce excellent pictures in nearly every situation.  Keep in mind, to attain excellent pictures in difficult lighting conditions, you must learn the menus and how the features like Twilight mode.  The only features I would like to see on this camera is the ability to manually adjust the aperture and shutter speed.  I think the camera does an excellent job of automatically choosing, but the option of manually choosing would be nice.  Also, the 2x optical zoom is a little paltry... 3x optical zoom would be nice.  I guess I'd have to spend an extra $100 dollars for the P71 to get those features and 3Mp resolution.  Oh, and the lack of sound while recoding videos is a little annoying, but I think that shooting videos with digital camera's is rather gimmicky and useless.  This feature, or lack there of, means little to me.<br />I felt the image quality was very good...excellent for 4x6 pictures and perhaps slightly larger, but you can always have a higher resolution:) I really am very please with the picture quality and I'm rather amazed at the clarity for such a low budget camera.<br />The menus are very intuitive and I have only glowing praise for the user interface of the camera.  I felt all of the menus were well designed.  Please take the time to learn the menus...it might really help your picture quality.  Overall, an excellent user interface.<br />Lastly, I felt without a doubt, that this camera was an excellent value.  It comes with everything you need to get started.  You can fit 30 pictures at the highest resolution (standard compression) on the bundled 16MB memory stick.  This may seem a little small, but it's equivalent to one roll of film (and of course reusable).  Also, I've seen prices for 128MB memory sticks for around $60-$70 so the prices are very comparable to SmartMedia and other types of camera memory.  I'm very please with the included recharable batteries and charger.  Sure it takes 13hrs to charge the batteries, but I still think it's an excellent value for the money.  There are no additional costs with this camera -unless you want a faster charger or more memory.  Oh, and the batteries last an exceptionally long time.  Mine haven't even come close to running out yet, so I don't know quantitatively how long they last, but I already pleased with the battery life.<br />Overall, this a good buy for consumers looking for a point-and-shoot camera for 4x6 prints (and occasionally larger).  I think this also good for someone just beginning to learn photography because it does offer some primitive manual adjusts, like adjustment of the film speed, and of course all the benefits of digital photography.  Namely, instant feed-back of pictures and no film development costs.<br />I'm pleased with this camera....a good buy.","To begin, I'd just like to say that I am very happy with this camera.

Namely, instant feed-back of pictures and no film development costs.<br />I'm pleased with this camera....a good buy.","This was my second digital camera I've ever used.  My first was a Samsung SDC-80, which was a bit of a disspointment, yet there were still some good uses for if used correctly.  Almost the same applies to the DSC-P51 in my opinion. The first 10 shots I took appeared fuzzy, mainly because I couldn't feel the \"half-clicks\" as there are in most other Point-and-Shoot cameras. Later, I found out where the \"half-click\" point was, and from then on, I got amazingly good focus.<br />The twilight mode is ok. It requires a second or two's worth of time to acquire and capture the images though, so you better have a tripod or really steady hands if you don't want blurry pictures.  The camera seems excessively sensitive to light sources than most other cameras I've used, and the entire picture will go dark if there's any \"sunny spot\" or other bright spots on the picture.  In general, if done right, you get perfect pictures.  If there's a slight error, you might end up with a dark or blurry picture.<br />The worst thing about the camera is the JPEG compression.  Of course I don't expect it to save in TIFF or uncompressed mode (1600x1200x24bit = 5.49MB/shot) on ... Memory Sticks, but none of the pictures look \"picture perfect\" at 100% view due to the artifacts from JPEG compression.  Hence why I have to either resize my pictures to 1024x768 or crop to 1500x1200 and reduce to 1280x1024 for my 17\" monitor.  A pain that I will always have to put up with, but ok for those who just want to print on photo media.<br />All that aside, this is a really good 2MP camera for the price it goes for. It's loaded with features that I haven't even gotten around to using yet, and with 3 hours of battery time, I'm loving it.  I'd recommend the camera to anyone who is a veteran of digital photography and know how digital cameras work.  Even if you're not, it's an ok camera to start out with, but don't expect to get good pictures first try - takes a lot of practice.  But after you get the hang of it, the camera is definitely worth the money.","i haven't had the camara too long, but so far i really like it.  the only complaint i have at this point is that if you don't hold extremely still when taking a picture, especially if you are using the zoom at all, they picture will be fuzzy.","This digital camera for the price is one of the better digital cameras on the market. The clarity is remarkable, and the user friendly usb port downloading is great! I have only bought sony since I have heard of bad reports from other brands, I was sold from the first images that I viewed.","First of all - the information that...is showing is incorrect. I have my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P51 sitting in front of me - it DOES have a 2x optical zoom as well as a 6x digital zoom.<br />We bought this camera mostly to take pictures of our kids to e-mail to family overseas. Something it does very well. The pictures look great - the features the camera offers are even better!<br />The features - (as listed on the box)<br />2.0 mega pixels<br />6x digital zoom<br />2x optical zoom<br />mpeg movies (without sound)<br />multi burst<br />Also in the box are the following -<br />battery charger<br />size AA nickel metal hydride rechargable batteries<br />video cable (to connect and view on TV)<br />memory stick (16mb)<br />USB cable<br />CD-Rom<br />Overall this is a great camera - at a good price. I would recommend going to a store to look over your options though!"]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P71","amazon_reviews":["Love it","Older camera, but simple and easy to use for a fumble fingered person like me.  Great value and prompt service.  Just be aware it uses an older Sony memory stick, larger than a memory card.  We ordered separately and it works great!","This camera model is approximately 10 years old but works  beautifully. Be aware, however, that the Memory sticks are difficult to find any other place than at an online dealer.  It is well worth the bother to me.","I have had this camera for about 2 years. It's been great all the way. But recently one of my friends dropped it. The lens is having a hard time retracting back into the camera, and the LCD screen only works sometimes. It does power on and off though. I was wondering if anyone had experience in this field and could tell me if it was simply broken for good or if it could be repaired some way. If you could email me at lafever5@hotmail.com or post a review I would appreciate it.","Sony has just about infiltrated every electronic marketplace possible and the digital camera sector is no exception. When I was researching to buy a camera, it came down to the Canon A40 vs. the Sony DSC P71. I went with the Sony because it was smaller and I didn't want to carry around the larger Canon. I wonder now if I made a mistake as Canon cameras are constantly being raved about.<br />The P71 being my first digital camera it would be unfair to say I was disappointed. It has a decent zoom 3x Optical and 2x digital. The form factor of the camera is a huge plus. It's very small and light and easy to carry in a jacket pocket. The LCD is 1.5\" more than large enough to see images clearly. The 3.2 megapixels has allowed me to develop beautiful, clear 5 x 7 photos. Even the 8 x 10 pictures come out very well.<br />The strength of Sony digital cameras lies in taking outdoor pictures. The colors in natural sunlight are vibrant and clear. The pictures taken outdoors always come out beautiful - especially in areas where flowers, trees, and grass are present.<br />I have seen very few digital cameras that take nicer outdoor pictures than the Sony P71.<br />The navigation is very intuitive even if the buttons are a little small. Sometimes I find it hard to find the center \"ok\" button - I often accidentally slip my finger to the right or left. When going through pictures taken already, the preview images render very quickly on the LCD. The camera offer a plethora of options for shutter speed, contrasting, picture quality and resolution, as well as view.<br />Battery life is good. I can go through a 64 MB memory stick at high resolution on one set of batteries (and flash). Sony also provides a free set(2) of rechargeable batteries and a charger with this camera. This is a very very nice addition and accessory for this price. I bought an extra set of rechargeable batteries to keep as a spare (one set always charges while the other set is being used).<br />Also provided is a USB cable to hook up to your computer to download images. This is an extremely easy set up with Windows XP - just plug the USB cable into your computer and camera and XP automatically recognizes your new hardware. You don't need to install the provided software if your computer already has a default picuture viewer.<br />Now the reasons this camera received just 3 stars:<br />1) Remember how I mentioned that this camera takes great outdoor pictures? Well as great as the outdoor pictures are, the indoor pictures are as equally horrible. I don't know if it's the flash or Sony's interpretation of artificial light, but every single indoor picture is dark with an orange tint. They are clear, but the coloring is always off. It's like I'm looking at pictures through sunglasses.<br />2) I wish Sony would have configured this camera to leave the flash on when I turn it on. The default setting for the flash is always \"off\" so when you turn the flash on and the camera is idle for a minute, it turns itself off and sets the flash to the off position. This wouldn't be annoying if it didn't take the camera so long to re-initiate the flash. It takes a good 5-7 seconds to re-initiate. Furthermore, what would make most sense would be if the camera just sensed when the flash was needed and turned it on itself. That's what most cameras do.<br />So there you have it - a layman's review of the Sony P71. I'm not a hobbyist or a professional photographer, I just use the camera for fun to basically record memories. The Sony P71 is an decent camera. If you take a lot of indoor pictures, stay away from it, otherwise, it will serve its purpose.","This is my first digital camera & I have been using it for over one year.  I use it for both my business & vacations.  It is very easy to use (especially for beginers).  It is also great because there is never any film to develop (for those of us who forget to drop it off or pick it up).  It has some wonderful features like color or black & white, the buttons are easy to use & the instructions are great.  The viewfinder on the back is very clear & choice of image size is great.<br />In addition to the camera I would purchase a tripod and an additional memory stick (128MB is a great price at amazon.com).  If it is still available the starter pack with case, battery charger, etc... is also a good choice.","This is my latest camera and I'm using it for web purposes.  The picture quality is great and the zoom is also very useful.  What I love about this camera?  Fast when taking a new picture, great flash option.

I love the camera itself because it is easy to use, i did not even looked in the manual for instructions.  It takes brilliant pictures and the battery life is quite sufficient.  I would recommend buying a spare set of batteries though!  This item would be a perfect camera if it had more memory bundled.  You'd definitely need a bigger memory stick if you are planning to buy this camera.  However, after all pros and cons, I would say that this camera has a high benefit/cost ratio!","I'm convinced that SONY does indeed make the best electronic stuff available in the market today.I may be a bit biased because everything in my day-to-day life involves a SONY..may it be a note-book/PDA or even while working out in the gym.But..what can I say..they are simply the best !! So when it came to buying a digital camera I didn't think twice and went straight for the DSC-P71.Me thinks..3.2 MP is good enough for anyone who ain't a professional.Compare the ever-lasting battery life and crisp image quality with any of the other brands(notably CANON, OLYMPUS..)and you'll be amazed by the way it beats it's competition...hands down. 5 stars all the way *****","Pros: Image quality, build quality, battery life, superb LCD<br />Cons: Noticable level of noise, color cast in some instances<br />I've owned this camera for over a year and I still love it. The build quality is superb. The battery & memory stick covers are spring loaded and snap into place snugly. I know alot more digicams are made of chic stainless steel now, but the silver plastic this camera is made of still feels sturdy IMO. The tripod mount is thankfully made of metal. The camera is well balanced and is comfortable to use. It's easy to grip & hold and 1 handed shooting is no sweat. The LCD is the sharpest and brightest I've seen(I've used an Canon A20 & Fujifil 2650 - no comparison). The menu's are easy to navigate, and almost all options are less than 2 menus deep. The thumbpad on the back of the camera is used to navigate menus in menu mode. When in shooting mode it provides a VERY handy \"view last picture\", flash on/off/auto, self-timer, & macro mode. All controls are easily accesible and seem very intuitive to me. The 3x zoom is very responsive & precise. No lens cover is needed because lens protectors automatically close.<br />Image quality is excellent. When viewed on your monitor, the details & sharpness is extraordinary. I took a gag shot of a friends open mouth full of brocolli she was chewing and when I viewed the shot later, I could see incredible detail in the brocolli, down to each stalk. Color is very accurate in most situations. Outdoor shooting produced superb images. Shooting at night maybe produce images with slightly noticable noise sometimes. Shooting in cold weather & when the camera is first turned on may eliminate most of the noise. Incandescent light can cast a yellow tint and fluorescent lighting can cast a green tint on images, as with most digicam.<br />The auto settings is accurate 99% of the time in my experience. The camera offers some manual controls(ISO, exposure comp, white balance), but it lacks an adjustable shutter speed. The night scene option will keep the shutter open for up to 2 seconds. To take pictures in brighter conditions with longer shutter times(to induce blurring or whatnot), I use the night option and lock the auto focus on a dark area by pressing the button halfway down. I then aim at my original shot and press it the rest of the way.<br />Overall I'd say this camera is almost unrivaled in it's price range. The Canon Powershot A20 & Fujifilm Finepix 2650, althought $...-$... cheaper, comes nowhere close to the build & image quality. I have yet to use the Fujifilm Finepix 3800 which is in the same price range as the P-71, but I've heard that that camera is an excellent buy. Too bad it wasn't available when I purchased my P-71 or I might be writing about a Fuji :).","like anything, its got its drawbacks.<br />this is my first digital camera and i just LOVE it.  the picture quality is great!  what attracted me to the this particular model were the following:  the sony brand/reputation, the design (it's small, compact, and lightweight), the 3.2 MP, and the rechargeable batteries.  the batteries were definitely a priority for me.  also, i wasn't looking for a high-end model, just a digital camera for my own personal use.  i've read that this model is great for 4X6 and 5X7 pictures--  anything larger than that size and you'll see a deterioration in picture quality.  i researched and shopped around for about a month and a half before making this purchase... and i really think that this digital camera gives me everything that i want at a decent price.<br />now for the cons:  i was a little disappointed that the included battery charger took THIRTEEN hours to charge 2 batteries!  that's wayyy too long for anyone's liking.  also, the included memory stick is kind of flimsy.  right away, i knew that i would need to purchase another memory stick with a higher capacity as well as a case (i mean, you just spent a few hundred dollars, so you'll need to protect/preserve your investment).  i decided to buy the accessory kit acc-csnq (which comes with a case, two extra batteries, and a \"super quick charger\" which would take one hour to charge as opposed to the ridiculous 13 hours).  again, i was disappointed that the kit cost [so much], but i felt that i couldn't do much since that price didn't drop despite waiting another month before making this purchase.  seriously, this \"kit\" is just another way for sony to make more money.<br />overall, a GREAT digital camera, but with the much needed accessories, expect to slap on .. additional [money] to the bottom line price.  enjoy! :)","I bought this camera about 2 weeks ago and I love it! It has a great interface, is pretty quick, and excellent quality. It connected to my computer and TV with no problems. The LCD is very clear and easy to see. The flash is great and I recommend turning it on whenever you're indoors.<br />However...two things that bother me about it are that: 1. The LCD screen doesn't have a cover over it, so finger marks and stains show up very easily 2. The Navigation button is a bit annoying cause the \"Accept\"/\"Enter\" key is a part of it and not seperated. But I think both of my complaints aren't that serious when you look at the camera overall.<br />... Hope this helps.","After extensive research I finally found the camera I wanted, a Canon Powershot S30- wouldn't you know it, Amazon was sold out. So I setteled on this Sony instead. Overall a nice, easy to use camera. My only gripe is the software included. It is lame. Many other cameras come with some kind of editing software or a lite version of Photoshop. This software seems to be only worthwhile for creating photo albums.","I really did not want to spend this much, but this camera is worth every penny. The controls are easy to learn and use. The photos are great, and the zoom is very good. My only gripe is that it does not come with an AC cord, but it comes with rechargable batteries (that actually work!), so I won't gripe much.","This camera is very easy to use.  The AutoFocus and illumination work very well, and the image quality is excellent.  Transferring pictures to my computer was also very easy.  I used the included USB cable to connect to my PC, and copied the pictures over just like I was copying any other file on my PC.  I would recommend getting a larger memory stick than the one included (128 MB sticks are available) so that you can store more pictures at a time, and I would also buy an extra set of rechargeable batteries.","One of the criteria I used in selecting this camera, was that it use AA batteries. Well it does, but only Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries!<br />It says it CANNOT use \"Managanese batteries, lithium batteries, nicad batteries, alkaline batteries*.\"<br />It does say \"Alkaline batteries can be used with the DSC-P31.\"<br />Other than that, it is a great camera. It comes with 2 \"AA\" nickel-metal hydride batteries, but be prepared to buy a spare pair.","This is a v.good Camera , It is my first Digital.It is very easy to use , In the beg. i thought it would be complicated , but with the manual you can easly do anything with this Sony.<br />Get 128 MB memory Card , and you no longer need your laptop with you to transfer images to empty the memory card.<br />Shooting movies is fun though missing SOUND.<br />Battery lasts until you charge them back.","I love to share great moments with friends and this camera makes it easy.<br />The baterry charger is great and the battery also last long enought to take several pictures with the flash included.","I purchased the starter kit along with the camera and a 128mb memory stick. The kit came with an extra set of bateries, a perfect fitting case, and a quick charger.  2 Sets of batteries is all you'll need - keep the extra set in the case.<br />Picture/Color quality is exceptional in my opinion. I print amazing pictures with the Epson 785 model. Both support Epsons \"print image matching\" which saves the image specific info with the picture and pipes it to the printer for crisp and clear prints.<br />Focus works well.  Static Focus can be set for a specified distance, or auto focus for either the center of your subject, or use multi points of focus.  In darker settings (and closer range) you can use the built in illuminator to help the camera find your focal point(s). Also, download of picutres is quick through USB.<br />The only drawback I have experienced is the delay between pressing the button and the camera taking the photo. This may be caused by a setting that I have not set properly and/or it may be common among digital camera's (expecially using auto focus). I have learned to anticipate picture perfect moments but still would prefer that the image is captured the second I click the shutter, not a half or one second later.<br />In all, Great Camera for the price.","I've had my Sony P71 for about 2 weeks now, and couldn't be happier. I really struggled between getting the Sony and the Canon S200, but went with Sony because for only  more than the Canon I got 3.2 megapixels and the 3.0 zoom I was looking for. Plus, this camera uses batteries that aren't made by Sony, so I can save money. So far the picture quality is excellent - the colors are very sharp, the pictures are in focus, and my friends and family have been seriously impressed by the quality. I've been using the LCD screen and the viewfinder (the LCD screen is much more accurate), and my batteries don't drain fast; the battery life has amazed me, especially based on what I read about digital cameras and batteries. The computer/USB hookup was easy on my Windows 98 system. I haven't used the movie mode yet, but am really looking forward to movies that can be 30 minutes long with a larger memory stick. This is my first digi cam and I am definitely impressed and looking forward to taking my Sony on holiday very soon!","As mentioned above, I love this camara. I don't know anything about the technical aspects of digital camaras, but a friend of mine who does said he was suprised to see how much the camara has for the low price.  The pictures are incredible, I've had it for a month now and haven't noticed a single problem with any of the pics. Sometimes when using the scene mode, the photos come out a little fuzzy. The manual says it's because the exposure is longer and you should use a tripod. It'll be fine if you just find a stable surface to put it on. This camara also rules because it so sturdy. I dropped it onto a marble floor from about five feet. Just snapped the lens barrel back into place and it worked perfectly. If you don't have a USB port on your computer like me (I have a really old computer), you can by the Sony floppy disc adapter, insert the memory stick, and use it just like a regular floppy disk. I previously owned a HP 215 digital camara and this is in no comparison a much better camara.","This is my first digital camera. I bought this to 'test the waters', before plunging into Nikon D/Canon EOS D series. Sony DSC P71 is a fabulous camera when it comes to color accuracy, clarity of pictures,ease of use, and good features at this price level. It comes with an international charger and NiMH batteries. Noise at ISO 400 is noticable, yet the indoor night time pics are very warm..<br />Now over to the undesirables..!<br />1. The digital zoom is practically useless. Picture looses clarity. I have disabled this feature. 3x Optical zoom is great.<br />2. 16mb is a joke - suggest you purchase a 64/128 mb.<br />3. The most frustrating thing about this camera is the shutter delay. i.e the time it takes the camera to record the scene after you click. That one+ second seems like an eternity. If you have a two year old, forget taking a good picture in one shot. I usually end up taking up 10 pics to get a couple right. The other 'delay' is between pictures. I am not sure if this problem is isolated to Sony or all digital cameras in general. Just this annoyance has convinced me to put off buying a more expensive digital camera for a while. I switch back to my SLR when this 'delay' gets to me!<br />If delay would not bother you, go for it! It is one impeccable camera.","I've had my Sony DSC-P71 for a month and a half, and I think it's a wonderful piece of equipment.  I have alot of experience with 35mm film cameras, but this is my first digital.  As such, I found it a little complicated at first, but the instruction book is very easy to read and helps greatly when you need to find out about a specific feature or function.  And the Memory Stick storage media is excellent -- small and relatively inexpensive, you can store loads of medium size high-res images on a 64MB stick.  Uploading images to my desktop PC was a bit of a challenge the first time, but onve I got that figured out, the USB hookup makes it fast and relatively painless. I look forward to shooting lots of great pictures with this nice little camera!","This camera is the most amazing camera I've touched!  Crystal clear pictures!  This camera lets you film too. It comes w/ a 16mb memory stick but I've upgraded to a 64mb so I can take a ton of pictures or capture a lot of film! There are many many features that are easy to use.  The other day I showed pictures that I just took on my camera to my brother on my parents big screen television w/ the video out cord that comes w/ the camera.  You won't be dissapointed!","First, I would recommend using the side-by-side review feature at dpreview.com/reviews/sidebyside.asp. A friend sent me that link, and it was invaluable in trying to compare multiple models, once I had decided on a Sony. It's especially helpful when deciding on whether to opt for features like \"movies\", optical zoom settings, and so forth.<br />I do *not* regret buying a Sony camera, since it is wonderful to pop out the Memory Stick, pop it into my Vaio laptop and have immediate access to the pictures - so much easier than the typical connect-the-camera and transfer-the-pictures routine.<br />Since getting this camera, I find it's much harder to navigate menus than the previous digital camera I had (Kodak DC4800). The compact size, long battery life, and Memory Stick feature make this model well worth it!<br />Also, you should absolutely plan on at least a 64MB Memory Stick if you are having your shots developed by Ofoto or similar, since you'll want the high/fine resolution for prints. The 16MB Memory Stick that is included with the unit is not nearly large enough, holding only about 9 high-res pictures.<br />This model, if you get it at around ($$$), is the perfect combination of features, size (it's small and easy to carry), and price. Highly recommended, you just have to study the manual to figure out the menus.","I have had the P71 for a month now, and while I like it, I don't love it. It appears pretty well made, though the power switch is often hard to activate and as a result, I've missed some quick shots I could have taken with my Olympus 2100 or my Canon S110. In addition, I find the control labels and the viewfinder text to be smaller than any other camera I've had, making it a challenge to pick the right setting at times. Picture quality has been good, both in daylight and with the flash, and the subject illuminator works quite well at anything less than 6 feet (making the flash unnecessary). The 3 megapixel resolution is excellent for enlargements up to and including 11\" x 14\", though I rarely shoot over 1 megapixel (more than enough for email, website posting and 4\" x 6\" printing). The 3X true optical zoom works well, as does the quick-time movie feature (though the latter lacks sound, something you might expect at this price). My major complaint has been battery use; 2 AA alkalines will last less than 40 photos, and a set of 1600 milliamp rechargeables about twice that. All in all, I will probably continue using my Olympus and will make a Christmas gift of the Sony.","We went from our old, bulky, slow digital camera to this camera and couldn't be happier.<br />We used it today for pictures while we were hiking. Some pics under redwoods were a bit dark, but a little adjusting in Photoshop worked wonders. Almost all of the pics are perfect the way they are.<br />The controls are easy to use. The batteries seem to last quite a while. We haven't run out of battery power yet, so I don't know how long they will last. I took about a hundred pics while testing it over several hours, the battery display was still at a half. The included charger is slow, so we're going to get the starter kit. ASIN: B000066HU8 The tripod mount is metal, our old camera had a plastic one...which got stripped easily. The eyepiece helps save battery power , and also helps with taking pics in poor lighting conditions when we can't see the screen too well. The time it takes the camera to be ready after turning it on is only about the same as most point and shoot cameras. It is very quick between pics also.","I am a first time digital camera user. When I finally made my choice, I narrowed it down to the Sony DSC-P51 and 71 and also the Fuji Finepix models. The DSC-P71 is a truly incredible and great camera! I love the zoom capability of the P71. The manual is easy to read, the instructions easy to follow and the camera itself is easy to use, whether you are a pro digicam user or a novice like myself. I never had so much fun taking pictures with this camera! I had no problems downloading the drivers and the camera has functioned properly. I went to many electronics stores looking for the Sony DSC-P51 or 71 and I was lucky enough to snag a P71. These cameras are hard to get! The picture quality is truly astounding and Sony's imagestation.com has easy to download instructions on how to view and print your pictures. The only negative is the included battery charger. It takes 13 hours to charge 2 batteries! Go with the STAMINA Starter Kit instead. Also, it is recommended that you upgrade the Memory Stick to at least 64 megs. Other than that, you won't be disappointed with this camera. I for one was amazed at how great simple-looking pictures turned out. And the design of the P71 is pretty cool-looking too! Sony does it again!","After much extensive research, I finally narrowed it down to 2 potential cameras. The P71 from Sony and the Kodak DX4900. Both selling for the same price, so it was a matter of which was the better camera/deal. The Kodak had slightly better resolution and 1 more Megapixel than the Sony, but here's why I chose the Sony:<br />Batteries: The Sony comes with rechargeable batteries and a charger. Kodak comes with alkalines (no charger)<br />The Feel: The Kodak felt cheap. The body is cheap plastic and the buttons and compartments seem easily breakable and far from durable while the Sony had a nice sleek look and a professional quality feel to it.<br />The Features: The Sony comes with a mpeg movie mode (no sound) where the Kodak doesn't have a movie mode at all.<br />So, how do I feel about my choice? Pretty Damn Good.<br />The Sony P71 is a quality camera. There is no question. The design is very similar to the other models from Sony but a little bit slimmer and lighter. The LCD on the back is bright and vivid and the colors look crisp and nice. The pictures I took came out very good. I took the camera into the woods and took some wilderness shots in the middle of the day and the pics came out beautifully. The trees and water, everything looked great. The movie mode is also a very cool feature. While it would have been much better with audio, it is still a very cool feature and can be used for various different things. Also, the movie size is only limited to the size of your memory. (Get a 128mb card!!! I did and it is so worth it)<br />The camera is very easy to use. I didn't even have to read the manual. After monkeying around with the features for about 30-45 minutes, I learned pretty much everything. It has a nice, simple interface. Kudos to Sony for that. There are various different picture effects you can use, such as black and white, Sepia etc. and you, of course, have the option of choosing your prefered resolution.<br />The camera also comes with red-eye reduction and a special feature found only on Sony Cameras, called the AF Illuminator. This feature is very cool because it helps you take pictures in the dark a lot better.<br />Overall, this is a wonderful camera that is easy to use, durable, nice looking and takes quality pictures at high resolution and megapixels with the option of several effects and features. The only reasons I gave this camera 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought the pictures I took in very low light could have been a little brighter, no audio with the movie mode and I've only had the camera for a week, so I don't know about the test of time. But I am very pleased so far.<br />If you're like me, and want a dig cam to have some fun with and take some great pics, but don't want to get a second mortgage on your house to buy it...then look no further than the Sony P71. A quality camera at a quality price.","I Got a Sony P20 but i gona change to a P71, any way, i'm writing to show my experience abought bateries life time in Cyber-Shot cameras:<br />Normal Batteries: +- 7min<br />Alkaline Bateries: +- 16min<br />Rechargeables Bateries 750mhA: +- 35min<br />Rechargeables Bateries 1800mhA: +- 2h (yes... it's true)<br />I buy 4 1800mhA bateries and it's more than suficient.<br />Hope I help some of you.<br />Sorry abought my writing... :)<br />David Ligeiro","Best thing I liked, it has both NTSC/PAL video out and I can connect with any TV and view Pictures as I go..<br />Great piece and highly recommended!!","When I went out to buy a digital camera, I figured that a traditional camera brand, like Canon, Nikon or Olympus would make the most sufficient digital cameras. I was intending to purchace the Nikon Coolpix 3.21MP digital camera for [$$$], when I noticed that there was another camera with the same features and the same optical zoom as the Nikon, except it was only [$$$]. It was the Sony DSC-P71 Cyber-Shot 3.2MP with 3x Optical/ 2x Digital Zoom. I decided to take a gamble and I purchaced the Sony over the Nikon. When I took this baby home, I was very very pleased with the performance of this camera! The pictures I took, both indoor and outdoor photos were of a lot more quality than I once expected! I have owned the camera for only 10 days, and I already took over 700 pictures, and filmed over 30 short MPEG movies! The 21\"X16\" photos I took with my camera, both indoors and outdoors look completely realistic! Not to mention, there is myriads of options and ways to enhance your photos! You need a camera with many options and settings to make tasteful and unique photos. Picture taking becomes jejune if all the photos you snap are standard color photos. I'm a junior photographer at 14 years old, and for you other young photographers looking for a HI-RES. camera for a great price, I strongly suggest the Sony DSC-P71.","The Sony cyber-shot P71 is an exelent camera. It is extremly easy to use, and yet the things it does is endles. The camera comes with rechargable batteries and charger, an 18 mb card, a wrist strap, and software. There is one thing else that you need. A bigger memory card. There is no backing down from it. I got a 64 mb card, and it is great. I can do movies for about 30 minutes! Although it is not a camcorder, it is so much fun to make movies.I was worried about the picture quality. It turned out that I worried for nothing. 3.2 megapixels is great.All of the controls are in the right place. The zoom is better then I thaught. Since the picture quality goes down when you use digital zoom. the camera tells you when you zoom in over optical zoom, and are now using digital zoom as well. Putting pictures on your computer is easy. I have windows XP home edition, and I find that XP makes it even eaiser to se your pictures. A lot of cameras also need an expensive USB driver for the computer to read yor memory card. But the USB driver is built right into the camera, so you can just hook up tour camera to the computer. Overall, this camera is a great camera, with great pictures as well as many cool features. Its great!","I have used several digital cameras in the past couple years...  The DSC-P71 is not the most expensive, but is by far the best I have used yet.  This is my second Sony digital camera, and Sony has always impressed me with their digital imaging.  The lighting and color interpretation and contrast really make the pictures spring to life!  Often the pictures look far better than reality.  Pictures on overcast days actually look like it's sunny out.  In the same price range is the Canon S330.  It is a great camera as well, and VERY small and easy to use.  A real nifty package!  But it only has 2.0MP resolution, whereas the Sony as 3.2MP.  The optical zoom is the same, both have rechargeable batteries, and both come with 16MB memory cards.  Sony is at least as good a brand in my mind as Canon, especially for electronic products.  Hands down, my vote goes to the Sony.","I have had my DSC-P71 for about a month now and couldn't be happier. After upgrading the memory stick to 128 MB and buying a couple of sets of batteries I was ready to go.<br />I have been taking hundreds of photos of my new baby as well as outdoor photos. Close, indoor, outdoor, etc. most have turned out great. The only issue I have had is with the flash... sometimes \"firing\" when it shouldn't.<br />After installing the drivers, I simply use Windows Explorer to \"cut\" the photos from my cameras memory stick and \"paste\" them to my hard drive... no need to mess with the \"packaged\" software, etc. to move the photos.<br />Battery life has been suprizingly good. I thought that I would need to charge the batteries more often, but I don't need to.<br />I have had past experience with the Canon S series at work, but find this camera much easier to use and takes better pictures. The mpg video only capture feature is also a nice perk.<br />Overall, it's compact, easy-to-use and takes great photos.","The first problem I noticed after buying the camera, was its hunger for battery power; I used up my batteries in less than 10 minutes (LCD screen turned on). Later on I realized that the reason for this, was the quality of the batteries I used (cheap ones). Finally, I charged up the included Ni-MH AA batteries, and was able to shoot pictures for much longer, even with the LCD screen.<br />As for the resolution, it is very satisfactory for a camera of that price, with that many functions. In fact, I dont even use the maximum size too often, the smaller sizes of the pics are enough for a good quality shot.<br />A good thing about this camera, is that you can use it as both a manual-settings, and an \"idiot-machine\". It has good auto-focus, even in dark areas (with the AF-Illuminator turned on). If you're using autofocus, all you need to do is press the shooting button half way, and in about 2 seconds, the lens will adjust itself, to form clear, sharp pictures. If you want to play around with the settings, you can define the distance between the camera and the object you're photographing.<br />The camera also offers ISO, EV, WHITE BALANCE, FLASH LEVEL, and SHARPNESS settings. So as you can see, you can get many different results with all these settings available.<br />Transfering the pictures to the computer is rather easy. I have WinXP pro, so as soon as I plugged in the included USB cable, the computer recognized it, and automatically installed it. I didn't even have to use the included Driver CD. I also tested it using Win98SE, works good as well, but you will need to use the drivers on the CD. In WinXP, you will be able to use a special wizard which will automatically rename the pictures for you, and put them in a certain folder. In Win98, the camera will appear as a removable-drive (it will also appear in XP) and you will have to copy the pictures manually.<br />One of the reasons I bought this camera, is its size. Sure there are other cameras even smaller, but this one offers great picture quality, and many manual settings (even effects like B&W, Solarize, Sepia, Invert). I often carry it in my pocket, but you might want to get the carrying case, especially if you want to avoid scratches.<br />A great option available in this camera, is the ability to shoot movies. It offers three resolutions: 160x112, 320x240, and 320(HQX). I dont know what HQX stands for, but it sure improves the quality of the movie. The one thing that really bothers me, is the lack of sound recording while shooting a movie. It's a big minus, but the main reason I bought it was shooting PICTURES, not MOVIES, so I won't complain much.<br />Sony didn't include an AC cable, but instead you will get a battery charger (the batteries they included are rechargeable, so you'll save lots of money). You will also get a cable that will let you view the pictures on a regular TV.<br />Another big minus, is the use of MemoryStick. The reason? It's less popular than other cards, and it's more expensive. Sony includes a 16mb card, just as most other companies. With the lowest picture quality, you will be able to get 240 pictures on this card. Using the highest quality, you will get about 15 shots.<br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera, and I recommend it to anyone else interested in more advanced photography.","First, the rechargable batteries last Much longer than P-50.<br />There is significant lightess (in weight) of camera apparently from using more plastic(hopefully sturdy).<br /><br />Results are fantastic, easy to use yet loaded enough for serious amateur.<br /><br />Just the right price for 3mp quality camera with 3x optical zoom.","Simply put, this camera is simple! Sure it has some cons, like the movie mode not featuring audio. Or the fact that it doesn't come with an AC power cord. But for a digital camera, it gives you a no bull layout. An easy to use menu and not too many bells and whistels. It really isn't much more complex than your nice medium sized film camera. i highly recomend for pictures NOT requiring PERFECT quality. that doesnt mean it won't blow you away with good pictures. great for the standard photographer. a nice camera to use a a substitute to a nice film camera. take this one into consideration!","I get great pix.  Check the settings if you aren't getting good quality. If the image looks bad on your screen, it's probably because of the way it's being compressed by the image viewer to fit on the screen.","Summary - the most camera I could find for [the price] in a small hanld held size. Lots of useful features. I am very satisfied with it as an artist tool. For landscapes less lens would be too far away, for blow up pics, less mega-pixels would be to grainy.<br />The Good.<br />Unlike film cameras, this camera produces all hues of the color wheel correctly. It also records a larger range of darks and lights. As an artist I have paid for professional studio shots of my watercolor paintings that are not as good as this camera. These qualities are mostly a function of digital vs. film camera. All camera films have color bias and less value range than what a painting can have. However, even among digital cameras there can be some color bias, this one has perfect balance. Also it can see into shadow areas revealing details better than most film cameras. With 3 meg Pixels it produces 4x6 inch pictures at 340 pdi on a printer, very sharp.  Posters and magazine are printed at 150 dpi for this camera that would be about a 8x10 print, they still look better.<br />It has an amazing macro lens with a tulip icon. I took very close and very sharp pictures of tulips with it. Other subjests may work well, I don't know yet.  It is packed with lots options like White Balance for cloudy days, very helpfull in Seatle.  Other good features are manual focus, noise reduction, and  in low contrst situations  when the autofocus feature is confused it sends out a a flash to see the subject and get a fix, all cameras should have this feature.<br />The not so good.<br />Some low contrast areas have speckles in them at about the grainness level of ISO 400 film.  This is very slight and most people will not notice.  It also may be a factor of the \"PaintShop Pro\" software translation to the HP 1220 printer, because this graininess does not show up on the monitor.<br />Even with 3x optical zoom distant objects like Mt. Rainier show up at about 90 percent of their actual size, though this is  pretty good at this price.  Note 3x optical zoom cameras are not all alike.  I depends on 3 times what size you start with.  A Kodak 3x camera gives a much shaller or distant picture.<br />It comes with out a camera case and a slow battery charger, 13 hrs. But Sony gives you a $20 coupon towards buying a kit with a case, batteries and a fast charger 2hrs. for $40.  You really want to have spare battieries and a charger that recharge them as fast as you can use them up.","I have owned this camera for about a month now and it has been well worth the [money] price tag! I love the movie mode! Sending short movie clips to family and friends around the world has been great. The con would be that it does not have a sound mode, but for the price we can't have it all! It sure beats carrying the camcorder around! My biggest reason for upgrading from my Kodak DC3200 was because I needed a camera that would take a picture of a moving target! My 3 year old! I have been MOST impressed with its picture quality and have used postcard services like [URL} to send them instantly. I have to tell you this is ONE neat camera and really EASY to use !!!","This is my first digital camera and so far I love it. I think it's very easy to use compare with other camera in this range. The price is consider reasonable for Sony brand also. What I love the most about this camera is the Nimh rechargeable batteries. They're very affordable and you can find them every where. ...","I've received my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P71 today.  This is my second Sony camera.  My first one is a Sony Marvica CCD1000 (I was and still am satisfied with this baby).  I cannot resist comparing the two cameras.  DSC-P71 is a much more lightweight and compact camera.  It has 3.2 MP photo quality.  A good number.  What's impressive is that it uses 2 AA Nickel-Metal baterries - small rechargeable batteries can last roughly an hour in full function.  It comes with a battery charger too!<br />What is disappointing about this camera is that the photo files are so compressed (186kb with Fine quality) that they don't look good on my computer screen, nor do they look impressive on prints.  For Pete's sake, this is a 3.2 Mega Pixel camera, why wouldn't Sony let it produce uncompressed photos files?  Another disappointment: the camera does not come with an AC-adopter.  You will have to buy it separately. ... Another big Q for Sony, why wouldn't you include the AC-adopter?  I have one more disappointment: the lighting of this camera is poorer than my initial expectation.  I only tested indoor photos, but they (not including close-up photos) look a bit dull although supported with good lighting and with the camera set to the highest exposure.  I am not a professional, but I think this camera is better suited for bright outdoor photo taking.  I also tried the Macro, well, you cannot position your camera too close to the subject or else it will just become blurry.<br />Well, it seems I have more cons than pros for this camera.  My take on it is, I will keep it.  Like I said, it's small, much smaller than my bulky Marvica CCD1000.  It's the size and batteries that matter.  For some reason, I am a Sony fan.  Hopefully, they will come out with a compact and  kick [butt] camera!"]},{"name":"Sigma SD9","amazon_reviews":["The Sigma SD9 has been around for 12 years (introduced in 2002) and this model is now available used at very affordable prices. This camera is capable of stunningly good photography, but......only if you have patience and you are willing to work within its limitations.  The primary limitation is the ISO range, 100, 200, and 400.  Of these three, the only practical setting is 100, the other two are simply too noisy.  This camera shoots RAW format images only and Sigma's Photo Pro software leaves a lot to be desired, so use Adobe Photoshop if possible to convert the raw images. The absolute longest shutter opening is 15 seconds, but only with ISO 100, shutter is limited to 1 second at the two higher ISO settings.  This camera functions well when the lighting conditions are good, but poorly with marginal light.  In particular, the autofocus needs good light and subject contrast to perform well.  The camera is heavy, around two pounds with a small lens and more with Sigma's heavier advanced lenses.  Overall, if you are willing to work with the camera's limitations, you will achieve excellent results.  Not for casual 'point and shoot' photographers!","I'm a bit late in writing this review since I've had my SD9 for one year.<br /><br />The image quality of photos using the SD9 can be quite stunning.  The level of sharpness achieved by the Foveon sensor is amazing - it can resolve detail that Bayer sensor cameras (all other digital cameras fall into this group) simply cannot.  Couple this camera with one of Sigma's \"EX\" lenses, particularly the super-sharp 50mm EX macro lens, and you'll love the results.  I enjoy macro photography and this camera is excellent at macro photography.<br /><br />I'm certainly not in the league of a real photographer as I'm just a casual type who enjoys taking pictures.  As they say, the proof is in the picture and I've seen the proof!  Forget about the megapixel rating and the fact that the Sigma is \"only\" 3.4 MP.  The Foveon sensor has 3.4 million photosensors for each primary color - that's 10.2 total MP - while a 6 MP Bayer sensor has 6 MP for all three primary colors.<br /><br />Why a four star rating rather than five?  This camera is not without it's issues, like all cameras.  The SD9 is not a very good low-light performer.  If you need ISO speeds faster than 100 then the SD9 may not be for you.  High ISO shots are noisy although you can get very usable high ISO photos if the conditions are ideal.  The SD10 addressed this issue.  The SD9 does not have a built-in flash but those units are not suitable for serious flash work anyway.  This camera can only use Sigma SA mount lense so the choice in lenses is not as wide as for a Canon, Nikon, or Minolta user but Sigma makes some very, very good lenses and they certainly offer more choices than I can avail myself of.  If you want in-camera jpg files, look elsehwere.  The SD9 shoots only in RAW format and you have to process the photos.  This is actually the best way to shoot, there is so much that can be done with a RAW file that one cannot do with a TIFF or jpg.  The Sigma Photo Pro software is a gem of an application that is extremely powerful and easy to use.<br /><br />Again, look at the results and you'll see that this camera is an extremely capable performer.","i have had this camera for almost 2 years now and am still in love with it.  i use the EX series 15-30mm lens and there isn't a situation i have found where this camera doesn't kick the [...] of any other digital camera (except for maybe the new SD10).  i have a friend with a Canon that cost a ridiculous $9,000 and her pictures look like junk in comparison.  i recently took a photo i took with my SD9 at a canyon in new mexico and had it blown up to over 3 feet wide.  of course, the file size is absolutely huge, but the print out is stunning.  you cannot even see the pixels.<br />i love this camera.  it is amazingy easy to use and the pictures come out wonderfully.","Well, this camera is something special and I have been  compelled write this review because of couple of reasons. For the first, here the reasons. I read many bad , negative reviews of this camera and in the same time all those people who actually used it told how much they have being amazed by the picture quality it produces. So I've decided to try. The camera's images are not amazed they are stunned. The image quality is so high that it left me speechless for the first.<br />I'm just wandering about those who left negative reviews about it? The CNET review, that named it \"mediocre SLR camera\" is just a plain lie. In my opinion they giving point for those who gives more money, it's it. Another interesting \"review\", I read from Ken Rockwell (really gifted photo artist!, no questions!), who reviewed this camera without even try it!<br />So let start. First of all, it is NOT 3.5M camera. It is AT LEAST 10M camera, but megapixels in the traditional meaning just are not applicable here. This camera produces NEGATIVES. This negative is result of 10M photo elements. In the same time any of 6M cameras has HALF OF THEM GREEN and ONLY 25% red and another 25% blue. If we speak about \"image quality\" using this kind of \"resolution\" , this camera produces 14M images. In the same time the \"real\" resolution of those \"6M\" cameras stand about 1.5M, the everything else is a pure deceiving interpolation. I see that Cannon and NIkon, aren't  happy to see this Sigma on the market, since it MUCH SUPERIOR to any camera they make they started to discredit it.<br />I do not say it is an ideal, but it close. Much closer than everything else that feels like SLR.<br />This Sigma produces PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES. I mean it. There's full range of amazing continuos beautiful halftones as you can see on the best reversible films. The pictures are spectacular.<br />Since it is real photographic tool, you come back to the true that photography and it is about light. Your raw pictures will normally produce 3000 by 4500 huge images that is not interpolating, they just \"enlargements\" from digital negative. It reviles as many details that ANY other camera can't produce. There are 14M cameras on the market, but they DO NOT MUCH this SIgma in the meaning of photography. I can blow my raw image 4 times more and it still looking better than those from 14M Canon. By the way, those image from Cannon show horrible color reproduction, especially in the red. For example two closely colored redish colors coming out the same!<br />This Sigma saves colors! It saves the real colors, not the estimations, not the interpolations but the real thing. Camera has just the everything that it has to have, including the high speed synchronization up to 1/6000 !!!<br />The lens from Sigma just as good(or better) as any other lenses from Nikon , Cannon or Minolta. Even cheap $100 tag slow glass is of very good optical quality. Yes/ for $100 you're getting slow lenses, but it almost distortion free and high contrast! But fro $300 you can get perfectly fast, noticeably bright zoom that at least as good as any lens from \"leading companies\".<br />Camera is very well constructed, it handles as it should be, the focusing system is fast, the screen is bright and clear, all controls location are very clever and logical. I like this camera and you're going to like it too. No boundaries anymore. You can print image as large as you need, no questions. In two, three years Foveon will overcome. I","Given reasonable light, this DSLR bests all others in overall image quality with its 10.2M sensors and astounding sharpness. The best digital portrait camera in existence.<br />Don't be fooled by the camera's 3.5MP rating--that is non-interpolated--all other digital camera manufactures, including all DSLRs, list only interpolated resolutions as their MP rating. This inflates other cameras' MP rating by a factor of 3 times relative to the SD-9, since they count each Red, Green, and Blue sensor as a sigle \"pixel.\" The SD-9 counts a full set of three sensors, one Red, one Green, and one Blue, as a single \"pixel.\"  Foveon.com claims the SD-9's image quality bests film for any given capture area, and approaches medium format film quality for enlargements up to 40 inches. Some report that sharp enlargements up to 8 feet on the long side are possible from the SD-9's interpolated 14MP output files. The camera's software is the best available.  The SD-9 always works losslessly, so be sure to compare only RAW mode specs when comparing to other DSLR's operating speed and convenience of workflow.<br />Price is amazingly low for a DSLR with so many sensors, now below [$$$]...Hopefully Amazon.com will match them soon.<br />Not the best DSLR for low light--low light noise is a  weakness. Still, can produce very fine low light/night pics with experience.","I'm basically a point and shoot kinda guy. Before this I owned a run of the mill Olympus D-490.<br />Wow, what a difference. I've been snapping away for over 2 weeks with this little gem and am shocked at the picture quality. It's amazing what a little jump in technology can do. This X3 chip produces great color, fantastic detail and it's easy enough to have running in minutes, providing you have all the batteries, and it takes alot.<br />The downsides are that it's heavy, like a couple of pounds w/ the lens and flash (sold separately). It's expensive, try shelling out 1.5k USD and telling your wife it's for a camera. Ouch.<br />It requires Sigma software - I think if your going to charge an arm and a leg for a camera, it should take images in a standardized format. I appreciate the fact that the images in \"sigma\" format are infinitely manipulatable, but geesh. At least give us a choice if we want all that control in every shot.<br />The pics cant be blown up very much. Now as an aside, I'm no master with the software yet, but on Hi quality with autofocus on the darn thing makes great pics, but viewing at anything over 2:1 magnification in Paint Shop produces pixelated images. It's a quirk, but it matters to me.<br />Other than that, like I said, images are great. It's fun to run because it's so much like a pro-shot camera, but still easy enough for the average PHD to run it. (PHD= Push Here Dummy ;)<br />...","I got mine last week, and it's image quality is the best of any digital camera.<br />My only complaint is that for the price they skimped on the little things... Specifically one of the battery doors is poorly made (I broke it after inserting the batteries :-( )<br />But after shooting pictures almost continuously over the holidays, I have to say that the Sony 717 doesn't compare.<br />Lance","unlike some reviewers, i have actually seen and held this camera.  while i only took 3 pictures, simply loading them and having a look is shocking.  this camera and the underlying X3 chip blow away everything in digital photography today.  getting all three colors (rather than one like all other digital cameras) in each pixel gives you images you can easily enlarge without loss and artifacts.  this camera easily blows away cameras costing many times more.<br />this isn't a true 3 MP camera.  it is more like a 9 MP.  but better.... there is no longer a reason to not go digital.<br />getting 3 colors per pixel means no interpolation.  that in turn means sharper, truer color, photos without artifacts.  in short, digital photos without the digital look.  some of the photos taken with this camera are as good as medium format film images.<br />digital is not as good as film, it is now better.","My star rating doesn't count because I have not tried the product.<br />Seattle customer, is it correct to infer that your opinion is not based on actually trying the camera? As I understand it, the Foveon image sensor in the SD9 is different from the sensors in the 6 megapixel cameras you refer to in that each pixel in the SD9 is capable of sensing either red, blue, or green light, whereas in the conventional sensors any given pixel can only sense one color. That means it takes three pixels in a conventional sensor to provide the true color data provided by one pixel in the Foveon sensor. There may be more pixels in an image from a 6 mp sensor, but many of those pixels are artificially created by computer interpolation rather than being based on direct sensing of incoming light. Also this means the conventional camera must take more time to process the image in camera.","The Sigma uses a new kind of light collecting chip which senses R,B,G colours at each of the 3.4 million pixels on its chip. The more common chip used by all other cameras senses only one colour at each pixel. So the Sigma should win hands down! Not necessarily. 3.4Mp isn't many pixels. Sony, Nikon et al. have 6Mp cameras using the standard type sensor. At the end of the day, more pixels give better resolution. So a 6Mp sensor does as well as the Sigma 3Mp sensor for colour and resolution.<br />Fuji has tweaked the standard sensor format to use hexagonal pixels and get better resolution out of their 6Mp sensor chip. In August 2002 the Fuji S2 pro is due out, and its 6Mp chip will produce 12Mp photos. That's 12 million pixels of info to make a photo. They do this by analysing the data from the 6Mp and modifying it to \"fill in\" extra detail and colour. The result to Joe bloggs on the street will be photos pretty close to ordinary 35mm quality.<br />If Sigma produce a camera using their new technology chip but with 6Mp, then it will be a force to reckon with.<br />Slight problems with Sigma are you have to use their lenses. The Fuji is made to use Nikon lenses. Canon and Nikon have their own equivalents to the Fuji.<br />Personally I'm waiting for the Fuji S2 Pro as I already have a Nikor AF auto-focus lens which I'm not ready to pass up. The Fuji is going to cost less than its Canon/Nikon counterparts...","The Sigma SD9 has been around for 12 years (introduced in 2002) and this model is now available used at very affordable prices. This camera is capable of stunningly good photography, but......only if you have patience and you are willing to work within its limitations.  The primary limitation is the ISO range, 100, 200, and 400.  Of these three, the only practical setting is 100, the other two are simply too noisy.  This camera shoots RAW format images only and Sigma's Photo Pro software leaves a lot to be desired, so use Adobe Photoshop if possible to convert the raw images. The absolute longest shutter opening is 15 seconds, but only with ISO 100, shutter is limited to 1 second at the two higher ISO settings.  This camera functions well when the lighting conditions are good, but poorly with marginal light.  In particular, the autofocus needs good light and subject contrast to perform well.  The camera is heavy, around two pounds with a small lens and more with Sigma's heavier advanced lenses.  Overall, if you are willing to work with the camera's limitations, you will achieve excellent results.  Not for casual 'point and shoot' photographers!","I'm a bit late in writing this review since I've had my SD9 for one year.<br /><br />The image quality of photos using the SD9 can be quite stunning.  The level of sharpness achieved by the Foveon sensor is amazing - it can resolve detail that Bayer sensor cameras (all other digital cameras fall into this group) simply cannot.  Couple this camera with one of Sigma's \"EX\" lenses, particularly the super-sharp 50mm EX macro lens, and you'll love the results.  I enjoy macro photography and this camera is excellent at macro photography.<br /><br />I'm certainly not in the league of a real photographer as I'm just a casual type who enjoys taking pictures.  As they say, the proof is in the picture and I've seen the proof!  Forget about the megapixel rating and the fact that the Sigma is \"only\" 3.4 MP.  The Foveon sensor has 3.4 million photosensors for each primary color - that's 10.2 total MP - while a 6 MP Bayer sensor has 6 MP for all three primary colors.<br /><br />Why a four star rating rather than five?  This camera is not without it's issues, like all cameras.  The SD9 is not a very good low-light performer.  If you need ISO speeds faster than 100 then the SD9 may not be for you.  High ISO shots are noisy although you can get very usable high ISO photos if the conditions are ideal.  The SD10 addressed this issue.  The SD9 does not have a built-in flash but those units are not suitable for serious flash work anyway.  This camera can only use Sigma SA mount lense so the choice in lenses is not as wide as for a Canon, Nikon, or Minolta user but Sigma makes some very, very good lenses and they certainly offer more choices than I can avail myself of.  If you want in-camera jpg files, look elsehwere.  The SD9 shoots only in RAW format and you have to process the photos.  This is actually the best way to shoot, there is so much that can be done with a RAW file that one cannot do with a TIFF or jpg.  The Sigma Photo Pro software is a gem of an application that is extremely powerful and easy to use.<br /><br />Again, look at the results and you'll see that this camera is an extremely capable performer.","i have had this camera for almost 2 years now and am still in love with it.  i use the EX series 15-30mm lens and there isn't a situation i have found where this camera doesn't kick the [...] of any other digital camera (except for maybe the new SD10).  i have a friend with a Canon that cost a ridiculous $9,000 and her pictures look like junk in comparison.  i recently took a photo i took with my SD9 at a canyon in new mexico and had it blown up to over 3 feet wide.  of course, the file size is absolutely huge, but the print out is stunning.  you cannot even see the pixels.<br />i love this camera.  it is amazingy easy to use and the pictures come out wonderfully.","Well, this camera is something special and I have been  compelled write this review because of couple of reasons. For the first, here the reasons. I read many bad , negative reviews of this camera and in the same time all those people who actually used it told how much they have being amazed by the picture quality it produces. So I've decided to try. The camera's images are not amazed they are stunned. The image quality is so high that it left me speechless for the first.<br />I'm just wandering about those who left negative reviews about it? The CNET review, that named it \"mediocre SLR camera\" is just a plain lie. In my opinion they giving point for those who gives more money, it's it. Another interesting \"review\", I read from Ken Rockwell (really gifted photo artist!, no questions!), who reviewed this camera without even try it!<br />So let start. First of all, it is NOT 3.5M camera. It is AT LEAST 10M camera, but megapixels in the traditional meaning just are not applicable here. This camera produces NEGATIVES. This negative is result of 10M photo elements. In the same time any of 6M cameras has HALF OF THEM GREEN and ONLY 25% red and another 25% blue. If we speak about \"image quality\" using this kind of \"resolution\" , this camera produces 14M images. In the same time the \"real\" resolution of those \"6M\" cameras stand about 1.5M, the everything else is a pure deceiving interpolation. I see that Cannon and NIkon, aren't  happy to see this Sigma on the market, since it MUCH SUPERIOR to any camera they make they started to discredit it.<br />I do not say it is an ideal, but it close. Much closer than everything else that feels like SLR.<br />This Sigma produces PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES. I mean it. There's full range of amazing continuos beautiful halftones as you can see on the best reversible films. The pictures are spectacular.<br />Since it is real photographic tool, you come back to the true that photography and it is about light. Your raw pictures will normally produce 3000 by 4500 huge images that is not interpolating, they just \"enlargements\" from digital negative. It reviles as many details that ANY other camera can't produce. There are 14M cameras on the market, but they DO NOT MUCH this SIgma in the meaning of photography. I can blow my raw image 4 times more and it still looking better than those from 14M Canon. By the way, those image from Cannon show horrible color reproduction, especially in the red. For example two closely colored redish colors coming out the same!<br />This Sigma saves colors! It saves the real colors, not the estimations, not the interpolations but the real thing. Camera has just the everything that it has to have, including the high speed synchronization up to 1/6000 !!!<br />The lens from Sigma just as good(or better) as any other lenses from Nikon , Cannon or Minolta. Even cheap $100 tag slow glass is of very good optical quality. Yes/ for $100 you're getting slow lenses, but it almost distortion free and high contrast! But fro $300 you can get perfectly fast, noticeably bright zoom that at least as good as any lens from \"leading companies\".<br />Camera is very well constructed, it handles as it should be, the focusing system is fast, the screen is bright and clear, all controls location are very clever and logical. I like this camera and you're going to like it too. No boundaries anymore. You can print image as large as you need, no questions. In two, three years Foveon will overcome. I","Given reasonable light, this DSLR bests all others in overall image quality with its 10.2M sensors and astounding sharpness. The best digital portrait camera in existence.<br />Don't be fooled by the camera's 3.5MP rating--that is non-interpolated--all other digital camera manufactures, including all DSLRs, list only interpolated resolutions as their MP rating. This inflates other cameras' MP rating by a factor of 3 times relative to the SD-9, since they count each Red, Green, and Blue sensor as a sigle \"pixel.\" The SD-9 counts a full set of three sensors, one Red, one Green, and one Blue, as a single \"pixel.\"  Foveon.com claims the SD-9's image quality bests film for any given capture area, and approaches medium format film quality for enlargements up to 40 inches. Some report that sharp enlargements up to 8 feet on the long side are possible from the SD-9's interpolated 14MP output files. The camera's software is the best available.  The SD-9 always works losslessly, so be sure to compare only RAW mode specs when comparing to other DSLR's operating speed and convenience of workflow.<br />Price is amazingly low for a DSLR with so many sensors, now below [$$$]...Hopefully Amazon.com will match them soon.<br />Not the best DSLR for low light--low light noise is a  weakness. Still, can produce very fine low light/night pics with experience.","I'm basically a point and shoot kinda guy. Before this I owned a run of the mill Olympus D-490.<br />Wow, what a difference. I've been snapping away for over 2 weeks with this little gem and am shocked at the picture quality. It's amazing what a little jump in technology can do. This X3 chip produces great color, fantastic detail and it's easy enough to have running in minutes, providing you have all the batteries, and it takes alot.<br />The downsides are that it's heavy, like a couple of pounds w/ the lens and flash (sold separately). It's expensive, try shelling out 1.5k USD and telling your wife it's for a camera. Ouch.<br />It requires Sigma software - I think if your going to charge an arm and a leg for a camera, it should take images in a standardized format. I appreciate the fact that the images in \"sigma\" format are infinitely manipulatable, but geesh. At least give us a choice if we want all that control in every shot.<br />The pics cant be blown up very much. Now as an aside, I'm no master with the software yet, but on Hi quality with autofocus on the darn thing makes great pics, but viewing at anything over 2:1 magnification in Paint Shop produces pixelated images. It's a quirk, but it matters to me.<br />Other than that, like I said, images are great.

It works well, althought the biggest memory you can purchase is 128 MB. The manufacturers discontinued making this kind of memory cards, and the cards are really expensive. If you are looking to buy a camera with smaller memory this camera would be perfect. It also works well as a webcam.","As a professional photographer I don't rely on pocket cameras to do my more ambitious photography, but I do like to have a pocket camera handy with me all the time so I can take advantage of those photo opportunities that arise when I don't have my larger, heavier gear with me.  For the past 5 years, I've been using a Fuji 6800Z to fill this role and I was generally pleased with it.  There were a few drawbacks (noise in low light, lack of any manual functions, sometimes felt awkward in my hand, didn't like the menu system), but generally I'd say it surved my pocket camera needs well for five years before finally dying (camera function died).  I kept using the camera's voice recording mode (Over 2  hours in wav files {1 hour max each} on 64mb card) for several more months before I decided it was time to replace the whole unit with a new pocket cam and possible new voice recorder.<br /><br />I had decided I didn't want to spend more than $150 on a pocket camera and was QUITE surprised to stumble on the Fuji F601 in a national camera store near where I lived.  Originally priced at $500 (and I've seen them on line for as much as $700), the camera I got had been marked down to $105, new in the original box.  Once I'd determined that the body was metal and it shot 3 or more megapixels, I decided to go ahead, assuming the features would be similar to or less than what I'd had in the 6800 as that model had cost around $800 when I purchased it in 2001.<br /><br />Well, when I got the camera home, I was VERY surprised to find that this unit had MORE features than my 6800, MOST of which were things I had sorely missed in the 6800.  And the things that the 6800 had that the 601 doesn't were things I never used (file locking, etc.).  Allow me to enumerate:<br /><br />LENS - both have f8.3-24.9mm 3x zoom lens, but 601 allows use of 2.8 aperture throughout zoom range where 6800 didn't.<br /><br />APERTURE - both 2.8 to 8.0, but see above.<br /><br />ISO - 6800> 100,200,400  601> 160,200,400 (all sizes) 800,1600 (1 Megapixel only)<br /><br />MENU - I prefer the 601's style menu a lot, but not all do.<br /><br />OPERATING MODES - To the modes the 6800 had, the 601 adds Fully Manual, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Program.  For creative photographers, this is a HUGE plus, giving us the ability to select the shutter speed, aperture size or both when our shooting goals demand it.<br /><br />FOCUS - The 6800 had a fixed focus pointer while in some modes the 601's focus pointer can be moved.<br /><br />BODY - Smaller, and yet, somehow, even with largish man's hands, this model is EASIER to hold than the 6800.<br /><br />VOICE RECORDER - The 6800 allowed for long recordings of voice only with a max file size of 1 hour.  The 601 removes this limit, allowing recording of the full capacity of the memory card in one file.  More convenient for those of us who do a lot of this.  Sound quality was about the same as the 6800, which, while not great, was more than adequate for my needs.<br /><br />In all other respects, the 601 seems to be as good as or better than the 6800.<br /><br />SHOOTING RESULTS - When I began taking pictures with it (3mp mode, I never both with the 6mp mode) I was pleasantly surprised to find that the 601 takes better pictures with less noise and truer colors.  I'm delighted with the output from this camera.  And for $105, I'm just AMAZED at what I have for such a small price.<br /><br />USB CONNECTION - I didn't bother with the docking station as I'm very mobile and the docking station is just one more thing to lug around.  I find the USB cable works fine with no problems whatsoever (physical or operational) on my Windows XP Pro laptop or my girlfriend's XP Home Edition desk top.  I've read that some people had trouble with this and I'm not sure why.  I can only think perhaps they forgot to install the drivers for the camera or the drivers got corrupted, as I had NO issues at all downloading images to either of our XP machines.<br /><br />BATTERY - as with the 6800, the 601 comes with a Lithium Ion battery ... charges quickly and lasts long.<br /><br />WRISTS STRAP - The strap on the 6800 was a rubberized thing that never felt quite big enough or quite right in my grip.  The 601's strap is a sturdy fabric strap that feels better and fits my wrists size better.<br /><br />I invite anyone who is considering purchasing this camera to e-mail me with questions as I just love it and would enjoy discussing it.","Hello ALL<br />Can any one guide me on how to reset the camera????<br />I have been using Finepix F601 Zoom serial number 2ML26749 around a year and have run into a problem.

It also came with an extra memory card.  I love the size - the upright design takes a little getting used to - but I'm getting there.  Photos are clear and crisp, the menu is easy to use and figure out. Options abound, and I just don't think I'll ever buy another brand of digital camera.  Fuji gets high marks from me for several reasons.  Most importantly - they use readily available smart cards - and they stay with them.  I can use all my old accessories from my starter cam - the finepix 1300 - which saves a bundle in the long run.  I am glad that the battery is lithium - I have heard that it lasts even longer than previous fuji batteries - and I bought a spare on ebay rather cheaply - as a backup.  I've only had it a week and I can't say enough about it.  I look forward to using it until it's time to upgrade to my third fuji.","...  I owned a FinePix6800 for over two years, although I have sold the unit, and replaced it with a Canon PowerShot S400 for reasons of preference, not dissatisfaction. The 6800 served me well, and is now servicing a friend who bought it from me.  Although I have never used the F601 but have saw it. The unit is slightly smaller than the 6800. Both cameras use the same SCCD which interpolates 3MP to 6MP, however the F601 probably has an improved version of this CCD.  The problem with the interpolation is it does cause digital noise, especially on night shots with slower shutter speeds.  This is due to the heat that the CCD generates, so mostly I shot in 3MP mode. The noise generated does not [ruin] the shot, but it is noticable.  Shooting day time shots, the noise is less apparent if non-existant. As for the zoom feature, like all digital cameras, don't use digital zoom if possible, stick with optical as the shot tend to get grainey.  Now if I understand correctly, and the other reviews are accurate, the F601 doesn't come with a docking cradle, the 6800 did.  This is a convenience that is needed.  Check on this before making the purchase. Other considerations would be with the F601 itself.  The 6800 came with a Mini Movie Mode of 160 seconds, the F601 can only do 66 seconds.  The 6800 came with a 2\" LCD the F601 has a 1.5\" perhaps this is to decrease power consumption, but why the shortened movie times??  I also noticed that the settings knob has been placed at an angle on top of the camera the 6800 has it placed on the upper front in a vertical position next to the shutter button.  This allows for easier manipulation of the settings, but this may just be a preference of mine, as I can see the LCD at the same time.  Before you buy, check both cameras out, and for those of you who are buying a digital for the first time, both the 6800 & F601 will take some getting used to due to the vertical design. Overall these are nice cameras, but in no way should they be considered pocket cameras, due to the weight of the units.  Buy a nice padded case like the ones made by Lowepro or Tamrac Digital Series, and attach it to your belt or use the shoulder strap.  One waist high drop on concrete, and you can say Aloha to your brand new camera.<br />PS  The 4 star rating is due to reduction of the movie mode, and smaller LCD screen.  If the unit doesn't come with a docking cradle out of the box it's a 3.  I don't understand why less would be an improvement, except in costs. And because of the falling prices of digitals, I paid [dollar amount] for the 6800 in 2000, for [dollar amount] MSRP, you should get at least what I got in 2003 if not more!","I have owned two Fujifilm FinePix 6300 cameras in the past and was thrilled with their capabilities.  When the F601 became available, it was a no-brainer for me to upgrade to it.  The resilution is great, it is sturdy camera that I'm not afraid to take with me everywhere, and the pictures are incredable.  The only complaint that I have about all of the Fuji's that I've had is that they don't fit my hand (large hands) as well as a 35mm style camera would.  In my opinion, the F601 is a fantastic camera.","This camera is great.  I find it unfortunate that the 2 reviewers who rated t so low got what are obviously rare lemons.  I love the camera.  It is easy to use and very convenient.  I find myself taking it eveywhere.  The only downside is that at first it is awkward to hold due to it's small size and upright design.  You get used to it very quick though.  This is my first digital camera.  It is kind of expensive but got mine on sale, so I lucked out.  Overall, great camera.  Get one today, along with a 128MB card.","When I started looking for a digital camera my first thoughts were to get a Fuji 6900.  I realized I normally declined to bring along my 35MM because of it's size so I started looking for a smaller camera that I could slip in a pocket.  The FUJI A601 is a great camera for the average person.  After purchasing I took it home and read the one page instruction \"cheat sheet\", charged the camera and immediately started taking pictures even though I'd never used a digital camera before. It is very easy to use and I take it just about every where due to it's small size.  After my last trip, I realized some of my photos were slightly blurry so I finally dug out the instruction manaul and read it.  I now take crisp, clear photos every time.  I recommend buying the 128MB smartcard and the cradle as I've found both of them very beneficial.","The F601 is a great camera!  I donot know why one of the previous reviewers complained that this or the optional cradle do not work with Windows XP.  It works and installed very easily for me on XP.  Maybe they should read the manual before trying to install.  Anyway picture quality seems to be wonderful in 1MP or 3MP modes, some pictures appear blurry, but i think this is just because i am getting used to this camera. Battery life is average or a little better than average.  Again i don't know what the previous reviewer has used before but i do not know a single digital camera that will fill up a 128mb card.  For instance the Canon S330 battery only lasts about 1 hour!  This battery is certainly better than that but i would by a second battery if you can afford it.  Video mode works great and is only limited to the amount of space you have free on your smartmedia card.  Bottom Line is this camera creates great pictures, is extremely fast starting up and zooming(especially compared to the Minolta F100, which seemed very slow) and movie mode works great.  It also has full manual controls.  Downsides seem to be initially that the redeye reduction does not seem to work all that well(although this can be fixed with photoshop) and the price, which is more expensive than most 3MP Cameras. The only thing i am concerned with is the negative reviews about quality, the camera seems very well made and solid and so far i have had no problems.","The camera was ok.

Originally priced at $500 (and I've seen them on line for as much as $700), the camera I got had been marked down to $105, new in the original box.  Once I'd determined that the body was metal and it shot 3 or more megapixels, I decided to go ahead, assuming the features would be similar to or less than what I'd had in the 6800 as that model had cost around $800 when I purchased it in 2001.<br /><br />Well, when I got the camera home, I was VERY surprised to find that this unit had MORE features than my 6800, MOST of which were things I had sorely missed in the 6800.  And the things that the 6800 had that the 601 doesn't were things I never used (file locking, etc.).  Allow me to enumerate:<br /><br />LENS - both have f8.3-24.9mm 3x zoom lens, but 601 allows use of 2.8 aperture throughout zoom range where 6800 didn't.<br /><br />APERTURE - both 2.8 to 8.0, but see above.<br /><br />ISO - 6800> 100,200,400  601> 160,200,400 (all sizes) 800,1600 (1 Megapixel only)<br /><br />MENU - I prefer the 601's style menu a lot, but not all do.<br /><br />OPERATING MODES - To the modes the 6800 had, the 601 adds Fully Manual, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Program.  For creative photographers, this is a HUGE plus, giving us the ability to select the shutter speed, aperture size or both when our shooting goals demand it.<br /><br />FOCUS - The 6800 had a fixed focus pointer while in some modes the 601's focus pointer can be moved.<br /><br />BODY - Smaller, and yet, somehow, even with largish man's hands, this model is EASIER to hold than the 6800.<br /><br />VOICE RECORDER - The 6800 allowed for long recordings of voice only with a max file size of 1 hour.  The 601 removes this limit, allowing recording of the full capacity of the memory card in one file.  More convenient for those of us who do a lot of this.  Sound quality was about the same as the 6800, which, while not great, was more than adequate for my needs.<br /><br />In all other respects, the 601 seems to be as good as or better than the 6800.<br /><br />SHOOTING RESULTS - When I began taking pictures with it (3mp mode, I never both with the 6mp mode) I was pleasantly surprised to find that the 601 takes better pictures with less noise and truer colors.  I'm delighted with the output from this camera.  And for $105, I'm just AMAZED at what I have for such a small price.<br /><br />USB CONNECTION - I didn't bother with the docking station as I'm very mobile and the docking station is just one more thing to lug around.  I find the USB cable works fine with no problems whatsoever (physical or operational) on my Windows XP Pro laptop or my girlfriend's XP Home Edition desk top.  I've read that some people had trouble with this and I'm not sure why.  I can only think perhaps they forgot to install the drivers for the camera or the drivers got corrupted, as I had NO issues at all downloading images to either of our XP machines.<br /><br />BATTERY - as with the 6800, the 601 comes with a Lithium Ion battery ... charges quickly and lasts long.<br /><br />WRISTS STRAP - The strap on the 6800 was a rubberized thing that never felt quite big enough or quite right in my grip.  The 601's strap is a sturdy fabric strap that feels better and fits my wrists size better.<br /><br />I invite anyone who is considering purchasing this camera to e-mail me with questions as I just love it and would enjoy discussing it.","Hello ALL<br />Can any one guide me on how to reset the camera????<br />I have been using Finepix F601 Zoom serial number 2ML26749 around a year and have run into a problem. The Camera now doesnot power up anymore. The last working state before the problem occurred was as follows:<br />1.  Connected the camera to the Picture Cradle .<br />2.  Connected the cradle to Windows XP PC (Home edition) via USB<br />3.  Powered on the Camera<br />4.  Windows Task Manager prompts that a digitalk Camera is connected and display avaible options<br />5.  Select Copy pictures from Camera to HDD<br />6.  After Copying the pictures from the camera to HDD, We shut down the XP leaving the Camera Powered on and in \"access via USB\" State which was indicated by a USB icon on its display.<br />After the PC was shut down, the camera couldnot be powered off and hence leaving the only option to remove the camera from cradle and remove the battery manually from its compartment. Ever since I am unable to power the camera unit. I tried to replace the memory and battery but of not use.<br />Please email at rvinukonda@juniper.net","After starting with a 1300 - I lucked out and found this camera on another web site - I got the camera AND the charger at an amazing price.  It also came with an extra memory card.  I love the size - the upright design takes a little getting used to - but I'm getting there.  Photos are clear and crisp, the menu is easy to use and figure out. Options abound, and I just don't think I'll ever buy another brand of digital camera.  Fuji gets high marks from me for several reasons.  Most importantly - they use readily available smart cards - and they stay with them.  I can use all my old accessories from my starter cam - the finepix 1300 - which saves a bundle in the long run.  I am glad that the battery is lithium - I have heard that it lasts even longer than previous fuji batteries - and I bought a spare on ebay rather cheaply - as a backup.  I've only had it a week and I can't say enough about it.  I look forward to using it until it's time to upgrade to my third fuji.","...  I owned a FinePix6800 for over two years, although I have sold the unit, and replaced it with a Canon PowerShot S400 for reasons of preference, not dissatisfaction. The 6800 served me well, and is now servicing a friend who bought it from me.  Although I have never used the F601 but have saw it. The unit is slightly smaller than the 6800. Both cameras use the same SCCD which interpolates 3MP to 6MP, however the F601 probably has an improved version of this CCD.  The problem with the interpolation is it does cause digital noise, especially on night shots with slower shutter speeds.  This is due to the heat that the CCD generates, so mostly I shot in 3MP mode. The noise generated does not [ruin] the shot, but it is noticable.  Shooting day time shots, the noise is less apparent if non-existant. As for the zoom feature, like all digital cameras, don't use digital zoom if possible, stick with optical as the shot tend to get grainey.  Now if I understand correctly, and the other reviews are accurate, the F601 doesn't come with a docking cradle, the 6800 did.  This is a convenience that is needed.  Check on this before making the purchase. Other considerations would be with the F601 itself.  The 6800 came with a Mini Movie Mode of 160 seconds, the F601 can only do 66 seconds.  The 6800 came with a 2\" LCD the F601 has a 1.5\" perhaps this is to decrease power consumption, but why the shortened movie times??  I also noticed that the settings knob has been placed at an angle on top of the camera the 6800 has it placed on the upper front in a vertical position next to the shutter button.  This allows for easier manipulation of the settings, but this may just be a preference of mine, as I can see the LCD at the same time.  Before you buy, check both cameras out, and for those of you who are buying a digital for the first time, both the 6800 & F601 will take some getting used to due to the vertical design. Overall these are nice cameras, but in no way should they be considered pocket cameras, due to the weight of the units.  Buy a nice padded case like the ones made by Lowepro or Tamrac Digital Series, and attach it to your belt or use the shoulder strap.  One waist high drop on concrete, and you can say Aloha to your brand new camera.<br />PS  The 4 star rating is due to reduction of the movie mode, and smaller LCD screen.  If the unit doesn't come with a docking cradle out of the box it's a 3.  I don't understand why less would be an improvement, except in costs. And because of the falling prices of digitals, I paid [dollar amount] for the 6800 in 2000, for [dollar amount] MSRP, you should get at least what I got in 2003 if not more!","I have owned two Fujifilm FinePix 6300 cameras in the past and was thrilled with their capabilities.  When the F601 became available, it was a no-brainer for me to upgrade to it.  The resilution is great, it is sturdy camera that I'm not afraid to take with me everywhere, and the pictures are incredable.  The only complaint that I have about all of the Fuji's that I've had is that they don't fit my hand (large hands) as well as a 35mm style camera would.  In my opinion, the F601 is a fantastic camera.","This camera is great.  I find it unfortunate that the 2 reviewers who rated t so low got what are obviously rare lemons.  I love the camera.  It is easy to use and very convenient.  I find myself taking it eveywhere.  The only downside is that at first it is awkward to hold due to it's small size and upright design.  You get used to it very quick though.  This is my first digital camera.  It is kind of expensive but got mine on sale, so I lucked out.  Overall, great camera.  Get one today, along with a 128MB card.","When I started looking for a digital camera my first thoughts were to get a Fuji 6900.  I realized I normally declined to bring along my 35MM because of it's size so I started looking for a smaller camera that I could slip in a pocket.  The FUJI A601 is a great camera for the average person.  After purchasing I took it home and read the one page instruction \"cheat sheet\", charged the camera and immediately started taking pictures even though I'd never used a digital camera before. It is very easy to use and I take it just about every where due to it's small size.  After my last trip, I realized some of my photos were slightly blurry so I finally dug out the instruction manaul and read it.  I now take crisp, clear photos every time.  I recommend buying the 128MB smartcard and the cradle as I've found both of them very beneficial.","The F601 is a great camera!  I donot know why one of the previous reviewers complained that this or the optional cradle do not work with Windows XP.  It works and installed very easily for me on XP.  Maybe they should read the manual before trying to install.  Anyway picture quality seems to be wonderful in 1MP or 3MP modes, some pictures appear blurry, but i think this is just because i am getting used to this camera. Battery life is average or a little better than average.  Again i don't know what the previous reviewer has used before but i do not know a single digital camera that will fill up a 128mb card.  For instance the Canon S330 battery only lasts about 1 hour!  This battery is certainly better than that but i would by a second battery if you can afford it.  Video mode works great and is only limited to the amount of space you have free on your smartmedia card.  Bottom Line is this camera creates great pictures, is extremely fast starting up and zooming(especially compared to the Minolta F100, which seemed very slow) and movie mode works great.  It also has full manual controls.  Downsides seem to be initially that the redeye reduction does not seem to work all that well(although this can be fixed with photoshop) and the price, which is more expensive than most 3MP Cameras. The only thing i am concerned with is the negative reviews about quality, the camera seems very well made and solid and so far i have had no problems.","There are many things that really make this camera worth buying.  These are a few that sold me:<br />1) Form factor - The 601 has got a really nice upright shape that lends itself to smaller hands.<br />2) Controls - The basic point-and-shoot controls are very easy to manipulate.  Switching between Movie, Auto Control, and Manual Control is a cinch and zooming and focusing is a breeze.<br />3) Picture quality - The pictures that are produced are almost always true to life.  Even at 1 megapixel normal mode, the pictures are sharp and clear.<br />But since I bought it, there have been a few niggling inconsistencies and drawbacks that take the sheen off the thing.<br />1) No picture stabilization - If you have jittery hands, you will end up with lots of fuzzy pictures.<br />2) A bug in the lens retraction system causes my camera to not stow the zoom lens when I turn it off.<br />3) Complicated menus - Once you decide to leave the familiar point-and-shoot environment and start fiddling with apertures and f stops, the menus become very complicated.<br />4) FinePix software - If you can avoid it, just don't install it.  It is slow and heavy.  I suggest getting another imaging suite like Photoshop Elements or Macromedia Fireworks or Jasc PaintShop Pro.<br />5) Short battery life - At 1 megapixel normal mode, it is almost impossible to fill up a 128Meg SmartMedia card.  The battery in this case lasts about 3 hours.  This annoyance is offset by the fact that 128M is enough to fit about 400 pictures.  I ran out of battery the other day, which is why I bring this up.  If you are used to shooting 30-40 shots a day, then there is plenty of battery.<br />Still, it is a cool little camera that takes really good pictures and is small enough to take with you on your next outing.  The price is a little high and you would do yourself right to compare this to other cameras in its range.  The form factor may look cool now, but you should try it out before buying, some people really don't like the shape.","Finding this remarkable camera and the opportunity to go digital, I took the plunge and bought what my daughter( a newspaper reporter/photographer) thought was a better digital than her newspaper had.  We analyzed all the options and decided that since I had eye surgery the LCD was mandatory and she wanted the ease of storing many pics as the sportsscene we haunt not only has my youngest son as a player but the county teams benefit from clearer higher density photos.  We planned on using the 601 for action shots at sports events but it is super with children's photos too.  Having many grandchildren I am thrilled with the wonderful unposed action shots of little ones. As sports events and scrapbookers we use the advantages of this digital to the max.  Thankyou for creating such a wonderful camera for a first time digital user.  AS a sports photograper, my daughter is having a winderful time with action shots and the ability of the zoom creates AP Wire quality.  We need an extra battery and need advice as to where to get one along with a BC-60 battery charger.  Since my daughter doesn't have her own computer when she takes the camera for a few days she needs a charger to make sure she has enough power for events.  Thanks for promoting such excitement in our lives.","I started with a Fujifilm MX-700 four years ago as my first digital camera, and I waited until now to upgrade to the F601, which is essentially the 4th generation version of the MX-700.  It has the same stylish (even better looking and a bit smaller) aluminum housing, and the features are now an order of magnitude better.  The F601 image processing is fast--only about 2-3 seconds between pictures (even at hi-res), and the image quality is excellent.  I figured out the camera controls in about 5 minutes without reading the manual at all--they are very intuitive.  The full-VGA 15 frame-per-second video capture mode is also great for mini-movies, and you are only limited by the size of your smart card on the movie length.  Many other cameras only do quarter-VGA (QVGA) videos with a 30-second limit.  Plus, like the other reviewer said, the F601 fits inconspicuously into a front pants pocket, so you can take it anywhere.  Caveats:  I don't like that the file numbering resets to zero each time you clear the smart card.  That makes it difficult to download all of your pictures to the same file folder.  Even my MX-700 had an option not to reset the file numbering, so I'm not sure what the Fujifilm engineers were thinking.  Also, you have to learn how to hold the camera, because it is easy to block the microphone or the flash or the exposure meter with a finger.  Finally, you'll want to fork over the money for an extra battery and a 128 MB smartcard.  But those are small quibbles.  This is a great camera for beginners and experts alike.  I love mine.","As a media teacher in a prep school, I've handled many digital and 35mm cameras in my day, but after only a week with this one, the others have gone into storage.  This camera takes excellent, print-quality 8x10 pictures with a minuimum of fuss in automatic setting, toggles easily and intuitively between picture taking and archived picture viewing, and interfaces cleanly with my PC laptop without the extra-cost Fuji 601 cradle.  4x zoom is clear, and defaults of either 1 or 3 megapixel fine-quality pictures easily rival true analog photography for clarity and color.<br />I don't recommend using the 6-megapixel \"dithered\" settings, as the color and pixel dithering is visible at standard photo sizes.  I HIGHLY recommend getting a 128M storage card, though; you can only store 5 3 megapixel fine-quality images on the 16meg card that comes with the camera.<br />Settings are easily changed and accessed, and include grids and focus variations for assistance with framing the best shot.  More advanced manual features are conparatively thorough.  Accompanying software is easy to install and integrates well with the PC operating system without interfering with default user settings (as so often can be the case!).  Images are stored in easy-to-use jpeg format.<br />A vertical camera where most traditional models are longer-than-wide, its physical design takes a few seconds to get used to, but once one overcomes the tendency to block lens and/or flash sensor, holding the camera becomes is a light, comfortable, and ergonomically sound experience.  The battery lasts a long time (about 150 pix) but takes up little space or weight.<br />The camera does take limited video, but this isn't designed to be a video camera or even much of a hybrid -- it saves in .avi, which is useful, but can't store more than a few minutes even on the 128meg card.  As an added bonus, though, audio functions abound.  The traditional voice-recorded .wav funtion seems both useful and something I will actually USE; even better, the 601 has a very cool setting which allows you to append a 30 second voice \"tag\" to every picture you take, making the old-school photographers logbook a thing of the past, and allowing you to archive data about one shot while framing the next.<br />A gift from family on the eve of our first child's arrival, the F601 leads the pack, leaving me confident that we won't miss a shot in crowded and possible darkened birthing-room conditions.  What better recommendation could one want?","I used to get FinePix 6800; luckily I stopped and wait.  The FinePix F601 offers a better design than 6800 and is lighter, easier to use; good for a lazy guy like me.  It's enhanced Super CCD technology makes the quality of picture even better.  While using the default mode of shoot (1MB at 1280x960, normal) is good enough for a 5R picture, the max. resolution (2832x2128, fine) gives you incredibly good poster print.  In addition to that, the single control button lets you set up the machine easily, provided your hand point steadily.  All in all, when you want to get FujiFilm, consider F601 instead of 6800.","I have been researching digital photography technology for quiet some time now and was waiting for very high resolution cameras to become more mainstream before I made the transition from a Canon EOS Elan IIe SLR.  I realized over time that very high resolution cameras take up too much memory, and time to write and frankly unless you go for prints that are over 10 x 14 you do not need it.  If you go for prints over 10 x 14 you also need a wide format printer(most printers don't have that sort of capability) or sending them out which costs.  So you must truly assess what size you will be printing most.  What sold me on this camera: a. very good to excellent resolution and color saturation particularly outdoors even for larger prints b. size (it is incredible I carry it with me everywhere while that was not the case with my other camera) c. takes full VGA movie clips (with great sound) lack of zooming is not a problem you hardly need it (go for a full video camera if you need extensive control of video) d. voice notes (I have not used it but is is nice to know it is there) e. ease of use and most importantly fuji has imporved the algorithm for light processing and it seems if you compare photos taken by the FUJI 6800 versus the Finepix F601 the photos have light much better balanced while the FUJI 6800 photos look conistently a bit dark.  Features that dissapoint: like every other camera the 16MB card only holds 5 full resolution pics so you must buy a larger card (I bought a 128mb one for [money]), the cradle which acts as a recharger, syncing (to upload the photos to the computer) and to play the video on TV is extra unlike previous models.  Of course this is a point and shoot camera so don't expect to find any external flash syncing capability but you will find that you don't need it most of the time unless you are shooting professionally.  Finally I used to hate point and shoot cameras but one must understand that the technology in the digital cameras goes far beyond the capability and control of 35mm film point and shoot cameras. This camera keeps me content with numerous adjustments from shutter speed, to aperture to EV so although it comes in a small package it does not compromise on picture taking fine tuning."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix S602 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["We were surpised how easy and wonderful this camera operates.

You can't really compare it to someting like a Nikon D2H because it's in a completely different price class.  First, I've been shooting professionally for a few years, and about 15 years in total.  I know 35mm cameras.  The Fuji, by far, has produced the most realistic and useful images of any digital camera that I've tried.  It also offers the lowest number of images that need to be retouched.  The previous comments about build quality should be taken with a grain of salt.  The camera can withstand pro use, as long as you are not into moutain biking or extreme sports, you should be fine.  The user interface is somewhat intuitive, but it does take a little getting used to - just like any other camera out there.  Nothing has been \"jury rigged\" - this camera is built on the Nikon N80 (I have one) and both cameras are light but have a solid feel.  They are well built cameras.<br />Overall image quality is excellent.  Skin tones are right on.  I have very few, if any, white balance issues using my SB-80DX flash units.  I never use the on board flash - they stink regardless of what camera you use, it's only for emergencies.  If you are looking to buy a digital camera useful for shooting weddings, portraits, etc, this is a good camera for you.  It's imperative you put good glass on this camera (f2.8 or brighter).  The BEST lens for the money on this camera is Nikon's 50mm f1.8 AF-D.  It gives about the same perspective as a fine 85mm portrait lens.  If you can afford them, the AF-S lenses on this camera are outstanding. The only drawbacks I've experienced is AF speed can be slow with normal lenses (no AF-S) and Fuji's software takes some getting used to, especially if you shoot in RAW format.  Prices have not dropped recently on this camera - it has a large following of Nikon shooters out there, and a TON of professionals are using this camera in the studio and on assignment.","I have owned one for 4 months now and am very pleased with it.  The reviewer that claims it can't take sharp photos is an idiot (he is no doubt the problem).  I have seen 30x40 prints shot with this (by Will Crockett) and they were amazing.  If you love Fuji film you will love the way this camera \"sees\". Fuji has tuned their software and electronics to record images with that fuji look.  Sure the body is plastic but I'm more interested in the quality of images and the images are simply the best.<br /><br />10/04 I've now owned this camera over a year, I've had no problems and have am still very pleased.  Battery set-up could be better,and will be in the up-coming S3, but the this camera is all about image quality and I still believe it's the best of the bunch.<br /><br />1/05 - Sold this camera last month.  Image quality was great but needing two type of batteries, and highh energy consumption are a major pain.  The CCD died on me, in the summer, while on a job, but was replaced by Fuji free of charge.  I'm awaiting my d200's arrival.  As happy as I am I'm glad to see it go.<br /><br />2/05  I have my D200 now and really love it.  Higher battery consumption than my d70s but of course it also has a larger brighter monitor.  check out the D200, it rocks!<br /><br />2/07 I love my D200 but still think the Fuji sensor results are closer to film and I look forward to the upcoming S5.  The D200 body with a Fuji sensor, it should be a great combination","It is very reliable, high quality (as all that Fuji does), produces clean , clear, wonderful images with high tone quality. Camera is easy to operate and logically constructed. I've been using this one for couple of moths and it was really joy to use. It has its drawbacks but they are few and minor. Let say they are not troubles but matter of personal taste with equipment. Definitely recommend it.","Granted the S2 is not built like a tank. It was not billed as such and I suggest that anyone who thinks they need that, chili out the $4.5 K for the D1x or $7 K for the 1Ds.<br />I  purchased mine to be housed for undewater shooting. I have shot mostly macro to this point but will now be shooting WA as well. The color saturation and TTL are incredible and equal in quality to my previous N90s/Provia 100 setup. The S2 is the only camera on the market where the TTL is compatable with underwater strobes. You can see some of my underwater photos at [...] .<br />I have used it extensively top side as well. You can purchase 24 2000 MA AA's for less than $30. I have also purchase the lithiums online 24/$30. This makes this setup very inexpensive and convenient to power. Plus you can purchase AA alkalines anywhere to get you out of a pinch.<br />A 1 GB Compactflash card for under $300 will hold 78 shots in RAW at the highest resolution.","I was using a Nikon D1 previous to purchasing the Fujifilm S2 Pro and I would have to admit that the camera body doesn't compare well to the Nikon pro bodies.<br />After using the S2 Pro since it's introduction and shooting everything from fashion to action rodeo images,I have to say that the image quality (Isn't that what really counts in the long run?)is top notch.For action shots I shoot in high rez JPEG and for everything else I shoot in RAW format.I feel that the 12MP Raw images are every bit as good as any that can be captured on 35mm film.<br />If one is not getting the image quality expected,from the Fujifilm S2Pro,perhaps they should examine the quality of the lenses used.Are they Nikon's Pro lenses? Are they after market lenses? I find that alot of complaints registered for various cameras are the result or either poor lens quality or of poor shooting technique rather than camera quality.<br />Without getting into the $5,000.00+ digital SLR price range,I feel that the S2Pro is the \"Cream Of The Crop\".","I have used many digital camera's and while the body could be designed better over all it has the best color, exposure and auto white balance over the SLR's in its catagory.  In my opinion the 12 megapixel mode doesnt give you 12 megapixel quality but more like 9 megapixel quality which is far better than anything for the price.","The S2 is a great camera. This camera body is a Nikon N80 body which is a high end consumer level camera. The Nikon D100 is based on the same body. What makes this camera a Professional level camera is its CCD sensor. It is far beyond the rest of the 6  mega-pixel cameras out there. There are many hi-level pros that use this for their studio work. I would hesitate to use in a rugged enviroment (i.e. National Geographic on Location, or National Football League EndZone) because it is a plastic body. I challeng anyone to match the results in the studio with a camera that costs less than $3000.00 dollars. Check out Thom Hogan's website for a detailed review and comparison.<br />[...]","Hi, I'm a professional who's making the switch to digital for some things and I bought an S2 to hold me over until the D2H comes out.<br />I want to comment on some of your points:<br />1) The autofocus noise is a characteristic of the lens -- not the camera. A 70-300 sounds like a plane taking off on any camera, not just an S2. I have several silent wave lenses, and they focus as smoothly on the S2 as on my pro film bodies.<br />Also, you mention that the S2 can take 7+ frames per second (FPS)-- actually it can only do 2 FPS. I think you're referring to the D1H.<br />2) I think most digital systems eat batteries. I don't use the rear display often, so I manage several hours from my S2 with the default battery setup that is the camera default.<br />I also use a Quantum battery pack, and have never been disappointed. Sure it's heavy (like you said -- carry an external flash -- the pop-up flash is just as bad as all of the other pop-up flashes out there), but pretty much all modern pro SLR systems are heavy.<br />People wonder why my Nikon FM-2n is still my favorite camera!<br />I'd give the Fuji 5 stars -- the only thing I completely hate is the \"feel\" of the camera. It's \"plasticy\" -- doesn't feel like it has the same build quality as other pro cameras. I wouldn't feel comfortable shooting with it in the rain, for example.<br />If this system was rubber armored, with a little higher build quality, I wouldn't even be considering a D2H next year.","Reviews are usually worthless to people, unless the reviewers tell the readers what is they believe in wrong with the product. I will dispense the experience I recieved while using this camera for a year as the editor of a acclaimed college prep high school's yearbook.<br />The bad:<br />1) The autofocus of the camera can wake the dead. If you're trying to quitely take pictures w/ autofocus, you minus well throw this camera out the window. Not only is the autofocus extremely slow compared to Canon's, but it is extremely loud. People will notice you not because of the camera, but because of the sound. It's a loud grinding of gears. If you're taking 7+ FPS (which this camera can do), the autofocus will almost ALWAYS leave you with 5 or so blurry pictures, and you will invaribly miss a good portion of the action due to the slowness of the gears.<br />2) It eats batteries. While it eats batteries rather quickly, it does not compare to Olympus's E10. That monster will go through 4 AAs (Fully charged, 1800 NIM-H) in less then 45 minutes, WITHOUT the flash. The S2 has a dock loader that holds 4 AAs, and a bottom loader that holds dual lithiums. Should ANY of your batteries fail, the odds are it will render the S2 inoperable. The 4 AAs run the computer in the camera, and the lithiums run the camera itself. The camera will still take pictures should the AAs fail, but without the computer, there is no way to record those pictures...<br />My suggestions: Carry spare lithiums at all times, AND carry a battery pack, such as the ones Quantum makes. Those last for 4 hours at contiunal use, with onboard flash, using 7 FPS every 3 or so minutes. Lithiums, during peak months, we went through 4 every month or so. Meaning, the average person will probably need to change lithiums ever 2 months. However, the weight of a extra battery pack, plus a external flash, will wear you down before you know it.<br />3) The flash is...bad. Not much you can do about it. The flash, like many onboard flashes, highlights certain areas, creating pictures with zones of highly contrasting levels of light. Parts are very dark, while other parts are washed out. Just get a external, there's not much I can say about it.<br />Now just some accessories that you would probably find invaluble.<br />1) 340 IBM microdrive OR 512 SM card<br />Lots of space. This camera, on medium quality produces 2 meg pictures. If you're a shutterbug, you'll find that a 128 meg card is insufficent. However, i would lean towards the SM, because they, as a general rule of thumb, record faster. I've spent 10-15 seconds waiting for 7 pictures to record. Not fun, especially during a waterpolo or soccer game.<br />2) rechargable batteries. Buying 4 Duracell ultras every two weeks is going to cost a arm and a leg. Just shell out $50 for 4 AAs and a good charger, perferable a 1-4 hours. It will be much cheaper in the long run.<br />3) 35 mm lens. Nuff' said.<br />4) 70-300 mm lens, nothing like a telephoto lens to make your day.<br />5) 28-300 mm lens. It's so nice just to carry 1 lens around.<br />6) Filters for your lens. I hate dirty elements, and you never want to touch them. Cleaning a filter is far easier, cheaper and less dramatic.<br />7) A bag, don't get a black one, nor one that says \"Photography\", that's asking people to steal it. heat is the enemy of electronics as well as humidity, get something that reflects as much heat and light as possible.<br />8) A card reader. Even though the firewire is fast, being able to physically pull your card out and move it between comptuers as you do matainece on your camera is invaluble.","This camera equals and in some cases surpasses its' techincal specs. Put the right lens on, 2000 amp re-chargable batteries and a big CF card and there's little you can't do with this camera. I have large, medium and 35mm cameras. Along with the Olympus ZLR 3000, this is my favorite of the bunch. It's comparably heavy, battery-hungry and rich with features that have to be learned. But what it does- such as rendering of sharp digital photos and spot-on skin tones, it does extraordinarly well.","The Fulifilm Finepix S2 Pro improves greatly on the S1.  I shoot  very heavily with this camera, several thousand photos a week and beat the hell out of it.  Having the Nikon constructed N-80 body helps with it's ruggedness, but it is not as sturdy as the D1-X, however it does capture 12.1 Million MegaPixels.  I recommend setting the custom white balance often when attempting to shoot in various lighting conditions to insure optimum accurate colors, otherwise colors may lean toward the red.  Also,  do not trust what you see in the lcd, believe the metering, the display will tend make you want to push a few stops, which is fine if that is the look you are going for, but at first I blew out alot of shots. The ability to use all of my Nikon lenses is a plus, and there are plent of features to play with, so get a big memory card.<br />For the price most digital SLR's cannot touch the file sizes you can get with the S2.  This camera is almost perfect, except....<br />IT EATS BATTERIES, EAT'S 'EM! The camera takes 4 AA's in the loading tray,(which is not the strongest of plastic things I have ever seen and cannot believe that I have not broken it while rushing to trade batteries out on a shoot) and 2 $ 123 lithium ions.  On a full day shoot I go through at least 2 sets of the lithiums and usually 3 with AA(I do always leave it set to LCD preview<to check my lighting>which can be shut off to save juice).  If I use a flash or hook it to any lighting equipment, even worse. They make a fairly expensive power pack for the camera, but for the locations I work in that is not always ideal.<br />Final word cool Professional camera, despite the batteries, but you get more than you pay for in image resolution and picture quality."]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE S404","amazon_reviews":["You can get a lot out of this camera, but it is not a point and shoot.

Although I took great care of my brand new camera, the sand-damage was done and repair not possible according to Minolta.","I have had this camera for a little less than a year and I love it.  There is nothing better than to stuff it into my pocket and go.  It fits everywhere.  It downloads quickly and efficiently on my computer and I never have to worry about taking pictures.  The only problem that has occurred is the battery drains quickly - but what digital doesn't.  I'm going to buy another battery to keep as a backup.  I love this camera because of its compact size and ease in using.","I have a big Olympus digital camera, but found it was too cumbersome for vacation travel and impromptu snapshots and it devoured AA batteries.  This little marvel from Minolta packs almost everything my Olympus does into something about the size of a pack of cigarettes and the miniscule rechargable battery lasts about 2 days of occasional tourist snapshots.  I took it to Venice in March and it worked great.  Picture quality is good for computer and e-mail, although I admit I don't have a great photo printer to truly assess photo quality.  The Minolta image management software is easy to use and does everything the typical user would need to do, such as rotating photos, adjusting brightness, and adjusting color.  After almost 3 months with this camera, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a simple, compact, high-quality digital camera.","I have a big Olympus digital camera, but found it was too cumbersome for vacation travel and impromptu snapshots and it devoured AA batteries.

We bought it as our other digital camera tended to get left at home because of its size. Other features are fun, like making movies up to 35 seconds (though we've found the sound doesn't sync with the motion) and doing continuous shots (one every half-second, good for capturing actions like blowing out candles on a cake).<br />There are some niggles that make this camera less than perfect. The one that bothers me the most is the fact that image labels start from 1 whenever you move the previous photos out of memory. So you take a bunch of pictures, pic00001.jpg, pic00002.jpg, etc., you move these to your computer and delete from your camera, and when you take more images they start again, labelling them pic00001.jpg, etc. It's not a big deal to store sets of images in different directories, but it is a headache if you are trying to make a calendar or otherwise bring in images from different directories together.<br />All in all I'm happy with this camera, but wish they had thought through a few more aspects of their design.","The reason that this camera is better than most, is that you will carry this camera with you all the time. With most cameras, you have to judge when you will bring it with you.<br />If you are the bride or groom at a wedding and you are taking keepsake photos, this is not the camera for you. If you are one of the other 200 at the wedding, this is the perfect camera.<br />This camera is only 3/4\" thick and I read other reviews of people who dont own this camera say that their 2\" thick camera takes a better picture. Probably so...but your camera is most likely still at home taking great pictures of.....nothing. I connect this camera to a Mac with OS X using iPhoto which color corrects all the photos. Insanely easy.<br />This camera also comes as a 3meg version (same size).<br />If the idea of a camera is to take photos, than this camera passes that test with flying colors. You will consider this camera a part of your hand.<br />Like a cell phone, I consider this camera indispensible.<br />This camera has an all metal body unlike most digital cameras that have a plastic body.","Ever since the DiMage X came out I've wanted to get one but I waited until the price dropped.  I got one about a month ago in February. I really like the unique design and its compact size.  Here are some of the pros and cons in my opinion. Lets start with the cons.<br />CONs:<br />- Takes a while to switch from one shooting mode to another (ex: from single shot to movie mode). It is a lot easier on the sony DSC series cameras.<br />- I have gotten use to the small size and learned quickly to becareful about not covering the lens with my finger.  However, when someone else is taking a picture for me, most of the time their finger blocks a portion of the lens.<br />- You can't preview anything if you're taking a picture in low light conditions.  I like how some Sony's shine an orange light before you take the shot so you see what you're taking.<br />- Menu isn't hard to learn but isn't the most efficient style I've seen.<br />Now for the PROs:<br />- I really really like the design of Dimage X. Very modern and unique and just plain cool.<br />- Very small in size and light weight. Everywhere I go its always in my pocket.<br />- Amazingly good zoom (3x optical) for such a small camera. And plus the internal zoom design allows the small camera to stay small all the time.<br />- The battery life is very good.  I always have the LCD screen on when I use the camera and I haven't had the battery run out on me.<br />- Movie mode records images as well as sound. Also theres a speaker for you to preview the movie with sound.<br />- Theres a motorized metal lens cover that protects your lens. Its really fun to watch the lens cover go down to reveal the lens when you turn the camera on and also when it goes back up when you turn it off. (You'll see what I'm talking about after you get the camera)<br />- Image quality in my opinion is more than enough for my needs. I mainly use the pictures for internet use and occasionally print out the pictures on photo paper.  2.11 mega pixels is more than enough if those are your intentions also.<br />- The camera powers up and is ready to take a picture almost immediately after you turn it on.  This is a plus for a camera you're always carrying around.<br />- Theres not a big lag between taking shots, compared to the Canon s200.<br />I'm sure theres plenty more Pro's but I'm still learning about the camera.  The camera always turns curious heads every time I take it out. So besides the cons I mentioned above, which really arent too big of a deal, this is the perfect camera for me.","I just got my minolta dimage x and from the moment I opened the box, I realized it was a great purchase I made.  The style and the look are terrific; extremely light and slim.  Up go know, very happy to have one.<br />Thanks....","I got the Dimage for xmas this year. It is my first digital camera and I love it! It couldnt be easier to use. The LCD display is really crisp and clear and the camera takes the most beautiful pictures. I am no photographer, but even my photos come out looking great. I was thoroughly impressed. I admit though, I don't use the software they provide. I run it on Windows XP and it is very simple to print and save pictures. The camera itself plugs into the PC and acts as an external drive... you just drag and drop. It couldn't be easier.","The bad: Your setting of your camara will lose after you turned it off or changed battery. The manual itself doesn't tell you all the stuff that you need to know.<br />The good:<br />-(which is also the bad)<br /> The lightweight made it easy carry but also easy to make a<br /> hand-shake picture with just a little movement.<br />-fast charge battery (like an hour for full charge)<br />Well overall it's cool design doesn't make me stop using it","I Keep it with me wherever I go - it's so compact!  I'm really pleased with the start up and shutter response time.  If I have it in my shirt pocket I can actually pull it out and do one hand grab shots (takes about 4 seconds total to start it and get the shot).<br />I'm also happy with the rechargeable battery life. The package I bought came with two batteries and charger - very nice to have an extra battery handy (they're so small)!<br />People are always amazed by it's size when I pull it out of my pocket to take a picture! The 3x zoom really helps in composing the picture.<br />I put a 128 MB Secure Digital Card in it and at normal quality - (about 500k jpeg file size) I've got about 250 picture capacity!! If I don't do any movie shots, which are also very good - my whole vacation can be on one card before I have to download!<br /><br />5 x 7 prints are photo quality - I was impressed. I haven't tried it but the best quality mode stores as a TIFF file (about 8MB in size!).<br />Two things to I've learned:<br />1 - Due to it's small size it's easy to get your fingers in front of the lens or flash - but you'll quickly learn how best to hold it.<br />2 - The flash is located to the side of the lens so I turn the camera to put the flash above the lens to avoid background edge shadows when the subject is several feet in front of a wall or backdrop.<br /><br />I just noticed they've come out with a 3 Megapixel version  in the same package if you feel you must have more resolution.","This camera is IT.  I tell you I hunt and fish alot.  This little camera goes with me all the time.  Fits in a pocket and you dont even know it is there!!  I always have to snap a few picks for the boys back home.  The wife loves this litte thing also.  The quitaly of the pic are great.  I love it.  I say if you are looking for a easy to use just pick up and shoot camera GET THIS ONE..  I have own mine for a year and noting bad to say about it.","I love this camera. I also bought a 128Mb Memory card. And the first weekend I took 197 photos. Anyway you'll need to buy a extra battery I took 80 photos at 1600 in fine mode at nigth with the lcd turned on before the battery run out! Be carefull or you'll will become potho maniac with this camera!","THE GOOD:<br />The highlight of this camera is of course the size. It is super small, super easy to carry around in a shirt pocket, or for a lady to put in a small purse for a night out on the town. It is a DEFINITE attention getter. I went out to dinner with my girl, and about 20 people asked about it (too bad I was with my girl cause 19/20 were chicks ha ha)...<br />I am far from being a professional photographer, but I am very impressed with the quality of the pictures, and the ability to take them in 3 different sizes (1600x1200, 1280x960, 640x480) and 4 different quality modes (super fine, fine, standard, economy)...<br />Another pro is the ability to upload the pictures from the camera to u'r computer. You can use the USB cable that comes with it, power it on once its connected to your PC, and automatically window will pop up asking you to tranfer the files from cam to PC (I use win XP)...<br />THE BAD:<br />The software that came with this camera was a waste of programmer's hours to develop. Better off using windows PAINT, and if your lucky and have XP, better to create a Pictures folder and maintain the photo's there. Not much ability with the software that came with it. Its not pretty to use, and doesn't give you much editing ability. If you already have Photoshop or MS Draw, or any decent photo editing software, then you are good to go.<br />It was also hard to take pictures using the LCD in the dark. For obvious reasons - the screen was pitch black. You would need to take the picture first, and then preview it in the LCD to see if you got the person or have to retake it. But you can shut off the LCD feature and use the viewfinder to take u'r nite shots.<br />THE UGLY:<br />The ugly is the price. I paid around [$$$] for the camera in April 2002, then bought a matching clip on carrying case for another [$$$], then a 2nd battery for it for another [$$$] (which I lost and had to buy yet ANOTHER battery), plus I bought a 128MB SD memory card for [$$$] cause 8MB wasn't cutting it (now I can put almost 2000 pictures on the card in standard mode)...so bottom line, the camera with a few accessories ended up being around $500. But that is still not too bad for this camera, and the price has DEFINITELY dropped since April, you can probably get it for around [$$$] if you look hard enough.<br />The JUDGEMENT:<br />This camera overall ROCKS! for being someone's first digital camera. The price has gone down, it is VERY much a fasionable item for guys and girls, GUARANTEED to be approached by someone to ask about it or hear side comments like \"wow that is a awesome camera\"...<br />The quality is great for being 2.11MB, which is plenty for a first timer. It is VERY easy to use...high BUY recommendation!","Although this is my second digital camera, I am not a camera person, I don't like to get bogged down in the details, but I do enjoy sharing pictures with my friends on-line.  Holy moly does the Dimage X make it easy.  Very intuitive, the manual has found its final resting place in a drawer after a quick initial scan.  The camera, in the optional case, slips on to my belt and is barely noticeable.  Being a little concerned about the special purpose battery used in the Dimage X, I purchased a second so as to always have a fresh one available.  The only negative so far is that I have had to learn to keep my fat fingers out from in front of the lens which is in the upper left corner of the camera.  Picture quality is good for my purposes, transfer of pictures to my computer is a breeze.  Very happy with the camera.","I've owned the Minolta Dimage X for about 6 months now, and I have been very happy with it thus far.  I will admit I'm not a photography expert, and this is my first digital camera.  I'm not the greatest judge regarding photo quality, but I'm definitely happy with it.  This camera is definitely an attention-getter, and people will always be asking you to check it out.  I love that it fits in the pocket of my dress shirt as well.<br />The menus on the screen are very easy to use, and there are three size settings and four quality settings.  You can also turn off the screen (to save battery life) and use the viewfinder instead.  This is handy if you don't have much battery life left.  I also like that it tells you how many photos are remaining on the memory card.<br />There is one negative- the software that comes with the camera is absolutely terrible. It has an ugly lay-out and some of the functions don't even work.  If you are doing constant uploading, you may want to use external software.  But this is a great and stylish camera for the casual user.","GOOD THINGS:<br />You don't appreciate how small this thing is until you sit it next to any other real digital camera on the market. I have two Olympus models, a C-2040Z and a Brio D-150. I thought the D-150 was small, but the Dimage X makes it seem huge in comparison. It even makes the Canon ELPHs seem porky.<br />This camera is easy to use with simple menus and intuitive controls. I had it all figured it out in just a few minutes without looking at the manual. If you have Windows 2000, ME or XP, you just plug it into your USB port and it pops up on \"My Computer\"--no software drivers required.<br />It's very quick to turn on (no lens to extend) and is reasonably quick at taking pictures depending on the image size/quality and if you're using the flash. The flash can take about 6 seconds to recycle but that's typical. It has a \"multiple shot\" mode as well.<br />Commonly used controls like the flash mode, display on/off and exposure correction are accessible directly without using the menus. There are only 4 menus and they're really easy to navigate. You can choose from 3 image sizes and 4 quality levels including an uncompressed TIFF mode.<br />Battery life seems AMAZINGLY good given that the battery is literally the size of some postage stamps! I ran around for over an hour with the display on taking tons of pics, downloading them, messing with the menus, etc. before it gave me a low battery warning. The reviews say you can leave it on all day with the display off and take several hundred pictures all on one charge.<br />The case is nearly all stainless steel. It should stand up to a fair amount of use/abuse. The lens is covered by a sliding motorized door when it's off. There should be less to break/go wrong compared to cameras that have to extend the lens every time you turn them on.<br />BAD THINGS:<br />My biggest gripe is the picture quality. Other [more expensive] two megapixel cameras are significantly better. My Olympus C-2040Z takes sharper pictures with fewer artifacts under any conditions and completely blows the Minolta away in low light. With a much bigger (conventional) lens, however, that's to be expected.<br />The Dimage X images are a bit \"soft\"--especially in the corners and edges. You don't really notice it on most casual shots, but if there's fine detail in the corners and along the edges, it's a bit fuzzy.<br />Perhaps more annoying, there are \"chromatic artifacts\" visible in many pictures. These seem to be worse at the wide angle end of the zoom range. You get either a red, yellow or blue band next to sharp high contrast lines. This is likely due to the prism used to \"fold\" the lens and from keeping the weird lens design so small. It's part of the price you have to pay (at least right now) for a camera this compact. There are reviews on the net that have samples pictures that show this flaw quite clearly. ...<br />The lens has a smaller maximum aperture than many comparable lenses on bigger cameras so it forces the Dimage X to use slower shutter speeds to make up for it. This means camera shake is more of a problem in lower light. It also means it can't focus as well in low light and the LCD viewfinder doesn't work as well either.<br />The charger is a standalone unit and while fairly small, requires a plug in cord. It's just one more thing to travel with. You have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it.<br />There's no manual focus mode (there is a focus lock where you can focus on something else, hold the shutter button part way down, and then take the picture). In really low light, like most digital cams, it can't focus at all--at least it defaults to 6 feet.<br />The LCD display washes out more than some do in bright outdoor light. At least they give you a shortcut to the menu to adjust the brightness. You also have to push a button twice every time you turn on the camera if you want to turn the display off to greatly extend the battery life.<br />The flash is kind of weak (or the small lens is hurting it) as the flash is only good to about 8 - 10 feet or so and even then the edges are darker at the wide angle zoom setting.<br />There's no manual white balance, just presets. So if you're in tricky lighting, you're stuck. The auto setting also tends to be on the warm side under most conditions. This isn't a huge deal as you can always tweak the color later on your PC.<br />OTHER STUFF:<br />Extra batteries are still hard to find, ... . You'll want one. ...you might want to buy a cheap card reader instead [of an AC adapter]. MMC/SD cards are more expensive than SmartMedia and CF, but they make sense for this camera because they're much smaller. I doubt Minolta could have found room for the older flash cards. Besides, MMC/SD will keep dropping in price I'm sure--they're the newest technology right now. There is a note in the manual that MMC cards take longer to store pictures than SD (which is due to the card design).<br />CONCLUSION:<br />It's not perfect, but it's currently in a class by itself. The Canon ELPHs take slightly better pictures but are significantly bigger. If this is going to be your ONLY (or your best) digital camera, you hopefully put a much higher priority on size/portability rather than image quality and elaborate features. If it's going to be a second camera for more casual use, it's an excellent choice. I take this camera places I'd never take my C-2040 or even the D-150 Brio. What good is a nice camera if it always stays home?<br />I'm sure other manufactures will follow with their own ultra compact digital models. Minolta will improve on this one as well. But as a first effort, it's pretty amazing.<br />If image quality is a big priority, I'd look at the cheaper Olympus C-2040Z or Canon A20. If you want something that's small with slightly better quality than the Dimage X, consider a Canon ELPH. If small/light/easy are big priorities, the Dimage X may be well worth buying.","Yes, it's cute.  Yes, you can have it with you everywhere.  But bottom line, will you wish you'd taken a different camera with you when you look at the pictures later?<br />I haven't purchased this camera; I considered it strongly until I saw sample images on several camera review sites.  On every single one, it goes completely soft in the corners of every shot.  It's a limitation of the lens, and once you see it you always see it.  I found myself vowing to deal with the greater bulk of my Canon S30 and coming home with pictures worth saving.<br />And for those who say it's a great \"party camera\" -- look, either a picture's worth taking or it isn't...and if it's worth taking, don't take a blurry one!","That problem goes away with this little camera because you'll take it everywhere. It is really handy!! The pictures are decent and with photoshop you'll have print quality pictures.","I had the Nikon,<br />I have the DIMAGE 7 (for Studio shot 5.1mb)<br />I got the DimageX to carry every day with me!<br />I got the 128mb card 2 batteries and I went  to Europe<br />France Italia without my computer. Got 600 photos!<br />The Best of the best<br />However It did stop working...<br />I sent it back and few days later I got it back or a new ONE!?!<br />The quality is superbe!  Using image -adjust-autolevel in Photoshop and you cannot see the difference!!!<br />--For the one not happy with the color JUST sent it back to get it fixed!---<br />Did I tell you that 4 of my friends are today the owner of one as well?<br />Love it","Flash could be brighter (You have to be ~5-6 feet away from subjects in very dark spaces..) but otherwise an awesome overall camera.<br />-mark","Before I begin, I'm no expert, I'm the point and shoot disposable camera type who bought a digital so I wouldn't have to pay $10-$15 10 times a year for a throw-away anymore.  So I bought the Dimage X becuase it looked cool and was actually smaller than a disposable.  The camera will wow everyone when you whip it out to take a picture.  There's no doubt that it looks great, feels great in your pocket and it's a take it anywhere camera.<br />Here are my thoughts.<br />Pros<br />-Small<br />-Looks cool<br />-Great Movie mode(35 secs with sound)<br />-Good zoom<br />-Decent price for the size<br />-Battery is pretty good, I took 100 pictures at Fine Quality before it died<br />Cons<br />-PICTURE QUALITY is worse than a k-mart no name brand throw away.  Almost every picture I took indoors has a yellow tint.  People will talk auto white balance with you, listen, they are YELLOW.  The pictures are not sharp, as you would expect from a digital camera.<br />-The viewfinder is below par.  You look through the viewfinder, think it's centered and after you take the picture it's completely off.  I'm 24, my hands don't shake when I take a picture, something is wrong with the viewfinder quality.<br />-The picture program that comes with it is virtually useless.<br />My advice, I'm I'm being completely serious- Don't get fooled by the great looks.  The bottom line is how the picture looks.  Maybe the newer version will be better (Dimage Xi)... but my friend has the Fuji 2600 which sells for a lot cheaper, might be bigger, but the picture quality is crisp and digital worthy.","I bought this camera after having a sony digital mavica for some years. The dimage is amazingly convenient becasue it is so small, you can carry it anywhere so you can get better photos because you can catch odd moments where you wouldn't expect to have a camera. The mavica was a pain it was too bulky and heavy so I never wanted to carry it and downloading from floppy disks was slow.<br />my criticisms of the dimage x are these:<br />a. you can't put a date onto the photo<br />b. the photo numbers restart from 1 each time so that you can't just copy all photos into the same folder without clashes - you have to rename them (the mavica keeps on adding one to the photo name: mvc-771, mvc-772 etc.).<br />c. the photos tend to be dark.  the automatic ISO handling doesn't function well so that I tend to have it permanently on cloudy. the mavica deals with this far better.<br />d. the dimage has difficulty with variations in contrast.<br />e. you can't permanently turn the flash off.  every time you turn it on you have to turn off the flash because it tends to flash most of the time<br />f. the drivers are not available over the internet.  I got stuck on holiday because I forgot to bring the drivers with me and couldn't download the photos.<br />g. on some flash photos at night I got blotches on the picture something to do with the lens.<br />h. I am unsure about how it handles bright colors - may have difficulty with this<br />in favor:<br />a. size size size though its also easier to lose...<br />b. battery life is long and charge time is fast<br />c. takes good photos in low light<br />d. easy to use menu<br />e. screen tells you how many photos left, how many you've taken<br />f. fast download though you need a usb connection<br />g. tough case<br />h. I enjoy using it and have got some good photos. sometimes need to do enhancements to bring it up to scratch","I am new to the Digital camera thing, so I wanted something convenient, and easy to use. I was looking at this camera and the Elph. This won, because it's smaller, has a movie function, and a 3X optical zoom. The Elph 200 has no movie function, and has a 2X optical zoom. Optical is better then Digital zoom (less grain).<br />  This camera is pretty much plug and play. I had to read a few of the instructions to understand some of the things, but it seems really straight forward. Do not use the top setting. It is a waste of space. It is the same data as the Fine setting, just Uncompressed. The pictures 4X6 come out looking exactly the same. But you can fit only 28 pictures on a 128 card, instead of 130 pictures at the Fine setting.<br /><br />  As soon as you buy this Camera, go on line and do a search for a 256MB Secure Digital (SD) Card. It costs about [price]. It's the best card out there for the money, and you will not find the 256MB in stores. You can find a 512 card on line, but it is<br />[price]. That's just as expensive as the camera! The camera comes with an 8MB card. You can take 3 pictures with this thing, then it's full, get a bigger card. You WILL want it.<br />  The ONE flaw with this camera, and this REALLY bothers me, is the stupid Battery light. Whoever designed this thing, should be forced to use a bad universal remote, for the rest of their life! Most battery levels, have a picture of a battery, that is broken into sections, and each section disappears as the battery runs out of life. Easy to understand, right? This camera has a battery symbol, that is white when full, then light gray when half full, then Red when you have 5 minutes left. I challenge anyone to tell the difference between White, and light gray on a battery symbol that small.<br /><br />  Buy an extra battery. You WILL need it. And buy the nice pouch, it has a pocket for the extra battery in it. I love this camera. I hate the battery symbol.<br />  Good thing is.... The battery can charge fully in about 45 minutes. That's fast.<br />The camera comes with a Battery Charger, USB cable, Software for viewing the pictures on your computer, a Lithium battery, and an 8MB card.<br /><br />  You need to buy a case,  another battery (If you use it all day), and a  much larger Memory Card (nothing less then 128MB). They sell an AC adapter, but it's really not needed. It just seems like more wires to worry about.<br /><br />  The camera is not really point-and-shoot. It focuses first, then shoots.<br />Hope this helps.","supposedly I can get 1.5 days of continuous usage if I just use the viewfinder instead of the LCD screen.  Fast 2 second startup time means that I hardly lose a good moment.  I also use an epson 3100z which takes up to 7 seconds before it can take a picture.  I don't even want to talk about my Kodak DC280 that ... out after 1.5 years.  The color on the Kodak was by far the most accurate and shapest I've seen though.<br />It is fast... Fastest RISC processor avail. to date: 9-17-02<br />Uses a sony CCD so the quality of the pictures is pretty good.  I recommend getting another battery.  Pretty cheap $ since it lasts 2.5-3hrs on LCD continuous use and only takes 1 hour to charge.  Up the SD/MMC card though.  It worked good with 128MB.  Not so great zoom but adequete.  I also suggest getting a $ case to protect the LCD screen, and buttons.  It is perfect for a woman (for whom I bought it for) but I prefer the SLR types that I can attach lenses and external flases on my Epson 3100z.<br />In short it is always available because it is fast, small, and quality is pretty good.  Kind of steep price compared to the comprable Nikkon, Kodak, Olympus, etc... but Minolta did a fine job here.  Not everybody has this camera and not many review it but the reviews have been great and I must agree (if you have the extra money).","This is my 3rd digital camera. I am very impressed with the ease of use, simple menus to navigate,the compact size and the extrordinary quality of images. With a 64meg card I can get about 200 standard (1280x860) images  with a great resolution for printing.<br />Basically with two 64 meg or larger cards and two or three batteries I can do a six week travel without having too carry a Computer, harddrives and so on!","Yeah, the image quality is average, but for snapshots and fun movies, it's great. It does look very cool, and it is the smallest digital camera out there that takes movies with sound. This makes it a great camera to bring along to the baseball game, to the beach, an amusement park, etc. For all those videocamera moments.","I love that camera. Very small. lightweight, aluminum case, Li-on 1 Amp battery and no lenses outside. I can bring it with me every day - it fits in my pocket or on the belt and I event don't fell it at all. Very good quality of pictures & great colors. Good display. But you can't imprint date & time on your pictures. I think - it's the best \"point & shoot\" camera. I used to have Ricoh DC5300 & Canon S110. And I like my Minolta.","When I was going to buy my Dimage X in the US I was afraid because in the minolta web page they said you could not use the camera abroad. This is absolute nonsense. The only country where I have used my Dimage X (US bought - half the price than in Europe), is Spain, and it works fine. The only \"problem\" you need to solve is finding a plug adaptor for the charger, since it will not fit in most of the spanish plugs. And this will happen in any other european country (UK, Ireland...) No problem at all with the voltage.<br />Regarding the camera I am really satisfied with it. It is not only slim, quick and reliable, but ultra-cool and trendy (and takes good pictures too :-). You just need an extra battery, and at least a 64 MB SD Card. A case is also an option if you dont want to carry it in your pocket. It is definetely a GO!","I've had my camera for almost a year and I like it better every day. I rate the photo quality as VERY good. In fact, better than my (heavy bulky) Cannon SLR. It is so easy to use and fits perfectly in my leather business card holder. I keep it with me all the time and never miss a photo op. My suggestion: GET THIS CAMERA and get a spare battery and high capacity memory card. You won't be disappointed. And shop around - I got mine for about $100 less than offered by most online merchants and it was new, never out of the box perfect.","I just got this little camera.  I opened it up, read a quick review of how to navigate the menus and started taking pics.  So far this camera has not taken a bad picture in many different situations.  Just set it on automatic and let it do its thing.  I took pictures in the dark, in the refrigerator, lamps on in the room, outside in daylight, while driving down the street, all perfect pics.  It just always takes perfect picture.  I love it.  Its small and light weight.  Very nice camera. You just dump the pics via windows explorer via another drive letter it creates when you plug the camera in.  You also delete pictures in the camera that way if you desire.  Dumps VERY fast, also.  I recommend it highly.  You won't be disappointed.","This is my first digital camera and I'm extremely happy with the picture quality and features (like the mini movies).  Everyone gasps at the size of the camera and is further surprised at the 3x zoom.  Battery life is more than adequate for parties or golf outings.  I've dropped the camera once, no problems.  Another time it fell into a pond, yet still works perfectly fine.","Size: great. Features: good. Image quality: good.<br />I needed a camera that was small enough for me to take anywhere in my pocket. This one is great for that purpose. Pictures quality is more than adequate, and with a purchase of a 64MB memory card, I can take over 120 pictures at the highest resolution 1600X1200. Menu is intuitive, transferring images can be done with ease, even for the not-so-tech-savvy. The zoom is pretty good too. Battery is Li-Ion, lasts for pretty long time. LCD is bright and clear, if a bit small, but what do you expect from a camera that was the smallest 2MP camera available when it was released? Some may complain about how much control they have over the how the photo is taken (ie, light, focus, etc.)<br />In short, great camera for take anywhere, do-almost-everything photography. Perfect for family outings and friendly gatherings.<br />For those of you want higher resolution but the same portability, the new Dimage Xi has 3MPixels!","I got and enjoys it.  Here's my assessment of the Dimage X.<br />First, ...<br />The CONS:<br />- There seems to be lacking a manual focus to \"infinity\" for taking pictures out of a window (not that it happens alot, but...).  Maybe there is, but I can't find it.<br />- I would like a little more \"sharpness.\" (All current digital cameras suffers from a lack of sharpness, even the 3 MP cameras...it could be JPG-related because I haven't really seen any digital camera that gives sharp pics without software processing.)<br />- Because it's so small it's easy to move while pressing the button (if you're loaded with caffeine!) thereby further decreasing the sharpness.<br />- The software is \"powerful\" but it requires time to learn how to use it properly.<br />- Battery is propriety and I'm not sure how long it REALLY lasts and it does seem to use alot of power (LCD display, navigating the menu, downloading pics, playing with the 3x zoom lens).  Eventually, you'll want to buy another battery/charger as backup.  You should also get a memory card reader when it's offered free (with rebate) and save on the power wasted on downloading pics to PC.  (Heck! get 2--keep one in the office.  Your PDA could use it also.)<br />THE PROS:<br />- It's small and flat (fits in shirt pocket) and handy to carry around wherever.  More photo-ops.<br />- It's sturdy and looks cool.<br />- It has a \"superfine\" TIF mode (no loss...supposedly).<br />- 3x optical zoom is cool.<br />- The automatic lens protector looks and sounds cool when it opens/closes--like a James Bond gadget.<br />- Battery charges in 80 minutes.<br />VERDICT:<br />Kind of pricey compared with the recent price drops in the 3MP cameras, but chances are you won't like carrying those cameras around.  The Dimage X's a decent \"general purpose\" camera you would LIKE to carry around and which can also be used for serious picture taking (in TIF mode).  (Many of those other cameras don't have a TIF mode--just a higher JPG mode.)  It's more than just a novelty. Good enough until next spring when the NEXT GENERATION cameras (with CMOS technology) are out.","My history with Minolta goes back to Nam'68, with the SRT-101,a 35mm that was spectacular in the field under all conditions. Later the incredible XE-7, Maxxum 700 and even the Freedom(P&S).This company has always been a tech leader and now has taken it even a step further.<br />The Dimage X is an awsome little digital package that delivers far more than I had ever anticipated. This camera is fun to use!It's fast...the results are spectacular and it fits nicely into your pocket.... Plus , the amount of photo ops I've been able to capture because of size and portability, have made using it a true value-added experience.Thanks Minolta!","The camera comes with a 100-240V charger so charging the battery in other countries is perfectly fine.  I have a unit that was bought in Hong Kong and I've tried to charge it in the States, not a problem.  You do, however, need to have an 'adapter' to change the shape of the prongs of the plug in order to charge in other countries.  The small size of this camera is the best part of it.  Picture quality is ok but the LCD is a little bit dim sometimes.  Overall, this is a great camera and I loved it.  I am not a picture-taking person but I guess I will be from now on!","Minolta says you can not recharge the Dimage X battery overseas.<br />This seems ridiculous for such a fine 'travel' camera.  Has anyone tried recharging the battery outside the US and Canada?","This is my first digital camera.  Its photographic performance is amazing and very comparable to a conventional camera.  Its extraordinary size makes it so convenient to have it with you almost all the time - which means you miss fewer \"Kodak Moments\".  One always wants a longer battery life, but I do wish that it had a cradle to charge it rather than having to remove the battery each time.  Nevertheless, on balance, an outstanding piece of technology !!!!","I just bought the Dimage X 2 weeks ago and I can't put it down!  I love it!  When I set out to buy a digital camera for my trip to Europe, I wanted something very small that printed like Walgreens minus the pesky dust.  I found it.  I don't even have a photo quality printer, but it looks like I do.<br />  All my friends have seen it and they're in awe.  I'm even reluctant to let people hold it because I'm afraid they might drop it, so I make them wear the wrist strap at all times.  I teach a photography course, so I know a lot about SLR cameras and photography in general. I know a good print when I see one. And the Dimage X is anything but \"soft\" as some of the other reviewers have said.<br />  But I'm just getting in to the digital revolution.  Compared to my big, bulky SLR, the Dimage is a needle.  I'm even finding it hard to go back.  The little 35 second movie mode is an added bonus.  Plus you can record voice clips to your pictures.  It also takes either SD memory cards or MultiMedia Cards (MMC).  The SD cards are also used in other devices as well, so you can alternate back and forth. I upgraded to a 128 SD card so I have enough space. The battery has a long life. The software is easy to use and the pictures transfer quickly. The menu is easy to navigate and I've found that it takes amazing, true to life pictures without even having to alter anything on the computer.<br />  I reccommend that you buy the carrying case because you will be very protective of the little X.  I've had no trouble whatsoever with this camera.  It's definitely the life of the party!  Get one today.  You won't be disappointed!","After researching digital cameras for a couple weeks, I decided on the Dimage X.  At first look, I wondered if i was sent a camera or a deck of cards....it's that small.  The battery charges up in 1.5 hours and by then you've read the book and are ready to put it to use.  It has great features and is simple to use...not to mention you can put it in your pocket and not feel like you're carrying Hugh Heffners wallet!<br />  It has all the modes of other cameras, a good battery life, and once again, the size is super small.  If you have big hands, you may have problems, but you'll get used to holding it.  Everything comes in the box, a charger and all the cables needed.  Get a bigger Memory Card, even though the 8MB card holds 67 pictures in 640x480/standard mode (only 1 in 1600x1200/super fine mode).<br />  This is a perfect camera for trips, family photos and general use.  Good pictures and not hard to use...","I am a very casual digital camera user. I am using the dimage x just for photos on vacation, etc. I bought it a few weeks ago, and I think it is an excellent camera. It really does fit in a shirt pocket, and I got the optional belt case for it as well. The pictures are excellent quality (at least compared to my old APS elph). 2 megapixel is fine for good 4x6 photos. Obviously, if you are a photo professional, you will be looking for a bigger camera with more features. But, if you are a regular old guy looking for a very cool and pocketable digital camera that takes great casual pictures, then this is the camera for you (it does get oohs and ahs)","This is such a nice little camera and I really like it but there's one bug that may be the reason I return it. It depends if I can learn to live with it or not.<br />*You cannot set the flash to be off by default.*<br />Once you turn the camera off, it defaults back to 'auto flash' mode. Personally I only ever use the flash every once in a while and this is so annoying. I Prefer somewhat dark photos over those harsh flash lit ones every time. So the \"ultra fast start up\" that Minolta touts becomes moot if you have to click 3 or more times just to get the flash not to go off.<br />Also, the menu interface, like all digital cameras for some reason, is badly designed, requiring two hands to operate. Often it is not clear what you have selected because, for example, if you have only two choices and your selection only changes colour it is unclear which colour represents 'selected' Does the grey mean it's selected or does the pink?<br />Having said that, it's very very small and takes good photos.","One other comment - the USB drivers failed to load with my Windows 2000 Professional system.  Other reviewers complained about the same problem with Windows 98.  But then I ran the hardware wizard and told it to use the generic Microsoft Mass Storage Device driver instead of the one Minolta supplied on a CD - and it worked perfectly.","Why only \"almost\" perfect?  Because the auto-exposure system<br />always selects the fastest possible shutter speed.  So,<br />pictures I just took on a brilliantly sunny day used a<br />shutter speed of 1/685 and an f-stop of only 3.5 -- so almost<br />no depth of field.  This was very noticable in close-ups.<br />The camera needs a \"creative control\" mode that lets the<br />user select max-shutter-speed, max-depth-of-field, or a normal<br />balance.  But I still love the camera - and if a new model<br />comes out with such a feature I'll be first in line again.","It's a lot smaller and ligher than I imagined.  Pictures looks great, the short film mode is an added bones, and the battery seems to last long enough.  The only negative I've seen so far is that many pictures seem to have a \"red eye\" effect.  ...[It] is a bargain for such a collection of absolute forefront technology.","Let me start by saying I use to teach photography at college and an a critic as far as picture quality goes.  A college of mind bought this camera and I was so impressed with the size and features I figured what the heck I'll give it a shot because my Cannon G1 is just to big to carry with me all the time.<br />One of the most important feature to me was size, I wanted something I could carry around.  This covered it, it is small, wow is it small and light.  It's slender body fits into my pocket and I forget it is there.  As a result I shoot more pics.  The other nice feature is the quick worm up time of about a sec.  Cameras I have had in the past I missed shots because they were booting up.  This camera has a exceptional exposure control in low light, it is hard to take a bad picture.<br />Now for the down side.  The picture quality is OK.  I find it a bit smooth and not crisp enough for my taste, but nothing photoshop can't fix.  I miss a volume control on the shutter it is either on or off and there are no shortcuts to the menu items to quickly toggle features or delete frames.  The view window on the back is fixed and a bit small and dark sometimes, mostly in low light.  Also when shooting movies the mic is on the top of the camera rather than the front so if you are in a busy room it pics up everything else as loud as the people you trying to shoot.<br />Over all for the size it is awesome.  I would call it a excellent party, snapshot type camera.  If I lost it I would go out and buy another one without hesitastion.","Let me start by saying I use to teach photography at college and an a critic as far as picture quality goes.

They're bulky, so I'm disinclined to take them with me to events, or just to the corner diner. Therefore, whether film or digital, the great Kodak moments pass by without a record of them. In my view, the things that kept cameras bulky were the film roll and the zoom lens. Digital photography was supposed to take care of the bulk of film, but cameras were still an inch or two thick, essentially, small bricks. This camera is the first device that meets all my needs. It's small, decent quality, and has a zoom lens -- and it fits in my shirt pocket and my front jeans pocket -- that means that in the last two weeks, I have taken more pictures than I have in the past year owning an Olympus C-2020 Zoom digital camera. Trust me, if you can find it, you will be amazed at how much you enjoy owning this camera!","Having had many other small cameras in the past -- from tiny Minoxes to the latest Kyocera S3 -- I was really looking forward to having a small digital camera I could keep with me at all times.<br />The Dimage X is a stunning little package; anyone who sees it wants to pick it up, hold it, and play with it.  The design and finish are first-rate. The size, though -- that's what this camera is all about.  It's the first digicam to use an internal zoom mechanism, which allows the X to be ridiculously slim.  Other cameras might have a slightly smaller \"footprint\" but the X wins where it counts -- it is so slim you forget it's in your pocket.  As a result it is very easy to keep with you at all times.<br />The Dimage X works very well in daily use.  The most important convenience is its' speed.  Many other cameras simply take too long to turn on, or have very long wait times as they record an image.  The little Minolta is among the swiftest of cameras in these regards.  It also allows you to fire off several frames in rapid succession; it appears to allow around five pictures, then pauses to record them to memory.  This is very handy when your trying to capture something elusive -- children, for example.<br />The X's lithium-ion batteries give what I consider very long run-times before expiring.  In comparison to another small digicam, the Kyocera S3, the Dimage X offers approximately double the battery life.  It gives ridiculously long run times with the LCD display switched off; the camera's internal electronics seem very well designed and appear to operate very efficiently.  The camera never feels hot to the touch (or even warm, for that matter); I noticed this was a problem with the Kyocera, which may account for it's short run-times.<br />The only thing I dislike about the Dimage X is its' image quality.  To keep the zoom mechanism inside the camera required the use of a prism.  This limits the camera from being as sharp, ultimately, as a conventional camera, and also leads to slightly less contrast and color saturation in the images.<br />To qualify this review I should admit to being a perfectionist who is reluctant to EVER compromise on image quality.  In this case the size and packaging of this camera have won me over.  With further refinement the Minolta Dimage X could approach perfection; as it stands it's one great little camera that will accompany you everywhere.","Major Features:<br />* Incredibly compact and lightweight camera.<br />* Dimensions: 3.3\" (W) x 2.8\" (H) x 0.8\" (D)<br />* Weight: 4.8 ounces<br />* Fits easily into your pocket.<br />* Unique 3x \"folded\" F/2.8 optical zoom lens<br />* 2-megapixel imager for images up to 1600 x 1200 pixels<br />* Still images stored in JPEG compressed or uncompressed TIFF format<br />* Motion video 320 x 240 with audio at 15fps up to 35 seconds<br />* 15-second audio notes can be attached to images<br />* 1.5-inch TFT color LCD monitor<br />* Minolta's CxProcess image processing provides clear and natural images<br />* 12-bit A/D conversion provides a finer tonal gradation<br />* White balance options: automatic, daylight, tungsten, cloudy and fluorescent<br />* Built in flash with Auto, Red-eye reduction, Night portrait and Fill modes<br />* Audio/Video output, NTSC or PAL selectable<br />* Removable flash memory cards (SD or MMC type)<br />* Epson PRINT Image Matching compliant<br />* Lithium rechargeable battery (~2hr. life) and charger included","I have been looking for a digital camera for a month or so now. When I saw the first comments on the DIMAGE X I really wanted this camera badly. Then I found a couple of extensive reviews that rate the camera only average. A special concern with these reviewers was the \"poor picture quality\", especially the \"softness\". I became quite skeptical and started to lean more towards buying the Canon S 110. Then I learned that the Canon (although receiving recommended and highly recommended ratings) produces pictures that suffer from very noticeable \"chromatic aberrations\". I looked at sample images and decided that this was a much worse flaw than the allegedly \"soft\" images of the X. So when the X became available I bought it from a store with a generous return policy and decided to test it on my own and, if unsatisfactorily, return it. Well, it is a keeper. Here are my reasons:<br />First and foremost: Design. Oh my God, especially in Manhattan it is not easy to make people turn their heads, but when you elegantly pull the X out of your pocket, they will. Guaranteed. The aluminum and steel case is very sturdy. Only the little lens protector that moves up so boldly to protect the lens when you turn the camera off is a little flimsy. Also you have to get used to holding the camera a little differently with your left hand than you would naturally, or you will get in contact with the lens and block the picture.<br />Secondly, operation. Everything about this little thing is well thought out. Read the manual and you are in control in an hour or so. I only have some minor concerns about the ease of use. The position of the important enter button requires you to take your fingers of the scroll buttons or use both hands, which is rather awkward and makes navigating the menus a bit more cumbersome than necessary.<br />Thirdly, picture quality. Sorry professional reviewer guys. You really got this one wrong. Again, dear fellow non professional picture takers, read the manual and experiment a little bit. After maybe an hour of trying or so I was able to make perfectly sharp, nice pictures. If you use the zoom to reduce or enhance perspective and play a little with the exposure times, you can even get some dramatic photographic effects. So for me it is not only a little snap-shooter, but a camera that truly satisfies not only my photographic needs, but also the most hefty cravings for attention...at least for the next few months, until everybody will have one of those little sweet X fellows. Get it. It's good. ...","The new DiMage X is just an incredible camera!  First of all it's small, perhaps the smallest 2-megapixel digicam on the American market today.  I still have my Canon S100 but this one is not only thinner but also lighter -- and the battery life is longer, too!<br />The second most amazing thing is even though the camera lens does not move, it *is* capable of 3X true *optical* zoom!!  This is accomplished through an internal movable prism.  Simply an ingenious piece of work!  This means two things: fast zoom, and less distortion.<br />The camera is quite fast in saving images (max resolution is 1600x1200, just like the Canon S100) to the SD card.  It takes about 1-1.5 seconds between pictures when flash is used and around 1 sec when flash is off.<br />Picture quality is *excellent*!  One gripe I have about the S100 is the image quality is so so, especially in low-light conditions.  The DiMage X easily ranks among the high-quality digital pictures.  Images are sharp and color-rich.  You can also make exposure compensation if you feel the picture is slightly over or under exposed.<br />This is one awesome camera!  Its unique shape, extraordinary compactness and awesome picture quality make it simply the best consumer digital camera.","If you're looking for the smallest digital camera that<br />you can always bring around with you, this is it!<br />It's even more compact than the Canon S110 and fits well<br />in your shirt pocket. 3x optical zoom is excellent,<br />but images are a bit soft, and seem like they are only<br />of 1.5MP quality. Internal zoom lens structure allows<br />for fast start-up time and battery life is comparable to<br />that of the Canon S110 (about 150-180 pictures).<br />It's not so easy to hold this camera steady as the<br />shape does not allow for a natural grip of the hand,<br />and the buttons are a bit small. But if size is your<br />most important criterion then this digital camera<br />beats them all!"]},{"name":"Sony Mavica FD-100","amazon_reviews":["Great","Very satisfied.","Like the camera for the purpose of taking pictures of y wife's egg crafts.

If you pay less, you are probably missing some fundamental feature (a zoom is often the first thing to go) and if you pay more, you are getting more than you probably wanted (some special lens made from a glass that NASA uses to make the microwaves on the shuttle or something like that). With the Mavica FD series, the extra 100 or 200 dollars is going to its method of storing pictures, on simple, inexpensive floppy disks.<br />If that still does not seem to justify the price, consider this: a floppy disk drive runs anywhere from 40 to 60 dollars, now take that drive and stick it on the back of a digital camera (thus making it self-powered).<br />And then there is the media itself: Smartmedia and CompactFlash cards are down in price (averaging less than a dollar per megabyte) and are available in sizes in the giga-range. That all seems fine and dandy, until you consider the phrase \"don't put all your eggs in one basket.\" The cards are like any other data storage media, and thus prone to corruption and electromagnetic interference. So, because of a simple error in the camera (it is a computer like any other, and thus prone to all the same weaknesses), a whole 64+ megabytes of memories can be lost forever. And, to add insult to injury, that card was really expensive! Meanwhile, a box of 40+ floppy disks (at about 1.44MB per disc) costs a little less than 10 dollars.

I've always wanted one, but just really never had the money for one.  I was able to get my hands on the Sony MVC-FD100 Digital Camera a couple of weeks ago, and I can say that I am very pleased with it.<br />You don't have to be a computer wiz to know how to operate it, which is one of the best qualities.  It is VERY easy to use and I seriously think that anyone can learn to use it in a matter of minutes.  It's a little bigger than most cameras, but this is because it allows you to save pictures to a floppy disk (which means that you really never have to hook up the camera to your PC to view or share your pictures).  You can also use memory sticks as well (they're expensive, but can hold lots of memory and is more convenient than switching floppies non-stop).<br />There's a lot of neat things you can do with the camera.  You can zoom in and out with ease, change the effects to make your pictures look different, and you can make short MPEG videos (with no audio).  All of these features are very easy to use and are easy to learn.<br />A main drawback to this digital camera is the price.  It is rather costly, but I think it's worth it.  If this seems to be out of your price range then you should look at some others.  There are plenty of others that are less expensive.<br />All in all, I am very pleased with the Sony MVC-FD100 Digital Camera.  It's easy to use and is very convenient.  If you're looking for a high quality digital camera that can be operated by just about anyone, then I highly recommend that you check this one out.","Hi, This was my 3rd digital camera. Actually my very first real digital camera. I've only had those toy digital cameras and since this one let you record images to floppy disk & memory stick, I definitely wanted to get this one.<br />the picture quality is great, zoom is great, everything works better than average 1.2MP digital cameras do. yea, like other people said, sometimes zoom focuses automatically on something you don't want to be focused at but easily you can avoid this by doing zoom in or zoom out (usually zoom out). Trust me, this one works great for 1.2 MP.<br />so why I only gave 3 stars ? okay, this camera is too heavy and too big to carry around. It looks actually smaller than the pictures you see on the web but still it's too heavy and too big. Impossible to put in your pocket or your bag. You must buy an additional digital camera bag for this. Even though this one is better than my other toy digital cameras, I took my toy digital cameras more often than this one. Another problem is the lag time between each picture. You have to wait around 2 seconds (for flash) for each pictures. it's pretty slow. This one let you record Movie files too without any audio for 15 seconds. It's better than nothing but definitely not a good feature. It's just 15 seconds [poor] quality movie file.<br />My conclusion is, if you don't mind about the size & weight, I think this camera may work for you. If you want to take your new digital camera with you wherever you go, this isn't for you.","This camera is a great value with it's features. I first purchased a digital camera that required you to download the pictures from memory. I like being able to take pictures on floppy and go.

We take pictures of every car that goes through our shop from the estimate, drop off, during the work and upon completion.  Basically we are always taking picutures.  With the camera we've had for years the biggest problem was taking the pictures and then transferring them to computer.  The FD Mavica solves that problem.<br />Originally the idea was if we could save to a floppy disk then we could easily transfer them to the computer without a card reader.  Upon getting the camera the crew and I fell in love with this camera.  A day after getting the camera we had a white Ford Probe come in with front bumper damage.  Deep scratches on a white bumper.  White upon white.  In other words a major pain to get a decent shot of.  But with the MVC-FD100 we bumped it up to the maximum pixel count, changed the settings to outdoors and shot the picture.  Came out beautifully.  Great detail.<br />With the MVC-FD100 we take all the needed shots of the vehicle and save it to one disk and then place the disk in the file with the rest of the paperwork.  No need to transfer via a card reader to the hard drive and label each photo.  When additional shots are required we simple pull the disk and put it back into the camera.<br />The other functions of this camera make it perfect for anyone who takes a lot of pictures.  It's great for business and personal use.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone needing a camera.  Use standard 3.5 floppy disks or memory sticks.  Transfer between the media if necessary.  It's a camera that will prove itself for years to come.","My school has 2 of these camera's and I use them quite often for school dance pictures and field trips. This is an easy to use camera. I am going on a trip this week and i am going to be purchising this camera... It's worth it!","I don't know how good the camera is, because I have not received it, but I do know that I placed the order based on it \"usually ships in 1-2 days, and my account at this time indicates  that it is supposed to be shipped in 7 days.","This is a great camera, I give it 4 starts only beacuse [does not] include a diskette or a memory stick..<br />Overall the camera is very nice, the superfine resolution is great. But it eats floppys so get a 64 or 128 mb memory stick.<br />Also be sure to get another battery pack... No sound on the movies, but its not ment to be a camcorder. Included are lens cover, shoulder strap, video out cable, a/c adapter & charger & USB cable....","It is great for taking pictures of the kids and emailing the photos to grandparents and friends."]},{"name":"Sony Mavica FD-200","amazon_reviews":["I like  it","Haven't used it other than to test, but seems to work just fine!  Battery is bad, though.","Exactly as described, except that now Windows 7 doesn't like floppy diskettes.

I do have a Memory Stick but still use the floppy disks. I use the ECM setting to get more photos on the floppy, set the ISO at 100 and the pics come out great.  I have newer cameras but still prefer this one as most of my pics are for Email.  Also, if you use a good photo editor, that helps a lot.","Very durable camers that I use for taking pictures of inbound damaged product. Good picture, but small file sizes wihihc make it easier to email.","Battery does not hold charge on its own, but came with a power chord, so I use the camera with the power chord attached, for indoor food-styling. That done, it works beautifully.  Nothing beats the Sony Mavica for crisp detailed closeups, even with this old $9.00 camera from Amazon.","I have owned this camera since it first came out in 2001. It takes exceptional pictures for only 2.0 megapixels and the original lithium battery still holds a 114 minute charge just like it did 12 years ago. I wouldn't trade it for a 10 megapixel camera at less than half the price! It's that good. Get yourself a usb floppy drive for your computer and some cheap floppy disks and have a ball with it. Very high quality product, something you don't see much of anymore. Highly Recommended!!! Just bought another one yesterday. Thought I better grab another one before they are no longer available.","This camera may be an old model but it works very well and is easy to operate.

It also has great Macro mode. The videos aren't that great, since you can get the older, and cheaper, MVC-FD91 camera that records sound (this model does not). But at 800 dollars? That is outrageous. I'd go for a used one from a reputable seller if I wanted it. I totally recomend it, just get a cheap used one. For 800-1,000 dollars you can get a professional SLR camera. If you're looking for something old-style, with a touch of modern, get this! Fun to use!","Sure, Walmart sells this for a lot less, but this is an amazing piece of technology.  I was recently informed by a friend that I could stop buying film, and just get a digital camera.  This one came up in my searching, and I am shocked.  2 megapixels!  3x Optical Zoom!  Fits perfectly in my backpack!  It even stores images on my floppy discs!  I thought I would never need those again, I'm glad I hung on to mine.  I'm not quite sure what a USB port is, but this thing is so user friendly I am sure I will figure it out.<br /><br />The silent video clips are amazing.  Maybe some day, they will be able to add sound, but until then I am having a lot of fun sending large attachments to friends of 10 second video clips.","This is an excellent camera that is easy to use, good battery life, great pictures, and I love the memory sticks. The only issue you might have is that it's rather large.<br />Highly recommend.","I purchased this camera for use listing items for sale online and am not disappointed.<br /><br />Though it is only 2MP, the pictures are more than detailed enough for my listings. The steady shot and macro settings are excellent for product close ups. The flash is not great for taking pictures of the items, it definitely washes them out so you will need to have some lighting set up.<br /><br />The zoom on this camera is pretty poor -- if you are looking for a camera to bring with you on vacation this one might not be your best choice.<br /><br />I have been using the memory sticks as opposed to floppy disks -- both are nice options. The video shooting on the camera is fair (no sound) and suitable for the short clips I sometimes include in a listing to show an item is working.<br /><br />Overall I think the camera is a nice choice for taking photos of items for sale -- and only a mediocre choice for other, outdoor or event applications.","I have had this phone since it came out in 2001.  It takes great pictures - even still!  The only thing is there is no sound with the video/movie recordings, but the pictures are still awesome 7 years later!  People make fun of my big bulky camera but they are speechless when it comes to the camera.  I wouldnt change it for the world!","The Sony MVCFD series of cameras was our Police Department's introduction into digital cameras. They filled a specific need because they allowed photos to be taken, and the floppy disk securred as evidence, without having Officers download, transfer, or copy (Evidence) images and possibly damage/lose them.<br />Even though the Department has progressed to far more sophisticated cameras, the MVCFD 200 still has an important role in taking images of lesser evidential importance, applicant pictures, etc., where 2MP's is not a problem.  This camera is such a work horse at our Department that they get used 24/7, without fail.  An incredibly dependable camera, considering the wear and tear it recieves from a host of people. We have purchased at least four replacements over the last couple of years through sites such as Amazon, to keep this simple technology going as long as possible.","So what...this camera is a dinosaur in today's fast-paced digital camera world.  However, for the price, it's fits my needs.  Just purchased a couple of 128m memory sticks, (which I am sure will soon be obsolete, too)...no more floppy disks.","I suppose the \"little\" should be re-worded. It's not the lightest, or smallest out there, by a long shot, but I really enjoy this camera.  Sure, the floppy technology is going the way of the dodo, but it is still nice to have the convenience, to have it if you need it.<br /><br />USB is in use in almost all facets of life these days.  You would have to have one extremely old and lacking P.C. to not have the USB port available.  But, there are some out there.  There are those times when the USB port won't read, when something is on the fritz, and you need that digital picture downloaded NOW.<br /><br />I can't say I'm a professional photographer, I don't judge the quality of photos for a living, but I do enjoy taking pictures.  Between the multiple focus, lighting, and picture settings, you are allotted many options to make the next shutter sound capture a beautiful picture.<br /><br />I would have to say, professionally, you can find better.  Can find items with higher resolutions, with quicker data transfer rates, etc.  But, for me, the camera is wonderful.<br /><br />During my time in the military I was deployed overseas, and the camera was by my side.  If it can make it through 14 months in a desert, in the cargo pocket of a soldier, getting slammed around and whatnot, I'm sure it's a keeper.<br /><br />Overall, 4 stars from me.","We love the convienence of having a floppy disk to store photos on, the camer may not take the best quality photos but it is sufficent for what we need.","I use this camera for work and it works very well.  The only problem I have had with it is after a few months of taking 30 to 40 pictures a day it won't read a disk.  I comes up with a formating error.  I have had to send it out for repairs twice already.  Other then that the picture quality and options are very nice.","If all you want is a straight forward and simple Digital Camera with Beautiful colors, Great ease in operation and high resolution get this before they will be gone<br />I got mine after using my older Sony Mavica MVC-FD88 for the last 3 years.<br />my older mavica costed much more and served me right and it has a 16 x Zoom with 1.3 Mega Pixel and MPEG with sound only on Floppies...<br />but Sony improve alot with this MVCFD200<br />First, they got a Floppy Disk Drive that accept all 3.5\" disks which is great for uploading to older PC's with no USB etc.<br />and the new Memory stick with a USB to PC is unreal improvement<br />not to mention the feature of uploading and downloading between<br />all these formats!!!<br />the Memory stick that I use is 128 MB and it lets me take hundreds of high quality photos like no other Digital camera that I tried including \"other\" cameras with 4 Mega Pixel !!!<br />this is simply a great camera with some extra features like the MPEG (no sound)and 6x Zoom and Digital effects.<br />to me, these features are only extras and not importent as I have a Digital Camcorder in order to make high quality movies...<br />Sony always make the best cameras and that is a fact.","Quite heavy but a good one.  If you don't have problems carrying it with you then use it!  Make sure to buy the Memory Stick because it is much better than relying on a floppy alone.","I've used the Mavica 7 and 75 for years in my work (real estate). The features most useful were Zoom (10x optical), aperture (1.8 would do low light pictures) and the floppy disk convenience. The major draw back for me was poor printed photos. I thought the 200 was an opportunity to keep the good features and correct the poor resolution and add the alternate storage capability etc. I am not sure why but Sony reduced the zoom to 3x and changed the aperture. Unfortunately I'm returning my 200.","I received this camera for my birthday. And after much waiting for shipping, it met my built up excitement. It takes great outdoor pictures and the flash is great in close nearly pitch-dark situations. Oddly enough, regular indoors pictures don't always turn out great, but who cares, just delete them. I strongly recommend getting addition equipment, a spare battery and at least 64Mb or Memory Stick. I've got a 128 which holds nearly 200 pictures at 2MP. The spare battery is nice, in that the one that comes with the camera has about 90 minutes of picture taking. The built-in macro zoom feature is a personal favorite because it does wonders to flowers. Kind of wish the optical zoom was stronger, maybe like x6 optical, x12 digital. I have yet to take full advantage of the Memory Stick to disk transfer feature, although I've done it a couple of times. Oh, but don't buy this camera for it's mpeg ablity, because it really doesn't have any. (I mean it does, but it's so poor that it's not worth talking about.) If Sony comes out with a FD Mavica with 3MP or more, I would strongly recommend it.","Working at Office Max gave me the privalige of fully trying out this camera.  I was somewhat pleased.<br />It's resolution of 2mp is border-line ideal for printing on glossy or matte finishings.  There will be some graininess however that will always be the case until you get a camera with a resolution of 4mp or higher.  And it is also border-line ideal for internet usage.  The file size of the pictures it takes is in the moderate range so if you e-mail them to a person who has dial-up, it won't clog up their ISP too much.<br />I was not at all pleased with the movie feature.  Who would honestly need a 15 seccond movie clip?  Unless you deal in obscene webpages, I would not recomend using the movie mode.  On top of that, it's resolution is not that great for movies.<br />It's control functions are basic, straight forward and dummy proof.  The floppy mavicas are easily the most easy to use digital cameras.  They are convienient and the memory is very easily mobile as compared to compact flash or smart media.<br />I love the floppy disk option.  In fact I own the FD-75 which I would recomend over this camera any day because you don't want to use the movie mode and the resolution is more ideal for interent.  And if you want to spend that much on this camera, I would recomend buying the cd mavicas, they cost a little more but you get 3 times the results.","I am a professional radiographer and photographer (25 years now) and I used both the Sony CD400,<br />  CD300, as well as a Nikon Coolpix for this year's field research season x-raying mummies in<br />  Peru. Last year we used 2 of the Sony floppy disk/memory stik cameras.  This means the cameras were pushed hard.....blowing sand, huge contrast ranges, high<br />  resolution radiographs needed, fast manual control of radical light conditions, etc.....essentially<br />  most of the tough conditions and imaging requirements you can imagine. Here's what I found:<br />  The Sony Mavica CD300 beat them all. It's not the most expensive or the best resolution but we<br />  all thought it did the best job.<br />  Mavica CD400: best resolution but extremely slow recording time made it impossible to work with<br />  most of the time....the CD300 often got 3-4 shots while the 400 was recording one.<br />  Mavica CD300: not the best resolution, but now that I've done some prints for publication from it's<br />  highest res setting I will not be buying any more 400s....just not a significant enough difference,<br />  plus it's not as heavy or bulky.<br />  Nikon Coolpix: not in the running by comparison with the Sonys....although it is more<br />  lightweight....we are buying mini CDs for 33 cents each in bulk... and getting 140-180 high res<br />  images per CD.....they are so easy to format, initialize, and copy on any CD burner that I can't<br />  believe we even considered using memory stiks, or USB downloads.<br />  The best features are common to both the Sony Mavica CD300 and 400 series though.....manual<br />  control of the images, excellent close up abilities, decent wide angle (which can be enhanced with<br />  add-on lenses if necessary), and both rapid video and automatic functions with night focusing for<br />  flash, etc., etc.<br />  Finally! There is a great digital camera, it's just not this one.....check out the CD 300 series....about the same money but I think you will be a lot happier.","I have had my FD200 for about 2 weeks and generally I'm very happy with it.  I have used an older Mavica floppy only based camera in the past.  The floppies are convenient for moving the data to different computers, but the capacity is low and they are slow.  With the FD200 (and FD100), Sony has created the best of multiple worlds.  Using a Memory Stick allows much faster picture storage and the ability to save a much larger number of photos, and the USB connection allows fast downloading of photos to computers that have USB.  Retaining the floppy drive gives the flexibility to download photos to computers that don't have the USB capability.  Although I will normally use the USB connection when I'm at home, the floppy capability has already come in handy.<br />  Picture quality is just fine, and the basic operations of the camera are easy to use and for the most part self explanitory.  Some of the menu items take a little effort to learn all that can be done with the camera.<br />  The FD200 is one of the larger digital cameras so if you are looking for a camera that you can almost hide in your hand, this is not the camera for you.  In my case, the larger size is an advantage.<br />  There are a couple of items that I wish were different.  The strobe is rather weak, and really only useful to around 10 feet (maybe less).  There is no ability to connect an external flash unit.  At close range, it's overpowering and I find that I partially cover the flash with my finger to block some of the light.  The older Mavica camera I had used had a 10X optical zoom, and Sony has put only a 3X optical zoom on the FD200 and FD100.  I really wish that the FD200 had a better optical zoom.<br />  There are very little in the way of manual controls for exposure.  If you really want to be able to engineer your photos, look for something else.  In my case, for \"formal\" photography I will generally use a film camera which has full manual controls if I want to use them.  Most of my use of the digital camera will be for taking photos that will either go onto a web page or get E-Mailed.  The FD200 does a fine job for those purposes.<br />  One of the reasons that I wanted the floppy capability is that I often go to remote locations where I have an unknown (often old) computer to which I need to download photos.  This past week I was at a firecamp (for a brush fire) and the computer I needed to download the photos to had a USB port, but Windows 95 wont recognize it, so I was unable to use the USB.  Because of the floppy drive, I was able to download the photos to the computer before I returned home.<br />  Recommended if you need the floppy capability."]},{"name":"Samsung Digimax 130","amazon_reviews":["It was in good shape but I could not get my computer to recanise the camera.so I do not know what to do .
