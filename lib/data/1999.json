It's easy to use (and I agree with most of the comments below) and takes good quality pix. (Most of mine are flowers/birds.) I use the NiMH rechargeable batteries - have two sets - and have no problems; they last much longer than the NiCD ones. I use a Microtek reader connected to my Mac's usb port (and with an earlier Mac, used a card.)<br />My only big complaint is the lag time between seeing and taking the shot - often a problem with birds. Question: are any of the cards better/quicker than others? I have a SanDisk. I am also thinking about upgrading to the 995, but wish it used AA batteries.","this is a great camera for the money, BUT there are so many things that are needed after the purchase. ac adapter, bigger flashcard, flashcard reader, camera bag, another lens, because of the lens, a flash attachment. This all adds up to alot of money. More than I had wanted to pay. I should have done more homework, before buying.  I still love the camera. Would I do it over again? Not sure.  k.","I have had a Nikon Coolpix 800 for just over a year - and have found it to be pretty good. What people say about the image quality is correct - it is excellent!<br />A couple of hints:<br />1) Don't ever drop it, bang it or travel with it unless it is VERY well padded. The lens mechanism is quite flimsy and costs more than the camera (!!) to fix<br />2) Buy a Compact Flash reader - don't even think about downloading photos any other way - its just not worth it<br />The comments that other reviewers have made about the lack of paper manual, flimsy battery door, and battery consumption are correct ... but the first twio you eventually get used to - and the last seems to be true of most digital cameras.<br />Buy it as a starter camera ... be REALLY careful with it ... and you'll get some pretty good photos!","I purchased this camera over 6 months ago and have used it extensively(hundreds of photos so far). The camera is fantastic for outdoor photography in bright sunlight but not very good for shooting indoors or in very low lightconditions. The range of the integrated flash is extremely limited and \"flahsed\" photos appear extremely cool (blue-ish). P>Minor quirks aside, I have to say that I am very happy with this camera and I have completely stopped using film cameras since I got it. As I said before, photos taken in bright sunlight look absolutely fantastic, with great colors and no artifacts (even when compressed to JPG). Also, this is one of the only cameras in this price range that has a manual mode in which you are free to tinker with almost every aspect of picture-taking. You can set manual focus, F-stops and much more. If you like to take control of your photography and don't want to spend a fortune you should definitely take a closer look at this one.<br />Oh yeah... and get a bigger memory card (32MB+). The 8MB card shipped with this camera is inadequate for high-resolution photography. And while you're at it, get a USB card reader too.","I called Nikon recently to complain about the flash picture problems I wrote on 05/15/2001. I got a quick but partial solution. The solution works only in Manual REC mode: 1. Select M-REC mode; 2. Press MENU button; 3. Select RESET ALL (to the default values); 4. Set SENS to 200 or 400. The Manual flash picture is much better (about 15-20 feet vs 10 feet). But, the Auto flash and the SLOW SYNC are still problems. Daylight pictures are excellent. Nikon did a very poor job in quality control and in communicating this problem to their registered customers. My experience shaked my confidence to all other Nikon products.","...I have used this camera for more than 6 months, I found the following situations where Nikon 800 produced extremely disappointing flash pictures, even with ISO-400 and exposure compensation:<br />1. Out-door Slow Sync Flash (low light or night light) - Shutter speed is too slow to obtain a clear picture (no way to change).<br />2. Out-door Regular Flash (night light) - You can't see any landscape.<br />3. In-door Flash (dark wall/wall paper) - Bright colors turn into grey.<br />4. In-door Flash (large room or long hall way) - Colorful background turns into grey.<br />I think the problem is the Nikon firmware. I have seen other cheaper cameras produced much better night and low-light pictures.","I totally hated this camera the first week I owned it. The manual was misprinted and impossible to make sense of, the software was (and still is) the worst and I dropped it and broke the battery door the second day I had it. Here's some things you should know: It eats AA batteries for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Exspect to buy a lot of batteries, even if you buy the AC adapter (which they should include anyway). The software only transfers the images to the computer. That's it. You can't rename the thumbnails until you have them downloaded.  You only get 15 images on high res 1600 x 1200 and 100 images on low res. If you plan to e mail the images to be reproduced on photographic paper, you must use high res. You rarely need the flash. Turn it off while you are shooting. If you break the battery door, call the customer service, pay $18.00 and replace the door yourself. 3 little screws, no problem. Buy a larger capacity \"flash card\". This will increase the number of photos you can take before having to download.  Hi res takes twice as long to download that low res. That's about it!If you need further assistance, e mailme...Bill Peary","I have no problem with the batteries or compact flash storage capacity.  I like the low price for this product, which is being phased out.  I bought a SanDisk Image Mate.. to load the pics into my computer.  Overall a great buy!","Fantastic entry-level Nikon digital camera. Beautiful colors and sharpness, compact size, Nikon optics and a very good price. Here are some recommendations to make your Nikon 800 experience more enjoyable:<br />1. You need a large size (64M or larger)USB-enabled compactflash (like Lexar) or a USB compact flash reader to make transfers fast. The serial interface on the camera is too slow.<br />2. Make your own hand-strap. An elastic cat leash cut to size from the local pet store is the best.<br />3. Order a UV filter to cover and protect the lens.<br />I love my Nikon 800. Highly recommended.<br />2.","Heard about the images this camera and the 880 gave, and they are great!  This is not a point and shoot camera, because you have to override some of the automatic settings when there is backlight or even frontlight.  I would not recommend it for anyone who hasn't had a 35 MM that they had to tweak the picture.  The best thing about this complaint is that you can view the picture immediate and reshoot it again.  One reason I got the 800 instead of 880 is that it takes 4 AA batteries and the 4 AA rechargeables are less costly.","For the most part, I'm quite happy with my Coolpix 800 (bought at Amazon.com).  It certainly gets the job done, and the images are as good as what I've gotten with my 35mm SLR, if not better.  My main beefs are the ones that are well known about this camera:  the flash and zoom are both very limited (to the point where I pretty much consider this an outdoor camera - the one time that I did use it indoors extensively,  I set the sensitivity to ISO-400 and shot by available light), and I wish it were possible to manipulate the f-stop and shutter speed directly.  And I've got a new beef:  Due to the small size of the camera,  it is nearly impossible to use it without getting thumb prints all over the LCD screen.  But these notwithstanding, it is a great camera that takes good, well exposed crisp pictures, and that's the bottom line.","Got my Nikon 800 a month ago and have now had the chance to try it out. I have no qualms in saying picture quality is very good. My additional comments would be the same as many others; you get a lot of camera for your money in the Nikon 800. However, plan on spending an additional [sum] on a USB SmartCard reader, ...for a set of NiMH batteries and recharger (get the best, with 1600mAH capacity)... ... for a 32MB SmartCard. In fact I purchased a 64MB Sandisk card from Amazon... and on the 'normal' jpeg setting you will get 128 pictures. Finally, the carrying pouch that comes with the camera is useless as it offers zero protection against knocks.  You'll want to get something more substantial.  Other Dislikes: Plastic feel of camera body. Lense location on the far right hand side of the camera body (careful fingers!). SmardCard cover feels as if it will snap off, if even slightly mishandled. Those comments don't detract from what is still a great digital camera purchase.","I wanted a digital camera for all the usual reasons. In addition to its usefulness for emailing, my second reason is that I take hundreds of snapshots yearly that I throw out as soon as I get home - sometimes, while still at Kinko's.  It seemed like such a great idea to be able to delete all my duds - before any tree ever has to die for them, or (gasp) any photo lab worker has to see them.<br />This is a great little camera. It is truly a simple-to-use, lightweight thing. I agree with all the praise.  I wish I had known at the outset (if only to spare myself the headache) that the instruction manual - the good, big, complete one that I wanted to read cover-to-cover - is on a CD rom.  Don't plan on reading it in bed, unless you want to first print all 54 pages. The little \"quick\" booklet (missing much material)  that comes in the package has a loosely organized table of contents to the CD, but, inexplicably, no page numbers that would correspond to the topics in the printed material, so you must search.<br />You must buy separate photo-editing software, unless you want to send your nice little photos only to have your recipient download them in in that ridiculous huge size we've all seen.  In addition you will not be able to modify your photos in any way without the software.<br />Four double A batteries were used up in an hour of snapping, viewing, deleting, snapping. When the batteries begin to wear out, the camera gets sluggish, and then it's time. A  rechargeable battery pack (or two) is a must.<br />An excellent feature of any Nikon camera is that the Nikon tech support line is a twenty- four hours a day, seven days a week operation. This is incredible.  I had a few glitches with the Nikon software, and phoned several times. I was helped right away - efficiently and well. That alone is a fantastic plus, especially for someone who is not particularly good with new gadgetry. Terrific.","I bought the camera after reading the reviews and checking consumers report. for the money this camera is great. i do not use it alot and am still getting used to it but so far so good. i recommend this camera.  i did get a great price plus a rebate. that helped me make the move and i am glad i did it.  k.","After careful searching for the right digital camera I purchased this honey.  I have been thrilled with all aspects of my Nikon Coolpix 800.  It is so lightweight (usually carried a Canon with 300 zoom lens) . . it fits in my purse.  The macro is amazing.  It was bad weather here, so I went to Meiers store and photographed . . . jelly beans, colored foil wrapped kisses, flowers, people . . . all without a flash.  They came out beautifully.  The battery life is great.  I have used mine for over two weeks and it is just now run down.  I did buy the USB card reader . . .a must have.  I also had to go to the HP web site and download a driver update for my scanner to make it work.  All in all I truly love this little camera.  I am an artist who works from photos . . . I have the whole world at my fingertips now with no waiting for processing.  Best buy for your money .  It's worth twice the price.","I just bought my Nikon Coolpix 800 through Amazon (good buying experience, by the way, the camera was shipped within the two weeks Amazon said it would be).  This camera is my second digital camera, replacing a 640 x 480 clunker.  My choice was based on determining that 1600 x 1200 resolution would be sufficient for my needs, and the Nikon seeming to give the best pictures in that resolution range on the review sites (epinion.com, megapixel.net, etc.).  So far, this camera has not disappointed me.  The picture quality is excellent.  The quality is as good as, or better than anything I have ever gotten with a 35mm SLR.  I have gotten great compliments from photographic friends for the quality of pictures that I have emailed them that were taken with this camera.  The camera does lack aperture- or shutter-priority options, but you can finesse around that with the EV control.  I am also pleased with the black and white and VGA options.  The VGA setting is 640 x 480 resolution, but still better quality than my old one.  This is good if you only plan to email a picture to someone or use it on a web site.  I also like the ability to adjust white balance, including manual white balance adjustments.  All in all,  a great picture taking digital camera for the money.","I am really enjoying this camera. It is very easy to use as a point and shoot camera as well as having the manual mode for the more advanced user. I am the in between user. I have been enjoying learning how to take great shots with this camera.<br />The paper book manual is very basic and will get you started right away. It is really easy to get started. It also has a little \"quick guide\" pamphlet so you can find basic functions fast. Then it comes with an in-depth reference manual on a CD-ROM. This I felt was a little inconvenient. I'd rather be able to page through a book quickly to find what I need, but others may like the CD-ROM manual. But I would not let that deter you from buying this camera.<br />I bought this camera because of the higher resolution (the 2.11 megapixels) to be able to print quality photos. I plan on using Amazon's Ofoto site to have them printed as well as printing them on my Epson. Of course I love to email my photos to everyone as well. But so far the picture quality is great. Especially outdoor shots. The flash for indoor shots could be stronger. This seems to be the norm with digicams having a harder time indoors. Up close is fine but the back of the room is dark. There are ways around that using the manual mode.<br />The software that came with the camera was very generic. So if you are very into editing, I would buy additional photo editing software.<br />Additional things that I bought were rechargeable batteries and a charger. I drained the batteries that came with the camera in one day of usage. The LCD really drains the batteries.<br />I also bought a 64mb compactflash card from Lexar. The 8mb is just not enough. Especially if you were to go on vacation. The Lexar card came with a jumpshot cable (a memory reader). It was very reasonabley priced. You just plug the cable into the USB port in your computer. Then you take the memory card out of the camera and put it into the reader. This helps out because you don't have to plug your camera in all the time to download your photos and it won't waste the batteries. Plus it is faster than the serial cable that comes with the camera. One thing I might mention about Lexar's jumpshot cables is that they will only read Lexar cards. But for the price of the card that included the jumpshot cable it was well worth it. And it was so easy to use.<br />I still plan on getting a nicer case for my camera. One with more padding. And if you were go on vacation, you would need a spot for the batteries, the charger and also the software if you need to download it to a computer.<br />All in all I am very happy with my purchase. I had been researching it more months on sites like Megapixel.net and ZDNET as well as other camera reviewing sites. The price was exceptional for the quality of this camera and I would highly recommend it.","This is a great camera! I have had it for only a few hours and have taken several great pictures.  This is my first experience with a digital camera.  i feel vert comfortable with it.  It is virtually ready to use out of the box.  All I need now is a larger memory card and I will be ready for my vacation.","Wow!  What a bargain!  At a price less than most of the competition (cameras w/ at least 2 megapixels), the Nikon Coolpix 800 is a steal.  This camera has many advanced features, many found on higher-end cameras, although it's still simple enough for novice users, like me, to handle.  With a quick skim the manual you will be off and running.  The layout of the camera is very logical and easy to navigate.  Most people will probably use the autofocus although a manual focus mode is avaliable for more \"advanced\" options for photo-taking.  The autofocus is terrific and allows the user to have a \"point-and-click\" attitude to digital photo imaging while encompassing the advantages of the incoming \"digital age.\"  The TFT LCD screen allows you to have a great view of pictures you have taken and stored on the compact flash card.  The LCD on-screen menu is extremely easy to operate.  It produces superb pictures rivaling many higher resolution cameras.  With a decent printer, you could produce photos detailed enough to rival that of regular 35mm \"professional\" development. The print quality is great and it is enhanced by high quality photo paper.  It is a good idea to do plenty of research on the digital camera topic before you purchase one since it is quite an investment even for the \"cheaper\" cameras.  The included 8mb compact flash card is decent, holding 16 \"normal\" detail 1600X1200 photos, although I would recomend purchasing a larger capacity one (i.e. 16mb+).  Another additional bonus would be to purchase a compact flash reader to download the images.  They are relatively cheap and reduce the download time.  Rechargeable batteries would be an added plus since the LCD display is a battery drainer.  Another important accessory would be a high-quality carring case considering the amount of money put into the camera.  Overall the Nikon Coolpix 800 is a great camera at a bargain price.","I received my Nikon Coolpix800 in the mail on Friday, almost in time to get all the nights of Chanukah.  I took it to the dinner that evening and took pictures of the kids and other congregants.  I also took it home and took some great close-up shots.  You can't necessarily tell how the picture will come out just from looking at the LCD screen, but when the pictures were viewed on my computer, they were really nice.  The pictures were clear.  Even though the room wasn't that light, the pictures were fairly bright.  I forgot to change the focus to distance for one picture of the kids on the stage, so it didn't come out that great--oops.  Also, the close-up shots were really nice--even in darkness or low light, when the LCD screen won't show anything, the pictures come out clear and bright.  I noticed two things I thought were unusual.  The first is that the pictures seem to be better when the zoom lens is low or zoomed-out.  If I used the close zoom as opposed to simply moving closer, the picture seemed darker and less clear.  The second--the batteries did start to go low later in the evening.  So, I plugged in the A/C adapter.  I forgot to unplug it, and the batteries were fully-charged in the AM.  I don't think I was sent rechargeable batteries, but having the A/C adapter seems to extend the battery life, so, though I saw the low battery light in the evening on the first night I started taking pictures.  I have used the camera with and without the A/C adapter, and I am still on the first set three days and 40 pictures later. I also do recommend having the USB CompactFlash system to download pictures--it takes seconds to download about 8MB.  I bought a larger disk (32MB) and have used over a quarter of the pictures, and it takes less than 30 seconds to download all of the pictures--they appear quickly and clearly.  I am considering keeping the disks and just buying more like I would buy film for negatives, as the picture quality decreases when I put them into programs on my computer.","Like everything about the camera except it is not 'twain' compatible and means a lot unnecessary moving of data to utilize various, good graphic programs. So, for the price, it is a good performer but had I known the above fact in advance, I would have purchased something else.","I've been a camera nut for over 30 years, but have always used 35mm or 2-1/4 film.  I have had my Nikon 800 for 6 weeks now and doubt I will ever use film again.<br />The photo quality is fantastic.  Using the normal setting, about 500kb/photo(the high res is about twice the size), the 4x6 prints are indistinguishable from 35mm and are comparable at 8x10.  The ability to image both the light and dark portions (ie the shaddowed areas in a bright sunshine shot) of a photo are far superior to film.  My prints on an HP 862 printer using \"best print quality\" and Kodak glossy premium picture paper are photo shop quality.<br />It is very easy to use. I have spent less than 5 minutes with the manual.  I have shot almost everything on auto exposure with great results. I have had no problem with exposures too dark.<br />Three small negatives (pun intended),  the cycle time between exposures can exceed 2 seconds, the flash is weak, and the Pictureworks/HotShots software included is cumbersome.  The exposure speed, iso 100 equivilent, can be frustrating in low light situations, but this is common to all digital cameras.<br />You do need to buy a 36 or 64mb... flash card to hold 60 to 120 photos until you can download to yourcomputer.  The 8mb that comes with this (and most other) camera only holds 8 to 16 images.  A SanDisk USB flash card reader...  will quicken the transfer to your computer and save batteries.","After reading just about every review I could find, I finally purchased the Coolpix 800.  I was looking for a camera that was above 2 mega pixels and $500 or below.  I have read some of the reviews about the low quality of pictures in a dark room, but after playing with the light meter adjustment I did not have any problems with the quality of brightness of the photo.  I even went to the extreme and took some close up photos, outside, in total darkness of a Hybiscus bush.  The photo showed incredible detail and deep rich color from the flowers. I also read some of the complaints about the auto focus always being on and drawing on battery power.  This is only the case if you leave it on this setting.  You can set it to only auto focus when you press the shutter half way.<br />The pros for this camera are: It's easy to figure out.  Takes great pictures. Has lots of features for manual and automatic photos.  You can even take black and white photos. Different lens settings like fisheye and wide angle. Manual and Auto settings.  LCD screen is incredible.  It does have a lens cover. and it is fairly compact.  It's a lot of fun shooting pictures just to see what kind of results you get with the manual settings.  I was able to have fun with this camera right out of the box.<br />My only complaints are that I wish it came with a power supply, the battery cover is a little flimsy, and the software that comes with the camera isn't anything to get all excited over.<br />Bottom line is if I had to buy it again I would do it gladly and without hesitation.<br />Hope this makes your descision a little easier.","I got this from Amazon.com 3 days ago and is still shooting away. Sharp pictures, excellent focusing & light weight.<br />Here are some negative points if that's what you are looking for -<br />1. It is a battery hogger. The 4 energizer (alkaline) battery pack that came with the camera lasted only for about 20 pictures. You NEED rechargeable NiMH battery. .... Andthe charger is [even more money]. You don't really need the optional AC adapter. It is just another thing to load the electrical outlet near the PC.<br />2. The 8MB CompactFlash card is just not enough if you want to stick to the 1600x1200 resolution which is the default. At normal compression, you can have only 16 pictures. I feel that 640x480 resolution should have been the default. 640x480 is only available in advanced options. At 640x480, the 8MB card can hold 102 pictures at normal compression which is good enough for me. But if you want to stick to 1600x1200, you may be better off considering a card with more capacity.<br />I decided not to reduce the number of stars because of these negative points because the quality easily makes up for them and these negative points may be unavoidable (as in the case of battery usage) or not applicable to all (as in the case of resolution & storage size).<br />I had been using Nikon N50 (non-digital) for years and had fallen love with that camera. I guess the N50 will have to excuse me now !!","The camera has no USB connector--it uses a serial wire, which means it can connect to most PCs or older Macs, but needs an adapter or a USB-enabled flash card for newer Macs. Apart from that it takes good pictures and at the price it's selling for now it's a good entry into digital photography. The optional lenses are great and will transfer to other Nikon models later if you upgrade.<br />I prefer the form factor of the 900/950/990 even though they are bigger, because of the way the body twists. This makes it so you can see the LCD when you're holding the camera over your head pointing down, or down by your knees pointing up. Great for pics of kids, crowds, etc. The Nikon 900 series are the only still cameras I know of that do this.","The Nikon Coolpix 800 is a wonderful camera for the price and has some outstanding features typically found on higher-priced models.  The automatic picture taking mode does a good job of metering and focusing while the manaul mode gives the user the ability to change ISO, exposure, white balance and focus.  I have had the camera in the dark, wet depths of slot canyons in Utah to the high, snowy country of Colorado.  It has performed well in a variety of temperatures and has held up to a number of good hard knocks.  An optional 28mm wide angle lens attachment is great.  The only items that detract from the allure of this camera are: The flash is a bit weak.  The serial port connection is slow, get a USB card reader.  NiMH batteries are a must (But that holds true for just about any digital camera product).  The included 8MB card is not hardly enough.  Buy at least a 32MB card.  You won't be disappointed with this camera, I'm very pleased with it!","I'm very happy with my new Nikon Coolpix 800 camera. First of all the body is a nice size and shape. It's very easy to carry around and fits in even small purses, and feels quite durable. Second, it takes very good pictures! The quality of my prints from Amazon.com Photo Services by Ofoto is excellent. I take the pictures with the camera resolution set to \"fine\" and the 4x6 and 5x7 prints are excellent. Third, the automatic settings are smart enough to do the work for you, and it's fun to play with the self metering also.  Fifth, it's cool to have Nikon brand camera.  The only things I wish this camera had are a stronger zoom lens and a stronger flash for indoors. I'm very happy with this camera and feel I got a good deal for my first digital camera.","Since I wrote my first review, I have had the opportunity to play around with the camera and to take hundred of pictures, no doubt the camera is great, still have the problem of having a very slow lens, that requires a lot of ilumination to make those great pictures. But the reason because I am writting, this new review is to give some advices to those with the same camera: 1- Buy a battery recharger ( a 2 Hours one is great) 2- Buy 8 rechargables AA Niquel-Metal hydraide (choose a good ones, the cheaper don't last) 3- Buy a USB compact flash card reader ( The best investment! ) 4- Buy a 64 Mb compact Flash Card ( It is in most of the cases enough for a short trip) 5- Think before taking a picture, and use the features of the camera, it is so versatile that will allows you to have that great picture,  whatever the conditions, but need some practics. 6 With good illumination use the automatic setting (A)it always get the better picture. 7- With Poor condition use always Manual. set for 200 ASA or 400 ASA depending on the condition, you can even increase the apperture of the objetive manually, do so if you think is needed 8- Finally you need a good software to retouch the pictures they always need to increase the brightness, and sometimes also the gamma. I am using  CamediaMaster from Olympus and I am very happy, it is not the best for retouching, but it the best to managing  and organizing your pictures, besides you can play a slide show without need of create any album, just play the file.  Enjoy your Coolpix and play with it for as while before judging it. ...","I like the Nikon a great deal except for one fatal design blunder, totally  unexpected from a company with Nikon's reputation. The optional lenses  block most of the view finder when they're in use. As the representative  told me, you must use the LCD monitor when using the optional telephoto  lens (and apparently other lenses and digital cameras). Unfortunately, the  LCD monitor is virtually useless in dim lighting or bright sun. So this is  a very serious design error. I can recommend this camera only if you never  intend to use the optional lens.","I have had several different digital cameras, all on the samerange, and this is a great machine, that takes very sharp images, besides it allows you to manually set almost everything, which is great when you want to shot on poor conditions. A USB flashcard reader it is a must, the batteries last enough to shoot at least 100 pictures using th LCD to review the shots, no complains here. Now the down side, the metering system is always taken dark pictures that are too bad on artificial illumination, when you shoot with the flash, only the closer ( I ment 3 foot) is iluminated the rest is too dark and unreadable, only way to overcame the problem, set the ASA to 400, you will get a litle more blurry picture, but at least you will be able to see something. I do not understand why Nikon has not fixed this problem yet. I am a fan of Nikon, but something is wrong in this model, that posible could be corrected with a sofware modification. I have requested to change this unit for other to see if it is a unique problem of this one.  One advice......, ! My (other camera) makes very good pictures, always well illuminated!  EN","If your thinking about buying a digital camera for this price definitely buy this Nikon 800. The 2.1 megpixels far outshine any 1.3 mega pixels cameras. The LCD monitor is like a tv. The battery life is also excellent I  get about 1.5 hours on my rechargeables. Its completely worth the extra few  bucks, why settle for less, as they say.<br />I love this camera ive played  with some similarly priced ones(EG Canon powershot s100) but i still love  the Nikon 800. But so as to help you I'll tell you some points to note  about the camera that some people may not like.<br />1. Rechargeable batteries  are a must,eventhough the battery life is one of the longest around its  pretty much a necessity for any digital camera. Batteries + recharger cost  me 17 dollars.<br />2. The zooming capabilities on digital cameras are not  very good. However for the Nikon you can buy a telefoto lens.<br />3. The  memory card supplied with digital cameras is always the most basic. The  Nikon comes with an 8MB card which with the settings(picture quality,  picture size) that I have selected gets me about 50 pics. However at the  best pic qualtiy and largest photo size, this card can only store one  photo. However my photos show no adverse degradation in quality or size, so  I do not feel the need to buy more memory.<br />4. There are loads of manual  functions that you may never use, or use only sometimes. But it means that  everybody is happy.<br />5. It's takes alot of practice(a few days) to  capture moving objects and ensure to get the object at the precise moment  you want it.<br />6. It comes with a soft, flimsy case , you want to buy  more protection.<br />7. Downloading photos using the serial port is ok for  an 8MB card. Anything higher than 16MB may become annoying. Certainly if  your impatient get the usb card reader...<br />I would  be willing to pay a 100 bucks more for this camera its seriously that good.  The pictures produced are just of such good quality.Suffice to say Im very  happy with my purchase.","The quality of the images are very good and the 2 MB products are very much the *sweet spot* for amateurs and will be suitable for everyone except proffessionals. Be warned though that you should prepare to spend quite a  bit more than the cost of the camera. 2 sets of batteries and a recharger  are a neccessity and maybe an AC adapter as well. Nikon should try to  include a recharger, nothing kills the digital camera experience more than  realizing that your camera lasts for about 30 minutes before you need to  put in new batteries. Also the 8 MB card is useless. You can only take 1  (!) high quality uncompressed image. Factor in...for a 64 MB  Compact Flash. Likewise I havent found any image editing software (also a  negative with Nikon is you get no printed manual and the basic software is  VERY basic) so you will need to purchase some editing software.","I'm always the last guy in my group of friends to do something.  They all  graduated college before I did.  They all got married before I did.  They  all had kids before I did.  And they all bought digital cameras before I  did.  Being the last digital camera purchaser had its advantages, though.  I got to learn from all of their mistakes!  I have a friend with the  Olympus 460, one with a Nikon Coolpix 950 (the fancier version of the 800),  and one with a Kodak 280.  They all bring their cameras along on hikes and  camping trips, so I was able to see all of the pros and cons to help me  make my own purchase.  I decided that I wanted 2 mega-pixels and optical  zoom.  I also didn't want to spend more than $500.  I ruled out the Olympus  right away, because it only has a 1.2 mega-pixel image size and I want at  least 2 mega-pixels so I can make 5x7s or even 8x10s.  Of course, after I  bought my Coolpix 800, I learned that Olympus is coming out with a 2  mega-pixel version of the 460, so if I were buying it today, I'd have to  reconsider. After ruling out the Olympus, I was left with the Kodak DC280  and the Coolpix.  My friend's 950 was outside of my budget, but that's OK,  because I didn't like the shape of the 950 (weird twisty thing) or its  size.  The 800 is smaller and looks and feels like a normal camera.  If you  compare the 800 to the Kodak DC280, they basically look identical.  2x  optical zoom, 3x digital zoom, Compact Flash card, AA batteries, optical  viewfinder, LCD display, etc...they're nearly identical.  In the end, I  figured \"Kodak mostly makes instamatics, and Nikon makes lots of  high-quality 35mm cameras\".  I've heard lots of great things about  Nikon film cameras, and figured that this technology would carry over to  their digital cameras.  Besides, with the rebate, the Nikon is  cheaper!<br />I'm totally thrilled with my decision.  The pictures are  fantastic, and the camera never fails to amaze me with its flexibility.  Though it's not as fancy as the 950, it's LOTS cheaper and is easier to  carry.  Look around: if you want a 2 mega-pixel camera with an optical  zoom, you can count on spending $500 or $550.  This camera has all the  features I need with an awesome price!  Definitely happy with my purchase,  and happy with the quick painless service I received from Amazon.<br />I can  recommend this camera without reservations.  You won't outgrow it any time  soon, and you can't go wrong with a Nikon lens.","This is the 3rd digital camera I've purchased.  My first model was a 640x480, which looked good in emails, but was really lacking when I tried to print my pictures out.  Next came a megapixel model, which was better,  because it made prints look good, but I couldn't zoom or crop much before  my pictures started looking fuzzy.  It was time for a 2 megapixel model.  I  looked at the Coolpix 950, but it was too big and too expensive.  I looked  at the Canon digital elph too.  It's small and cute, but in my opinion  isn't worth the extra money. I looked at a few other models too,  but I kept coming back to the Nikon.  I think that most people agree that  Nikon optics are about the best available, and they have a good track  record with previous models of film and digital cameras...<br />Good stuff: GREAT pictures; Nikon lens; optical (not digital)  zoom (though not quite as powerful as some); Compact Flash (personal  preference, maybe, but available in bigger capacities); Much more compact  than the 950, with most of the features and the same resolution.<br />Not as  good: have almost lost the lens cap several times already; batteries don't  last too long with lcd on; get rechargeables!<br />Unless you're a hardcore  photographer, this should have all of the manual abilities and photo  quality you need.  If you are a hardcore photographer, you probably want  one of the 3 megapixel models instead...<br />For me, the Coolpix 800 is 80%  of a new Olympus 3030 or a Coolpix 990, but for less than half the price.  Bargain!","The Nikon Coolpix 800 is hard to beat. It's easy to use, produces great quality photos and the price is second to none.<br />I have tried other digital cameras -- Kodak, Olympus, Sony, and more expensive Nikons -- and  this one is by far the most impressive. I use the camera for newspaper and  magazine work, and am quite happy. So is my editor.<br />To save batteries, I  turn the LDC monitor off, except for a brief viewing. And, I purchased a  PCMCI adapter, which enables me to read the photos very quickly. This makes  downloading the photos much more simple and less time consuming.<br />There  are a few minor problems with the camera. The biggest is that the zoom is  disappointing compared to other mega pixel cameras -- even with the  optional teleconverter lens. Here's why: The converter blocks the  viewfinder, forcing the photographer to use the LCD monitor, which means  batteries don't last as long.<br />Still, I'm pleased with the purchase.","I bought this camera having never used digital, and I must say I was stunned! It is VERY easily used, and even if you're not electronically inclined, you'll figure it out in about 15 with the help of the QuickStart  guide that comes with it. I will say that for a more advanced  user/experienced photographer, it may seem a little elementary; you can't  change shutter speed (this is automatic), F-stop has very limited  variability, zoom is so-so (though there are a variety of accessory lenses  you can purchase).<br />As for batteries, do yourself a favor and buy some  NiMH rechargeable batteries (takes 4 AA) at radio shack, where a set of  four plus the charger is only 19.99. This Camera is a ravenous,  battery-devouring beast, and you will have to change batteries after 45  mins if you use alkaline. With the NiMH, I have yet to kill them- they last  forever.<br />The auto mode is very user friendly, and does just about  everything for you. The manual mose allows you to change around things a  bit (but does limit you, for example the shutter I mentioned)<br />There are  several different resolutions you can use (the default is 1600x1200, but  you can shoot 640x480 or smaller), and also several shooting options like  16-shot which takes 16 shots over the course of about 5-8 secs, bestshot  which will take 10 and the camera decides which is the best. Or you can  take up to 40 frames per second.<br />You might want to get an extra or larger  memory card because even though they say it holds 200 pictures, this is a  bit stretched. It will hold about 30 basic quality, 16 normal quality, 8  fine quality or 1 high quality in the 1600x1200 mode, and about 200, 100,  50, 5 in the 640x480 mode. Though I WILL say that the 640x480 VGA mode is a  good mode because even a 19\" monitor cannot display a 1600x1200 shot,  and part of it will always be off screen, whereas the 640x480 almost  perfectly fits the screen (I use the 640x480 VGA mode myself). Plus the  1600x1200 shoty takes quite a qhile to upload.<br />Summing it up, if you have  never used a digital before, you will be surprised off you A-- at how easy  it is to use and take good photos. If you are a professional or have  experience, you might want to go with the 900, 950, or 990.<br />I give it 4.5  stars","The Nikon Coolpix 800 is a GREAT camera.  I don't understandwhat the other comments are complaining about.  Mine came with aninstruction booklet, a foldout \"getting started\" sheet (which was very well written), and a CD for more detailed instruction. But, all I needed was the starter sheet, 15 minutes of trying it out, and found it was intuitively simple.  I also didn't have trouble with battery life (I used the alkalines that came with it).  I took 20 pictures, downloaded them into my computer and STILL had PLENTY of battery life.  This is a nice compact camera with some great features...This is an amazing camera at an amazing price - and I am usually very finicky.  I'd recommend this camera whole-heartedly.","I came very close to purchasing the CoolPix 990 or Olympus C3030Z for twice the price of the CP800, but after a few days with this little gem I am very pleased with my choice. The extra money is well spent on accessory  lenses, rechargable NiMH batteries, memory cards and reader.<br />The 2X  optical zoom is not a big issue if you add on a telephoto lens -- the  current Nikons all support add on lenses with their threaded barrel, using  the properly sized adapter rings.  Keep in mind that the digital zoom on  the 800, and most digital cameras, results in severe noise and distortion.  I doubt I'll ever use the digital zoom.<br />Image quality is superb, and I  have found myself marvelling at the sharpness of pics shot at full res  (1600x1200) in fine mode, even at fully automatic settings.  Color and  white balance seem very natural, and of course are user-settable in manual  mode. Nikon's expertise in quality optics and metering is very evident  here.<br />Minor concerns are that the battery cover area seems flimsy, and  also the optical viewfinder must be used with the right-eye to avoid severe  nose-smudging of the large LCD, which is flush with the rear case and dead  center so right in nose territory!<br />User interface is quite friendly and  easily mastered with a bit of experimentation on the menus.<br />You WILL want  a USB or PC-card CompactFlash reader as the camera does not include USB  support natively. Serial port transfers are a joke with files this big  (600-900K per pic)!<br />I highly recommend this camera to intermediate  photographers who want more resolution, manual control, and lens options  than a low-end device, but do not need all the bells and whistles of the  $800+ 3-megapixel \"big guns\".","This is one great tiny camera!  I was kinda shocked by how small it was when I first opened it but it's compact size betrays the many features hidden within it's frame.  However, this may be a downfall to someone with  big hands so if you do you may want to find one at a camera or electronics  store before you buy.<br />There was one thing that I did find annoying and  that was the online manual.  The manual is pretty informative but if you  are like me and are outdoors a bit...well the online manual won't do you  anygood, so read up before you try and leave home with it.<br />Other than  those two very minor features this camera more than does the job.  It is  very lightweight and compact yet it has the ability to add various other  lenses from fisheye, macro, and a telephoto.  The flash is powerful enough  to handle most any shot and you have the option to change the film speeds  to compensate even further.  It shoots in standard form at 1600x1200 but  can be reduced to 640x480.  If you want to take high speed pictures, you  have the option from single, continuous, up to an amazing 40 continuous  shots.  This is my first digital camera so I don't know if others have  these features but for the price and the size I can almost bet you are not  going to find one that rivals this little Nikon in quality.  I would highly  recommend this camera to anyone.","I must admit that I like having new electronic toys when they come out.  I purchased a digital camera in 1997 and was not entirely impressed by what 500$ got me then.  However, 3 years later, I stumbled upon the Nikon  Coolpix 800 at a great price and took another shot at digital  imaging.<br />PICTURES: The pictures it takes are fantastic!  The 1600x1200  resolution really makes a difference when making prints.  They look like  they were taken with a 35mm.  This is not even mentioning the backing of a  quality Nikkor lens that picks up lots of detail other digicams of the same  resolution do not.  Another feature that impressed me was the fact I could  add additional lenses to it (and Nikon has 3 designed specifically for the  Coolpix 800/950/990).<br />FEATURES: It has a lot of features of its bigger  brother like an uncompressed TIFF format, ability to take B&W pictures,  and adjustable metering.  However, for a non-professional photographer, I  liked the fact the auto mode was easy to use and allowed me to take great  pictures right away.  I now can switch to manual mode to take more control  of the picture, but the camera is ready to take great pictures right out of  the box.  Unlike other reviewers, mine came with a paper manual in addition  to a CD-ROM that explained many of the basic features and taught me about  some of the more exotic ones.<br />This is a great camera for anyone wanting a  digital camera that takes great pictures but doesn't want to spend ton of  money on features that may not even be used.  Otherwise, the CP990 and the  D1 are really nice cameras for those interested in more control.  I do  recommend getting an extra Flash card since 8 MB does run out fairly  quickly when taking pictures in FINE or NORMAL mode.  Getting a USB SanDisk  CompactFlash reader was also a big help since the built-in connection is  serial and can take a LONG time to download pictures if you have a lot of  them.","The great staff at a Camera World got my camera working and it is doing fine now.  I'll stick with the Nikon800 Coolpix.","This is a great little camera.  The pictures are bright, crisp and easily managed using the camera's menu and browsing functions.  The manual is on CD but using the camera is fairly intuitive and should not take long to master.  The camera is fairly light but the construction is solid with very  little edges to catch and break off.<br />My favorite aspect is I can take  pictures using the CompactFlash card then pop the card into my CE handheld  and review the pictures without having to load to a desktop computer.  Highly recommend this as a camera for the novice to casual user.","I've had my CoolPix 800 since November and for the most part, I am very pleased with it.  The pictures are great and there are a fair amount of features that the advanced amateur will find useful.  Two major  disappointments however are the inability to control the shutter speed and  aperature, and the battery life.  Nikon's web site will lead you to believe  that you can control the shutter speed and aperature (such as when you are  taking fast action shots or photos at night), but this is not true.  Shutter speed and aperature are automatically controlled no matter what you  are shooting.  To get that kind of control, you need to be purchasing the  CoolPix 950.  Amazon's review that \"battery life is a winner\" is  a crock.  The camera eats battries at an alarming rate even with the LCD  screen switched off.  I have considered purchasing a rechargeable set, but  my solution is to buy the battries in bulk at Costco.  You can get a brick  of 48 AA Kirkland battries for about $12.  These battries are almost as  highly rated (according to Consumer Reports) as regular Duracell's and a  whole lot less expensive.  Unfortunately, not using rechargeables is not  the most environmentally friendly option.  By the way, the owners manual on  CD.  Get a clue Nikon, that one's a real pain!","The images that this camera is capable of producing will be hard to duplicate in any other digital camera that can be purchased for under $600.  Previous reviews have mentioned size, controls, and rudimentary software  as problems.<br />I don't believe Nikon or anyone else bills this camera as  a 'pocket' camera.  If size is a big criteria, consider the Canon S10. The  CP800 is easy to hold and is not so small that it is hard for someone with  larger hands to manipulate.<br />I find the controls about average for a  digital camera.  Digital cameras don't work like film cameras and require  that you develope new skills.  No matter what camera you purchase there  will always be a learning curve involved.  Most of the controls seem quite  logical and once you are used to them, cease to be a problem.<br />The Nikon  View software is simply a means of getting the images from the camera to  the computer.  From there you can use the image editing program of your  choice to modify or print your pictures.  One of the great things about a  digital camera is the fact that you CAN adjust and retouch your photos.  Many cameras download their pictures via a serial cable and they are all  slow.  USB card readers are inexpensive (around $50) and GREATLY speed up  the process.<br />One big plus is the availability of additional lenses and  filters, another feature not generally found in cameras of this price  range.<br />No one camera is a good 'fit' for every user but if what you are  looking for is great film-quality images, you won't be dissapointed with  the CP800.","I've had my Coolpix 800 for about a month now, and I can still say that I'm one proud Papa. Yeah, they eat batteries like candy, but so do most cameras with any kahonna's. Buy rechargable! The biggest drawback to this  camera is the serial port issue. There's a way around that, though. Buy a  SanDisk (they manufacture Nikon memory cards) drive and USB...uploadin'  quicker than spit. Well, now that we've bought a CompactFlash drive, some  Nickle Metal-Hydride rechargable batteries, an AC adapter, and another 48mb  of memory(or you'll be reminded of that time when you ran out of film),  we've just added about $250 to an already pricey camera. Not to fear folks.  If your reading this review, that means you have internet access. Shop  around for the best price. On-line prices will, without a doubt, beat the  human factor. Try,  Buy .com  for the camera and Spotshop.com  for the  other goodies. I saved a couple hundred easily. Oh and lastly, I wouldn't  have a digital camera without at least 2 megapixels, built in flash,  optical and LCD viewfinder, and CompactFlash(most common). There's lots of  other goodies with this one, and that's why I think this is the most camera  for it's price range.","I have virtually no digital camera experience and bought this camera about a week ago.  I did extensive on-line research and the reviews were outstanding concerning picture quality.  In this regard the reviews were  accurate. However, I mistakenly thought that picture quality was the only  necessary feature in a digital camera.  Wrong.  I have found many  disaapointing features in this camera.  First, that the camera's manual is  on disk rather than paper is LAME!  How are you supposed to read how to  download and process pictures when your computer screen is tied up reading  the manual. Second, the camera's controls are very confusing.  Many buttons  serve dual (sometimes three) functins which of course you have to memorize  because the manual is only on disk.  (There is a printed pocket guide but  it is an abbreviated version.) By the way, I printed the entire manual and  it is still the worst written electronic manual I have ever read. More  experienced digital photographers may not mind this. Third, the camera has  a cheap feel to it.  After buying it I went to a few stores to see some  others and realized how cheap the feel of this camera was.  Fourth, the  camera is an odd shape and size making it difficult to put it in your  pocket and go.  Fifth, the serial cable provided is a slow method of  transfer.  Purchase of a card reader is a must.  Sixth,  the Nikon View  software is very basic.  Thus, a photo editing program will be necessary.  Finally, the lens cap is not tethered to the camera.  While this is not a  big deal, it is inconvienant, but more importantly highlights the many  shortcomings of the camera's design.  Again, although I have many  complaints I have to admit the picture quality is exceptional.  The  question is would I buy this camera again.  Probably not.  I would trade a  slight reduction in picture quality for a better thought out camera which  is easier to use.  By the way, I have since discovered that the place I  bought it has a 30% restocking charge precluding return of the camera.  I  strongly suggest that anyone contemplating the purchase of a digetla camera  on-line go to a local store first just to handle a few diffrent models and  then check the rules regarding on-line returns.","Picture quality is superb, there is no question. There are a few minor issues that I wish I had known when I was shopping for digital cameras.  I would like to have a little more zoom capability than the 2x lens provides, as well as better macro capability (or any macro at all).  I understand  that the Coolpix 950 has both.  A flashcard disk drive is a neccessity as  battery life is very short (4 AABatteries last maybe an hour). For example,  taking and uploading 14 photos will zap 4 brand new Duracell Ultras.  I did  purchase 4 Nickel Metal rechargeable AA's and that helps ease the pain of  replacing batteries.  It would be nice if they included the AC  adapter, no question this is a must for this camera.  Uploading pictures  from the camera to PC is easy but slow with the provided software.  An  additional photo editor other that the one provided will be neccessary to  do any creative editing.<br />On the bright side, the camera has an  outstanding compact flash and is loaded with nice features that I have not  taken the time to figure out.<br />Overall, I am quite satisfied with this  camera as the quality of photos can help me overlook some of it's  shortcomings.  I am however considering an upgrade to the Coolpix 950.","This little brother to the CoolPix 950, has almost all the same features. Excellent 1.9 Million Pixels, very easy to use. The 8 meg Compact Flash holds 1-32 images in different formats. Optional A/C adapter should be included, in order to download pictures to your PC. I bought the SanDisk  Compact Flash Disk Drive and it downloads to the PC without wasting Camera batteries. Lot's of optional accessories, lenses etc."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S10","amazon_reviews":["no comment","I have owned mine for over two years now and I would have to say that it has performed up to every task I have asked of it.

It came down to the Casio 2000 and the Canon and with Amazon's great price would couldn't resist.  The Canon S10 offers many great features and is very easy to use.  My 3 year old daughter loves the idea of being able to see the picture right away so she is thrilled.<br />This camera has alot of bang for the buck","I have owned a cannon s10 for almost a year.  I am a REALTOR with a Century 21 franchise and use my camera for business and for fun.  It takes wonderful pictures at all resolutions.  It's single greatest asset though is its size.  It will fit in my jacket pocket and can be powered up and used any time.  I paid almost nine hundred dollars for the camera, power pack/battery and case when the camera first came on the market.  At it's current price point it is a bargain.  The s20 may even be worth the extra for the higher resolution depending on your needs. Also the software is easy to use and the photo stitch program for panarama shots works very well.  I wish there was an affordable second battery available.  Sometimes when your traveling it is not always easy to recharge the battery.  Do not buy the camera without buying the rechargeable battery kit.","I really have enjoyed the performance and ease of use of this camera.  Its small size makes it very easy to have available when it's needed.  Sure the S100 is smaller, but it sacrfices a few features such as an auxilliary status screen (saves batteries).  Canon really should include the power supply/recharger as the camera is not practicle without it.  There is one feature that I should point out (haven't noticed it in other reviews here): The S10 is compatible with the IBM Microdrive (as certified by both Canon and IBM).  This Microdrive replaces the meager 8MB flash memory card that comes with the camera.  It is 1/3 to 1/4 the cost of the equivalent number of flash memory cards.  Just plug in the 340MB or 1GB version and watch the picture capacity counter go through the roof.  With a 340MB Microdrive, I can take over 280 pictures of the highest resolution and least compression.  I could get over 3000 pictures at lower resolutions and quality, but why settle for sub-optimal images?  Monitors and other displays are going to improve and get bigger in the years to come (think wall-sized monitors).  Image resolution will become more apparent.  I'm planning on my digital images lasting longer than me or my children.  This is a great camera for the price.","Versitility is great with abilty to download to serial (Mac), parallel (PC), and USB (both). Beware that use of Windows 95 upgraded to 98 may not work (mine did, however). Also, an upgrade to the newer firmware may be required. The pictures are overexposed on the \"auto mode.\" Adjustments can be made manually. I'd buy it again.","After reading some of the other Amazon reviews, I felt compelled to write my own.<br />First off, I'll get the only bad thing about this camera out of the way.  You MUST buy the optional power supply kit, otherwise you will be spending an extra 20 bucks for a Lithium CR5 battery every couple of weeks.  The power supply kit, from what I have seen, goes for about 60-80 bucks, and includes the rechargable battery, charger, and A/C adapter (for operating without a battery when plugged into the wall, which comes in very handy).<br />Without buying this kit, the camera does come with the required lithium battery, serial cable for PC, serial cable for Mac, USB for PC/Mac, video cable, and an 8MB compact flash memory card.  (Wrist strap, CD-rom, manuals and camera also included, obviously)  First of all, the 8MB memory card can hold a lot more than 12 pictures, as quoted by one of the reviewers.  If you read the manual, you'll find that the S10 can take pictures in 3 different resolutions, as well as 3 different compression ratios.  In other words, 1600x1200 is a huge picture, and most normal people find 800x600 (the smallest setting) to be plenty sufficient for taking everyday pictures.  Most people's computer resolutions are set to 800x600, and a picture that size would fill up the whole screen, if that gives you any idea.  If you set the camera to 800x600 and high compression, you can put 61 pictures on the 8MB card.  These are only a couple of the good customization options I found by reading the manual.  This camera also 4x digital zoom and 2x regular zoom, which was not clarified by another reviewer.  This feature can be enabled if you turn it on in the camera settings.  It's not enabled by default.<br />Besides the zoom and large amount of picture storage, this camera can do a ton of stuff that I couldn't do on my old Fujifilm camera.  Aside from the resolution and compression options, and the 4x digital zoom, the S10 can be set to manual mode and adjusted for specific situations.  You can adjust the white balance, exposure level, object focus, and lighting condition options.  If you don't feel like fooling with all these individually, there's an \"Image\" mode which allows you to set the camera for specific conditions, like Landscape, Fast shutter, Slow shutter, Night scene, and Black and white.  And even further than this, there's a regular picture-taking mode for amateurs that allows you to just point and click while the camera automatically adjusts to the best settings.  To top it all off, there's an included slide show option that cycles through all the pictures or a specific line-up that you make, which when hooked up to the TV (via the video cable) can make for great, quick entertainment, without having to download all the pictures and show them to someone on a computer.  And for the outdoor photographer, there's an included photo-stitching mode that allows you to take several pictures, vertically or horizontally, and stitch them together seamlessly with the included software.  (I.e. taking 3 pictures of a long beach and pasting them together)<br />In summary, after reading the manual included with the S10, I found that nearly everything is included into this durable, pocket-size camera.  I'm extremely glad that I bought it, and it far outperforms my Fujifilm camera in picture quality, useablity, and transfer speeds. (with the USB cable).  Even the LCD display is much brighter and clearer!  Plus it looks cool!  It's hard to go wrong if buying this camera.  You won't be let down.","I got this camera 2 months ago, and am very satisfied with it. This camera is just right for me.","1. Turn the LCD screen off except when framing shots.  This will allow the  battery to last a long time.  2. Make sure that you have the most recent  operating system for the camera.  It should be v.1.0.0.2.  You can verify  this (via any of the included software programs) when the camera is  connected to your computer.  This firmeware upgrade corrects many of the  color imbalances as well as allowing a faster shutter speed for flash  pictures (1/30th sec. vs. 1/15th), which reduces the probability of camera  shake. 3. Don't try and install the firmware upgrade (available on the  Canon website) if you have a Mac.  I don't know the genesis of the problem  (something about the USB connection or an installation glitch) but for most  people the camera freezes during upgrade, rendering it useless.  Canon can  install this for you under warranty and are very quick on turnaround.  (I  guess this is a long winded way of saying - give it a shot, but only if  you're prepared to send it to Canon anyway).<br />I'd give it 5 stars, but the  glitch I had with the firmware upgrade irked me.  Canon did fix it promptly  and the camera works like a charm.","If you are serious about buying this product I am sure that you already  know all the specs on it and such so I will just tell you why I bought it  and what I use it for.<br />The reason I chose the Canon S10 over other  similar digital cameras was mainly the size of the camera.  I can easily  fit this camera in my pocket on my way to the great outdoors.<br />While I  am outdoors this camera is very sturdy.  When powered down the lens  retracts and is enclosed away from any harm.<br />Now this is how I use my  camera, usually I take my pictures at the highest quality and when my 48mb  cf card fills up I go through my pictures on the viewfinder and delete the  ones that I don't like so much, and I fire away with my memory free'd up.<br />Back at my computer I upload with the USB connection (must have,  anything else is WAY to slow).  The photo company I print with is  ofoto.com, they are great!  They have software where you can crop your  photos for the desired size, this is great when you take a picture with  something that you didn't originally want in the photo.  Then I upload the  photos and have them printed out and sent to me, what a great service, I  can also send out email with links to the photos albums I wish to share.","The S10 packs a lot of features into a compact form. As a tote-around point-and-shoot, it's a good choice. The retracting lens and automatic cover make it easy to pack, and the ability to take high capacity memory  cards or IBM disk devices allow you to take quite a few pictures (even at  2-megapixel resolution) without downloading.<br />On the downside, the S10  consumes battery power at a higher rate than other digital cameras I've  used, and the specialized batteries are expensive. The rechargeable battery  pack from Canon is helpful, but it's not included with the camera, upping  the cost of a useable configuration.<br />The 2x optical zoom is a bit short,  given that many of the competitors products give you 3x. I often find that  missing magnification requires me to shoot at a higher resultion and crop  the result.<br />Most disappointing is the S10's inabilities to accurately  capture colors in the red-orange range. Flesh tones are often rendered  incorrectly, and flash pictures often end up leaving skin looking pasty. No  amount of adjusting the cameras controls seems to solve the problem.  I've  read reports by others who've suffer the same results, so I'm inclined to  think it's a software problem, rather than an issue with my individual  unit.<br />In addition to the rechargeable battery pack, I'd recommend using  this with a computer that has a USB port (and getting a USB card if your  machine doesn't have one!), as downloading pix, expecially high-resolution  shots, through the serial port is painfully slow.","You really need to get the additional rechargeable battery pack (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004SYN4/ref=/qid=962088005/sr=1-2/102-0974387-3584949) for the S10, which bumps up the total price a bit.<br />For not much more,  you can get the even smaller S100 Digital Elph - check it out:  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004TS16/ref=/qid=962088005/sr=1-4/102-0974387-3584949<br />Other  than that, I think the S10's a great, fun camera.","At almost the last minute before leaving on an Alaskan cruise, I decided to dump my usual point-and-shoot camera and go digital.  Amazon got the camera to me the day before I left - needless to say, I was reading the  manual and taking test photos on the plane to Anchorage!  I found the S10  to be very easy to use, and very difficult to take bad pictures with.  I'm  still discovering new features.  One of my favorites is the ability to  connect the camera to any television set and show your pictures within  seconds of taking them.  We did this several times on the ship.  The  compact size of the S10 makes it more likely that I will carry it with me  on outings, rather than leave it at home.  I've not yet gotten into the  computer/software side of digital photography, but I'll attack that soon -  I just got back from Alaska yesterday.  Three recommendations:  1) you MUST  get the rechargeable battery set, and probably an extra rechargeable  battery.  It's unfortunate that the charger outfit was not included with  the camera (and included in the price).  For this reason, if I had it to do  over again, I would look very closely at the Canon S100.  2)  You should  consider getting a larger capacity compact flashcard - I got a 32Meg, which  holds about 140 snapshot-type pictures. 3)Think about getting a soft case  for the camera - Canon makes a leather case - you can also get nylon cases  that work.  I worry about scratching or otherwise damaging the LCD screen  while carrying the camera unprotected.","The Canon S10 camera is an excellent value at the current price (...). The class of camera has some limitations (only 2x optical zoom), but compared to other cameras in the same price catagory, I rate it at the top. You may also want to consider the Nikon CoolPix 800 which is neck and neck  (although no USB).<br />Some good aspects:<br />1. The image quality is  excellent. See ... a review which rates this as equal to  or better than Nikon digital cameras (even the more expensive ones). Also,  see the image quality for yourself at the online gallery.<br />2. The camera  is very compact and the lens automatically retracts and covers itself (!)  when not in use.<br />3. Autofocus is very good and the camera has a red light  which allows it to focus in the dark. Trying to focus with digital cameras  using a range finder or LCD is difficult if you haven't tried it, so this  is important. I didn't realize this as I am  used to 35mm SLR cameras.  There is also a focus lock which allows some override.<br />4. Red eye  reduction feature, a macro mode and rapid shooting feature.<br />5. Camera  case is metal! Doesn't seem to scratch easily as metal has a mat finish  with some kind of 'kryptonite' coating. This kind of attention to quality  is something that supposedly isn't around any more in consumer products.  Congratulations Canon on refusing to compromise on this (I'm not a 'things  ain't what they used to be' person).<br />Not so good:<br />1. Canon rechargable  kit neccesary - a must buy so figure into the total cost. This kit  apparently comes with the camera outside the U.S.<br />2. Connector for  downloading to the computer has a release button to remove the connector  which hurts my thumb/is difficult to remove. This is not an issue if you  take the CompactFlash memory out and use a cardreader to download your  photos (My particular connector may just be defective).<br />Overall, very  happy with this purchase. Realize that the total price for your setup with  the power kit and extra rechargable battery can be additional ~$... (That  is not to mention the additional cost for all these cameras: more/greater  memory cards)","easy to use and downloading to the PC is a breeze.  I wish the buttons were a bit more intuitive, but overall a strong camera.","I just bought the Canon S10 digital camera and so far it has beenworking great!<br />S10 comes in a 8MB CompactFlash card which can hold up to 12 large pictures (1600 x 1200) and it is compatible with the 340MB card and connects to your computer using a USB port; if you have a Window95 or Windows NT system, don't worry, it also comes with a serial cable though using it would really slow down the actual download speed. S10 is also very compact compared with many other digital cameras, which is an excent choice if you have limited space on vacations. The feature I like most about this digi cam is that it has its own slide show built-in which you can hook up to your television with another cable that is provided in the package. Plus some other feature including Black and White photographs, slow motion, red eye reduction, etc.<br />Here are some of my regrets: 1. The software that is provided with the digi cam is very poorly put together and crashes alot on my Toshiba notebook.<br />2. The CompactFlash that is provided is TOO limited I would buy the 340MB card or buy a couple more of those 8MB cards.<br />3.  S10 uses to much power, you will need to buy the recharger for around $100 because the Canon is so desperite to get more money, or you need to buy a dozen of those batteries at $12 each<br />3. 2x zoom is just not enough, you need at least 5x or greater...","Compre esta camara en Mayo y debo decir que estoy muy contento con el software y con la calidad de las fotos, pero MUY molesto con el hecho de que la camara consume las baterias a una velocidad increible.<br />Es  altamente recomedable que se compre el kit con la bateria recargable, pues  en Mexico las baterias C2R5 son extramadamente caras. Sin embargo, un punto  muy agradable de esta camara, aparte de su magnifica resolucion, es el  hecho de que los lentes Canon en esta camara son asfericos, lo cual elimina  la distorsion que existe en lentes comunes en los extremos de una  fotografia.<br />Con esta camara se pueden tomar 2 o 3 fotos y juntarlas en  una foto panoramica con el software que trae (Adobe PhotoDeluxe 3.5)<br />Si  amas la fotografia esta camara es la indicada, ma sno olvides comprar la  pila recargable.","I just bought one of these S10's.  As a 2 megapixel camera (where thegeneral classes are 1, 2, and 3 megapixels..., respectively at the time of this writing), I've been very happy with my purchase.  My main reasons for choosing this camera were:<br />1. It has a USB connection. Very important for speedy downloads.  Do NOT get a 2mp or greater camera without one.  Warning: Win98/Win2000 are your best bets - NT doesn't support USB and neither does win95.<br />2. It supports CompactFlash Type II.  I like CF better than SmartMedia.  It's cheaper, supports higher capacity cards, and is more durable.<br />3. It supports the IBM MicroDrive 340 CF type II card (which would be a reason to buy this camera over the new digital ELPH S100, which is too small for that drive).  340MB = about 500 pictures for about $300. How huge is that!<br />4. My lower bound was 2 megapixels.  The 3 Meg cameras JUST came out, so the prices on these two megapixel cameras all dropped by about 50% a few months ago.  3 megapixel cameras are still pretty pricey...<br />5. The review on dpreview was very good. Phil Askey explains in great depth the pluses and minuses of these cameras.  I value his opinion a lot and he highly recommended this camera.<br />6. Battery life is reputed to be about 50 shots with regular use of the LCD preview and scanning shots.  That seems about right in my usage so far.<br />7. Extremely compact and rugged, fits in your pants pocket.  Has a sturdy non-plastic tripod mount.<br />Biggest surprises after buying the camera:<br />1. The software that came with the camera is surprisingly good.  Thumbs up.<br />2. The batteries that you use are about $12 a pop, unless you get the rechargeables.  The recharging device is a little under $100 and comes with one battery.  Everyone recommends this as the first accessory followed by purchase of two more rechargeables (for a total of three) at about $35/ea.  With this setup, you can take about 150 pictures - teamed with a 340Mb MicroDrive you can fit the entire vacation on the camera with room to spare!<br />3. I'd like to find a nice protective case for it, but they don't seem to be available :(.<br />4. You can't do the flash upgrade of the camera's firmware without the recharger kit.  Fair warning!<br />5. The 340MB drive had some minor incompatibilities with the camera until the software patch released the first week of May 2000.<br />6. The LCD panel has the best anti-glare of any digital camera I've ever used.  Big FAT SORT.<br />Hope this helps!","The S10 is a fine little camera.  In automatic mode, it quickly snaps 1600x1200 shots with medium level compression.  You can fit about a dozen on the 8MB CompactFlash card that comes with the camera; I get around 55+  on my 32MB card.  These shots are fairly high quality; in good lighting  conditions, I can print them as 4x6 photos and they look at least as good  as my cheapy 35mm camera.<br />You can put the camera in manual mode for  greater control over compression, image size, gain, digital zoom, etc.  This can be useful, but this camera is not targeted towards the person who  wants elaborate details control.  It does contain some easy-to-use  sophisticated features: the panorama stitch mode is extremely easy, and the  black-and-white and other \"special effects\" shot types are also  just a twist of the dial away.<br />What are the weak points?  Well, for one,  it's pretty appalling that the camera doesn't ship with the Canon  rechargable battery.  You will need to purchase that and a recharger right  away (at an additional cost of around $100).  Also, although it isn't  horrible, I would prefer a 3x optical zoom.  2x just doesn't do that much.  Number three, the optical viewfinder doesn't align very tightly with the  actual shot -- you can use the LCD display, but that drains the batteries.  Finally, I was disappointed that there is so little tactile feedback when  you snap a picture.  I'm wary about having a stranger take my photo with  this camera because I fear they won't realize when they've taken the  shot!<br />I've found that having a digital camera fundamentally changes they  way I take photographs.  I'm much more likely to snap 3 or 4 shots of a  particular view and then immediately scan over them and pick the best 1 (or  2) and discard the others.  This was a lot of fun and I think it improved  the overall quality of photos that I take.  (Of course, I could just try to  become a better photographer...)  The Canon S10 is easy to use and carry  around, and I'm happy that I purchased it."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-F505","amazon_reviews":["We have used this at our design firm for three years, and it has been flawless.  Amazing pictures, great features, excellent usability in terms of downloading from the memory stick.

An excellent camera.","As a former pro-photogrpher and now web/graphics developer, I had heard the usual negative comments about digital cameras.

Other reviews here reflect those concerns: \"It's a great camera, but no optical viewfinder?\"  Yes, I thought so myself at first.  But consider the following:  The lens rotates vertically 180 degrees on the camera body allowing the photographer to hold the camera directly overhead - or anywhere down below - yet still see the LCD pefectly.  The advantage?  Complete mastery of that universally dogging fact of photo-life, PERSPECTIVE - the single most important factor in any good photograph's composition.  To my knowledge, the F505 is the very first hand-held camera in the history of photography to accomplish this.  So whatever is lost by the lack of a viewfinder is compensated ten thousand times by this magnificent fact.  Further, when I took my first photo (indoor with flash), my jaw dropped to the floor.  I could read the cover notes on CD cases across the room.  Color?  Absolutely precise.  Frankly, I had never seen anything quite like it.  The new version - the F505v - adds the TIFF format for pros, which places this camera precisely at the pinnacle of its class.  Drawbacks?  There is a slightly noticeable lack of extremely tiny detail in certain type of outdoor images.  And, as with all digital cameras, dynamic range could be improved.

It has all the right bells and whistles: 1600x1200 max resolution @ 2.1 megapixels, a nice Zeiss zoom  lens, UDB port connection to offload images. The included memory stick is a  little small but Sony sells memory sticks as large as 64 meg, which will  hold 110 images at the camera's best quality, and 200+ images at  \"average\" quality. A couple of memory sticks and an extra battery  make a good kit to travel with. I recently spent a week in Paris and London  and took 700 pictures, offloading them each night to a laptop. I was  thoroughly impressed with the way the camera works and the photos it  produced.","Bought this in Japan while on a trip through Asia.  Unbelievable quality pictures!  One of the best features is the ability to take pictures which are saved in two resolutions, high res plus a smaller format for emailing.  The memory stick technology is very cool.  It comes with a 4MB stick, but  you can get up to 64MB -- I highly recommend getting a 32MB or 64MB,  especially if you use the dual resolution mode.  Downloading is a snap with  USB connection to the camera, plugging into your pc's serial port, or my  personal favorite, purchase the optional pcmcia card into which you can  plug the memory stick -- similar to using USB.  Takes terrific pictures,  and the video mode is pretty cool, too.  5-10-15 seconds of mpeg video  which you can output directly to tape, or download and edit.","I just received the Sony DSC-F505 this past week, and I must say that I absolutely love this camera.  The picture quality is excellent, and it supports resolutions up to 1600 x 1200.  The image sizes range from approximately 100KB/picture at 640x480 up to approximately 400KB/picture at  1600x1200.  The majority of the photos I have taken have been approximately  200KB/picture at 1024x768.  As a result of the relatively large image  sizes, I highly recommend using the USB interface to the camera.  Image  transfers from the Memory Stick are much faster via USB as compared to a  serial connection.  You can also capture MPEG video at resolutions of  160x112 and 320x240.  The unit takes a little getting used to in terms of  holding it comfortably while taking pictures or shooting video, but other  than that it is nearly perfect.  I would highly recommend looking into this  camera.","Picture quality is excellent and USB connection is just lightning fast. It can take about 100 fine pictures with 32MB memory stick."]},{"name":"Kodak DC290","amazon_reviews":["This is the second DC290 I have owned, my original over fifteen years old is starting to wear out the lens frequently hanging up during extension and retraction.

We also use the companies camera, which has varied from Olympus to this years Cannon G2. Despite having half the pixels, the 290 has outdone all other cameras used in clarity and color. Just point and shoot and a great picture results. You don't need a 5 megapixel camera when you can do crisp 8x10, superior color photos with this camera.","I researched digicams for 4 months before I made my decision to purchase a dc290. It has a wide range of options...jpeg compression, ease of adding audio, clarity of the optical zoom, bursts and video mode, etc. It takes outstanding quality pictures and it's the only camera which has upgradable drivers. By using a card reader, 84 pictures can be uploaded from a 16mg card in a matter of seconds. It does go thru batteries quickly if using the LCD as a view finder. I gave a dc290 to my daughter for Christmas 2001 who lives 1,200 miles away. It is a pleasure to receive pictures from this camera regardless if it's an event, landscape or my 1st grandchild. It's almost like watching my grandson eat his first cookie, beginning crawl or capturing an awesome expression in person.","I actually bought my Kodak DC290 last year, but I figured I would write a small review of my experience with it.<br />I am completely satisfied with the quality of the pictures this camera takes.  I also purchased an 80 Megabyte Compact Flash card when I got the camera, therefore expanding my possibilities.<br />The thing I am not happy with is the rate at which the camera eats through batteries.  I literally cannot enable the 2inch LCD for more than 5 minutes on a NEW SET of batteries, before it is warning me of Low Batteries.  Even without the LCD on, the camera will only last (maybe) an hour.  I don't know if this is a faulty characteristic of the Camera in general, or JUST MY camera, but it is quite costly when you add in all the batteries I go through in any given time that I use my camera.  It is also Frustrating to have to CONSTANTLY worry about the battery power on my camera.  I ALWAYS have to bring 2 sets of batteries with me if I plan on using the camera for any events where I plan on taking pictures, etc.<br />Anyhow, I figured I would put this word out for everyone to see, so if they see it multiple times.. it may be a consistent problem that would prevent you from wanting this particular model.<br />Good luck, and happy hunting!<br />Mike J<br />...","Besides good quality pic, i dropped this camera on concrete 3 time from my backpack and got water into my camera 2 times during my canoeing trips. back home, i used hairdrier to dry it. and it still works fine till now. own it for 3 years. No prob.  What else can is say? the most solid camera i have ever seen. no doubt.","The DC290 is an exceptionally great value for the features that it offers.  This camera is highly customizable and has the ability to \"learn\" through scripting.  It allows you to save pictures in different web friendly formats and at different resolutions and quality's.  Even at \"standard\" settings you recieve excellent quality pictures.  With a 64 meg card (comes with 16) at HIGH JPEG quality you can easily take around 100 pictures.  The ability to save as uncompressed TIFF gives you enormous results and is great for use with PHOTOSHOP or other programs.  This is a must have for anyone looking for a mid-range priced camera that operates like higher priced cameras.","I have had my Kodak DC290 for two years now. I have taken pictures from Alaska to Florida and have never been as thrilled with a camera as I have been with the DC290.  The pictures that it takes are beautiful.  I have printed out my pictures on plain printer paper as well as high gloss Kodak Photo paper.  When I print out on Good, its almost as sharp as Best.  Friends are amazed at the pictures.  My Daughter liked it so well, that she bought the same camera and can't say enough about it.","This is my third digital camera. I started with a Kodak 1.1 mpix, then to a Polaroid 1.3. I began to read reviews about the DC 290 from several pros and casual users. All reviews were five star as to use, programing, and dependability.<br />I like the size of the camera and the easy menu. The good, better, and best settings are easy and the 2.1 resolution (compressed) pics are of high quality on better, but the lower res work well when sending pics by e-mail. The TIFF (uncompressed) delivers great 8 by 10s on my HP PhotoSmart 1115CV printer. All buttons, ports, switches, etc. are top dollar. One complaint is the flexable cover over the LCD, I would rather it were glass for easy cleaning (Scotch Tape does the cleaning job however)! Also the fash can wash out pics indoors so I use a shoe with my SLR flash. Also I use PhotoShop and MS PictureIt to work with my pics.<br />This will be a camera I will not sell even though it does not do video. I use a Camedia 3040 at work and the vid is not that great. The DC 290 does allow for audio (15 sec) on pics, and the programming feature is great (I just downloaded a bracketing feature). I got the camera for $225.00 through a Amazon.com source. The box had been opened but never used as all batteries and materials wer still in their bags and wrapping. If you can find one, this is a terrific but. Its bullet proof and not too bad on batteries (I have two sets of NIMH and the charger that comes with the system). Five Star for me!!!","This is my first digital camera.  It takes good pictures and is very user friendly.  Beware that it's a very slow camera, and the zoom lens is not that great.  It's an OK camera...I guess for the price, it's not a bad deal.  If you're planning to take action shots or lots of indoor shots, I would not recommend this camera.  It takes a good 5-10 seconds to turn the camera on and off.  By the time you turn the camera on, you've missed the shot.  Same thing with the shutter speed.  If you try and take a picture of a soccer game in action, you better anticipate the shot.  The menu system is great, the transfer of the picuters works flawlessly and it takes good pictures in outdoor lighting.  The flash on the unit is very concentrated and causes shadows behind objects.","This was my first digital camera. It's a great buy now and there are terrific used prices as well. It's a 2.3 megapixel camera that generates a 3.3 interpolated picture or 2240 by 1500 on ultra resolution! That's not far from the 4.1 megapixel cameras out there today and a lot cheaper!<br />Pictures are clear, crisp and can be cropped nicely without losing clarity. Colors are vibrant and 20 meg flash card can hold 28 pictures at best resolution before having to download. More if you use lower resolution. This camera can generate 8x10 prints that are sharp and colorful. The included photo editing software is basic but there is so much on the market today you can supplement for little money.<br />Built in flash works very well indoors and does a very nice job filling in shadows outdoors.<br />Anyone can get quality results from this camera. It gives you professional output without the professional price.","This is a fantastic camera.  There are so many great features about owning a digital camera, especially this one.  For starters, the picture quality is perfect!  There is no pixles to be seen at all, and the color is brilliant.  It produces picture that is far superior than ones from regular film cameras.  To have it printed, use Ofoto.com (owned by Kodak).  It's just $.49 per picture for 4X6 pictures to be printed.  Don't think about printing them on your home printer, because you won't get nearly as good of quality, and secondly it would actually be more expensive to print at home once you factor in the cost of a good printer, cost of the color ink, and the cost of the paper.<br />More great features about this digital camera are the ability to connect it to your television.  This is a great idea, especially for parties.  Instead of passing around pictures, you can easily hook up your camera with the cable included in the package to your tv, the same way you connect your vcr.  Your images will be on your tv so everyone can enjoy them together.<br />Next, the ability to fix your pictures is a huge plus.  You can take out all the stuff that got in your shot, so it's just what you want.  No more having someone you don't know on the side of your picture.  Also, you can dramatically change the lighting.  If it was cloudy, the computer software (included) will fix it so your picture is easier to see.  The computer software can do so much more too.  I just made a collage of pictures from a recent vacation.  There are 9 pictures in one, which makes it kind of look like a postcard.<br />This camera is FANTASTIC and you should seriously consider getting one.  If not this one, then at least replace your old camera with a digitial camera.  They are not hard to use at all, in fact, I think are even easier to use.  Go digital, you won't regret it!!","Great camera comes with the worst user manual I've ever seen (except for the one Apple includes with it's iMac ( there is none...really).  After a couple of months, I am still trying to figure out how to download shots that include thumbnails with the photo numbers to my iMac HD.  It does not seem to have the ability to upload digital pictures to Photoworks in Seattle for storage and custom prints.<br />For the price, it should whistle a tune for you while your reading the user manual.  When you want to look something up, you get only half the information and are told to turn to 2 or 3 other pages for information, rather than just telling you the whole story in one place.","I use this camera for work, and I use it quite frequently.  This is a very good camera, but not quite perfect.  It has a lot of nice features that are standard on digital cameras these days, a nice LCD screen that eats the batteries away at an alarming rate, and is nicely contoured to hold.  The picture quality is excellent for my line of work, which requires 4 x 6 photos, the resolution is excellent, and the colors are great (as far as I can tell, anyway).  My favorite quality about this camera is the ease of loading the pictures on to the computer.  Just plug it in, it loads the program, and you pick your folder and the pictures are transferred.<br />There are some negatives about this model, too.  One is the size; it is a bit large compared to other, smaller models.  This may or may not be a problem for many people, but I prefer a smaller camera.  The other is the power button; you have to hold it down for an undisclosed amount of time to get it to go on/shut off.  These are not big complaints, but the camera could have been better.  Kodak's customer service has been top notch.","I am use to a 35mm SLR, but wanted digital.  I decided the 290 was the best balance of features and price.  I think the camera is great and already have several wonderful pictures. Great quality optics. It is very easy to use.  I love the way the cap pops off automatically to take a picture. I do not understand why it also pops off automatically when it is attached to the computer in connect mode.<br />The driver that came with the camera for USB connection is very buggy.  It caused my computer OS (98SE) to go unstable.  I have had many GPF and lockups since installing the software that have never happened before.  The Windows would also not shut down.  The Kodak site has new drivers to fix the shut down problem, but installing them after the previous installation was very difficult.  I had to load and remove the original software three times to get the new drivers to load.  Both my image editing software packages get GPF errors on certain pictures.  That is something I have never seen before in using either editor for over two years.","I've had this camera for about a month now. It's a replacement for a Kodak DC120 that I had for several years and finally died after a very hard life.  The pictures from the DC120 were good for a digital camera at its time but not as clear as I would have liked.  Pictures from my wife's high-end Kodak Advantix camera were clearer.<br />The DC290 pictures look as clear as the Advantix.  The color is great and the ability to reach into dark areas and get the detail is better than the DC120.  I recently tried it for some back-lite photos at a wedding reception and it did great.<br />Disadvantages are ones normal to digital cameras: fairly long cycle time between photos, poor battery life and limited space on the supplied flash card.  The view-finder is in a funny location, but if you use your right eye you won't smudge the LCD display.  My son-law-recently bought a Canon PowerShot S300 Digital ELPH for my daughter and we were comparing the two cameras.  I think the Kodak creates better pictures, uses standard batteries and costs less right now.  The Canon is smaller and has better lens protection.  For pure pictures good with the Kodak.  If size is important go with something like the Canon.<br />The DC290 is last years model (Kodak lists as discontinued at their web site) which is why the price is so good.","You will hear consistently that this camera is slow, and to some degree this is true, however, it takes awesome pictures! I've begun to print mine out (even 8x10's) and this camera is just great. With the new price reduction, pick one up. You won't be sorry.","I've used this camera for a while now.  Pictures are good quality, and with the price of compactflash comming down it's a good deal.  My only gripe is the compactflash slot is very fragile.  If you switch cards a lot it may break.  In such a case you'll have to send kodak your camera, and they will send you a refurb back.<br />I frankly was disapointed that my month old camera in great condition was replaced with a refurb that was obviously much older with obvious signs of wear and tear, plus a couple dead pixels on the display.  All of which are considered \"okay\" by Kodak.  I really felt like I paid a new camera price for a used camera.","There is no question about the picture quality the machine delivers. Up to 8X10, it is impressive. You can even have more than 8x10 if your picture does not include finely-detailed subjects such as human face.<br />Other than impressive picture quality, the machine performs pretty good in low-light conditions. Flash has a very good range, which allows you to have bright and vivid pictures at home.<br />The lcd size is large enough to review the photos. The machine comes with enough software and cables to review the photos on TV and computer, and the hookup for both is pretty simple.<br />However, it does not let you take any picture for 15-20 seconds after you shot several pictures. The flash light keeps blinking and you can not take any picture. I am not sure this is a problem with my own machine, but it should not wait that longer.<br />If you buy this machine, I would suggest you to buy an additional 64 or 128MB memory, especially if you go outdoors and take tens of high quality shots.","A great camera at any price!  This is my first digital camera however, I have used other's that my friends have.  I purchased this camera after having both SLR and point and click camera's.  The quality and color produced by this camera are outstanding.  The camera is also very easy to use and change settings.<br />Opt for an additional memory card and the additional lense kit.  The lens kit if used properly, increases the your picture taking abilities.<br />Another great feature is the built in mic.  We took a picture of the kids singing a Christmas song and sent it off to my parent's just before Christmas.  They really enjoyed it.<br />I've read about the camera being a battery hog or having corrupted memory cards.  I've had the camera five months and have not experienced any problems.  I do keep an extra set of batteries with me at all times just in case.....","I've shot about 3000 pictures in nine months, mostly in Africa being bounced around, and the DC290 has done well, as did its DC265 predecessor.  The add-on telephoto isn't worth it, and the DC265 required repairs after being dropped 18 inches on its lens barrel.  But excellent pictures. If you keep the LCD shut down and turn off the flash via the boot-up scripts, the battery life is pretty good, sometimes 100-200 pictures.<br />It's a little big for suitcoat pockets, OK for most jacket pockets.  My wish list would include a 200mm-equivalent telephoto and elimination of the buffer-emptying 20-30sec pause when you shoot four 1800x1200 pictures in rapid succession.","I have tried a few others, but nothing can compare in clarity or color accuracy to my 290.  Most other digis produce pictures that have that 'soft' focus look - go ahead - look at them.  They're not really in focus.  the pictures from my 290 allow me to see the nit on the nut of a gnat - yes it's true.  Set it for the closest setting - about a foot.  WOW - what detail.  You can see the dirt in the pours on the skin - yuck.<br />The 2nd best feature is the time lapse up to 16 seconds.  I got a terrific lightning strke - which is something you need to leave the camera 'open' while you wait.  I love shooting light trails in the darkness of any sort.  This one is the best.<br />The giant uncompressed TIFF format allows you to save details you will only see on a jumbo 10 by 14 print - now who wants a picture that big anyway?  The colors are beautiful and devistatingly accurite.  You'll be going to the mirror with your glasses off to see if IT is really true.<br />Most places allow you a 30 day return without questions - do it - indulge yourself.  You won't be returning this one.  It's the BEST.  Let the rest of them just - eat cake.","This is a wonderful camera.  Kodak digitals have the best color reproduction of all of the digital cameras, and the clarity is comparable with the best. I did my research before buying this and would not consider anything but a Kodak, Olympus or Nikon.  The rest pale by comparison.  This camera has several features which are hard to find on other cameras in its class.  One is the burst mode, which allows you to take several pictures in sequence at up to 3 frames per second.  Another great feature is the external flash sync.  Very few digis have it and it is indispensable if you want to take professional photos. The feature I really love though, being a programmer, is the ability to program scripts for the camera - to me that is what digital cameras have over their analog counterparts, the flexibility and programmability.  Even if you aren't a computer nerd like me, you can enjoy this feature because there are several free scripts available written by programmers.  This feature alone puts this camera head and shoulders above others in its class.","Besides the great design, the DC290 features 2.1 megapixels and 3X zoom (5X digital). I've never seen a camera with so much features for that price, including an infrared port, USB connection, audio & video output (you can see your pics on the TV), a great operating system (very easy and very flexible) and a very good LCD monitor.<br />I've taken the camera to lots of places, is everything but fragile, the rechargable batteries (included) lasts for about 60 pictures in best resolution.<br />You can update the operating system via internet so you can add new features to the camera, also you can download and create scripts for speacial functions, like picture bracketing.<br />Very recommended!","The DC290 has proven to be everything I could have asked for in a digital camera. With all of the options that this camera comes with, coupled with excellent photo quality the DC290 can fill the void from recreational to professional use. Kodak has covered all the details right down to the convenient and very logical use of AA batteries for a power source.","The quality of the photographs taken by this camera is wonderful, and it's easy to use. HOWEVER...for me, it did not work with Windows 2000 even after downloading Kodak's most up-to-date drivers. The good news: Kodak's service department is terrific, and they shipped me a Kodak USB card reader--free and overnight! All is hunky-dory with the camera now, and all in all I'm quite pleased with my purchase.","I have used many digital cameras in my career as a web designer, including ones from Sony, Olympus, and Cannon. By far, the Kodak DC290 has the best image quality. Even on the lowest quality setting, pictures come out excellent. This means that you can store about 140 decent pictures on the included 16MB card. The DC290 also has the best color reproduction I have seen. Even without any touching up from Photoshop, I was able to print out samples that my friends couldn't tell were taken by a digital camera.<br />The DC290 can also take great shots at night and in other low-light environments. I once had to take pictures from a nighttime football game. The DC290 delivered. The pictures were clear and surprisingly bright.<br />The camera is also very simple to use. Transferring files to the computer is easy and fast to do with the USB cable.<br />The price tag is a little high, but if photo quality is most important, the DC290 will not let you down.","This is the camera used at Disney World by the staff members to take pictures of the guests. It is a excellent camera.","This is my first digital camera, and i must say the image quality is truly excellent. I have taken over 200 photos with this camera in day & night conditions. I am a web site designer, and have found the camera excellent for this purpose. Web images don't need much more than about 80dpi, so this camera is more than good enough. The quality and colour of flash images and low-light images is very good with the 290. In particular i have found that flesh colour reproduction is excellent.<br />I have had no complaints about battery life. I do not use the LCD screen much  because of warnings from other users about the battery drain this causes. The shutter delay is noticeable, but if you pre-focus (by half depressing the shutter) it's not too bad.<br />I have had no trouble with uploading to my W98 PC via a USB port. Usually about 5 sec for a high quality image. I use photoshop to edit the images, but find surprisingly, that most of the images are prety good in terms of exposure, colour, hue and contrast.<br />The only problem i experienced was that the battery charger supplied by Kodak blew up after about 2 weeks, but Kodak Australia replaced it fairly quickly.<br />I only gave this camera 4 stars because of the price. It cost me over $1200 Aus which is about $600 US. I could buy an F series Nikon for that.<br />Still, I am growing to love this camera.","After much review, the dc290 won me over at nearly $500 less than the Nikon 990 (the only comparable competition).  The reviews I read were exact... 1. Excellent photo color and clarity. 2. Fast USB download. 3. Slow menu interface 4. Digital display drains the 4 AA batteries FAST (< 1hr), but  you can use the manual view finder to conserve power. 5. Great photo editing software from Adobe (it's not photoshop,  but it's easy to use and has a lot of automatic features).","I bought the DC290 and instantly started taking great pictures right out of the box.  Don't listen to people who say the lag time is long after you press the shutter button.  you must first hold the button down half way just like all cameras and when the green light illuminates press the button all the way the picture fires right away.  you do however have to wait a little between shots.  But I think the picture quality is worth the wait.  I did find the camera to be a little big.  So I bought a FUJI 4700/zoom.  It arrived yesterday.  let me tell you the DC290 blows the FUji out of the water.  Yes the FUJI takes quick time movies and the camera is very small but the picture quality sucks and so does the battery life.  I am returning it today. Out of all the Dig Cams I have tested the DC290 is the best.  I have not tryed the DC4800 yet. If you want a great camera thats very very very easy to use buy the DC290. IT ROCKSSSSSSSS","This was for me an upgrade from the Kodak DC210, and I have been greatly pleased with the quality of the images and the general versatility of the camera.<br />If there is a downside, it is perhaps too much versatility in the menu system: too many useless options, such as creating an \"album\" on the flash card; \"watermark\", date and time. Another useless feature is the ability to record audio messages.  Like the \"Album\" feature, who needs it?<br />Four rechargeable AAA batteries plus a charger are included as well as a 16MB flash card and a USB connecting cable.<br />The good features include optional manual setting of distance and exposure time; daylight, fluorescent or tungsten light. Thus it functions as both a point-and-shoot, and also as a camera for the more advance user.","I purchased this camera in May 2000 and have been using it ever since. First off, this camera takes EXCELLENT pictures. I usually have to do some Photoshop-ing on most other images that I either scan in or bring in off a camera. With this camera, very little, if any of that is necessary. Here's the breakdown:<br />- My camera came with 20MB of memory. That is enough to take ~40 pictures at the second to highest quality level. Well within acceptable limits considering that if you run out of pictures, you can just transfer them to a computer and re-format the card.<br />- The interface is a little touchy if editing on the camera. I prefer to edit all the settings by communicating directly with the camera.<br />- Transferring the images off of the camera directly was a problem for me. Sometimes the software wouldn't work (under Windows 2000). I haven't used it with Windows 98. I haven't heard too many similar complaints so I assume other people aren't having this problem. However, I bought a Compaq flash card reader (USB) and it works fine.<br />- Again, image quality is superb.<br />- I've seen some people complain about the delay the camera experiences when taking a snap. I found this not to be exactly true. If I hold the button down until the green light comes on (indicating that everything is ready) and then I depress the button all the way, the camera takes a snap right away. However, if I just depress the button all the way initially, it does take a few seconds for the picture to be taken<br />- Battery life. The camera takes 4-AA batteries. The camera lasts for probably a little more than an hour as long as you don't use the preview mode (sucks up charge like you wouldn't believe). The package doesn't come with an AC adapter (*SMACK* Kodak). You have to buy it separately. All considered though. I can take a good number of pics before I have to recharge. Just make sure to bring an extra set of batteries with you.<br />I highly recommend this camera even to enthusiasts. You probably won't be disappointed.","Overall, I am very happy with this selection.  The kodak lense insures top quality photos.  I think the detail of the pictures is superb.  Also, even though there are a lot of bells and whistles, they are easy to learn and use.  It is small and light weight, so it's easy to carry around.  The only bad point, in my opinion, is the delay time between snapping the picture and the camera actually taking the picture.  I've read this is a feature with all digital cameras.  Very annoying.  Often, a good picture is gone by the time the camera takes the shot. As with all digital cameras, the batteries drain very quickly.  Also annoying.  However, if you are taking indoor shots, there is an AC adapter which you can attach to the camera and plug into a wall.  The power is then not supplied by battery but an electrical outlet.  I'm looking for that to buy.  Then you can continously take pictures and keep the LCD supply on to your hearts content.","I read many reviews for the DC 290 before I purchased it.  I am VERY pleased with my purchase.  I have found it to be a very easy camera to use and all the buttons are right at your fingertips.  Since I have purchased this camera I have yet to go back to my 35 mm camera.  What made me purchase this camera over others was the megapixels, memory card (mine came with a 32 mb card!), audio record, flash range, and it came with rechargeable and non rechargeable batteries so that I could play with my new toy as soon as I took it out the box.  The quality of the pictures is unreal!  I just love it! My husband is also happy because now he can stop shopping for that camera to make me happy.  I found everything I need and want in a camera from my DC290.  Great job Kodak!","The camera is fantastic.  The viewfinder is key.  Few other manufacturers include this important feature, although the LCD screen has huge limitations.  An LCD screen is useless in sunlight, and using an LCD screen drinks battery power like water.  Kodak avoids that by giving the user the viewfinder option.  I never use the LCD with this camera except to delete photos to make room for more on the memory card.  Photo quality is excellent, the camera is easy to use, and it is sturdy.  I only wish the zoom was better, but I don't think any other digital camera offers much of a zoom.  Buy the multi-lens kit for this camera - the telephoto and wide angle lenses expand the camera's function.  Great camera...I recommend it for anyone.","Sharp pictures. Amazing low-light capability. BEWARE of the software drivers : DO NOT LOAD them on WIN95 - my machine got totally hosed. Avoid loading them on NT - service pack 6 kept 'blue screening' on me.<br />AVOID the DC290 1.2 software they ship. Go to their web-site and download version 1.3 which is stabler.<br />Technical Support is awesome - there is absolutely no wait period and reps are very helpful.","I bought my DC280 a year ago and have been happy every since. The camera has excellent color capabilities, I can create photo quality prints using even lower quality printers, and I can utilize my picture both on and offline. I have taken my camera from the Grand Canyon to New York and from family Christmas parties to 50th birthday celibrations. This camera rocks. One year and 1000 pictures later I can't wait to shoot the next 1000.","I've had this camera for a few months now, and I love it.  The colors are great, the resolution is great, and it really doesn't seem to go through the batteries like I thought it would.<br />The only reservation I have, is that the 16Mb compactflash that came with the camera, and the 64Mb (Kodak brand) compactflash card I purchased to go along with it have had some problems caused by the camera.  When the camera is connected to my Win98 PC via USB, the camera properties would work fine, but the flash card would not appear as a drive letter.  When using the other flash card, it would appear correctly.  I called Kodak, and they told me that my flash card had become corrupted, and needed to be formatted.  To make it worse, it could not be formatted in my camera, it had to be formatted in a card reader device.  Well, I used the Digita File to transfer the images from the card I could not read from, to the one I could, and got all the pictures off the cards.  After that, I used the camera's format command on the misbehaving card.  After that I could read from both cards again.  Since then, both cards started misbehaving and could not be read into my PC.  Well, I was forced to purchase a card reader (I got the SanDisk SDDR-31 one).  Well I got all the pictures off, and formatted the cards.  I don't expect any more problems, but I would reccommend buyers of this camera (maybe it is all digital cameras, I've only owned this one) do one of the following:<br />1. Make sure you change the batteries as soon as they start getting low.  If you have taken quite a few pictures in rapid succession and the batteries run low enough to cause the camera to shut off, you will corrupt your card.  Also make sure you never remove a card while that light underneath the lever is blinking.<br />2. Purchase a card reader (Mine cost $30)","I owned a DC260 and upgraded to the DC290 for the extra resolution. In the year that I have had it, the DC290 has been a great camera. I am a Civil Engineer and use it to document construction projects. Being able to view the picture immediately after shooting allows you to retake the picture until it is acceptable. I transfer the photo files to my portable PC by just plugging in the card to an adapter in the PC card slot. The PC sees it as another hard drive. At the end of the project, I copy the pictures to a CD and give it to the client as a record of the project progress. The files are in standard JPG format, so you only need a web browser to view them. The DC290 also does uncompressed TIF for ultra high resolution.","In some ways, the DC290 beats some of Kodaks more recent offerings. I read a lot of positive reviews earlier this year on the DC290, but what finally convinced me was this: I live near a Marine Base, and they evaluated a large variety of cameras from many manufacturers and selected the DC290. After several months of use, the Marines I spoke to rave about it! When I finally purchased one from Amazon, I wasn't disappointed. The image quality is very good & is easy to use. The infamous one second shutter delay reported by past reviewers are operating it improperly. Hold the shutter release halfway (yes, Kodak designed it so you can feel it), and wait until the viewfinder light comes on. Depress it the rest of the way when you really want the picture taken. Other cameras operate the same way, usually to charge the flash, and any photographer should spend the second to compose a snapshot before taking it anyway. There is no delay after the viewfinder light comes on.All the positive comments from other reviewers apply. Additionally, this camera uses standard \"AA\" NiMH cells which are common and inexpensive compared to proprietary battery packs that are expensive and difficult to find. Most people underate the importance of a common battery type until they travel & the battery fails! The only negative comment is that the DC290, as well as most digital cameras sold today, uses expensive flash memeory. I purchased additional Memory (96MB Sandisk from Amazon) because the included 16MB card is inadaquate, especially when taking uncompressed TIFF images- only 2! Mathmatically speaking, a 2.1 megapixal camera like the DC290 is capable of printing 35mm photo quality 4x6 prints at 300dpi, using 6MB of compact flash memory. Spending the extra money for a 3 megapixal camera doesn't make sense for me, as these cameras hog even more memory! I wish this camera was compatible with IBM's microdisk, which recently released a 1GB drive. A much more economical [solution] is Iomega's new external 250MB USB Zip drive, the FotoShow, which downloads images directly from flashmemory card to Zip disk without needing a bulky computer, a real boon for travelers! This drive will work with any camera using compact or smartdisc memory. This is so new, Amazon doesn't sell this yet! One last point: the software included with the DC290 works for WIN98, not WINME. You need to go to Kodak's website to download the latest software which is WINME compatible. I gave this camera a 5 star rating. With FotoShow, I would give it 6 stars, if it were possible!","I love my DC290. The photos are really fantastic - believe everything  you've heard about the color quality this camera produces - rich, rich,  rich.<br />Also beleive everything you've heard about battery consumption. As  others say - be smart and avoid the LCD. You'll still get a quick  \"preview\" after each photo is taken without burning up the  batteries by using the LCD as a viewfinder.<br />If you're hemming and hawing  about going digital - just do it. No regrets here.<br />One other word of  advice - save your photos in non-pdd or non-pds format for use with EZ  Photo software. I wasted a few hours trying to get the slideshow and  screensaver features to work - this is the trick. Check out the Adobe tech  support archives and search under \"EZ Photo\" if you need more  info - very helpful.<br />Enjoy!!","After much research, I finally decided to buy the DC290 as my first digital camera.  The picture quality is great.  Kodak seems to get the best reviews when it comes to photographic fundamentals; that's the selling  point of this camera - the quality of the pictures is great.  The color  depth of these pictures is phenomenal, and under any lighting condition.<br />You can get over 25 pictures on the 16MB card on the high quality  setting, as good as a roll of film - or much more on the standard quality  setting.<br />The USB transfer is fast and easy, I don't think a card reader  is necessary, so long as you've got the AC adapter(not included) to  conserve battery life.  The camera appears as a drive on your PC.<br />The  only major drawback of this camera plagues all digital cams from what I've  read - battery life.  It's really poor.  I killed the first set in only a  couple hours with minimal LCD screen use and this wasn't continuous use.  Even if you're conserving battery life by all means possible you'll need a  backup set of rechargables, or 2 or 3 backup sets.<br />Also, for [the price] they should've thrown in the AC adapter and maybe even a case.","I really like this camera!  I am getting much better results (more natural and vivid colors) with my digital camera as compared to scanning 4x6  photographs--there is no need to worry about color adjustments!<br />I  researched many cameras before deciding to buy. This one seemed to be the  best quality for the price.  The two main enhancements in this camera v.s.  the DC280 are the support for uncompressed pictures and the ability to  record audio annotations to accompany the pictures. These two features  swayed me to the DC290.  In all honesty, I find that I am not even using  these features.  The uncompressed format takes up way too much memory (you  would need to buy 128mb storage card to get around 16 uncompressed pictures  at the highest resolution). I have found that the best quality jpeg  compression produces fine quality (I can print great-looking 8x10s) and I  can fit 10 times more pictures on the memory card.<br />The DC290 also has  slightly better max resolution (1,792 x 1,200 v.s. 1,760 x 1,168).  The  DC290 also supports a 2,240 x 1,500 resolution that is accomplished using  interpolation, but this probably won't produce any different results then  enlarging a 1,792 x 1,200 image using PhotoShop or some other software.<br />I  have found that battery life isn't a problem (as some suggest) if you use  NI-MH rechargeable batteries. They seem to have a much better life than  alkaline batteries (rechargeable or not). I also limit my use of the  display, which is not difficult since I tend to prefer using the  viewfinder. This *significantly* reduces battery usage.  The only draw back  is that you can't use the digital zoom without the display.  This is also  not a problem for me because the optical zoom has been sufficient for my  usage. Also, digital zooming in general tends to produce poor quality  pictures, although I can't personally attest to quality of Kodak's digital  zooming.<br />The one problem I have with this camera is the delay between the  time when the button is pressed and the time when the picture is taken.  It's a least a second or two, which makes taking action photos very  difficult--it's hit or miss with the timing.  I tried to use the burst  feature, but I found that to have limited usefulness. I was use to using  the completely manual, tried and true, Pentex K-1000 SLR. Without being  overburdened by a lot of electronics, there was very little latency. I  suppose going to any automatic camera, digital or not, could produce the  same frustration.<br />All-in-all, I love this camera. It takes great quality,  high resolution pictures. However, I would also look at the DC280 as a less  expensive alternative.","The DC290 is great for photos in which you get to pose your subject, but for action shots it should be avoided. The amount of time that passes from when the shutter release is pushed, and the time that the camera actually takes the picture seems like an eternity. I'm sure its only 2-3 seconds, but I've missed out on a few moments because of that time lapse. Would I suggest my friends buy this camera? Yes, and I have. But if you are buying it to cover sporting events, you should look for something with a shorter \"think-time.\" (my terminology for the shutter lag)<br />***Update 7/21/01 I've owned this now for over a year. I've really come to love it. When I bought this camera it was a couple hundred dollars more than what it is now, but I decided it was going to get treated like any other camera that I have owned. Which means I've done everything except try to pound nails into wood with it. I bought a 128mb CF card to go with it- a must in my opinion. I wanted to upgrade to the Kodak DC4800, but that was a mistake. The DC4800 is a mess compared to the DC290. (the only thing good about the DC4800 was the software upgrade. My computer used to take about 15 minutes to shutdown, now it takes seconds. If you buy the DC290 get the latest software and drivers from Kodak) If you already own the DC290 and are thinking about taking Kodak up on there trade-in towards a DC4800, don't do it. The DC4800 has so many dead pixels that color rendering is atrocious, it's also so cheaply put together that I would be scared to treat it the way I do my DC290 . The DC290 may be oddly shaped and heavy, but its a sturdy workhorse.","After many hours of research, I decided the Kodak DC290 was the best camera for me in this price range (below $1000). After receiving it and  having it for less than 1 hour my research was validated. Set up is as a  breeze, the instructions were clear and precise. Picture quality was  amazing, and I haven't even used the highest settings yet. The camera feels  good in your hands and the fact that Kodak includes rechargable batteries  in the box is nice as like all digital cameras this one uses up batteries  pretty quick. However I have to say if you manage you picture taking by not  using the view finder/display they last pretty well.  Along with the camera  I also purchase the Viking smart card reader.  This is a must, the set up  and initial use was a breeze on my Mac G4. The speed of transfer is  amazing.","We use this camera at a manufacturing facility for all our documentation.  A picture is worth a thousand words and this camera is worth the price.  It  is easy to use, comfortable, and easy to download to a PC.  It is also very  durable.  Many people use this camera and it has gone through some abuse in  an industrial environment.  The pictures have real nice color details and  sharpness.<br />The software that comes with it isn't the greatest.  I  recommend Photosuite III or MS Home Publishing to get the most out of your  digital pictures.<br />Extra memory is also a must have.  Invest in a 32 or 64  mb memory card and you can take pictures all day.","I have owned digital cameras for 3 or 4 years now and the Kodak DC290 is the best, overall, I have owned/used.  At work I have occasion to use a SONY MVC-FD95, SONY MVC-FD91 and the Kodak DC290 camera; and while the zoom  capability of the either SONY is better, the Kodak DC290 produces a picture  quality that just can't be beat!  The colors come out so true and crisp it  is hard to believe they were taken with a digital camera.  I print the  pictures out on a HP 952C printer and I use Kodak photo paper (not because  it is better than the HP paper but rather the local Office Depot has it on  sale more often).  The photos are indistinguishable from 35mm prints up to  5 X 7 but I have not printed any larger yet.<br />The camera \"feels\" good  and is easy to hold.  The controls are all well placed.  The .5 to 1 second  lag between the time you push the shutter release and the time the picture  is actually taken, does take some getting used to.  This is a bad feature  on all digital cameras I have used.  It takes about 2 to 4 seconds to  \"process\" the picture but this time is a function of how fast your Compact  Flash memory card is as well as the camera itself.<br />I appreciate the  \"scripts\" that can be downloaded from various websites into the DC290.  These allow you to \"change\" the functionality of the camera or add features  such as auto-bracketing, or putting your name and phone number on the  startup screen.  I also purchased the Kodak lens kit for the camera.  I  have played with the various lenses but have not done anything serious with  them.  My main observation is that the wide-angle lens seems to cause a  noticeable loss of contrast on the final print.  The 2X lens works fine as  do the close-up lenses.  And, I purchased a couple of extra sets of  rechargeable batteries, mostly for convenience rather than necessity.  While the camera is a noted battery hog, I can take 45 to 60 flash  pictures, displaying each shot on the LCD for 5 seconds before the  batteries give out.  It's nothing to change the batteries.<br />The 16 MB  card that comes with the DC290 is adequate to get you going.  Sooner or  later, though, you will want to get a second memory card that probably has  a larger capacity.  You get about 25 high res, best quality pictures or in  standard resolution and good compression, about 250 pictures on a 16 MB  Compact Flash card.  If you download any scripts to the camera, they take  up room (not much) also.  Downloading from the camera is fast if you use  the USB connection.  That eats batteries also and Kodak suggests you AC  power the camera while doing this.  I, instead, opted for a Compact Flash  card reader.  It cost about $35 and is so much more convenient.  You just  pop the Compact Flash card out of the camera and into the reader and it  shows up as a hard drive on your system.  You just access the pictures as  you would any other file.  Each high Res, best quality picture (about 550K)  takes about 1 to 1.5 seconds to download.  I did not try the standard  serial port connection.<br />The LCD viewer is wonderful indoors or outside  out of bright light but is all but useless in sunlight.  This is a drawback  because using menus visible through the LCD viewer sets most of the camera  settings.  However, some of the more common settings are viewable and  changable from an LCD on the top of the camera but nothing fancy is  adjustable without using the main color LCD viewer.<br />Overall, I highly  recommend the camera.  I used one at work first for several weeks and still  decided to purchase one for myself.","I've had much fun with this camera. Very user friendly menus, great features, durable.  My only wishes for this camera is to have a better zoom feature and longer battery life.","The DC290 has exceeded my expectations in image and color quality. Truly outstanding pictures!  Yes, it did eat my akaline batteries in under an hour (most digital cameras do that), but the rechargables shipped with the camera are doing well. I bought to more sets! I'll probably get the AC  adapter but I use a card reader so I'll wait and see. It would be wise to  buy a larger flash card. I bought 32mb and have the 16mb that came with the  camera as well. I was pleasantly surprised that the serial cable was packed  (as well as a usb cable) so I can use it with any WIN 95 machine.<br />I found  the camera a snap to operate out of the box. The menu is user friendly and  easy to operate. I don't use the display much to conserve battery power.  However,it is useful for close range shooting.<br />Another great feature is  the external flash mode. I've used it successfully. The scripts that can be  downloaded (free) making the capabilties of this camera a great buy.<br />I  upgraded from a Kodak DC50 which also gave me great service. This camera is  a truly great value in the tradition of the Kodak Company. ...","I was very very pleased with all aspects of this camera.  Its my first digital camera and the picture quality is extremly impressive there are so many features for the money.  It was a little more than i had originally  intended to spend but now im glad i did.  The USB connection is a must,  this camera has both a USB and a serial connection,  downloads using the  serial connection are ungodly slow compared to the USB i wouldnt even  consider buying a camera without a USB connection.  I also purchased the  optional AC adapter i now feel that it was not really required the  rechargable batteries...well ive been taking pics and downloading for 2  weeks now and still on the 1st charge...of course I dont use the LCD very  much. just buy an extra set of rechargables and forget the AC adapter. I  really cant say enough good things about this camera...its a great choice.","I'm just an amateur photographer but in the past 25 years I've owned three 35mm SLR cameras and two auto-everything 35mm cameras.  The Kodak DC290 is my first digital and it operates about the same as the auto-everything  cameras.  It can't do everything that an SLR and a gadget bag full of  accessories can do and it doesn't have the \"feel\" of an SLR.  But, it does 99% of what I want and produces beautiful photos.  I've had  mine for about four months and have taken almost 1000 photos with it.  Last  week I went to the USAF Museum and took over 300 photos, about 100 of them  with it on a tripod using shutter speeds of 0.5 to 3.0 seconds.  Fantastic  quality.  I bought an extra compact flash card (64M) and two extra sets of  NiMH batteries and took along my old notebook PC.  When the picture cards  were full, I transferred the photos to the notebook PC using a PCMCIA  adapter then erased the card.  That worked fine and I have not had any  problems transferring files to my home PC using the USB port either.<br />When  you consider that we were spending over $200 per year on film and  developing anyway, going digital just made sense.  I like the ergonomics of  the camera and the menus are easy to use - just spend a few minutes with  the manual.  I was switching between a variety of modes at the museum to  get the best photos possible and it wasn't that difficult.  I haven't had  this much fun since I bought my first SLR.  Coworkers were amazed by an  8x10 portrait of my wife that I took with the DC290 and printed on photo  quality paper.  Kodak provides support through their web page including OS  upgrades to the camera's software.<br />Recommendations:  Get a case and one  or two extra sets of NiMH batteries.  I haven't bought the AC adapter for  it but I can see how it would be useful to some because it takes about 8  hours to recharge the batteries.  The batteries will last longer if you use  the viewfinder instead of the LCD.  The LCD is essential for close up shots  and the digital zoom only works with the LCD.  A large compact flash card  is a good idea if you intend to use the best quality at high resolution  since the picture size in that format are usually around 500K.  The  graphics software that comes with the camera is OK but better programs are  available for any serious photo editing you might want to do.","I think this camera is wonderful!  Dispite some small shortcomings (short battery life, and difficulty in setting up to communicate with computer) it is a great camera. It is as close to a film camera as I have seen. If you  have a good printer (Mine is a HP970Cse) and use Photo Paper, you will not  be disappointed!","As I knew nothing about digital cameras, I did quite an exhaustive investigation covering the middle tier of available cameras up to $1000 - and thankfully I came to the right conclusion!  This camera is fantastic -  especially for those who want to take pics and work with them on their PC.<br />The ease of use for this camera and the results you can get are worth  the price alone.  But to be able to manipulate the files from your keyboard  directly on the camera is ingenous.  I, too, took pictures within all kinds  of lighting conditions (including one of a full moon at night) and was  never disappointed.<br />To reiterate a point another reviewer made, it is a  little disconcerting that you must buy an AC adapter separately - but  that's the only real criticism by this non-professional user.","Kodak DC290 is fine for medium/long range subjects.  However, because the viewfinder and the lens are off-center, you invariably get off-center results - unless you use the LCD as your main viewfinder (this eats battery  life and the display resolution makes it hard to make critical shot  decisions).  However, the image quality is quite excellent for most  outdoor/lighted conditions.<br />The interaction and placement of the  controls are quite good. There are a few key rubber finger and grip  affordances to make the shooter feel in control.  The only cheap part is  the zoom lever.  It's a small horizontal lever, that has to be kicked way  over to one side or the other, and the time delay to lens movement is  sluggish.  The overall construction of the entire body and finish is very  nice. There's plenty of standard features like burst, time-lapse, etc. to  keep most digital camera enthusiasts happy.  A real nice package bonus was  the 4, AA NiMH rechargeable batteries and charger + 16MB storage card.  At  least Kodak was thinking about the entire user experience.<br />Oh, the PC  software interface is rather silly.  The childlike icons and metaphors for  album creation, etc. makes you create a parallel cognitive hierarchy model  for what is essentially folders/files on your computer.  Something more  straight forward with clear icons and interface is all we want.  Use the  quick access download near the clock once you've installed the software.","Although I have only a friend's Olympus 2500L to compare to, and although I've never used any other digital camera before, after lots of research I bought the DC290 for my husband's artwork.  I love it.  Great quality.  I  didn't use the 16MB card it came with yet; I needed more space so I bought  a 64MB card with the camera.  Fantastic images with the 'High' setting.  Battery eater, but aren't they all? Very easy to use, if you're new at it.  I really like the Review/Magnify mode. I haven't even touched the surface  regarding features.  I'm searching for better photo-editing software  though...I'm not impressed with the Adobe bundle, but it's free so worth a  try.  The viewfinder is a little oddly placed, but easy to adapt to. I  definitely recommend the camera.","The DC290 is probably the best consumer digital camera in the market, and I'm sure it's the best one in this price range. The camera delivers very high quality pictures and you can make impressive 8x10 prints. As with most  digital cameras, the DC290 is a big energy consumer. Unfortunately, present  day battery technology is growing only linearly as opposed to the  exponential growth in portable electronics. Thus, the battery life for the  DC290 is rather short. Maybe you might want to consider buying an extra set  of rechargable batteries. Also, since the uncompressed size of pictures is  proportional to the number of pixels the camera can capture, a 2.1  megapixel camera like the DC290 can have uncompressed pictures of the order  of megabytes (6.6mb to be precise)... thus, a large flash card is a must  and you will be seriously inconvenienced if you don't have enough flash  card storage.","I have had the Fuji 1700, Sony FD91, & FD88, let me say that those are paper weights now. This camera changes everything about digital photography. It surely raises the bar. I have a web site with many pictures  on it. Some sudjestions: buy the best rechargeables (I bought sony and they  last a long time), before you email them reduse the size, high res pics are  very large (500k-6.6meg) This camera can do low light something my other  camera's couldn't do. What else can I say. Oh, buy the AC adapter too, it's  usefull.","I have a DC265 and the DC290 is awesome!  My wife bought me the DC290 for X-mas.. (Yes I have a wife that would do that..) and I can't put the darn thing down.  The picture quality is stunning in comparison to the DC265 and  I love the uncompressed mode.  I have a lens kit and did some +17 close-ups  with uncompressed max resolution and the picture is unreal.. I have a  HP4500N Color Laser printer (yes I'm spoiled) and it prints 8x10's that  look like photographs when they come off this printer.. The DC265 can print  maybe 5x3.5\" or so before the picture degrades.  And uncompressed  image in the DC290 at 8\"x10\" is very beautiful.  It's hard to see  any pixelation at all.  Also it captures a lot more detail color and light  than the DC265.  I took a shot out doors at night and was able to lighten  it in PaintShop Pro and was amazed to find all these hidden details that  the DC265 would have lost.. I'm in love.. Now if I could only afford the  DC660 (Price of a medium sized car!)  Oh.. Buy a really big flash card, the  uncompressed images are 6.6MB!  So on a 32Mb card you only get a couple  snaps and you're done.. I swear that the camera shoots FASTER in  uncompressed mode.. If you have the money to buy a high-speed 160Mb Compact  Flash go for it..","This camera replaces my Sony MVC-FD88 digital camera. There is no comparison. The DC290 takes true photographic qualitiy pictures. I tried the camera in a variety of difficult lighting situations. It took perfect pictures every time! The software interface is great. It makes the camera  look like another drive letter in your computer. When the camera is plugged  into the computer (USB port), the drive letter appears in windows explorer.  You can then simply navigate and use the standard cut and paste tools to  move the files. I am extremely impressed with the qualitiy of the pictures,  ease of use, and clear instruction manuals. The camera does eat the  batteries. It comes with a set of disposable (so you can use the new camera  while the others are charging) and rechargeable with charger. I purchased a  second set of rechargeable batteries. I simply charge one set while the  other is in use.","I picked the dc290 for USB, compact flash storage, and zoom range. The image quality didn't hurt, of course. I'm very pleased with the interface and picture quality so far. Haven't tried printing anything yet,  though.<br />I wish Kodak had Windows2000 drivers out already; also, the  2\" LCD display shows 'Battery Low' when the top B&W LCD shows  battery full. I've learned to ignore the 2\" display's warnings.","I've had my DC-290 about 2 weeks &have taken about 150 pictures.My main reason for buying the 290 was to get the longer zoom range and to print shots 8x10 and larger.Detail in 8x10 prints almost equal 35mm when  shot at the best setting. Have shot several at the uncompressed setting and  printed to 11x17 with an Epson stylus photo EX printer. Detail is very  good. Color is outstanding. Had a DC-200 before and didn't find the detail  good enough for even 4x6 prints. Once the instruction book is read,the  camera is very easy to operate.The camera is a bit heavy to hold but I like  the feel.The camera is expensive but if you are serious about digital,you  will find it worth the money.I'm from Rochester,N.Y.but I don't work for  Kodak.","The DC290 is a remarkable camera. I've been using mine in addition to my DC265, and the difference in image quality is amazing! Any amateur or professional looking to purchase a digital camera should seriously consider  this model. It's price is slightly high for many, but the quality is worth  it. In addition, make sure you are equipped with a decent color printer.  The prints on my Kyocera Color Laser are phenomenal, as well as those on my  HP DeskJet 870C. Great camera! Great features!","I have been using the Kodak DC290 for about 2 weeks and have been very satisfied by the images I am getting.  I have had a lot of experience with 35mm cameras and have been waiting for the technology to improve before  venturing into the digital arena.  The camera takes stunning photographs  which can be hard to distinguish from actual 35mm photographs.  You can  easily make 8 by 10 prints which are photo quality.  Once you buy this  camera you will probably also want to upgrade your printer.  I have a HP  Deskjet 722C and I think that the printer limits the quality of my final  prints.  The camera appears to be well-made and is very easy to operate.  Everything is intuitive and I mastered it in a couple of hours.  Be  prepared to buy a couple sets of NIMH batteries because the alkaline  batteries that came with the camera only lasted a couple of hours.  The  NIMH batteries last much longer.  The only negative that I can determine is  that the camera is a little slow in releasing the shutter once the button  is pushed.  For anyone trying to take pictures of fast moving children,  this can cause you to miss the shot."]},{"name":"Kodak DC215","amazon_reviews":["I got this camera second hand from my boyfriend after he bought a new one, and though I like the easy to use laid back atmosphere of it, I wouldn't recommend this camera.

Now I have to hold it together with tape.","I've owned a DC215 since January 2000 and I've taken 6950 pics with it so far.

The review feature and preferences menu on the camera is very nicely layed out, and you can easily view and delete pictures as you please.<br />Overall this camera definetly gives you your money's worth.. however, if you're looking to take more than vacation and family pictures to stash away in your [on-line] album, I'd strongly suggest looking at other cameras.  While its good for beginners and the casual user, the Kodac DC215 Zoom leaves much to be desired.","The camera is decent for the price. What I really don't like is the battery juice just gets sucked out. I constantly have to recharge my batteries and it's really a pain. Plus, the battery holder broke. Now I have to hold it together with tape.","I've owned a DC215 since January 2000 and I've taken 6950 pics with it so far.  Ninety-five percent of these pics were taken with the smaller 640X480 size because the larger size is too big for my laptop screen and the quality is too poor.  I've printed out less than 20 pictures (as I prefer to keep them in digital format anyway).  Here is what I think:<br />Pros:<br />* picture quality at 640X480 is very good; better than most cameras of its time<br />* with a 10MB card you can take 114 such pictures<br />* adapts to changing light levels very well<br />* comes with Adobe PhotoDeluxe<br />Cons:<br />* after about 1000 pics the zoomed-out shots started looking really out of focus; today I rarely take a picture while zoomed-out and I consider the zoom feature next to useless<br />* it uses 2.0 amperes of juice!  To conserve batteries I had to turn off the LCD feature, making that nearly useless too<br />* The close-up feature is totally useless because of how much juice it drains (unless you have an AC adapter)<br />* to save as jpeg in Adobe PhotoDeluxe requires 7 clicks of the mouse and 30 seconds of time (multiply that hundreds of times and you get a frustrated user)<br />* sometimes the camera acts like it has a mind of its own, turning on and off whenever it wants (but this is rare)<br />* the camera programmers decided that the date/time has to be re-entered whenever the camera loses it, this can be really frustrating if you're trying to avoid using the LCD screen to save batteries<br />* the lens cap wore out after a year and it no longer fits the lens, making it useless<br />* the battery holder is still intact, but just barely","This was my first digital. I would not recommend this for a person above the beginner level. I re-placed this with a next level DC3800(I did not have big budget).<br />Pros:<br />· Good for a starter<br />· Very good close up shots<br />· Ease of handling<br />· Good zoom<br />· Video out (with good options)<br />· All cables in box<br />Cons:<br />· Heavy (due to 4 batteries)<br />· Slow data Transfer  (serial)","The best personal digital camera for the money.  Kodak should have never discontinued this camera.  I've used it in the construction industry and the military prior to that.  It's been rained on, snowed on, in the desert and in the mountains.  I've tried other Kodak's but this is the one for me.  Keep the prices low, pretty soon I'll have 5 of them.  Thanks!","This model, no longer in production, is an excellent starter camera for those interested in seeing what digital photography is about.  I have taken many pictures with mine with very nice results.  I do alot of 35mm photography too, and bought this as a \"carry along\" for snap shots and it's been exactly what I wanted.  Battery life isn't good so I would strongly suggest getting some rechargeable batteries...they last much longer.<br />I've had no other complaints...","Yes, i really have thought this camera has been great for the two years I have owned it...until my battery compartment wont stay in the camera any more after the tiny plastic clip holding it in has snapped!","For a 1.3megapixel camera, I've been very pleased with the picture quality of this camera.  At 4x6 the pictures are very good (detail & color).  At 5x7 some pixelization begins to become apparent.  At 8x10 pixelization is very apparent on most pics.  If you're taking pics with little detail (portraits and flowers and such) 8x10s are acceptable when viewed from a few feet away.  The built in flash does a real nice job.  NiMH batteries are a must.  I also find that the brand and capacity of the batteries varies greatly and will give you from minutes to a few hours of serious use.  I find that Rayovac 1600mah batteries give me the best service.  Of course using the built in LCD screen greatly reduces battery life.  I recommend carrying a spare set (4).  An upgraded compact flash card is also a must.  At the best resolution I get 56 images on my 16M card.  I find the JPEG format easy do deal with in most photo application programs.  The only drawback is the serial interface cable.  It takes a long time to transfer a large number of images to the Computer.  While I haven't yet purchased one, a USB compactflash reader would probably be a good idea.  The camera is very easy to use and the menu options are very intuitive.  (I've never read the manual past a brief lookover.)  I recommend this camera to beginners and intermediate users who want pretty good results at a low price.","I have used my Kodak DC215 camera for two years and have been very pleased with the quaility of the photographs (though some indoor lighting causes small white \"orbs\" to show up in the photographs).  BUT, not too long after I bought it, the tiny plastic clip that keeps the battery holder in the camera broke without me even knowing it--that's how small/weak it was.  I solved the problem with a bit of duct tape and bought an adaptor to avoid using batteries when I don't have to.  The camera has worked great for taking close-up digital photos of old family photos.","I got this camera two years ago Christmas. I love the camera, it is really easy to use and the clarity of the pictures is wonderful. I use it to take pictures of my 18 month old who is constantly on the go and I never have to worry about fuzzy pictures. To those who complain of the download time, I would suggest investing in a flashcard reader, they run [pretty low]after a rebate. It is well worth the investment, it takes all of 2 secs to download 50 pictures. I would definitely recommend this camera.","Like many consumers, I spent a lot of time reading review after review on all kinds of digital cameras and finally decided on the Kodak DC 215 for several reasons:  great color balance (vs. Olympus' pastel toned images), ease of operation (vs. the overly complicated Olympus and Canon LED menus) and conservative battery consumption. And heeding other DC215 owners, I also purchased the Kodak AC adapter and two sets of rechargeable NicadMH batteries.  Even without the use of a flashcard reader, it takes about 20 seconds per shot to upload onto one's computer with a transfer setting of 57,600 cps.  As for any negative comments, I would highly recommend masking around the eyepiece (especially the sharp corners) with plastic tape (electrical tape is just fine) since the frame's corners can easily scratch ones eye glasses.  Overall, the Kodak DC 215 should be rated a \"Best Buy!\"","I took this camera to school and really enjoyed taking alot of pictures without having to pay developing costs.  The best feature of this camera is its ability to capture colors so well.  All well lit pictures are vibrant and clean.  I only have a few problems with the camera that you might consider before buying.  First, the casing is easily dented, as I found out when I accedentlly knocked it against a dresser.  It still works perfectly, just has a small dent.  The camera is also kind of bulky and not too easily gripped.  Normally I use a HP Photosmart printer wich has a card reader in it to retrive my pictures and this works quite well, but the serial connection is very slow and not much fun.  I am about to buy a laptop and I am discovering many do not have serial ports.  This will make it hard for me to retrive pictures while on vacation, I will probably buy a usb to serial adapter.  All in all this camera is still a good buy, and I am reccomending for such a great price.","I recently bought a kodak dc215 for my son but have found myself using it more and more it only cost £125 from a company called staples in the uk. I worked as a proffessional photographer for a number of years in the eighties and early nineties and when digital photography first became available experimented a little but the quality was so bad then and the price so prohibitive I never chose to buy one. but the quality of this simple point and shoot camera is astounding and for such a small price the only criticism I would have is the sheer volume of batteries needed to feed it and the software that comes with it could be better (but it is still highly usable.) I realise that the quality of the printer has a lot to do with the final product but I do believe that the image quality has to be there in the first place to achieve such good results. If anyone is looking to buy a simple camera at a reasonable price I would recommend this product unreservedly.","Got this camera about 10 months ago and it passed my test -- my wife uses it and doesn't complain about it being too hard.  In fact, except for the occaisional disposable, we don't own, and probably won't own, another camera until we replace this with another digital.<br />This is definitely for the \"Instamatic\" crowd.  Point and shoot, fixed focus, etc.  Everything is made really simple, without getting too technical.<br />I love being able to put them up on the web quickly, and email to friends quickly.<br />Negatives: (Hey, everyone want's to know what I don't like first.) 1.  Delay after taking the picture.  This is the only real complaint I have.  It doesn't seem like it would be that bad, but if you want to take several shots of something in a row, you have to wait.  Kinda kills the moment. 2.  Batteries.  This was a complaint until I started buying NiMH batteries.  DON'T try it with NiCads -- just doesn't work.  And you might want to have some \"emergency\" Lithiums around too (though they are so expensive, I don't do that normally). 3.  I went for the gold, so I got an 8MB card, and it was too small.  So, I just bought a 16 MB card.  I rarely get it full, and if I do, I dig out the 8MB for the rest.  Or, I just get rid of the lousy pictures.  4.  Software -- since I never plug my camera in directly, I was dismayed that the software keeps complaining that I didn't plug in the camera.  So, I just copy all pics onto the hard disk and look at them with the default Microsoft picture viewer.  If need be, I clean them up with PhotoDraw 2000 (which is a total pain -- don't think you're getting anything if you get it).  We get by.  Some means to keep notes for each picture would be great.<br />There are probably some things I'd look for in my next camera, but all in all I'm pretty happy.","I bought this camera last year (2000) for use at work to take pictures of product defects for quality improvement. Our buildings are dark and the products are dark grey. Using the flash, different angles and the software to enhance the photos, I found this camera to be great. Granted, the downloading is a bit slow, but hey, at work I'm getting paid! After over a year, this camera is still working great. No complaints: I'm no artiste, but I know how to use a camera. If you do too, buy it.","The only thing that I can say about this camera that isn't positive is the downloading speed through the serial connection.  This camera takes great quality pictures, is easy to use, a comfortable size, and is a bargain compared to its peers.  The optical zoom is the best feature because most cameras in its class only have digital zoom.  The editing software included is not the best, but that should not stop anyone from buying this camera.","I wound up buying the DC215 while on holiday, after losing our old 35mm camera.  At the time, I thought I was getting a bargain at around 220UKP, but have since seen the camera back in the UK for the same price.  I wasn't aware that you could get such a well featured digital camera for this kind of money.<br />The camera has a versatile range of flash settings, including 'fill in flash', 'red eye reduction' and 'no flash.'  The 'exposure compensation' feature is very useful in poorly lit conditions, when the flash would be inappropriate or useless.  The camera also features a 10 second self-timer and a macro facility.<br />The biggest shock is battery consumption - in fact, if you use disposable alkaline batteries in the DC215, you'll probably find that the cost per picture is higher than buying and developing 35mm film!  A decent collection of NiMh rechargables is an essential accessory, but there's no need to buy the Kodak brand ones.  I wound up buying a couple of sets of Uniross 1300mAh NiMh batteries, which work very well.  There's no reason why you can't use NiCd batteries if you already have them, but if you're buying especially for the camera, then the NiMh batteries are well worth the extra cost.<br />The features which I found annoying (most of which have already been mentioned) include the capacity of the standard memory card (4Mb) the slow download speed via the serial cable, the limited capabilities of the 2x optical zoom, and the fact that the 'zoom' facility in 'review' mode does not allow you to zoom in far enough to check the detail of the picture (which is supposedly the whole point of the facility.)<br />In review mode, the camera shows the pictures in two stages - a low resolution (and very blocky) image is shown instantly when a picture is selected and, if the picture is left on-screen for a short time, this is overwritten by the high-resolution version.  Unfortunately, the camera also operates in this way when viewing the pictures through the video out connector - so each picture in the 'slide show' is first shown in blocky low-res, and then updated to full resolution after a short delay.<br />The camera features a conventional viewfinder, which is normally adequate for framing up pictures.  It is also possible to switch on the LCD for a real-time view of the picture to be taken, although this is best avoided if possible as it severely drains the batteries.<br />Output quality is very good, provided that you set the resolution to high.  For each resolution, there are three possible quality settings, which affect the amount of JPEG compression applied to the picture files.  For the technically minded, 'Best' mode generates JPEGs with a quality setting of 94% - 'Better' and 'Good' use 85% and 75% respectively.  Even at 3x magnification (on the PC screen) it is difficult to see the difference between the 'Best' and 'Better' settings, and for normal (1x) viewing, the differences between the three qualities are unnoticeable.  A 16Mb card will store roughly 65 'Best', 90 'Better', and 135 'Good' pictures in high resolution mode.  The camera displays an estimate of the number of pictures remaining on the card (based on current compression and resolution settings) although this figure tends to be on the conservative side.<br />One bonus of the design is that the serial and video connections use standard jack plugs, and the leads are simply straight-through cables.  I have already made two spare serial leads, so I can download the camera at home, at work, or on the move (into my notebook PC) without having to remember to bring the cable with me.<br />All in all, it's not the perfect camera, but it's not far off - the only things really missing from my 'wish list' are a more powerful optical zoom, a USB port, and a better 'detail' viewer in 'review' mode.  For 220UKP, I'm not complaining!","I am a television news anchor.  This camera was recommended to me by a photographer for National Geographic, who was a guest on my show.  Since I bought it, I've not taken a single picture with my old 35mm camera.  The color quality the DC215 offers is amazing!  People can't believe the pictures I show them were taken with a digital camera.  And for the price, you can't beat this deal.  One of the best purchases I've ever made!","Bought the digital camera a month ago and i was disappointed with some of the features.  1st problem with this camera is the poor result when you take a landscape pictures or any distant photos.  The image was fuzy and the pixel was large enough to be seen on the photos. Second problem with this camera ...tend to trip the alarm sensor at the airport and stores...extermely annoying when you travel.<br />i agree the price is great, but it is worth what i pay for.","One problem I came across: Many times, not always, after I press the Shutter button, the LCD shows the picture with the delete icon, I believe unless I want to delete it, I should just wait for the camera to keep this picture and be ready for the next one. However, the LCD goes off. I have to press the \"do it\" button to bring back the LCD preview to be ready for the next one. (My batteries are charged). Is this normal? Need to ask Kodak. Meanwhile, if you know the answer, email to jeng2000@ureach.com","If this camera keeps doing what it has done so far, I will be extremely pleased with it...  I wanted an inexpensive digital camera to make pictures to be viewed on a computer screen. Never plan to ever print any of the pics on paper.  It does a SUPER job if you hold it steady and if you get the lighting just right. I especially like the color display on the back of the camera that shows the EXACT composition of the picture that you are going to get. The close-up capability (8 inches away from the subject) is important to me, too.<br />You need to have realistic expectations about the electric power consumed and the limitations of the serial interface as well. It can use up four good batteries in an afternoon if you keep doing things with it that take a lot of power, and the images take a few seconds to transfer to your computer. You should consider an A/C Power Supply and/or rechargable batteries if your will be using it a lot.","This little camera is a great performer.  The pictures are very sharp for it's one megapixel rating.  I have a 1200 X 1200dpi printer-I purchased a photo cartridge and I am amazed at the prints I am getting.  This camera recommends 5 X 7 enlargements for the best and highest resolution setting, but if you crop or save a picture with the Kodak Pictures Now Software (included with the camera) you can save it at the best and professional setting, and you will get some great prints-even 8 X 10.<br />I think the color is dead on for outdoor shots.  I bought the lens adapter from Kodak that allows for 37mm screw on filters;  have UV, Polarizer, ND6, ND9, & FLD for flourescent light-if needed. But Kodak has a great lens coating on their lens; my indulgence in the extra filters was lagnaippe for me-many shots (most all) need no filter at all.<br />Kodak Pictures Now software is very good, enabling you to crop, set brightness or contrast, and has templates for printing single or multiple shots on a page, or different shots on a single sheet at a variety of different sizes to save paper. If you get the Kodak card reader the software with that is very good also, enabling you to do a bit more-you can even touch up those laugh lines (look ten years younger!) along with more detailed editing, and it offers templates for editing and printing as necessary.  I have Photoshop, and although it is useful, it can be time consuming and somewhat mind-boggling.  The software provided with the camera is good; the one with the cardreader gives you a little more to work with, and both are fast and easy to use.<br />An important feature for me is the wide-angle lens (29mm-48mm Zoom) for landscape photography.  It is THE widest lens I have found (except for the Kodak 4800 digital-28mm) for a camera of this type and price-range.  Also, you can control exposure + or -2 stops in half step increments. It has a self-timer & video in/out to view on tv.  It is easy to program, installed easy on my computer.  You can store what seems like a zillion photos at the best & highest setting on a CD rom.  I also got 2 sets of NiMh rechargeable batteries and rechargers-always keep my extra set in my camera case.  I bought 2 extra 16mb picture cards; I can get over 50 pictures on one card at the best settings.<br />To wrap this up, if you want to explore digital, (I've had my Canon F-1 for 23 years) but are skeptical because you are used to high-end 35mm SLR or larger format, this camera is a great one to start with.  Do not let the ISO, aperture, and shutter speed ranges fool you or stop you.  You can even take great night pictures-a favorite of mine-get the tripod-with a little available light. If you are an artist who wants a camera for reference material, look no further-this is the one. It is amazing what this little camera can do!  Kodak hit the jackpot, so did I!","I wanted a digital camera but I didn't want to spend a fortune, and I wanted one that would take good quality pictures. I set my upper limit at $300 for the camera and began shopping. I looked at everything from $39 to $500. I spent hours on the internet reviewing cameras. I also scanned the Sunday sale ads waiting for the right camera and price to come together. It did. I bought a Kodak DC215 for $299. Included with the camera was a SanDisk card reader. I was ready to take pictures.<br />I shot a few pics the first day and uploaded them to the internet. How easy! Over the first few days I took more pics and continued to upload to my album. I also set it up where anyone could view the pictures and/or order prints. My family, 600 miles away, can only call once in a while and say hello, but can enjoy the pictures on the internet whenever they wish.<br />After uploading about 50 pictures I decided to order prints online. I'd heard so much about \"resolution\" and \"recommended print size\" that I was scared that I'd get very grainy prints in the mail. What I received (using the lowest resolution on the camera for the prints) were wonderful, glossy, 4x6 prints. Every bit as good or even better than from 35mm film. I was amazed at the quality.<br />I later purchased a 32MB card for about $70. It holds up to about 485 pictures. I'll use this card when we're on vacation.<br />I couldn't be happier if I'd spent $999 on this camera. The only drawback - it takes only snapshots. If you want telephoto or wide angle, etc, get a good 35mm and use film. For digital this camera can't be beat. I love it. It's EVERYTHING I set out to acquire at a very, very reasonable price.","just got my dc, love it!! i've tried several different brands, $2oo to$800 ones, for the money this is by far the best deal. color great, easy to operate, kodak quality.i got a  card reader, takes to long downloading from camera.","I got this Camera about 2 months ago and I have been loving it everytime I use it!  The picture quality is great and it is very easy to use for people getting started with digital cameras.  The only thing I have to complain about it that the software that downloads the pics is very slow.  I use the good ole \"Paint\" program which makes things much more easy!","This is a fine little digital camera for beginners or casual users. It looks good, has great balance in the hand, and offers enough features to make it fairly versatile. Aside from the recreational user, it might be an ideal camera for someone like a real estate broker who wants to have something handy in the glove compartment, but doesn't want to worry about a very expensive piece of equipment getting lost or stolen. The camera is not perfect, but it is a good buy. PROS: 1) Appearance, weight & balance. 2) Highly readable (and adjustable!) LCD display. 3) AAA batteries readily available...(2 sets of rechargeable would be great). 4) Optical (2x) zoom. 5) Switchable resolution settings:  a) 640 x 480 perfect for emails & websites.  b) 1,152 x 864 good enough for 5\" x 7\" prints. 6) Very good software package. 7) Kodak service & warranty. 8) Readily available CompactFlash memory cards. 9) Faster recovery btwn shots than most digicams. 10)Useful & handy lens cap.<br />CONS: 1) Fixed focus lens (like old 110 cameras). 2) Limited (2x) zoom. 3) No USB connection to download shots to PC (this will make the purchase of a separate memory card reader a must). 4) Need for battery charger & rechargeables (to be practical).","I purchased this camera about a year ago.  After 11 months of constant use (alomst 4000 shots) the pictures started getting really fuzzy with a few spots.  I called KODAK and they issued an RMA and I shipped it back to Kodak.  Less than a week later, I had my camera back.  They replaced the lens, the case and several other internals.  Good as new.  No \"the warranty doesn't cover that\" BS.<br />The camera is an excellnt buy (the price has come down ... since I bought mine) and Kodak customer service was a pleasure to work with.<br />Highly recommended....","I use the Kodak DC-215 exclusively for eBay Auction listings.. I have received MANY emails asking what Camera I use and complimenting me on the clarity and color of my photos... I have never used the Camera for any other purpose but for digital images loaded into my computer, it is OUTSTANDING... I plan to purchase another Kodak DC-215 as a 'Back-up'. (Just in case)..","Being a top of the line 35mm camera user, I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and the photo quality of the DC215.  The pictures were of exceptional quality and the 8 x 10 prints were much better than most of the digital pictures I took with a high end Olympus digital camera.  This camera is sturdier than most digitals I have seen to date.  I only had a slight problem with the tonal quality of the some blues and purples, but this is easily corrected with most photo software.  I do recommend the PF card reader though to be able to easily access your photos.  The Gold version of this camera does include the card reader in the package.","I am new to the digital image realm. Having scoped many different cameras, I have found this DC215 to be a great user friendly peripheral. If you know how to use a regular 35mm camera, this is no different. Picture quality is terrific. I use a HP 812 deskjet to print all my 4X7 prints. One item to keep in mind. Not necessary this particular camera, but with all, I suggest you purchase a compact flash card reader. This makes transfering all your images to your desktop in a snap. The cable provided with the camera is simply useless. If the DC215 interests you, Kodak has a package called Digital Camera Expansion Pack that comes with (4) AA rechargable batteries, compact flash card reader (serial connection), PCMCIA adapter, and a 8MB compact flash card for less than $100. Bottom line in shopping for a digital camera. If money is not an issue, hell go with the Top of the Line model. In the other hand, if you are me with limited spenting funds, make sure you look for a camera that has batteries which can be recharge.  Purchase a camera that comes with at least 4MB of memory.",".....the machine will only work with a serial port on your computer.  We had just bought a new Compaq notebook computer and I figured this camera was a perfect Xmas present for Jill.  Woe is me!  No serial port on the Compaq.  Now I'm scrambling for all the stuff it takes to hook the thing up.  Probabl solution: a new color printer with a slot to insert the memory card, thereby bypassing the computer entirely.<br />In summary: check your port first.","Bought the camera last weekend and we are so happy with it.  I am really impressed with the quality of the pictures. Even pictures taken in 640X480 low res. look great on the computer.<br />The settings are very easy to change and the internal software is very user friendly.  I showed it to my 80 year old grandmother and she was snapping pictures in no time.  She even figured out how to delete the one's she did not like.<br />If you are looking for a simple, no extra B.S. digital camera this is the one for you.","This camera is a very good deal. I got it today, and I like it very much. The quality of the pictures it takes is very good. Doesn't have a lot of features, but this is what is expected from a <$300 camera. Comparing it to HP C200, which is of the same price, this one definitely wins. 2X Optical zoom, and picture quality is much better. The only problem is that the Flash Memory Card is kind of small only 4 mb","I bought this camera for my personal use and I'm very pleased with it. I  took several pictures of my car to show off to my friends, they were  amazed, thinking I'm using an expensive digital camera like professionals  do. I've purchased the kodak batteries and charger, it seem give the camera  longer life than conventional AA batteries. The imaging software supplied  very hard to use, therefore I'm using microsoft photo editor that I very  familiar. If you insist to evaluate the quality, you can access the sample  I took at my website at [...]","I love the Kodak DC 215 camera that was purchased before we went on our  honeymoon.  We bought two 16MB memory cards because we didn't have access  to a PC where we were going.  Tons of pictures, no film.. and we know right  away if the shot is messed up and can retake it!<br />It goes through normal  AA batteries like crazy, but I've heard it works much better and more  efficient with the rechargable batteries available from Kodak.<br />This  camera will impress you and your friends and family. The highest rez and  quality produces some fantastic pics - I've never seen pics of this quality  before.<br />It's very durable (trust me, it's been to Mexico and back,  kayaking, and got toted around in my purse for days) - the design is sturdy  and you won't feel like you need to baby it.<br />We bought this one instead  of a comparable model from a competitor that uses floppy disks - we easily  would have had to take 30+ disks with us on vacation!  This is the way to  go if you will be away from your computer for a while.","I received this camera for my birthday and really like it a lot.  It's a big upgrade from the Casio QV-11 I was using.<br />What makes this camera  great?  Well, it is very easy to use.  It's simple to change the settings,  uplink to your PC and use in general.  And the results are really top  notch.<br />It also feels much more durable and is nicer to handle than  comparable models made by Olympus, Canon and Minolta.<br />The way I have  the camera set up, it takes 35 pictures at a very nice resolution and  quality on the 4MB Compact Flash card that is included.  I just bought the  16MB Flash because I'm using the camea so much, so keep in mind that at  some point you may be dropping another $40-50 on memory, as the amount that  comes with the DC-215 is passable, but not spectacular.","This is the best buy I ever did!<br />I bought the Gold millenium package of the Kodak DC215. It is exactly the same camera as the standard DC215, which comes in silver. It adds a 8MB flash card instead of 4MB and a fast USB  card reader. I regretted the purchase somewhat after I found out that my  two year old PC doesn't have a USB plug, so I have to use the serial cable,  which is also provided as a slower alternative. I also found the 8MB card  just too small for a weekend trip. Since digital pictures are essentially  'free', I tend to make more pictures than I used to. The 8MB card is good  for some 40 to 50 pictures. I am now thinking about a 64 MB card in order  to avoid laborious selecting and erasing of pictures on the road.  Altogether, after checking your PC, I recommend the silver DC215.<br />I had  the camera working out of teh box in two minutes! Installing the PC  application was really easy and my first pictire was on the web in 15  minutes. The camera does consume power quickly. I found it unworkable with  4 standard AA batteries. I bought a charger and 8 Ni-Mh batteries from the  KODAK website. It is a great addition to the camera! The batteries are good  for two to three weeks vacation use. The charger is a really nice and  compact design; highly recommended!<br />Now on the camera itself: It is an  amazing camera that makes crystal sharp picture beyond belief. Having had  12 normal camera's before, I know what it takes to make good pictures. This  camera has some outstanding features:  (a) an incredible wide angle which  allows for great indoor pictures  (b) a powerful flashlight that does a  great jobs under all circumstances. I normally works automatically, but can  be forced to flash, which gives really nice 'fill-in' light effects. (c)  incredible sharpness over the whole 'depth' of the picture. Nearby objects  (up to 3 inches, no kidding! ) and far away objects remain crystal clear  and sharp.  (d) a clear LCD that, after getting used to, is the best way to  take pictures (instead of putting the camear in front of your eye) (e) an  easy user interface on the camera to review pictures  (f) the TV cable is  just fun! It amazes people that you can see the pictures immediately on the  big TV screen.  (g) easy upload of JPEG files to attach to your emails.  With our family living in Europe this is a great feature that is really a  lot of fun. (h) The LCD screen shows the picture for 20 seconds after  taking it. This is a great feature on trips: Take a picture and show people  what it looks like and offer to send them it afterwards by email. It makes  friends quickly!<br />Finally: if you're in the market today to buy a digital  camera, you have to realize the following. There are three price bands:  $300; $300-$550, and $550 and above. If you're a professional, you probably  do not read my review and you're in for the $550 and above category. If you  want 'something better than the rest', you should buy a camera of the  second category $300-$550. I warn you though, that cameras in that category  will decrease in price sharply and will cost only $300 in 12-15 months. So  my take is: buy a $300 camera. You will not be disappointed. And with the  Kodak DC215 you buy an amazing piece of equipment.","this is one camera i love. it has a great LCD and super software bundle. i really wish i could rate higher than 5 stars. the only thing that i would reccomended is a 4 pack of AA lithium batteries.<br />there is absolutely  nothing wrong with this camera. so go ahead, buy yourself one.","I purchased this camera as an upgrade from my DC50 and have been in impressed with it every since I've opened the package.  The camera was ready to go within minutes of opening the box and the software was simple  to install and had me downloading pictures to my web site within ten  minutes.<br />I purchased the DC215 millennium gold due to the larger compact  flash (8mg) and the inclusion of the USB compact flash reader.  Both  additions have made this an excellent camera.  I recently toured Harpers  Ferry National Battlefield and took several pictures of the surrounding  scenery as well as group photos, and amazed the group by displaying the  pictures on the T.V. via the direct camera link as soon as we returned  home.  They turned out crisp, detailed and in perfect focus!<br />The camera  is a little hard on AA batteries so I went out and bought lithium batteries  and have not had to replace them in over three weeks of constant use.  Rechargeable might be the next step but right now I'm having way too much  fun with this camera and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a  megapixel on a modest budget.  It's both IBM and MAC compatible, with loads  of great software!"]},{"name":"Olympus D-450 Zoom (C920Z)","amazon_reviews":["Bought this camera thinking that I could find the other parts that go with easily but I am still okking for some of the parts and the memory card.

It works effortlessly on my Windows XP. My favorite feature is the 3X optical zoom (digital zooms are generally useless).

I wouldn't expect less from Olympus. Regarding complaints about lack of a USB port for downloading: Just get a SmartMedia card reader. A good card reader costs less than twenty dollars and simplifies your life a lot. I personally use PNY SmartMedia card reader but any good card reader should do.

Realtor - Since 1945 (54 Years)","I bought this camera for my parents for christmas and we haven't owned a camera for 20 years.  This up to date, technologically advanced camera is great for the beginner family with an easy to use instruction manual.","In a previous review I stated we purchased this camera before Christmas and had excellent results.  We used only the automatic setting and it produced outstanding results without flash.  This has turned into an outstanding camera for my wife, who refused to focus a 35mm.<br />Since  initial use we continue to be impressed with the features and flexibility  this camera gives us.  We have been able to produce great shots, and with  the ability to edit, enlarge etc.<br />Several observations and  comments:<br />This camera will eat batteries.  We purchased nicad  rechargeable, and are getting similar life compared to Alkaline.  Save some  money here.<br />Purchase additional smart cards, (memory).  We purchased two  additional 16MB and have found that SHQ is the only way to go.  You can't  improve the quality once a picture is taken, but you sure can regret a poor  quality photo.<br />We purchased Flashpath, and really don't use it.  We found  that the serial download is adequate.  NO, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO VIEW IN 5  MINUTES, but how many times will you need to?  A 16 MB (full of SHQ) takes  15-20 minutes to download.  I set it up, leave it and come back.  We are  blessed with extra drive space and have started designating a separate file  for each photo set. You can do this with Windows Explorer before  downloading.  You can delete the ones you don't like, and by naming the sub  files you create make it easy to locate and use pictures later.<br />We  purchased Microsoft picture it 4.0.  For most purposes we find it much  easier to use than Adobe, and for the price very useful.<br />To sum up, my  wife originally told me,\" you take the pictures, I'll just tell you which  ones I want you to print\", BOY HAS THIS CHANGED.  The camera and software  are so easy to use that she is taking pictures, downloading, editing,  printing, AND TRANSMITTING FILES OVER THE INTERNET.  She was telling a  friend about an item she saw in a newspaper ad, She took a picture of the  AD, downloaded the picture, and sent it, all in less than 5 minutes.  We  have only touched the surface of what we can accomplish with this camera.  WE WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE WHO WHATS GOOD PHOTOS WITHOUT HAVING TO  WORK AT IT!","As so many others have noted, this is a GREAT camera for the money. It's loaded with features seen only on more expensive digital cameras (changeable ISO values, great low light capability, a true optical zoom lens with the ability to add 2X digital zoom on top...I could go on and on  about the *pros*.....there are so many!<br />Here are the *cons* I've picked  up so far:<br />1. Camera does eats its four AA alkaline batteries quickly,  especially if you use the LCD a lot. THE FIX: I purchased rechargeable 1400  mv NiMH Nexcells and a Maha C204F charger for under $40 online and neatly  solved this problem.<br />2. Not the most intuitive menu and button system.  THE FIX: reading the manual before trying to use does help. A *quick guide*  sheet comes with the camera...keep it handy to figure out those features  you don't use often. Now I know how to use the features that are important  to me and don't have to refer to the manual any longer.<br />2. Manual is  confusing with three languages/page. THE FIX: English is primarily on the  left-hand pages so look there first. Dog-ear the content index page so it's  easier to find what you are looking for later, and keep the one-page  \"quick guide\" that comes with the camera handy.<br />4. If you are  going to take panoramic photos, ONLY THE ***OLYMPUS*** SmartMedia CARDS  WILL SUPPORT THIS FEATURE! If you purchase less-expensive brands like  SanDisk, you won't be able to take panoramas. THE FIX: Purchase Olympus  SmartMedia cards on auction sites or at bidding sites online...I bought my  Olympus 32 mb card for $45 under the Olympus website price.<br />5. Slow photo  download rate. First of all, I didn't find the serial port download overly  slow, especially compared to other digital cameras. However, since camera  has to be on during the download, I recommend purchasing an AC Adapter  (doesn't have to be Olympus brand) to save on batteries. But if you're a  speed freak, then THE FIX: Purchase either the USB or FlashPath Floppy Disk  Adapter....either will speed up download time considerably.<br />Bottom line  for me....best camera for the money, hands down! Buy one for yourself and  see!","I purchased this camera after reading the reviews and have not been disappointed. This camera is light and small enough and has all the functionality you would want (except if you're a professional photographer). Once you get familiar with the icons, the camera is pretty  staright-forward. And if you're looking to buy rechargable batteries along  with this camera, do not buy the Olympus ones. I bought the Kodak  recharagble batteries and charger and they work fine. Another tip, get the PCMCIA card for  faster uploads if you have the slot and get the Delkin Devices one, it is  cheaper yet just as good. I saved myself quite a bit of money this way.<br />I  also purchased an additonal 16 Mb NewMedia film card but you can buy other  brands for cheaper. All you'll have to do is format the card and it'll work  fine with this camera.","I have been shoping for a digital camera and this one seemed to be the best one for the money.You will not find one any cheeper in stores, that is near me.I like to point out some fetures that the beginner user that I  am,figured out.The zoom is quick to respond,you can take 122 pictures but  the clearity of the print isn't great,you have to select 36 pics.It takes 4  AA batterys,and eats them up in no time.I recomend buying the recharable  pack,also get the a\\c adapter,it takes some time to download pictures to  the pc.The software that came with the camara really supports the  process,it's great!you can put your pictures on greeting  cards,calenders,ect.I love the camara,still leaning how to use it,you will  have to spend 2-3 hundred more to get something better","I have a new ****osonic digital camera, higher end xxx2590.  Had it for about 10 days,  14 day return policy.  A lot of neat features including a modem card to send pics to computer or fax. (Really neat).  The pics I took  were inside requiring flash.  Pics were printed directaly to an HP1000  PhotoSmart on photo paper.  NOT HAPPY WITH SHARPNESS & BRIGHTNESS of  photos.  The Olympus D450 was recommended and after reading all these  reviews, I am switching to the 450.  I will be back to comment on the  difference in about 10 -12 days.  Hope it's as good as you all say it is.  Posted 3 stars for now...!  Hoping there will be 5 Stars. PCBob","We purchased this just before Christmas.  We have found the camera extremely easy to use, and produces excellent results.  Great for general family use.","I received this camera for Christmas.  It has made many wonderful pix to date.  Love it. I would reccomend it to anyone.  Great features and optical zoom that gets you in close.  Download time slow.  Needs a USB plug.  Optional.","Run and buy this camera. I received this a xmas present, and have not stopped telling people about this amazing product. My mom, who is not very techy, loved taking pictures and found it very easy to use, but left the  processing to me. The 3x Optical Zoom gives you great close-ups. The camera  is very easy to use, once you figure out the menus. the flash is very  powerful, can make a dark room at night look like a daytime picture. The  video-out allows you to give friends and family a slide show of your  favorite pictures. Color is superior to any other camera I have seen. I  took pictures and printed on Epson 740 with Epson Photo Paper, my mom was  amazed, she thought I had got my pictures developed at the store. The photo  quality was fantastic. Buy a film reader, buy rechargeables and buy a 32mb  smartmedia card (Holds 146 HQ Pictures). The included software is  wonderful, went onto Win98 without any trouble. The software allows you to  change backgrounds, really do amazing things with your pictures. I am  really impressed with this product. The only drawback is the batteries it  eats. (20 batteries in 8 days)","Just picked up my oly yesterday and already have taken about a dozen pics and emailed some and reprinted some. I am a true novice when it comes to cameras so for me to get that far that soon is saying something about this user friendly camera.I also bought the smart media writer which is really  cool. Rechargable batteries are a must. Happy so far.","Purchased this camera just before Christmas.  Did not have time to read the owner's manual.  The Christmas photos came out looking great.  With a little more time under my belt.  I read the owner's manual.  Yesterday I  took the camera to NYC for a family outing.  The photo's looked fantastic.  The ability to control the metering between spot and average really saved  some of the strong backlight shots.  The night photos with no  flash...excellent quaity.  I can't wait to print them to see just how good  the resloution is.","This camera is a lot of fun!  It's my first digital camera and I found it easy to get started taking pics.  You do need to read the instruction manual if you want to do more than just basic picture taking.  But in just  a few minutes you can get going.  Definitely get the flashpath adapter  (it'll save a lot of time downloading pics to your PC).  The panaramic  \"stitching\" program that comes with it is really cool.","I love this camera i feel like it has changed the way i look at digital photography. I recieved the camera and it was broken but theres always something. That was taken care of in no time. I read the never ending novel  of a manual and was shortly after I was having fun and taking photo quality  images this camera is for everyone it is easy to use and gives professional  results. there is a feature for every thing zoom, macro lenz, five flashes,  rapid shooting and more this camera is a great value its equivliant in  other brands is twice the cost. Serial port downloads are quick and high in  quality I reccomend that you do not waste money on a floppy adapter or usb  downloader unless you use  a imac,G3,or G4. Software bundle is a great  collection and has everything you need. Im glad I went with Olympus.","I have enjoyed the versatility of the D-450Z, a first venture into digital cameras - a lot more fun and fast than freeze frames from 8mm.  My only challenge was downloading the pics.  Oh man that serial port is slow  through the two software titles Olympus ships with the camera, but I made a  discovery.  Click on your camera in the file tree of Windows Explorer.  The  preview of your pictures comes up fast.  Copy to the folder you wish, name  the files, and then use the Camedia software to edit the pictures.  Very  cool.  A must buy!","The overall quality and performance of the camera is very good.  Images produced at the SHQ (super high quality) setting are of higher quality than those produced with most conventional cameras.  I am happy with my purchase  and would recommend it to others.","I am very pleased with this camera.  I purchased it because itis more like a \"real\" camera than other digicams I haveseen.  I like being able to choose \"film speeds\" and aperature settings as on a 35 mm.  This is my first digital camera, so it took a couple days to get used to all the controls.  However, the camera takes great pictures on fully-automatic mode, so you can start taking snapshots right away.  I also found that pictures in daylight turn out much sharper than night-time flash photos.  Maybe I just need more practice with the flash settings.<br />I would recommend rechargeable batteries (I purchased the less-expensive Kodak NiMH batteries instead of the Olympus brand).  I would also highly recommend a USB SmartMedia card reader (if you have a Mac or Windows 98).  I bought a Fuji USB reader, and it makes transferring your photos to your PC a snap.  It was easy to install, and it appears as a removable drive in Windows Explorer.  So I just use Explorer to cut and paste from the card to my hard drive.<br />The software is also pretty good.  The panorama stitching software looks pretty cool, but I have yet to test it out.<br />\"Every time you close the lens cover, it hits the lens.\" Not so.  You close the lens cover to the half-way point, the lens will retract, and then you fully close the cover.  Second, \"You have to turn the camera off in order to preview your pictures on the LCD.\" Again, not true. You can leave the lens cover open, and \"double-click\" on the display button.  This allows you to preview your pics on the LCD.","Purchased the 450Z after a lot of research, have had it for a couple months now and absolutely LOVE it.  Agree with other comments on slow (frustrating) D/L speed using the serial cable, and definitely recommend  the FlashPath reader.  Before you jump to buy a cheaper camera, take into  consideration the features that the 450Z offers that, even if you're a  novice, you'll probably not want to live without, i.e., optical zoom, 8MB  memory card included, and photo settings usually found only on high-end  cameras (overcast conditions, fluorescent lighting, etc.)  One of the best  features I used this week was the ability to take great photos of my  newborn grandson on the delivery table with the flash OFF!  Auto  shutter-speed compensated for the flash off and produced extraordinary  photos!  All digicams are battery hogs, but I was able to take about 120  photos (med res) before replacing them (I rarely use the LCD monitor, and  never use battery power for D/L'ing pics).  You MUST read the manual from  cover to cover before using the camera for the first time, but now I only  refer to it when using a setting I don't normally use.  AC/DC port is not  standard and I was forced to get a converter from Radio Shack that has  several different adapter plugs (cheap).  PhotoShop Home Deluxe s/w  included, but BEWARE -- make sure your PC video card drivers are  up-to-date.  Go to your PC-makers website and D/L the latest updates before  installing this s/w.  I had major conflicts with the video drivers req'd by  PhotoShop and the 18-month old drivers on my Gateway.  All in all, I am  extremely satisfied with the 450Z.  The only improvements I'd recommend to  Olympus is replacing the serial D/L connection with a USB compatible one,  making the camera a little more user-friendly so the manual is not so  indispensable, changing the AC/DC input to something more standard, and  include a FlashPath adapter with the camera.  Unless you abhor reading  manuals and instructions, you won't go wrong with this camera.","This is an excellent, well-designed product that you won't want to leave at home no matter where you go. Picture quality is excellent and with a SmartMedia adapter to make transferring pictures to your PC easy, you won't  miss the old tradition of developing film. Despite some opinions, battery  life for this camera is good compared to others I've used. A charger would  be a good investment, though. All in all, the ease of a point-and-shoot  with professional features tastefully integrated--a tough camera to beat.","I joined the digital parade after an agonizing 6 months of comparison and indecision.  I liked the Sony Mavica features, especially the floppy disk method of storing images.  I've used my work's Mavica 91 and loved its  simplicity and great ability to take indoor pictures without a flash.  I  also loved the rechargeable 'smart' battery which Sony sells with its  product; it actually tells you how much time you have remaining before a  battery change is required.  It could also do short MPEG motion pictures -  with sound. The big negative:  it's huge and weighed a ton.  It's  resolution wasn't sufficient either.<br />I finally ended up with the Olympus  450z because of its high resolution, its available floppy adapter, its many  features for the price, and its compact size -- its virtually identical to  my old 35MM model.  It takes great pictures, but isn't as capable in low  light conditions as the Mavica 91.<br />The Panaroma picture capability was a  feature which I never thought of using -- until I saw the software demo  which was included with the camera.  It's like magic -- it puts together a  panarama of pictures into a single composite image.  Truly amazing.<br />In  summary, the 450 is a great camera, albeit only slightly better than the  400 - and doesn't include the floppy adapter as the 400 did.  Great - yes,  but the price really hasn't dropped as I had hoped.  Finally, if you're  thinking ahead, you'll order 8 or 12 NiMH batteries and a recharger, a 16  or 32 meg SMART Card, and the Floppy adapter.  You've suddenly got yourself  a $700-$800 camera outfit.  Shop around - there are cheaper places to buy  your camera.","I agree with most of the comments posted but I use the serial cable and it is the slowest method but not that slow(less than two minutes for a 8 meg card). The Adobe software is very cumbersome to use.  I just want to  download and print the pictures I need. I found copying the image to  Microsoft Word the easiest method. The camera itself is easy to use, just  slide open the lens cover and point and click.  Use good, glossy, photo  paper and the digital photographs look almost the same a normal picture.","A couple things: Pros:  1. I have dropped my Olympus d450 several times, and once I slammed it in a car door (in its case). For some strange reason, it still works fine.<br />2.  You can get an mp3 player that uses the same type of memory card (smartmedia), buy a 32 Meg (smartmedia) chip, and reformat the card  for either device when the occasion  calls. A 32 meg card can hold either a couple hundred pictures, or about an  hour of music.<br />3. The floppy adapter works well to transfer files to/from  the smartmedia card, and a usb smartmedia card reader works even better.  However, downloading data using camera and serial cable is quiet an  frustrating process (batteriy draning, time intensive, etc.)<br />CONS- 1:  Start stockpiling AA batteries now, especially if you really like using the  LCD screen instead of the viewfinder.<br />2: This isn't the kind of camera  you can whip out real fast and and take an instantaneous photo.  It takes  about four seconds from when you slide the cover open to when you can snap  a picture.<br />All in all, a good buy","I too had held off on digital cameras.  I shoot mostly slides, adore my zoom and macro lenses and expect a lot from my images.  I was looking at the high end prosumer Olympus (C2000) and Nikon (950).  Drooling is more  like it.  Then I started reading reviews of the D450Z on  [...] and others.  Sounded like a near perfect  compromise.  While the images won't stand up to extreme enlargement, how  often do we really do that with our pictures.  I got the camera a couple  days before heading out on a trip and was delighted with how easy it was to  carry and use.  No more rolls of film to manage.  The images were sharp,  good color balance and I took night time images, hand held, without flash  that would stand up against commercial postcards.  The zoom isn't as long  as I'd like but you can't expect that of a point and shoot.  Get an extra  smartmedia card, NIMH batteries (though I did 56 pics on just over one set  of batteries - with the LCD on).  Olympus' new Smartmedia reader rocks.  Downloads become a matter of seconds.  I couldn't expect more from this  camera.  I'll still keep my SLR for those National Geographic trips but it  might be just a matter of time before it'll be replaced too.  I guess I'd  better get busy digitizing all those slides.","Wife bought camera for gift.  Owners manual suggest using AC adapter to download pictures to PC.  Can't find the Adapter.  No internet site  advertises and no store front carries it.  Can't buy it on Olympus site, no  option to do so. I don't want the floppy adapter.  AC adapter is more  suitable for me.<br />Other wise, this is camera is the best.  Would give 5  stars if adapter was available.","I am one who always jumps into new tech stuff during the first or second wave.  I have been holding off on a digital camera purchase for more of a value reason than anything else.  When I saw this camera loaded with  features combined with my experience with Olympus, I knew I was time to  buy.  I was still slightly fearful that the process from taking shot to  downloading it to my harddrive would be cumbersome; however, this was not  true.<br />The software that comes with this camera is powerful yet straight  foward and easy to use.  The images are great and a lot of fun to have  instantly.  IT WORKS JUST LIKE A GOOD AUTO FOCUS 35MM.<br />Cons:  Uses  batteries quick if you use the LCD and during the download to PC process.  It takes a long time to download a 8mb smartmedia card (30-40 pics @ medium  quality).  It does not come with a case.  The LCD is just below the optical  eye opening so your fat nose smudges the LCD screen everytime you take a  picture.<br />FINAL WORD:  BUY IT  --- IT'S GREAT along with:  1.  Case  2.  Rechargable Batteries  3.  Get a 3.5\" Floppy Smartmedia Reader and  skip the download process all together.","THE D450 IS MY SECOND DIGITAL CAMERA. MY FIRST WAS THE D200L WHICH I STILL USE IS NOW 4 YEARS OLD. I ALMOST BOUGHT THE C2000Z UNTIL I SAW THE 450 , UNLESS YOU ARE SHOOTING PICS FROM 300 FEET AWAY WHO NEEDS A 2 MEGAPIXLE  CAMERA OR THE GIANT FILE THAT IT CREATES. THE 3 LANGUAGE MANUAL NEEDS TO GO  (HERE ME OLYMPUS ! ) IF YOU PLAN ON PRINTING PICS , I HAVE AN HP970 WHICH  DOES THE BEST JOB I HAVE SEEN ANYWHERE, IF YOU HAVE A XXXXX PRINTER I AM  VERY SORRY... I GAVE AWAY 3 XXXXXX (A 610 & 2 5000'S - SLOW IS ONLY  GOOD FOR KETCHUP) GET A USB CARD READER-- VERY FAST-- ONLY WAY TO GO--  & A 32 MB CARD & 3 OR 4 SETS OF NICADS, YES NICADS- MUCH CHEAPER. I  AM STILL USING 2 SETS THAT ARE LEFT OVER FROM THE D200 THAT ARE AT LEAST 2  YEARS OLD. I HAVE RECHARGED THE BATTRIES ONCE A WEEK OR MORE FOR OVER 2  YEARS & TAKEN THOUSANDS OF PICTURES WITH THEM. LOOK TO SPEND ABOUT  $250.00 ON TOP OF THE CAMERA  WITH THE BATTS, 32MB CARD & USB READER.","I bought this camera because my wife was tired of scanning pictures for online auctions.  When I saw how good the pictures were, and how well they printed on an HP PhotoSmart printer (even the 640x480 as an 8x10 was  beautiful!) I realized I had a great match!  Get NiMH batteries, for sure,  but you can use it without the screen and save power.  Also, Olympus sells  (and you can get it here at Amazon) a PCMCIA adapter for the SmartMedia  cards, which pretends to be a spare hard drive.  Cool!  Get the 16 or 32 MB  Card if you take lots of pics, but at lowest res I get 240+ pics on a 16MB  chip.","Bang for buck, this is THE best and most versatile  all around digital camera to get.  I recommend that you buy 8 NiMH batteries and a charger.  The supplied alkaline batteries are just to get you started.  I also  recommend a 16 or 32 MB memory card if you intend to use this camera while  disk adapter.  It does come with a serial cable for PC and Mac as well as a  video cable for viewing on your TV.<br />For turning your digital photos into  real prints, I've had good luck with EZ Prints ([...]  You use  their free software to send them your photos and your prints arrive in the  mail.  This overcomes the last drawback of digital cameras.  There may be  other similar services that do this so shop around for the best  picture you just took, just double-click the 'screen' button. This way you  won't have to close the camera to switch modes.","Great camera for under $500 range.  Takes about 30 mins. to figure out all the features and functions.  Could have been shorter if manual was easier to read, they combine all 3 lang on all the pages.  Get yourself some NI-MH  recarchable batteries, they will last you 150-200 shots.  Also, get a 32meg  SM card (olympus brand if you can find them) and a SmartCard USB reader for  faster transfers to your PC.","Get a 32MB Smartmedia card and you will not need anything else. That stores about 150 high res pictures.","I started out thinking I was still a year away from affording a new digital camera with the features I wanted.  I decided to hold out for a zoom lens and at least 1024 x 768 resolution, or wait.  After a lot of  research, I knew I wanted an Olympus, because of their excellent optics and  their camera-first, digital-device-second approach, and because my Olympus  35mm point-and-shoot had served me well.<br />I thought my best deal would be  on a used or discontinued model; however, because the original price of the  500L, 600L, and 400Z had been so high (in the $800-1200 range), the asking  prices for these had not come down as much as I'd hoped, and what I had to  be willing to pay had crept up as I shopped.  When I saw what the 450Z was  going for, I whipped out my credit card.  Now that I've played around with  it for a few weeks, I can't imagine there's a better digital camera for the  money right now.  I've compared with a couple of friends that have Nikon  CoolPix cameras, and I suppose there's something that's better about them,  but I can't honestly tell you what that would be, and the Nikon is twice  the money!<br />The 450Z is an improved version of the well-received 400Z, but  at a radically lower street price.  Some of this is due to the packaging --  the 450Z leaves out the FlashPath floppy adapter (typically $70-90 alone)  that was standard in the 400Z -- but clearly the manufacturing costs are  coming down rapidly.<br />This camera performs incredibly well on the  bottom-line measurement:  It takes stunningly detailed and accurate  pictures under a wide variety of conditions.<br />We've gotten used to  accepting less than perfection for pictures taken in other than bright  sunlight at normal distances.  The 450Z adds several categories of  picture-taking where you can now get predictable results:  Flash, macro  (including with flash), indoor lighting, low light, etc.  There are just  enough features to make the camera useful over the range of conditions, but  not so many as to intimidate the snap-shooter.  Because of the intelligence  of the autofocus, exposure control, and white balance, it is still a great  point-and-shoot camera.<br />Many features are related to getting the picture  right at the right resolution, such as spot metering, exposure override,  mode (resolution), different flash modes, macro, etc.  Other features are  related to viewing and managing the pictures you've taken.  You can plug  the camera into a VCR or TV monitor (RCA video jack) and give a quick  slideshow of what's in memory.  You can get around the small size of the  LCD display (and this is one of the better ones) by zooming in on one  segment (out of a 3 x 3 grid) of an image, to make sure the detail is  there.<br />One other feature that other reviewers have found important:  The  450Z will store images uncompressed, if you choose (the file size is huge);  most other cameras up to this point perform at least some compression, even  on high-quality settings.<br />The only thing I couldn't do well -- and this  may just take some practice -- is action shots.  All digital cameras have  some lag between the time you decide to pull the trigger and the time the  image is committed to memory, and this takes some getting used to, but the  450Z is quicker in this respect than its earlier counterparts.  One  significant feature is the \"burst mode\", which allows you to keep  capturing images (about 1-2 a second) as long as the shutter button is  pressed, and until the buffer fills up (seems to be about 6-10  images).<br />Most of us get into digital because of the cost and overhead of  dealing with film and processing, only to have to scan prints or pay extra  to the processor for digital images from film.  Depending on resolution,  you can get up to 122 images onto the standard 8MB memory card before  unloading, and that's very liberating -- no more agonizing over whether to  take another shot!  However, once you play around with it a while, the mind  starts to boggle at the possibilities, and film cameras seem like Stone-Age  technology (especially since we are approaching the resolution of film with  the million-plus pixels you can store in an image now).<br />The 450Z is a  milestone in the improvement of digital cameras, a quantum leap in value  vs. features and quality, even compared to other Olympus cameras.  You  won't believe how easy it is to get breath-taking digital photos.  Get one!"]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-D770","amazon_reviews":["I've been waiting for over a year to find a decently priced digital camera that has the feel of an SLR.

But I gotta admit, I loved it, I loved the colors, and it served me well. I actually wrote for a national locksmith magazine at the time, and some of the pictures published in the magazine came from this camera. I have since moved-on...and the camera is now in Mongolia with my wifey 8-year old nephew. Ha ha ha.","Since there are still a number of these available used through Amazon Markeplace, I thought I'd add a quick review myself.<br /><br />My parents bought one in about 2004, and apparently used it very little. I inherited it in like new condition. I'm a \"moderate-advanced amateur\" photographer, own several cameras including a Sony/Minolta DSLR. This camera, as others have noted, takes VERY good pictures and is well made and easy to operate. Many times higher resolution just isn't needed, especially if you do a lot of web photography like I do. Put an upgraded CF card in it (a CF slot instead of SD/XD/whatever are another sign of quality) and you're good for hundreds or even thousands of shots!<br /><br />The only down side is that it *is* slow by today's standards. Its highest ISO is only 200 if I remember correctly (maybe not even that high), and CF write times are a bit on the long side. The proprietary USB/Serial connector is annoying in 2011, the original cable for mine is long gone and you can't use a standard USB cable - which isn't a real big problem since I generally use a card reader anyway.<br /><br />I'd say this camera is much better built, and takes better pictures than most of the sub $100 \"blister pack\" cameras out there - as long as 2MP is enough resolution.","I own the DC 280 and I had bought it in August 2000. This camera is special. I have tried many other cameras & though this is not a high resolution camera, the photos come out great, at times even better than high megapixel cameras. Though it does eat the battery power quickly, I do not have any complaints as I use the Kodak rechargeable batteries, which have lasted me for a long time. I'm currently using the third installment (you need 4 batteries) of the Kodak rechargeable batteries. Plus since they are AA size, those batteries can be used with other cameras or light devices.<br /><br />I know that this camera is not available for sale. But if you are looking for a cheap camera on any auction website (Amazon, Ebay), then I say go for it.","I actually bought one of these at a yard sale for 80 bucks, since previously I owned and used a Kodak dc 240.  I don't quite know why this series of cameras take such amazingly sharp pictures (my 240 (1.2 MP) takes sharper photos than my 3.2 MP sony!!!)but they just do.  The 280 has a more limited zoom (2x as opposed to a 3x), but the picture quality is amazing.  You cannot buy a 2MP camera that takes sharper and more realistic pictures than the 280.  The new Kodak series with the docking ports are made differently and they are not as good about focusing or sharpness of image.  The 280 is a great investment!! I've seen prints from the 280 looking better than some 4MP cameras!! And that's all I have to say about that :)","my dad had baught this camera 3years ago and then recently he gave it to me. its  a good camera, the only thing is, the lense cap keeps comming off. great camera, cheap lense cap.  picture quality is good, indoor and outdoor. the only other thing is that when the batteries get low it'll stop using the flash, which gets really annoying sometimes but normally isn't a problem. it can also stand SOME banging around, but not much. oh, and that little plastic covering at the bottom of the right hand corner of the camera peeled off recently but that doens't affect the camera's performance!","After much research, I recommended the DC280 for my friend's company almost three years ago, and since then it has taken THOUSANDS of pics, most of them STUNNING good color and clarity. Whether taken inside or outside, of products, people or nature shots, the DC280 seemed to handle everything we threw at it - including getting DROPPED several times and getting WET and DIRTY on numerous occasions (not that I recommend it). Recently my friend bought a Canon G2 and GAVE me his \"old\" Kodak DC280 - and it STILL takes stunning pictures as if it was brand new! Therefore, if you can find a good used DC280 or DC290 for a decent price, I can GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed with the durability of the camera or the quality of the pictures!","This is my first digital camera, and I love it! I did some research before I bought, but I'm not an expert on any of the technical stuff.<br />I can say that as a beginner, I have found that all of the basic functions are intuitive. I played around with the camera before getting out the instructions, and realized I had figured out most of the most necessary functions.<br />No software package works on everyone's machine, but the software installed very simply and easily on mine and I haven't had a single problem with it (I run Windows XP Home edition).<br />The part that I had the most reservations about was the actual connection and upload to the computer. Most people have used a camera; but obviously I had never hooked one up to my machine before!<br />It couldn't have been easier. I simply read in the instructions which slot the USB plug went into on the camera -- I had already plugged it into my computer -- turned the camera mode to \"connect\" and flipped it on. Windows recognized the camera, and the photo wizard in XP allows very easy transfer into a folder of your choosing. You can also get the photos directly from the camera and bypass the wizard, but I haven't felt the need to do that.<br />The photos themselves have pretty good color -- I do have to up the contrast more often than not in Paint Shop Pro, but that's not a big deal. The colors, if the light isn't that great, tend to be a little washed out, just like a regular camera.<br />Overall, I love my new camera and have found nothing to complain about. It has performed beautifully and it's easy to use. I recommend this camera to any newbie who wants a middle-of-the-line machine.","I bought this camera about three years ago when digital was just coming of age. Also have the DC 5000 at my office which is basically the same camera in a more durable shell.  My personal 280 has traveled with me almost around the earth and it always works! You just need to prepare--I always take at least three sets of batteries, a few cards and a quick charger wherever I go. One great thing about the 280 is that it uses AA batteries. Try finding a propritary battery in Cozumal Mexico.  The shots I have taken always receive praise about the clarity and color, even at low compression rates.  Part of my job is to put together a newsletter. We just started trying out a Nikon Coolpix 5000 camera for going out and getting newspaper quality snapshots. Not to badmouth Nikon or anything, but everyone wants to go back to the Kodak for it's simplicity and guaranteed results.<br />I'm looking for a small pocket size camera like the elph because of it's portability.  I think I might wait for the S400 Canon.  But I would never sell the 280, because it's always there as a backup. It just simply works well for most things.","This camera really does it all and takes great pictures.  The only real shortcoming is the LCD screen.  It is a bit fuzzy and usually the photos look much better when they are shown on a computer or television screen.  One other nice feature is that it may be connected via serial or USB port.","Dang...super old camera and technology. But I gotta admit, I loved it, I loved the colors, and it served me well.

The proprietary USB/Serial connector is annoying in 2011, the original cable for mine is long gone and you can't use a standard USB cable - which isn't a real big problem since I generally use a card reader anyway.<br /><br />I'd say this camera is much better built, and takes better pictures than most of the sub $100 \"blister pack\" cameras out there - as long as 2MP is enough resolution.","I own the DC 280 and I had bought it in August 2000. This camera is special. I have tried many other cameras & though this is not a high resolution camera, the photos come out great, at times even better than high megapixel cameras. Though it does eat the battery power quickly, I do not have any complaints as I use the Kodak rechargeable batteries, which have lasted me for a long time. I'm currently using the third installment (you need 4 batteries) of the Kodak rechargeable batteries. Plus since they are AA size, those batteries can be used with other cameras or light devices.<br /><br />I know that this camera is not available for sale. But if you are looking for a cheap camera on any auction website (Amazon, Ebay), then I say go for it.","I actually bought one of these at a yard sale for 80 bucks, since previously I owned and used a Kodak dc 240.  I don't quite know why this series of cameras take such amazingly sharp pictures (my 240 (1.2 MP) takes sharper photos than my 3.2 MP sony!!!)but they just do.  The 280 has a more limited zoom (2x as opposed to a 3x), but the picture quality is amazing.  You cannot buy a 2MP camera that takes sharper and more realistic pictures than the 280.  The new Kodak series with the docking ports are made differently and they are not as good about focusing or sharpness of image.  The 280 is a great investment!! I've seen prints from the 280 looking better than some 4MP cameras!! And that's all I have to say about that :)","my dad had baught this camera 3years ago and then recently he gave it to me. its  a good camera, the only thing is, the lense cap keeps comming off. great camera, cheap lense cap.  picture quality is good, indoor and outdoor. the only other thing is that when the batteries get low it'll stop using the flash, which gets really annoying sometimes but normally isn't a problem. it can also stand SOME banging around, but not much. oh, and that little plastic covering at the bottom of the right hand corner of the camera peeled off recently but that doens't affect the camera's performance!","After much research, I recommended the DC280 for my friend's company almost three years ago, and since then it has taken THOUSANDS of pics, most of them STUNNING good color and clarity. Whether taken inside or outside, of products, people or nature shots, the DC280 seemed to handle everything we threw at it - including getting DROPPED several times and getting WET and DIRTY on numerous occasions (not that I recommend it). Recently my friend bought a Canon G2 and GAVE me his \"old\" Kodak DC280 - and it STILL takes stunning pictures as if it was brand new! Therefore, if you can find a good used DC280 or DC290 for a decent price, I can GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed with the durability of the camera or the quality of the pictures!","This is my first digital camera, and I love it! I did some research before I bought, but I'm not an expert on any of the technical stuff.<br />I can say that as a beginner, I have found that all of the basic functions are intuitive. I played around with the camera before getting out the instructions, and realized I had figured out most of the most necessary functions.<br />No software package works on everyone's machine, but the software installed very simply and easily on mine and I haven't had a single problem with it (I run Windows XP Home edition).<br />The part that I had the most reservations about was the actual connection and upload to the computer. Most people have used a camera; but obviously I had never hooked one up to my machine before!<br />It couldn't have been easier. I simply read in the instructions which slot the USB plug went into on the camera -- I had already plugged it into my computer -- turned the camera mode to \"connect\" and flipped it on. Windows recognized the camera, and the photo wizard in XP allows very easy transfer into a folder of your choosing. You can also get the photos directly from the camera and bypass the wizard, but I haven't felt the need to do that.<br />The photos themselves have pretty good color -- I do have to up the contrast more often than not in Paint Shop Pro, but that's not a big deal. The colors, if the light isn't that great, tend to be a little washed out, just like a regular camera.<br />Overall, I love my new camera and have found nothing to complain about. It has performed beautifully and it's easy to use. I recommend this camera to any newbie who wants a middle-of-the-line machine.","I bought this camera about three years ago when digital was just coming of age. Also have the DC 5000 at my office which is basically the same camera in a more durable shell.  My personal 280 has traveled with me almost around the earth and it always works! You just need to prepare--I always take at least three sets of batteries, a few cards and a quick charger wherever I go. One great thing about the 280 is that it uses AA batteries. Try finding a propritary battery in Cozumal Mexico.  The shots I have taken always receive praise about the clarity and color, even at low compression rates.  Part of my job is to put together a newsletter. We just started trying out a Nikon Coolpix 5000 camera for going out and getting newspaper quality snapshots. Not to badmouth Nikon or anything, but everyone wants to go back to the Kodak for it's simplicity and guaranteed results.<br />I'm looking for a small pocket size camera like the elph because of it's portability.  I think I might wait for the S400 Canon.  But I would never sell the 280, because it's always there as a backup. It just simply works well for most things.","This camera really does it all and takes great pictures.  The only real shortcoming is the LCD screen.  It is a bit fuzzy and usually the photos look much better when they are shown on a computer or television screen.  One other nice feature is that it may be connected via serial or USB port.","Awesome! Great color rendition, sharp pictures, easy to use. Too bad they don't make them anymore.","I've bought the DC-280 camera more than two years ago. Since that I owned many different digital cameras. Technology have changed, resolution increased, weight reduced, size shrunk, but no any new camera can bet the DC-280 color balance and vividness of pictures. I've made a lot of comparisons, asked my friends choose the best one, and DC-280 always won. That's outstanding.","This is a fantastic camera, and I love it to pieces!","I have owned and used this camera for two years now and i still love it. The first thing is this camera takes great pirctures. I go ... and get my pictures printed and they are turn out amazing everytime. The second thing that i like about this camera is that i can normally fill up my 32mb flash card (which mine came with)on one set of battires. One thing that i would highly recomend is a flash card reader, which makes download times alot faster. I use windows xp pro and have not had any trouble. I have some of my pictures at my website ...","I've taken ~1200 pictures... all extremely sharp, especially colors and tones reproduction. Much much sharper and clearer than my brothers' Olympus C3xxx cameras.<br />1 annoying issue, the LCD drains batteries like the Niagara Fall drains water. BUT... I never use it... so it isn't a problem!<br />Oh, I have 3 sets of 4-pack Ni-MH batteries and a 128MB CF, yeah baby!...<br />Had it for 2 years... keeping it for another... 5-6 more years.","A really nice beginners camera. Makes for some good landscape shots, the colors are real close, and the depth of feild is set well for landscape. Portrait shots aren't as nice, but they'll do. Sturdy little thing, been dropped a few times and doesn't seem to mind. Doesn't work good in cold weather however.<br />In my personal opinion, it's not worth the price tag. There are more up-to-date cameras out there with a lot more goodies if you are going to put out that kind of money for a digital point and shot.","This is a very solid camera that takes good pictures indoor or outdoors. It is very user friendly and consistently takes good pictures, no matter who is taking them (Unlike several Sony's I tried before settling on this one).<br />Their are several features on this camera that make it particularly appealing to me.<br />* Accepts any type of AA battery and comes with rechargeable ones<br />* Transfers pictures through USB (can also get a compact flash card reader, I highly reccommend).<br />* Has a Video patch cord that allows you to preview pictures on any TV or VCR with an RCA input.<br />* Accepts Flash Memory of any brand up of 196 MB+ (alot of pictures).<br />* Border software allows you to import different borders for your shots, such as birthdays and weddings.<br />Although the camera is only a 2.0 megapixel, I've learned megapixels don't tell the whole story for the quality of a picture. They only become important if you want to consistently produce picture sizes above 5x7 (8x10 takes a dip in quality).<br />Overall a very good camera for an enry level to average user.<br />If you are a more advanced user with higher resolution needs, you might checkout the Nikon coolpix 900 series, a very good camera, though it is twice the price of the Kodak 280 zoom.","I've had my 280 for a year now and haven't found anything to seriously squawk about. I've shot a good 600 pictures from a 120 degree Arizona summer to a -22 degree Massachusetts Nor'easter. It's been bumped, knocked, and dropped and still takes pictures as good as when it came out of the box.<br />The use is simple enough for even a manager (like myself) to use. Most of the time I just point and shoot and the pictures come out just fine. I like being able to manually adjust the exposure because I find myself inside and not allowed to use the flash. Most of these indoor pic's come out fine.<br />I'm about to graduate to a higher pixel camera but will pass my faithful Kodak onto my son. I just hope I can find another unit as tough and reliable as my 280.","I have had this camera for about a year now and have become the photographer of the family even though others have much more expensive equipment and I really don't know anything about photography.  The detail in the photos along with the color are excellent.  Its alse easy enough to use that you don't have to read the booklet.  The little LCD sreen is not great but it is useful.  It will also print out an impressive 8X10 even though 5x7 is where it really shines.<br />It also does a good job with photos to put on the web whether you are trading pics with distant friends/family or selling items on the net or auctions.  The close-up feature is really great to show detail when selling items as detail helps bring more money when selling/auctioning.<br />This is just a great camera and now there are many opportunities to get it for a lot less than cameras that don't really do much more for the simple photographer.","The DC280 is a nice little camera, but the results I get from it aren't any better than those from oy old DC210 that it replaced. In fact, I find the autofocus to be less accurate, or at least harder to use than with the 210. And, alas, it STILL eats batteries by the ton.","I purchased this camera in place of the DC290, which I had done quite a bit of reading up on.  However, when I went to buy the 290, it was not in stock.  Because I absolutely HAD TO HAVE my new camera that very night, I purchased the DC280.  And I'm glad I did.  It is very easy to use.  You can figure it out without having to read the instructions.  And it takes great pictures - day or night!  The clarity is excellent and comparable to a 35mm.  I've only printed pictures up to 4x6 so far, but they turned out wonderful.  It comes with everything you need to start taking pictures right away - an 8 MB card, rechargeable batteries, a battery charger, and alkaline batteries so you don't have to wait for the others to charge before using your camera.  I bought a card reader so I wouldn't run down the batteries while loading the files to my computer.  I also bought a 64 MB CompactFlash card.  On standard quality, it stores almost 300 pics and on high quality, about 105.  I use the sight finder instead of the LCD display to take pictures and have found that my batteries last quite a while.<br />The DC280 is my third digital camera and by far the best!","It is fair to say that this camera is by no means for the proffessional photographer today. Taken in mind the stunning results this camera is capable of producing, its ease of use, and its usable range of features Im sure it can be a great asset to any first timer digi-cam user. Not only does this camera look good but so do the prints. O.K the feartures are a bit limited, and the zoom could be more powerfull, but consdering the price, this camera offers a lot. Unlike some cameras you dont need to go out and buy loads of accersories, the 8mb picture card included is enough to get the snap happy photographer started, and rechargable battries and charger are also included. I would personnally reccomend this camera to any digi-cam virgin!","This camera takes very good pictures and by itself is very easy to use.  However, the linking software of the PC side is not very user friendly.  One complaint is the optical zoom on the camera is a bit weak.<br />Having the rechargeable battery and charger included, fast USB link, and both PAL and NTSC output format was what made me decided to buy it since I like traveling overseas.  Otherwise I was strongly considering the Olympus and Nikon models.","We bought this camera several years ago and have taken it with us on two trips abroad and many trips around the USA.  I'm not a camera maven but I've just had a terrific experience with this camera.  Our pictures come out clear and sharp.  It is easy to use. The color is great.  The camera feels good in my hands.  Mine came with a 32 mb card and I bought one extra 32mb card.  I can travel for weeks at a time without ever worrying about \"film.\"  I've even dropped the camera by accident a few times without breaking it.  The flash works nicely in a variety of light.  If I had to find one thing to criticize I would pick the zoom lens but I have yet to see a competitive product with a better one.  In short, I've taken thousands of pictures with the camera without a hitch.  In fact, I usually have a big smile on my face when I see the results.  And my friends and family do too.","I have had this camera for over 6 months now and I am happy with the pictures that I have taken. One major problem is with downloading into the computer with this; It ususlly takes several tries and many times just hangs up after a few pictures when it does down load. There are usually errors like no pictures in camera when the flashcard is full. The problem seems to be with the \"twain\"transferring pictures,That is the only way. No one can figure what the problem is but it seems to be the software that came with the camera and the Kodak software that is needed no matter what digital imaging software is used. (I tried 6 different types with all the same problems). Out of frustration I bought an HP photosmart 1250 photo printer that I just plug the flashcard into. With that I usually get outstanding results; the pictures look just like I took them with a Nikon SL 35mm camera.If I could only get the computer download to work as well I could not ask for more. For now I do not download unless I have lots of time to Keep trying. Therefore I dont do it very often anymore, I just print them directly with the printer.","I teach photography and thought this would be a great digital camera to introduce to those hesitant to jump into the digital age.  I have owned since November and have taken over 300 pictures.  My review follows. The great--- 1.  Picture quality is awesome!!! 2.  The weight of the camera feels sturdy. Whereas, some higher priced models weigh the size of a piece of paper.  The good--- 1.  Storage with the generic memory card is good.  Invest in a larger memory card and your set.  34MB is perfect.  (About 60 more images) 2.  Battery life has not been a problem at all.  I did buy another set of rechargable batteries because of other customer reviews. The average--- 1.  Zooming in to objects can be somewhat limited but is adequate. This product rates 4.5 in my book!","Using the rechargable battery that came with the camara, I took more than 330 pictures, maybe 50 of them used flash. The battery still not dried up before I quit!<br />I own this baby for more than 6 month. Yesterday I bought a 128 MB compactflash memory from amazon. Now I realize it is too much for this camara. It can store 206 pictures with 1800 X 1200 resolution. Boy!<br />The only drawback of this camara is the delay between shots. First 3 only delay 3 seconds, but after that, needs about 25 seconds to process.<br />Other than that, it is perfect.","Back around Thanksgiving, 2000, I bought this camera through Amazon.  I have enjoyed it much and definitely like it better than my wife's 35mm camera.<br />You can develop hardcopy photos 4X6's through Kodak for $ each and they have looked great for me so far.  Mostly though I just keep the photos on my computer or send them in emails to friends.  2 Megapixels makes for great looking photos and allows me to crop or re-size them to make jpeg files that fit my 19 inch monitor's resolution and that still look very good.<br />I like it that you can see your photo instantly on the small display screen, although it is pretty small and still hard to see if you caught that smile.<br />Also there are no processing costs or time spent waiting for processing as you can use your USB port.  It takes about a second per photo to download to your computer.  I did have problems with the USB with my old computer that would cause it to reboot and then work, but now my new Windows2000 PC works excellent with the Kodak camera and USB.<br />The 8MB card that comes with it is too small in storage capacity, and I am planning to get a 32MB very soon. The 8MB card holds at minimum 12 high res photos.<br />There is about a one second delay between when you push the button and when the camera flashes the photo, so you have to wait and hold the camera still so it is not so good for moving objects or sports events.<br />Also the zoom is good but not good enought for the sports events I go to for great distant shots.  The zoom lenses broke on my first Kodak 280 and they sent me a new one the same day I sent they old one back.<br />So overall the experience has been very good with this camera and I have alot of great photos to prove it.","Does anyone know if this camera has a timer setting so you can set it up and take pictures automatically?","This is the first digital camera I have ever purchased and with so many choices on the market I was very concerned about deciding which camera was the best for me.  After reading all the reviews on Amazon.com I decided on the Kodak DC 280 and what a GREAT choice.<br />The camera is VERY easy to use.  I am digital camera stupid and even I was taking pictures within 10 minutes of opening the box.<br />MEMORY.  I took the advice of most reviewers and bought a 32MB flash card.  A very good decision which I highly recommend.  What none of the reviews told me was that the 32MB card holds about 50 pictures when you have the camera on the highest reslution.  If you go for medium or lower resolution you of course get a lot more. I just use my camera for everyday pictures and the 32 MB card is just fine.<br />SOFTWARE.  You must have software to download the pictures from the camera.  The DC 280 comes with Kodak's camera control software, a very simple picture manipulation software called Arcsoft, and Adobe's photodeluxe 2.0 and Adobe pageMill 3.0.  The Arcsoft program is baby simple and I was using it with no problem to do my first picture downloads.  It even lets you do basic picture manipulation.  If you just want to take pictures for everyday memories or internet postings then this is all the software you will ever need.  I was a little scared that the PhotoDeluxe software would be to complicated to use so I didn't download it till last week.  Turns out It too is a piece of cake to operate and its much more powerful than the Arcsoft software. I now use the Photodeluxe software over the Arcsoft. Bottomline, the software that comes with the camera is VERY easy to use and unless you are a big time or serious photographer its all the software you need.<br />DONLOADING PICTURES.  I download pictures directly from the camera to the computer and its doable but slow, especially if you downloading the entire memory card.  My next purchase is to buy one of those flash card readers which other reveiwers recommend.<br />BATTERIES.  The camera comes with one set (4) rechargeable batteries and a recharger.  I would definately get a second set of rechargeable batteries, but not another recharger.  As long as you have one set of batteries ready to go you will be fine.  And if you don't have any batteries recharged ready to go you can always use regular batteries.  If you take pictures using the normal and recommended \"Capture\" mode the batteries will last through an entire 32MB memory card - no problem. Plus they only take a couple of hours to recharge.<br />CHARGER.  If you do not get one of those flash card readers I would difinately buy the AC/DC adapter.  When you download pictures directly from the camea you are using up battery power.  It would be much easier to plug the adapter into the camera instead of having to change out batteries which typically happens to me somewhere in the middle of downloading my pictures.<br />CASE.  The camera doesn't come with a case and I wish I had one.  I would recommend you buy one.<br />BOTTOMLINE.  I recommend you buy this camera, a 32 MB memory card, a memory card reader, an extra set of rechargeable batteries, an AC/DC adapter, and a case.","I've done some research on the Kodak series, and this is the best value so far. There are very few good digital cameras in this price range...that have the features that I need. It has a 2 megapixel resolution, easy to use LCD display, and it uses a Compact Flash card. It's also fairly easy to use.<br />Did I mention the pictures? Wow. I used to have a Pansonic digital camera and it wasn't as good as this DC280, (okay, so it was only a 1.3 megapixel). The picture quality is excellent. I really don't have to modify the images, sharpen them, or adjust the lighting within Photoshop. I basically crop the pictures, and send them out.<br />A really nice add on was the rechargeable batteries and recharger that were included with the DC280. Of course, it came with 4 AA standard batteries, too. :-) You can also buy a lens adapter so you can add on different lenses, such as super wide angle and telephoto lenses.<br />A reviewer did mention that the LCD screen is in an awkward place, so your nose does smudge it quite a bit. Also, sometimes the lens cap falls off the camera lens, but it is attached to the camera at least, so at least you won't lose it.<br />I purchased a 64 MB compactflash card to replace the 8 MB card that came with it. You should try to purchase it on-line... Amazon had it cheaper. I also bought a USB Compactflash card reader which was so much easier and faster to use than downloading the images from the camera (the DC280 also supports USB).<br />If Amazon doesn't have the camera in stock, you can find it at Buy.com--it'll take a few days to get it. I believe it's the previous model before the DC3400, so it might be difficult to find now...You're better off buying this on-line instead.","I bought this digital camera for use at work.  It has loads of features (optical AND digital zoom, exposure adjustments, ability to imprint custom borders / date & time stamp) that make it a versatile tool for business and personal use.<br />It's as easy to use as a point-and-shoot but steps up with advanced capability when needed.  Image resolution is great - takes exceptionally clear photos.  I use it at its' highest resolution and it gives me 11 images on an 8MB card, 25 images on a 16MB card.  USB connection makes downloading a breeze and makes it quick too!<br />Go for it - you'll enjoy this camera.","was to purchase the Kodak DC280.  We did a great deal of research before purchasing this camera, including reading reviews of many different digitals from customers on Amazon and other sites.  We quickly learned what the major issues of importance to us would be:  (1) picture quality; (2) battery life; (3) convenience/ease of use; and (4) overall value, considering 1-3.  We decided on the DC280 because of the features, above average customer reviews, and the price.<br />That said, we remained a bit concerned about battery life and convenience.  As you can see from all the reviews, digital cameras (this one included) have the reputation for eating batteries and we didn't want to trade film and development costs for battery expense and the hassle of always changing and buying them.  Take this as gospel:  if you do not use the LCD screen as a viewer to set up your shots, you will enjoy surprisingly long battery life.  We regularly snap more than 100 shots (a week's worth or more) and then pass the camera around to let everyone review them on the LCD screen.  The batteries last if you just take reasonable, minimal care, and with an extra set of rechargables you will probably never feel the crunch, even as snap-happy tourists on vacation somewhere.<br />Second, we had read that upper-end cameras (in the $600-1,000 range) could snap pictures rapidly one after another but that cameras such as the DC280 had an infuriatingly long lag time from one shot to the next--up to 12 to 15 seconds--while the camera processed and saved the data.  We braced ourselves for this inconvenience.  STUPID US!  It took two weeks before we realized by accident that you can take up to four or five pictures in very rapid succession before finding the need to cool it for a few seconds.  That is fine, and since we're not professionals needing to do rapid bursts for sports shots all day, we find no difference compared with how strenuously we used our film cameras (in fact, we get a whole lot more out of this one than our film cameras).<br />There is a lot more I could go on about, but the short of it is that this camera is amazing and has itself dispelled many falsehoods we read about cameras in its price range (and higher).  We have two little children and buying film, developing it, making duplicates, and mailing them out to family everywhere had become a real financial burden and hassle.  Consequently, we barely took any pictures anymore.  With the DC280 now, we have snapped more than 600 pictures in 5 weeks (the equivalent of 25 rolls, $250 for film and development).  Everyone in our family already has a CD with 500 pictures on it, with more on the way.  And we now have photos for our own collection that we otherwise would never have had.<br />If you have any doubts about which digital camera to choose anywhere near this price range, jump at this one before you miss out.  You'll love it.","I actually did the research and told my family what camera I wanted for my birthday.  I checked the reviews on Amazon and CNET.  I compared the specs against other cameras, most notably the small Canon's.  I decided on the Kodak DC280 and have been extremely pleased.<br />I can't complain about battery life or screensize like I read in other reviews.  I've played with all the settings by taking low light photos, close-ups, auto pictures, borders, etc.  When I send pictures to my subjects, they all comment on the quality of the photos.  The funny thing is that I'm taking pictures on medium quality with the lowest resolution!<br />I do wish that it was a little smaller, but I knew it would be larger than an Elph.  I would buy this camera again without hesitation.","I wanted to write a review of this camera because I hope it will help someone like myself that almost did not buy this great camera.<br />This was my first digital camera purchase. The reason I ultimately bought it was because it was a great value--including many extra items ( both 4 alkaline and 4 NiH rechargeable batteries, battery recharger, Adobe software, UBC Cord, etc.)that the others did not.  However, I was concerned because there were reviews that mentioned that the Adobe software was difficult to use and you could not e-mail pictures using it. Both negative comments were dead wrong.<br />First, I must say that the camera takes truely OUTSTANDING pictures.  It is also relatively easy to use.  The manual that comes with it is well written and easy to understand.  It comes with a quick-guide and you can literally be taking pictures within minutes.<br />The Adobe software is truely outstanding too.  Its only negative is it does not come with a manual so you have to plow through the instructions on the computer and very often use the help screen. However, you can make all kinds of adjustments to your pictures and come out with a first rate pictures.  I like to save the pictures to my hard drive in the JEP format. If I want to e-mail them, I simply  send the pictures as attachments from there.  No problem.<br />Regardless, the pictures and the software are great and any negative comments you may read from others probably are from first time buyers like myself who got frustrated with the learning curve and time it takes to get to know a new camera, new technology, how to use the software and how to print photographs.  For a novice, it takes considerable time to learn.  There are no shortcuts. However, once you get the hang of it, you get  fantastic results!!!<br />One mistake I made was buying a card reader.  I have a 800mh processor and the USB cable that comes with the camera literally takes seconds to transfer.  If you have a slow processor, you may need a card reader.<br />One thing  I definitely advise you to get is an AC adaptor.  It is a must or you will drain the batteries.  If you are going to go for a long weekend or plan to take a considerable number of pictures, you may want to buy both extra rechargeable batteries and an extra picture card.<br />Ihave a HP deskjet 952 printer.  I have found some Kodak 4X6 borderless print paper.  It comes with one or two pictures per page.  For the single page, I turn it upside down in my tray (with the Kodak name up) and locate it all the way to the far right.  I set the settings just the way the instructions say and I get the most unbelieveable pictures you can imagine.  Once I got the hang of it, people in my office asked me where I was getting them developed! Another major positive is that Kodak has a \"technical help desk.\" I called them a couple of times regarding how to use the new paper with my particular printer.  They have an 800 number,answered right away, and were incredibly helpful and knowledgable.  This was a major plus and helped me over several frustrating humps.<br />Regardless, this camera is a great value since it inclues many extras and provides outstanding quality pictures.  Beginers do need to invest time--and be forewarned it can get very frustrating but it all falls into place with time.  If you are on the fence, buy it.  You will love it!<br />Enjoy!!","This camera is great.  I took it out on the weekend, and took tons of pictures.  All the pictures came out so clear.  Everyone is complaining about the battery life, but that is normal w/ most digital cameras.  I basically took 90 + pictures on 8 double A's.  It already comes w/ 4 rechargable NIMH batteries.  Just buy another 4 pack (13 bucks) and your set for a long time.  I think that is more than plenty for the average user.  Furthermore, with the USB cable that it comes with, I was downloading so fast.  In addition, I bought a 64 mb compactflash card for this camera.  (note:  Make sure you buy compactflash and not smartmedia - size differences)  This allowed me to have 108 pictures of highest quality and resolution.  It was well worth it.","As this camera has been replaced by the 3400, it has fallen in price, but not in performance. In fact, it performs as well as its replacement, and costs a good bit less. For a 2 meg camera, it offers a great deal. It is well built, has great optics, a 2X true zoom, decent battery use, USB support and enough user controls to make it an acceptable camera for a semi-serious photographer. The resolution is more than adequate for internet apps and good enough for printing clear 8 x 10s. It is also very sturdy. I think that while supplies last, it is the best 2 meg around and would be an awesome Christmas present for almost anyone.","This was our first digital camera, and we did a lot of shopping around before we bought.  I love it.  The menus are very straight forward and easy to follow.  I like that you can take a picture the old fashion way, or you can use the LCD screen, which is great for close-up pictures.  The LCD helps you decide what picture to keep and what pictures to delete.  There are nice features such as, borders, black and white or sepia tone and date stamping.  And I can't forget the picture quality.  We are very happy with the sharpness of pictures. Excellent color pictures. If you are looking for a 2 mega pixel camera, with a great price, you will love this one!","This is my first digital camera and I am very pleased. I alsobought a H.P. printer for under ($). You loose some resolution with digital , but the color is astounding. More importantly you can crop and fix up pictures so that the photos you do print ( I do 2 on an 8 1/2 by 11) are perfect for a photo album. I also get clear plastic sleeves ( Office Max) that have holes for binder and protect picture.Also there is an abundance of on-line storage sites to park pictures you don't print ( Freedrive.com is one site). There is a learning curve with the software ( must save photos in jpeg format to e-mail), but it is not that difficult. The USB download capability is very important and makes downloading get done in under a minute. I had some fear after I bought it that I wouldn't be able to figure everything out, but I am very pleased one month into my ownership. You will need battery recharger and 4 extra batteries to rotate into camera, but this is not a significant cost. Again, the color resolution is outstanding and the ability to edit the photos ( crop, enhance, lighten or darken) allows for a lot of creativity. I am having a great time with it.","For the reliability and capacity of this camera, the pricecan't be beat.  We bought this ... last year.  We use it with ourWindows 98 machine, and the USB installation was a snap.  We use it totake a lot of pictures for our personal website.  The ultimatetestimonial; I showed it to my Dad - a short time later, he bought theexact same model.","I just received my DC280 and am very pleased....it was really easy to set up and I even found an interactive tutorial on the Kodak web site.  I also bought the viking Intelliflash USB Flash Memory Reader so I don't have to keep plugging in my camera to upload pictures.","The Kodak DC280 is very easy to use.  This is my first digital camera and I had read and heard that they could be difficult to use.  In no way was this true.  All you need to do is just follow the instructions and it works like a charm.  I use Windows ME and although the software that comes with the camera does not support it all I had to do was go to the Kodak site and after a quick download of the ME software it works without a hitch.  The Adobe PhotoDeluxe software that comes with the camera is also easy to install, has many features for changing your pictures, fixing mistakes, adding special effects, etc.  Once I got everything installed I was able to take a picture, download it and enjoy it all in less time than it will take to read this review and thats on my FIRST try!  This camera is easy to use, has lots of great features, comes with very usable software and just overall makes it easy for the Digital Camera Newbie.","I chose the Koday DC280 based on reviews. CNET made it one of their best picks. The camera arrived two days before the birth of my grandson so I had very little time to learn how to use it before I started taking pictures in the hospital. It didn't matter. The camera was really easy to use and the results were amazing. The pictures actually seem sharper than ordinary film photgraphs. I've been using the medium quality, high resolution mode which gives me seventeen pictures on the 8MB card. So far I've blown the pictures up to 5X7 and they have great detail. When my grandson was 4 days old, I took some more pictures and used the built-in \"new baby\" frame feature. People could not believe the professional quality of the prints. By the way, I am using an HP 932C DeskJet printer with HP glossy paper with excellent results. I do find the HP Photo Printing software easier to use than the Adobe Photo Deluxe software that came with the camera. In net, the Kodak DC280 is a great bargain.","I shopped extensively all over the internet and could not find a better value than this camera from Amazon. It takes wonderful pictures, even on the lowest resolution settings. It's very easy to use and compact. I had a USB conflict with the camera but Kodak Tech. Support resolved it expeditiously. The only drawbacks are minor.. Kodak could have spent a little more time on the lense cap design, as it comes off easily and a regular neck strap would be better than the hand strap. My recommendations are to upgrade to at least an additional 20mb flash card, consider an extra set of rechargeable batteries and possibly a card reader. Even without the above, the camera functions solidly. You can even view your photos on your TV in a slide show with the provided cable! I would not hesitate to recommend this camera to anyone.","I thought I had read all information about this product prior to purchase it. A good thing: its very nice LCD and menu interface. Two bad things: USB seems no working on my Intel D815EEAAL motherboard, and it renders awfull colors and details when trying to take pictures of flowers and plants (that's why I bought it). Thou its macro feature is fine, it seems the camera cannot balance colors when the composition is very colorful. It has customizable and automatic white balance option that behave weird, and your setting is not saved on the preferences, it changes to \"automatic white balance\" each time you turn it on. I think its a great camera for fancy pictures, portraits or any image with diversified colors.","I thought I had read all information about this product prior to purchase it.

This camera gave me good results on a recent trip to Europe.<br />* the battery life is just fine if you are good about turning off the camera.  I took over 80 photos before I needed to change the batteries, and was not too stingy with the review mode.  That is not great but certainly not as bad as I was led to beleive.<br />*  the little screen does get smudged with your nose a lot, unless you are super careful.  Get used to it.<br />* The software isn't that great, but there are a lot of shareware or freeware programs out there to look manipulate pictures with.<br />* The camera is not very good for action shots, but that was not a major issue with me.<br />* the camera is a little bit big, compared to say the Canon Elph, but not really too big or heavy.<br />This camera is very good value for the money, I might even rate it higher depending on the relative price of a few other cameras.  Overall I was extremely pleased with the quality of the pictures from my DC 280, and my wife was quite impressed with the picture quality as well.  I only wish it had a little more optical zoom ability, a burst mode, and more memory.","I have owned this camera for two weeks -- waited six months to buy it, tracking reviews and comparing to other digitals in this price range.  For the price this is a solid performer, and appears to have most of the features of its newer 3400 version.  It is a a very good value.  For me it was important to have a camera that provided USB connection to my computer.  It makes uploading a breeze.","Have had the camera for over a week and have taken many pictures with it. The photo quality is great!! The only problem I see with it so far is that the adobe software that comes with it is very confusing and the instructions are nonexistant. I went as far as to uninstall all the adobe and just use my printer photo software to view and edit. The adobe software also eats up so much of your computer's memory, I can not run it properly. If you are going to use a cardreader instead of direct input from the camera, the kodak software is useless. I am trying to get info from kodak to see if their software is usable with the reader\"sandisk\".  All in all the camera is the best one I tried and I tried many of them...","I've used 6 or so digital cameras before, but this is the first one that I bought.  Before I go on, let me warn you that this model has been replaced by the Kodak 3400.  However, I see no significant improvement and they include less in the box with the 3400 (no rechargeable battreries).<br />Let me talk about the camera.  It is very simple to use, yet includes the essential features for all but the most serious photographers.  The annoying feature that makes me give this a 4 star rating is the location of the LCD screen - I found that if I use my right eye (which is my dominant eye) in the viewfinder that my nose touches the LCD screen and smudges it.  Come on Kodak, that was a goof.  This does not effect the quality of piuctures, its just annoying until you realize that it is a hopeless battle to keep the LCD clean.<br />Other than that, it is terrific.  I immediately purchased a Sandisk 32 meg compactflash card, and have since ordered a 128 mb card ....  Battery life is long (I do use the power save mode, which is not on by default).<br />A few tips.  Once you experience digital photography you'll discover that, just like videos, things work best without flash unless you absolutely need it.  Also, this does have a limited telephoto power with just a 2x optical lens - not a problem for me, but you need to know what you want (if you want much more than 2X, I think you should look at an SLR model).<br />Buy this one, its a great value.","We purchased the camera and received it the night before we left for a two week vacation in Europe.  Without a lot of time to learn about the camera before using, we found it very easy to get started with.  There are many ways to conserve battery power.  We also bought 64meg of extra memory, which I recommend.  At medium quality the camera indicated that it would hold 158 pictures with the 64meg card.  We took 147 on 1 set of batteries.  We are very pleased with the quality of the picture even at medium quality.  The software is not the easiest, but allows you to do the basics with some practice.","I just received this camera last week. It took almost no time to figure it out and start shooting. With 2.1 megapixels, the quality is terrific. If you want to see samples, I'll email them to you. Just write me at davidwalsh@home.com, so I can show off my grandson!","I love this camera!  Shipped with USB cable and the transfers are super fast.  Photo quality is excellent, and I was taking photos only minutes out of the box.  The trouble started when I loaded the Adobe PhotoDeluxe 1.0 that shipped with the camera-- I can't seem to transfer photos to email, and frankly, this is the major need of the camera for me.  In fact, when I try to transfer to email, the program locks up and so does my computer, which was 192 megs of RAM and Pentium II at 350.  So, buy the camera if you want ease of use and great photos, but watch out for the Adobe software.  If I can't get this fixed, it's all going back.","I'm not a novice when it comes to digital cameras.  This is my third, and it is, by far, the finest digital I've ever seen.  To me, a good camera is one that takes good pictures.  That makes the 280 a remarkable camera, because the output is truly remarkable.  With a good printer, the photos from the Kodak DC280 rival those of the finest 35 mm cameras. If I wanted to be \"picky,\" I could fault this camera for short battery life, but I don't.  The answer to that criticism is simple.  Carry a set of extra rechargeable batteries, and You'll be prepared for that once in a lifetime shot when it presents itself.  I recommend this camera with no hesitation.","I did a lot of research before I bought the DC-280 and the thing that sold me was the reviews of faithful color reproduction. I have not been disapointed. It takes great pics indoor and out. I can even tell you it is rugged. After falling to the floor off a counter top it still performed flawlessly. The colors are vivid, the light range is quite good and it is simple to operate. I recommend a second set of rechargable batteries and a second flash memory card.","I've used mine for a year in all sorts of situations..including on the slopes during a ski trip.  Photographic output couldn't be better.  I wish it had someway to attach a neck strap like most 35 mm cameras.  Shortly after I got it it quit working and I took it to a Kodak service center.  Turned out I had shoved the batteries into the compartment too firmly and bent the metal \"leaves\" inside which maintain pressure on the battery.  They were \"unbent\" in 2 shakes and all has been well since.  The service department STRONGLY recommended using LITHIUM AA batteries like the red-topped Energizers.  Since I switched, it's months before I get a low battery reading.","I too read reviews, searched the web,compared features, and priced the various models.  I did not want to spend a small fortune on my first Digital Camera, but yet I didn't want to buy a bare bones model, then curse myself that \" I should have bought...\"  I knew I wanted Zoom, and at least 1.3 pixels, and the one that fit all my requirements was the DC280.  I know there are other cameras with better color, but no zoom, or better zoom, but costs more, or......etc.  The plus factors are..... EASE OF USE, NON-COMPLICATED, GREAT CUSTOMER SUPPORT, GREAT WARRANTY, AND GREAT PRICE, GREAT ACCESSORY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE.  Negative factors.....lens cover could be a better fit & quality, and LCD display seems to get smugged easily....... I DO SUGGEST THAT YOU CONSIDER PURCHASING THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS: 1. KODAK CAMERA CASE ( I got mine for $17.00 ) 2. BATTERY RE-CHARGER 3. EXTRA BATTERIES 4. AC ADAPTER ( got mine for $20.00) 5. SANDISK CARD READER ( GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD)...YOU SLIP THE CARD INTO THE READER AND PRESTO..THE PHOTOS ARE DOWNLOADED INTO YOUR COMPUTER.( SOLD FOR USB,SERIAL OR PARALLEL PORT CONNECTIONS, AND FOR FLASH CARD OR SMART CARD DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR CAMERA USES).The reader sits on you desk, so you don't have to go looking for your camera cables, or fool around with your tower all the time.......( got mine for $32.00)  I get great color prints ( up to 8x10 ) and super detail, both on the computer and printed on Photo paper.  I even went out and bought the Kodak/Lexmark Personal Picture Maker PM100 printer that has the flash card port built right into the printer, and the printer DOES NOT EVEN NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE COMPUTER TO PRINT OUT THE PHOTOS!...","I've had the DC280 for about six months and overall I am very pleased with my purchase.  Let me begin by saying there is no better camera package out there for the price.<br />Best features:  The picture color is excellent; camera controls are very logical and easy to use; uploading to a computer is a breeze: 4x6 prints look like 35mm prints but 5x7 start to get grainy.<br />Okay features:  Zoom is decent, nothing a few steps forward can't cure; and battery life is short so keep an extra set around and buy the optional A/C adapter for uploading.<br />Needs improvement:  The picture size is too long or too short which ever way you want to look at it.  I end up having to cut off the ends to make a printable 4x6, so the picture is actually 1.7 mega pixels instead of 2.0; the auto flash gets confused easily and I find myself having to use the manual flash and risking red-eye;  the software needs a lot of improvement, it's not user friendly and crashes my computer now and then... but it's free; action pictures come out fuzzy and many great shots have been lost becasue they were out of focus.<br />This camera has been great and I would recommend it to anyone.  It's not perfert, but pretty close...","With this camera, you will get great colors on your screen.  I tryed the same picture with the three different qualities and with all I got excellent pictures.  It has all the basic features you might need in any camera.  It has a good zoom, the 'physical zoom' is not that good, then I discovered the digital zoom which is great.<br />It consumes a lot of batteries, but you have more than enough with the rechargable batteries and of course, the battery charger included in the camera.  I bought an additional charger because I never found that the camera came with its own,  so don't buy another charger.<br />I'm more than satisfied with the 8MB flash card.  It is true that you can only take 12 pictures with the highest resolution (1800x1600) and higest quality, but with standard resolution(800x600) and the medium quality you still have very good pictures and can get about 52 pictures, which is good for a weekend.  If you have a long trip and don't have a pc to download the pictures, then you might consider another flash card.<br />BAD THINGS:  It weights a little bit more than a traditional camera of the same size, but still, it's much better that other big cameras. It doesn't come with a camera bag.  You have to buy it appart.<br />In summary,  a great camera.","I bought the Kodak DC280 in October, 1999, when it came with a20mb compact flash card, rechargeable batteries and a recharger ... .  It has been great.  I take it with me everywhere.  It is super easy to use.  Having an extra set of rechargeable batteries is a must.  I definately recommend this camera, ... .  ... I've taken over 1200 pictures with the camera, mostly in the mountains while hiking and snowboarding, and have been very impressed with the quality.  The lens cap is attached to the camera, so you never have to worry about lossing it.","The Good:  Picture Quality, Camera ease-of-use.<br />The Bad:  File Transfer from camera to hard drive.<br />The Ugly:  Adobe PhotoDeluxe that comes with the camera.<br />Overall, because of the great picture quality, I give it 3/5 stars.","In my opinion DC280 is near the best point-and-shoot camera for the most applications.<br />Good:<br />- Excellent color reproduction - I think DC280 produces better colors than ANY digital camera;<br />- Very good consistent results under various lighting conditions - indoor, outdoor, flash, no flash, whatever;<br />- Decent flash;<br />- Good lens - sharp enough and absolutely distortion free(! ) - all competitors zoom lens produce more or less barrel/pincusion distortion;<br />- Good design, solid build quality;<br />- Stylish look and feel :)<br />Bad:<br />- Poor nigth shots (longest exposure is 1/2s) - forget about capturing night city lights (though I was able to shoot some acceptable pictures of the fireworks and even the lightning bolt);<br />- Limited macro capability (mimimal focusing distance is 25cm);","I finally upgraded from my original 2 year old Digital Camera - a Casio 5000SX that was great except for a poorly designed battery door. The Kodak DC280 Zoom is better in every category - clarity, features, memory capability, analog zoom, except for one - the delay in the time from pressing the shutter until it snaps the picture. Keep in mind, that the processing time is quite fast - the Kodak is ready to take your next picture quite quickly, thanks to some in-memory processing, but the delay from when you click the button until the action is captured is quite lengthy. I find it nearly impossible to get good action shots with this camera. For example, I take quite a few pictures of sand volleyball on my weekends. Only the highest flyers - the guys that can jump out of the sand and hang like Vince Carter were captured in the air, and only with me clicking the shutter button at least 2-3 seconds *before* they jumped. However, if you don't have to take a lot of action shots, well this this is an excellent camera for the money - for both amateur and professional alike.","I was amazed by the beautiful colors and clarity of this camera, even in  the medium quality level. I used the camera for vacation photos and then  sent them to an online photo processor to have them printed on photo paper.  I couldn't have received better quality with my high-end 35mm. Not only was  the quality equal, I was able to crop out the undersirable elements before  I had them printed! VERY IMPRESSED!","I had narrowed my digital camera search down to the Fuji Finepix and the  Kodak DC280 since I wanted one in the $450 range, and was impressed with  the resolution and compactness of a friend's Fuji camera. Since I was only  able to view the cameras over the internet, I chose the Kodak since I  figured the better resolution and features would be worth the extra $50.  But after receiving it, I realise that I would have gone with the Fuji  Finepix had I seen the Kodak in person. The Kodak is much bulkier, and the  lens cap has to be manually replaced and is easily knocked off the minute  you put it in your backpack (actually the stupid thing is always falling  off!). I reckon for the better price, the resolution of the Fuji is  perfectly adequate, and the slimness of the Fuji and it's sliding lens  cover are very convenient. Go with the Fuji!","Resolution quality is fantastic for the Amazon.com price.  It comes with  battery charger which is a must.  I print great 8x10 pictures.  If you want  to take many high resolution picture, order an extra memory card.","I am very pleased with the camera.  It is a nicely designed camera that  takes great pictures. The colors, resolution and exposure are all  excellent. The controls are easy to use and make the learning process swift  for this camera.  The only negatives I can think of is: 1) the battery life  is short and 2) while running high resolution you will only get about 12  frames with the included 8mb card. If you purchase this camera I would  recommend a higher capacity card and an extra set of rechargable batteries.  I have connected this camera to a Windows 98 machine (a snap) and to a  Windows NT machine (not recommended because NT doesn't support USB) and to  a Windows 2000 machine.  On Windows 98, the installation was a breeze and I  was up and running in no time.  On Windows 2000, I had a bit of trouble  getting the camera to work properly.  It will not work out of the box but  once you install the necessary patch from Kodak it works fine.  To Kodak's  credit they don't advertise the camera as 2000 compatible but it would be  nice if they would update their software or instructions for folks that  need to use the camera with a 2000 machine.  I have no problem endorsing  this camera for Windows 98 users.  It is a great camera.","I did extensive research on digital cameras and all fingers pointed to the  Kodak DC280!  I've only had this camera for a few weeks, but I'm already  certain that I made a great choice!  It's so simple to use and the  resolution quality is fantastic!  I've e-mailed several photos to friends  and they are all amazed at how clear and sharp they are!  All of the  reviews I read spoke of the wonderful resolution (that's what made me  decide on this camera) and they were right!!!  The photos download quickly  (via USB).  The camera controls are a snap to use.  The instruction manual  is easy to read.  I alternate between two sets of rechargeable batteries  and have no 'battery life problems.'  The DC280 is similar in size and  weight to my regular (35 mm) camera.  So far, the only 'negative' thing I  can say about this camera is that the LCD window does get constantly  smudged by my nose when looking through the viewfinder -- but it's really  no big deal.  Bottom line, it's a terrific camera!  I have a lot of fun  with it!  If you're looking for a moderately-priced digital camera, look  into the DC280.  I think you'll be glad you did!","I've wanted a good digicam for several years now and bought the DC280 in  May after doing a lot of research. I really had my eye on the Sony Mavica,  but the picture quality just didn't cut it compared to my little Kodak. I  LOVE THIS CAMERA! It's super easy to use and takes great low and high res  images. Do yourself a favor and get at least a 32MB Flashcard and you will  be one happy camper. The only downside to this camera is low battery life,  but an extra set of rechargeables solves that problem. The USB connection  is great and super-fast. This is a purchase that I am very, very happy  with. It was worth the wait and research effort!","After doing some thorough research I decided to purchase this camera. It  has several features which make it a great camera: sharp images, great  colours, very easy to use, comes with good software,small and light so  great for active travelers like myself. It is comparable to the DC 290 but  the price is much more attractive. I would recommend buying an extra memory  card (at least 16 MB).","I've had this camera for about two months and have taken over  500  pictures and couldn't be happier with its performance. Pictures taken  outdoors were exceptional in all respects (color, clarity and detail).  Pictures taken indoors are always more challenging due to lighting  conditions,  but the DC-280 has more than enough exposure compensation  adjustments for your use that there is  really no reason for bad picture  quality.  It does take a little practice to take consistently good indoor  pictures,  but it has a great owners/instruction manual that is very easy  to read and follow.<br />The rechargable batteries are a must with digital  cameras as these cameras draw a lot of current with the LCD monitor  activated.  I would also recommend purchasing a larger Compact  Flash Card,  as the one sold with the camera is only 8Mb.  I purchased an additional  32Mb card which now gives me enough capicity for many pictures (over 200 at  a medium resolution).<br />I have taken a number of pictures at the highest  resolution setting and proceeded to print them on my HP Photo quality  printer using Photo quality paper and have been delighted  with the  results.  I print most of them in the 5\" X 7\" format size and the  results have been amazing with virtually no  visable pixellation.  It is  very hard to tell these photos  from conventional film photography.  I have  also printed a  number 8\" X 10\" pictures with great results.<br />This is a great camera for a great price and it has my hearty  recommendation.","I bought this camera in February for a trip to Europe.  The pictures were  sharp.  The colors were accurate.  Unfortunately, I needed service, but  Kodak did a fast, great job.  I bought the 128MB compact flash card, which  gives me about 200 pictures in top quality.","This camera is a great camera. smaller then it looks on the box, but has  great flexibility and features built in. Produces excellent quality  pictures, the one flaw however that I've noticed is that when taking  pictures in doors in a low light level *without* the flash, it tends to  blur the image if it's either a motion picture or you move it before it's  finished. This only seems to occur without the flash (I was taking horse  action pictures and didn't want to scare them) and this seems to dissapear  at around 1/90 of a second exposure time. Just thought I'd be critical :)  Other then that I find this a great camera!","Not much to add to the very favorable reviews here: as a novice photographer, I'm delighted with my new 280. Take it out of the box, scan  through the instructions, point, zoom and shoot. The digital zoom works  fine, and the special effects (especially black and white) are fun.<br />Two  features of digital photography are an absolute joy: first, the ability to  review your shot right away, and discard it if it's not perfect (leading to  much higher quality end results without wasting lots of money on film); and  second, the way to drop the flashcard from the camera straight into a PDA  (I have an HP Jornada running Pocket PC) for an instant pocket photo  collection. This passes the stringent test of \"would have been science  fiction just a little while ago\".<br />Here's the word of warning: I have a  Dell laptop running Windows NT. The connection from the camera to the PC is  very erratic. Kodak's helpline support was very good - they advise lowering  the transfer rate on the COM1 port by forcing it not to find the camera (ie  disconnecting it and waiting for the dialog box). This does work, but means  you have to wait a long time for your photos. NT does not support USB, so  investing in a card reader is one solution; another is to drop the  flashcard into the PDA and transfer from the PDA to the PC. Hardly  satisfactory - a shame to let down such a great product this way.","An excellent camera which works well in African conditions. User friendly, light weight, convenient.  Instructions suitable for even a computor  illiterate husband. I use it for business and pleasure.  My only complaint  is with Kodak who do not have an internet sales service to South Africa.  Amazon.com does not offer all the accessories.  Come on chaps wake up to an  enormous market in Southern Africa - we are 1st world!","I purchased this camera back in May, and I love it.  Easy to use and well worth the money...My children love using the camera which is very easy for them to use.  One suggestion, you need to purchase a larger memory  card, other then that don't wait any longer........PURCHASE IT NOW !","Very happy with my Kodac DC280.  I did lots of comparisons and research on digital cameras before purchasing and feel I got the best deal here on  Amazon.com.  Would not trade it for the world.  Very happy with the  resolution.  Takes beautifully sharp, crisp pictures.  Software makes it  easy to use.  Overall a great camera and a great price!","Overall, this is an excellent camera and I've had nothing but great luck with it.  The pictures are terrific.<br />I had heard a lot about the DC280  and similar digital cameras chewing up batteries, so I bought an extra set  of rechargable NiMH batteries -- in addition to the set that comes with the  camera.  While this is still a good idea, I didn't find that the battery  life was particularly bad.  On a recent trip overseas, I shot over 150  pictures (many with flash) and still had good battery life when I got home  -- enough for another 75 pictures.  Just don't use the LCD preview screen  for every shot -- that's not what it's intended for, and it WILL kill your  batteries pretty quickly.<br />The real limitation is the Compact Flash  memory.  If you shoot the highest resolution possible, the camera will fill  a 8mb card (which is what is supplied) with only 9-12 pictures.  I  typically get 32 hi-res pictures from a 16mb card.  (The number of pictures  you get will vary depending on the complexity of the images you shoot.)  So, in addition to an extra set of rechargable batteries, think about  buying the highest capacity Compact Flash card you can afford!<br />If you're  thinking about getting a higher resolution camera than the DC280, keep in  mind that you'll get even fewer pictures per megabyte on your Compact Flash  cards.  Personally, I found enlargements up to 5x7 printed by Ofoto nearly  impossible to tell from film pictures.  I'd only recommend a 3 megapixel  camera if you intend to print 8x10s regularly.<br />A USB Compact Flash card  reader is a great option, too.  It saves the camera battery and allows you  to quickly download your pictures without tying up the camera.","I am a beginner to digital photography and this camera has me hooked. It is easy to learn, easy to use, and produces beautiful pictures. Congrats to Kodak for including the charger with batteries, and the regular batteries  so I was able to take pictures as soon as the camera arrived. Congrats also  to Amazon for having the best price I could find on the web. The software  works well but I wish Kodak had included the home version of Adobe instead  of the business version. This camera is a definite winner and I highly  recommend it to both the beginner and experienced photographer.","Overall I love this camera. Picture quality is awesome. If you turn off the LCD preview feature, I've found my batteries to last a long time. Get the carrying case and pack along an extra set just in case  though.<br />Cameras are coming now with only 8mb cards, so make sure you get  a bigger card to hold hi-res photos. The 8mb does only about 12 hi-res  pictures. Get batteries, get the AC adapter as well.<br />Kodak just released  Win2000 drivers also.<br />Unfortunantly, my camera died the other day. Lost  power. It's being sent back to Kodak for repairs. Hopefully I won't have  any more problems with it. It comes with a 1 year warranty.","This is a remarkable camera, not because of the features, but because the pictures it produces.  This is actually my third digital camera. Prior to the Kodak 280 zoom, I had a Canon A5, followed by a Canon A50 zoom.  I  bought the Kodak 280 zoom on a lark, after reading that the pictures were  stunning.  They are.  I've been printing 8 by 10's that are absolutely  remarkable.  I couldn't be more pleased.  I would recommend this camera to  anyone.  The only fault I can find is that the camera eats batteries, but  I'll gladly trade the inconvenience of charging and changing batteries for  the quality prints this camera produces, inside and outside.  It's a little  marvel.","I have taken over 200 pictures so far and I have only had this camera for a few days!  The pictures are unbelievably clear, sharp and of course Kodak colors!  I am using the standard resolution (896x592) with the best  quality setting, I am able to store 32 pictures on the included 8MB compact  flash card. I haven't experienced the battery drain as other users have  mentioned; I am even using the LCD extensively to compose the picture.  I  enjoy the fact Kodak has included 4 AA alkalines(to get you started) and 4  AA nimh rechargeables plus charger with the camera, in comparison - the  Canon S10...you have to spend an additional $90-$100 to get the  rechargeable proprietary battery and charger.<br />This is a outstanding  camera for the money and Amazon has the best price I have found (and I  searched a long time) on the DC280!","I compared this camera to the five others owned by members of my family and found it to be on par with the best of them and significantly less expensive than most.  It has performed flawlessly thus far (about 300  shots).  I highly recomend it. The supplied memory card is too small  however, most users will want to purchase additional memory to extend their  capabilities.","I spent 2 weeks shopping on-line for a digital camera for our department at work and found the DC280 Zoom to be the best bargain, by far. After purchasing the camera for $447, I kept seeing the camera in stores and in  ads going for $600+! The metal hydride rechargeable batteries are a great  addition, though the camera doesn't come with a case or an AC adapter.  But  that's okay, 'cause I ended up purchasing the accessory kit as well, which  has a case, AC adapter, and 4 more metal hydride rechargeable  batteries.<br />The camera and software is so easy to use, and the 8 MB  Compact Flash card holds plenty of pictures at moderate resolution and  quality. I just took some great nighttime photos; the flash and timer work  extremely well. The USB connection also allows quick transfer of pictures  to the computer. This camera is easy to use, and Kodak delivers tremendous  quality for this fabulous price.","The Kodak DC280 is exactly what a serious SOHO user or amateur photographer should be looking at as their bottom-line diigital camera. I researched and waited for ages for the right combination of features and  price to come available. When I saw the DC280 for $447.00 (compared to the  near-$700 it was a few months ago), I knew the time was right and pulled  the trigger...<br />Everything I need in a personal/professional camera is  basically here. The photo quality at top resolution is beyond anything  you'd expect. When people see a photo from the DC280 printed on the HP970C,  they are taken aback at how good it really looks. One of the greatest  sources of differentiation in the quality of film camera output lies in the  quality of the paper that was used. I have hundreds of family photographs  from the 1940's to 1999, which vary widely in how clear they look. But no  matter how good the best studio photographer's shot looks, it cannot  surpass the clarity of the DC280's best pictures.<br />The DC280 is not a  perfect camera. There are saturation problems, as well its greedy use of  batteries. The 8MB FlashCard that comes included has to be one of the  reasons the camera is so inexpensive, along with there not being any AC  adapter included.<br />The Kodak software works perfectly in Windows 2000, but  is flakey in Windows 98 SE. However, one hidden bonanza came to light when  I used ThumbsPlus 4.1 to acquire the images off the camera; you can save  them as lossless TIFF files instead of the default JPEG files that the  camera uses.<br />This camera will help my business and will help me be as  creative as I want to be. It was worth every penny I spent. You should give  it a try as well...","This is a great camera. It takes pics that are as good as high end cameras costing twice as much. However it only cost alittle bit more than some low end priced cameras.  A few people have complained that this camera uses up batteries too much, but this is common for all cameras that have a LCD view  screen. If you keep the view screen turned off when you dont need it will  increase the battery life.  Get a recharger and that will save you money in  the long run. Kodak sells a charger with batteries on Amazon for $39. Amazon has most discount stores and web site  stores prices for this camera beat by a big margin.  This camera is a great  value!","Finally took the plunge with into the digital world. While I'm not quite ready to retire a couple thousand dollars worth of Nikon Equipment, you can bet my wife's point-and-shoot days are over. The image quality for this  price is outstanding (kudo's to Amazon for blowing away the competition on  price). I added a 48 MB CF memory card, enough for about 70 shots at the  highest resolution. You'll want to do the same since the 8 MB included  isn't nearly enough.  I've tried transfers via both USB to Win 98 (cable  included) or serial to Win NT (ditto). USB is obviously the way to go, but  serial is tolerable.<br />Then I use any editing software (a version of Adobe  Photo Deluxe is included and not bad, but I like MS PhotoDraw 2000) to  resize, color-fix, etc. You can go nuts manipulating the pictures, but odds  are you won't need to. I've used the camera in bright sun, low-light and  everything in between and haven't been able to fool it yet.<br />Cool nifty  feature - the self running slide show. Hook it up to your PC, or even a TV  or VCR (again, cable included), and you can let the camera scroll through  all the shots on your memory card. My 2 year old loves watching it, and it  beats Barney, right? One tip - get an AC adapter if you plan to spend much  time hooked up to your PC/MAC or TV. No sense wasting precious battery  juice when you don't have to.<br />Complaints? The flash, viewfinder, and  light sensors all line up right where I want to put my fingers, so I'm  re-learning how to hold a camera. Also, there's a brightness dial on the  bottom of the camera for the LCD display. I always seem to slide it  accidentally. The result looks like a thermo-scan of Junior and Fluffy in  the back yard, but it's only the LCD. The image itself is still fine.<br />For the price of a good 35 MM camera body, get yourself a great digital  companion or primary camera. Now if we could just get Nikon to make a  digital camera that takes all my old lenses for under $1,000...","For the money you just simply will not beat the performance of the Kodak DC280.  I have had mine for a couple of months now, and it has literaly replaced my regular 35 mm camera.  I love the convience of taking pictures  then making any edits i need from my computer.  The software is easy to  install, and only has about a one hour learning curve to master.  Very good  and fast usb connection.  With a fully charged set of NI-MH, AA batteries  it gets fantastic long life.  And the 2.0 Megapixel image is nothing less  than photo film perfect, must be seen to belive.  I also like the smart  card memory media included, I have upgraded the 8 mb, to a 24 mb card, and  on the 24 mb, I can snap over 100 photos in the best quality mode on the  lower size setting, and 34 of the highest quality photos in the huge mega  resolution setting.  Another great feature is that this camera is very easy  to use compared to the other brands I have tried.  I did not even have to  read the instructions,  (though I would read them if I were a beginer).  Try the Kodak DC280 out if your in the market for a fantastic digital  camera!","The camera produces excellent pictures, but has some usability problems. For a two-megapixel camera, the price is excellent. The usability problems vary in seriousness. The power switch has only one resting position and  hence doesn't indicate the power-up status of the camera. There is a  power-saving mode, but no power-down after a period of inactivity. The lens  cap is an old fashioned plastic disk that must be manually placed over the  lens; even my old QuickTake 150 had an integrated power switch and lens  cap. The unit also struck me as being rather heavy. The interface to  Windows computers is excellent. Retrieving photos is as easy as opening a  volume that automatically mounts on the computer. Particularly useful is a  camera control application that makes for easy adjustment of all the  camera's settings. Mac users are not so fortunate. Pictures must be  retrieved with a special Picture Transfer Application with an exceptionally  bad interface and inexcusably slow operation. There is no camera control  application for the Macintosh. The camera has some formatting features such  as borders and special effects. It also provides for video output. I  haven't tested these features and can't comment on their usefulness.","After several months of research and a friend with a Kodak 265, I decided to buy the 280. I am very pleased with the overall quality of the pictures. The red eye feature does a better job then the point and shoot 35 mm I had  before.<br />Battery life is better than I had expected, I have taken over 200  pictures, and only charged the batteries once. The camera came with a  charger and one set of rechargeable batteries, so there have been no extra  costs.<br />Picture quality seems great so far. I have ordered prints online  from my digital pictures, and they look great, even the 5x7.<br />The zoom is  a little lacking, so if you use a zoom lens all the time, this may not be  the camera for you, but Kodak does make an adaptor to go to 4x.<br />I am very  pleased with my purchase here on Amazon.com.","Have you ever taken Kodachrome slides - the color saturation is upped a little, as is the contrast; everything is a little realer than real.  And why not. Kodak has had most of a century learning how to reproduce color,  and they have applied it to their new-fangled digital cameras.  You will  not believe what you see on the screen of your computer monitor - can a  digital camera really be this good?  It looks like a Kodachrome slide -  heck, it looks better!<br />Printing is another thing.  The reason pro  photographers and serious ameteurs have preferred slides is because the  range of contrast is much greater than prints - prints can only reflect  light, not generate it, as can a slide projector or computer monitor.  So a  great deal is lost in going to prints in terms of light; and as even your  basic printer can print at 300 dpi, the lower resolution of the digital  camera makes its effects felt.  However, I find 8x10 prints at the highest  resolution of the DC280 quite acceptable (using a HP832c).  But the camera  cannot make uncompressed files - all files are JPEG compressed to some  extent, and the artifacts may show.<br />  This is a point and shoot camera;  no control of focus, shutter speed, or aperture is possible. The camera is  a little heavy, and you wish for hooks for a neck strap. You wish for more  buttons on the body of the camera, rather than having to go through levels  of menus.  The lens front is very vulnerable (and the lens cap is not  automatic) - it would be wise if the lens were protected by a protruding  metal or plastic guard, as some of Kodak's competitors do.<br />I find the  battery life using Kodak's supplied metal hydride batteries quite  acceptable, particularly if you buy a second set; but the supplied  alkalines lasted only through the evening I bought the camera.<br />I am a  wide angle person rather than a telephoto person, but in an ideal world, a  3x rather than a 2x would be welcome - 60mm (equiv.) is hardly telephoto.  This is basically a wide angle to normal lens.<br />I've been a darkroom  photographer since 1952, and a sometime professional since 1959 - I am  delighted to see the end of chemical photography, with its dangerous  chemicals and the near impossibility for amateurs of getting good results  in color.  Now all you need is a digital camera and an ink-jet printer.  Prices are falling - give it a try!","We love it!  It is simple to use, versatile, and takes fantastic pictures!  Before we purchased it, we were a little bit uneasy about the comments we had read about the 'short' battery life.  The camera has numerous battery  saving features which can be employed when prolonging the life of the  batteries is an issue.  It isn't that difficult to carry an extra set of  batteries just in case.  The AC adapter is a must for use during  downloading and viewing as a way to perserve battery life.  We're just  amazed at all of the things this camera can do and how easy it is to use!  I'd give it 6 stars if I could!","Although it sometimes feels like we're all still beta testing various digital imaging technologies, including digital cameras, products like the Kodak DC280 make me believe the \"dark ages\" might be coming to an  end.<br />This is a good mid-range digital camera, perfect for those who want  to capture images that will look very good on the Web. The biggest plus of  the camera is image quality; this is the best camera in this price range  that I tested, with two-megapixel resolution. Having quite a bit of  hands-on experience with various Sony cameras, I and my partner were  actually stunned by how clear the DC280's images were in a variety of  lighting conditions.<br />There is very little to complain about in terms of  interface and usability. I scanned the manual, and then just started using  the DC280. The menu system and buttons are quite intuitive. One minor  quibble is that one is pretty much forced to use the DC280's viewfinder  left-eyed; otherwise the LCD screen smudge factor so common to digital  camera will rear its ugly head. However, I use the LCD for the majority of  my shooting, so this isn't a huge factor.<br />The DC280 uses a USB connection  to transfer images to your computer. The camera mounts as if it were a hard  drive, and one can preview large thumbnails of images before copying them  over to your hard drive. While I was able to open the images directly into  Photoshop, Fireworks couldn't get into the camera; this may have been a  problem with how I have my file associations set up, however.<br />The camera  comes with a number of features and extras. The bundled software, Adobe's  PhotoDeluxe and Pagemill, are more than adequate for editing images and  creating Web pages. Various simple visual effects and borders can be  applied in-camera, and you can run a slide-show right out of the camera  using the supplied video cable.<br />The DC280 includes four rechargeable AA  batteries, a recharger, and four AA alkaline batteries. You can get started  right out of the box. My camera sucked the alkalines dry after about 50  photos and a couple of downloads; I would suggest buying an extra set of  rechargeables to carry around with you, and an AC adaptor.<br />This is not  the perfect camera for all applications. For one thing, there are few  manual controls on the camera for focus, aperture or shutter priority, and  the optical zoom limited to 2X.  This will mean that photo enthusiasts  might want to look at something the next step up, such as the wacky-looking  Nikon Coolpix 950. As others have reported, low-light shooting is not at  the quality that one would hope for from a camera at this level.<br />All-in-all, the DC280 is an excellent camera for the price, perfect for  Web photos.","Within 10 minutes (thanks to the included batteries) I was taking photos.  The camera's interface is clear and understandable.  I suppose if you're challenged by a disposable camera, you might not get it, but if you are a  normal human, you can do this.  On the PC side, if you can open a file in  Word/Wordperfect, you can get to your photos.  With the USB interface, it  was more plug-and-play (emphasis on play) that I'd expected.  I expected an  hour or two to learn the \"how to's\", but hey, this is easy.  I'm  a LAN manager and ex-semi pro photographer in college, so I was less than  enthusiastic when my wife said we should get one.  But now that we have it,  I love the instant gratification that the DC 280 has.  Yes, the resolution  is not as good as film, but unless you're a real pro or have a need for  prints larger than 8x10, who cares?  I'm filling up my digital photo album  so quickly that I'm gonna need a CD burner.  Ok, bad stuff: your nose (if  you're right eye'd like most) smudges the LCD.  If you use it a lot, you'll  need more batteries but so do other cameras.  Hmm.. that's about it.  Last  words-I have no hesitation giving this camera a \"buy\"  recommendation.  Or in the words of the stock market gurus: \"Market  outperform\".","I bought this camera a month ago.  My wife normally will behead anyone she attempts to photograph, but after a week with her family, she came back with a card full of wonderful pictures!  She flipped through the manual and  took of with it.  Setting up the software was a breeze.  (Even if you  don't buy this one, get one with USB support.)  The camera shows up as a  device in Explorer, so you can look at the pictures instantly, only  downloading the ones you want. The pictures print at 5 x 7 with crisp  resolution.  We were replacing a well-loved Yashica 35mm that was stolen,  and thought a digital would be nice. I researched different models, picking  this one based on the CNET reviews and desired features.  After a month, I  could not be more pleased!  The one I bought was advertised on the web  with a 20MB flashcard.  It arrived with an 8 MB card.  I phoned the vendor,  they said their website was incorrect, but they sent me the 20 mb card  anyway.  I do recommend that you purchase a card with more capacity than  the 8 MB that is now standard.  A PCMCIA flashcard interface is nice if  you use a notebook PC that doesn't have a USB port.  An AC adapter is  vital.  I notice that the price is dropping almost daily, so the Bang for  the Buck is improving.  Based upon my experience, this camera is a definite  winner.","Price: Getting better - I paid close to $700 Oct `99<br />Quality: Great!  The pictures are unbelievable... and I mean that. If I print a 4\"x6\" on my HP 952C it is hard to tell the difference from a 35mm camera.<br />Function: The  camera could use a better design but it is still much better than some  other ones I have tried. The review screen is perfectly placed where your  nose hits it when you are taking a picture so I am constantly cleaning it  off.<br />In high quality mode mine holds about 30 pictures (20meg card).  This is plenty for most events/photo ops. After I take 3-5 pictures I go  back and review them and delete the ones that I don't like. This way, when  you have 30 pictures in your card they are 30 pictures that you like. Much  better that taking a whole roll of 35mm pictures and only liking 5 of them  once they are developed.<br />Overall I love the camera (and so do all my  friends that try it).","the camera is pretty good. the only thing i didnt like about it is that the real tim viewing on the lcd screen is real slow and kinda pixly. but hey its not suppose to be a movie camera right. the pics i took are very good. i almost wish that they were so crisp. it looks so much like real  life in the pics it doesent even look like a pic. witch i guess i good.  overall i think this camera is pretty desent. for the price on it now you  cant go wrong. oh lordy though do you need memory. ... anyway this camera was great and i really like  that it comes with rechargable batteries and a charger. it is even easier  to get picturs of of it than a...100 doller camera i had before.","I just got mine in the mail on Friday and I must have taken about 300 pictures already (mostly of my cat who now feels like Cindy Crawford).  The pictures (mostly indoors) look spectacular.  I love the fact that I can  preview and chose the pictures I like.  I have been a long time 35 mm user  but I think my Canon EOS will now have to retire for good.<br />The camera is  very easy to figure out. I have never even picked up a digital camera  before this one, but it only took me 20 minutes to figure everything out.  The controls are clear and easy to understand.  I was amazed by the quality  of pictures (both indoors and outdoors).  The camera winds into place ready  to take another picture within seconds (I understand this is a big problem  with some other digital cameras, even the KodaK 290 which is far more  expensive, that take forever to get ready for the next picture).  Focusing  is as easy as with my Canon and I was able to preview the pictures right  away, first on the camera, then on my computer and finally as a slide show  on my TV (great feature for family gatherings). You can also see what a  picture would look like before you even take it. I also managed to use the  framing feature for some cool effects, as well as the B&W feature to  make some of my cat's picture look very \"astistic\".  There are  several other features (like the ability to record date and time on the  Picture)  but it would take too much time and space to mention.<br />Now the  bad things.  Battery life is miserably short, and if you plan to use the  screen in the back of the camera to review your pics, then good luck. You  definetely need to get an AC adapter  so when you are reviewing your  pictures at home, you don't waste batteries.  And when you go out take at  least 2 set of baterries with you.  The software that came with the camera  crashed my computer a few times (and I have a 600Mhz Pentium III).  I  understand there are some downloads that I need to get, so maybe that will  fix the problem.  And my big complaint, I payed so much money for camera,  but all I got with it was a measly 8mb card that holds less than 20  pictures. I had to shell another $140 for a 64 Mb flash card so I can take  as many pictures as I want (well, not really, I think it is about  100)<br />Overall though, this camera is perfect for beginners (who never used  a digital camera before) and experts.  I highly recommend it.","After careful consideration, our family bought a Kodak DC-280.This camera looks great- USB, zoom, LCD panel, many features-- but get to know it.  While USB is nice, not all computers  have it, and Windows 98 is necessary.  Also the 30-60mm zoom is no where  near as good as I would have liked-- DEFINETLY a 3x zoom is required.  While the resolution is nice, remember that that's not all to a digital  camera.","This camera will remove all doubts: the digital age is here!  Sell you film developing stock, because at the rate these cameras are improving, film will shortly go the way of the Victorola and the telegraph. The DC280  is small, fits well in your hand, does EVERYTHING film point-and-shoot  cameras do, including a modest zoom capability (for framing), and much  more.  You can preview your pictures and discard them on the spot, thus  saving room for more pictures.  You can get a 96MB Compact flash memory  card (think of it as the \"film\" of a digital camera) which will  hold hundreds of pictures, (great for vacations when you don't take your  computer).  The flash recharges quickly, the LCD lets you frame the actual  picture, the viewfinder works well when you want to conserve your  batteries, and the auto focus is flawless.  Kodak maintains a web page and  I have already upgraded the \"firmware\" (the cameras operating  system).  The pictures, even at the large 8\" x 10\" are stunning.  If you can't get great pictures with this camera, stick to buying  postcards.<br />It comes with everything you need to get going, including  alkaline batteries to start you snapping, while the included rechargeables  are charging in the included charger.  The only things I have since ordered  are the DC adapter and a nice case to keep my camera safe.  I love it!","I have used three cameras lately: 1) Sony DSC-505  2) Olympus C-2020 3) Kodak DC280 All three have 2.1 Megapixel and good lenses. The Sony is the only one with no Zoom, but has the best picture quality and the best  lowlight exposure. There is also the DSCF505 which has the huge 3xzoom  lens, but it is too big to be nice. The Sony is also the smallest and the  easiest to use. The operating system is similar to the DV camcorders. The  second best is the Olympus C-2020 due to its zoom lens, the viewfinder and  just weaker in low light conditions. The 130 pictures will fit onto a 64MB  Smartmedia in HQ, a little more than with Sony. The Kodak I liked the  least, mostly because of its klunky operating system and the poor colors  (in comparison). I currently use the Olympus for professional work and the  Sony due to its breast pocket size to snap great photos anywhere and  anytime.","PROS:<br /> Easy to use<br /> Controls are well laid out<br /> Turns on very quickly unlike the DC260<br /> Photo quality is excellent<br /><br /> CONS:<br /> LCD location (when you're taking a picture and have the camera close, it can hit your nose causing smudge marks)<br /> Battery drainage (rechargeables recommended)<br /> No remote control<br /><br />For the price, the DC280 beats the rest.","I have used this camera now for about 3 weeks and couldn't be happier. I am using both to post photos to the web and also to print some of my favorites. In both cases, this camera really shines. The colors are better  than any 35MM camera I have ever used, and I have even tested it by taking  the same photos with both cameras.<br />The best feature about it is the built  in USB support. This allows you to upload photos to your computer in just a  few seconds. A friend of mine has a Nikon Coolpix 800, and I have to laugh  as he waits several minutes to upload one photo since it doesn't have the  USB support.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this camera. I have yet to see  one under $1000 that comes any where near close to this one. Excellent.","I have had this camera for about 6 weeks now and all though I am somewhat satisfied, I think that the picture quality could be better for this price and resolution. I also purchased an Olympus D340R for a friend, and  although it is only 1.3 Megapixels, the color is much better, the pictures  blow up almost as well, despite the lower res., and the LCD display is  sharper and easier to view in daylight. Considering the huge difference in  price, the Olympus is a bargain. Of course it does not zoom, but you can  hardly call the 60mm of the Kodak a real zoom. Having used zoom lenses on  35mm SLRs for years I can testify that the 30 to 60 zoom is more like  medium wide angle to normal view, rather than true zoom. You will have to  buy an accessory 2X lens and adapter to get true + zoom. If you want a less  expensive, good performing, zoom camera, check out the Olympus D450 Zoom.","I've had this camera for 2 months now, and have taken 500 pictures with it.  Some of these, I've taken duplicate pictures with 35mm or APS, and the colors on this camera (DC280) comes out way ahead.<br />A case in point, one ocean picture by the DC280 showed detail in the distant fog, along with varying reflections (of the fog) on the water. Dark blue sky filled in behind and above the fog.  The APS picture was all washed out - you could hardly tell the difference between the fog and sky. Both were taken with automatic exposure settings, and taken within 1 minute of each other.<br />Down side to this camera is that 1) It eats through baterries (common problem to these types of cameas - fortunately Koday supplies NiMH rechargable batteries); 2) Limited zoom range; and 3) LCD display gets washed out in the sunlight.<br />Up side to this camera are 1) Excellent sharpness in prints up to 5x7 - okay in 8x10; 2) Colors that will knock your socks off (much better than the Nikon Coolpix 950 that I use at work); 3) It acts and feels like a real camera; 4) Software and Camera operations are very natural and easy to learn (I'm still stuggling with the Nikon, and I'm a computer engineer!)<br />Bottom line: This is an excellent entry into the digital world. It outperforms cameras that cost much more. If you can live with the limited zoom range for now, you won't be disappointed.","Digital cameras are here to stay. As much as I'd like to stay with my old SLR, it's time to move from film to disk. I've had the Kodak 280 for 3 months and I'll say that it was a good buy. The pictures are very good,  it's easy to use - just point and click. As with any automatic camera, you  don't have great control over exposure and lens settings, but for indoor  and typical outdoor shots, its fine. The USB downloads fast compared to  serial. The rechargeable batteries dye after about 30 downloaded pictures  to your PC... get the optional AC cable (I think 39$). Everything digital  is overpriced for what it is. My camera does sometimes act quirky; but I  think it always has to do with low batteries. You'll have to get another  set of the rechargeable nickel metal hybrid batteries if you go on the road  with your camera. And the software is ok. The downloading should be easier  when you don't want to touch up your photos.<br />I'll keep my 35 mm SLR for  those vacation trips where I'll take 10 rolls of film and I want more  camera control, but if you want instant, good quality pictures in an  everyday, take it anywhere camera (as long as you don't need more than 35  pictures before downloading), this is the camera. Or you can take your  laptop with you or buy more overpriced memory cards.","I am a photographic and computer enthusiast and having these two elements come together is a delight for me. So, I have all the very expensive stuff, including KODAK's $20m commercial digital cameras. So, I know what quality  is and how much it costs. Bottom-Line as starters, the DC280 makes great  color shots with very suprising Hi-detail. The Advertisments say  \"good\" for 8x10 photos, however, as a very picky guy, when you  get past 5x7 print sizes, the pictures start to turn fuzzy. But the 5x7  prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors. But, so what, how many  prints does one make larger than 5x7 anyway. This camera is easy to use  & small, and I carry it on vacation locations, when I don't want to  carry my larger and heavier commercial camera. I was truly shocked at the  excellent picture quality of the 280. ALSO, KODAK includes great software,  so after a picture taking day/nite, one can easily connect to the yellow  video plug on your TV (or Hotel TV) for a slide show of the days  activities. I would recommend purchasing a 64MB memory card with the camera  purchase, so you'll get plenty of picture opportunities (75+ shots) without  having to worry about using up memory. In other words, since you can erase  shots you don't like, take MANY, MANY shots and pick the best ones you like  for printing or e-mailing. I bring my laptop with me on trips, so in the  evening, I can copy the photo-files to the hard disk, and erase the camera  memory card, in preparation for the next days photo activities. KODAK  provides serial, USB cables, and software to accomplish this simply.  Definitely do NOT buy a digital camera with less than 2,000,000 pixels.  (The older models, presently having good sale prices, are technology of 2/3  years ago, and you'll wish you spent the extra money for this camera).  Since KODAK has been the color business for 100 years, (well...50+years)  its no surprise that they have created an electronic imager (the CCD Chip)  with the BEST Color quality and detail. This is a must have, you'll not be  dissappointed. If you have another few hundred dollars, check out the SONY  or OLYMPUS dye-sublimation printers, which produce actual photo quality  continuous tone prints up to 4x5 sizes; These printers are not dot-matrix's  with all the little dots. The camera and the printer makes for a great  combo family gift for under $2m, that anyone in the family can use without  having to even turn on a computer, as the printer prints directly off the  camera memory card. SO that you don't make yourself craze, and since its  slightly different than a typical film point and shoot camera, be sure to  read the instruciton booklet, before pushing all the buttons. The  documentation KODAK gives you is very easy to understand, so take it slow  when you open the Box for the first time. It's so intuitive to use, after  the first 2 outings, you NOT need to keep going back to the booklets.  JLW/991203.","I just received it today, setup the date/time, and  was taking pictures in five minutes... Downloaded to the desktop and they looked great... Serial port is very slow though... Use the USB or the PCMCIA adapter (not  included) for MUCH faster downloads.... TRUE its only a 2X zoom, but there  are lens adapters available from Kodak that will double the zoom, so you  will get a 4X zoom... My advise is go for the pixels.... get the dc280","Purchased for spouse.  She was taking excellent pictures within minutes even though she had never used one before.  Uploads to PC  were easy. Supplied cables  worked without any problem the first time.  Included  rechargeable batteries was a good idea by Kodak.  Decided on this one after  many hours of research and the PC Mag selection as the best digital camera.","I just recently bought this digital camera for our real estate business...I was comparing this model with a comperable Sony model....after viewing the specs...NO QUESTION THIS WAS THE ONE ! ...a ton of software, and accessories that were included for this price..you have it all.. The over 2,000,000 pixels it has in High Resolution...one word WOW ! and it is so easy to use with the software and the USB port.. I would HIGHLY reccommend this digital camera to everyone..worth the PRICE--VALUE and everything it has to offer.","Kodak has pulled a quick one by improving the picture quality while reducing the zoom capability that the DC240 has.  The DC240 is rated up to 117mm while the DC280 is only 60mm.  Buy the DC240 and you will love the  results, its a great camera."]},{"name":"Olympus C-2500 L","amazon_reviews":["I just opened the camera package last night, and within acouple of hours I was experimenting with most of the features of thecamera.  When people talk of digital cameras they love to talk numbers, but who cares?  It's what you can do with it that matters.  I took a picture of a dark hallway with the flourecent bathroom lights on, and it looked like something out of The Shining.  It was dark and foggy outside, but with the aperture full open, ISO 400, and the shutter open for 8 seconds I was able to take pictures of the buildings and night lights.  The camera is so light I didn't have to use a stand (at 8 seconds you have to be as steady as a sharpshooter, though... be sure to hold our breath).  Using the flash, with the spot metering and the aperture closed I was able to take a crisp, detailed picture of our dog in the midst of the night, doing dog things.  With the multiple picture thing I took 5 pictures of my friend in a row waving his arms, and the sequence of where his arm is going is clear when viewing the 9 pictures at one time from the LCD.  I'm also going to throw out my slow ... scanner, which I was using for sending faxes. I took a picture of a page from Webster's collegiate dictionary, and it was readable from the LCD!<br />Make no mistake, this is not a replacement for an analog camera.  The casing and the interface feel like a cheap digital camera.  I think, however, that in many ways this is better than an analog camera.  You can do the things that are possible with an analog camera (except maybe for star trails), but with greater simplicity.  And you get instant feedback.<br />If you are a journalist, claims investigator, or web publisher, and you have some basic knowledge of analog photography (...), this is definitely the camera for you.  I recommend you get the ATA adapter so you won't have to mess with stupid cables or limited software.<br />Gotta go take some more pictures....","I love this this camera.  The pictures quality is excellent.  The ease of use is 5 star.  It comes with 32Meg flash, it's good for 50 pictures. Has easy dial for auto, semi-auto and manual modes. I took 50 pictures first day I got it.  All 50 were excellent quality, compare to my \"old\"  sony PC1 digital video recorder. Down load to my portable is easy with  compact flash, if you don't forget to  put 2 batteries included with  compact flash.  Camera also comes with batteries, and recharger.<br />Overall excellent, 5Star I am very happy with it.","If your into computers and you'd like to integrate your photography into your computer world this is definitely the camera for you.  If you already know how to use a 35mm SLR you'll find learning how to use most of this camera fairly easy.  It has an auto mode that makes it possible for anybody  to use and it has some manual modes that I've not yet totally conquered. It  has enough pixels to blow your mind most of the time.  You can't buy a  monitor big enough to view the shots in SHQ mode all at one time with your  browser.<br />You can change pixel density on the fly.  You change the  effective film speed in steps of 100, 200 and 400 ASA.  You can vary your  exposure plus or minus 2 fstops in 1/3 fstop increments.  You can focus  down to 0.8 inches and set it at infinity.  You can get 150 or 200 shots  out of a set of batteries.  You can put on a slide show into a standard TV  set right from your camera.  You can take great remote control shots  without even touching the camera or a cable. You can view your pictures on  sight and zoom in to see quite good detail right on the camera.  The  controls are easy to use and and very ergonomically designed.  You can  delete pictures.  You can transfer pictures from a smart media card to a  compact flash card for extra storage.  You can run off of AC power (I never  do). The built flash works okay but the red eye feature sucks.  You can use  averaging or spot meter mode for exposure calculation.<br />It's really nice  to have a laptop computer with a PCMCIA card in it.  When you fill up a  smart media card you can stick it into the PCMCIA card and the computer  see's it as an extra drive on your machine with all of your JPEG files  readily accessible.  I normally put my laptop on my network and drag and  drop all of the files on to a CD Burner in Adaptec mode.  I've used the  serial port adaptor but it's very slow and anybody who spent this much  money for the camera probably wont tolerate such bad performance for long.<br />Don't spend all of your money buying this camera.  Buy 3 sets of  batteries. (3 hour charge time) and the PCMCIA card adapter (much faster  and hot plugable). Get a CD Burner for your computer.  I have a friend that  has an HP for his laptop...He doesn't like.  I have an HP and a Sony for  two of my desktops and I like them both. I've had the camera for about 3  months now and I've taken about 2000 shots with it. I'm on my second CD.  One day at work I spent the whole day taking pictures of old photographs on  the wall to send to a guy at a trade show.<br />The CAMEDIA software is simple  but very useful.  It's good at renaming your shots in batch mode and it has  a good browser mode for previewing new shots. The Adobe Photo deluxe is  tolerable but slow.  I've purchased Print Shot Pro and I like it a lot  more.  It's also good to have Image Robot and Smart Media Center as well  (all from Jasc software).  Smart Media Center has a feature that creates a  HTML environment that allows you to create photo albums viewable totally by  your browser.  It's great for sending photo CD's to your friends and  family.  If you want to see some photos I've made go to  [...] and search on for the album named \"Singing  Youth of Denver at Dahlia Street\".<br />A lot of people have asked me the  price of the camera and I've told them.  However, the real price involves a  lot more.  You need to have some computer power available to you.  You need  to not be afraid of the technology.  Installing a PCMCIA card is easy for  me but my father would not have done it. This camera will force most people  who purchase it to learn some new things and if they do so willingly then  they will enjoy the experience.  If you must see your pictures on paper (I  don't) then be prepared for some additional cost.  Your average printer  will not do that great of a job.<br />I've been waiting for a digital camera  of this performance for a couple of years and it's been worth the wait.  I  suspect that in five years everyone will have a camera like this.  This is  the perfect camera for a CEO.  You can take useable pictures of anything  and view them anyware with your laptop.","I purchased my C-2500 before Christmas and haven't any regrets . Using it is much more of a breeze then I have read in the reviews. Now I send family or customers photos that are so nicely done that they always think they are  35mm. I print them out on my HP-1100 printer. What a great pair. I  purchased readers, But really never use or hassle with them . I think both  the camera & printer, together are what really increases the enjoyment.  I also have both lenses and the flash attachment. Lenses are worth it, but  haven't mastered the flash settings yet.The investment was hard but has  paid me back already.","If you like using a 35mm SLR, the Olympus C-2500 is so close, it's difficult to tell the difference.

The menu is somewhat cumbersome until you  learn how to use the toggle button and understand all the features but with  all this camera can do, it is worth learning.  The camera comes complete  with rechargeable battiers and a charger.  The resolution is fantastic and  the software included not only allows you to clean up your photos, but seam  them together to get a full 360 panorama effect.  I am very pleased with  this product.","If you are an advanced amateur photographer who wants a digital camera, you should take a serious look at the Olympus C-2500L.

I own a Nikon CoolPix 950 also, and this is ALMOST as good (although about 1.5 times as expensive).

Perfect for quick shots and fast to download. I can take this camera to my work to take photos of electronic equipment and all I need is a couple of floppy disks and any primitive PC will have a slot for floppy disk (as far as I have seen). Compared to other digital cameras that need USB, memory cards and other stuff, this one is handy. Floppy disks are not that expensive when compared to memory cards.<br />Also great to use it for taking picture of items to be sold on eBay. I will not recommend to take this camera in your next vacation trip to Europe or to the Caribbean, the bulky size makes it awkward to carry around but, if you do, bring a \"fanny pack\" full of floppy disks..LOL","Would you like a camera you can easily learn to use. Would you like to be able to produce professional quality photos?<br />I own an fd73 and I treasure it deeply. I can take pictures in just about every setting and come out with superb photos. The camera has more than paid for itself. I know that most people who do auctions online, use the Mavica fd73. It comes with an instruction manual which easily ezplains how to use the camera, and explains in detail about the various programs and effects of the camera and how to best use them. It features the special effects of Black and White, Sepia, Solarized, and Negative Art, and also has settings for various situations such as night photography, outdoor daylight photography, etc.<br />My family and friends all love the photos I take. Some have contracted me to do various projects for them and I had great success. It is a camera which is great for special occasions such as weddings, graduations, birthdays,. Plus it also does great at sporting events, parties etc.<br />I'm into nature photography, and have shot some outstanding photos with the fd73.<br />If you want a camera that fits into just about every situation, if you want a camera that, for the most part, all you have to do is point and click, and if you want a camera that can give you some of the most beautiful memories in pictures, you'll want to own a Mavica fd73.","I have used this camera since the late 1990s for mostly professional purposes. I write and edit a newsletter for a state agency and am often asked to take photos at award programs and/or to accompany job announcements, often with almost no prior notice.<br /><br />Of all the cameras I looked at in the 1990s, this was the one that best suited my needs. The reasons for that follow:<br /><br />1. Shooting photos on a diskette was easier than engaging software and changing documentation from the camera to a file on my PC.<br /><br />2. The 10X zoom is very accurate and allowed me to do adequate work even when I could not get close to my subject.<br /><br />3. The camera is flat out easy to use and has a large viewfinder, a large left hand grip, and big button to press when shooting pictures.<br /><br />Before I bought this camera, I worked for three decades for newspapers and in communications offices of governmental and nonprofit agencies doing the same kind of work I do now. In all those years I never used a camera that was as easy to use as this one, nor did I use one where transmitting the product from the equipment to e-file was easier.<br /><br />Having said that, this is a low resolution camera that will not always give good results. It is adequate for head shots and has always come through for me in events.<br /><br />But I've taken photos of my cats at home where their eyes look more like diamonds than eyes, and I took some pictures of the Christmas tree where the lights looked more like the stars or snowflakes than lights on a tree.<br /><br />So don't buy this to create award-winning photography. For all the same reasons, it doesn't produce very good hardcopy photos.<br /><br />But this is a great camera for someone that needs to take pictures right now and get an adequate product online fast. That's my mission at work and this camera has always helped me achieve it.<br /><br />In addition, the battery charger works fast and I've never had to pay a dime to get anything fixed in more than a half-decade of use. I don't know how this stacks up in the camera industry but it's a lot better than most of the electronic equipment I use in the office or at home.","Given camera as a gift, and as a novice is incredibly easy to use.  However...I quickly discovered (after spending nearly $100 on prints) that obtaining quality 4x6 prints is not an option. In order to get decent resolution I am limited to wallet sized pictures.  Bottom line??? If you prefer to thumb through a photo album years later, strongly consider a different camera with higher mega pixels.","If you are looking for easy storage of pictures without the hassle of uploading them to your PC, this is the camera for you.  It is big and bulky.  Pictures are terrific, cam is easy to use.<br />Best:  Easy to use.<br />Worst: Big & Bulky.","I have had the FD 73 for three years now.  When it was brand new, my wife got hit by a wave at the tip of Cabo San Lucas with the camera around her neck.  The camera was in a case but the wave was so strong, water and sand actually got in the camera.  We dried it out and it didn't affect camera function at all.  That was a huge relief because three years ago this camera sold for $500.  I use it at work a lot to take pictures at office functions.  Everyone is amazed I can pop the disc in any computer and email or print the pictures instantly.  I have used it on vacations outside the US in Internet Cafe's to email pictures home.  It's best features are it's so easy to use and you can view the pictures on any computer anywhere in the world simply by inserting the floppy disc.  The only problem I have had with the camera is getting consistent picture quality in very light or very dark settings.  That may be operator error but after three years it still happens.  I have looked at upgrading to a MVC with more megapixels but I have learned for each feature you add you lose some of the simplicity of the FD73.","This camera was a gift to me by my parents before I set off to study abroad in Japan three years ago.  It was given to me with the promise that I would email photos back home on a frequent basis.  Since then I have spent two years in Japan and have taken over 12,000 photos with the Mavica.  It is extremely durable -- I have dropped it at least a half-dozen times from a standing height, and has been exposed to mist and humidity countless times -- and it still functions perfectly to this day.  The function of the floppy disk easily makes it the most convenient camera for email and quick uploading.  Though because of the size it is to accommodate the floppy disk, the camera is a little on the bulky size.  And the zoom is incredible!  The 10x optical zoom is still the function that has most impressed people who have seen the photos I have taken.  Yes, the camera has poor picture resolution compared to most cameras on the market, and it has been the one function that has frustrated me when I wish to take detailed photos, but the camera has served me well; a great rough and tumble digital camera.  Ultra convenient and superb in LCD viewing with quality and speed (most cameras have a jerky reaction to movement when viewing, not this camera), this is a perfect camera for a person new to digital cameras or needs one for quick and snappy photography.  I would have rated it 5 stars, but with the plethora of cameras out there today, this camera's glory days are over.","I originally brought this camera to take pictures of my artist teddy bears so I could put photos of them online for customers. For this purpose, the Sony MVC-FD73 is perfect -- handy zoom, great battery life, easy to hold, lots of neat little picture adjustment features. However ... as soon as I started having photos printed from this camera, I was hugely disappointed. The resolution simply is not good enough. The pictures are grainy and pixelized. If you want a digital camera for online work only, this baby will do great. But for your photo album, you'd be adviced to look elsewhere.","The Mavica FD73 is a good camera if you're just getting started out.  But the low 0.3 megapixel resolution is a problem.  Even on the \"fine\" setting, it's still not enough detail to really satisfy.  Love the removable-media method of storing pictures - allows extended sessions by giving you an unlimited and easily-replenishable supply of media (you can make a quick dash to a local Wal-Mart in a pinch).<br />All in all, great camera for casual photo-shooting, or if you're shooting photos for a personal Web site or small-business Web site.  But if you're really into photography, and need the resolution, get one of the CD Mavicas.","This camera is perfect for what it is meant to do....provide a user-friendly, quality introduction to digital photography for the beginner.  I had never used a digital camera before, and the very first day that I had the camera, I was snapping away like a pro.  (And I bought the camera at an on-line auction site for an excellent price, so it's an even better bargain!)  I am even pleased with the quality of the printed-out pictures; I've noticed that the quality of the photos improve if I edit the pictures down to a smaller size (my computer's pre-loaded photo software program will do this.)  It's important to remember that, if a shot doesn't come out perfectly, you can always view it through the LCD display, delete it, and re-take the shot.  If I ever get more seriously into digital photography, I will consider an upgrade to a higher-resolution Mavica, but for now I am having a ball with this camera!","I finally broke away from my 35mm Nikkon and decided to try a digital one...one draw back, the LCD screen is impossible to view in bright light. I had to move to shade or snap and hope they came out. I was able to view in the index at the pics to see if they turned out before I moved on which helped. There is a ev+1.5 to ev-1.5 and a brightness control along with choice of event setting. I carry a few floppies disks with me and edit them at home...Overall, the cam is a great buy, even more so at the price I got it....Safe enough for the kids to use too!","A great basic digital camera. The floppy is terrific because it is easy to use even for the 'analog' generation. You can always take the floppies to a pal's house or to Kinkos to print out photos if you don't have a computer or printer. PLUS you don't need to know anything about computers to use this camera. I took this camera on a trip around the world for the millennium, it went to the Democratic National Convention and has been at my side for scores of conferences. I've probably taken more than 3000 photos with it. Most I would rate at about 80-85 on the l00 percent scale. Not perfect BUT very acceptable.<br />Enjoy your camera, you can get it at a great price now. Plus you can then download easily and store your photos in JPEG format.<br />My only challenge has been that the flash seems to not work perfectly in really dark rooms. But maybe that's just me?? Anyone with suggestions I'd appreciate them. Thanks<br />FD73 owner.","I've been using this particular model for three years. I use it mainly to take pics of the various items I sell on eBay, and I've found it to be fairly reliable, although the picture quality & resolution isn't always consistent. Some of my photos will be reasonably crisp & clear; others will be a bit muddy. Of course, this could just be due to a lack of photography skills on my part, since my parents also own one of these, and their photos consistently come out nice and clear. They use theirs to take reference pics and event photos for the various organizations they're involved in.<br />The Mavica MVC-73 is okay for taking outdoor & social function pics so long as the place being photographed is reasonably well-lit, and the proper picture-type settings are being used. Unfortunately, the flash function for darker occasions isn't all that hot. It throws a bit too much light on the subject(s), and has a limited range of about eight feet (approx. 2.5 meters). Beyond that, you might as well have taken the pic without the flash at all.<br />The camera also features a playback mode, where you can review the previous pics in the disc. It's a good thing to have in case you're not sure if the last snap you took came out well or not. In my case, usually not! Another nice feature is the auto shut-off, which kicks in after about two minutes of disuse.<br />Although the battery is stated to last for up to 2.5 hours, I've never gotten more than an hour and 50 minutes from a ful charge. Never the less, a `full' cell will usually last me a week or so, since I don't use it too much. One somewhat inconvenient thing about the battery, though: you have to remove it to recharge it, instead of just plugging it directly into an AC adapter/charger. And even though the storage on 3.5 inch disks is convenient in one sense (I can download the pics from the disk into the hard drive faster), the limited capacity of the disk can be a problem. At most, I can get 18 images onto one floppy.<br />Oh, and one last thing. I know this sounds a bit cliché, but do remember to remove the lens cap before trying to photograph something! I've had times when I'd turn my camera on, and the view screen would be completely dark, when it should've been showing whatever the lens was aimed at! Speaking of the lens cap, it's attached to the neckstrap by a small cord. Although it has a small clip on it to hook onto the neckstrap, it never stays on! This isn't so bad if you're clickin' pics at the normal angle & elevation, but when you're shooting snaps of things on the ground below you like I do, that dangling cover in the frame can be a real pain!<br />`Late","My whole family loves our digital camera!  We're getting about 20 \"fine\" photos to a disk, or about 40 on \"standard\".  We've had it for about a year & a half.  It's even been dropped in a parking lot & is as good as new.  Great for e-mailing photos, or printing out for snail-mails!  :-)","I ordered this camera for my Dad.  He needed an easy-to-use camera for his real estate business.  The easiest I could imagine was pictures on floppy disks to e.mail to clients, no USB transfer.<br />I worked with the camera for a week and it was great.  I had to give it up to him reluctantly, so I'm ordering another to use in my web site business.","This is the most exciting camera in it's price range that I have ever owned!  The LCD is large enough to easily view the pictures that are taken.  And the convenience of the floppy disk storage is worth noting.  An average of 23 pictures taken in the \"fine\" mode can be stored on each disk.  One can easily access the photos taken, by simply inserting the disk into the PC's disk drive for viewing and editing with the software included.  It is not necessary to take up space on the hard drive for storage, as each disk can be labeled and retained for future viewing and use. The picture quality is magnificient both indoor and outdoor... The subject as viewed is the resulting photo. Each photo is easily attached to e-mail for shared viewing.  Superior product - easy to use!","As this is my first digicam, I bought the FD73 for its price, simplicity, ease of use, unique diskette storage and large 2.5\" LCD screen. I'm not disappointed, to say the least! On my large 20\" computer screen the \"Normal\" mode\" images look just \"Fine\"! Even after severely cropping images, they remain remarkably sharp. Love the 10x zoom. Indoors and outdoors out of the sun the LCD screen is great. In \"Normal\" mode I make an average of 25 pictures per diskette.<br />On the down side, I miss the time exposure option. The LCD screen is weak under sunlight. Suggestion: Try positioning yourself in a shaded area. The 120 min. battery empties much faster than that! Avoid battery drainage by turning off the beep and not using the image management menu (deletion, copying, formatting, etc.). The user manual doesn't provide much details about camera specifications.","My first digital, after my old Canon AE1 gave up the ghost.  I needed heavy macro capability for shooting small objects, mostly for recording my student's art projects.  Delighted with the ease of operation and macro really IS great, but color balance can be off sometimes (vivid - but off.)  Blow ups are grainy, repetitive detail (such as background vegetation) looks like a bad computer-generated drop-in effect.  I bought it on sale well below list, so overall it's been a good value for me.<br />Suggested uses: Compiling a virtual student portfolio, close-up photos, teaching beginning photography or visual composition to younger students, documentation for inventory or insurance purposes, pet photos, etc.<br />Suggested tip:  If formatting disks in the camera eats up battery time, format a bunch ahead of time and then charge the battery so it's set to go again.","Both my mother and myself bought one of these for use at auctions, and don't know what we would do without them!  Sure, the resolution is not as high as others, but for what it meant to do the Mavica is untouchable.  Wonderful to use at school with my students, as well!","The Mavica MVC-73 is a good low end camera.  If I want to blow up my pictures to 16X20, I use my 35mm SLR.  Megapixel cameras do take better pictures but they require EXPENSIVE memory cards.  The camera takes great shots for web sites and email.  If you shop around, floppies cost almost nothing.  With a rebate, I bought 100 floppies.  I put 10 of them in a bag and I took over 200 photos. (It would have cost me hundreds of dollars to save that many pictures on memory cards.) They used up less room than two rolls of film.  The recharable battery lasts forever and I can go out and take hundreds of photos without having to dump the memory card.  Achiving the photos uses little disk space on my hard drive.  The camera is very easy to use and in the long run pays for itself on the savings on film development, batteries or extra memory.  I give copies of disks right on the spot and the camera is very reliable. If you are looking for a good \"snapshot\" camera, this is a good one.  The other reviews mention the good and bad points of the camera so there is no need to mention them again.  This is a great camera for real estate or onsite documentation and great for the 100000000 pictures of the baby or the family picnic.  It's a fun, simple and easy to use camera. How many pictures do you wind up enlarging?  I run my favorites on my screensaver and they look great.","I purchased the Sony MVC-FD73 yesterday on behalf of my husband for use at his school with children aged 5-11 years old.He charged the battey up and then handed it to me As I already own a digital camera and have photo editing software on my computer he thinks I must be an expert! I took 14 photographs, they had to be indoors as it was dark outside. Cats and dogs were  most unco-operative, but eventually I had enough pix to work on and transfered them into the computer, re-sized added captions and printed them out. I found the camera very easy to use. It was very quick and easy to transfer the photos from the floppy to my hard drive, and the results were pretty good, seeing as I had not even bothered to read the instruction manual. I did have problems with red-eye, which I could have corrected if I had not been in such a hurry. The photo resolution is not as good as on my Kodak camera, but for beginners and certainly for children, it was good enough. I liked the fact it was easy to use and had various diferent modes, the Fine Art one was good, I have a lovely \"Impressionist\" type photograph of my blue Burmese cat. If you want a camera that is fast and easy, as a starter kit, this seems to be a good buy. ... , but we always seem to have to pay more on this side of the pond than you lucky folks in USA ! My husband was very please with the printed out results, and he has taken them to school today together with the camera, for the children and the rest of the staff to see. I expect they will have lots of fun using it .","This camera was a great asset to our engineering department. We used it extensively outdoors and at nite in northern Illinois. It gave us the capability to communicate via company intranet in a very fast and accurate manner technical data when we used a reference template in photos..Many cudos to this photo machine.","This is my introduction to the digital camera.  So far, I'm very pleased with the results.  The Mavica is programmed with five picture formats: Fine, Sepia, B&W, Negative Art, and Solarize.  It is easy to use, even for the beginner.  I disagree with some of the reviewers regarding its size.  I was able to shove it in my purse when I wasn't using it; however, for the price, I would've liked to see it come with an extra battery and a carrying case.  It does come with a shoulder strap, which isn't uncomfortable. The camera has zoom capability, but I found that you have to be careful with blurring.  I don't fault the camera, but the photographer.  I have had some experience with blurred pictures and red-eyes.  Photo-enhancing software such as PhotoShop will take care of that.  I know because I've tried. The Mavica works well with Macs and PCs.  The only problem I came across was sending the pictures after editing them with PhotoShop.  If your mother doesn't have the same software that you do, then you will have to send that blurry or red-eyed picture of Junior.  Oh, well. I like this camera, but if I win the lottery someday, I will go out and buy a CD camera because of the memory constraints that these floppy-based cameras have.","For entry level digital photography, you could do far worse than the Mavica.  What sold me initially, aside from the very reasonable price, was that it used floppy discs instead of internal storage.  What this means is that if you have a pocket full of discs you can take pictures all day without ever having to download to your PC.  It also means you don't have to worry about a free parallel, serial or USB port, which, if you're a peripheral junkie like me, is reason enough to give serious consideration to this camera.<br />On the downside - yes, there is one - the resolution is not what you might hope for.  When used at normal size, the pics are fine, not great.  They're useable.  When you try to increase the size to 5x7 or 8x10, the results are disastrous.  The other downside is that the flash will frequently wash out the entire picture, but the camera does not function well indoors with available light.  You really have to fiddle with your settings to get this right.  Sometimes it's just not possible.<br />So, do I recommend this camera?  Yes, with reservations.  If you're looking for high quality output and you have the bucks to spare, then look elsewhere.  But if you want a decent camera for a reasonable price, particularly for outdoor use, check out the Mavica.","started using  a 35 mm  and large format camera , now into  the digital age and  grand children are an endless supply of  fun with this unit and  am taking all  the photos and coping them to cd. and for storage i use my laptop  and then email files home to be edited .you can use bitmap  and  fifty floppys  are only a few  bucks  so you can use hundreds  at a wedding  and load them to the  view at the wedding  the christmas photos  were fantastic  i emailed  hundreds out to friends and relatives .  \"now if sony can only come up with something to copy all the old 35mm  negatives i have\"  a negative copyier  to colour","We bought our camera this past spring to use at a wedding.  It was awesome.  I love the fact that it is very easy to use and you can view them on any computer.  It holds up to 23 pics on one floppy and we like the way you can copy right over the picture you take as many times as you want to.  We made a copy of the pictures we took for family members instantly.  The zoom is wonderful and we find that Sony makes the best.","The Sony Mavica FD73 is lots of fun and easy to use.  The convenience of being able to use 3 1/2\" discs as your storage media is worth a lot.  The zoom and macro capability is excellent.  Having said that, the picture quality is acceptable for snapshots, email, and auction sites, but is a far cry from photo quality.  The images get very grainy in low light, and are quite pixelated if enlarged at all.  Reflections and very bright spots are not handled well...light to dark transitions are coarse.  You'll be able to get decent prints up to about 5X7, but beyond that things start to get a bit fuzzy.  I've had great fun with this camera and enjoy using it, but I'm currently shopping for an FD88 to improve the image quality.","I have had this camera for only a few months, and I LOVE the pictures I've taken!  The prints from them look great!  The color and lighting is always just right, as long as you don't get too close with the flash.  I have enlarged one of them to about a 6x9\" and it looks good, only just a little grainy if you look close.  I never use my regular camera any more.  My only problem is that I need a good printer to print the photos on!","I just got this camera, today, from Amazon and I am more than pleased!  I'm thrilled!  I also have an Olympus digital camera and a Mavica 35mm but this is now my favorite!  No transferring your images with other software and the pictures are remarkablly clear!  Easy to operate and the features are wonderful!  The telephoto capability is amazing!  Even in low light the images came out clear.  I've already emailed images of my kids (5 furry ones with long tales!) to my friends and family and the responses were great!  Even the printed photos came out really well!  I also ordered the Case Logic DC70 Digital Camera and Accessory Bag and the Mavica and it's accessories fit inside beautifully!  I have nothing but praise for this digital camera & Case Logic Bag and also for Amazon!!  The best buy on net!","This camera definitely works for what I need it for - taking pictures to use on my Web site, The Schumin Web, and saving the remainder as stock photos.  The floppy disk storage allows for you to take literally thousands of pictures without going back to your computer, and thus gets high marks for portability.  All in all, a great camera, and if you're like me, whenever you take it with you, carry some floppies in your pocket, because you will be taking a lot of pictures.","If you take only 1 thing from this review, let it be this: THIS CAMERA IS NOT FOR YOU IF YOU PLAN TO DO PHOTO-EDITING (MANIPULATION)<br /> Most of the photos you take with this camera will look a little blurry on your computer screen, and God forbid you ZOOM-IN on the photo using your photo-viewing program.  The quality of the photos is horrible (mostly due to the .jpg compression) and gives the photo a 'pastel-color' look to it.  The camera does have a setting to take better quality pictures using .BMP capability but when you use this setting you will be able to fit ONLY 1 PHOTO PER FLOPPY DISK.  Although the quality is better when using .BMP it is still not good enough for a serious photographer.<br /> The LCD screen will get fingerprints on it if you even THINK about putting your finger anywhere near it and if you're under strong sunlight it is hard to see the image.  A viewfinder would've come in handy, however.. I like the idea of not having to put the camera up to my face to take a pic.  A necessary evil you might say.<br /> If you DON'T have money to burn, do yourself a favor and either wait until digital cameras are a dime-per-dozen or take out a mortgage loan to save up for the FD-90 Sony model.  I don't know about you, but ...+ is not something I part with easily least of all for a camera.<br /> WHAT IT IS GOOD FOR: Online Auctions (Ebay), Unimportant pics.  Also, credit must be given where credit is due: For me, the main selling point of the Sony FD series is disk storage capacity.  This is a definite plus that enables you to share photographs with other people when they dont have a photo-downloading facility in their PC (in my experience this includes one hell of alot of people).<br /> The 10x zoom is also a God-send. You can almost use the camera as binoculars if you want to.  The camera also enables you to format a floppy disk (at the expense of alot of battery life).  A fully charged battery will give u approximately 2.5 hrs of camera use.<br /> In closing;  Get this camera if you truly have your heart set on it, but be forewarned about the day that you are going to want to take the PERFECT PHOTO.  It's not going to happen with the FD73.  Not in the standard .jpg compression it delivers, and not at the 640x480 maximum capacity size.","A wonderful camera for Intrnet use. For auctions, emails, web sites, Etc. this is a fine camera. The advantages are great macros (down to 1\"),10X zoom lens, comes with rechagable battery and charger, simple downloading of floppies to your PC and the economy of using floppies as the storage medium.  However this is NOT a camera suitable for Photos (Because of the 640X480 resolution) Do not make the mistake of taking important shots and assume you can get decent photos. For fine photos go to a 1 or 2 megapixel cameras. I also own the Nikon Coolpix 950 camera and recommend any Nikon or Olympus camera. Only the Nikons have great Macro capability (If this is important) A great buy for the money is the Olympus 460/490.","I have been using this camera about 3 months and I love it. It is easy to use and easy to upload pictures! I bought it mostly to take photos of items that I am auctioning online and it serves the purpose well. I bought it because I can put pictures right on floppy disks. I always use the \"fine\" mode when taking pictures and am quite happy. I also use it to take pictures of my neices as well as other general pictures. The pictures come out very clear when you are trying to photograph a small item from a close range and do not zoom in. The playback feature is very useful too and let's you know if you need to do a \"retake\". The only drawback is that photos that come out dark or on the light side tend to be grainy. If you zoom in as much as you can, the photos tend to be grainy as well. Great camera for the online auctioner! Great camera in general!","This camera is quite user friendly, even for complete klutzes, such as I. Easy access to the telephoto and wide angle feature, as well as photo effects. I found it excellent for photographing nature, especially birds and florals. It is quite simple to create nice portrait effects too! Popping in the floppy is very convenient. The flash is not quite bright enough in very dark settings. Too bad there is no way to create a time exposure... this is the only drawback I have found. :-(","I've owned this camera for some time, and I couldn't put it down when I first got my battery charged!<br />The Mavica series is a blessing.  The FD-73 is, I recommend, to be used for general purpose shooting.  The absence of a manual focus and poor quality photographs under low-lighting conditions forces me to rate this with only 4 stars instead of 5.  Photos appear too grainy under low-light.<br />The 10x zoom is great.  The included NPF-330 rechargable Lithium battery is a godsend, giving you up to 3 hours of continual use.  Good idea would be to purchase an additional NPF-550 which lasts much longer.  I always keep one in use, and the other on charge.  The batteries will last around two years before they need to be replaced.  These batteries can be used with many other Sony digital cameras and camcorders.<br />My biggest gripe with the FD-73 is it's resolution: JPEG's are only 640x480 in size.  The compression is so-so.  However, the picture effects (sepia, B&W, solarize, negative) are pretty nifty, although I only used the B&W myself.  Similar effects can be achieved using any good graphics program.  The LCD can be very difficult to view while outside under sunny conditions.  Another gripe is the white-balance: you can't control it.  Taking pictures of family against open scenery is difficult, making photographs appear to be back-lit.<br />The controls were easy to manipulate, and the floppy disc can hold anywhere from 1 (if using Bitmap mode) to 20 pictures (depending on image).  Of course, you can fit more images on a disc using B&W mode if you prefer to take black and white photographs.<br />I eventually upgraded to the FD-91, which isn't available on Amazon.com anymore.  As for the FD-73, if you're into quality, go for a better model.","Maybe I jumped the gun, but I wanted a digital camera for Christmas and I got it!  (It was a gift, but it was the only thing I really wanted!)  I chose the MVC-FD73 'cause it used disketts, seemed easy enough, and has good instructions.  The zoom is great!  I took literally hundreds of pics on our vacation.  I may not ever use them all, but I sure didn't waste any film getting shots of scenes, people, etc.  As far as flash pics go, the flash can be modified, hi, med, low, or off.  Some indoor shots don't come out very well, but that's due to the overall lighting.  I am extremly happy I have this camera!:o)!","I needed a digital camera for listing auctions on eBay. Being that I'm a computer dolt, I sought out the easiest camera to use. The disc feature seemed easiest thus best suited and Consumers' report spoke highly of the camera. My photos are some of the best I've ever seen on eBay and it was a cinch to figure out and use. I have not used many of the bells and whistles, but habitually use the \"bright +/-\" feature: you click that feature a couple of times to compensate for the excesses of natural or man-made light or to get a photo that closer approximates the color of the item photographed. It works miracles and if, in order to closer approximate the color of the object, I end up with a dark photo, my computer software allows me to brighten the image again without distorting the color. Another beneficial characteristic is the clarity of the photos taken from close up. Holding the camera steady is essential. I often need extreme close ups if the object is a war medal or coin or token and get amazing photos by holding the object close to a light in the basement and photographing close up, such that I've got the coin in one hand held toward the basement ceiling and the camera in the other, with the camera between the light and the object so that light hits the object with no shadow. I'm beginning to use this technique for all my close ups of any object. Also, I'm using one of those spiral shaped long-lasting bulbs in the basement, but don't know whether that plays a role in my success with this technique or not. Another great thing about this \"close up\" technique is that I have total control over the light, and can see what image I'm going to get, unlike flash. It is obvious from surfing eBay that most sellers are not savvy to this technique. I sorely wish the camera had a hair trigger though. Especially when I'm doing the basement close up technique, where both hands are over my head and a steady hand is at a premium, yet physically taxing at my age (47), the click button is cumbersome, refusing to respond to gentle suggestion. This problem is distracting, but a small price to pay for the amazing photos that help maximize my sales. This is one great camera.","I like the Mavica because it's fast and it makes a pretty good pictures. Great interface. Easy to use. I recommend this for everyone who wants to make good pictures but not a professional. Andrew Sali","I purchased this camera about a month ago and still am taking pictures galore.  I have read the reviews given here and I must say, I agree and disagree with some.  Personally, I love the floppy disk storage.  It's not  hard at all to throw a few extras in just in case you need them.  I love  the idea of not having to use any cables or \"special\" programs to  download my pics.  I will say though, I have gotten quite a few pics. that  were of poor quality (fuzzy) and then out of the blue...picture perfect.  I  use a photo program I bought from Walmart for $10, EZPhoto (I used it when  I scanned my \"old\" paper photos) and I normally reduce the size  of my picture A LOT to send quicker through emails.  This camera does have  an email feature though. Quite a few people said that you don't get a very  good quality pic. for printing, but I have to say I disagree.  Maybe the  printer they are using is of poor quality.  I have printed hundreds of  pics. and everyone has enjoyed them and are so surprised they came from a  print off from the digital camera.  One thing that disappointed me about  this camera is...for the $ you spend, you don't get a carrying case.  I  bought a cheap \"purse\" that looks like a camera case and has many  compartments to carry all the extras (battery charger etc.). I spent $6 on  it and it was well worth more than that.  You can't tell it's even a purse.  Another thing, I checked all over..stores and internet and the price of  this camera does not really vary...and if  there's a substantial difference in pricing somewhere..CHECK TO BE SURE  YOU'RE GETTING THE BATTERY CHARGER WITH IT!  I found a few places  that advertised at a cheaper price and also found that the charger did not  come with it...","We have three of these cameras here at work and they are great for the field but most of the users say that they are too limiting.  I found this  not entirely true.  After reading the manual that came with the camera, I  found that you can use one of five special effect settings.  While this is  nice, the main point is that you can also chose exposure settings.  I set  it for action photo and took pictures of my nephews playing basketball.  Not a blurry picture among them.  What was really great was that I gave  each one a copy of the pictures right on the spot by bringing some old  floppies with me.  The nephews made wallpaper out of them for their PC's  and they and their friends think it's great.  While my other friends may  have more expensive cameras, they can't share the pictures right on the  spot.  Great for reunions when you only see friends and families once in a  while.  Instead of promising to e-mail or snail mail pictures, just hand  them a copied disk. Oh, yeah, you can also take a picture of yourself with  the timer feature.  Special Note: As soon as I got the camera out of the  box, I taped a clear piece of plastic over the LCD view screen to protect  it.  I read a previous review which said how easily scratched it can get  and seeing our other cameras here at work, I was not taking any chances.  Guess what? Looks ugly but protects well.  Thanks for the info from the  previous review.","I use this camera at work and post the pictures on the company's intranet site. The floppy disks are very convienent for inter-office exchanges, and  it is not difficult to carry around a few extra floppies when you're on the  move and want to take a lot of pictures. I had no trouble at all learning  how to use the camera and had taken a picture, imported it onto my  computer, and posted it on the internet in about 5 - 10 minutes. It is  pretty durable too - I dropped it off the back of a speeding golf cart and  it was fine afterwards (phew).  However, as time went on, I found the  picture quality average at best. The camera does not take reliable shots,  and the quality can vary from excellent to extremely poor. I know how to  use a camera and how to take what should be a good shot, but too often the  pictures end up fuzzy or over/under exposed. I can get better quality  taking non-digital pictures and scanning them in (although this takes  considerably longer). Also - the zoom feature is useful, but like many  zooms, does not quite provide a focused shot.<br /> My advice: if you're  just starting out and looking for a quick and very easy way to take digital  pictures, this camera is a good choice. If you have any experience with  digital cameras or even a regular 35mm, look to spend a little bit more,  and get a lot more quality for your money. You may lose that 10x zoom and  some of the easy-to-use features, but I think it is worth the sacrifice.","Having first used this camera, when a friend bought one, We fell in love with it. We now have one, and have recommended it numerous times as the  best digital out there!<br />We use our primarily for Ebay photos and for  selling. I don't know how or why anyone would not like the floppy disk  storage characteristic. It makes using the digital about as cheap and easy  as taking pictures has ever been!<br />For better clarity and resolution, we  resize almost all of our photos down by 50 %. (then use the sharpen tool)  Adjusting the brightness and contrast also helps immensely!","This camera takes okay pictures and it's very easy to use. Don't be repulsed by other reviewers who doesn't know how to use the camera, just go to your nearby retailer store and look at it yourself. It is in some ways  over-priced due to the zoom and floppy drive; a 10x zoom (optical) with a  640x480 is better than a 6x zoom(2x optical and 3x digital) with 1280x960.  I don't like it when people compare these kind of cameras to other kinds at  the same or lower price using flash cards or smart media, because there are  different essentiel accessories that aren't included in those prices(the  compact flash cards could make you say \"Aaaarrrrrggghhhh! I don't have  enough because I spent every penny on the camera!\").<br />At the end,  this camera still has problems with the quality of the pictures, but it  comes cheaper than other cameras. If you have a lot of money to invest,  don't buy this one, just buy the best camera with the best lens and don't  look at lower priced items, because quality is what you want.<br />Last thing  to say to whom never touched a digital camera, you must know how the camera  works and how and when it take good or even excellent  pictures.<br />Congratulations to those who bought mavicas(me!)!","EXCELLENT FOR E-MAILS AND 5X7 PRINTS. EASY TO USE- EASY TO TRANSFER FLOPPY DISK IMAGES TO CD-RW FOR STORAGE.  THE FLOPPY PLUGS INTO JUST ABOUT ANY PC- AND MOST BROWSERS OPEN THESE JPEG IMAGES.  BUT IF YOU ARE INTO 'IMAGING AND  EDITING' THE MORE X-PENSIVE DIGITALS ARE REQUIRED.  ENJOY THE 'MAVICA'  LINE.  THE FD-73 IS MY CHOICE.","For those who have had problems with screen, scratching, a solution we have found is using PDA screen protectors cut down to fit.  It worked so well on my dad's that he borrowed more of my screen protectors to put them  on all the cameras at his work.  Some brands will also reduce reflections  off the screen.  The scratches that were there are not visible once the  protector is put on.  As far as the Sony Mavica cameras go, the convenience  of the floppy disks makes it very usable technology that is easily  incorporated into life.","To the reviewer looking for parts I lost the battery charger and power cord.  I went to SONY.com and ordered it but needed my serial number and model to make the order. The power cord is on back order but I got the  charger within a week.  Picture quality is average but the convenience of  the disk makes this camera worth it.","dont get me wrong I love my sony camera but when it comes time to find parts for it it is impossible!  my power cord to my battery charger got chewed up by my dog and when I went to find another one I couldnt!  I still  cant to this day so if you find one give me a call!  please!","As a senior citizen I find this camera to be an excellent investment--very easy to use-great pictures and from 35 to 40 pictures per disk--take it everywhere with me--have lots of pictures of all my grandkids and  greatgrandkids","I did not have a need for the audio or video features...did want the ease of the floppy disks and ease of bringing up on pc...I read a lot of the other reviews and decided to buy the Sony 73..have only had it a week , am  so pleased with the quality of pictures so sharp and clear...the 10x zoom  is great...for flowers and close ups .","My first digital camera looks like something out of a Cracker Jack box compared to this one!  The lower of the Mavica line, it does not do video and may have a lower number of pixels, but I feel it is a really great  camera for the price!<br />Being able to store photos directly on disk is the  greatest invention, and the menu/indexing screens allow you to view photos  right away to decide if you want to continue or delete an image without  having to wiat until they're on the computer screen.<br />The battery has a  long life, and recharging is quick and easy.  Bought the package with the  carrying case, which has room for camera, charger, and plenty of  disks.<br />Very happy with this camera overall!","Simple, and easy to use for what it does, this is starting to look a bit overpriced nowadays. On the good side, you can use common floppy discs to save your pictures, the batteries last for ages and it's extremely easy to  use, but on the other hand the resolution (640x480 in hi-res) isn't good  enough for anything more than simple holiday snaps. If you're prepared to  do lots of re-touching you can use it as a useful image aquisition tool,  and the lack of resolution can be a creative spur intself, but for anything  more than simple web-site images and casual snaps you'd be better off with  a proper megapixel camera with some kind of smart-card memory storage.","I just recently purchased this camera, and I have to say that it has made taking pictures fun. The greatest part is that I don't have to wait forever to get my pictures back, being that the pictures are saved to a floppy  disk. I simply snap the shot, look at the finished product to see if I want  to keep it, and print it out within a matter of a minute of two. For those  of you with new baby's(like my 9 month old), this is awesome. The zoom  function is so good that I am taking the camera to a Laker game tonight to  use as binoculars. I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking to get  into digital imagery.","Not being a computer or camera \"pro\" I needed something easy to use. I looked at the reviews for the product here at Amazon. I decided to buy the F83 model. This model allows for a 15 second \"movie\". Boy  do I like it. I like the ease of the Floppy disk. The quality is fine for  my needs. The battery lasts a long time. A camera bag is a necessity since  the LCD screen marks easily. I recommend the camera to anyone wanting a  digital camera that is easy to use. Thanks Amazon for providing the  reviews, and thanks to those other individuals who made the reviews. I  found them very helpful.","This is my first digital camera, and I love it! Very easy to use. I took awsome pictures of my grandbaby, using the fine resolution,and the portrait mode.With the 10x zoom lens I could get such close-ups! So easy to use the  3.5\" floppy. I had heard that these pictures did not print well! Not  so! I printed dozens of them on glossy photo paper, and have had real  photographers raving about them. I am more pleased than I thought I would  be with this camera. I use it to make pictures to put on all my greeting  cards that I make.  The battery lasts plenty long for a day of shooting,  and recharges rapidly. The large viewscreen lets you see your picture as  soon as you take it. I highly recommend this camera.","This is a fabulous camera.  The fact that it uses standard floppy disks, instead of memory cards or downloading.  This makes it increadibly flexable.  I am very bad about developing film, and this format makes it  easy. Also, if I take a bad picture I can preview and zap it right there.  I took some pictures of my 4 month old son, that I would not have gotten  with a conventional camera.  By the way, it can be really heavy if you wear  it around your neck for a long period of time.<br />The battery life is  pretty good as long as I keep it off until I am ready to take a series of  pictures.  Also, to my surprise, it takes great high speed.  I took a  picture of a race car at full speed, that was beautiful.<br />I have,  however, dropped it once. It killed a couple of my pictures, but I expected  that with a floppy device.  The camera itself is fine.<br />One added bonus  is the battery is exactly the same as my Sony Handycam Camcorder.  Not only  do I have a extra battery now for both, but the included battery charger  charges both quickly and easily.  This also helps justify me purchasing  additional batteries down the road.<br />I don't know what additional features  the step up Sony has, but this has so many features it will satisfy any  intermediate photographer.","This is a great camera!  So much you can do with your photos using your computer.  The floppy disc is the way to go - so fast & simple.  My only criticism is the packaging by Sony.  The adapter for the battery plug  had rolled over to a corner of the box and I couldn't find it until I  started to put everything back in the box...even tho there were 10  instruction books in every language, the English language directions were  vague and you had to use your own computer savvy to know how to  \"format\" your floppys, plus there wasn't a warranty card  enclosed, but I contacted Sony via email and received one in the mail.  But, other than those inconveniences, the camera itself is wonderful.  Good  quality pictures and excellent color & fun, fun, fun!","We bought this camera just before a vacation overseas, andbought an extra battery.  Armed with 50 floppies, we were able to takeunlimited pictures, averaging 15 shots per disk. Cheap\"film,\" total flexibility, no cables.  We deleted a few shots we didn't like and retook them.  The fact that it uses floppies is a major attraction.  Floppies can be used in both Macs and PC's, which facilitates sharing photos.  The 10x zoom compensates for the lower resolution.  Have also used the Mavica for taking pictures of old photos, including those in frames, with very acceptable results.","I read alot of the reviews for this camera before I purchased it. Mostly I was concerned about the pic quality, but decided to get it anyway. It has two main modes: standard and email. Both modes produce fairly good quality  pics, perhaps not suitable for editing, but great for standard utility  shots to send to friends or use in online auctions. It takes the best pics  when the object is well lit; pics are sometimes grainy when taken indoors  with low light. Overall, I'd say that this camera offers what most people  need in a digital camera and I am glad that I didn't spend more. The pics  are high quality, the camera is easy to use, has very high battery life and  lots of functionality. Tip: buy a camera case right away.","my wife and i are writing a guide so people can find all 19th and 20th century water powered mill in minnesota.the sony mvc-fd-73 camera was one of the best investment we made for our project.we can e-mail,edit and  change the way the photo is we can also lift a picture from a book without  any problems.as for the floppy disk there is no better way to store  pictures.as we say take along a lot of floppy disks.we can also charge the  batterys from the van so were are never without power.  tom and barb  neuhaus northfield minnesota.","I loved the Mavica FD73 for 18 months of use. I photograph archtecture for my business and met with a lot of approval. However the resolution is not up to par with what is now available.I upgraded to the Mavica FD91.  Beautiful! Magnificant zoom and many brilliant features. Much better  resolution and now have no need to use digital enhancing for sharpness or  colours. I recommend the FD91","I think in terms of features and benefits. Features are the descriptions listed by the manufacturer. Benefits are how using the product makes you feel.<br />This camera makes me happy!  It's not a 35mm, but I own one of  those and it spends most of its time in the camera bag.  My SonyMav,  though, I want to take *everywhere* for the kick of capturing even the most  familiar and mundane scenes or objects in a new perspective.  I can see the  results instantly. I'm not stuck paying for bad shots and if I decide later  on that I really don't like a picture I can delete it and re-use its space.  I can share pix instantly by copying the diskette on the spot or later on,  by sending pix via email or posting them on the Internet.  Look at the FD73  pictures that are out there on the 'net (we're a proud and happy bunch,  wanting to put 'em all out there on our websites)-- they're breathtaking!<br />A missing feature of this camera, an LCD sun shield, can be made or  purchased inexpensively, as can a scratch guard.  The benefit of having an  LCD viewfinder means you can extend your arms and put the camera places  where you can't or wouldn't want to place your face.  You can take candid  photos without anyone realizing what you're up to because you're holding  the camera down, at or below chest level like you're just checking on  it.<br />As to the features: read them, do your homework on the Internet and  you'll know what you're going to get, including the limitations and  problems.  Delve into it and you'll find out how to overcome those problems  and make the best of the limitations.  Check your wallet, weigh your  options, decide what you want.  There's no law that says you can only have  one camera!","The convenience of floppy disks is hard to beat. No proprietary cables or special setup is required. Even the newer cameras with the USB interface often require their own goofy PhotoSchmuck software to be installed.<br />The  floppy drive enables us to share our pics at any time, even with friends  that have older computers or (God forbid) a Mac. Almost any computer can  read the format-standard JPEG used by the Mavica cameras. You can even dupe  a disk in the middle of nowhere. Try that with a smart card! If you want to  make a living with artful photography look higher up the line, or at the  Olympus 600. If you want to make a living on eBay, or just have fun with  your camera, it's hard to beat the Mavica for convenience and versatility.","This is the first digital camera I have owned.  The best features are the 10x zoom, the removable floppy disks and the great picture quality for my webpage and email. The long life battery is a plus too.  I have hundreds of  35mm color slides from years ago.  As I was looking at these slides one  evening, I set up the Mavica on a tripod and took digital pictures of these  slides.  They turned out great.  Now I can look at them anytime I want to  on my computer or share them with family and friends via email.  I would  absolutely buy another Mavica.","The Sony Mavica was my first color digital camera.  Although I took a lot of pictures with it, I eventually bought another digital camera.  The biggest problems with the Mavica are.<br />1. The resolution - 640 by 480 just  isn't good enough.  If you do any photo editing at all, the quality suffers  because of the low resolution.  You need at least a 1200 by 800-1000  resolution, preferably more.<br />2.  The LCD is too hard to use, especially  in strong light.  You really need a viewfinder.<br />3.  The floppys just  don't store enough.  If you go on vacation, you need to carry a bunch of  extra floppies in your pocket.<br />On the plus  side, the battery life and 10x zoom are great.  But that just doesn't make  up for the weaknesses mentioned  above.  Do your self a favor and get  camera with better resolution - and maybe you'll only have to buy one.<br />P.S. I traded up to a Kodak DC260 and like it fine.","I am a photo/journalist, and this camera is just great for my work. I write for several newspapers in Canada, London, and the USA. And what's even greater, I can also e-mail pictures with my stories. Really, this camera is really great.<br />A must for all newsmen.","I got a Sony MVC-FD73 Mavica Digital Camera for Christmas and have used it a lot since receiving it. It is an excellent camera and I certainly would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a Digital Camera at a reasonable  price.<br />However, a couple of points about the camera. First, the LCD view  finder gets dirty and scratched easily. There should be a cover for it when  not in use. Second, it is almost impossible to see the view finder when  outside in bright sunshine, making it hard to take a picture. Cannot see  what you are viewing. I think it would be nice if Sony had put a regular  view finder on the camera for taking outdoor pictures.","The Mavica series itself hovers over the competition simply because of its rechargeable battery and floppy disks.  The truth is that this camera is all you need save for MPEG feature.  It has a number of special effects, a  great zoom feature, and sequence pics!  Heck, I've just taken a picture  of the computer screen with it and it turned out great.  Word to the wise:  Make sure you avoid nighttime pictures with this camera...very frustrating.","I'm a professional photographer and also use a scanner often in my work. I opted to buy the least expensive Sony Mavica Digital Camera (MVC-FD73) while waiting for a Digital Camera that has everything. I fell in love with  this Sony for uploading photos onto the web. Ease of use with the floppies  is THE ABSOLUTE BEST! I hope Sony continues to produce Digital Cameras that  use floppies or zip...I wouldn't have anything else after this camera. The  zoom feature is great; close ups of the smallest flower is amazing. I just  ordered a 2nd battery so next hurricane I'll photograph all of my 'stuff'  and store it on disks...so easy! I haven't tried making a print from any of  the exposures but for using for web purposes I can't say enough good about  this camera.","Erogramicly correct, user freindly. Uses Floppu Disks, low expense, Has Excellent Zoom Lens, Inexpensive Battery Overll quality is excelent","Easy to use, battery stays charged for a long time, nice LCD display, great zoom, and the convience of using your computer floppy drive. It is a little expensive for 640*480 resolution, and the picture quality could be a little better.","I have used this camera extensively for over a year. I use theMavica almost exclusively for pictures at my web site. Many are shrunkfor quick download times, but you can still see the output quality.<br />After using the MVC-FD73 for this long there are many pros and cons that I have come up with.<br />Pros:<br />1 - easy to use<br />2 - nice LCD viewer for scrolling through previous shots<br />3 - floppies are a very convenient reusable medium<br />Cons:<br />1 - LCD viewer gets scratched easily<br />2 - Viewer LCD hard to see in very strong outdoor light (a better camera would have an interchangeable regular viewfinder AND an LCD viewer)<br />3 - Flash always seems too strong - a lot of red eye incidents indoors<br />4 - Has a hard time focusing in low light<br />5 - Floppies, while convenient, are FAR too small for high res pics. Why Sony hasn't made a Zip Drive or Super Disk drive version is beyond me.<br />In the future I will buy another camera that clears up the problems listed above. It probably won't be a Sony since Sony's pushing proprietary media in their future digital cameras.<br />If you want this camera for the long haul I'd suggest doing a little more homework and being fully aware of the 5 problems I mentioned above before buying this one.","Bought this camera December 31,99 My son got one for Christmas, and I used my christmas money to buy myself one. Looked at the 83, but couldn't resist the 10x zoom for 200.00 less.Very happy with all of the many features.  Highly recommed.","This Sony MVC-FD73 is a really great camera.  It has outstanding zoom abilities that will put you at center stage from as far as 150 ft from the stage, and while holding the camera above the crowds heads.  The only draw  back is, as with most digitals, recording time is slow.  Be prepared to  miss several shots due to slow recording time, but the upside is, you do  not have to down load your pics, just change the disk and keep going. As  far as the price, you can find a better deal at national retail stores and  get availible warranties without the cost or bother of unpredictable  shipping.","I love being able to change disks from use for business to pleasure.  As truckers hauling specialized freight,we are required to take pictures at point of origin and delivery of the load. This saves having many rolls of  film and space to store them. Then to take pictures of scenery, etc. we  just change disks.  The picture quality is great...just perfect for us!","This model is definitely the most easy to use camera available, but it's the digital equivilant of a Polaroid... quick and easy shots, low quality pictures.","I purchased my camera (display model) when a large chain was relocating to a new store for a very good price.  I had been looking for quite some time and a friend had the FD-71 and was very happy with it.  So easy to use a  4th grader could immediately use.  I was not looking for the features that  the FD83 had as I already had a digital video camera.  I really like the  idea of being able to click in a floppy and start shooting and not having  to hook up anything once I get home to start printing out my shots.  The  only disappointment to me is the low resolution.  If you want to print  anything larger than a 4 x 6, you loose the clarity.  On a scale of 1 - 10,  I would rate the SOny Mavica FD-73 a 9","I have had this camera 11 months. It is very easy to handle, zoom is excellent, using ordinary discs is great, battery system fine.  But very often I have been disappointed with the quality of pictures.  There is  simply not enough pixels. Pictures from houses for instance are good  enough, from people so and so, mostly not.  Near shots from flowers look  little bit waxy and stiff but I have taken lots's of them.  Most  disappointments I have had with nature pictures, grass looks odd, too much  details for such a few pixels. If I would have known this I would have  choosen more pixels. Still this has been a great joy and I am hungry for a  new megapixel digital camera.  Before you shop try to see pictures.  For  e-mail and web they are OK.","I first used the camera at work the instant I saw it I wanted one.Having had a baby recently I wanted the conveinience of this wonderful piece of technology. Great for emailing images to family and friends. The lens cap is a problem and the lcd screen but great for indoor work and playing  around with the images in photoshop 5 is wonderful. An amazing piece of  technology. Unfortunately the close up lenses advertised on the box are not  available in Australia.","Unbelievable product for the price or at any price! Easy touse, great quality, uses the floppy disc..totally bonus. I use it formy web site and get great results. Great for home use..I  could go on and on!","This is simply a great product that never forgets what it can do best.  No, it is not the best, most fully-featured digital camera on the market.  But it must surely be the simplest to use, with a price-to-quality ratio  that's off the scale. I had become increasingly concerned that life's  everyday events were passing me by unrecorded--you know the kind of events  that one might like to look back on, but that are simply not worth the  hassle and expense of traditional film processing. This camera is a  Recorder of Life. Light, simple, and good quality pictures. The rechargable  battery lives long, and floppy discs make archiving so easy.  A must-have!","I bought this model over the higher-resolution Sony versions, and I'm very satisfied. If you want 1024x768 pictures, go ahead and spend the extra money. But this one does just great. The ability to pop in a fresh diskette  and keep shooting is addictive. Preview and delete shots easily. Remarkably  good battery life. The 10x zoom is amazing, will blow you away. I've used  it to document everything from the wiring and hoses on my sailboat to  furniture we might want to add to our home. Incredibly convenient, simple  to use. One thing to watch for: bright sunlight behind you can wash out the  LCD display so it's hard to see what you're shooting. So just find some  shade or reposition your shot. Only if you're stuck in the Sahara is it  that a big deal.  Highly recommended, you'll love it.","Its Amazing! You simply throw a disk in, take up to 40 pictures per disk, then slide it into your computers disk drive. And you don't even NEED a computer. You easily put a phone cord into the camera and use its email  mode. And the best part: You can view your pictures right from the screen  and delete them. Think of all of those horrible pictures you spend money to  get developed. And also you don't get it developed, just use your comp. And  it runs in a jpg format that practicly everyone has. You don't need to  install software to view your pictures!","I purchased the Sony MavicaMVC-FD73 on the 4th of July. Wonderful gift!  I cannot find enough pictures to take.  The zoom is awesome. the pictures print up good enough for framing. The battery life is a plus, the floppy  disk is a plus.  I only wish the camera were alittle smaller.  I am very  pleased with this camera.","Once the battery pack is charged, you are taking pictures almost as soon as the pack is inserted into camera. The only set-up is the date and time. The menus are simple to understand. The fact that the pictures are saved to  a 3.5\" disk is of course a huge plus. I couldn't be more pleased.","I bought the first Mavica model issued and have been very pleased indeed with it.  With its convenient zoom lens and excellent automatic focussing and exposure, it produces superb results.  I did suggest to Sony that they  develop some kind of folding hood for the large \"view finder\" as  it is difficult to see the image if the sun is shining on it (and it  usually is, because you normally take photos with the sun behind you.) They  did not deign to respond!","I've taken about 300 pictures using this camera. The color photos are very good, but the real power of this camera is its sepia setting (i.e. takes \"old\" style B&W photos with a touch of yellow). They are  really SUPERB, and has gotten me taking photos of everyone. Best points: -  uses regular diskettes, so easy and cheap. - no-brainer to use. - top notch  photos all round. - great price.","The Sony Mavica is a extremely easy camera to use. The only thing you have to do in the begging is set the date and time and you are ready use the camera. And you get create picture results.

The Sony MVC-FD83 camera arrived exactly as described; excellent condition. I've found it very easy to use.  I prefer the simplicity of using a floppy disc rather than the memory stick.  Take the disc out of the camera and pop it into the computer and PRESTO - I've got GREAT pictures to print or email.  No more picture developing costs!  I contacted the seller by email before purchasing the camera.  David answered all my questions promptly and in great detail.  I HIGHLY recommend him. It was a pleasant shopping experience.

I own it and totally recommend the quality the easy of use and the size.","I love this camera, I use it alot and think it is fantastic. Love the features and the ease of use.","Good camera with easy viewing on a computer using floppy disks.  I was even able to get more \"film\" in Cartegena, Columbia.  Just ask for \"diskettes\".  The LCD display can be hard to see if bright sun is shining on it, but point and click and you can see the picture as it records on the disk in the shade of your body.  If you want to see the image for a longer time just slide the mode switch from \"Still\" to \"Play\" and see all the images taken so far.  Slide the switch to Movie and take MPG digital movie clips with sound.  These too can be reviewed with sound in just seconds after recording on disk.  The sound is as good as my 8 mm video camera.

The Sony MVC-FD83 camera arrived exactly as described; excellent condition. I've found it very easy to use.  I prefer the simplicity of using a floppy disc rather than the memory stick.  Take the disc out of the camera and pop it into the computer and PRESTO - I've got GREAT pictures to print or email.  No more picture developing costs!  I contacted the seller by email before purchasing the camera.  David answered all my questions promptly and in great detail.  I HIGHLY recommend him. It was a pleasant shopping experience.  Thank You Amazon.com and Thank You David.","Sony Made great strides with this camera. I own it and totally recommend the quality the easy of use and the size.","I love this camera, I use it alot and think it is fantastic.

When I said floppy disks were expensive, I  meant on a per-magabyte basis. For my example, I'll use the Iomega Clik!  disk (40 MB) A floppy disk usually costs about a dollar and a half (when  bought by itself). A Clik! disk costs $15 dollars by itself. You need to  buy 27 3 1/2 floppy disks to equal a Clik!. That's $25 more, thus making  the floppy disk less cost-efficient.  (To be fair, I'll counteract my own  case. I know people buy floppies in bulk, but you can do the same with the  Clik!'s, CompactFlashes, and SmartMedia cards. Also, there's the issue of  buying the $150 Clik! Drive, but after buying 6 disks, it pays for  itself.)<br />This is another product that could ONLY sell in America, where  we put convienience over quality and [cost-]effeciency. This camera was  great a couple years ago, but now, as floppies are starting to die (but it  will still take a few years), the technology is getting stale. I know Kodak  and Olympus are selling some really great cameras from last year for  sub-$200 prices.<br /> Of course, for the person new to digital imaging AND  computers, this (overpriced) camera may be the way to go...if you've tries  d a competitor's effort and have hated it.<br /> REMEMBER: Digital Cameras are  a must ONLY for people who regularly need images on a computer. You can  always have a film developer put your 35mm film on disk, or scan your 35mm  pictures or negatives with a scanner.","Don't believe the person in the previous message.  Megapixel mode (1216x912) will result in 4 to 7 images on a standard floppy disk depending upon the complexity of the image.  1024x768 mode results in 7 to 10 photos  on a disk.  640x480 mode results in 14 to 20+ photos on the disk.  The max  resolution stated on Amazon is not 1024x768 (that's an error that needs  correcting).  The camera takes very nice 5, 10, or 15 second MPG movies in  either 160x120 or 320x200 mode.  I've had this camera for three months now  and carry it with me everywhere, along with a box of disks.  At the minimum  I keep a fresh disk in the camera.  With a rechargable battery that I've  used full blast taking photos on 25+ disks for two hours, you can't beat  it.  Memory sticks are convenient as you won't have to unload and reload  your camera, but nothing beats being able to take the disk out of the  camera, hand it to someone, and be done with it.  They can pop that disk  into any PC or Mac and view the contents without going through any memory  stick download process at all.  What I do hope is that Sony picks up on the  SuperDisk 120-MB floppy technology and incorporates it into their next line  of cameras.  That should resolve any \"not enough space on a disk\"  issues.  But for now, it's fun and I'm very happy with my camera.","This is a great camera.  I was using it right out of the box, after charging the battery for an hour.  The controls are very easy to use and understand.  The camera comes with a rechargable battery and charger, no more batteries to buy great move sony.  The camera displays the status of  the battery, disk space and number of pictures on the disk.  Oh did I  mention that the camera uses regular 3 1/2 floppy disk. You can view the  pictures right on the camera one at a time or view them in the index mode,  where you view the pictures six at a time.  You can also connect the camera  to your tv or vcr and let the camera do it's thing, by creating a slide  show.  You can also review the pictures and delete any one that you don't  want.  And another great feature is it creates a html document on the disk  with links to each picture that's on the disk, what a great idea.  I have a  son six and a daughter eight and they started using the camera without any  instructions now that's easy.  The pictures are great the detail in the  pictures are out of sight.","I purchased the FD-83 after having borrowed my father's FD-81 off and on for several months.  Unfortunately, my FD-83 had a technical problem (autofocus always mis-focused) which required me to return it for repairs  under warranty. I live in the Boston area and so there is a Sony repair  station nearby.  They made good on the warranty and since that time it has  serviced us well.<br />The picture resolution is slightly less than you'll  find on other digital cameras **BUT** the convenience of diskettes (to me)  far outweighs any resolution or storage issues.  Someone mentioned that  diskettes are expensive.  You can purchase a 100-pack at any office supply  house for around $20, so I really don't consider 20 cents per diskette as  being costly.<br />If you use the standard resolution, which I find myself  doing most of the time, I get around 20 pics on a floppy.  What I have  found as an unexpected convenient bonus is the copy feature -- you can make  multiple copies of photos or photo-diskettes on the spot.  This is handy  when you are on vacation or visiting people.  And, of course, 3.5 inch  diskettes are available anywhere.  When going on an outing I carry five or  six.  This enables me to snap 100 pics for around a buck, and this assumes  I never reuse the diskettes.<br />While the higher resolution pics and  *.mpg features are nice and probably were effective at convincing me to  purchase this,  I realize now I almost never use those features.  I also  refrain from using the digital zoom and stay within the 3:1 optical zoom  range.  If I had a longer optical zoom, I would use that, and Sony has made  inroads on that in their higher models.<br />From using the older FD-81, I  also used MGI Photosuite as the software, which is what Sony used to  distribute with their cameras.  The FD-83 I have came with different  software (ArcSoft with Polaroid PhotoMax) that has more features but I find  myself preferring the MGI package more or Microsoft Photo Editor. I just  personally find those easier to use.<br />All in all, do I recommend this?  YES.  I did see other cameras that took better pictures, but how much  clarity do you need on a 19-inch screen?  Or an 8 x 10 printed photo?  This  does the job adequately.  And the general ease of use, as well as having  diskette media convenience makes this worth using.<br />If I really want  super-sharp pictures that I would display in a slide show on a 15 foot  screen - I can reach for my trusty Canon AE-1 35MM camera.  But for general  use, the FD-83 is my plaything now.","I was so surprised at the ease of use of this camera-I opened the box and was quite intimidated by the instruction book- I was up and running in no time-- I invested in the camera case after reading these reviews about no  cap for the LCD- I just purchased the sony photo printer for this camera  and am anxious to receive it-- I do a lot of crafts and this camera is  perfect for transferring pictures on greeting cards, stickers etc..Buy one  You will Love it!","The Sony MVC FD83 is excellent for the Novice to Intermediate photographer. With its high resolution 1280x960 the photos are veru high in quality at this price. I rsearched digital cameras for about a month online and at retail stores. You cant beat this camera and what it has to offer with this price range. MPEG short voice clips and all you need is a 3.5 floppy. No expensive FlashRam to buy for the other brands of cameras. I was hesitant to buy Sony outside of TV's(they are the best) but I am very happy I went with the Sony. Dont Buy the FD71/73 because it doesnt offer as much as the FD81/83/91 models","I bought this camera just a couple of days back and I am totally satisfied. Its the coolest digital camera available. I recommend it for anyone who is not a professional photographer.","I'm a wildlife artist and always hated the hassle of waiting for film developing (and the expense).  I need images quick and a lot of them.  The FD83 just fullfulled all my expectations.  The limited storage on the floppy is not a problem....I just keep a lot of them handy.  I can reel off  the images I need, edit them, and store them for future reference.<br />The  resolution, while some say is lower quality, seems pretty great as well.  I  can actually take digital photos of paintings or prints and get immediate  good prints to send to perspective clients or even print out on a good  photorealistic printer for mini art prints (but be sure it's on good paper  and with good ink).  While the Fd8s has it limitations (you can do better  with twice the money!), it serves every purpose for me.","I bought my Sony Mavica FD-83 for Christmas and I am totally satisfied with it, I was quite surprised how well the pictures came out, I would recommend the camera to anyone looking for professional pictures with the  ease of an instamatic","This camera is great for the web.  The camera's compression is good.  It's options are very helpful.  The camera can be easily manipulated without searching around the instruction book.  If you are not a professional  photographer this is all you need for a \"photo album\".  The FD91  model has excellent shutter speed for you experts.","If you want standard-sized prints, this is a great camera.  If you want web or computer images, it is an excellent camera.  If you want professional prints, get a 35mm film camera.  I have all but replaced my  35mm for almost all my photo uses.  Once you learn the quirks of exposure  settings, you can get excellent quality images in a wide range of lighting  conditions - in spite of what others have said.  Don't rely too much on the  supplied manual - you have to experiment - but since you're not 'wasting  film', you can afford to.  I find the floppy storage to be very convenient.  The ONLY drawback I find is the inability to stop fast action without  blurred images.","This is a well-engineered camera: its feature set, build quality, interface, battery life, optics, and ergonometrics are all top-notch. It is a joy to use and produces high-quality pictures for web site or small  photorealistic prints, especially if you use the \"fine\" mode that  imposes less jpeg compression.<br />There is also a thriving Mavican  community on the 'net, and lots of useful freeware shareware, and  third-party accessories. If you need to print out 8X10 photorealistic  prints, buy a 2 megapixel camera; for everything short of this, the Mavica  83 is a superb camera. Unlike other reviewers, I find that this camera does  a respectable job in low-light situations.<br />One drawback is the optical  zoom, which is \"only\" 3X. Sony's high-quality teleconverter  (~$50) will increase this to 6X. Its use of 1.4mb floppy disk storage  hasn't been a drawback for me: the 4X floppy drive is quick, it is easy to  change floppies, and one floppy holds a respectable number of images  (around 8 in 1024X768 fine mode, around 20 in 640X480 fine mode).<br />The  brief MPEG movies are great fun, and an easy way to create video e-mail or  to add streaming video web sites.<br />For the price, I'd prefer this  high-quality .8 megapixel camera to the \"bargain\" 2 megapixel  cameras, which may have inferior optics.<br />My conclusion: Don't believe the  hype about the \"need\" for 2 megapixel cameras. For e-mail, web,  and smaller prints, the Mavica 83 occupies a great \"sweet spot:\"  it combines many higher-end features with superior ease-of-use,  convenience, and optics.","My company need a digital camera for maintain progress photos of our projects. After looking at cameras from other vendors and trying cameras that our other departments were using our group decided upon the Mavica mainly because of the floppy drive. Overall, we have been delighted with  the camera except for the fact that it is limited to daytime usage. In dim  light conditions one has to be almost on top of the subject or the result  is too dark. In addition, we found that the LCD screen was easily scratched  by shirt buttons when the camera was carried on the strap around the neck.  Also in the year of ownership we have had a floppy drive failure.  Be aware  that free labor charges end after 90 days and the normal charge is $ for  repair. The parts are free within the first year of ownership. In  conclusion, for daylight outdoor scenes or indoor scenes with the right  lighting conditions this is a good camera. And for multiple users the  floppy drive is efficient.","I bought my camera in March of this year. I am a real estate agent and I have to say this camera was ideal in aiding and promoting my business. The images it took were sharp and clear.  I took both interior and exterior  shots of homes and with very little effort I could print up a promotional  highlight sheet, which was both professional and impressive.  The camera  was easy to use and the floppy disk is a very versatile way to obtain the  quick results I required. It is a good buy.","I can't help but rave about Sony Mavica FD-83's versatility!  It has auto/manual focus, digital zoom, four different picture effects including black & white, 2 image quality modes, and it can also record a short  video with voice.  You'd wonder if you have to be a hi-tech guru to operate  a camera loaded with features.  Not so!  This camera is soooo easy to use  that I didn't even have to read the manual to make it work the first time I  got it.  I just popped in a floppy disk, took pictures, took the floppy out  and into my computer and presto! QUALITY pictures right before your eyes!  Of course, after finally reading the manual, I found out about the other  wonderful features of FD-83.  My favorite is the \"E-mail\" setting  which automatically makes a copy of the pictures you take in a much smaller  file size and therefore,  cuts the upload and download times of the  pictures you send through email.  No more playing around with your pictures  to reduce the file size, it's all done for you!  There's more to this  camera than I have space to write about them for.  Read the other reviews.  I highly recommend the Sony Mavica FD-83 ... IT IS WORTH IT!","used this camera first time on thanksgiving this year.was able to operate with ease and show others.placed them on the hosts computor and everyone loved the instant viewing.easy to operate and hold. pictures above  expectations.","After buying a Sony Vaio F290 notebook, and being completely thrilled with it, my next step was to study up, and learn about digital cameras. I've been doing photography for years, but am not a professional. I have had my  Mavica 83 for just one month, but the real thrill was taking it out onto  the beach, two hours after bringing it home, and easily taking my first 2  floppies full of pictures! The menu is easily understandable, and the  quality of the pictures I've taken, is excellent. The 6x digital zoom is  also excellent for most shots. I love being able to copy the contents of  one full disk onto another (to share) right in the camera's 4x drive. I'd  heard negative reviews, concerning it only having the LCD, but with a bit  of practice, this becomes second nature. All LCD's have some problems with  & in the sun, but if you know how to set up your shot, this isn't a  problem. The flash is very stark/bright in & on your photo. It's so  much fun and very easy sending pictures by email! I think everyone in my  family will probably be buying a digital for Christmas! I went to several  stores, to pick up, handle and move around with the menu's, of all the  camera's I could find. I recommend you do this too, if you're going to buy  one. Some camera's just don't feel right in your hands. The controls on  this camera are conveniently placed. I have a couple \"newspaper\"  writing friends, and they tell me, they use Mavica 83's from the office  too. That seemed good enough for me! The only thing I am not satisfied  with, is the battery life. Yes, I'm turning off my LCD too, in hopes of  extending it, but, the battery doesn't have the stated minutes life. The  macro is also excellent, and can really catch some interesting views. There  are cheaper cameras, and getting more powerful by the week, but for now, I  highly recommend the Mavica 83. Being able to use floppies as film, is  great, as you can share these with anyone, and it's the cheapest way to go.  My only wish is that they had included a cap / protective cover, for the  LCD.","The only problem is the viewfinder in hot sunlight, being an elderly it's hard to see when you try to take a picture in bright sunlight on the outside, living in Florida. An additional Optic View finder would very much  appreciated.","After much consideration, stalling and browsing I decided on the Mavica FD83. I've found it a most useful, acceptable quality camara useful internet features, one can make and send a 15sec 320 X 240 mpeg video clip  in a  few minutes. it also records in small frame X3 15sec video clips,  internet ready,on a single floppy. Stills with 40sec audio. All around I'm  pleased and plan to use it for many years. High res only 3-4 pictures per  floppy otherwise up to 20 pictures per floppy. Worth the money  really...though not I suppose the very best for the hi-tech professional. I  like the floppy system, quick and easy to file and view.","If you are looking for a convenient, smart and easy to use camara. This is it, while resolution is not as good as other camaras, if you need it for web applications its good enough. One very good feature, at least for me,  is its great macro capability and manual focus. You can take objects as  close as 1 cm. You can also control the exposure level which for close  distance shots is a very usefull feature. But the best feature for me is  the fact that it stores in floppy disks. This is a convenient storage media  and while the storage capacity is not big, they are so cheap you can buy as  many as you need. Overall I'm very happy with it, I strongly recommend it."]},{"name":"Sony Mavica FD-88","amazon_reviews":["ok","Awesome!

The sofware is fun and easy to use.  The camera takes wonderful pictures and  the LCD is true to life.  I especially like the USB hookup which is great  for me since I am using this camera with a superslim laptop. and the  batteries provided with the camera are dead.  I am on my way tomorrow to  get rechargeables and suggest you do the same before you receive this  camera if you plan on using it for more than 12 pictures on the first day.","There is no doubt about it; this is a great camera to discover the virtues (and limitations) of digital photography. The interface, a menu system given via a LCD, is easy to understand and use, though in bright sun light  the LCD can be nearly impossible to see. The camera's main problem, as many  have mentioned, is battery use. The camera comes supplied with batteries  (wow!) but since this camera is such a joy to use, you'll likely go through  them on your way to the store to buy the NiMH rechargeables that you'll  need. I purchased a 13hr charger and 8 AA NiMH batteries for $40.00 at  Radio Shack.<br />The advantage of the digital is that I've been taking many  many more \"memory\" shots of my life with this camera then I ever did using  the traditional chemistry based system. Another advantage is that the LCD  lets you review the pictures right after taking the image. This can be a  great feature at parties and the like. When it comes to a traditional  camera, the outlay of the many dollars and the amount of time between shot  taken and shot realized was too costly for me to take many pictures.<br />The  disadvantages of digital cameras, at least at this cost level, are  resolution (you really cannot beat the old system yet) and image control  (focus, f-stop, zoom, etc.) but maybe I just haven't discovered those  aspects of the camera yet.<br />All in all, a great \"new to digital\" camera  coupled with a great place to buy it. Amazon.com treated me very well when  I had some problems with the order. I highly recommend them.","After searching fruitlessly for months for this camera's cheaper little brother, the ePhoto 780c, I decided to spend the extra $100 and get this one instead.  I'm happy I made the choice-- this camera has MUCH higher  resolution, a very nice in-camera user interface (it's remarkably easy to  set the focus and flash and step through your pictures on the camera's LCD  screen)and great connectivity features-- it handles CompactFlash memory  nicely, and has both serial and USB (the BEST! ) connection options.  I  easily hooked it up to both my PC and my Mac; it's a snap.<br />There's only  one problem, and it's a big one: this guy gobbles batteries like crazy.  If  you're using the flash and LCD viewfinder to frame your pictures, expect to  burn through a set of 4 AA batteries in about 35 minutes.  Using the  optical viewfinder and remembering to use the flash judiciously (this  camera handles low light well, even without the flash) will extend battery  life, but even so, you'll only get about 3-4 hours of life out of each set  of batteries, MAX.  The solution is to get a set or three of NiMH (nickel  metal hydride) batteries and a charger; particularly, if you're getting  this camera as a gift, throw the batteries and charger in!

The  picture seems really nice to me. The sad stuff about the camera is it eats  batteries like a horse. My brand new 4 AA batteries were sucked in 30 mins.  I couldn't quite figure out where in the world the energy had been gone to.  I am gonna buy some rechargeable batteries to kill this problem. Oh, ha, no  underwear for the lens.

The defections, huh, are kinda  unreasonable. There is no cover on the lens. You have to take very good  care of the lens. Other wise, you know... And it is a real batteries-eating  dinosaur.

You'll  like it.","\"~I recieved this camera today and although it's my first venture into digital imagery, I was taking and viewing pictures in 15 minutes.  The sofware is fun and easy to use.  The camera takes wonderful pictures and  the LCD is true to life.  I especially like the USB hookup which is great  for me since I am using this camera with a superslim laptop. and the  batteries provided with the camera are dead.  I am on my way tomorrow to  get rechargeables and suggest you do the same before you receive this  camera if you plan on using it for more than 12 pictures on the first day.","There is no doubt about it; this is a great camera to discover the virtues (and limitations) of digital photography. The interface, a menu system given via a LCD, is easy to understand and use, though in bright sun light  the LCD can be nearly impossible to see. The camera's main problem, as many  have mentioned, is battery use. The camera comes supplied with batteries  (wow!) but since this camera is such a joy to use, you'll likely go through  them on your way to the store to buy the NiMH rechargeables that you'll  need. I purchased a 13hr charger and 8 AA NiMH batteries for $40.00 at  Radio Shack.<br />The advantage of the digital is that I've been taking many  many more \"memory\" shots of my life with this camera then I ever did using  the traditional chemistry based system. Another advantage is that the LCD  lets you review the pictures right after taking the image. This can be a  great feature at parties and the like. When it comes to a traditional  camera, the outlay of the many dollars and the amount of time between shot  taken and shot realized was too costly for me to take many pictures.<br />The  disadvantages of digital cameras, at least at this cost level, are  resolution (you really cannot beat the old system yet) and image control  (focus, f-stop, zoom, etc.) but maybe I just haven't discovered those  aspects of the camera yet.<br />All in all, a great \"new to digital\" camera  coupled with a great place to buy it. Amazon.com treated me very well when  I had some problems with the order. I highly recommend them.","After searching fruitlessly for months for this camera's cheaper little brother, the ePhoto 780c, I decided to spend the extra $100 and get this one instead.  I'm happy I made the choice-- this camera has MUCH higher  resolution, a very nice in-camera user interface (it's remarkably easy to  set the focus and flash and step through your pictures on the camera's LCD  screen)and great connectivity features-- it handles CompactFlash memory  nicely, and has both serial and USB (the BEST! ) connection options.  I  easily hooked it up to both my PC and my Mac; it's a snap.<br />There's only  one problem, and it's a big one: this guy gobbles batteries like crazy.  If  you're using the flash and LCD viewfinder to frame your pictures, expect to  burn through a set of 4 AA batteries in about 35 minutes.  Using the  optical viewfinder and remembering to use the flash judiciously (this  camera handles low light well, even without the flash) will extend battery  life, but even so, you'll only get about 3-4 hours of life out of each set  of batteries, MAX.

Shortly after installing the software in the computer and connecting the camera, the batteries got very hot and it ceased working permanently. The first (and only) pictures I took were of far greater quality than my old digital camera. In other words, while it was working, I was very pleased. But obviously, there are some quality problems","I thought it was a mistake when a friend told me about he features this camera had at this price. This is my second camera, my first being a Vivitar vivicam 2700 (which I paid $349. for) Which was very difficult to hook up and download pictures. This AGFA with its USB connection could not  have been easier. And the picture quality!  My Vivitar was 640x480 this is  better than twice as good!

For example, I can not control the exposure time and it does  not come with different flash modes or zoom functionality. The exposure  time isn't really necessary since the camera takes care of it very well. In  low light I have to hold the camera still or else the image may be blurred.  I usually do not use the flash with this camera because it is overpowering  and I can usually get away without it (and adjust the image later on the  computer). I don't usually photographed people so I haven't had a problem  with red-eye.

The zoom works easily and the optical viewfinder means I never have the battery run down during a day of shooting.  But...Fuji uses an odd TIFF file system when taking umcompressed photos and regular software won't read the file.  You have to use the Fuji software and convert the file to JPEG.  Their software is not user-friendly.  Fortunately, I rarely take TIFF images.  The JPEG images at the 1 megabyte level are fine for anything but portrait work.  Excellent construciton and excellent color rendition. I've used the camera for a year and will soon upgrade to a 5 megapixel unit, keeping this as a second camera.  One really irritating thing:  The \"close-up\" setting does not go back to default when the camera is turned off, which can ruin a lot of pictures if you're not careful to turn the \"close-up\" off when done taking close-ups.<br />With that exception, the controls are easy to operate and the camera has served me well.","Dear Fuji !<br />First I would like to say , that the MX2900 has been a great camera at a great price for me . I purchased one... for myself and my job.  I am currently the Internet Manager for Mancari's Chrysler Plymouh Jeep in Oak Lawn IL . I have used the camera for taking auto photos and many other different projects.<br />The Fuji MX2900 Digital Camera is extremely  easy to setup and use altogether . It has a very nice \"Chrome metal\" look and is also very lightweight. The pictures it takes are excellent !...<br />Even though I know there may be better cameras out there , I still rate this one a 10 in my book of Best Cameras.

I bought it because it has a lot of manual controls that my first camera, Agfa CL50, doesn't have. Fuji introduced this canera near the end of 1999 so its price has dropped quite a bit since then. I really like its design. The hand grid and the solid metal feel make it so comfortable in my hand. Built in hot shoe is a big plus that I can attach an external flash light. It has a 2.4 mega pixels CCD which is more than enough for my use. Image quality is good and nicely exposed. It has a full control of all shutter speeds but only two settings for aperture (4 and 8) which is the only thing I disappointed. And that's why I give it a four instead of five stars. Anyway it is a very nicely built camera in a very attractive price. All control buttons are in good positions. Oh, lastly the rechargeable battery last for quite a while after a full charge. Except it is quite pricy!","Being a stickler for value, flexibility, operating costs, and above all appearance and ease, I admit this camera has it all. My first digital camera, carefully selected after months of research on C/net, auction sites, consumer reviews, amazon reviews, I am so happy that I chose the Fuji MX 2900. I have seen cameras from Olympus and Sony, but they couldn't come up to my expectations.<br />The three reasons why I concluded with a 4-star rating is: 1) The lens cap w/strap is a bad idea. It really is a problem putting it back on the lens after you have switched off the power. 2) The LCD screen is quite dim when composing shots. However, the actual shots are amazingly clear. 3) The Serial port is S L O W. Buy a SanDisk USB card reader for under $40 from anywhere.<br />By the way, the included 8MB Card is good enough for an occasional photographer. It can take 141 standard, 89 normal, 17 Fine, and 2 Hi quality shots. I took 17 fine shots at the fist go and they are incredible for potraits. Now, I am sticking to normal quality.<br />Also, the in-built flash is sufficient for most purposes, and I don't agree investing in an external flash unit at this time.<br />I am still experimenting with the manual operation. So far I am already amazed with the Auto mode.Finally, the quality of color reproduction is probably the best in class.<br />Way to go...FUJI.!!","Before I buy anything, I do lots of research.  I did my homework on this camera and am greatly satisfied by the results.  I am amazed at all the useful features.  The 3X optical zoom and the 1800X1200 resolution of the pictures make it one of the few great cameras in its price range.  The ability to shoot pictures using the manual as well as the automatic mode, make it an excellent camera for the person who has been using traditional SLRs and wants to move into the digital age.  The quality of the color in the photos is brilliant and nearly exactly like natural colors.  When I print 8X10 photos, the pictures have sharp resolution.  I use a USB SmartMedia card reader.  I am able to download the pictures to my PC in literally seconds.  With a 32 meg. SmartMedia card, I can store 36 photos shooting at 1800X1200 resolution. This is my second digital still camera in two years and I am greatly satisfied with it.  I have recommended it to three friends who also now own the camera and love using it.","I've had my MX2900 for about 3 weeks now and I love it!  It's easy to use and takes great photos at high resolution and low resolution.  The optical zoom is great.  I can't believe how clear it is.  There aren't many camera's out there in this price range that have the features this camera packs.  One of the main things I like about it is all the manual options it gives you.  If you like to play with shutter speed and lighting, this camera is for you!  It also has great special effects built in too.<br />The only downside I've noticed to this camera is the serial connection for downloading your pics.  This can be fixed by buying a USB card reader.  It would have been nice if they had thrown in a 16mb smartcard too.  Don't let these little problems keep you away from this camera.<br />All in all, I'd say I'm a very satisfied Fuji owner.","For my first digital camera, this was a pretty big investment so I took my time reading all of the reviews and looking over all of the specs before committing to buying this camera.  First off, some items that might be worthwhile to mention.  Since the description of the product is so detailed, I thought I'd give a list of what is actually included in the box.<br />Mx-2900 Camera, 8mb Smartmedia Card (3.3V), Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery, AC adapter (you can plug it into the camera to charge the battery), Serial transfer cable for both PC and (what looks like) Mac, Video out cable (for displaing what's on the LCD to a TV), Lens Cap, Wrist Strap, CD of Software (image editing software and drivers to transfer images to the computer), manuals and etc.<br />What it lacks is a carrying case and I have to admit, transfering images via serial cable is quite slow.  I haven't gotten so frustrated at the speed as to go buy a card reader, but to transfer a 640x480 image at highest compression takes about 7 seconds.  The 8 meg card fits 144 of those, so a full card can take a while.<br />The image quality is wonderful, I show my friends the pictures I've taken and they comment on how professional looking the pictures seem (colors are vibrant, images are sharp, 1800x1200 max resolution) and I am no professional photographer.  The zoom isn't great in terms of power (3x optical and 2.5x digital) but there is minimal distortion when using the optical zoom.  The flash is powerful enough for most uses but there is a hotshoe for the addition of an external flash.  As well as a lot of automatic features that let you point and shoot, there is a manual mode where you can adjust exposure, flash, white balance among other nifty features I am still playing with.  The case is sturdy and it feels comfortable in my hand, and it looks really nice compared to some of the other cameras on the market.  The battery life is great (for me), I've taken 70 pictures without flash or LCD and the battery had over half its life still left.  Overall, for a thrifty spender like me, I have no regrets spending $500 on this wonderful camera.","This camera was knocked out of my son's hand by a ceiling fan onto our basement floor, fell out of my shirt pocket onto a concrete sidewalk  outside the National Cathedral in DC, and has otherwise been bumped, dropped, and generally mistreated for going on two years, and it still takes pictures -- that with the right printer, paper, and software -- I can blow up all the way to 11X14 inches with true photo quality.  There isn't enough good I can say about this camera. Of course, it's no longer a current model, but at the prices available today -- and assuming you use a card reader of some kind to download pictures from the smart media cards -- it's still a great camera for the money.","I purchased this camera almost two years ago, and I am well satisfied with it. I use a hp1000 printer with it and only hp premium plus glossy or matte paper. The pictures are magnificent, I have printed some of my pictures for comparison on much more expensive printers none so far have been better than mine.<br />The only thing I have against it,is that it didn't come with a leather carrying case. If one is made specially for the mx2900 I am not aware of it. If there is one made how do I get one?","I can not find a bad thing to say about this camera! If I was to look for an area for improvement I think it would have to be: Better ability to take wide angle pictures. Other than that I love it.","I love the camera.  The zoom works easily and the optical viewfinder means I never have the battery run down during a day of shooting.  But...Fuji uses an odd TIFF file system when taking umcompressed photos and regular software won't read the file.  You have to use the Fuji software and convert the file to JPEG.  Their software is not user-friendly.  Fortunately, I rarely take TIFF images.  The JPEG images at the 1 megabyte level are fine for anything but portrait work.  Excellent construciton and excellent color rendition. I've used the camera for a year and will soon upgrade to a 5 megapixel unit, keeping this as a second camera.  One really irritating thing:  The \"close-up\" setting does not go back to default when the camera is turned off, which can ruin a lot of pictures if you're not careful to turn the \"close-up\" off when done taking close-ups.<br />With that exception, the controls are easy to operate and the camera has served me well.","Dear Fuji !<br />First I would like to say , that the MX2900 has been a great camera at a great price for me . I purchased one... for myself and my job.  I am currently the Internet Manager for Mancari's Chrysler Plymouh Jeep in Oak Lawn IL . I have used the camera for taking auto photos and many other different projects.<br />The Fuji MX2900 Digital Camera is extremely  easy to setup and use altogether . It has a very nice \"Chrome metal\" look and is also very lightweight. The pictures it takes are excellent !...<br />Even though I know there may be better cameras out there , I still rate this one a 10 in my book of Best Cameras. I have looked at the Fuji 4900 model , and this one is \"smokin\"!<br />Thanks  Tammy Mandlke / Danbury, WI.<br />T_Mandlke@msn.com","This is my second digital camera. I bought it because it has a lot of manual controls that my first camera, Agfa CL50, doesn't have. Fuji introduced this canera near the end of 1999 so its price has dropped quite a bit since then. I really like its design. The hand grid and the solid metal feel make it so comfortable in my hand. Built in hot shoe is a big plus that I can attach an external flash light. It has a 2.4 mega pixels CCD which is more than enough for my use. Image quality is good and nicely exposed. It has a full control of all shutter speeds but only two settings for aperture (4 and 8) which is the only thing I disappointed. And that's why I give it a four instead of five stars. Anyway it is a very nicely built camera in a very attractive price. All control buttons are in good positions. Oh, lastly the rechargeable battery last for quite a while after a full charge. Except it is quite pricy!","Being a stickler for value, flexibility, operating costs, and above all appearance and ease, I admit this camera has it all. My first digital camera, carefully selected after months of research on C/net, auction sites, consumer reviews, amazon reviews, I am so happy that I chose the Fuji MX 2900. I have seen cameras from Olympus and Sony, but they couldn't come up to my expectations.<br />The three reasons why I concluded with a 4-star rating is: 1) The lens cap w/strap is a bad idea. It really is a problem putting it back on the lens after you have switched off the power. 2) The LCD screen is quite dim when composing shots. However, the actual shots are amazingly clear. 3) The Serial port is S L O W.

It has alot of great features, is easy to use and makes great pictures. In my opinion, Olympus has the best digital cameras handsdown.<br />I've seen a couple of reviews saying the D-340R was slow in downloading to the computer - I think that must depend on your computer since I've had no problem with this.  As far as draining batteries - it is a wise investment to purchase a battery charger and a couple of sets of rechargeable batteries.  They last alot longer and can be purchased for about ... for the charger and ... per 4 pack of batteries (I got mine at Target).  I think both the download speed and battery usage are universal with ALL digital cameras.<br />My next digital camera will definately be an Olympus.","I have owned an Olympus 340 for two years and I've been very happy with it...but I recently upgrade to the Olympus 3040 because the 340 just couldn't give me the print-quality I was looking for!  Frame a photo from the 340 and you can tell it is a digital photo.  Frame a photo from the 3040 and you would never know it was digital!  So, I love this camera and it was a great camera for me to learn about digital photography and to see if I liked a digital camera more than my old 35mm.  But, two years later, I've found the need to upgrade.  However, due to the significant price jump, the comparisons to the 3040 are not totally fair!  So I still give the 340 a rating of 5 stars because for the price I think it is a great option!","I'm new to all this digital camera stuff so I bought one of the cheaper cameras at $300 and came across this one. It works great! The only problem is that the screen on the back, drains your battey completely but if you  dont use the screen or use it for a really short time, it'll be ok. I was  testing out the camera when I first got it and left the screen on for a few  minutes and it was already getting really low on battery so I had to  replace the batteries in around 15 minutes! Other than that, a great  camera. Its easy to use and the pictures come out good.","After taking thousands of pictures with 340R in a long trip. 340R is reliable. But I found some faults:<br />1. only the high resolutions provide good quality  picutures. Low and Medium resolutions pictures look ok on the monitor but not acceptable when print out using a printer<br />2. This camera  has problem with red eyes reduction. Most of the night picutures result  with red eyes.<br />3. taking pictures become so easy that 8 meg or 16 meg  smart card isn't enough for a day long out door.<br />4. using rechargable  battery.","If you're looking for a digital camera that can not only handle web photos, but also some non-web pictures, the Olympus 340R is a good bet.<br />I did a lot of research, including Amazon customer reviews.  At $400 in early 2000 (everything electronic has is relative to date), it may represent the  best value going.<br />The pictures are great (don't rely on the autoflash  indoors...for indoor shots, set the camera for flash).  The operating  manual could be more user-friendly, but is tolerable.  Once you get the  hang of it, it's a very easy camera to operate.  The built-in shutter  cover, which doubles as the power shutoff is an example of simple  engineering genius.<br />On the downside, you'll read that the 340R is a  \"battery hog,\" and it is.  Rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride  batteries (get 8 + a charger) are a must.  I also recommend the FlashPath  adapter.  It's a great way to transfer your picture files to your computer  and saves on battery usage.<br />Though I LOVE Amazon, the truth is that  you'll be better served if you buy generic versions of these accessories,  rather than the Olympus versions that Amazon sells.<br />Another battery  saving technique is to avoid using the built-in mini-monitor to take  pictures.  You don't need it.<br />Net, for $400, you can't beat this one.","We bought the Olympus D-340R for Christmas.  If this is your first digital camera purchase, as it was for us, you won't be disappointed. Ours came with an 8mb SmartMedia card which is plenty big enough for average picture  taking.  We also purchased the adapter to use at home to save on batteries.  In retrospect, I wish we had purchased the rechargeable batteries instead  and not had to deal with plugging in a cord, but the adapter works well.  I  can't tell the difference between the resolution on super high quality and  high quality.  They are both superb and as good as I've seen on more  expensive cameras.  Download time is reasonable and not a problem.  We  reviewed many other cameras before settling on this one and just couldn't  find anything else that provided this kind of excellent quality for such a  reasonable price.","There's a reason why this camera is the most popular one on the site - it is all you will ever need in a digital camera, at an unbeatable price! I understood ZERO about digital photography and had it up and running in no  time. Make sure you get the following accessories:<br />(1) A floppy adaptor,  because moving pictures to your computer by cable is too slow.<br />(2) A  16MB memory cartridge because you will not be able to stop taking  pictures.<br />(3) Extra rechargeable NiMH batteries and a charger because the  one minor drawback of this baby is the way it eats batteries for  breakfast.<br />I cannot say enough good things about this camera. If you're  just looking for a camera to record your friends, family, and life, this is  the one.","Before I purchased a digital camera I reviewed many.My first choice was I beleive it was a HP 200 or something like that.The price was the same as the Olymbus D-300R.I went and looked at the 300R read the reviews which  were all good.Now that I own one now for three days I can't say enough.This  camera is amazing.Very clear in or outdoors.Easy to hook up to a pc and  TV.The software is great.I am completely satisfied.One minor detail.I have  to get to learn how to preserve the battery life.You can't use the LCD to  much.But what's perfect?At this price I can put up with it. Anyone trying  to decide on a camera for this price,stop here this is the one.<br />Pleased  in NY Long Island AnthonyT4u@cs.com","Believe it or not, I ordered this camera on the Web by \"accident\", but now that I've used it, you couldn't pry it out of my fingers with a crow bar.  I somehow  clicked on \"purchase\" on  a web sight that will go unnamed because three days later a federal express  box arrived at my house. Although I was disturbed at first that I had  somehow ordered something without intending to, I  am not sending this  camera back.  No way!  It is deceptively simple looking, but this masks a  ton of features.  The pictures are superb and very easy to upload to a PC  and send as E-Mail.  I haven't had it long enough to run into a battery  problem,but the reviews here clearly see that as a problem.  I suspect I  will buy the battery recharger someday soon.<br />Join the digital age.  Buy  this camera.  You will not be disappointed.","I have had this camera for about 2 months. I bought a smart media card ( an extra one) and makes the camera great for traveling.  I also bought the flashpath media card for easy downloading which is great. I bought them all  from amazon hassle free shopping.","This is a great little camera. A real bargain at this price. Excellent color and quality pictures. Only drawback is slow serial interface to computer. Buy a Flashpath floppy adapter or a memory card reader to  transfer pictures faster. A good card reader that won't crash your system  is made by SIIG. They call it their USB DigiFilm-Combo Reader. About $79  street price. Also get the MAHA charger and NIMH batteries reviewed  elsewhere on this page.","I recieved an Olympus 340R for Christmas and am completly happy.  It is better than I expected from some of the reviews and they for the most part were generaly positive.  I am still on my first set of batteries and have  taken well over 100 pictures.  I rarely use anything other than the optical  viewfinder and this must result in signifantly longer battery life.  It is  simple and fun to use.  It is a blast to be able to take a marginal shot  and not to suffer the cost of developing a throw-away.  If it turns out to  be good, GREAT. If it turns out bad, so what, you have not lost a thing. I  am satisified with the resolution.  It takes wonderful pictures.  I am just  an average user and clearly not a professional, however, I recognize a  quality image when I see one, and have taken 1000's of pictures with our  Canon AE-1.  If I had it to do over, I would still want the Olympus 340R.","I recieved an Olympus 340R for Christmas and am completly happy.

It took me about 15 minutes to figure out most of the camera's functions.  Only thing I have negative to say about  this camera is that Olympus should have included a ac adapter.","I purchased the Olympus 340-R in the summer of '99 for around $350. So far it has proven to be nothing less than spectacular. The image quality is excellent. Most of my pictures are of friends and families indoors, at  bars, or sometimes outside. Download time seems to be pretty quick. I  purchased Ni-MH rechargable batteries and the battery life has been  excellent. Perhaps the only feature I wished I had was a ZOOM. But for an  entry level camera this one is hard to beat.","Compré esta camara y estoy fascinado, me parece una excelente compra, obtuve la mejor relación beneficio/precio, aunque definivamente le faltan mas funciones en su patalla LCD, la opción de panoramico me parecio  excelente, ayudado obviamente por el software que viene con la camara.  Una  falla que presenta es la falta del estuche (toca comprarlo como accesorio)  el cual es fundamental para proteger la camara.  En lo personal la  recomiendo al que quiera comprarla, estoy seguro que no se arrepentira.","After doing a lot of searching on line I decided to order this camera.Thanks to Amazon's always excellent service the camera arrived just in time for a family trip I had planned.This left me with only a few hours  to learn what to do before using the camera for the first time. Though the  manual has 183 pages it takes about 3 minutes to learn how to do the  basics. Truly impressive. I went on my merry way and shot a whole bunch of  pictures. Upon returning home I installed the included software and  downloaded the pictures. One gripe regarding the software package;it would  be nice to have a \"Lite\" version of the instructions for use for  us novices. I'm sure the help section has an answer to every question, but  all I want to do is the basics and this software has so many features it  gets to be a pain to find answers. I did get it working tho, and am truly  impressed with the quality of the pictures I took. I did not get the power  converter, but am planning to use rechargable batteries so the drain during  downloading is no issue. All in all I find this camera a pleasure to use  for a first time user like me, and I'm sure if you bother to find out all  the features for just about anyone. All in all a great product!","I bought this camera after returning an Agfa esmile.  What a difference $200 makes.  The batteries burned out after downloading 10 photos on the old' camera; with Olympus, I have downloaded over 200 photos and there is no sign of battery drain.  Also, the LCD screen is very handy.  I stronly  recommend this product.  Excellent price to quality value.","The instructions manual is tiny and the font smallish, so first thing was having it enlarged at the friendly Copy Shop.  The language is good English (even the Spanish version is clean) instead of the usual jargon.  Besides items are not overexplained.<br />The camera itself is amazing, but requires  reading the manual.  Then you discover it packs 40+ functions, including  the possibility of formatting the media card.<br />Once you learn how it  works, the results are fabulous.  For the price the only competition is  black magic.  There definitely are no cons, except the very minor gripes  the reviewers have repetaed endlessly.  For myself, I will enjoy like mad.","I have only had this camera for two weeks, but found all the features easy to use.  It's a great little camera if you are taking pictures for web use.  The only drawback is that it takes so long to download to your computer.  I'm not sure if that is true with all digital cameras.  You most certainly  will need an AC adapter. I also find that 8MB is plenty of storage unless  you went on a vacation and were not able to download the pictures, but then  I really wouldn't recommend using this digital camera for important  pictures just quick shots for using on the web media.","Very easy to use, light and compact.  Simple to download pictures to the PC, great resolution for the dollar.  Too bad the D340R doesn't have an optical zoom lens, and the AC adapter is not included (battery drain is  supposedly a problem during picture download, so it is odd that they do NOT  include it--What's the deal Olympus?).  Overall I think this camera is a  good choice if you don't want to spend a fortune.  Given the state of  technology, an expensive digital camera will become obsolete in a few  months anyway, so why pay top dollar?  This camera will do the job for  less.","Without question....buy the camera.  Do what I did and check the reviews.  Amazon's is slightly off mark. Most rank the D340R at the top of the \"Under $300.00\" class.  1280X960 TRUE megapixel resolution is hard to beat at $250.00 (what I paid) and the quality is just what others  have said....1st rate!<br />Unlike Amazon's review, it IS a battery miser,  second only to the HP C30 (1000 photos).  The full motion LCD screen is the  only credible drain and not using it will give you well over 700 shots on a  set of AA's.<br />My camera came with an 8mb card.  Amazon is incorrect in  stating 8megs give you only 60 standard quality photos.  It's 122 640x480  pictures.  If you plan on doing a lot of picture posting or emailing,  640x480 size pictures don't overwhelm the servers out there.  You get 36 HQ  pictures (1280x960)...4x the file size of a standard quality pic.  18 SHQ  pictures (1280x960 but with superb crispness and detail) fit on the card.  What am I saying?  You won't need to buy a spare card if you can hook up to  the computer every few days or weekly at the most.  I'll buy a couple extra  cards for any long road trip!<br />A final comment on downloading.  Serial  cable connections are inherently slower than USB hookups.  However, the  Olympus D-340R's download time through it's serial connection is remarkably  fast...a lot faster than HP's and Fuji's....about 5-7 secs per 640x480 pic.<br />I hope this helps.  This camera truly is fantastic and I've become both  a website buff and amateur photographer as a result.  Happy New Year!","Because of my satisfaction with Olympus 35MM cameras and the ratings of the D-340R on this site, I decided to buy an Olympus D-340R. I am so happy that I made the 340R purchase - the pictures are very good and the camera is small, light, and easy to operate.  This is my first digital camera and  I highly recommend it.  All of the pictures on my home page were made with  the D-340R.","I look on amazon frequently and my annual stop is at my D340 digital camera I got for Christmas. This camera is the best digital for the price. You just need to spend five minutes with it to fall in love like I, and  alot of others did. It is compact and light. The LCD moniter is rather big  for its competetor's. It's battery life is not a significant issue if you  have a common battery charger. I've taken about 300 pictures since i got it  yesterday and still taking them. This thing is the best for fun and  leisure.","I first heard about this camera from my son-in-law (who had saw it at a local department store) in Nov. The next day I went to the store to check it out and was so impressed that I put two of them on hold for Christmas  Gifts (one for him and one for me). An added special was a free 16MB smart  media card was included. I took the instruction booklet from my camera box  and have been reviewing it off and on up until Christmas.I also located  this web site and have been reading/comparing the comments and the more I  read the more convinced I was that I made a good choice. My son-in-law and  I opened our camera on Christmas Eve. and began taking pictures immediately  and it was awesome.  I echo the comments of most of the other owners that  give this OUTSTANDING camera a high rating. P.S. We both received a small  four (4) battery recharger with 4 batteries in it plus the 4 none  rechargeable batteries that came with the camera.","I have had this camera for 2 weeks and WOW! am I totally impressed. I read tons of reviews before I bought this and was hesitant about the menu not being displayed. After working with this for a short while my fears were  put to rest. Easy to use. The battery issue is not even an issue. I have  downloaded my pictures twice now ( 30 or so) and still am using the same  batteries that came with the camera. I will be purchasing a Lexar  SmartMedia card reader within the next week to help the downloads go faster  because I can't wait to see my pictures and send them to family across the  US. Don't hesitate to grab this one, if you can find one!","I have been using the D-340R for 3 months now, and it has performed beautifully.  The pictures are clear and sharp, and the camera menu is intuitive.<br />The only problem that I have with it is that it takes a while  to download the pictures to my computer.  Because it uses a serial  connection, downloading the full 8MB from the camera takes up to 10  minutes.  Some other cameras have parallel or USB connections, but none can  stack up to the quality of the D-340R.","After going through Sony, HP's, and Kodak cameras, this one is definately the best.  People that have problems with battery life are obviously keeping the LCD screen on alot.  If you turn it on to take a picture, review it, then shut it off till you get to the next picture, it will last  for days on hi-capacity Ni-Hi rechargable batteries.  In my opinion, DON'T  buy the AC adapter.  If you are using hi-capacity rechargables, you will  not kill the battery life by downloading pics into your computer.  Once  they are downloaded, turn the camera off.  People make the mistake of  editing their pictures on their computer and the camera is still left on.  Referring to only downloading one picture at  a time - use the software available from the Olympus website.  The software  that comes with the camera is junk.  Their new software gives you more  simplicity and control over what you download into your computer.  In my  opinion, this is the best camera around for the price.  You will not be  dissapointed.","I just want to say that this camera is the greatest buy. I've been trying to wear these rechargeable batteries that come with it down for 12 hours. I get 122 pics on Standard mode. It does 2x photos and 3x viewing. Really  great buy. Totally satisfied. Between the software and the camera, Pictures  are a breeze. And the price is right. Does everything and more than cameras  I've experienced at three times the cost.","I posted a review of this camera a few weeks ago, shortly after purchasing it.  I gave it 4 stars, mainly because the manual wasn't well written.  However, that still being the case, I must say that this camera deserves 5 stars!  It takes amazingly clear, bright pictures.  The video display LCD  is bright.  And it seemed to take forever for the rechargable batteries to  run down! I highly recommend this camera!  If it had an optical zoom, it  would be perfect.  However, with this camera, you get more than you pay for!","So many people have written about the technical part of this wonderful camera. I agree with many of them. You won't feel bad about spending your $$$. I've shopped around and I've made my decison with confidence. (Yes,  you can find this item for less at other e-stores, but I trust Amazon, they  deliver promptly and their Customer Service is great!)  Some customers have  said that this camera eats batteries like crazy. It's only true when you  use the LCD monitor to TAKE pictures. If you use it  for reviewing (and  deleting) the pictures you have taken, it lasts a long, long time. I have  purchased my camera before Thanksgiving. It's December 12, and after taking  hundreds of pictures (most using flash), I am STILL using the batteries it  came with!  Lemme tell ya a little secret, if you do take pictures using  the LCD monitor, and you get the message that the battery is low, turn off  the camera, let it rest for a little while and turn it back on again. The  battery life will show full again! No need to change the batteries until it  tells you it's dead and you have been taking pictures using the viewfinder.  Now, it is not a bad idea to get yourself some rechargeable NiMH batteries.  I've seen many good comments about the brand MAHA. Also, I have seen great  reviews on MAHA's charger model MH-C204F. Some people have mentioned them  here. But I didn't know where to purchase them from. So here you go. For  more info on the MAHA products, go to Maha-comm website. And to purchase  these two products, check out Thomas-distributing's website (sorry I can't  include the exact web addresses according to the reviews guidelines, but it  isn't hard to figure out). For around $50 I got the charger and 8 NiMH  batteries. Now you can go on the road and not worry about your batteries  dying or where to purchase them.  It's a lot of fun to have a digital  camera and take hundreds and hundreds of pictures knowing you don't have to  pay for developement or wait to finally see your pictures. Just download  them and enjoy or use the video cable to see your photos on your TV. Or  just use the LCD monitor! :)  -- From a happy Olympus/Amazon customer. :)","Before I bought this camera, I never took pictures: the marginal cost of taking any given shot was too high, given the film purchase and developing.  With a digital camera, this cost drops to ZERO - I can take all the pictures I want!  In that respect, it's absolutely worth the $ that  you'll spend on the camera, a case, NiMH batteries, and a charger.  Contrary to many reviews, the camera DOES NOT eat batteries too quickly; I  used it heavily for days before the meter showed any drain.  The desirable  missing feature is an optical zoom, but you can't expect one at this price.  (Those of you not living on a college student's budget may want to post  the extra $, though!)  Pictures are amazingly clear and colorful, and  download time is nothing to complain about.  A great deal - GO BUY THIS  CAMERA!","The camera itself works great,the product discription says ok for PC/MAC,but you have to wait until you read page 148 of the manual to find out that it's not setup for an iMac.Be prepared to spend a lot more money  for attachments if your using the iMac.","This is my first digital camera, and I am quite impressed so far. It is reasonably easy to use, and the picture quality is more than adequate for my purposes. Standard quality mode is OK if you don't enlarge the photo too  much, and if you aren't trying to capture fine details or textures. HQ and  SHQ offer significant improvements in image quality. It is annoying that  the AC adapter is not included and must be purchased separately. If you  minimize your use of the LCD display and use a separate device to download  pictures, you can probably get by without the AC adaptor. Overall, I am  very satisfied with the camera so far and am looking forward to taking LOTS  of pictures without having to pay and wait for film and processing.","I just bought this camera based on the reviews here. I cant add much to the reviews above (The image quality and features on this thing are top notch) but I did want to let prospective buyers know that Olympus is now  offering the camera with 4 NiMH batteries and a quick charger included.  Nice to know the company takes consumer feedback seriously!","This is my first digital camera and my very first camera forover $200. Overall, I'm happy with it - it's easy to carry andtakes great pictures.  There's not a pause between pressing the button and the camera actually taking the picture, which is a problem with other digital cameras.  Some things to keep in mind though:<br />1. Downloading from the camera to your computer is EXTREMELY slow through the Serial Cable.  Buy the SMART DISK floppy. Basically, your memory card fits right into the floppy disk, and the floppy disk works just like any floppy.  The only bad thing about the floppy is it takes two lithium batteries.<br />2. If you have a laptop, you probably want to buy the DDSMFLSAD Smart Media Adapter for PCMCIA slot. Does the same thing as the SMART DISK floppy, but obviously cheaper. Same downloading speed.<br />3. If you don't buy 1 or 2, then buy an AC adapter (which by the way, doesn't come with the camera). Your camera must be on to transfer the pictures to your computer. Again, extremely SLOW.<br />4. There isn't a protective covering for the LCD monitor, so buy a camera case. This case doesn't come with the camera. Costs around $20 at any store. Actually you can buy the Olympus 200-523 Accessory Kit which has the AC Adapter, 2 MB card, and camera case.<br />5.  This camera comes with an 8 MB card which holds 36 HQ pictures or 18 SHQ pictures. I can't tell the difference between the two qualities.  8 MB is good enough. After taking about two days worth of pictures, I download them to my computer and erase the 8 MB card. I don't feel the need to have more or larger cards. But then again, if I traveled and didn't have access to my PC, then I would invest in a couple 32 MB card.<br />6. Camera doesn't have zoom. I took some pictures of my friends running a marathon, and it would've been great to have the zoom feature. I sometimes regret not buying the Olympus D-400 Zoom Digital Camera for $600.  If you like taking close-up pictures without being near the object, then don't buy this camera.<br />So in summary, I actually spent an extra $200 bucks ($500 total) to make this purchase worthwhile.","The D340R does a very nice job for the money. It would be nice if the camera had more of a zoom feature, but that's probably its only shortcoming.<br />Best results come with the HQ mode. You can save up to 36  pix on 8MB card in the HQ mode. The SHQ mode provides less JPG compression  and a truer image, but the tradeoff is that you can only save 18 images on  an 8 MB card. I haven't noticed any real improvement with the SHQ mode and  -- in my opinion -- the pictures actually look more pixelated in the SHQ  than in the HQ. The JPG compression of the HQ mode smooths the gradients a  bit more, it seems. So HQ mode it is for me on almost every shot. The LQ  mode is only 640x480, and the image quality deteriorates rapidly if you try  to do any zooming or cropping on LQ pictures.<br />I print my photos on an  Epson Stylus Photo 750 printer. In most cases, the output looks to the eye  to be genuine photo quality. As mentioned above, if you try to do blow up  pictures too much -- especially in LQ mode -- the image quality  deteriorates visibly.<br />Battery life has not been a problem for me, but I  use the LCD display as little as possible. I only use it to review pictures  already taken, not to frame or compose shots. I use the viewfinder to  compose. You get a little more in the picture than what you actually see in  the viewfinder, so it's not likely that you'll cut someone's head off in  the picture.<br />I download pictures using the serial cable (included).  Download is rather slow, and it takes several minutes to dump an entire  full camera's worth into the computer. I haven't figured out if there's a  way to select just a few thumbnails off the camera and not download the  whole set of thumbnails. Once you have the thumnails downloaded, though,  you can select only those you want to download for real.<br />The manual is  straightforward and easily understandible, and all the camera controls make  sense once you're up on them. You probably would have a tough time figuring  them out without consulting the manual, though.<br />I hope this is helpful.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this little camera.","The Olympus D-340R is, in my opinion, the best value digital camera available right now.<br />The picture quality is impressive---I usually can't tell the difference between the pictures it takes and pictures taken  with a $340 SLR that I have scanned in.<br />Also, the camera is fairly  lightweight and compact and easy to use, like a good point and shoot camera  should be.<br />Since I bought my Olympus, I have not taken 1 non-digital  photograph.  I enjoy the simplicity of the camera and the freedom from  developing and film costs (some $10/roll).<br />Overall, the camera is worth  the investment and it is an excellent camera for someone new to digital  photography.","After reading every review we could find, we ventured for the first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R digital camera.  We were definitely not disappointed.<br />After just a few days the  camera accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while  we nervously left our Canon SLR at home.  The camera performed marvelously.  We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our  needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptop.<br />We were  amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings.  We took shots  at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly  the projected image on the screen was readable!  While staying in the  countryside in a traditional Mongolian \"ger\" (tent), we shot an  incredible photo of the predawn sky-- even the morning stars are clearly  distinguishable!<br />Arriving home we were completely satisfied with the  photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our HP  Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper.  I doubt that most people  would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard  developed snapshot.  The enclosed Olympus and Adobe software is easy to use  and functional for most home use.  You will absolutely love the Quickstitch  utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shots!<br />One of the only  weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the  optical viewfinder and the digital one.  If you frame... say, a head and  shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will discover that digitally  the camera sees a much broader area.  Olympus should do a little better job  calibrating the two viewfinders.<br />Apart from that, you will want to invest  in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop around for the best  price.  Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory  card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the flash memory card,  slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into any computer.  You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your  table, plus a significant download time.<br />One last item-- Do you think a  16MB memory card will be too small for your needs?  Olympus, through their  website, is offering an inexpensive upgrade through the end of December  that will allow the camera to use the new 32MB memory cards.","This camera takes outstanding photos-both up close and at a distance! Plus, it comes with its own programs(on CD) which means it saves you money...unlike some of the cameras out there which still require you to buy  more of their items just to view the photos.  I do recommend anyone who  buys this camera to also buy the adapter package, as batteries do NOT last  long if you plan to use the LCD monitor(which I love-because you can see  the WHOLE picture without closing either eye).  Either way, this camera is  well worth the money, and the different ways you can shoot a photo is a  must for the beginner! Easy to use and upload photos.","I've had my Olympus D340-R camera since April of 1999 and I just can't say enough good things about it. I love it. It is the BEST camera that I've ever owned or used. It has so many functions and the software that comes with it is fabulous. You just can't take a bad picture with this camera.  The ONLY downside is that it does use up batteries quite a bit so I've got  an AC adapter for mine for when I use it indoors. Also when the camera malfunctioned (my fault, water got  spilled on it) Olympus fixed it for free under warranty and had it back to  me within two weeks working perfectly again. I have not ever had such a  positive experience in dealing with a company before. Their warranty  service was excellent and their products are even better.","Quite simply... The best bang for your buck. I also love the stitching and 3.0 Adobe Photo editor SW that comes with it. If you want great pictures without spending alot, this D 340-R does it. I've had it for a few months  and use it often with no problems.","I've owned the camera for one week and it has worked very good so far. I agree with the other customers about the manual... it would be a lot better if it had a section for each language, not three languages together in one  page. But the camera is very easy to use, takes excellent pictures and has  many nice features. With a tripod, you can take great pictures at night  without the flash! The software is also very easy to use. Although it's not  documented in the manual, the camera comes with a TWAIN driver, so you can  choose to download the photos with the bundled application or with your  favorite photo editing software.","This camera is worth the money.. I hate the manual with a passion.. Its clear but in different languages.. You have to look harder than you should  have to... Great Pictures, eats batteries that is a true statement...  Transfers easily to computer.. No problems.. Good feel to it and I am very  happy overall....","If it had an optical zoom lens, this camera would be perfect! But, it would also cost a lot more. The  camera is nice and small, fits easily in a coat pocket so you can take it  anywhere. Picture quality is great, a bit soft on landscapes but all  digital cameras are, even the 2 megapixel ones don't really do landscapes  that well. The macro shots from this camera look spectacular, and people  shots are just great. They print out very nicely, too. The autofocus works  very well, and the metering is excellent (you can adjust the exposure up  and down 1 stop if you want, but so far I haven't found it necessary).  Color saturation is great, and very accurate. You can't adjust the white  balance manually, but fortunately the camera's automatic white balancing  works extremely well. You have 4 options when taking pictures, SQ (standard  quality), HQ (high quality), SHQ (super high quality) and SHQ uncompressed.  SQ is 640x480, the rest are 1260x980, the only difference being the  compression used. HQ uses the most compression, and SHQ uncompressed uses  no compression at all (a nice feature that many cameras don't have -for  those really detailed shots). I find HQ works just fine for most pictures,  and I can get 73 of those on a 16MB card. The viewfinder is a bit small,  but not hard to find, and it's quite clear. The LCD is good, even in the  daylight. Controls are easy to learn and well laid out. It's easy to view  your pictures on the LCD, and you can delete any one (or all of them) at  the touch of a button. You can also protect any of them from being  accidentally erased. There's a 3x feature that allows you to see a portion  of the picture a 3 times the size, useful for determining how sharp it  really is, or if you moved the cameral during the shot. The flash works  very well for its size, and you can easily turn it off, set it for fill, or  red-eye reduction. The panorama mode works great, even hand-held. I took  some shots of a church with the steeple way, way up there, using the  panorama feature, and when I assembled the shots later on the computer  (it's an automatic process) the result was tremedous. You could not see the  seams at all, even though I took the shots hand-held. Great stuff. The  camera is pretty sturdy too. I dropped it from about 3 feet and  (thankfully) it survived. The software is reasonably good, and I really  like the little Camedia thumbnail viewer. Downloading from the camera is  smooth, although a bit slow since it's serial. However, the FlashPath  adapter works really nicely and is much, much faster. The camera uses batteries pretty quickly,  but if you get some NIMH rechargeables you'll have no worries. Go to Thomas  Distributors on the web, and buy the MAHA MHC-C204F charger  and  8 NIMH batteries and you'll never run out. With the MAHA you can even recharge them in your car. Don't buy the Olympus NIMH charger, it only works with Olympus batteries (yes I tried it with some others and it  got so hot it almost caught fire) and doesn't have the features of the MAHA  (and it costs quite a bit more).  By the way, the camera comes with a  home version of PhotoDeluxe, which is an OK photo editor. Has the basics.  But you'll probably want something else eventually. I recommend PhotoSuite  II - really great for the price and very easy to use.  Anyway, I guess  I've rambled a bit, but bottom line I'm very happy with this camera. Going  digital is so freeing - you can take as many shots as you want, no film  costs, see exactly what you have before you walk away, and then put it all  into your computer to play with.","I have to say that I'm quite impressed with the quality of the images produced by this camera.  It is easy to use (once you read the manual), and it's a snap to transfer images to your computer via the included serial  cable and software.  I am somewhat disappointed in the manual.  It is  difficult to read and it does't include all the information you might want.  For example, I was disappointed that it apparently had no Twain driver.  But when I browsed the included CD-ROM, I noticed it had a Twain directory.  I clicked Setup, and voila!  I now don't even use the included software; I  use my old friend Paint Shop Pro and the Twain compatible feature that was  not even mentioned in the manual!  One other little glitch I noticed about  my camera -- it does not erase all pictures at once except from the  software.  The manual explains how to erase all using the camera buttons,  but it doesn't work for me.  I have to erase them one at a time, or connect  to the computer and use the software to erase them.  All and all, it's a  great camera for the money -- $300.  Oh yea, and mine even came with the  rechargeable batteries and a charger!","I bought the D-340r for my daughters wedding.Used it at the rehersal. I got a picture of my father with his grandaughter. The picture was worth the 299. I thought the sony was a better camera until I compared picture for  picture. So much for the sony name. I am getting the flash card adapter. I  will enjoy.","To find out what's good about this camera, read the other reviews.  Here are some things that missed the mark.  The manual is a human factors disaster.  The print is tiny, the table of contents is on about page 30, if  you can find it and they used that confounded \"all four languages on  each page\" format instead of four separate sections with black blocks  at the edge to make each section easy to find.  The software had a few  problems.  There was a little utility that appears to be a general camera  interface for Windows.  When I tried to set it up, I found that it listed a  wide variety of cameras but the D-340R wasn't among them!  It also came  with Adobe Photo Delux.  I've heard a lot of raves about this and other  Adobe products.  They were all from people who'd never tried competing  products. In other words, the software will do a lot, but as with the  manual, the human factors are terrible. They don't even follow the  \"Save As\" convention to output different file formats. With  Adobe, you use the old \"export\" convention.  I also found that  some of the JPEG's output by Photo Deluxe could no longer be read by the  other viewing software that comes with the camera.  I recommend you find  people who have other cameras and look at their photo processing software  to find a more user friendly program. Finally, the manual frequently  recommends using the AC adapter for some common operations.  Well, if its  the best way to go, why is does it not come with the camera?  You may as  well buy one when you order the camera.  As for the camera, its fairly easy  to use, but not before you've read the manual which isn't easy to use.  Once you've done that, the pictographs make sense and the frequent user  shouldn't have to consult the manual again.  A little more effort at user  friendliness here would obviate the need for a manual for most  operations.<br />Does all this mean you shouldn't buy the D-340R? No.  If the  hardware turns out to be reliable, its price performance combination is  hard to beat, and the difficulties are all surmountable.  They just make it  an target for the competition.  If you need a good basic digital camera  now.  Buy it.  If you can wait, keep your eyes open for improved products  from all manufacturers.","After TONS of research, I decided on this camera. After reading the reviews, I stocked up on batteries. But once I got this camera 4 weeks ago, I have not had to change the batteries at all!! I found that if you read  the user guide that came with the camera, you can easiley maximize the  battery life of your camera. I would recommend this camera to anyone. This  is a great buy. Get it while it lasts!<br />Casey","Great high quality pics, low price but eats batterys up like crazy!  Overall great buy :)","For only $300, this camera is an excellent choice for anyone who needs to take digital photographs.  It has more features than I ever thought possible, including the ability to slice a picture into 9 sections and zoom  in on each one (on the LCD screen), and hook it up easily to a TV and use  the slide show function to display your photos on a larger  screen.<br />Although the positives outway the negatives, there are still some  aspects I could do without.  I have had the camera for 2 days (and have  been using it very much as well), and already the battery low warning has  appeared.  I read that you should really use the AC adapter for doing  'camera --> PC' transfers, as well as connecting it to your TV.  I  haven't done that, so I'm sure those are 2 main reasons the batteries are  already low.<br />Also, it is suggested that you use the LCD screen for  viewing pictures only, as not only does it eat up battery life but you can  take more steady pictures when using the viewer rather than the  LCD.<br />Camera --> PC transfers are slow and you can get quite impatient  waiting for the included software to index/thumbnail all the pics on the  cam before you can do anything such as download, etc.<br />But, for the price  it's an excellent camera.  You can save in .bmp, .jpg, and .tif using the  included software.  Using the lowest image quality mode, you can store  about 120 on the included 8 megabyte SmartMedia card, and they come out  exceptionally well, too.  4 flash features, zoom, and more make this camera  a necessity for the novice photographer or just about anyone.","This camera resolution is crisp and clear, very easy to use- point and click, light and compact to carry everywhere I go.<br />I use this inexpensive camera to post my photos for my auction. This is better than a scanner.","This camera is to me an excellent option to enter the digital photography universe. Their great quality images, the multiple options to review the pictures taken and the easy way to operate their multiple optiones, make  this camera the best.","I've had the d-340R for a while and I think it is one great camera.  The high resolution pictures come out great everytime.  The LCD viewfinder means a perfect picture everytime.  Battery life isn't great but who cares.  Spend some extra money on batteries, it's worth it","I have only had mine a day and so far I am very impressed with this camera for what it is.  It is not an expensive, loaded camera with lots of bells and whistles.  It is a user friendly camera with just enough features to  make it advanced enough for anyone from a beginner to intermediate digital  camera user completely happy!  I wish that it had come with the AC adapter,  that is my only negative comment.  The software it comes with is easy to  install and understand, transferring pictures from the camera to the PC is  a snap.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy a digital  camera for general use.","This is the best amateur digital camera you can get. It has features of more expensive cameras and the backup of the Olympus brand.  1280 x 960 HQ resolution gives you 36 photos in a 8MB smartmedia card.<br />Compare 299.99  to features in other brands: Fuji, HP, Agfa and Kodak ... the Olympus is a  winner.<br />Hints: - Don't use the LCD to conserve battery life. - Buy the  Flashpath adapter, it's better than using cables and the serial connection  and it will be your best investment. - Buy here in Amazon (24 hr.  shipment). It is backordered everywhere else.","Flexible and powerful: fits in a pocket, can provide high resolution high-quality images. Easy to connect to your PC, better with a SSFD adapter than with the cable. Buy rechargeable batteries or don't use the LCD viewer  too much!","Some of the reviews above refer to a short battery life. Using the LCD Display a lot will definitely cut down on battery life. For most pictures it is not really necessary to use the LCD display.","My D340R is everything Consumer Reports said it would be. The instructions are complete and concise and the included software is very efficient and fast, giving a lot of control for picture size, sharpness,and contrast. The  accompanying connectors permit easy connection to the computer and even  include acord to patch into yourTV. The inexpensive AC adapter saves on  batteries.It works well with rechargeable nickel hydride AA batteries. The  macro feature permits use of the camera in place of a scanner. There are  four flash modes but the flash is  pretty \"wimpy\" after ten feet.  The 2X \"telephoto\" works well but one wants more.<br />All in all  the camera is a delight and well worth the bargain prices that one sees for  it today.","I read all of the reviews, and then bought the 340R.  Works great.  Before the 340R, I would scan photos, and then have to color correct, but with the 340R, the colors look natural right from the camera.  The hi-res photos are  fantastic -- now I need to buy a printer.","I like this camera alot!  The price is excellent for the features and quality.  My only complaint (and it cost Olympus 1 whole star), is the battery life.  This thing verily eats batteries!  If you're using the  flash, you get about 30 shots before the thing starts playing up.  If you  buy this camera, get the re-chargable batteries and the AC adapter.","I agree with all the high praise offered in other reviews. This is a wonderful camera. I got it to take vacation pictures (in fact it didn't ship in time for my departure, so I simply redirected the shipment to catch  up to me enroute; I *love* amazon.com!!!!) and as soon as I got it I  started clicking away.<br />I was a little concerned about the statement in  the product summary that said a set of 4 standard AA batteries would last  only about 60 shots; fortunately this is not consistent with my experience.  I took between 50-100 pictures a day and went through three sets of  batteries in 12 days; that's about 200-300 shots per set of batteries, not  the 60 listed in the product summary.<br />Obviously it would still be better  (both economically and environmentally) to switch to rechargeable batteris  and I've ordered a set, but if you have to use regular batteries don't be  too alarmed by that statement in the product summary. Just be careful to  follow the manual's recommendation and use the A/C adapter when downloading  to the computer or other non-picture-taking activities.<br />I had a few  problems with the pictures coming out too bright or too dim but I found  that by following the hints in the manual (enable/force/disable the flash,  or point and half-click to set the exposure before the actual shot, etc) I  was able to get good results and for the ones that came out too bright or  dim I was able to fix them by adjusting the brightness using the supplied  'CAMEDIA Master' software.<br />To reiterate: Great camera! I'm very glad I  got it.","I have really found this to be on of the best digital cameras. A fter research CNET picked it to be on of the best and i could not agree more. I reccomend it to anyone!","My first digital.  I did a lot of searching and looked at alot of reviews before purchasing.  CNET gives the D-340R its' editors choice award,  I agree.  Great pics, low price, megapixel technology and endlessly useful.  I highly recommend it.  I also recommend getting the 16 MB SmartMedia card,  this will allow you to take 244 pics in the Standard Quality (SQ) mode.","I'm a new grandparent (first time) June 8th and love the closeup option on the D-340R.  It is an exceptional camera for low-light shots.  Turn off the flash, turn on the closup option and 'see' the baby in the digital display  on the back of the camera just like an SLR only better.<br />Then if the baby  closes her eyes or moves the wrong way -- just two clicks and the boo-boo  is gone and you're ready to re-use the memory.","I liked the camera so much, I bought one for my Dad for Father's Day and he loves it! However Amazon's review states that the memory card is only 4 MB for 60 standard resolution shots. My D-340R contains an 8MB smartmedia  card for 122 shots, standard res.","This camera pretty much has it all - it's small, easy to take pictures with, and the software was a snap to install and use.  I've owned digital cameras in the past, but this is a completely different experience.  I'm  using it more often than my 35mm camera!<br />I've never even used the highest  resolution - the 640x480 pictures are incredibly crisp, and I've received  numerous compliments on them.  For the money, this has got to be the best  digital camera you can buy.","I purchased this about 1yr ago and use it a ton.  Have since purchased a lot of other Olympus products to go with it that are not as helpful (printer, etc.) so overspent in the wrong place. I strongly recommend  getting the Olympus 200-547 16MB Smart Media for Digital Camera PCMCIA Card  (Amazon's price on it is better than good - I paid over $100) because it  makes the taking and viewing seemless with your computer - if you can  accept PC Cards, most can.  The Smart Media card allows you to instantly  view images, send via email, post to image hosting sites for auctions, etc.  without using Olympus' rather lousy, but usable, Camedia Software.  All  round its the best choice for the mid-market digcam - I'm happy and expect  you will be too.","I originally chose the D-340R because it listed more features than others in its price class.  Now that I've used it a bit, I'm glad that I chose this as my first digital.<br />Easy to set-up, easy to use and great  resolution! Plenty of memory too!  Great camera."]}]
