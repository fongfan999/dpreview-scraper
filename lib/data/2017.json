[{"name":"Canon EOS 77D / EOS 9000D","amazon_reviews":["Build Quality:<br />So lets get started by first taking a look at the build quality and features of this new camera.<br />Now if you’ve ever used a rebel series camera from Canon, you’ll feel right at home with the 77D. It’s got a great feel to it when you first pick it up in your hands. Compared to the older Canon T6s, which is the predessor to the 77D, not too much has changed in terms of the feel of the camera.<br />And thats a good thing I think. The 77D is right in that sweet spot size for a DSLR.<br />It’s not a small as a micro four thirds camera or a smaller DSLR like the Canon SL1 but it’s also not as heavy as cameras such as the Canon 70d or 80d. Buttons are where you’d expect them and are easy to navigate and the menu dial at the top here has all of the manual and auto settings that you’d expect. So overall the build on the 77d is great and should work well for most users.<br /><br />LCD Screen:<br />Let’s now turn the 77D around and take a look at the rear LCD screen. Now one of my favourite features in DSLR’s over the last few yeas has been the inclusion of touch screens. At first when it’s easy to think that they’re not useful, but the more that Iv’e used them, the more I’ve really come to appreciate them And on the 77d it’s great, especially now with the new dual pixel autofocus.<br />Being able to select what you want in focus is as simple as touching the screen and your object will smoothly and cinematically come into focus.<br />The screen itself is really nice and even in bright daylight is easy to see. One thing I like about the 77d is that you can pretty much use the touch screen to do everything on the camera. I’ve used some other cameras which limit you to just selecting focus with the touch screen and I think that thats a bit of waste, so this is nice to see. Another great feature and one that I wouldn’t want to live without now is the articulating screen on the 77D.<br /><br />Essentially this allows you to flip your screen up and down and to the side, which is great for helping you set up your compostion.<br />It's also great for video aswell especially if you film yourself like I do. Pair that with the dual pixel autofocus and the 77d is a pretty sweet one man band camera.<br /><br />Menus:<br />I just quickly want to talk about the menus on the 77d now too. Now the menus have changed slightly no on the 77d and too be totally hoenst, I’m not exactly sure about how I feel about them. They are a little bit more similified and I can understand the way that Canon were going with this, but I’m not exactly sure if it was needed. I never really had that many problems with the Menus before but at the same time I think having these basic menus will probably be good for beginners. They don't really change the way the camera works overall so it’s not a bad change.<br /><br />Top LCD Screen:<br />Now one of the key differences between the Canon 77D and the Canon T7i or 800d is at the top of the camera here. The 77D includes a top lcd screen which is great for seeing your settings without having to use the back lcd or looking through the viewfinder. Now these are normally found on more expensive professional cameras so i’m glad that they included this on the 77d. I often use the top lcd to quickly check my settings and even though it’s not really going to improve your shooting, it’s definitely a nice touch to have.<br /><br />Dual Pixel AF:<br />Now I’ve been shooting with the Canon 70d for around 2 years now and one of my favorite features in the camera is it’s dual pixel Autofocus system. It’s fantastic.And I was so excited when I saw that the 77d had it as well. And after testing it, i’m happy to say it works great.<br />To me cameras with dual pixel autofocus are by far the best on the market. Not only does autofocus work quickly, it’s also a very smooth and cinematic focus. Theres nearly no hunting as well and face tracking works great. I’m actually using face tracking now.<br />Now some people will still like to use manual focus for video work, and thats ok, but to me, the 77d’s autofocus is great and something I’d be happy using a lot.<br /><br />Competition:<br />Now let’s quickly talk about some of the competitors to the Canon 77d. The Canon T7i or 800d is a similar camera to the 77d and got released at the same time. I’ve had time with both of these cameras and really like them both. They both have great autofocus and features.<br />Overall in terms of image quality theres almost no difference with these cameras but the main difference is really useability. I like having things like the top lcd screen on the 77d and the slightly large grip does feel nice. Another camera you might look at is the Canon T6s which is last years model. I used that camera a lot and loved it. It was a great improvement from the t5i  but I’d probably choose the 77d instead mainly because of the dual pixel autofocus in the new cameras.<br />On the upper end you could be looking at the 70d and 80d which as you know I love. Both of those cameras have the dual pixel autofocus so they’re quite even on that point, but one definite bonus on the 80d is it’s inclusion of a headphone jack.I was a little dissapointed that that was left out of the 77d and i think it should be in here. So if you know you need that, the 80d will be for you. On the nikon side you might be looking at the D5600 or the D7200. Both of those cameras are great, with the D5600 having a tilt screen as well. The D7200 has great autofocus in stills mode and it’ll be interesting to see how it compares to the 77d.<br /><br />Video:<br />Let's now talk about the video on the 77d. Overall I think we’ve seen some great improvements. Useability for video is excellent with the articulating screen being very easy to use with the 77d. Like I said before, being able to use the touch screen to pull focus is brilliant and really is very acurate.<br />The dual pixel autofocus is definitely a big upgrade from the t6s’s hybrid autofocus. It really does work well. I am dissapointed that they left out the headphone jack on the 77d. For budding cinematograhers it would've been a nice inclusion.  Now of course there is no 4k vide in the 77d but I didn’t expect it. Sure it would've been nice to see but for most people, the 1080p footage will be more than enough. So overall this is a great little camera for video production.<br /><br />Burst Mode & AF:<br />So let’s talk about the burst mode on the 77d. The 77d shoots at a 6 frames per second, which for reference sake sounds like this.Now this is a little step up from the t6s and it’s nice to see. 6 frames per second should be fast enough for most day to day shooting.<br />Autofocus is great on the 77d in stills as well. Sure it’s not at the same level as something like the Canon 7d mark 2, but for a sub $1000 camera, it’s definitely impressive. So overall as you can tell I really like this new 77D. I think that this will be one of the most popular cameras for 2017 and beyond and if youre thinking about buying it, i highly recommend it.","Upgraded from a t4i, and its quite the improvement in focusing speed and accuracy on the same set of glass.<br /><br />I've tested it with the EFS 18-135 STM, 24mm STM, EF 50mm (a little noisy for video on this) and all of lenses are operating smoother and faster than the t4i.<br /><br />Being I've owned this for a whooole 3 hours now the initial thoughts and feeling is.. no regrets :) totally a worthwhile upgrade.<br /><br />The body is lighter, so be careful as you may have to adjust tripod weights if you're front heavy (lens doesnt change weight).<br /><br />Things I havent tried yet, but will update subsequently.<br />- Wifi connectivity (in mac os and windows)<br />- Video render / raw view.<br />- learning everything else about the 77d :).<br /><br />Worthwhile if you are coming from at least a t4i or older digital rebel body.","After pre-ordering, Amazon shipped it and got it Friday 3/31. Having previously owned a Rebel T2i, this is definitely a more hefty and having the second on top is nice.<br /><br />And the USM motor is so quiet for videos.

It is way too expensive for what it is. Even compared to its sibling the M5 which has a better LCD screen (M5 has twice the LCD pixels as the M6) and touch focus while using the view finder (M6 doesn't have it while the optional view finder is connected).<br /><br />For video it takes good quality video, but not as good in my view as other cameras that have been out for the last couple of years, like the Sony a6xxx series. It does 1080p60 video max, but for me, that's all I need.<br /><br />The photos are a bit noisey in low light, grainy in fact--again with the kit lens.<br />In good light you get that great Canon color that a lot of people love. You can shoot in RAW and JPEG, which is nice.<br /><br />The camera settings differ based on which option is selected on the dial. So if you're in P (program) mode, you get one set of options, if you have it in Auto mode, you'll see different options. So you can't set things unless you first set the mode to something other than Auto--not a show stopper, but kind of silly, but no where near as complex as Sony's \"interesting\" menus.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have is this is (to me) a $700 camera with the lens, not $1299 (I got mine for $1099 on a one-day unpublicized price cut on Amazon). Why $700? The LCD itself is low res and quite thick and plasticy. It also only flips up, not down--no reason why, just cheap engineering or design specs--not sure.<br /><br />I actually ordered 2 of them, but after using it for a few days, canceled the 2nd one since it isn't as good as I expected.<br /><br />All in all, I would suggest if you can get it on Deal of the Day or on sale, it is a nice little camera. Just not the state-of-the-art it portends to be.<br />I have an M5 on order also because this was going to be video and throw in my bag camera--but it just doesn't have the feature set this long-time DSLR user wants, starting with image quality.

I only have this camera for a few weeks but so far I love it.","Build Quality:<br />So let’s start this review off by taking a look at the build quality of the Canon T7i. Now if you’ve never used a DSLR before the T7i might seem like quite a large camera, but in fact compared to most DSLR’s, it’s actually quite small. Just for comparisons sake I’ve a Canon 70D right here and it really makes the T7i feel very light. And to me thats a great thing. Because the T7i is a little smaller, I think that this means you’ll be more likely to take it out with you and to take more photos. For beginners and intermediates thats a great thing. Now I used the Canon T6i a lot last year and not too much has changed on the body of the T7i.Buttons are exactly where you’d want them to be and easy enough to find.<br />Like i said in my review of the Canon 77D however, I do wish the buttons were a little more pronounced because they are a little flat and hard to find when you’ve got your eye up to the viewfinder. At the top of the camera here you’ll notice that this is a little to the bigger brother the 77D. On the right the camera, we have your main mode dial. Essentailyl this where you can change the different setting that you want to shoot in whether that be automatic or the manual modes. One thing you’ll notice is that in the T7i you’re missing the mode dial lock that we saw on the 77d. This isn’t a huge deal to me but it’s one thing to be careful with so you don’t accidentally change your settings. At the top here we have a dedicated record button which is nice to see as well.<br />So overall the build quality is nice on the T7i. It’s definitely a smaller build than most DSLR’s which could be a big bonus if you like to travel or walk around with a lighter camera.<br /><br />LCD Screen:<br />Let’s turn this camera around now and take a quick look at the rear LCD screen.<br />As with last years model, the T7i has a brilliant rear LCD screen. I think Canon actually make the best LCD screens out of any camera company at the moment. The screen is fully articulating which means you can flip up and down and to the side .<br />This is great for setting your composition because it means you can take photos from up high or down low without having to look through the viewfinder. And if you’re a youtube or a blogger, having the ability to flip the screen completely around is great, because it means you can see yourself while you’re filming, which is what I’m doing right now. A little tip is that if you get one of those cheap $5 remotes off of amazon, you start and stop your recording without ever having to touch the camera.<br /><br />Touch Screen:<br />One thing that I didn’t mention before was that the Rear LCD Screen is also a touch screen. Now this might seem like a big deal but it really does make using the camera a breeze. Rather than having to use the dial on the side here to change your settings, you can simply use your finger to quick change what you want. It’s very similar to using your phone and it’s also very responsive. Sure it might seem like a beginners feature, but I’ve found myself using it a lot to move quickly though the menus. Not only, now that the Canon T7i has it’s new dual pixel autofocus system, you can simply touch on the screen where you want it to focus and it will quickly and cinematically come into to focus. It’s great.<br /><br />Dual Pixel AF:<br />Speaking about Autofocus, lets now talk about that new dual pixel autofocus. This has been a feature in the higher end 70d, 80d and 7D Mark 2 cameras and is one of my favourite features. A few years ago, getting good autofocus in video with a DSLR was un heard of, but now with this new system it works great. So I was reall happy when the t7i included it. So how well does it work?<br />Fantastically. It’s almost flawless. Face tracking works great and if you use the spot focus setting, whatever is in the centre frame will smoothly go into focus. You can even do focus pulls by simply pressing on the screen.<br />I’m actually surprised canon put this in a lower end model and I’ve gotta give them props for that, this is a brilliant inclusion in the t7i.<br /><br />Competitors:<br />So if you’re looking to buy the Canon T7i, theres a good chance you would have look at some other cameras in the same price range.<br />So what are the competitors to the T7i. Well the obvious camera that a lot of people might be looking to buy is the Canon 77D.<br />This was released at the same time as the T7i and it’s a fantastic camera. It’s got the same dual pixel autofocus but also has a few minor differences. Firstly we’ve got this lcd screen on the top. This gives you a little bit more information without having to look through the viewfinder. We’ve also got this scroll wheel on the back. To be honest, these aren’t huge differences between the two and the t7i is a smaller camera, so if you can live without those two features, the t7i will be good for you.<br /><br />You might also be looking at the older T6i. I reviewed this camera a lot last year and it was a great beginners dslr. It doesn't that dual pixel autofocus, instead it has a hybrid autofocus. Personally id recommend getting the t7i instead. On the upper end you could look at the Canon 70D or 80D. I actually use a Canon 70d and love it, and the 80d is a step up again. For beginners to intermediates, the t7i will be more than capable, but if you really want a great camera, go for the 80d.<br /><br />On the nikon side you might looking at the Nikon D3400 or the Nikon D5600. Both of these cameras were released last year and they’re both very nice. The D5600 is the most similar and also has a fully articulating screen. If you’ve never used a nikon dslr before it might take you a little while to get used, but again both of these cameras are quite good although I would still give the advantage to the T7i.<br /><br />Video:<br />Lets talk about video now with the T7i. Normally if people ask me which camera I’d recommend for beginner cinematographers, I’d say something like a Canon T3i or T4i, but these days, I’m going to recommend this camera here. And thats its actually packed with a lot of good video featues.<br />We’ve now got 1080p recording at 60 frames per second, which to be fair was a long time in the making. That means you can get some pretty nice slow motion in post. Sure theres not 4k video recording, but i wouldnt trade for the great dual pixel autofocus in video. Like i said before, it works fantastically. Especialyl for beginerrs who aren't used to manually focusing, essentially now they can just point the camera where they want it and it’ll be in focus. On the side here we have a dedicated microphone input which means you can add a shotgun mic on top, which is something id recommend as well.<br /><br />Again I'm disappointed that that canon haven't included a headphone jack in these cameras, but hopefully its something they'll add next year.<br />We've also got HDR video recording now in the T7i which last year was just in the high end t6s model and I’m really happy to see that we have timelapse mode included now. If you're up an up and coming blogger thats going to be a great feature for you. So overall this is a great little camera for up and coming cinematographers.<br /><br />Burst Mode & AF:<br />So lets quickly talk about the burst mode of the Canon T7i and I'm happy to say it’s had a nice upgrade to 6 frames per second.<br />Thats pretty quick for a camera under $750  and just for reference sake it sounds a bit like this. Pretty impressive. That should be fast enough for most sports and even some wildlife shooting.Autofocus is also much improved and should get you through most situations, although I did find it struggled a little bit in very low lighting conditions.<br /><br />So overall as with the Canon 77d i think the T7i is a real winner. Whereas last year they left out a few options, this i think this camera is the real and a big competitor to the 70d and 80d from canon.","Giving it a 5 star rating but I must admit that this is my first DSLR camera and I'm barely in the first stages of learning how to use it. I picked this particular model because of the easy to use, made for dummies like me, new user interface. I don't know if this is a good choice for a beginner price wise (1200.00), but if you're willing to master it with the Feature Assistant then I think it's ok. I love the picture quality but I'm only comparing it my iPhone 6s. I got this camera with the 18-135mm lense and for me this lense is solid but I only plan to use it for my kids, their birthdays, school plays etc. I don't know if this review helps anyother beginner out there but if you're a newbie like me, you'll love this camera as I think it was made for us.","Best bang for your buck, BUT the RAW file used isn't compatible with Photoshop yet.","Excellent value. Great video.","So far, this is an excellent upgrade from a Rebel T5i. I only have this camera for a few weeks but so far I love it.","Build Quality:<br />So let’s start this review off by taking a look at the build quality of the Canon T7i. Now if you’ve never used a DSLR before the T7i might seem like quite a large camera, but in fact compared to most DSLR’s, it’s actually quite small. Just for comparisons sake I’ve a Canon 70D right here and it really makes the T7i feel very light. And to me thats a great thing. Because the T7i is a little smaller, I think that this means you’ll be more likely to take it out with you and to take more photos. For beginners and intermediates thats a great thing. Now I used the Canon T6i a lot last year and not too much has changed on the body of the T7i.Buttons are exactly where you’d want them to be and easy enough to find.<br />Like i said in my review of the Canon 77D however, I do wish the buttons were a little more pronounced because they are a little flat and hard to find when you’ve got your eye up to the viewfinder. At the top of the camera here you’ll notice that this is a little to the bigger brother the 77D. On the right the camera, we have your main mode dial. Essentailyl this where you can change the different setting that you want to shoot in whether that be automatic or the manual modes. One thing you’ll notice is that in the T7i you’re missing the mode dial lock that we saw on the 77d. This isn’t a huge deal to me but it’s one thing to be careful with so you don’t accidentally change your settings. At the top here we have a dedicated record button which is nice to see as well.<br />So overall the build quality is nice on the T7i. It’s definitely a smaller build than most DSLR’s which could be a big bonus if you like to travel or walk around with a lighter camera.<br /><br />LCD Screen:<br />Let’s turn this camera around now and take a quick look at the rear LCD screen.<br />As with last years model, the T7i has a brilliant rear LCD screen. I think Canon actually make the best LCD screens out of any camera company at the moment. The screen is fully articulating which means you can flip up and down and to the side .<br />This is great for setting your composition because it means you can take photos from up high or down low without having to look through the viewfinder. And if you’re a youtube or a blogger, having the ability to flip the screen completely around is great, because it means you can see yourself while you’re filming, which is what I’m doing right now. A little tip is that if you get one of those cheap $5 remotes off of amazon, you start and stop your recording without ever having to touch the camera.<br /><br />Touch Screen:<br />One thing that I didn’t mention before was that the Rear LCD Screen is also a touch screen. Now this might seem like a big deal but it really does make using the camera a breeze. Rather than having to use the dial on the side here to change your settings, you can simply use your finger to quick change what you want. It’s very similar to using your phone and it’s also very responsive. Sure it might seem like a beginners feature, but I’ve found myself using it a lot to move quickly though the menus. Not only, now that the Canon T7i has it’s new dual pixel autofocus system, you can simply touch on the screen where you want it to focus and it will quickly and cinematically come into to focus. It’s great.<br /><br />Dual Pixel AF:<br />Speaking about Autofocus, lets now talk about that new dual pixel autofocus. This has been a feature in the higher end 70d, 80d and 7D Mark 2 cameras and is one of my favourite features. A few years ago, getting good autofocus in video with a DSLR was un heard of, but now with this new system it works great. So I was reall happy when the t7i included it. So how well does it work?<br />Fantastically. It’s almost flawless. Face tracking works great and if you use the spot focus setting, whatever is in the centre frame will smoothly go into focus. You can even do focus pulls by simply pressing on the screen.<br />I’m actually surprised canon put this in a lower end model and I’ve gotta give them props for that, this is a brilliant inclusion in the t7i.<br /><br />Competitors:<br />So if you’re looking to buy the Canon T7i, theres a good chance you would have look at some other cameras in the same price range.<br />So what are the competitors to the T7i. Well the obvious camera that a lot of people might be looking to buy is the Canon 77D.<br />This was released at the same time as the T7i and it’s a fantastic camera. It’s got the same dual pixel autofocus but also has a few minor differences. Firstly we’ve got this lcd screen on the top. This gives you a little bit more information without having to look through the viewfinder. We’ve also got this scroll wheel on the back. To be honest, these aren’t huge differences between the two and the t7i is a smaller camera, so if you can live without those two features, the t7i will be good for you.<br /><br />You might also be looking at the older T6i. I reviewed this camera a lot last year and it was a great beginners dslr. It doesn't that dual pixel autofocus, instead it has a hybrid autofocus. Personally id recommend getting the t7i instead. On the upper end you could look at the Canon 70D or 80D. I actually use a Canon 70d and love it, and the 80d is a step up again. For beginners to intermediates, the t7i will be more than capable, but if you really want a great camera, go for the 80d.<br /><br />On the nikon side you might looking at the Nikon D3400 or the Nikon D5600. Both of these cameras were released last year and they’re both very nice. The D5600 is the most similar and also has a fully articulating screen. If you’ve never used a nikon dslr before it might take you a little while to get used, but again both of these cameras are quite good although I would still give the advantage to the T7i.<br /><br />Video:<br />Lets talk about video now with the T7i. Normally if people ask me which camera I’d recommend for beginner cinematographers, I’d say something like a Canon T3i or T4i, but these days, I’m going to recommend this camera here. And thats its actually packed with a lot of good video featues.<br />We’ve now got 1080p recording at 60 frames per second, which to be fair was a long time in the making. That means you can get some pretty nice slow motion in post. Sure theres not 4k video recording, but i wouldnt trade for the great dual pixel autofocus in video. Like i said before, it works fantastically. Especialyl for beginerrs who aren't used to manually focusing, essentially now they can just point the camera where they want it and it’ll be in focus. On the side here we have a dedicated microphone input which means you can add a shotgun mic on top, which is something id recommend as well.<br /><br />Again I'm disappointed that that canon haven't included a headphone jack in these cameras, but hopefully its something they'll add next year.<br />We've also got HDR video recording now in the T7i which last year was just in the high end t6s model and I’m really happy to see that we have timelapse mode included now. If you're up an up and coming blogger thats going to be a great feature for you. So overall this is a great little camera for up and coming cinematographers.<br /><br />Burst Mode & AF:<br />So lets quickly talk about the burst mode of the Canon T7i and I'm happy to say it’s had a nice upgrade to 6 frames per second.<br />Thats pretty quick for a camera under $750  and just for reference sake it sounds a bit like this. Pretty impressive. That should be fast enough for most sports and even some wildlife shooting.Autofocus is also much improved and should get you through most situations, although I did find it struggled a little bit in very low lighting conditions.<br /><br />So overall as with the Canon 77d i think the T7i is a real winner. Whereas last year they left out a few options, this i think this camera is the real and a big competitor to the 70d and 80d from canon.","Giving it a 5 star rating but I must admit that this is my first DSLR camera and I'm barely in the first stages of learning how to use it. I picked this particular model because of the easy to use, made for dummies like me, new user interface. I don't know if this is a good choice for a beginner price wise (1200.00), but if you're willing to master it with the Feature Assistant then I think it's ok. I love the picture quality but I'm only comparing it my iPhone 6s. I got this camera with the 18-135mm lense and for me this lense is solid but I only plan to use it for my kids, their birthdays, school plays etc. I don't know if this review helps anyother beginner out there but if you're a newbie like me, you'll love this camera as I think it was made for us.","Best bang for your buck, BUT the RAW file used isn't compatible with Photoshop yet.","Excellent value.

Image quality, looks and handling are far and above my XE2 and X70. It feels like a camera worth thousands more and the image output is nothing short of impressive. Whether you already own several Fuji cameras or this would be your first time trying the X100 series, you simply cannot go wrong with this camera. Presently, IMO, there's no better street/travel camera in the market.<br /><br />Hybrid OVF: I was personally looking into this feature which basically there's an electronic overlay on top of the optical viewfinder so that you can get relevant exposure information; however, I've found framing is not quite aligned with the lens/sensor, often creating super awkward framing since the viewfinder is off to the top and to the side, so you need to mentally calculate the offset. I think it was a good idea on Fuji's part, but they need to improve it -- perhaps aligning the viewfinder right on top of the lens would help.<br /><br />Electronic viewfinder: luckily Fujifilm included the ability to turn the Hybrid OVF into a full fledged EVF with a turn of a switch. The color and exposure accuracy of the EVF is pretty great, but not perfect; however, behaves predictably enough so that you can compensate in your head. Definitely one of the best I've used.<br /><br />Image quality: in short, if in this aspect the camera is 10 out of 5. The colors, the sharpness, the mood, the bokeh, saturation, etc. Absolutely perfect. IMO, this is just as good as it gets. Absolutely exceptional in every test shot I've taken (note, however, as of this writing I have not tested ISO > 1600, so can't speak of noise issues, if any).<br /><br />Look and feel: the camera looks just gorgeous. The \"classic\" camera look just gives it a personality very often absent in digital photography. It handles very well and a breeze to operate (even the small knobs and buttons are easy to get to and work with).<br /><br />Included strap: I honestly don't know why Fujifilm keeps including this strap with all X-series. It wears pretty uncomfortable, cheap materials, sharp sides. etc. At this point I would prefer they didn't include one rather than wasting materials in a strap that will be left in the camera box.<br /><br />Owner's Manual: I can't comprehend why _all_ camera manuals, regardless of brand are just so terrible, and the one included with this camera is no exception. Camera makers need to start investing in much better, user friendly manuals as opposed to a 4x6 booklet with a bunch of information.<br /><br />Lens: there were some Fuji aficionados who were concerned the venerable 23mm/2L lens attached to older X100 series was not going to be able to make use of the new sensor and image processor, I can say confidently those fears were just not granted. One of the main reasons image quality is perfect is because of the lens. It's exceptionally sharp and punchy even wide open. Stopped down to f/4 is simply incredible. The bokeh is just so even and creamy it beats my whole collection of Canon primes I used to own. Truly impressive seeing this level of performance in a \"pancake\" lens.<br /><br />Conclusions: if you're a street or travel photographer you simply will not find a better compact camera in the market right now -- at least not w/o spending thousands and thousand more. Price-value on this camera is simply phenomenal.","The Fuji X100F has exceeded my expectations and I expected it to be wonderful. I updated from my almost 5 year old x100S, which I loved. Here is a list of the improvements that are the most obvious to me. Image quality is even better. I like the multiple customizeable  function buttons (except they removed the ability to switch to video mode by use of a function button). Focus is very fast. Continuous shooting at 8 fps is great.The EVF is fast and clear. The focus preview info in the OVF is really helpful. The various filters in the drive mode are fun. The ISO dial is handy. The focus joystick and additional focus points are great. The ability to charge the battery with a USB connector is very handy. The front control ring with 35/50/70mm digital zoom equivalents are fantastic. I like the placement of the rear controls to the right side. The ability to do some camera functions with my iPhone is a possibility of some use. . However, my X100S Lensmate thumrbest , Gariz Genuine Leather BL-X100BK Camera Metal Half Case and all my X100S batteries will not fit on the X100F due to design changes (These will go to the new owner of my X100S). Just for fun, I also got the Fujifilm INSTAX SHARE SP-2 Smart Phone Printer.<br /><br />Update: 3-15-17 I wish my Canon 5D Mark-iii was designed like the Fuji X100F. It is simply so much easier to shoot with the manual controls of the Fuji vs. the buttons and menus of the Canon. I can set aperture, ISO and shutter speed on the Fuji turned off. I also wish the Canon had a EVF like the Fuji. With the EVF I can see all settings plus the histogram, exposure compensation information, and depth of field so much easier on the Fuji. That said, I still love my Canon.","Excellent day to day camera that will far surpass your expectations!

I still think the Leica Q is the undisputed lord commander of these \"luxury compact cameras\", but the X100F falls first in line behind it, if not almost alongside it.<br /><br />This Fujifilm X100F camera focuses quickly and only hunts occasionally in near darkness, at close distances, when you don't use the focus assist lamp. If focus speed was a concern of yours, stop it. This camera is nearly as fast as the Q to achieve focus and fire. Also, the shutter can be set to COMPLETELY silent mode. It's so quiet that you cant really be sure if you took a photo until you check.<br /><br />The size and weight of the camera is nice. It's tiny, but feels substantial. It's light but not plasticky and cheap at all. The LCD screen is decent and the EVF/OVF combo works as well as can be expected, with only a slight bit of a lag as the \"eye sensor\" detects your eye and activates the heads up display. The startup time is \"ok\" for this camera, if not a little on the fast side. Sometimes the camera seemingly cant decide which mode you want it to be in (viewfinder or LCD), and that may cause you to miss a shot here and there if you're trying to be ultra quick.<br /><br />Briefly on the negatives. Even though photos are insanely sharp and contrasty, especially using the ACROS film simulation, the overall quality is still not up to the Leica Q. Also, the waxy skin jpeg issue continues to plague Fuji cameras when shooting in color, and this model is no different. This issue is particularly alarming when shooting lighter skinned folks at moderate to higher ISO's, but can be remedied slightly by cranking DOWN the in-camera noise reduction to -3 or -4. People have complained about the placement of the \"q\" button. I don't mind it. The \"control ring\" is stupid and clownish. It should simply be a focus ring and becomes one when you shoot in any mode besides jpeg only. In jpeg mode it controls all sorts of things like the built in teleconverter (35,50,70mm choices) or film simulations, and 2 other options I cant recall as I type this. The AEL/AFL button is maybe an 8th of an inch too far to the left of where it should be. The ISO dial is perfectly fine to me, if not downright clever. The front dial, which sits to the right of the camera, is nearly useless for general purposes, even though its nice to scroll through photos with....<br /><br />Bottom line: I enjoy shooting with this camera. It's affordable enough that I don't get paranoid about losing it somehow, like I get with my more expensive gear. If the Leica Q is the King of compact cameras then this is the Queen (sorry Sony, but I hate you) and it deserves the legendary status it is already carving out only days after its release. All hail the Queen...the Fujifilm X100F!!!!!","I am just charmed by this little camera, having come from the X100T. You can find technical feature comparisons all over, but I wanted to focus on the subtle refinements you only notice when you handle the camera.<br /><br />1. The tactile feel of the buttons feels delightful. They're tighter without being too rigid. The especially appreciate the new feel of the shutter button.<br />2. The delay when you push the shutter button is gone now.<br />3. The joystick is a joy for selecting an AF area.<br />4. The information architecture of the the menu system has been revamped, about a decade from the X100T's, which is improved but still stuck in 2004.<br />5. The manual is much better organized as well.<br />6. It finally has the legendary Acros filter! It's magical.<br /><br />To me, the X100F seems like the final chapter in the X100 line, at the peak of perfection—which is always a balance of features and lack of features like weather resistance that were never meant to be part of this line. My hunch is the newer line (perhaps X200?) will mark a significant departure, maybe with a different lens and articulating screen.<br /><br />I attached two JPEGs straight out of camera. For the color photo, I used digital teleconverter at 50mm, in Chromatic Chrome. The B&W photo is in Acros with a weak grain effect.","I sold my XT1 to try out some compacts, so far I've tried out the Ricoh GR, and now the X100F.<br /><br />Pros<br />- The design is reminiscent of the vintage Leica Model 3. I just love the design of the camera in general. The sleek design gives me the confidence to carry the camera around and not look like a tourist with a DSLR.<br />- Compact but has some heft. As much as I like my camera to be super compact and ultra light, I can appreciate the build quality and heft of the camera that adds a lot of its character. It's around the weight of a hardcover book.<br />- Coming from an XT1, I love how fresh everything feels. The upgraded UI and menu, the navigational buttons, the power toggle all feel better than the XT1. The way the buttons feel have been updated.<br />- I love 35mm focal length. I tried the Ricoh GR's 28mm focal length but found its pictures a bit too distorted. I've also used XT1+35mmF2 and found the 50mm focal length to be too limiting for landscapes. The X100F's 35mm focal length is a perfect fit for me.<br />- JPEG's look great. I just love how easy it is to get good looking shots. The images come out looking natural, with great shadows and color.<br />- I'm not much of a black and white shooter but I like Acros so far especially with Red filter. Acros gives you a bright, clean BW image, with nice contrast. It has a very modern feel to it.<br />- It was a bit hard to get used to the pull up ISO dial at first but with more practice I can now adjust ISO and shutter speed on the fly. I like having both settings on the same wheel because I don't have to move my hand to adjust one or the other.<br />- Joystick works great, I didn't use it at first but I find that I'm using the joystick more and more.<br />- Battery life is pretty nice. I used the camera sporadically for a 6 hour romp through NYC and it had around 40% left, enough time to battery life to transfer my images to my iPhone via WiFi.<br />- Fuji JPEG's work very well with VSCO filters. It's like a perfect pairing. Great if you have an instagram account.<br /><br />Cons<br />- One thing which I think they would have put on the camera is a thumb rest. The camera is a bit awkward to hold without a thumbrest, although it's not much of an issue for me. However I'm sure this issue can be easily fixed with third party thumbrests come out, so not a big deal for me.<br />- I find myself moving the joystick unintentionally. The joystick is pretty sensitive and sometimes my hand would graze it, moving the focus point.<br />- Eye sensor is a bit annoying in that your left hand can unintentionally trigger it.<br />- The function button next to the power toggle is too easily triggered when using the exposure compensation dial<br /><br />That said, these cons are mostly just minor issues for me, and the positives far outweigh the negative. Overall, I really enjoy using the X100F so far. This is a camera that I can see taking everywhere traveling and taking pictures. It just feels good to own this camera.<br /><br />Japan trip update: camera has been a dream to use so far. Its discrete enough that you dont come across as a tourist with a huge Canon. The photos come out simply beautiful. Battery life - I've used the camera on and off the past two days and it only used one tick of the battery. Zero annoyances with the camera so far and I meant it."]},{"name":"Fujifilm X-T20","amazon_reviews":["I was looking to change mi old Xt1, and just I need to say that xt20 have all that you need from new Fuji cameras and also big (56)and small (23 f2) lenses look really good in this small body. And all that for less than $1000.","Exceptional camera, my wife loves it, lots of functions and takes very good pictures. I ordered when it was out of stock and the seller let me know inmediatelly when it became available. Fast shipping. No hustle.","This is an incredible camera that was made for shooters just like myself. I did extensive research about the mirrorless system I wanted to switch over to from my Nikon DX system, and I had identified the X-T2 as my dream camera, initially. I was pleasantly surprised with the release of the X-T20 (and its price tag) this January. It has everything about the X-T2 I coveted (+ touch screen focusing!) and none of the professional video features I didn't need and would never use as a strictly stills shooter. The video is still great, however, and I may now even be more inclined to use that feature. I would have liked the weather-sealing, but just opted for 3-year accident protection instead and feel just fine about that.<br /><br />The body itself is about the same size as my LUMIX LX100 (another really great camera on its own + value-wise) and has the same manual control dials that I love with the perfect amount of resistance. I enjoy shooting film and I think the X-T systems really capture the way it feels to shoot with a film DSLR in a compact mirrorless, down to the sound of the mechanical shutter. I especially love using the focus ring of the kit lens as an aperture dial and the endless button customization options. I've set mine up to be as close in function to my LX100 as possible, so my learning curve was short and it instantly felt familiar. USB charging: life-changing.<br /><br />I love the \"film\" settings and literally just discovered a setting one can use to take double exposure *in camera*, which is one of my favorite film tricks. The menu is mostly intuitive, but there were some options that felt a little hidden or tricky to find, such as the \"shoot without lens\" feature.<br /><br />As a woman with very small hands, this camera still feels tiny when I hold it. I've ordered a thumb grip to make casually one-handing it a little bit more comfortable. However, I love the compactness, and am an avid traveler who hates to be weighed down by my heavier Nikon gear. I feel like I could throw this camera, a wide angle, and a portrait lens into a backpack for a hiking trip and be fine, something I never would have considered with my current system.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera to beginner and pro still-shooters alike. If you are a film fan and want to feel as enthusiastic about your digital camera, the X-T20 will capture that magic. If you're tired of lugging around a DSLR and its bigger lenses, consider the image quality of this sensor (and Fuji's incredible line of glass). Even if you are none of these things, give this camera a closer look.<br /><br />The only thing I found disappointing was Amazon's shipping of the camera. I opened a giant box to find the camera box just free floating, with a single piece of brown paper (see photo). I cringe to think about it banging around in there, and I am keeping my fingers crossed that the rough ride didn't damage any of the internal elements. I was really shocked, as I basically order my life from Amazon and have never had concerns about packaging before.","Most of a X-T2 at about half the price.  I had mine converted to infrared.  Nice companion to my X-T2 and X Pro-2.","Best camera I have ever owned in over 50 years.  Better than my film Leica, m4 & CL.","Overall it is great camera for its price, but be careful with screen, as It did cracked very easy for me. Handle with care in hard case.","Great camera. Great photos!","Quick summary:<br />Pros<br />1. Great value for what it can do ($899 Vs $1599 of X-t2). Same image quality. Same focus system.<br />2. Touch screen focus. To me this is even easier and faster than x-t2's joystick.<br />3. 4K video. My Canon M5 can't do this.<br />4. Amazing image quality and incredibly fast AF.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Not weather sealed. This is a big one and it bothers me a lot. I almost chose xt2 over xt20 because of this reason. However, my favorite Fuji lens 10-24 f4 is also not weather sealed.<br />2. Build quality. It's not terrible. But you compare it to xt2 side by side you'd notice that the buttons feel nicer on xt2. Relatively speaking xt20 feels more plasticky. Even my Canon M5 feels better built.<br />3. Xt20 is made in China while the xt2 is made in Japan. It doesn't necessarily mean one is more reliable than the other but I was caught by surprise when I saw the label. Not a big deal. My iphone is also made in china.<br />4. Almost no grip at all. It is very uncomfortable to hold the camera. I pretty much have to shoot what I need to shoot and then let it dangle around my neck. Can't really hold it for too long. Xt2 feels much better because of its thicker body and bigger grip.<br /><br />So I have 3 mirrorless cameras in front of me: Canon M5, Fuji xt2, Fuji xt20. Each one has things I like and dislike. M5 is a keeper because it gives me access to my Canon glass. I have to choose between xt2 and xt20. The reason I want two mirrorless is because I don't like switching lenses. It used to be hard to shoot with two dslr because of the size and weight. Now even with two mirrorless cameras I won't look like a warzone photojournalist.<br /><br />I initially leaned toward choosing the xt20 mainly because of the price. I take a step back and look at the whole fuji lens lineup I feel safer choosing xt2. Any lens that's larger than the kit 18-55 or prime lenses will be too large for the xt20. It just won't balance well. The Fuji 100-400 caught my eye and I may potentially want it some point down the road. And that lens absolutely will fit xt2 better.<br /><br />The xt20 is still a great value camera. Although it's not suitable for my needs, I can see many people benefiting from choosing this over the xt2. I'm keeping 4 star rating because of the slightly inferior build quality and lack of weather sealing.","This is a question to ask around rather than a review.<br />I received this model on Monday and only tried out twice so far. The auto-focus acts much faster than the X-T1 I used to have, especially within the normal lighting. However the auto-focus has difficult time when I tried close up shooting (Macro mode in X-T1) with the XF 35mm F2 lens. I have to use the manual focus by adjusting the ring of the lens.  I found there is an issue when review the photos I took. Not sure if this is just normal, or this is something to do with touch screen or the color displacement. Here I would like to ask around among your reviewers - appreciate your advice if you happen to know what the issue is - please take a look at those pictures taken by iphone - which are the review pictures shown on the X-T20 touch screen.<br />The first one is the whole screen (LCD) review for a photo I took in backyard.<br />The 2nd one is another review layout with those shooting information - the photo is zoomed as a thumbnail, shown at the upper left corner of the LCD.<br />Now probably you've already seen the issue - there are two highlights shown as black dots/areas appearing in the sky part of the photo - and they are actually blinking.<br />The 3rd one is the enlarged version of those blinking black areas.<br />I wonder what makes this kinda of annoying blinking? It's found if the photos taken by the camera include any color at both ends of the dynamic range - either very bright (white) or extreme dark (black), this highlighted blinking will appear. Not sure if this is something to do with the user setting though most of the settings I did stays with the default, or this is something to do with the resolution of the touch screen, or it's a product defection?<br /><br />Further editing: It's not a product defection. I played for a while and realized it's the issue of my user setting - the dynamic range I set is 100 which is a bit low when I took some photos which include those high contrast subjects, such as the bright sky in the photo. When it got displayed, the parts exceeding the color range will blink with missing or non-display pixels I guess... After I set the dynamic range to a higher value, such as 400, then the display turns out to be OK. It actually became a good way for you to know some of the flaws, such as over exposure areas in your photos.","Excellent and Awesome Results for Fuji XT20 and Amazon make it very pro and delivered as per Standards.","I was looking to change mi old Xt1, and just I need to say that xt20 have all that you need from new Fuji cameras and also big (56)and small (23 f2) lenses look really good in this small body.

I recently shot a wedding with it, while my wife shot with a t5.  The experience was a new one for me.  I have shot with all the typical \"pro level\" DSLR's, the best lenses, etc etc.  Things felt too complicated.  I wanted to get back to reality, it's about the story, not the gear.  Maybe that 5dMk4 will give you slightly better low light, or that 1dxMk2 will give a higher burst rate.  But, for the cost this thing is incredible.<br /><br />Build Quality:  It's nice.  Some plastic, but in the right places.  Nice metal edge.  It feels solid, but not too heavy that it feels unbalanced.  I would say fuji struck a perfect balance with this one.  The latches feel good, the buttons feel good, the shutter button and rear screen are fast, with minimal to no delay.<br /><br />Processor:  Fast, shooting raw+jpg can take a little while for files to buffer, even with a nice fast card.  I've seen worse, but you won't be shooting a nascar race with this thing.<br /><br />Image Quality: BLOWN A.W.A.Y. good.  I wasn't expecting what came out of this little camera to be so freakin good.  Fuji has just this magic with their JPG's that others only dream about.  The new xtrans processor has excellent low light performance, and images look super clean.  I shot quite a few 6400+ and it was completely usable.  I'd say it beats my 6d, and that's known for low light cleans on it's JPG's.  Detail is superb.  I shot with the slightly better 17-55 2.8-4 \"kit\" and it was better than a d610 with a 85mm 1.8 attached (I know, I didn't believe it till I saw it either.<br /><br />Touch Screen:  I didn't think I'd care about a touch screen, but touch focusing  on a point on the fly is an incredible experience, and one that I don't know if I could give up now.  Why do ALL cameras not have this feature?  I found myself naturally clicking my target, and shoot. It's so fast, and intuitive I very rarely missed a shot.<br /><br />Pros: Fast<br />Small<br />Light<br />Powerful<br />Exceptional IQ and Low Light<br />JPG'S are incredible<br /><br />CONS: Battery could be SLIGHTLY better (I got around 450 per battery)<br />The screen would sometimes lag between live view, and the viewfinder.<br />A couple weird bugs with the image on the screen appearing with what looked like a filter, when no filter was chosen (it didn't shoot with a filter, it just looked this way till I changed shooting modes.<br />The viewfinder is a little small.  The rear screen is so good I didn't use the viewfinder hardly at all.  It didn't lag shooting anyway.<br /><br />OVERALL:  If you're in the market for a small, interchangeable lens camera, this one is incredible.  I was debating returning it at first, but after this wedding shoot I'm hooked.  I only have one lens, and it's a stock.  But the files coming from this thing just are too good.  You will NOT look like a \"pro\" photographer at a wedding using one of these, but just let your images speak for themselves.  I love how I can be discrete, and this thing would be wonderful for street photography.<br /><br />TLDR:  BUY IT!","More than anything else, this camera has an excellent amount of pixels for me to shoot street photography with and then recompose a bit if need be whenever there may have been action I didn't have enough time to frame properly. Gives me more time to worry about exposure and working with the amazing film simulations.<br /><br />One con is that it doesn't have an ISO dial, the fastest tool you're going to get is programming one of your function buttons, or dive into the Q menu.<br /><br />I don't shoot for money, I shoot for fun. This takes incredible pictures, and I haven't found its limits yet, clearly. Get this camera if you want the image quality of Fuji's flagships for a significant price reduction.","This is one of the best modern camera. It has beautiful design, convienient controls and outsanding quality of picture. I love it.","Upgraded from Fuji XT 10. This is very much a step up. Great focus, touch screen is a nice plus. Ergonomics much better than the XT10. Overall this camera is worth every $$. Picture quality is amazing. Sharp and awesome colors. I definitely recommend this camera!","Great camera, rivals any DSLR I have ever used. Only down side so far to it is that the hand grip for my right hand has no room. Basically I am constantly hitting the buttons with the thumb part of my palm while trying to take pictures. This brings up a sync option for what I think is the flash. It's happened a lot while getting ready to take a photo using the EFV. Eventually I will learn to pay more attention to where my palm is at in relation to the camera and I think that issue will die down a lot. This camera is just remarkable though.","*I Bought my camera from B&H because amazon was still out of stock*<br /><br />I am loving this camera so far, compact, packed with features, a quality feeling body, and amazing IQ paired with Fujifilm's amazing lenses!<br /><br />~Will do a more in-depth when I'm finished with writing it~","Purchased this at my local camera store (though Amazon shipped theirs 2 weeks ahead of my store!).<br /><br />I purchased this camera instead of getting an SLR. Here's a few reasons why, and the things I love about it:<br /><br />1. Form factor. I've taken the XT20 out for several hours with the base neck strap and, though somewhat noticeable, it's been much less stress on my body than when I've rented SLRs for equivalent amounts of time.<br />2. Buttons/knobs/menus: This is the big reason I would bring the camera down to a 4.5 out of 5 stars (but Amazon won't let me so grade inflation it is). Many of the buttons/knobs are customizable and thus can work with your camera flow. However, if you shoot all manual, some become fully archaic (the front wheel, the exposure dial). Hopefully Fuji wises up and lets them be changed, as there aren't dedicated ISO buttons currently. The FN button, as noted before, is fully programmable but not apparent to the touch- you have to go by muscle memory on where it is.<br />3. Fuji's world-renowed color right out of the camera. I like to shoot RAW if I get the time to edit, but honestly the JPEGs out of the camera look amazing in all lights thus far.<br />4. Great nighttime, high ISO shooting. No grain or artifacting that I've noticed.<br />5. Powerful - This is not the mirrorless cameras of the early-to-late 2000s. this has almost all the features of the more powerful (and twice as expensive) XT2 or XPro2 in the Fuji line, at a fraction of the cost, and with almost the same image quality. If there's a photography style you're looking at online, this can do it.<br />6. High resolution shooting at good quality = high quality print outs, for us curmudgeons who still like those things.<br />7. Great video quality - Supports up to 4K video.<br /><br />Here are some things you might want to consider before you buy this camera:<br />1. Form factor. If you have massive hands, quite simply you may just not be comfortable using or holding this camera. If so, I would consider the XPro 2 with a hand grip.<br />2. If you shoot all auto, you might find this camera overwhelming and too advanced for your needs. If this is you, but you just want something a little nicer than your Big Box Crappy Point&Shoot (TM), you might want to look at something like the Sony RX100 (currently at the Mark 5). It's a point and shoot, so no interchangeable lenses, but more advanced and with better image quality than other P&S, without the overwhelming features and menus of a camera like this.<br />3. Your needs and cost. The kit lens included in this is honestly a great lens, but the desire to buy many lenses will keep up if you shoot long enough; every lens has its strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Overall summary: This camera is great, it is exceedingly powerful for such a small and relatively affordable body, and you won't regret it if you know what you're getting into.","I had XT2 last year and sold it.  I had issues with Autofocus.  Now I decided to try XT20.  I am happier with AF now.<br />Main difference (at least Today before any future firmwares of XT2).<br />Fuji XT2 (and all previous Fuji cameras) could not have Face Detection and Phase Detect Autofocus at the same time.  If you select Face Detect, you go back to Contrast AF.  And if you select CH (Continuous High Speed) on Fuji XT2, you lose  Face Detection.  So its either Face Detection or Phase Detect, you pick what you want.  Forget about tracking by face in Continuous High.  You could only use Face Detection with Continuous Low (CL) on XT2.<br /><br />Enter XT20.  On XT20, it finally works!!!!!  You can select CH, CAF, and voila, you can select Face Detection on or off!!!!!  So you can finally thave Face Detection and Continuous Autofocus at 8fps!!!!!  This is a first on a Fuji.  Of course on any Sony like A6XXX you could always track by face and have PDAF at high speed for the last couple years.  But Fuji had not been able to achieve that feature until XT20.<br /><br />Thus today March 4, 2017, when I am writing this review, Fuji XT20, a cheaper camera, has more advanced AF than XT2, a camera that costs twice as much.<br /><br />Of course XT2 still have 14fps mode and it has better buffer, true.<br /><br />Also Face Detection finally arrived on a Fuji.  You cannot compare it to FD on XT2 and XT1.  It is miles ahead.  XT20 detects faces very quickly, including in lower light.  In fact XT20 Face Detect is as good as Sony or Olympus.  Of course it is not as good as Panasonic, but nothing is, Panasonic FD is just insane, you can have face up/down, left/right, with glasses,with beards, etc, and instantly finds it, but that's Panasonic.  However, in my opinion, XT20 is miles ahead of XT2 in face recognition period.<br /><br />Finally battery life.  Another surprise.  I put a third party 1800 MAH battery in my XT20.  I shot 900 shots before it died.  I repeat, 900 shots.  All in High Performance Mode which I had on from the beginning.  I have not yet tried the OEM battery which is 1250 MAH, but I am going to try it next to see how long it would last.","This is a first impressions review, as weather has allowed limited shooting since getting my X-T20 on release day. (Purchased at my local camera shop where I'd pre-ordered it.) I bought it as a kit with the XF 18-55 lens.<br /><br />I decided that the extra features on the X-T2 weren't important enough to my uses to justify paying the much higher price, especially considering I have to also buy lenses.<br /><br />For context: I'm a casual hobbyist. I've been using the Panasonic FZ1000 and I think it's a great bridge camera. But it does have limitations so I decided it was time to return to an ILC to get the benefits of a larger sensor and better lens. My last ILC was my 1980 Minolta film SLR, so it's been a while! Also, I'm primarily a JPEG shooter.<br /><br />When I started researching cameras I was immediately attracted to Fujifilm because of the physical controls, especially the aperture rings on the lenses. My biggest frustration with digital photography has been the dependence on menus, and Fuji gets you as close to the physical feel of a film camera as possible.<br /><br />There is still some dependence on menus or scrolling through selections with a wheel in the X-T20, but so far I'm very happy with the spartan physical layout. The Q button brings up the quick menu to make frequent changes as easy as possible and the Q menu is customizable. The other buttons and wheels are customizable to at least some extent as well, and that's very important to me.<br /><br />After my bulky bridge camera with a really good grip the X-T20 takes some getting used to. It's so small! That's a huge part of its appeal, but it requires adjustment. The \"grip\" on the front is barely there, and the same goes for the thumb ledge on the back.<br /><br />I had a little difficulty at first because of this. I kept pressing part of my hand against the 4-way selector buttons and my grip was just plain awkward and at an odd angle. The solution for me was to change technique and use my left hand to do all the supporting and my right hand to steady, which feels backwards at first but didn't take long to adapt to. With a larger/heavier lens than the 18-55 it probably becomes necessary.<br /><br />So far everything works pretty much as expected. Many say Fuji cameras have a steeper learning curve for those new to the brand, but Fuji seems to design for the way I think and I've been picking everything up quite rapidly.<br /><br />I don't have a camera on my ancient phone, so shooting with a touch screen is a totally new experience and I've been getting a kick out of it. You can use the touch screen to change focus point, just focus, or focus and shoot. There is a little symbol in the upper right corner you can touch to toggle between those modes, or turn the touch screen off. The touch screen isn't active for menus.<br /><br />I'm a viewfinder shooter so won't use the touch screen a lot, but it's very cool to have. It's especially useful for candid and street type photography because you can flip out the screen, hold the camera down by your waist, and pretend you're fiddling with something so people don't know you're shooting.<br /><br />The dials for shutter speed and exposure compensation are quite a bit stiffer than I expected. They aren't easy to spin with the edge of a finger while using the viewfinder, you need to get more of a grip. But with reversing the roles of my hands in holding the camera that's easier to do. Evidently the dials were too easy to turn on earlier models causing unwanted/unnoticed settings changes, so the stiffness is to prevent annoying accidents.<br /><br />The one real drawback so far is the Fn button on the top near the shutter release. It's small and slightly recessed, so difficult to use by feel. I won't assign anything to it unless really needed.<br /><br />One of my big reasons for getting a new camera was wanting better low light performance, and with my limited shooting the X-T20 is exceeding my expectations so far.<br /><br />Between the excellent IS in the lens and great noise handling I was able to get some nicely sharp hand-held shots well after sunset. At high ISO settings the noise is a fine grain and rather pretty as noise goes. Very high ISO is actually useable as long as you don't get crop happy or print enlargements.<br /><br />I'm quite pleased with my choice. The XF 18-55 lens feels so very right on the X-T20 body, and the combo feels so very right to shoot with. I expect years of enjoyment with this camera because it's just plain fun to use and that's what it's all about.<br /><br />I think the X-T20 is a great choice for those ready to move up from a bridge camera, casual hobbyists like me who can't justify breaking the bank, or those who want a second smaller body for travel, hiking, etc.","Amazing little camera, the image quality is spectacular, if you have big hands it will take some adjustment getting used to the smallness of the camera and the controls. The EVF is not as high quality as the X-T2, and I had to adjust mine to remove a green tint, otherwise for the price of this camera with the 18-55mm f2.8-4 lens is the deal of the year.","[[VIDEOID:7f44451d23c3718294568ff57937004c]] I made an in-depth review of this camera, which I uploaded to YouTube, then decided to upload here since you're not allowed to post links, for anyone who is interested in using it for filmmaking, or is just interested in what it's capable of :)"]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix XP120","amazon_reviews":[]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DC-GX850 (Lumix DC-GX800 / Lumix DC-GF9)","amazon_reviews":["I bought this right when it came out and have been using it everyday.

It also has some pretty impressive abilities for such a small body, and the kit lens consistently produced sharp pictures.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a couple of gotchas.<br /><br />Number one, and the reason why I'm returning it, is that it exhibits what I believe is shutter shock with the Panasonic 45-150 lens, which is what I was intending to use it with. Pictures randomly have strange image tearing at the very bottom of the screen, along with a ghost image that is invisible on the camera lcd but becomes obvious once you look at the picture on a computer. That did not happen with the kit lens, but I also wanted to use the body with a longer zoom lens as well, so that pretty much sank the ship right there. If I wanted a short zoom length only, I would have bought a fixed zoom premium compact.<br /><br />Number two, it has some odd behaviors, such as not allowing flash and limiting the maximum shutter speed in when in monochrome mode. When in iA mode, the flash functions again and the maximum shutter open time is extended. Why? It stands to reason that someone might want to take a monochrome flash picture, OR put he camera on a steady surface and have a longer exposure than 1 second in B&W. I don't understand these strange interrelationships between modes and functionalities. While Panasonic isn't the only camera manufacturer who does that, I do think that disabling the flash should be reserved for \"silent\" mode or deliberate deactivation, not enforced by default when one uses a different mode.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see what other reviewers have to say about the camera. I very much wanted to love it - it is brilliantly designed from a physical interface standard, and very attractive, and takes good pictures with the bundled kit lens. Unfortunately the images with the zoom lens were totally unpredictable - great one moment, blurry the next, even at a higher electronic shutter speed and with IS on.

It's terrible and cheap.","Incredible camera....telescope really gets you up close for razor sharp pictures......this is my second one......have one at each house...love this cam....","Just received the new Fz80 yesterday and took it out today for a trail run. Did very well it takes excellent pictures has good focus speed especially for the price has a very nice zoom range is comfortable to hold, body seems solid zoom is quick it will be a good addition to my other cameras. Took it out to a couple of ponds today for bird and duck photos and got some nice shots It is easy to use has a host of great features which include the ability to take 4K videos and photos excellent entry level bridge camera :)","I been using a Panasonic FZ70 Lumix digital camera for at over 3 years now & it still works, but not as good as before & I pre-ordered this Panasonic [FZ80] a few months ago & recently received it. It takes the same battery as the FZ70 does. It has the same CMOS sensor & lens set up as the FZ70 & has 60X optical zoom also. There are a few [2] more megapixels & a few minor internal tweaks, including some sort of update to their Venus processor compared to the prior FZ70 model. These minor changes internally according to Panasonic is suppose to create slightly better images. Photo qualities so far with this camera seems pretty good & on par with the prior model, FZ70 camera. Daytime outdoor photos are quite good, but in lower light conditions, the pictures are very grainy...as expected. Indoor photos with the flash are great. Video qualities seems pretty good with this camera also...indoors or out. This camera has full manual controls, self timer, burst photo modes, uses SD/SDHC cards & comes with a battery & charger. I would get an extra external battery charger & several extra batteries for this camera. Battery life seems about the same with the prior FZ70....maybe 300 photos with no flash and about 100 photos using mostly flash...not bad. The lens hood from the FZ70 fits this camera too. This camera  looks similar to the FZ70 with some minor exterior cosmetic changes, but the optical and LED viewfinders both are upgraded which are much better than the view finders on the FZ70.  Plus, the rear viewfinder is touch screen type, something the FZ70 did not have & that viewfinder is still in the camera & cannot swivel or tilt at all. Wifi connection possible with this digital camera & the wifi options is in the camera's menu. This camera can take 4K videos & photos. You can also turn that feature off easily. As with the FZ70 camera, you can use an external flash on this camera too. Really, this camera's upgrade over the FZ70 mostly is 4K video/photo, using OLED viewfinders, touch screen rear OLED viewfinder, 2 more megapixels, wifi compatible, a bit more cleaner cosmetically speaking & slightly upgraded internal Venus processor. Menu layout on this new camera is as easy to navigate same as prior Panasonic digital cameras. Really a decent digital camera, but still can take a good photo or video. A modest upgrade from the older Panasonic FZ70 Lumix & can probably give the Nikon P-600 or Canon's SX-60-HS cameras both a run for their money now.","Exelent","I was able to take amazing photos with it which was kind of a surprise as some reviews were so negative.<br /><br />I found it to be of high quality according to price, video is pretty amazing and works great while zooming.","I think this is a perfect camera for those looking to experiment with some more detailed photography than the smaller point and click cameras can offer. (While also staying within an affordable price range.)  I have only tested a few pictures out, because I just received it, but I already love it.  I tested the zoom, and it's amazing how far it can go.  The 1st picture I have attached was standing in my garage with no zoom, the 2nd picture is zoomed all the way in, capturing the flowers in front of the house across the street.  I am definitely impressed with the zoom, and look forward to experimenting further with this camera.  For just testing pictures, I think the quality is amazing already, once I really learn all of the controls I think this camera has some major potential.  I would definitely recommend this camera.","This camera is AMAZING!!! I cannot say enough about it, honestly. Let's start with the camera quality itself. It looks and feels incredibly expensive... hard to believe a camera this nice is so affordable. It has a nice weight and is sturdy in your hands. The design makes it easy and comfortable to hold. It has a viewfinder as well as a digital display, making it versatile. Next, its functionality. The zoom capability is UNBELIEVABLE. I could zoom in to see freckles on my dad's face from across a parking lot, and I am not exaggerating. The picture quality is professional-level. I have yet to try the HD video feature but I look forward to it- I have no doubt it will be as exceptional as the rest of the features. Finally, the cost. This camera was not that much more expensive than most small point and shoot cameras, but the quality of both the camera itself and the pictures it takes is exponentially higher than its less expensive counterparts. I am truly shocked that an amateur like myself can afford to own such an excellent camera, and furthermore be capable of operating such a camera without any expertise. I highly recommend this camera.","I love it!! Beautiful pictures and a lot of options!!!!","Love it! Great all around camera!","Came as expected and on time.  Condition was as listed in the description. Very happy with product and company!","I like it. Takes great pictures. Still learning how to use it. But so far so good ! Arrived quickly and in great condition!","Purchased this for an introduction to digital photography, allot features at a great price and youtube has a few video tutorials to help you learn its features.","This seems like an extremely well made and well thought out camera. I expect to almost always use it on the Intelligent Automatic setting and am mostly impressed with the way that the camera deals with difficult areas of contrast in the picture. I am also impressed with the ability to zoom all the way in on something in good light and still be able to get an acceptable photo without bracing myself or using a tripod. Obviously, bracing or use of a tripod would be better. But this is the test that all my friends wanted to try on the camera and everybody was impressed.","good","[[VIDEOID:2885c729d3605d36c1fee9c8ee26b753]] I've had this camera for a little more than a year and use it constantly with very good results for Facebook images. I typically use the autofocus to make the shots and reduce the default circa 5K JPEG images to about a third of the original size for posting.  I've had worse luck posting video, mostly because of a very slow Internet connection that makes uploading video of any size too time-consuming to be worth the effort. From time to time I use the very fiddly so-called manual focus with a tripod for pictures of flowers, etc., with varying results.<br /><br />You get unbelievable value for the price, but still you are getting what you pay for--20-1200 mm zoom, RAW images (requiring a ton  of post-processing and correction for vignetting, etc.), sort of HQ video (very useful for documentary purposes, but not for filmmaking),  surprisingly good macro capabilities (focus at 1 cm), and decent color rendition.  I like my colors a bit oversaturated, and use the Happy setting for most shots (sorry professionals).  De gustibus etc.<br /><br />The 1200 mm equivalent zoom is not terribly useful unless you have a reason to photograph large objects covertly from a distance in broad daylight. It hasn't helped me at all with birds on the Potomac and I reckon that for most subjects you wouldn't want to use more than half of that zoom in good, bright daylight. Still the lens is very flexible and gives you a terrific choice of FOV for everyday subjects.<br /><br />The aperture is only five point something at full zoom--not the greatest--and the tiny sensor yields a softer focus across the board that you might expect--softer and noisier, IMHO, than some cellphone and pocket cameras of comparable size. Low-light performance is pretty bad, but the camera is far from useless in low light.<br /><br />On the other hand, the 20mm wide angle is very useful both for interior shots and for photographing buildings. Add this to the surprising  macro capability and you get two very strong points in favor of this outfit.<br /><br />There is a new and upgraded version of this camera, the DC-FZ80, which adds 4k video of TBD quality, focus stacking, two more megapixels on the sensor, (I think) an external microphone, and a few other substantial improvements.  Same old lens. Apparently no longer has in-camera memory (??). The early reviews suggest that the image quality is still a bit sub-par from a pro point of view, but the circa $400 purchase price definitely makes the new model a bargain, though not nearly as much of a bargain as this model.<br /><br />There are a number of in-camera special effects filters, some of which are fun--though the effects are easily equaled or surpassed in Photoshop or The Gimp.<br /><br />I probably won't upgrade, but would definitely consider the FZ80 as opposed to the FZ70  if I were moving today from a pocket-model point-and-shoot or a lens-limited cell phone.  The additional functionality might not justify the upgrade, but would definitely enhance a first-time purchase.<br /><br />This old model is still a hands-down, amazing bargain as long as you know what you are getting.  If you are on a budget and are looking for a good learner-type advanced camera, you might well consider snapping up the FZ70 while it is still available.  I've had more fun with mine than a barrel of monkeys and it shows no signs of wearing out.<br /><br />NB--the attached snapshots have all been slightly post-processed in an antique version of PhotoShop and reduced in size for Web publishing.  I include a raw video snippet from the Women's March.  Relata refero--judge not lest ye be etc.","I had the very first model in the FZ series, the FZ1, so I knew how amazing that one was for that time period, so when I needed a camera to cover the Trinidad & Tobago Carnival that would work trouble free and create amazing pics, I knew that FZ70 was going to do the trick. Going with my Canon dslr would have been bulky as I would have  to be switching from the short lens to the longer lens constantly, man with this FZ70 was easier than pie, I can take a pic of an entire truck from 10 feet away and then zoom in to take a facial shot of a model from 100 feet away. You can see the carnival pics from this camera on my site bryanmax.com","This camera is amazing! Haven't tried ALL the functions, yet; but what I have tried so far is truly breathtaking. The one photo that I took of the Moon really took me by surprise; the clarity! WOW! Shipping came on time. Very satisfied.","This is an amazing camera with an incredible zoom. I use this daily for interior home photos, as it has an excellent wide angle lens allowing for most of the room to be captured and is also great for taking sports photos AND video. This is the best camera I've ever owned. Attached is just a sample of the zoom capability.","Great Camera. I have had another Lumix for 5 years. It tool great pictures but we needed more zoom power for wildlife shots. This one is great. I have not found one thing that I don't like. Great price and a super camera. I like to use auto settings for most things but occasionally will do a specialty shot. Camera is great for both but have to admit that I have not used 10% of the features yet.","Love the zoom great product for the $$$","I love this camera.It works beautifully in all settings and takes great shots.The only bad thing is im still waiting for the picture storage card,its going on three weeks and it hasnt even shipped yet.Cant they make a card to work with the camera?Whats the story on this,getting very impatient about this.","I thought that I would treat myself to a \"real camera,\" after my tax refund came in. This camera has more features, and a far better optical zoom factor, than my Samsung Galaxy 7, but the phone has much better picture quality.<br />When I zoom in on a photo taken with this camera, I see a lot of noise, in comparison to the same photo taken with my pocket computer.<br />If you want to hold a camera, buy this. If, however, you just want to take good photos from a tripod, buy a smartphone/tripod adapter and use your phone. It will be far more cost-efficient.","The camera is of high quality and relatively easy<br />to use. The lens are fantastic! I have been able to use the<br />LCD viewfinder for some fantastic shots... To summarize,<br />this is a very high quality product.","Good camera","I'm a Realtor and this is the best non-DSLR camera on the market. Most specs you read on this camera focus on the extremely long range. But, its other end of the spectrum is what I bought it for. It gets to a wider angle than pretty much any non-DSLR. It's great quality photos. Does a fairly good job with lighting. It is a great camera for a Realtor.","It truly will reach out and touch something!! I will say that I agree with the other posters that it does not compare to a good quality DSLR but the zoom is incredible.... which is why I purchased it. For the money it is hard to beat the zoom capabilities that my 1300.00 DSLR just doesnt have.... The digital zoom on this camera goes to 300x!!!! The first is a close up of the moon.... the next is the International Space Station .... the third is a picture of Venus!!!","The price to performance is unbeatable here this camera my not do well in low light, doesn't have the best menu system, or even let you change lenses BUT comparing a 1080p video from this camera next to my Lumix G7 both shot in AVCHD in good lighting conditions the only way I could tell the difference is looking at meta data and knowing the sensors give a different crop affect. To be completely honest this camera is a steal for $250 get one while they still have them!!","I am a  doctor  who  love  to  get  pictures. I a m  very  happy  about  this  camera, look nice  and  is  very compact and I hope I can  get  good pics.  I  plan  to  use  this  in my  next vacation  In  Cuba,  I  going to let  you  know about  the  quality later  this  year.","This is a wonderful camera. It has a built in memory , You don't have to use a memory card. The macro feature is outstanding. The zoom is great. It can take a 30 min video. For $ 249 it is a good deal. I am glad I purchased it.","Love this camera.  I tried to wait until they had a Wi-Fi enabled version but glad I got this one.  It really is light enough to carry all day.","I bought this camera thinking it would be better than the same camera but model FZ60. I loved my FZ60!! the bad thing was it just quit working after 2 years and I have no idea how to get it repaired. This newer model with the extra zoom is very hard to use unless you have a tripod. It does not take shots well with motion and the zoom is very difficult to use for amateurs like myself. I did not see the FZ60 on here for sale anymore but I would buy it again. I am just trying to sell this model to someone in my family and I will purchase something else. I did read the reviews and most people liked it. I also think it does not focus well and takes a long time to make clear when zooming.","I love this great camera.","Great point and shoot camera.","100% Happy with transaction and Camera","I have had this camera for about two years now.  Like most folks I pretty much used the Intelligent mode, which lets the camera set the aperture, ios, and shutter speed to get the best photographs.  It works very well, too.  However when I would try to blow up the images, they would look a little bit pixelated.  That was my fault.  Eventually I learned how to put it in the program mode, which locks the ios at 100 (if that is what you select).  Since then it has produced even better photographs with higher resolutions.<br /><br />In low light conditions, you can do pretty well hand holding it by hand as long as you haven't zoomed out.  But if you do zoom out, it is pretty much a requirement to use a tripod, because the lens extends so far, it is hard to hold it steady.<br /><br />The 60 zoom is terrific.  I can easily photograph the moon on a dark night and clearly see its face.  You can zoom out to 120 with the electronic zoom, but I found a lot of pixel activity, so I don't use it.  Recently I drop the camera (clumsy) and the color reproduction has been off.  So I plan to get another Panasonic as a replacement.<br /><br />Here are some of the photographs that I've taken with this camera.  Houston night skyline, women observing sundown in Tahiti, and the beach on the island of Moorea (across from Tahiti).  Water so clear you can actually see the individual grains of sand 3 feet below the water's surface.","My go-to birding camera! Even captured great close-ups of alligators across the water!","This camera has an incredible zoom on it. What you get in zoom you lose in clarity though. I have two little Lumix cameras and they both take much better action shots than this one. For still shots this does great. This does not do well in low light. I also bought another bundle for my son for their wedding. They said they love it. For the price and for someone that is just looking for something cheap with a good zoom this a great deal. This does have some fun features like you can turn the setting to do different effects as you are taking the picture.","I love this camera.  Since it's no longer made and you`re able to find one at this price, buy it!","I love this camera!  Great photos and easy to use.  Plenty of options is you want to get fancy, but great automatic shots for most of us.","bought the camera because of the 20-1200 mm lens, really impressive. What I did not know, was, the minium aperture is only 8 throughout the focal length. This makes it impossible to use longer shutter speed in broad daylight (even lowering the ISO to the minimum of 100 does not help).","no expensive and amazing<br /><br />very good pictures<br />good quality<br />the zoom is amazing<br /><br />buy it! it's my advice","I love the zoom on this camera. Took some amazing shots of the moon during an eclipse.","For a non-changeable lensed camera - the quality is great.","I'm no photographer and wanted something between a point and shoot but with good range and a DSLR without spending the money on the latter.<br />It does what I want, I can take pictures of nature and landscapes, and also a strong enough zoom for decent moon shots if I can keep steady enough. The only \"downside\" I guess is no remote shutter, but I knew that before purchasing. Good camera for photos and videos on a budget for people not looking for anything too expensive but better than a pocket sized point and shoot.","Great buy.","Awsome","Great pictures and easy to use.","Pros: Excellent all around point and shoot camera. Build quality is good, picture quality is good with a few caveats, and the images can be exported as RAW files. Zoom is impressive. Auto focus is good while all around including while zoomed. Camera is responsive and is available for shooting quickly. Battery life is better than average for point and shoots, even when using the zoom extensively. I have not tried using the video function so I cannot comment on that feature.<br /><br />Cons: The preview screen is lower quality than the point and shoot I was replacing (Canon Powershot sx280 HX). Additionally I noticed that the FZ72 under performed against the sx280 in certain low light settings. I am not sure what is causing this difference, however I do notice a graininess to some of the low light shots.<br /><br />Overall: great point and shoot camera with many features catering to serious photographers and digital editors. There may be better options available then when I purchased this camera, however. Casual users may be intimidated by list of features and functions, and may be dissatisfied with the performance in low light settings using the Auto preset.","My wife chose this camera and likes it. It does what she wants and the price was very good. Some of the newer cameras in it's class have it bested by a small margin but at considerably more cost.","Better than my Canon SLR","Item as described and works well.","Did alot of research on what to buy. Figured out I wanted the ability to adjust settings but didnt want to have to read a book to use EVERY time. Its a great combo and takes fantastic photos.  For the price..you cannot go wrong. The zoom....is amazing.","Overall nice camera, works well.","Great camera for the price!","I waited awhile to review my Lumix because I wanted to spend some time with it. I want to preface that I am not a professional nor am I aspiring to be a professional photographer. I will say that I am an artist so I know how to frame a photo and I know lighting and color. I am also obsessed with wildlife and macro photography which is the reason that I chose this camera.<br /><br />I will tell you that I have had this camera for over a year and have taken pictures indoors in lowlight (with and without flash) sunlight, artificial light, etc... and has given me beautiful photos every time. My last camera, Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150, couldn't handle any of my photography in lowlights.<br /><br />The zoom is wonderful for outdoor photography. The colors are crisp. If you flip it onto auto it will do most everything for you.<br />Lumix DMC-FZ70 is no muss, no fuss. It is wonderful point and shoot for those are new to the photography world and would like a starter camera.","It was purchased for a gift but I saw a close up picture of an Owls head taken by the same model camera. It is definitely easier to handle than the super telephoto lenses for DSLR's.","Used for heavy real estate photography. Amazing wife angle without fish bowl effect. Handles backlight issues and great without flash. Great camera for the price-blows away past two canond","Great camera. I ended up returning it because it was too bulky for me and it turned out it didn't have Wifi, which I didn't realize. Otherwise it was great.","Zoom is great, not comfortable with the other features compared to the Canon.  Takes me too long to switch from auto to manual without losing what I want to capture. Probably just a matter of using it more often. Also the camera is a little larger and heavier than I like.","Everything works fine except there is no wireless remote capability.","Included memory chip does not work. The camera is great!","Amazing zoom range! Good enough image quality, only real negative is it is poor is low light....","Nice camera for a good price. Still practicing with it!","love this camara","I just bought this again when my last one took a swim in the river. I like to go birding and the Audobon people keep telling me, \"You can't take a clear picture of bird this far away.\"  Oh yes I can. And it will have every little bit of fluff in perfect detail. No other camera we've looked at matches the zoom.","I bought this camera for a \"Bucket List\" trip to Yellowstone and the surrounding areas. I took over 1500 pix of landscapes and animals. This camera always came on and focused very quick. I took photos of 4 wolves close to 3/4 mile away. You can tell they're wolves. I have a slight shaking in my hands and the fz 70 even took Most of that out. INCREDIBLE SHOTS. Moving at 70mph. Low light. Long shots. Battery lasted over 500 shots. Close ups on flowers. The only glitch is when you're wanting to take a longer shot and the camera focuses on something closer, electric lines, leaves, etc. I usually could step one way or the other and problem solved.","This is an awesome camera. You can either set it on auto for ease or switch to manual if you want to test out your picture taking skills. I bought  additional lenses and filters and all have worked well with this camera.","Versatile, nice size and battery lasts forever.","Love this camera, even with it's aperture limitations, had another but wore out it's motor.","Ordered when my 2nd FZ200 finally bit the dust...I thought I would try a different model.  Some things are slightly different but overall, the same quality I have come to love from Panasonic.  I do think there is a bit of a difference in the lens (Lumix vs Leica) but not enough to matter to most folks.  Love the extra zoom...just use a tripod or be very steady.  I am still learning how this particular camera works but in no time it will be an extension of my arm just as the previous ones were.","I love photography!  I bought this camera based on MUCH research, including the opinions of Amazon buyers.  So far, very pleased.  While I highly suspect it does not do everything a DSLR with expensive lenses and accessories can do.  However...<br /><br />Update:  After owning this camera for over a year.  Love it more and more.  Like some other reviews here... I too was tired of lugging around a heavy bag of camera gear.  While this camera will not meet the high level needs of the MOST demanding photographers and situations... it creates excellent photographs.  Is relatively light, convenient, versatile.  Probably exactly what 99% want from a camera.  Can get clear shots when using tripod on maximum zoom, macros and everything in between.  The attached shot of the moon here was with NO tripod.  amazing.<br /><br />I read the many learned reviews/opinions from others on Amazon and their valuable insights.  Many are much more sophisticated photographer than me, which helped me select accessories for this camera and gain other valuable hands on tips.<br /><br />I don't yet do any photo editing on the computer.  Suspect that will take my photos to the next level.  It is amazing to me, the amount of relatively simple enhancing today's cameras will do themselves.  This one included. Lots of capabilities.<br /><br />For the price, I and my girlfriend... who bought same item... could not be more pleased.  Is giving us a lifetime of fun and lasting memories.","Bought for my wife and she loves it. Photography isn't my thing so I'm going off my wife's approval of this camera. She says it's the best camera she's ever had.","Bought for a trip to Europe.  Was easy to use and came back with great pictures.","Love it!  Gift for my daughter and she couldn't be happier!","Best bang for your buck.  A really great camera for the price !  Buy it if you can.","Got this camera for my vacation to Disney world. For the price of the camera it takes really nice photos. I have nothing bad to say about this camrea.","I've owned this camera for nearly 3 years and have taken it on several trips an have taken thousands of amazing photos. I absolutely love this camera. I've experimented with many of the manual settings but have found the automatic settings produce nearly perfect shots every time. The panoramic setting works flawless every time.","Just returned from a 17-day vacation in Scandinavia, for which I purchased this new camera.  It takes excellent photographs, and the 60x optical zoom is amazing.  What is particularly surprising, and useful, is its ability to take great photos in dim light, without using the built-in flash; this was especially helpful in certain museum locations where flash was forbidden. It autofocuses very quickly as well. Sighting of the subject can be done by using the LCD screen (which is quite bright, even in bright sunlight) or, with the push of a button, through the small sighting slot just below the flash.  The flash, incidentally, must be manually raised and lowered for use, but this is quite easy and quickly done.","I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this camera. It's so amazing. It makes me look like I know what I'm doing, because it has so many automatic settings. Incredible zoom. Fantastic macro shots. Special settings for every type of scene. Eventually, I'll learn how to use the manual settings. The camera is compact and light-weight. I carried it for a week while hiking and was able to take amazing scenery shots and immediately switch to macro mode to get a picture of a spider web, all without having to stop and switch lenses (or carry those extra lenses with me.) I love, love this camera!<br />(I took this picture of the blood moon on the automatic setting, hand-held.)","Perfect for Soccer games - can get good shots of the kids from across the field.","Great camera. Very please with the pictures.","This was a gift for my husband and he loves it.  It is a real step up from his former camera and he finds it so easy to use as well as able to do so many things he couldn't do with his last camera!","I needed a camera with a 60x zoom that was reasonably priced.  The picture quality is excellent.  The 1080p HD video gives the impression that you are there, enjoying the adventure.","great camera for sporting events and outdoor photography in the light, Hauling around a big lensed DLSR id just not practical most of the time so this gets good shots quickly with ease of carry. The battery lasts surprisingly a long time although I don't use the rear display that often which usually uses a lot of battery. All in all it takes pretty good long shots and is good for sporting shots when I select the sport scene mode the scene modes work well.","Very good","Love this camera.","Already have the ZS40 but find it a bit small for my gorilla hands.  The 70 is absolutely perfect.  Getting rid of all my Nikon DSLR gear, two bodies, five lenses and many pounds in the bag.  Hardly know the FZ is hanging from my neck.  Don't think I am giving up much picture quality for the savings in weight and inconvenience of dragging around all that stuff.","The pictures are not as clear as I wish them to be. The zoom is nice, but the picture quality is lacking.","Love it","Like the superzoom.  Always carry a light tripod. Picture great.","this is a great one i took a let of great pic ..it work great thank you Rod","Camera works great. A lot of different options to try out. The 60x zoom is fantastic. I just used it the the first time last week in CO. I saw something on my walk about 500 yards away. Couldnt make it out with the naked eye so i zoomed in on it and it was a coyote clear as day. I do recommend a tripod for long range snaps. Hard to hold steady. Overall its a great product","nice camera, a little complicated has a lot of features.","I love this camera, i took it with me on my european trip and it worked great.","Still figuring out all the options","I have owned 2 previous models of the Panasonic DMC-FZ line of super--zoom cameras (very early models of this lune) prior to purchasing a Canon camera 4-5 years ago - a decision that I regretted as soon as the newness wore off.<br /><br />Not only does Panasonic offer the best optical zoom & anti-shake combination on the market (IMO) but,  with this model in particular, not only are all the menu options quickly available \"on the fly\" but it has far more options available to it than any other camera in its price range.<br /><br />The biggest reason for my continued use of these camera over a DSLR is that I can go from a 20mm wide angle up to a 1,200mm telephoto shot (not including the digital doom which,  should you activate both levels,  will give you the equivalent of 300-500x zoom although the picture quality begins to suffer dramatically) without not only having to spend hundreds of dollars for each additional lense that you have to purchase but then you have the bother of having to keep track of which lens is stored where in your camera bag and then having to constantly swap them out if, for example,  you want to take a wide angle shot of the Grand Canyon & then want to zoom in onto a bald eagle soaring in the distance.<br /><br />With this camera you can do both in the time it takes the guy with the DSLR to unzip his camera bag & that bald eagle will be long gone well before he ever got the chance to swap his camera lens...","I bought this camera to upgrade and take pictures of products for my blog. The different settings for zoom really help in getting detailed photos and it's fairly easy to learn having never worked with a camera like this before. Visit my blog at christinaschiccorner.com to read my more detailed review I posted about it in my Behind the Scenes: Blogging Tools post where I explained my journey switching to this and how it's helped me.","I am not a professional photographer but normally I prefer DSLR cameras because I find the quality is better than point and shoots. We needed a camera for our honeymoon in a few months and having a camera with interchangeable lenses didn't seem practical while out and about through Europe, so we bought this camera. I have absolutely zero regrets. This camera is incredible. Although it's *only* 16MP, the image quality is far better than the 20MP camera we tried before it. The autofocus is fast and functional. The zoom is amazing. I have yet to try and take a picture of the moon yet but I have taken pictures of other things from a far distance and the clarity of the image, even at 60x zoom, is pretty darn clear. The image stabilizer is a blessing. I have 9 cats and of course when I received this item, I immediately started trying it out on them. As with most animals/children, they never stay still. That was no problem for this camera. It captured and processed the image to the point where it was just as clear of a picture of them moving than if they were staying still. Some other features that I really appreciate are:<br />1. The build. It fits nice in the hands and has comfortable grips. The camera is also surprisingly light but feels well made.<br />2. The video recording looks professional. Video has no grain/noise and stays smooth through motions.<br />3. Auto mode. Set this thing to auto and it will give you amazing pictures. I don't normally like auto because it seems cheap in other cameras but this camera is quite intuitive and the auto mode really does produce great quality images.<br />4. You can attach filters to the lens<br />5. You can attach an external mic or flash to this camera unlike other point and shoots, which is great if you want to use this for more professional purposes.<br /><br />Final words: You simply cannot go wrong with this camera for the price. There are far more expensive cameras out there that are worse quality and have less features. Buy this camera and you won't regret it :]","Whoa, Fred, did you not just purchase a Canon SX 530 with a 50x zoom a few months ago? Why would you trade it in and order this instead? Well, a minor detail is that this is 60x zoom so I gain a bit on the wide angle end but, again that is minor. I had a Lumix travel camera before (for serious stuff my \"big boy\" cameras are Olympus and Lumix mirrorless interchangeable lens models) and I used that camera until I wore the paint off the controls. When it came time to replace it, the Canon was being closed out and was a super deal. Now this one is at a great price and the major thing that drove the purchase is realizing how much I missed the viewfinder which this has and the Canon does not. Only a biggie when taking pix outside in the bright sun and this being Florida...","I purchased this camera on sale from Best Buy. It's the best digital camera I have ever owned. The lens is not removable but it's good enough that I don't have a need to use anything else.<br /><br />I shoot photos of items I'm selling in eBay and of wildlife. The wildlife come at night in low light. Still, through a picture window in my living room that could use a cleaning, lit by two yard spotlights, I do pretty well. I'm still learning all the features. I plan on looking at filters and lens hoods next. The battery life is really long too, which surprised me. Make sure to buy a SDXC card with a high speed. I recently upgraded from a Sandisk 64GB SDXC 30mb/sec to a Sandisk 64GB SDXC 90mb/sec. I didn't expect it to save and transfer as fast as it did. Quite a difference.<br /><br />See a few attached photos I took with this camera.","Great Camera.  Lots of bells and whistles but can be set to automatic.  Will take sometime to figure it all out.  Pics are sharp and color is good.","Loving my panasonic! I really needed the eye piece which the comparable cameras didnt have. Still getting use to the many settings but great so far.","A++ Bought it because a couple of friends had it. Takes great pictures, and has lots of options and a good flash.","The photos and zoom are amazing, especially for the price! My colleagues who specialize in photography are amazed by the quality of our photos.","I am really enjoying using this camera with the 60x zoom.  Some photos, when zoomed to the max, are not crisp when handheld but most are pretty good.  When at a \"reasonable\" zoom they are good.  The only thing I don't like is the online manual.  I'm not printing out 200+ pages and I like to read and experiment which I find hard to do online.","Love this camera. Works well like the branded and expensive ones. This is totally worth buying!","Awesome camera!  It is a bit on the larger size but totally worth it.  I haven't done much with it other than the point and shoot, and used the amazing zoom.  I've shown a few friends the camera and thought it was a much more expensive camera.","I've owned 2 of these camera's on the 2nd one now. For photography folks who love the vast range on the lens 60X, it's truly amazing. I can go from macro, wide shots to moon shots. The quality for low light is pretty good tho a lens of this magnitude, goes to say you loose some on picture quality, but still very good. I had a problem with the first camera the flash never worked. I don't use flash often, mostly aperture modes, but hey, you want it to work when you need it. The presets are great. I use scenery mode, hand held, rapid shoot but now mostly use aperture the most.<br />The flash worked fine on my second camera but I have found that on both cameras after owning for about 6 mo, I have this error message that is related to my memory card but I've replaced card twice so not sure what is wrong and don't think it's card related but the camera. ... I have to turn it off and then back on to get it to work thru it. ... needless to say problem when you are taking quick shots and losing light. This happens most on A aperture mode or using creative mode. Some problems with focus going in and out using A mode. ..not sure if I've just gotten lemons but over all I do love this camera, very easy to use and experiment with, light weight.<br />Pics up low light very well, love the scene mode for sunsets, but now I mostly use A mode. I've included some examples.","Easy to use and just perfect for my needs. Takes wonderfully clear, crisp interior room photos with excellent color. Very, very pleased.","Met all my expectations!  An improvement over my previous  Lumix, only exception is the lens is not Leica, but the images are sharp an clear even at maximum zoom.","Bought this for my daughter to take to camp for her photography skill. A great product that can be added to. She is still raving about it and using it every day. I think we have a photographer in the making.","Great camera, good price","Purchased to take on vacation to the Dominican Republic.  Amazed at the clarity and the the zoom feature.  This 60x zoom really brings far off things very close and even holding it without a tripod I had no problem taking clear photos with the anti-shake feature.  Love that the lens is threaded to accept filters and additional lenses.  Also I love that it it has a viewfinder and hot shoe.  At this price point you don't get all that from other makes.","Great camera. Lots of options for different situations. Takes great pictures and the zoom is incredible.","this camera is terrific.  you can just leave it on automatic settings, and snap away.  it does all the work of choosing aperture and speed, and focuses too.  even adjusts for any small shakes of your hand.  panoramic feature is pretty cool too.  or you can do all sorts of things manually if you choose.  it does videos quite simply too, even in low light.  the card holds a great number of pictures, and the battery lasts a long time between charges.  it does take a bit to familiarize yourself with all of the options, but you don't really have to if you choose to let the camera do the work.  comes with a long and detailed (online) manual that is reasonably clear.  the software is also fairly straightforward, to load into a laptop device.  not as tiny as some - will not fit in your pocket.","Bought this as a replacement for my old Lumix that met the pointy end of a boulder at the beach. Wowser, took it on a test run and am very happy with the improvements. Downloaded user manual from Panasonic site. Still figuring out some of the bells and whistles.","I am a professional photographer and I love collecting camera's and lenses ( about $ 40k) invested in to it).  So I was eager to receive my recent order of a Panasonic Lumix FZ70 - but to be blown away by its performance and quality - who would have believed you could get the equivalent of a $1000 DSLR for less that [$]?My main purpose in ordering this camera was to have a digital camera that was light, easily portable and (most importantly) had a viewfinder. I have severe presbyopia and would be constantly taking off and putting on a pair of reading glasses to see the screen of my Samsung which was usually visually obscured by the ambient light of everyday outdoor shooting. This camera solves that problem as I hoped it would...but I discovered it could do so much more. I couldn't have imagined it possessed so many extraordinary features normally associated with only the most expensive DSLRs. Hand-held night photography? Check. Extreme macros? Check. In camera special effects? Check. And a zoom that has to be experienced to be believed (Check my photo in middle). Focus on a distant feature that literally can barely be seen from your current position and then slowly zoom out until you discover that it is so far away that in the full wide position of the zoom it has disappeared completely! Even has a \"hidden\" ability to make time-lapse video in the MINIATURE setting. Take pictures in reduced sizes for social media use or go full-blast RAW for Photoshop lovers. Be sure to download the full users manual PDF file for a course in this cameras many, many features.To the cameras amazing feature list  add an exceptionally protective and handy carrying case with internal straps that allow the camera lens to be cuddled by the case and leave room from the neck strap as well...and I scarcely need to mention that the kit comes with a 16GB high speed SD card. I am a confirmed addict of Amazon and this cements that relationship once again. I am SOOooo happy.","I love this camera so far. It has excellent range, the tracking works well on small far away objects, pictures are clear and crisp. I would however note that when extended all the way out, it is best to retract the lens a tiny bit for a clearer picture. I am quite pleased with using this camera for bird pictures. There is one small defect however and I don't know if Amazon can help with this. The lettering on the buttons is already wearing off. I've taken about 500-600 pictures and the menu button is rubbed off and the af/fn button is almost rubbed off. Apparently they are just some cheap silver substance that rubs off after continued use. I don't know if I'd remember all those buttons if they all rub off.  Amazon should this camera be replaced?","I purchased this camera not long after the birth of our firstborn son. It is so much better than the one we had been using. I am able to get a lot of good nature shots, as you can see in the pictures I have provided. The coloring and saturation is great! The only thing I do not like about the camera is that the focus for zooming in is not always very good. If I want a crisp picture, I often have to get VERY close to the subject, which can often be a bit inconvenient (see spider picture). While fairly close, if I try to zoom in the slightest bit, the picture gets all blurry, no matter what setting I use. Other than that, I am able to get some really nice, high quality pictures to share with my family and friends. They have all complimented me on my picture taking skills, but I know that I owe it all to the Panasonic Lumix!","My phone takes nicer pictures most of the time. Zoom is great with a tripod.","Very good quality, easy to use.","REALLY GOOD!!!  After reading reviews I purchased this camera just to go to Yellowstone. I knew that we wouldn't be able to get real close to the animals & some of the scenery. I had my professional photographer, (daughter), look at the reviews & specs. She said that it would be a good entry level camera. All I'm going to say is that she had my new camera in her hands 80% of the time. The words I heard the most was \"I hate this cheap, lite weight camera!!\" I think it had something to do with the cost of her cameras & lenses that was in her expensive case for most of the trip.<br />The biggest down fall that I read about this was the fuzzy pictures. I'm not sure why that happened because there was some amazing photos taken out the side widow at 80 MPH, even zoomed all the way out. Just remember to roll down the window, you get less reflections.<br />So my unprofessional oppion is buy this lite weight, cheap, entry level, camera if you need to get great long range & close pictures.<br />  Over 2,000 pictures, 1 drop of 4ft. on cement, battery held up great, just charge every night. Get a large memory card it helps.","So far so good, excellent camera for the price","I love the versatility of the lens capabilities (the zoom is good and strong).  I am disappointed that the lens cap comes off so easily (my only disappointment).  The special effects on this camera have enabled me to do some really fun things with my photos.  As soon as I take time to read the instruction manual I'll be further enlightened!!  I would recommend this camera.  Highly.","Really enjoying this camera. A very good lens gives sharp images and good color. Everything is simple and works as expected. I intend to take lots of pix with this fine camera.","Just used it for a four day photo shoot of a pro beach volleyball (the AVP league) here in NYC. Got great photos.<br /><br />Used it for a year before that in all sorts of situations and am very pleased. Gotten great feedback from folks as to the quality of the images.<br /><br />Wish the manual of instructions was a little simpler for a few things, but no biggee.","Love it.","Great value. I use for eBay and the automatic feature works great for me.","The seller provided all the info in fast response to all my questions. She even gave me a discount, the price was alps convenient. I'm happy with the camera, it takes great pictures. I use it for work every day and I'm able to zoom into long distances where needed for my industry. I recommend this product and seller!","As if now I'm glad I purchased this camera. I wanted more than a pocket camera but less than a professional lens changing camera. So for I've taken pictures of the moon.... And they are beautiful!!!! I can zoom in on the craters. Anyway I just got it i'm heading out for a 2 week vacation tonight and I'll put it to the test... I do love it as of now.","I love this camera and am finding it easy to learn to take perfect photos. It cannot be used with a remote wire or external speaker. But, I am getting many compliments just using Auto mode and am now using some manual functions well. Lots of youtube videos for this camera. The lens is called a Super Zoom and is way ahead of the herd. I would buy this again in a second!!","The camera came very well packaged. I'm new to product photograhy but I'm very pleased with the quality of the photos, I just wish it had wi-fi.","I'm not a photographer and I don't know a whole lot about cameras, but I've had higher end bridge cameras and can't really say this disappoints at all.  It's not the *super* high quality build I'm used to, but it's not bad either.  Some people comment that this model \"feels like a toy\" but I don't feel that way.  It is lighter than I would think and it's not top notch quality in terms of the grip and buttons, but it's definitely not a toy and would be perfectly adequate for someone who is not a professional but is looking for something more advanced than your typical point and shoot.  Although this camera has been discontinued (it was introduced three years before I bought it), I intentionally chose it for the fact that it has a hot shoe, a view finder, is threaded for filters, has a rechargeable battery, takes 1080 HD video, and ... that zoom.  All of these features will help it to be a more versatile camera than some of the newer bridge models that might have more impressive specs but less options.  I simply could not find anything else in this price range that ticked all of those same check boxes.  I'm not looking to make art house poster prints, just decent point and shoot shots and video from a distance that my phone definitely cannot do so well.<br /><br />I knew I needed a super zoom bridge camera because I bought it for an upcoming trip where I might be 200 yards away from my subjects at times and I'd need a camera that could pull off impromptu zoom shots quickly.  While the zoom doesn't completely blow me away, the picture quality at full zoom is *much* improved over the older cameras I've owned where full zoom shots were relatively unusable.  This camera is not jaw droppingly awesome, but more than acceptable for posting online and that's all I'm after.  I love the video quality, but I'm pretty easy to impress there since my last digital camcorder was bought at a time when HD camcorders were *seriously* expensive and was not HD.<br /><br />All in all it's pretty easy to navigate around the menu, and I'm pleased with the battery life.  Mine came with a 16gb card (the listing says 8gb so that was a nice surprise) and after I had fully charged the battery I set it up to record a continuous stream (to see how long of a video I could capture). 45 minutes later I just turned it off being satisfied that it would be more than sufficient for anything I'd need it for (though admittedly I might not have been on the highest quality setting, I need to play with it more).  I will probably get another battery and larger card just in case, but with what it came with I could've hit the ground running for a day of shooting fairly comfortably.  I'm also pleased with the quality of photos while using the flash; in the past digital cameras have not been known for taking decent photos with a flash and my test shots came out vibrant, not washed out, though with an onboard built in flash there's always some less than desired shadow play and this is no different.  Actually, the saturation of all the test photos I took was fairly impressive.<br /><br />For less than $250 I can't really see how you could go wrong unless your expectations are really out of line for what you can get in this price range.  It will definitely take better shots and video than most phones and in addition to a much better zoom than any phone could ever do, it provides more options to customize your shots easily without taking a photography class.  That's generally what most people who buy bridge cameras are after so it definitely delivers there.  I look forward to using it on my trip and wish I had more excuses to use it on a daily basis.  I'm going to be buying filters and other accessories to enhance that experience, too, since with this camera you can do that.<br /><br />The Amazon price for this is just about the best you can find this camera for.  I'd like to include a fair warning about another online retailer advertising this same camera for $165 though; I tried to order it through them only to be told it didn't come with a battery (they apparently removed the one it's boxed with and tried to up-sell me a battery for either $35 or $50) and despite advertising free shipping they tried to tack on $40 for \"handling\".  Needless to say I cancelled that order and came right back to Amazon to get it since I would have paid the same price but not received the memory card and was dealing with a bait-and-switch seller.  If the pricing seems too good to be true, it probably is... but you can always trust Amazon!","Liking the camera a lot so far.  I seem to be having some issues doing manual focus at night.<br /><br />I ordered a set of lens filter set to go with it for 55mm lens.","Very nice camera for the price you can get it for now...buy it","take very nice pictures","Would recommend highly the FZ200, instead.<br />Panasonic has a well earned great reputation with bridge cameras. The FZ70's extreme zoom power is a trade off for a sharper image.<br />My experience with the FZ200 as well as with the FZ60 (no longer in production), has been incomparable pure joy. So I would definitely recommend the FZ200 instead.","Would recommend highly the FZ200, instead.<br />Panasonic has a well earned great reputation with bridge cameras.

It does  things you wouldn't believe. It reaches so far for you to see thibg you can't see with your eyes. The features are great and the built-in flash is good. For dark shots. For a starter camera it's the best in quality and price.","Purchased this camera right before leaving for Turks and Caicos, very happy that we did! Takes beautiful pictures and not complicated to use. Very impressed.","I misplaced my other Panasonic Lumix and decided to replace it with this one. The price was excellent compared to my previous Lumix. I tried using the Intelligent Auto Mode and was amazingly surprised at the results. With my previous camera I was setting auto focus to a point and auto exposure to a point plus I was bracketing and taking 3 shots of everything.  I compared this method with the Intellegent Auto Mode and found the Auto Mode gave me a much better picture.  Since then, even though I know how to use many of the feature of the camera, I've been finding that the Auto Mode is great. Also, the backlight compensation works great. I've also found that low light photos come out great, too. I found my old camera but I much prefer the FZ70 and use that exclusively. I couldn't be happier.","Panasonic has always been a great source for a high tech product. So far this camera meets my needs and more..","I use this camera as a key tool in my work.  The battery life seems to be better than advertised.  The only thing I do not care for is the location of the location of the exposure control thumb wheel it is always getting changed inadvertently when positioning the camera for photos. I would have preferred it be located in the menu options. Has caused me to take a lot of  (over/under exposed) pictures","I loved this camera take very good photos owner of this 3 years old ago thank you so much.","Great camera, perfect for a beginner at a great price.","60x zoom is incredible.  Macro capabilities are also impressive.","Takes pretty good pictures, but not the kind of pictures I bought it for. After reading reviews, I thought this would be a great camera for taking pictures at the soccer game. Great if there is minimal movement, but no good for running and goal making shots.","Me gusto mucho. Buena cámara","Nice camera for the price great zoom","Great camera. Lives up to the hype.","Best camera EVER, and the PRICE WAS PERFECT!","I bought this camera locally after deciding on the Lumix 3300. I am quite pleased with it. The main reason I bought this was because I wanted to step up to shoot in raw and this camera has this feature. I'm only shooting in raw and been learning how to process raw photos. The pictures are clear even with the zoom. I tested out video taping and again was presently surprised. Taped a whole lecture and the sound was excellent (this camera does not external mike facility). If you're planning to move up from point and shoot, this would not be a bad choice.","Love it a good buy.","Love this camera","seems to work well-like the way it handles--don't like that it doesn't come with a<br />n sd card--gonna catch some people unprepared,","An excellent value from this seller. I gave 4 stars because the packaging seemed to let the contents bounce around. There was no apparent damage, though. Features that would be nice: articulated screen,  a Leica lens, acceptance of a 64g card. But at this price point,it's a very worthy purchase.","YES!!!#","Great little camera with a long reach.  I sure got it at a good price for Panasonic does not make it anymore.  I also have the FZ200 with is equally as good, but does not have the reach.","Its the best point and shoot camera I have ever had.  Its big and really makes me look professional because of its sophisticated design.  I also got bright detailed pictures that were taken in dark areas and poor lighting without the flash.  That technology really works in this camera.  I however had some problems in taking very close up shots without using the zoom, maybe it was my inability to set a function that allows that.","Great camera for amateurs or professionals!  I checked out YouTube videos before purchasing the camera.  Professionals and amateurs praised the quality of the camera and its ease of use which is why I purchased the camera.  With its 60X Zoom and 16mm photos, I get good sharp photos; furthermore, the video quality is a real plus since I like to video my grandson on the football field. You can focus in on a subject (grandson) and lock the focus so that no matter where the subject moves the camera will maintain focus on the subject.  An additional interesting feature is its ability to do panoramic shots with one press of the shutter button and a careful sweep of a scene. So for an amateur it is ideal.  For the professional it has many of the DSRL features found on more expensive cameras.  Love it!","It was a gift for someone who loves photography. The owner loves it.","Great camera, not the clearest, but the zoom works well.","Love this camera, 60x means it has a lens equal top1200mm so you can get real close shots from far away.  Nice controls.  I have owned FZ15, FZ20, FZ27 and now the FZ70.  ALL very High quality, features that others do not have!.  I also shoot the Canon 30D until recently when it stopped working so now using Canon 80D but like this camera for lots of my photography.  I sell my photographs so need quality!","this camera takes very good indoor pictures.  just as good as my nikon d3200 slr camera..  very good camera.","I love it! This camera takes the best pictures.","Muy buena cámara","Takes great Picts, very basic camera easy to use.","I haven't gotten to use the camera yet - BUT - I plan on studying it right away. this is new for me, highly recommended by \"camera buff\" friend.  I expect this to be a positive experience.","This is a qualified rave review.  This camera could have been so much better.  For starters, it could have had a larger sensor to pair up with the giga-zoom lens.  The camera produces nice sharp in-focus pictures so long as you've got enough light and can work <ISO400.  Here's an example!  Otherwise, quality suffers.  So it can fill a niche -- but maybe not so wide a niche that it can be your go-to camera for travel.  After all, those necessary conditions for great results may not always be present.  So -- prioritize.  If the long long loooooooong lens is a non-negotiable item, and you can accept the limitations of the camera -- then go for it.  It's priced right.  Otherwise, keep looking.","Still learning it but so far so good","We are very pleased with the quality of pictures this camera takes. The colors are very vivid and the panorama is better than any camera we have ever had. We also like the fact that it is very light weight and its very easy to use. The functions are very easy to setup. Overall it is one of the best cameras we have ever owned. It always goes with us on vacation.","Amazing Camera! Takes very clear pictures even when handheld, the stabilization is very good! For $209 you get a lot of camera that takes amazing pictures. Highly recommend to anyone that is want to take great pictures without spend a lot. Plus the X60 optical Zoom is great, and the fact that it is zooms out to 20mm is great if you plane on using a stabilizer like the IMORDEN Carbon S-40c","Nice camera, love the zoom, raw features and a good all around camera for the price.","I purchased this for a friend in Maine, to upgrade his old camera that was dying. He loves this camera and the Zoom is amazing!  His photos are truly inspired and he is really having fun learning all about how to use it to get great shots!  I've been impressed with what I have seen so far. I'm sure he will take some truly amazing photos as he learns more. The video is smooth and not fuzzy or jerky in transition. I only know to review from what he has told me, and what I see in his work.  Looks like a great little camera and I know he'll enjoy it for years to come. I also purchased the Panasonic Digital Camera Carrying Case (Black) compatible with FZ series Lumix cameras. Works great as well! Very pleased.","This camera is a great value, and very versatile. The auto focus works well and the electronic view finder helps when using the zoom.  It has nice feel to it without being heavy. I recommend using a lens filter (55mm uv is good) since the lens is not interchangeable if it gets scratched or damaged the camera will be ruined.","This is a pretty amazing camera. 1200 mm zoom for $200? Incredible. The images I get from this camera are as good or better than my Nikon D3300. I also have Canon SX30. Between the three, this one is now my go camera.<br />What about the 1200mm zoom?<br />In one shot you see the shed. next is the lock on the shed shot at 1200mm zoom, hand held.<br />Looks like the VR works pretty good.<br />The cat photo is to show off close up detail of the cat.","A very nice camera, easy to use for those who are starting love photography, although rapidly you will find yourself looking for a DSLR camera.","I love, love, love this camera. For the price it can't be beat. You can zoom onto the moon with it, and I love the retouch options as I don't use photoshop. I take my camera everywhere I go and it never disappoints. Here's a picture I took with it last week.","this is a great camera.  not sure at all how they are able to sell it for this price, but, this is a great camera that will not bust your wallet.","Had the 24x version of this camera and it was pretty good at long zoom.  With this 60x they have improved the stability even more more good focus pictures.  It has more features than I'll ever use.","Great camera!","I have used this camera for a year now. Excellent pictures. Many different controls on the dial, but I tend to use the 'automatic' artificial intelligence mode most. Scenic modes give good results though on the sunset mode the reds seemed more enhanced. Good sharp pictures. Zoom is amazing.","Love this camera.  Versatile and very capable for a sub $300 camera.  Highly recommended.","Let me start by saying I am not a professional photographer by any means. I actually don't know much at all about cameras even though I spent hours reading about different characteristics. I really love this camera. I work in the real estate industry and have used this camera to take photos of some of the properties I have. It takes great wide angle shots and the coloring is nice. One of the best features is that when I take photos in pitch black rooms with the flash on, you can't even tell that there are no lights on in the room. There are a ton of functions on this camera that I haven't used yet, but I think it is great for an amateur and hopefully I will eventually learn more with use so I can use some of the other options. The battery power is great. I really haven't found anything I don't like about this camera yet.","This is a great camera.  You can zoom onto the moon with this.  Great Colors.  Great Camera.  Very happy with this purchase!","This is a great camera.  I can point and shoot or set my own settings.  The zoom is fantastic, photo quality superb.","very good","This camera is amazing.  Takes great shots both near and far.  I am a landscape artist and use my photos as the basis for many watercolor and acrylic paintings. The definition in each photograph is beyond anything I have had before. I love it.  It is bulky so bought a harness to make carrying it easier although it is not as heavy as other cameras of this size.","Very Nice camera - ideal for distance shooting in Nature ... and Full Moon.","Nice \"go-anywhere\" camera when I don't want to take my DLSR rig. Controls are easy and the pictures are ok when using the medium portion of the  telephone zoom. The Panasonic raw files are not recognized by my Photoshop Elements 12. Also the battery is larger than the Nikon and Canon but still holds a good charge.","Nothing stands out with this camera. Same quality pictures as it's cheaper counterparts.","Only good for taking pics outside. Without good day light, doesn't do decent job","This camera has already beat my expectations even though I am still trying to figure out how to use all of the features. I have previously owned other Lumix cameras, and the power of this one is amazing.","I bought this Lumix FZ70 digital camera for my wife to replace an old digital camera with far less features.  The main reason we bought this camera was because it is one of the rare few that have a viewfinder.  This was mandatory since I can't imagine using a camera that doesn't have one.  It is so much easier to frame pictures and actually get what you want without the distraction of sun/light glare that is the nemesis of a non-viewfinder camera.<br /><br />This is simply an amazing camera for the money.  I did a lot! of research so you don't have to and if you're looking for a really well made and solid digital camera with a TON of features for not a ton of money.  One of the reasons we bought this camera was because it has a 60X zoom.  Wow!  We were totally amazed at the clarity of the zoomed pictures we've taken so far.  I highly recommend a tripod when using the zoom but we've taken lots and lots of really great pictures without using a tripod.<br /><br />Another feature we found very useful is the multi-shot feature where you can select this mode and take \"action\" shots of anything.  We use it mainly for bird and animal pictures so that we can capture several shots of a bird taking to flight as an example.  Wonderful feature!  It's really fun to use this one and you will get some truly amazing pictures once you try it.  We're still learning about this camera and how to use all of the other features it offers and we're looking forward to doing that soon.<br /><br />Solid construction, abundant features and a very comfortable fit in your hand makes this camera a 10 out of 10 value.","I bought a Lumix DMC-FZ70 a few weeks ago (February 2016) at Best Buy online after seeing a BB store paper ad with a sale at $149. After investigating on line, I found it was only $129 open box. It came a few days later FedEx with an as new camera complete with manual etc. I could not be more pleased with the deal!<br />My initial experience reinforces the incredible 60x zoom, which appears sharp at the full 1200mm extension, but what reals gets me is the apparently instantaneous shutter release after pressing the button. Also I found a very old Canon flash I used in the old 356mm. Canon AE-1 SLR days worked perfectly when fitted in the accessory shoe. I look forward to using this camera instead of my Lumix DMC-TZ5, which is irritatingly slow to react, has no viewfinder and of course no accessory shoe, even though a good point and shoot.<br />I heartily recommend buying this camera if you can find one anywhere near my price. Much better deal than any similar ones retailing at $300.","I've used this Camera for over a year now. Amazing zoom and amazing image quality. Unbeatable at this price point. No issues whatsoever.","I do not seem to get the clarity I had when Panasonic Lumix used a Zeiss lens.  For an everyday camera it is fine, but if you want excellence of quality in your photos, you should opt for a camera with a better lens.<br />On the other hand, the camera has several photo options and it is easy to charge.  Downloading photos is an easy task.","Awesome camera! Everything I expected and more.","CAMERA IS AWSOME, BUT THE CARD THAT CAME WITH IT WAS BAD HAD TO GO BUY A NEW CARD","I did not keep this camera. Overall was very nice and not terribly bulky, but was looking for something with manual focus, which this does not. If it were not for this detail I'd likely still own this camera.","well i tried it today for the first time. it is a little complicated... but i put it in smart mode, and could not believe the pictures that came out of this camera.. i cannot wait until the eagles come back to florida.. it will be awesome. one of the best purchases i have ever made... thanks panasonic. taking bird photos has just become an amazing hobby with this camera.","It Is a great camera. Nice price!","verrrry good pics and video","This is very good product and the features work good,just found a mode that u can enhance pics with as color might be off due to lighting,works great and clarity of pics at x60 is very good,not a camera expert but do take many pics and play around with different modes available 2 see what looks better","Amazing camera with it's 60x zoom lens.","Fantastic camera, goes to macro automatically- no lens change or button to push - just goes to auto macro. Awesome.<br />Also light, no heavy lenses to carry around. At the price not afraid of having it stolen.<br /><br />It is a great buy  high quality photos, a 1200X lens very nice when you do not want to lug your Canon with its lenses all day.","I have just begun to use this camera and try the different settings.  It is exactly as pictured and was received on time and in original packaging.  This is a step up for me from the typical point and shoot camera.  I bought it for an up coming trip to Europe and wanted a camera with a good zoom.  That was the first thing I tried and the 60X zoom on this camera is fantastic!  It is so much clearer than my smaller 15X zoom on my previous camera.  So far I am very pleased.  This seller delivered as promised and I am very pleased with their service!","It was a Christmas gift so we haven't had it for too long, but so far so good. The pictures are really crisp and it is very simple to use.","I have been taking AMAZING quality photos of my pets since purchasing this camera. I get compliments on the ones of my sugar gliders, and they are NOT easy creatures to capture on camera. Attached is a picture of my baby, lavender.","excellent bridge camera, takes some time to get use to all the features","I have used this camera for almost two years (about 6,000 pictures so far), and I love the camera - especially the 60x optical zoom.  It takes remarkably good pictures in very low light situations, too.<br /><br />For the last several months though, I have been struggling with a rear dial which has stretches where it ignores rotation (or worse, responds as if I were rotating it in the opposite direction).  As the camera is virtually useless without a functioning rear dial, I was rather disturbed.<br /><br />Then I remembered I had recently had problems with my computer's mouse. After an internet search, I found that breathing on the mouse button area - getting some humid air inside the mouse - fixed the problem for me.<br /><br />Having nothing to lose, I tried the same thing this morning with my camera, putting my mouth over the rear dial and exhaling several times to force humid air inside the camera.  Much to my surprise - and relief - it worked.  This sure saved me from having to buy a new camera - at least for now!","good","This camera was recommended to me for an upcoming safari trip by a friend who takes excellent wildlife photos.  I am a pointer and shooter so really wanted something that would be easy to use and have a great zoom.  I took it out this week to play with it, and the photos were crisp and clear.  The 60x zoom is amazing and the image stabilization makes it possible to take decent photos even when fully extended!  Next I'll need to practice taking photos of moving subjects!  All-in-all, very pleased with this purchase and with the Amazon price.","The five stars is not because this camera takes five star, professional quality photos. It is five stars for the value:quality ratio.<br /><br />I purchased this camera on a crazy sale at a B&M store.<br /><br />I didn't have terribly high hopes for this unit, but it is fantastic! While the sensor is not much bigger than on a smart phone, the zoom is amazing and the image stabilization is first rate. I posted some photos I took in Central Park. I was at least 20 feet away in all the pics, probably more like 40 feet away from the raccoon.<br /><br />I am completely satisfied with this camera.","Good Product","Great zoom take bird pic's with amazing quality, will do most any thing the high priced Cannon will do for half the money and weight. Would buy again!","Excellent value.  Does everything I need as a Realtor.  Exceeds my expectation.","Love taking pictures leisurely and as an Architect is obsessed with detail. Decent Camera for a beginner trying out a more professional Camera than regular point and shoot Cameras","Excellent \"Pro-sumer\" camera. Amazing lens - super wide angle for interior shots - real estate agent - and great zoom for nature photography. Versatility without the bulkiness of a DSLR and multiple lenses.","Really great camera for outdoor use. Brought it on a surf trip to Costa Rica and got some amazing pictures. Zoom is impressive and the interface and autofocus make distance action shots clear. Low light shots require very slow shutter and have not proven to be better than my cell phone. But the outdoor performance/zoom more than make up for it.","Awesome,even at high zoom  levels<br /><br />#1: August moon, handheld (braced against patio roof support<br />#2 Hummer at 30 feet, handheld.<br />#3 & #4: contrail at full zoom & contrail at normal zoom( the contrail at the far left (normal zoom is the same one at full magnification)<br />#5 is Orion at 1200mm, 1 minute exposure with camera on cheap tripod.","Great great camera!!  I bought this camera because my sons are in marching band and was looking for a camera that could take long distance pictures.  I am constantly amazed by this camera and I have wonderful pictures of my sons now!  Love this purchase!","I bought the Panasonic LUMIX because I was tired of using my phone to take all of my pictures and I wanted something that had better quality and zoom range. I think I set my expectations a little too high though. The camera itself is nicely made; light and small enough to fit in my tiny woman hands. But i wouldn't call this a professional camera. It takes quality pictures most of the time but sometimes I feel as if I NEED a tripod to take second pictures. Especially if the lighting isn't perfect or its dark out. I've taken beautiful close up pictures of full moons with this camera and it's given me plenty of stunning pictures for my cousins wedding. But when I have tried to take far away night shots, you definitely need a steady hand because it doesn't seem to focus nearly as well as during the day. It's a nice little camera for beginners but I wouldn't recommend for someone who's trying to do photo shoots. All in all, I'll keep my little Panasonic but hopefully I'll be able to upgrade in the future.","decent camera, but just not a real digital SLR.  Movie shoot is good, just not in super zoom.  can't hold still enough with out a tripod and very difficult to find and then stay on target","Love this camera!  It's perfect for my daughter's sporting events, boutique modeling and family get togethers!","Love this camera.  Big plus does not make any noise when taking photos. Can use anyplace without disturbing people around me. Thank you","Have had the FX70 for about 2 weeks and while I'm still learning about all that it can do, both auto and manual, I feel that it has been a very exciting purchase.  Most of my camera experience has been with film, it is really a pleasure using a digital camera that has so many manual controls.  I love what I have been able to capture to date from both extremes, macro to extreme zoom.  It is everything I had hope for in a single lens digital camera!!","I bought this for a forensic photography class at college, and my husband uses it for photographing his table-top gaming models. I earned an A in the class, and he gets amazing photos of plastic and papercraft models. He created a table-top war game (Temporum Oblitus), and he has taken excellent quality shots of his armies with this camera. We would recommend it to everyone!","I bought and returned this camera but am still giving it four stars, which may seem strange, but here's why. The size, feel, and features of this camera are truly awesome. The zoom is great obviously, but so are the menus and things that you can adjust. I tried several modes, and found them all useful. The high speed burst at 9 frames per second is amazing, and in decent light can stop moving people or objects with great detail and without blur, even though it's at a reduced 3 MP resolution, which is still more resolution than a 1080P screen by the way. You have a super wide angle, and 1200 mm on the zoom end. Compared to competitive models anywhere near this price, its features blow the others away. The ability to tweak everything is truly great. You always feel like you are using a high-tech / quality product.<br />Now the bad: Although the image quality is good in most circumstances, sometimes it's not where it should be. The attached picture shows three shots of the same spot, the front of my home, taken from around 40'. I zoomed each picture in a ways on the computer to show the same view, then took a screen shot. As you can see, my Samsung Note 3 phone takes a much better picture of this scene than the Panasonic camera. In the middle is my old Lumix that is now six years old, and the new Panasonic takes about the same quality image. I think it's a bunch of BS that a relatively new dedicated camera such as the FZ-70 can't even come close to matching the picture quality of a cell phone, and I returned it.<br />***I have now purchased a Canon SX50, a two year old model, because I heard it has the best image quality for point and shoot cameras under $500. I saw image comparisons with the DMC-FZ70 and the Canon takes a bit better pictures. In fairness, its features are inferior to the FZ-70, but I'm an image quality first type of person. After taking a few quick shots with the SX50 at ISO 80 you can see the results in my composite picture comparing the FZ70 vs SX50 vs Note 3. I was very pleased to see that the SX50 takes a much less noisy picture of the front of my home, and I think you will agree. Still, I would have to admit that top of the line cell phones seem to take better un-zoomed still pictures these days than a dedicated P&S camera does. Still, I am happy with the SX50 and realize that it can do things a phone simply can’t.<br />If you don't need optical zoom very often, your high end cell phone probably beats any sub $500 point and shoot camera. A DSLR and the associated gear, probably pushing $1000 can at least equal a cell phone still shot in good lighting (up close), and of course can do a lot more with moving subjects, with low lighting and with distant subjects, but you pay a premium for that. The small sensors and low-end lenses of affordable point and shoot cameras are not on that same level of course.<br />If you want a great optical zoom, and find features really important, I would say you will be happier with the DMC-FZ70, if you can accept a slightly lesser image quality in a small percentage of situations. If you have to have the zoom but prioritize image quality over features, and can spend $150 more, get the Canon SX50 (the new SX60 has inferior image quality to the SX50 per several reviews). Keep in mind that you can't get a new SX50 for less than around $320, and the DMC FZ-70 can sometimes be had for half of that, so in terms of bang for the buck, the FZ-70 is the clear winner here, without question.<br />If you don't see yourself using zoom much, just make sure you have a phone with a good camera such as a new iphone or Samsung and don't bother buying a dedicated point and shoot. For people familiar with photography, all cameras had their pictures selected from a group of pictures, and I tried noise reduction, sharpness, and contrast settings to see how much of a difference I could make, and the difference wasn't great. In the end I decided on non-modified shots for the cameras, with stock settings, locked at ISO 100 (ISO 80 on SX50), IS off, and a tripod was used. In fairness if I had shot RAW images and spent some time in Photoshop, I could have increased image quality on the P&S cameras to a degree, but I wanted a straight comparison of JPEGs between phone and cameras.","For the price, this camera is an absolute steal. We are ashamed of ourselves for not paying more.","I've always had good experiences with the Lumix superzooms, and this one was no exception. It just works. I particularly like how it takes video.","Very happy with this camera, easy to use and pictures come out great.","I bought this to replace a Sony DSC- H5, 7 megapixel camera that I have owned for many years.  The Lumix FZ70 came out in 2013 and is a sort of midrange camera, but in upgrading from 2006 technology I am absolutely delighted with what this camera can do.<br /><br />I have been using it for taking close-up photos of coins and have been shooting with the camera set to Macro Zoom mode. That allows up to 3x zoom and focuses in really tightly. There is a macro lens available (You also need an adapter tube to use it), but I'm not sure that I will be needing it.  Another feature I love is the finely adjustable white balance.  The camera's Intelligent Auto mode took a nice looking picture of my cat, but photographing coins under a CFL bulb requires a custom WB setting.<br /><br />I like the camera's right hand grip as it is textured, but not really spongy like some are.<br /><br />I feel that the design is just a little clunky, but it is very functinonal and there is nothing too close to the thumb grip space. (The zoom switch on my more elegantly designed older Sony was in exactly the wrong place and I bumped it often)  I was able to work the menu and do a basic setup without referring to the manual. I did need to read about setting a custom white balance, and the manual wasn't super clear, but it helped me figure it out okay.<br /><br />The included USB cable fits snugly, and I have to tug on it to get it back out, so I'm hoping it doesn't wiggle loose over time.<br /><br />I prefer shooting pictures using the lcd screen and it could be a little sharper, but it isn't bad and there haven't been any surprises once I upload the images to view on a computer monitor.<br /><br />I appreciate the camera's somewhat larger size compared to many of the point and shoots.  I have trouble holding them with one hand and taking pictures, but this Lumix fits really nice. (I wear an XL glove)<br /><br />This camera does everything I need at my coin desk and I expect it will take nice photos out in the desert as well.  I picked it up on sale for under $200 and I think it is a real steal, but of course you will need to evaluate it against your own needs and tastes.","Wow great camera!!!! It's been around the world and back. Great pics and videos! Worth every penny.","Love my camera. Takes outstanding movies and pictures. Got professional instructions on the camera through a store where I live.  The zoom is fantastic.  Took it to Africa, and had great pano and shots close up to the animals.","I'm shopping for a camera(s) that will pick up where my cell phone leaves off.  The phone is great for unplanned photo opportunities but when I know I want to take some photos I want a \"grab and go\"  camera without the bulk and inconvenience of a DSLR and bag full of lenses. I want big zoom, big sensor/I.Q. in a compact package. (you can only pick 2 of these 3 and must make tradeoffs)<br /><br />I bought the FZ70 on sale for <$200 and you get a lot of camera for the money.  The 60X zoom is really a lot of fun and images are much better then I thought.  I just don't know if 60X will be all that practical in real life.  The FZ70 also does Macro down to 1cm.<br /><br />I did have a chance to do side by side comparisons of images taken with the FZ70 vs FZ200.  (the images were a mix of zoom up to 24X, macros, 1X, indoors, outdoors, etc).  The FZ70 usually produced sharper images then the FZ200 but most were nearly identical. (the FZ200's claim to fame is zoom in low light which I did not compare).<br /><br />I'm still on the fence whether to keep it or sacrifice some zoom for smaller size (ex SZ50K) or better IQ (FZ1000) or sacrifice lots of zoom for smaller size and big sensor/IQ (ex: RX100,  LX7/100).<br /><br />This camera performs very well.  I'd be curious what others choose as their \"go to\" camera when the cell phone isn't enough.","Great zoom, great photos and nice to use. Only one feature that I find lacking that was not too clear in the description .  The multiple burst mode. It does have this mode and it is fast but you only get 3 photos in a burst. Not so good if you are trying to capture just the right moment.<br />Takes nice clear video too. Just know you are not going to be able to plug an external mic into it. For the price, This camera is hard to beat.","Great camera for the money. This camera takes wonderful pictures. I would first read the manual unless you are very familiar with these types of cameras. This one even came with a DVD as well as a book for the instructions of operating this camera.","Love this camera.<br />I am a proud mom with little ones that are into different outdoor activities.<br />This is a easy to use camera.<br />I love taking video with this camera.<br />The best part is the zoom!!!!!!!<br />All of my other cameras do not come close to this camera!<br />I am not Professional or a amateur photographer like my husband, this is the reason why I am not so picky when it comes to megapixels.<br />If you are using the Nikon D810A or anything of this caliber it does not come close, but for moms like me it is great!","While I've only taken photos using the automatic setting, I'm fascinated with the telephoto lens.  We have incredibly beautiful, close-up photos captured during a recent trip to Austria!","Note the optics are not as sharp as the Zeiss as on many other Lumix models.  The auto focus is also quite a bit slower and sometimes does not completely focus.  VERY LONG LENS, great for a non interchangeable lens camera.  This is OK to take to most concerts as the lens is fixed and not interchangeable.  Best I have found.","Great camera but there are others that may be better at this point in time. The huge zoom is sometimes unnecessary. Although this may sound bad there are so many features to play around with on this camera. I will leave some pictures so that you can decide for yourself if this is your camera.","Best camera you could buy works like a charm and has a crazy good zoom and also a great deal!","Arrived earlier than expected. Great camera, no issues. Super happy with this purchase. :)","I'm a serious rookie when it comes to photography but this is definitely a great starter camera. It takes beautiful photos effortlessly and the range/zoom this camera has is unbelievable! Well worth the price. Which is a fair price at that!<br />Best of luck! ?","excelent..thank you","awesome!!! best camera I've owned","I've been a fan of the super zoom category since 2001, back when Olympus arguably created the category with the introduction of the C700 with a 10x zoom.  It was ground breaking at the time to have a camera of that size, that much zoom, and at that price point.  I feel the same way about this Lumix.  The 60x lens is an incredible amount of magnification that is usable, hand held, in good light, the image stabilization is that good.  It may be the largest super zoom camera I've owned, but I don't mind carrying it, given it's ability to take long distance shots of small objects, with nothing more than a steady hand (in good light).","I love this camera so far. Pictures are really great.","excellent point & shoot for the money","I am still learning about the camera.  It has a different learning curve than the others.  I am sure, after I have really gotten all the features down, my  photos will improve.","Very powerful camera with great resolution, albeit, the processor is quite slow.  I used it to photograph my Nephew playing high school football.  I could zoom in and get great shots of him from almost anywhere on the field.  The resolution is wonderful, even when zoomed all the way.  Note that, in low light, high zoom photos, the camera will take 2-3 seconds between photos so if you're looking for rapid-fire action shots, get a different camera.  For the price & features and what I needed for occasional shots, it's perfect.  The optical zoom is fantastic.","Good camera, but the lens is not impressive. Macro photos come out rounded or disproportionate. The lighting is also not great with this camera. Unless there is a lot of light, photo coloring tend to come out very \"warm\" and not true to the actual colors of the portrait you're taking. I would suggest looking at the models with the **Leica** lens. Lumix makes amazing cameras, but they should leave lens crafting to the professionals.","Great pictures, all the features you need, very simple to use.","I was blown away by how well the camera did in low light and I extremely pleased with the panorama feature, the writing speed, and its ease of use","amazing pictures","This is a great camera.  Easy to use and powerful.","Awesome, at the right price.","LOVE THIS CAMERA.","it is working good","I wanted a camera with a strong zoom...which it has...I like too take pictures from the Stands at football games....I taken some real good shots with the camera...but with Hand held you can get some blurred shots under the nite lites....I have really enjoyed the camera since I got it........<br />Jerry","This camera is great. Easy to use and takes nice photos.","Takes good photos but I like my Kodak Z-5010.","For the price is a really good camera. I'm still playing around with it because it has so many features and tips and tricks I can't get them all. I love the ZOOM option!!!! Love it.","This camera is insane!  A 20 to 1200 optical zoom?  I bought this for my wife and cannot believe the pictures. They rival anything from Nikon or Canon. You can spend a lot more and will get a lot less. I would not own anything else.","Just received the camera and so far am more than pleased.  Packaging was a little pitiful (tape wrapped, etc.) but survived and camera itself was unmarred.  The bonus 16gb memory card was a surprise..Thanks!","Cameras awesome","Bought this for my wife.  This is a great camera suitable for either an entry level photographer or as an all around general purpose unit with features beyond the price point.<br /><br />Some negative? reviews about features seem unfounded.  For a guy who grew up on Nikon and owned as many as 4 bodies at once this is highly recommended.  If they made a high end unit I could be swayed.","Very good camera","Wonderful camera. Amazing in its quality.","Great telephoto and macro shots. Very pleased with the versatility.","If you have outgrown the digital point and shoot you picked up at your local wholesale club, but are not in the market for sinking thousands of dollars into something overly fancy, the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 is a good direction to go. The interface is very intuitive, so you can learn and grow into it as you go along. I've had it for several months now and it is a pleasure. Really like the handle, so you can really get a grip on it while shooting. (A left handed alternative might be a good idea.) The lens zooms into subjects nicely as needed. Only downside is the manual lens cover. Grew spoiled by auto-retracting lens covers over the years. But all in all a great option for taking better pictures without being too much camera.","awesome camera for the price.","Amazing camera. Takes high end photos and great micro. You can't go wrong with this camera. It's great for beginners or experienced. I enjoy the automatic settings over my big daddy cannon for infant and children photography it keeps up better with the content movement which helps capture pictures without messing with constant changing of specs.","Buena","Excellent camera for the price! Much better than Canon and Nikon. Strongly recommended to those people that want to take pictures without the complication of a larger and bulky DSL.","I wanted the performance of a $500 plus camera and this camera fits the bill exactly for me at much less money.<br />In the Cathedrals of England it takes good pictures in poor light. With the small viewfinder selected it is good in bright sunlight.<br />The battery seems to last forever although an advanced warning of a flat battery would be good.<br />Overall a great camera.  And very light to carry.","This has lots of nice little bells and whistles, and if I hadn't been looking specifically for a good ultra-zoom lightweight camera I probably would be happy. The color is nice. It has lots of modes, but I found that I couldn't really use aperture priority or shutter priority if the light was low, it would tell me to open the flash, so I had to use manual.  The automatic modes are nice, you even have in-camera HDR and panorama mode.  I played with the panorama mode a bit for the fun of it. The macro mode is really a closeup mode, not real macro.  But the main falling point is the ultra zoom. It really doesn't give you 1200mm.  You have to lower the megapixels per shot to get more zoom, resulting in a fuzzier and fuzzier picture.  No 16mp shots at 1200mm.  I think you might get it at .03 mp, the smallest number. I went down to 3mp, and got fuzzy pictures at 108x (120 x is the maximum range of the lens).  See my collage of bird pics at  https://www.flickr.com/photos/11815777@N07/21994187512/ .  Obviously this is a great little camera, but not if you want good bird shots.","Love this camera easy to use the 60x zoom is great good plain photos I took a pic that was over 1/8 mile away from me and they turned out good and clear no blurriness money well spent...","I love the wide angle and large aperture.  The picture noise leave the quality much to be desired.  Practice focusing, too, as the sensors can through the whole picture out of focus if I aim off by just a hair.  But then again, I can't beat the price for what this unit does.  The accompanying menu does not cover much more than powering on, so I have to search for YouTube tutorials.","A great camera. Huge zoom feature. Easy to learn and use the bells and whistles. I have two 20x small cameras that I love, too. One thing that I like about Panasonic is their picture menu system that lets you easily in one place select landscape, portrait, food, animals, sports etc etc. All their cameras use this same easy menu. For the mentally challenged as I am learning cameras this feature is so helpful ! ;-))","I have had this camera over a year. It has been quite durable and dependable. And I have been able to get a few outstanding pictures with it. However, I have tried virtually every setting, adjustment, and recommended fixes I an attempt to attain sharper image quality.  Unfortunately, it just is not going to happen.  I don't claim to be a professional but crisp photos seem to be impossible to attain. Maybe I expect too much of this camera and it does have many great features including the remarkable zoom, but if you have a discerning eye and are particular about image detail, I have to say this camera has been a disappointment.","Bought this camera a little less than a month ago to take with me on our family vacation to Hawaii.  Camera came in a timely fashion since we have Prime.  I would not be happier with this camera.  This is the largest camera we have bought ever (we had previous lumix point and shoot cameras, but nothing this big).  The Auto/Intelligent option works very well and we are very happy with the pictures we were able to take with this camera, especially in the Botanical Garden near Hilo.  There were a lot of people with much larger cameras than this taking detailed pictures but I don't know how much better they are than those taken by this Lumix camera.  Overall, love this camera.","I've owned this camera for seven months now.  For the most part, it has been satisfactory.  Colors are usually pretty accurate, exposure is good. My main issue is that the focus, especially the auto focus, is rarely sharp.  I have to post process sharpen every photo, which is a pain in the neck. And yes, I do use a tripod most of the time.  As a side note,I wish someone would make one of these \"advanced bridge\" cameras with an aperture smaller than f8.  That just isn't good enough for landscape shots.  All in all, if you want to take tack sharp photos, suck it up and save for a DSLR with a set of good lenses.","I love this camera!  I bought it for the long zoom and have been truly impressed.  It takes great videos even with the zoom, but I had to purchase a monopod to help steady it--it can be hard to keep it on the subject when you've really zoomed in.  The colors in my pictures have been very vivid, too, and it does well in low light.  I am particularly impressed with how well it did taking a picture of the moon--it looked more like something you'd see through a telescope.  It doesn't do as well with action shots as my Canon, but I'm still happy I bought it because of the great zoom and the price was much cheaper than any of the other cameras I looked at with comparable zoom capabilities.  I'm just a point-and-shoot kind of photographer, and though it has lots of settings I will probably never figure out, it's simple enough that even an amateur like me can take great photos.","I'm very happy with this purchase.  Bought a certified refurb unit for a little over 200 bucks- great camera for the $$","big for a point and shot","Love my camera!! Takes amazing photos! Didn't know it came with a neck strap, so that was a plus for me. Also comes with batteries, so I could use it right away! It just snowed here in KS and it takes amazing snow shots!!","Easy to use, sharp pics, great zoom. Comfortable to carry. Helpful \"scene\" settings.","I am very happy with the cameraPanasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black), great zoom as expected. I have been using it over a month. Although I really love this camera I think that the image quality should be better (because of that I do not give 5 stars). Video very nice and 3D pictures really works on my smart tv. I recommend this camera for people that want to make telephoto pictures (after 2000 mm zoom quality is not good) or travel/city. If there is needed hight quality pictures for semi-professional purposes this is not your candidate.","I absolutely love, love love this camera! I upgraded from a Lumix 20 so the transition was pretty simple.","Thanks so much, very nice looking camera, light weight, came newly packaged, fast delivery.","Easy to use. Takes clear pictures every time. Worth every dime.","Bought this as a gift but am so impressed, I'll be ordering one for myself!","I'm not a camera pro......just a long time user.<br /><br />The 60x zoom is great.....handy having that built in and available.<br /><br />The review mentioned that in the zoom mode there was a delay in focusing on the acquired subject.  I  did have this experience and I did miss a few photos due to the slight delay.  Infrequent, but annoying.  Not catastrophic.<br /><br />My big problem was a malfunction on this new camera................it lost the image on the screen on the back of the camera.  Here's how:<br />= in the normal position, the camera worked as expected<br />= No Leica lens like my small point and shoot Lumix has.............and I am pretty sure I could tell the difference....clarity.  But the Leica is way more money.<br />= Problem/malfunction was - if I rotated the camera 90 degrees for a \"vertical\" shot so to speak, the image ..................disappeared - the screen went black!  I thought it was too much sun that overpowered the screen, but nope. I angled the camera a bunch of ways trying to avoid too much light, but It just disappeared.  Called Panasonic, they had no explanation.  I m sure this is a one off situation, peculiar to me.  If it were a common problem, I'm certain we'd be hearing about it.  So, thanks to Amazon, I sent it back.<br /><br />I might try this same camera again because the price I paid...if I can find that price again.......was pretty good for what I got.<br /><br />Sent the unit back and migh","I bought this camera simply because of the awesome zoom range... I believe it's the only super zoom camera with the 20 to 1200mm range. At $227 price here on Amazon, it's just one heck of a deal if you ask me. Is the photo quality as good as  $3000 to 5000 dollar large sensor camera's with 2 or 3 different expensive zoom lenses that you'd have to have to get this same zoom range? No, but it's a few thousand dollars less expensive too!<br /><br />Now, with that being said, I am actually pretty pleased with the image quality out of this camera and even find the low light abilities to be pretty good as well. I don't need to use the flash even inside with low lighting and the pictures come out pretty good. This camera has numerous different settings, more than I'll ever use. But I find the automatic settings work great for almost everything I want to do. I'm not a professional and not a photography nut either.... but I'd say this camera gives me as good of pictures as any I have ever owned... and given that's even when using the massive 60X zoom, I am VERY pleased with this camera.<br /><br />The video recording works pretty good on this camera too. Now don't be fooled by Panasonic saying it will do 60fps, this just isn't true and is a mis-leading thing Panasonic puts out there. If you look at the specs where they say it can do 60fps, you'll see an asterisk that says the sensor output is at 30fps.... you know what that means? It means this camera will only give you 30fps output, not 60fps. They arrive at 60fps by duplicating frames. So you really aren't recording at 60fps. This is not an issue for me with most of my video recording and the video out of this camera actually looks very nice. But if I am recording something with lots of high speed motion, I would use my Sony Camcorder or GoPro so I have the actual 60 or 120 fps recording speeds.<br /><br />In conclusion without getting into techy stuff, for this price range, and having the massive 60X zoom, I'd say this camera performs exceedingly well! I find the auto modes just simply produce great pictures very consistently, it just works! It also has many manual settings you can use as well, so I think it's a great all around camera. I think this is the camera I will use most often.<br /><br />I've attached some pictures to show the quality in varying lighting conditions. I've ordered them in sequence so you can see the zoom progression from near to far. All these pics were taken in intelligent Auto mode, except for a couple that I shot in HDR.","Great camera for the price. Solid low-light images. Great zoom. Long battery life. As hobby photographer, I found this a very solid addition to my iPhone 6 which I often use for quick pictures. This camera is much better at tradeshows and similar areas where lighting is not ideal. Still haven't tapped half the options, but if looking for a solid point and shoot camera, can't go wrong with this one at this price.","best camera  ever!","I love this camera.  I have two large DSLR's and all the necessary lenses plus a few, and have not used either of them since I got this camera. It is sharp all the way to the end of the zoom. Pictures compete well in quality to my DSLR photos.  I have had a few learning curves but like it better each and every day. I take dozens of pictures daily as I am older, have trouble walking and love wildlife photography. I cannot say enough nice things about this camera.","This camera is my first DSLR camera, and it is everything i want in a camera, great distance, great res, great for taking photos in nature as well as sports photography","Great range with the 20-1200 lens.  I'm still learning all of the features, but so far I'm very happy with this light and easy to handle camera.","great camera. Haven't explored it fully, but in the last few months of use it has been great. Zoom is great.","nice camera for 180.00","Awesome camera. ! Easy to use ! Love it","Great simple camera to use.  Telephoto capabilities  are wonderful.","Great deal fro a great camera","I owned a Lumix camera before but due to some unfortunate events it was broken, and instead of getting it repaired my husband decided to get me a brand new camera. I knew right away I wanted a new Lumix because the photos come out amazing, the camera is easy to use and all the extra features are all so fun to play with. I have a family of 5 and nothing is more important than the memories we make, and with my Lumix those memories will not only be saved, but look as crystal clear as the day they happened.","I thought I was totally in love with this camera until every time I turned it on, I had to wait several minutes to take a photo.  Also, when I want to review a photo, the little hour glass pops up and I have to wait to look at the photo I just took.  What gives?  Initially, I could just turn it on and take as many photos as I needed to and as quickly as I could.  Being in Glacier National Park, the zoom was great and got great shots of bears and moose and birds.  But, what gives with the hour glass making me wait to take photos?  Can anyone give me an answer?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I have had this camera for two months and thought I had found the perfect point and shoot automatic, but now I am wondering if I made a good choice.  The price was right since I bought it on Amazon, but I am still disappointed.  Thanks, Sarah in Georgia","Takes great close up pics.","First let me say that the FZ70 is an incredible camera and a real bargain considering all that it does. But it was not up to the purpose that I bought it for and I finally returned it.<br /><br />The main reason I bought the camera was for bird photography, especially to use that cannon of a lens to bring birds that are far away up close. And if it wasn't for the fact that I have a DSLR and am used to the quality of the images produced by a much bigger sensor, I probably would have been somewhat ok with the FZ70's output. The main reason for the purchase of the Lumix was economics pure and simple. To buy the equivalent lens range that the Lumix provides in a DSLR instead, you better bring a boatload of money and be prepared for long and large lenses that are not easy to carry or use in the field. So I thought to myself that if the image quality was reasonably close to that from a DSLR, then maybe buying the Lumix was a good all around compromise that I could live with even if it wasn't the best choice for the kind of photography I had in mind.<br /><br />But here is what I found after using it in the field:<br /><br />1. The optical zoom is indeed incredible and a pleasant surprise. The digital zoom however degrades the image very quickly and for me was not worth using.<br /><br />2. Regardless of whether I used RAW or JPGs the image quality was just simply lacking. The kind of detail that I am used to in wildlife photography using a DSLR is missing. The images have a kind of look that I can only best describe as \"thin\". There is a serious lack of depth and detail that a larger sensor brings to the game. I am not what I consider a \"pixel peeper\" but I do like to see that the resolution in the images I produce is high quality.<br /><br />3. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the excessive noise that was produced even at low ISOs. The camera I got was loaded with noise if you shot in anything but the brightest of conditions. Again this is mainly due to the sensor size.<br /><br />Conclusion: This camera would be fine for those who simply want to take pictures of family at a soccer game and want to bring the action up close. Or those who like to take a camera with them on vacation that will take long telephoto snapshots. It is NOT however for those who demand high image quality such as you will find in a DSLR. It really is a shame to have to say that because I wanted the FZ70 to be the economical solution to large, long and expensive lenses such as is used in a DSLR system. But alas, the reality is this kind of bridge camera does not accomplish that goal at this point. I know that because I bought another bridge camera that is a competing model just to be sure that my conclusions were correct, and although it was slightly better in image quality, the same failings and limitations were still present in it as well. At least for the kind of photography that I enjoy.<br /><br />Before I bought this camera I read all kinds of reviews online and most of them seemed to indicate that the FZ70, while not completely up to DSLR standards in image quality, was not that far off. I am writing this review because I found that in real life that is not the case, and I wish that more reviews on this camera had been honest and truthful about this subject.<br /><br />Once again, I am still giving this camera 4 stars because it is a technical marvel and for most people who are not photography enthusiasts it will perform admirably well and provide the kind of pictures that they would be very pleased with. But for those who demand more in terms of image quality because the kind of photography they are passionate about demands it, this camera and others like it are not the answer. Maybe technology will get us to that point in the near future but that day has not arrived yet.","Nice camera. Takes great photos and also nice videos. Used it on a trip to Ireland and lots of people were envious of me when I started taking videos of people dancing in an Irish pub.","Book I received with it was not in English","Everything about this product and the seller is awesome!  Item arrived quick, safe and sound.  From the moment I grabbed the camera I could feel the quality and it does take awesome pictures.  Focus is clear, exposure in automatic mode is spot on and the range of the lens makes it the perfect one camera does it all solution.  I am going to sell my multi lens DSLR because this is a lot more convenient and with equal or better results.  Extreme zoom situations best use tripod.  You will not be disappointed!","Very nice camera for non-professional! Easy to use and good results.","Does the job, love that camera!","Awesome camera. Love the quality of the zoom. It's my 5th Panasonic and I'm very impressed with this product.","Excellent Camera. Very much impressed with battery life. I have many cameras whose battery life lasts maximum 2 hours. But this camera's battery did not completely drain even after continuously recording video for 4 hours. Video is excellent. I love this camera. Highly recommend to others who are undecided about which camera they should buy. Price is also within $300 which is very impressive.","GOOD!","I recently purchased this camera after my previous Lumix fell off the table. I went to my local camera shop to see the different brands out there and liked this one. I went home to research it and was happy with the reviews. I found this cheaper at Amazon and purchased it. When I went on vacation recently, I enjoyed having this camera with me. The zoom is amazing and the picture quality was beautiful, I am no pro at taking pictures and I will probably never use all the functions but, this camera is incredible! I have tried uploading a picture 3 times to this review but it isn't working. This camera is definitely worth the purchase!","For the most part a great camera.  BUT viewing on the screen or through eyepiece is not good.  Hard to compose a shot and clarity is fair.  Now a new problem.  Using camera at elevation over 10,000 ft when the image wasn't even remotely sharp through eyepiece or on screen.  Took pictures anyway.  Nothing showed on card.  Back to home at 7000ft, all ok.  Temp at elevation was ~low 40's. How could air pressure cause this problem?","Have been taking practice shots and the camera is very easy to use.","My wife loves it. Nice and light, great zoom.","I love the zoom-great deal","Very Nice!! Love it","Great camera","This has been my main youtube camera for pretty much a year now and the only reason I'm upgrading is because in the tech community its all about the video quality and I just needed to upgrade to a DSLR camera. But other than that I'd say that this is a really killer camera for the price. You can get some great photo and video out of this thing and it has killer zoom. 60X!!! So if you wanna see some photo and videos that this camera can produce go check out my youtube channel AppsOnFire for my camera test of this camera!","perfect price and a good piece","So far everything about this camera has been wonderful.  I haven't had a nice camera since my old 35mm went out of style and I gave away the lenses to my son.  This does so much more, simple to use and takes great pictures.  The zoom is especially great for this price.","Very good camera, it works great and very easy to learn to use.  Takes very good pictures and it takes them fast.","I've owned this for about a month and a half now and have for the most part enjoyed it.  I had a Panasonic Lumix previously, so this was supposed to be a slight upgrade over it (especially the zoom).  I would describe my photography style as \"lazy\".  It isn't that I couldn't fiddle with the settings, or that I don't at times, but I enjoy just setting it to Intelligent Auto and letting the camera do all the work.  The problem I've found is that at times this camera just takes blurry pictures due to it not switching to a good setting.  It also tends to take a lot of dark images.  At times you think you've taken a good shot and get it back on the computer and realize that it is in fact blurry.  Our previous camera's didn't have that problem except in some very particular situations.  Then again it can take some really nice shots too and the zoom is really incredible.  Overall it is a really good camera for the price and I am glad I purchased it.","If you're looking for a more-than-capable camera, whether it be for ultra-zoom, or even because you aren't quite sure you want to make the investment for a DSLR (with all the lenses and such) I think this camera is hard to beat. I've been using it for months now, and it is, hands down, my go-to for every day shooting. The menus are jam-packed with functionality, and, if you're like me, post-processing is minimal in most situations. I love this camera, and it has truly increased my confidence level in taking stunning pictures...<br />It's a blast to play with and to find just what 'style' you prefer for images. I can't say enough good things about it!! As a matter of fact, I can't really come up with a negative at this point.","I absolutely LOVE this camera!  It replaces a Sony dslr that I've had for 7 years and it does everything and then some!","very goog","The DMC-FZ70 is all the camera you need.  It comes with a lot of features and accessories that may surprise you.  The built in lens goes from 20mm (Wide Angle Lens) to a 1,200mm telephoto lens.  There is no need to pay for or carry extra lens when they are built in.  I have rental units and interior pictures never capture the whole room, until now.  I can use the 20mm setting to take 1 picture instead of 3.  It shows so much better when you can see all the features in a room in 1 or 2 pictures instead of 6.  The 1,200 mm lens means that I can photograph a license plate or suspicious person from more than 250 feet away or more when needed.<br /><br />The camera comes with a great case, branded carry strap, built in flash, built in microphone, and is tripod mountable.  Sorry to say you will have to buy your own tripod.  There are several settings on the camera that make filters unnecessary, but it will take any standard 55mm filter you may want to use.  Don't even consider accessories until you have the camera and use it a couple of times.","I wanted a super zoom bridge camera because I take a lot of bird photos but couldn't justify the cost of upgrading to a DSLR right now.  Before I bought the LUMIX, I had been using a Fujifilm SL300, which I loved but which didn't quite have the power I wanted at 30x zoom.  The Panasonic camera has mostly met my expectations, with clear optics for the zoom (with a tripod, of course) and options for manual settings that allow me to tweak my shots.  The Intelligent Auto setting is surprisingly good in selecting the correct settings for the scene you're shooting, although it doesn't always give me what I want, hence the need for the manual settings.  With a 60x optical zoom and macro lens settings, this camera gives me both power and versatility.<br /><br />Some reviewers have mentioned how big it is, and because I couldn't find it in stores, I was nervous.  I was relieved to discover that it's NOT big for a bridge camera, only in comparison to a point-and-shoot.  The LUMIX is the same size as my Fujifilm, just with a wider lens.  There's a bump out on the right for gripping with a nice area for my thumb on the back of the case -- we lefties have always had to adjust for a mostly righty world, and I have no issue holding the camera with my right hand.  I'm not going to stash this inside of a handbag, but then again, I didn't expect to.  When I'm using this, I wear it around my neck or over my shoulder.<br /><br />The LUMIX has too many features to include in a customer review; however, several of them are worth noting, especially for those who want to use this as more than a point-and-shoot:  manual settings for aperture and shutter speed; the ability to program shift; focus locking; the option to switch from LED screen to traditional viewfinder; pop-up flash; shoe for separate flash; continuous (\"burst\") shooting mode, with or without autofocus, up to nine shots.  Point-and-shooters will be familiar with the scene options, and, of course, the camera also takes video, although I never use it for that.  I also never use the \"creative control\" feature since, if I really wanted special effects, I'd do it on my computer, not with the camera itself.  Although anyone can pick up and use this camera, it takes some practice to get used to the settings and features for a more enhanced photography experience.  Don't expect the LUMIX DMC-FZ70 to equal a DSLR, but do expect it to be much better than a point-and-shoot.  My only disappointment, and hence the half-star deduction, is the inability to use a remote shutter.  Most people won't care about this; however, for bird photography, I could really use it at times.<br /><br />The camera comes with a battery (buy a spare!), a wall charger, a lens cap, and a neck strap.  You'll have to buy a case if you want to protect it and don't already have one.  And don't forget the memory card.<br /><br />In comparison to the Fujifilm I already owned, the Panasonic is almost interchangeable except for the zoom power.  Both are excellent bridge cameras with roughly the same size and features.  The stability feature on the Panasonic might be slightly better, and it includes a few extra options; however, I consider them to be comparable cameras.  The real issue is deciding on the maximum optical zoom power and whether you need it.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann","What a gem!  This thing is amazing for the price.  It still tickles me to know I got this much camera for this little money every time I pick it up.","It's not a DSLR, but for the price it's an incredible camera. Exceeds all my expectations.","I'm a long time Panasonic fan.  I like to take travel / tourist pics and have no mad photography skills.  Just got back from San Diego where I took pics at the zoo and the Safari Park.  This camera zoomed in to the big cats faces so well.  I got some great shots.  And, best of all maybe, it did a good job of getting past the wire to the animal at the zoo.  The larger size is a little unwieldy to compared to the pocket cameras but it really takes great pics.  Recommend!","So far the camera is meeting and beating my expectations.  It performs as well or better than the DMC-FZ8 it is replacing.  The rear dial for exposure compensation as well as other settings is a great improvement over the earlier camera, as is the F stop vs shutter speed display when you are in these more manual modes. This camera takes standard 50mm filter and sun shields which is also an improvement.","I use it for the first time on my trip to the Oregon this last week and those were the best pictures I ever taken.  This is the best camera I have ever own.  I even had people  complement me on how nice my camera was, that's a good feeling.","Fulfilled all expectation","GREAT CAMERA","Good product, good seller, no more comments.","I agree with many others that this is one of the best cameras you can get for the money. A great starter camera or even for veteran photographers that are looking for lots of zoom without the cost and weight of DSLRs. For only $250 (at the time of this writing) you get 1200mm range, insanely wide 20mm photos, and a camera that takes above average photos even in fairly low light. It also has allot of nice manual modes to go along with a very smart auto mode. It focuses pretty fast and pictures look good until you get really far into the zoom. Then you either need a good tripod or better lighting to take a really good pic from range. Impressively I was able to follow some aircraft while keeping long range zoom most of the time. Although once you do lose focus, it's hard to find it again.<br /><br />The main reason I got this camera was not for the picture quality but for the Movie Mode. I like documenting fast moving high altitude aircraft like Contrails and Chemtrails (Yes I said it) and many other interesting things in the sky. Since there seem to be hardly any decent Camcorders with any kind of serious zoom range, I had to look into Photo Cameras. The movies that this camera does take are quite impressive in terms of audio and video for a camera mainly meant for Photography. But one of the reasons I chose this camera other than taking decent photos was for smooth 60 Frames Per Second Video. The claims that this camera can do 60FPS are completely false because after you really dig, you find out the Sensor is limited to 30FPS. So even though the video may be encoded at 60FPS, you only see 30 because the sensor is limited to that frame rate. This is not a big deal to probably 90% of people that buy this camera but some want a dual solution for good photos/video.<br /><br />I'm now returning to try out the Olympus SP-100 that seems to have similar features as the FZ70 with a little higher price tag. Along with high speed video modes and a better motion tracking system for birds or other fast moving long distance craft. It seems true lifelike 60FPS is very hard to find on superzooms. I will miss the 20mm wide photos that this great camera is capable of.<br /><br />Again I want to point out that I rated this camera 4 Stars and find it to be on the best values out there for a camera period. It just didn't completely fit my needs of what I expected in a very competitive Superzoom field. For others who don't care about the stuff I mentioned, this is a 5-Star camera in most every way when you consider the price tag.<br /><br />UPDATE: I tested out the Olympus SP-100 and the Lumix totally destroys it. The noise on the Olympus is terrible and almost unusable in low light. The picture quality is smartphone quality at best. The stablization is poor and does not look like 60FPS either like it claims. ARRGH. Guess I'll have to be satisfied with the Lumix as there is not much in the way of high framerate video for superzooms.","I purchase d this as a gift for my son.  His birthday is in August 15 and he is turning 15..  The packaging was slightly damaged but the camera appears to be undamaged.  This was a camera he was wanting as he is interested in photography","Camera was more then I expected!! I love it!","I originally did not like this camera but after using it a few more times realized it was me not the camera. I am use to Canon cameras. I got a fantastic shot of the Blue Moon this month and am now going through the advanced user guide. I have not had a chance to use the camera extensively and find it is different than other camera brands in the way it operates or even uploads on line. I bought it for the zoom and the zoom does not disappoint.","Nice!","I am not a professional photographer at all, just wanted to be able to take better pictures than my phone could do. I am beyond impressed with this camera for the price it is! So many different features available and such an amazing zoom. I recommend reading the extended instructions that come with the CD to learn some tips and tricks to the Panasonic FZ70 if you're new like me. It's going to take me quite a bit of practice to learn all the functions, but this is a great camera that can simply be used as a point-and-shoot. The first night I got it, I took a picture of the moon and was astounded when I was able to see the craters! Absolutely amazing! I'm looking forward on taking this camera on vacation to capture beautiful pictures of landscapes & family!","After two short photo shoots, I like this camera a lot.  It is similar to my Nikon that I loved but that went out of focus too often.  The zoom and macro zoom are great.  Most of the settings are intuitive.  The weight is good.  The viewfinder is about what you'd expect.","nice camera, my first shoot experience was awsome able to capture good pictures.","Brought this camera with me to Europe for a backpacking trip. Couldn't be happier! It was easy to use, durable, and really portable. The picture quality was fantastic. The panoramic function was probably my favorite, I've attached my favorite as an example. I was also really pleased with the battery life, over a month of constant use I only had to charge it twice. The lens pops off a lot, which is a downside but the camera bag is a good protector.","This camera takes very good pictures, most of the shots I have taken  are very good, clear and crisp shots most of the time. Can't ask for much more, but ill invest in a better  camera down the line when i have about 800 dollars to spend but for now it dose the job well for taking nice shot of my family wherever we go.","I just got this Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 camera a few days ago and so far...WoW!  (bought refurbished from Goodios here on Amazon).<br /><br />The main reason I needed a new camera was for the optical zoom. We have a lot of \"flora and fauna\" in our yard and I like to take pictures of the various critters and plant life to share with family & friends. Obviously, I can get up close to plants and flowers, but the critters are another story.<br /><br />The maximum optical zoom I have on any of my older digital & 35mm cameras was 3X - 10X, which just wasn't enough to get good quality images from the distance I needed, like 100 feet.<br /><br />I took a chance on the refurbished model from Goodios on Amazon because it fit my budget much better.  Aside from a 90-day warranty, the only thing different from new and refurbished seems to be the box; the refurbished is shipped in a plain brown box, but everything is there that would ship with the new camera (CD, manual, lens cap, USB cable, shoulder strap, battery, and charger).<br /><br />I'm still playing with all the MANY settings (automatic and manual) but so far, this is an awesome camera for the money.<br />It doesn't have Wi-Fi connectivity, like some of the more expensive cameras, which I was aware of and really don't need. So if that's something you want, take that into consideration.<br /><br />It does have Panasonic PhotoFun software that opens up when the camera is connected via the supplied USB cable.<br /><br />You do want to get an SD card (Micro SD w/ adapter). I picked up a 64GB SanDisk on Amazon for peanuts (compared to what they used to cost not so long ago).  SanDisk Ultra 64GB UHS-I/Class 10 Micro SDXC Memory Card Up to 48MB/s With Adapter- SDSDQUAN-064G-G4A [Newest Version]  and it's working great!<br /><br />If I'm out and about and absolutely \"need\" to send one or more of the photos on the SD card in the camera, I can remove the Micro SD and pop it into my Samsung Galaxy S5 phone to email or message (or any phone that accepts SD & Micro SD).<br /><br />I've attached two photos that I actually did take early this morning. One is the non-zoomed photo (trees in our yard); the other is the squirrel that I zoomed in on in the same trees in the first photo.<br /><br />Overall, I completely recommend this camera. If anything changes in my opinion, I will amend my review.","Love all the great features it has! Unbelievable! I wont let anyone hold her but me :)","This camera is the bees knees, especially for that price. It is perfect for backpacking and hiking photography as you can get great zoom, professional quality, without carrying a massive kit.","Bought this to replace my Sony Cyber-shot HX300 (50x optical zoom) as I was unhappy it malfunctioned less than 18mo. from purchase. Pros: better light for cloudy days, crisp pics of stationary close-up objects, 60x Zoom and price.<br />Cons: takes too long for auto-focus, pics are grainy and motor noise is annoying.<br />I did not need to use a ti-pod w/the Sony, but feel it may be necessary with this Panasonic for better results.<br />I might add, I am strictly an amateur, that enjoys photography as a hobby.","I purchased this camera locally 6 months ago (slightly cheaper). I can't say enough good thing about this camera. I own a full body Nikon (which I love) and wanted a smaller model for certain times and situations. The 60x zoom is fantastic on this camera I can easily get awesome moon pictures that show details of craters.  Takes excellent pictures is dark lighting. Has all the same features as my larger camera once I became familiar with how it worked.  As for those saying the stabilization isn't as good I've had zero problems with that at all. You can't go wrong with this camera weather it's an extra camera for the experienced photographer to a novice who wants to just point and shoot. Great value for the price.","The wife and I didn't need a Digital SLR with all of the bells, lights, and whistles. Nearing retirement with grandchildren we want to continue to add pictures of, and a need to keep it simple. This camera does that and is capable of so much more than we will ever use, and the price, wow. We are extremely happy with it. Upon retirement, with a little time on my hands I plan on exploring some of its' fancier abilities.","I LOVE TI!","Had this camera a few weeks now and still really impressed. Zoom is great but as others have mentioned, need to hold it steady for long range shots. I like the panoramic shots also. Bought SD card to go into this on a warehouse deal, so watch out for them. And also a filter to protect lense and camera case. Price of this camera is dropping all the time in retail outlets, so while Amazon was still the best price when I bought it, you need to do your research.","I love this camera.  For just about 30% more cost than a pocket camera, it way outperforms one.  I got this before my Alaska trip, and boy was I happy to have it.  I got some bear pictures that look like I am in dangerous territory even though I could barely see the bear with my naked eye.  Awesome zoom.  The quality of the pictures are also quite good.  You can digitally zoom up by quite a bit and still have resolution adequate for printing.  It has lots of bells and whistles that I've yet to start digging in.  On the down side, It feels like it would probably break if I dropped it from a foot.  I've been careful so far.  So I don't know if it would handle a drop.  Since I don't really know, I cannot knock it.  Due to the picture quality per price alone, I highly recommend this camera.","I strongly recommend it.","Amazing camera. Absolutely love it. Takes great pictures and even has great quality pictures zoomed in from far away. I love that it has the digital screen as well as an eye piece to use if you are unable to see your object on the digital screen because of extremely bright conditions,etc. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants a professional quality camera without having to pay that professional camera cost and without having to buy several different separate lenses.","The perfect camera easy to use and great pictures. Used for the first time on my Alaska trip the zoom was great to get pictures of the wild life in Denali national park.","I can not say enough about this camera it's a great product iam happy with the way it performed<br />I attached a flash an wow. 5STARS should let you know how I feel about this product.Also the service was super.","GREAT camera at a GREAT price.","Excellent camera! Lightweight. User friendly. 60X Zoom range is amazing for clear, detailed photos.","A camera like this has some limitations, but if you want pretty good pictures a long ways away, this is one for you.<br />I had a FZ100 and I think it is more durable, but so far, the FZ70 takes better pictures.","Bought this as a gift for my husband just as a quick easy to use camera for when he doesn't want to carry his bulky DSLR.  The speed, zoom and picture quality is great.  Looking to buy one for me.","Awesome camera, very well priced, and the quickness of the delivery was amazing.<br />RC<br />Rockwall, TX.","I love the FZ70, at least what I've figured out how to use. It's quite a complex camera(at least for a digitally confused man), the instructions are relatively adequate, but going on to U-tube I was able to see some of the workings in action. Probably just how I learn better, see one do one kinda thing. But the photos are beautiful and when using a tripod I got some terrific shots of the moon that showed more than I'd been able to get with previous cameras. It has a multitude of scene variations as well as numerous programs that do most anything you would want a camera to do, from total automatic to total manual operation and anything in between.<br />I was able to purchase a factory refurb unit for a great savings, and I believe from the reviews and what I've experienced from the limited use so far I believe I found a real diamond in the rough !","This worked beautifully for me. Got great shots of our family in the Outer Banks a couple weeks ago. I'm not anywhere near a pro photographer, and can only speak to the ease to use it and the shots I've taken. I am extremely satisfied.","very good it was like new works real nice lovely pic still getting uses to the zoom","Great, easy to use and takes fantastic pictures.","It is a great camera and the price is great","I have been overall very pleased with the camera,my suggestion,for the money,buy it!!!","Love this camera. Long Zoom, excellent picture quality. The best value considering it has a 20mm wide angle on the low end with  fast F2.8. It is much more valuable than extra zoom that some offer. Speed of this camera and its focusing is amazing. Awesome value.","Love it.","This is an amazing camera. Lightweight and easy to carry. Sharp optics and incredible optical zoom. You cannot beat this camera for the price!","New to the camera world outside of the iphone and after a short discussion with my son I am taking some good pictures which I know will be great pictures in the future.","Just getting around to doing my reviews of some products I bought and I must say this camera was a great deal and I am pleased to say that over a year now and I am loving it!","Everything was perfect, down to everything they said, word for word,,they did it\"","Love It","Great camera!","Wasn't bad, especially for the price compared to the competition, but some annoyances.<br /><br />- Has a old fashioned lens cap, tied by a string to the camera. Kept clanging around, and ended up in my shots more than a few times. I am used to the lens protection that is automatic on the front of the lens whenever you turn on a modern camera.<br />- Kinda big and bulky, for mobile, action photography. Hard to hold and do things, like walk your dog. Especially when you're used to a cellphone, or gopro.","I bought this camera for my daughter for her 14th birthday.  We just returned from a family vacation on safari and her pics are better than mine...and my camera was A LOT more than what I paid for hers.  It's intuitive, easy to use, takes good video and the digital zoom is great.  It took her about a day to teach herself all the features.","buyer beware, my Nikon P520 has a greater zoom then this one, the lumix is NOT 60X.  @840mm mine has MORE telephoto ability than this one.","Excellent super zoom bridge camera<br />Price is cheap for the quality of this product<br />Nikon makes huge dslr but for the price and feature/ benefit ratio Panasonic is surprisingly great<br />Arrived on time<br />Package super secured<br />I do recommend this seller with enthusiasm","Excellent camera","Excellent digital camera for the price. Have other more expensive cameras but feel this is excelent for normal needs.","Nice camera ,great zoom ,for the price you can't beat it..........no regrets<br />,","Surpassed all of my expectations.","It has a fantastic lens: I was at a high school graduation, about 200 feet away from the band, but was able to get a clear close-up of the drummer (my grand nephew). It IS very complicated, meaning it has many, many options -- but I have to confess that I leave it in intelligent auto mode and use it as a point and shoot. It has most of the capability of an actual SLR at a fraction of the cost. The down side is its bulk, it will not fit into most pockets.","I got this for my Dad who is 84.  He is an excellent photography and has always used Leica cameras.  However he can't use his Leicas anymore because of a hand tremor.  I selected the Panasonic because of its ability to control stability.  My Dad is now into photography again and taking amazing shots with this camera.  He is also getting into computers and digital photography at 84 because of this great camera.","Everything works as stated.  Little bulky and the auto focus sometimes takes few seconds to \"focus\" but picture quality excellent and love the zoom.  Video also good quality, transfer to computer no problem.  Wish it came with a case.","more than I expected clear pictures","Camera works great. Does what I want","Awesome camera. It does everything well! This is a hybrid camera. It has the full functionality of an SLR, but the ease of use of a point and shoot. The ability to control the depth of field is taken to a level of simplicity that is genious (there is a wheel that is also a depressable button that changes control mode... aperture, shutter speed, etc.), allowing for \"on the fly\" control of the lens.  Sometimes it seems a bit slow to focus on distant objects, but when it does, the optics prove they are excellent and the pictures of objects taken at high distance (even in low light) are amazing. Highly recommend!","Auto focus, tracking, and zoom not as good as advertised. Better off spending same money on quality point and shoot with lesser zoom. Manufacturing packaging not the greatest either.","Worth the price. Not as good as an SLR off course but pretty good.","good camera  a little heavy and bulky but good pictures and easy to use","Excellent all round performance Lens quality better tha my Canon.","I've been using this camera for about 3-weeks and think it great! Oh, I could have spent twice the money on a \"better\" camera, but for my needs and the way I use a camera this one is just perfect. And, it seems - so far - the camera very well made. Note: I've owned Lumix cameras before so the learning curve (how to use the camera) is shorter. I'm very happy with my purchase...<br /><br />A note on Amazons' packing... I was not at all happy with the packing. Amazon packed the FX70 in a box 3-times larger that the camera box and the amount of packaging material was next to nothing. So, the camera and the factory box rattled around inside the 'too large' Amazon box during<br />shipping. Luckily the factory box 'absorbed' any problems so the camera undamaged.","I bought this camera because I noticed that my iPhone was outperforming my Panasonic DMC-FZ100 by its' ability to stop a tennis ball in flight. The iPhone has a feature called HDR that permits better photos of rapidly moving objects. The DMC-FZ70 also has this ability. I tested it and it also stopped tennis balls in flight. I wanted this capability for sports pictures and because I have young grandchildren that seem to be in constant motion when I want a picture. I also wanted the telephoto ability for sports and wildlife photos. It would cost a small fortune to get the telephoto ability for a DSLR camera.","I was looking at a Canon Powershot SX60, but the retail is $480.  friend bought one for about $409. Then I found the Panasonic DMC-FZ70 for $189 refurbished with no tax and free shipping! I read the reviews, and it sounded pretty identical to the Canon. I'm a near-professional photographer with 40 years' experience using every type of camera imaginable. I also like a bargain. So I bought the Panasonic. Even though it was refurbished, it arrived without a scratch and in perfect condition. It's an amazing camera; does everything; has all the bells and whistles; the viewfinder is essential for any ultra-zoom camera. Most importantly, it's so sophisticated that you just point and shoot your way to photos that will impress everybody. No fuss. No mistakes. Get this camera. It's a steal.","Thrilled with this camera! I know that reviwers here who buy expensive SLRs and (for some unkonwn reason) compare this camera to those and they are less than trilled. This is the camera for the rest of us who just want decent pictures and will probably never make large prints or posters from our pictures. I've used this for outdoor shots and very low light indoor shots of school cermonies. I'm all thumbs and know nothing about photography. My shots and videos at 40 to in the 50s zoom we crisp and sharp. I looked at the images on a 40 inch high def TV and it all looked amazing, like Blu-ray movies. I had no 'soft' images or video. I just held my breath and shot. The custom features take some getting used to and you have to really study the manual. Once you do, you can get some amazing results butin several auto modes, scen modes and semi manual modes. After web research I chose this over the Canon PowerShot SX50. It just seemed like they were abouteven and this is $100 cheaper.","Everything was excellent.I am very pleased with camera.It come at the time,and it is like described.Only problem is booklet.Not very helpful.But I am learning.","Bought this for my husband because of the huge zoom feature.  He loves it!  You definitely have to be careful to be VERY steady when it's zoomed all the way out because the image can tend to be grainy in certain lights and if there's any movement.  But, he's taken some really great images at full zoom and it's always surprising how close he can get.  It's lightweight and small enough to carry around all day; all the other buttons & functions are easy to find and similar to our other camera.  Not top of the line, but definitely a good value.  Recommended for an affordable camera with lots of function.","Amazing camera and price! Great supplier and partner with Amazon","This was purchased as a gift for my husband and he loves it! We are avid birders and he is using this to take photos of birds. The photos are clear even at the maximum zoom (even though you REALLY need to keep your hands steady at this point) and the quality is incredible for the price. The photos have aided us in identification, and we end up seeing more than we thought we saw (my husband snapped a picture of what he thought might have been a chickadee, and it turned out to had been a prothonotary warbler!!) If you are hesitating about getting this, don't! Just get it! It is amazing bang for your buck!","So far it looks just like what I was hoping and expecting.","Of all the cameras I have had, this is the absolute best.  From now on, I do not think that I will ever use my other camera.","This camera has a fantastic zoom at 60x.  In sunlight I can hold it and take fabulous pictures.  I have a tripod and recommend it's use in low light.","This camera has been amazing so far.  Only had it for a few days, but am impressed as is my wife who has a Canon 6D with a couple $1000 lenses.  Bought this so we could just take some decent easy everyday shots without lugging around my wife's camera.  What I've observed so far is that the flash is great!  It actually makes pics look better rather than washed out and over exposed.  The zoom is AMAZING.  I get amazing detail and pictures from a hundred yards away.  Took it to the San Diego Zoo and got best pictures ever of multiple animals like I was 5 ft from them.  It also focuses great!  The pics are sharp and crisp.  So far the camera has been pretty intuitive, but I'm going to have to break out the manual for the burst mode.  Can't find it.  Also, not sure how the aperture priority vs the shutter priority works.  Wife tried to explain, but this will take some reading on my part.  I'm below an amateur.  The only real things I have to compare to are two different Nikon point and shoots I tried previously.  The Nikons provided a blurry picture and the zoom didn't focus making it unusable.  If you're looking for near DSLR quality at a good price, size, and weight I definitely recommend this camera.  I'm contemplating buying another one for my wife who really likes it as well.","I returned my camera. I really wanted to love it.  The price was great.  My troubles were with it focusing.  I wanted it for bird watching, grandson pic taking, and vacation photo ops.  When I was taking photos of birds, if I could get it to focus, it was great.  But more times than not, when I zoomed into the bird it was just a blur and I lost my opportunity.  Even on the same bird shot, if I got one clear, it would then blur and I couldn't get another. I tried on both manual and automatic settings. I tried for about 3 weeks and gave up.","I have use the camera to take about 500 photos [at 16mp] and 20 videos [at 720P]. The quality of both photos and videos suprised me. Even at full 60X zoom [in sun], the photos were focused and the colors pretty accurate. Indoor photos with flash had to be white balanced but came out pretty good; though I liked the color balance better without flash. When I am watching these photos on my 27\" monitor they are pretty good; however, if I digitally zoom in 2 or 3 steps, the photos pixilate, show noise [especially when camera automatically switched to iso 400 or greater] or indicate they were not focused over the entire photo [espec. if depth of field was over 10-20 meters]. Check out sample of Panama Canal on a rainy/cloudy day, and statue in Guatamala on a sunny day with plants.<br /><br />But for a camera with a 1/2.3\" sensor and such a great flexibility in lenses and shooting mode- I am very happy with the quality of photos and videos I got with this camera. I recommend it to anyone who wants a fairly cheap and light, very flexible super zoom camera; and doesn't need the photo quality of a DSLR or 4/3 camera,","Best zoom for this kinda camera. Love it!!","I love my camera. I bought it for my graduation and I'm glad I did","More than expected.","First, I'm a complete novice in serious photography.  This camera is meant to get my feet wet, get me familiar first hand with the 'issues'.  That said, my rating is great, 4 stars.  Some things could be more satisfying to me so not five stars.<br /><br />Zoom, clarity, basic ease of use are very good, 5-star worthy.  The combined weight of the negative factors below is only enough, to me and for now, to cost the 5th star.<br /><br />Grip point on the camera for hand shooting is small (ok, I've big hands), somewhat awkward in location versus camera mass and makes me feel I'll drop the camera.  The image stabilization is the best I've used - compared against phones and an old, cheap camera I have - but not quite what I'd hoped for.  Auto-focus is sometimes strangely flaky.  Battery life is 'meh', I'm buying a second battery to work around that.","This is a near perfect blend of capability and convenience in my opinion.  It can capture surprisingly good photos (and videos) in all kinds of situations.  The eye viewfinder is a big plus as well as being nearly silent.","Many great features. My first one was unfortunately damaged. I have a Nikon and a Cannon of similar type but like this one best. The only negative is it doesn't have a movable monitor screen like the Nikon.","Camera exceeded my expectations for it ease of use.  This is my first \"real camera\" and I am very pleased with it.","Great features of this camera: 1) the 60X zoom, of course; 2)  one can quickly switch between taking pictures and recording videos by pushing a button; 3) there is very little time between pushing the button and the picture being taken; 4) lots of fun picture effects and pre-set scenes - in fact, probably more than I will ever need; 5) the automated i-mode can produce good pictures in a wide range of settings, and allows for some customization of the shot if desired; 6) the macro feature can get you very close to the subject; 7) the camera can take pictures in RAW mode; 8) it can take panoramic pictures.<br />Not-so-great features: 1)The display is fixed instead of being able to swivel to different angles, which may make it hard to take pictures holding the camera above the head or of objects on the ground. 2) It takes a while to save the pictures, so if you are taking (with the zoom, of course) a series of pictures of your graduating kid you better stop before the kid gets too close to whomever is handing out the diplomas (thank goodness for school photographers). 3) Sometimes when there are strong variations in illumination in a picture the results can be quite bizarre, such as completely white faces on some people while others close to them look normal. I suspect that using the RAW format would prevent this, but I usually stay in the auto modes.<br />I am also wondering why all cameras I have used, this one included, seem to have the battery compartment next to the tripod attachment, so that if the battery runs out while the camera is mounted on a tripod one must remove the camera from the tripod to swap batteries.<br />My previous camera was a Sony Cybershot, which seemed to produce clearer, more detailed pictures. I don't know if this is due to the fact that the Cybershot had great quality optics or to the fact that I am still learning how to best use the LUMIX. I suspect that the LUMIX optics may not be the best, but they are certainly functional. So far, after a couple of months of ownership, I am quite excited about this camera - it is very versatile with a great selection of fun possibilities, such as the \"miniature\" mode. I have been able to take decent pictures of anything from the moon to bugs to family members. The zoom performs best with a tripod, like all zooms, especially when fully deployed, but the software does a good job compensating for instability when the camera is hand-held. There are better cameras on the market, but this one is a good value for the price, at least in my opinion.","awesome, just awesome..canned my cannons and sony and got this takes as good as or better than my cameras that cost 6 times a much","This camera was too heavy for me. So I had to return it. I'm sorry I can't give a better review.","Been using it for 6 months now and love it.  Nice pictures and awesome zoom.  Some pros might nit-pic but good all-round camera.","I love this camera.it is like having a small telescope as a lens.the color and quality is really good.i bought this for the zoom capability but am surprised at the versatility.it will not replace my canon eos rebel t3i but i carry them both while out taking photographs.the price was fantastic and am more than pleased with the camera.I would like to add that I added some close up lenses and found it takes amazing close-ups.this is a really good camera.","This camera has replaced about $3000 worth of my  camera equipment. This is a great camera;  it does it all with the exception of a remote plunger port.","Amazing camera. Takes great great pictures.","i bought this to take to spain and it arrived 1 week prior to my trip.  it is an upgrade from me from a much older version of the lumix.  i also have a canon rebel t2i that i keep a tele lens on, so i got this to have for wide angle shots so that i wouldn't have to change lens' on my canon, but i could not afford another canon body before my trip, and since my old lumix had always satisfied me with great pictures, i thought this would be the best choice for me.  i was not disappointed.  i am still on the learning curve, but am very pleased with the way it is working and it is easy to handle, lightweight and just all around a very nice bridge camera.<br />my only wish is that i could find more youtube instructions on how to work everything on it.  it is very different from my canon dslr and yet also has a Lot more than my old version lumix, so i am a bit at a loss on how to work some of the things on it. it's been a bit of trial and error and some frustration and uncertanty on what i am doing right or wrong...  the instructions that came with it are useless!!!  but that doesn't take away from the quality of the camera itself, so i still give it a 5","This DSLR-Like camera is so far the best option I can find if you are not planning to invest in a DSLR. It has all the feature of DSLR except the lens is not interchangeable, and most importantly, the Image optical stabilization and zoom is excellent. It is also fast and take great low lights photo. If you are not planning to spend a lot of money and want a great camera, then this is the best option you can find.","Love this camer photo are so nice this camer you can shot every thing","It has a great zoom. However, it is not a DSLR camera so do not expect DSLR pictures.","I've owned this camera for a couple of years - it has traveled with me to Europe and to Latin America, as well as various hiking experiences across the Western U.S. and Canada.  This is truly an overlooked gem in the very crowded market of one in all cameras.  The super zoom is the highlight of the camera of course, and I've taken excellent shots of Macaaws sitting on a tree branch several hundred yards away- far better shots than I would have taken with the Canon Rebel and long range zoom lens I had before.  Lightweight and easy to use,  this camera is very everyone!","very good!","An amazing camera. I am having so much fun with it. A professional photographer friend told me jokingly that he hated me because it took him $15,000.00 worth of camera and lenzes to get that kind of clarity and closeness with his big 500 mm lenz and his Nikon. This camera is light, filled with fetures and again it is so much fun.","This is a Very,Very good camera. Recently i took womderfull pictures in New York.","This is a fine camera. The colors are rich and true and well balanced. The camera is well balanced and fairly compact. It handles well. Controls are intuitive. I love the magnification and have some great shots because of it. I am very pleased with this purchase.","Excellent camera","Christmas gift","[[VIDEOID:e0d4149c7bf824a0952083f89f2a3488]]Amazing wide angle and zoom. Few bridge cameras have 20 mm focal length. DSLRs do provide that kind of width but not compact cameras. It has a zoom of 1200 mm. Other bridge cameras give a zoom higher than 1200 mm but they wont have the minimum of 20 mm. The autofocus is fast during the day ,slightly delayed in low light but acceptable. The pictures are taken in low light and one of them is at full zoom of 1200 mm in the night.","Great camera for the price. Need to learn how to use it.","I wanted to replace my old LUMIX that met its end on the delivery room floor (excited big brother). It was a compact point and shoot that took great pictures and was easy to use. This takes great pictures as well, but I am still learning to use it. The manual that comes with the camera is not comprehensive and refers the user to the online manual. I believe I will still get a smaller point and shoot LUMIX to meet my needs for day to day snap shots.","Quick delivery from the store, very reasonable price, and good customer service. Decided to return due to poor perfromance in low light.","Have had it only month. Great so far. Superb 60x zooms of highest Rockies and 3/4 full Venus on tripod.","I've found myself using this camera more than my Nikon camera lately and I've fallen in love with it. I still have a lot to learn about it but I must be doing something right. Friends see the photo's and tell me that they want my camera. I'm a new photographer and I'm learning a lot with this camera. I feel bad that I only gave it 3 stars ar first. It definitely deserves 5. I just had to give it a chance to prove itself. I've attached some photo's to show you what it can do.","This is a GREAT camera! I was able to take nice photos on automatic when I first got it --and now that I'm tasking a photography class it has all the features that you need to take great photos on the manual setting!<br />I'm VERY happy with it !","love this camera, does very close zoom and very far away zoom<br />need to spend thousands to do any better","I had to practice a lot to learn how to use this camera for it is more complicated than any I have ever used before.  Manual settings are available for almost anything I want to do, but I've had to refer to the digital manual a great many times.  This is no point and shoot camera, although it works great for that too.  I had much difficulty learning how to get macro photos without blurring, but eventfully got great photos. The macro-zoom is something I did not expect and I'm super-pleased with that.  I can adjust the lighting, color, focus and get almost any type of photo I want, though for general use I leave it at Auto-focus +.  I like to take photos of insects, flowers and birds, so the manual settings are of great importance to me.  I also wanted to do time exposures, and although I would prefer to be able to set long time exposures, the longest exposure in this camera did permit me to photograph the aurora borealis with the use of a tripod, and the touch-up function.  The 60x zoom is very useful to me and I've photographed quite a few birds already.  It is very difficult to hold the camera still at the 60x level, but using a tripod for a bird is impractical when they are moving around.  I have to take several hand-held shots to get a good one, but usually succeed.  I am very pleased with this camera and it is everything I hoped for.","Love it, but it can not use the Eye-fi memory card with the wi-fi feature.","I brought this camera almost 2 years ago and is amazing how well it still stand vs many of today's camera.<br /><br />When I saw the x60 zoom I was blown away and sold already,  but after reading and research the specifications and features of this camera the decision was easy.<br /><br />Normally point and shoot cameras are only that, and you need to spend a lung and half of the other One to buy a DSLR with the flexibility and zoom range of the fz70, be ready to spend 1000's for lens and lens to catch with my fz70.<br /><br />I been reading online forever about the p900, I love the camera too, but when ppl says is the most powerful zoom at the market is a lie, the p900 is a x83 optical zoom vs the x60 on the luminix, that's on optical, but when we change to digital zoom the things changes drastically,  while the p900 total zoom is x332, the panasonic fz70 is x675, yes I know it sounds unbelievable especially when no even panasonic published those numbers On the same way nikkon promote the x332 online.<br /><br />I know my review is too much about the zoom and I omitted lots and lots of features this camera have like the hot shoe, the always hand full viewfinder, settings about aperture, image stabilization,expandability,  great iso, and many others that you could only have in a mega expensives DSLR's cameras.<br /><br />There's a lot of good cameras to choose from now, but from my humble opinion the FZ70 is the best investment a tech say on budget could do.<br /><br />Note: never said I'm a pro or have more knowledge than anyone,  this review is based on my personal opinion.","GREAT Camera and it is worth the cost. You'll be pleased.","So far so good. I read a number of reviews of the camera b/4 purchasing it. Like reviews of any product, some recommended it and some definitely did not. But for me, so far (limited use to date), I like it a lot. It is light, easy to handle, and I like the quality of the pics I have taken (using auto-focus) to date. I like the camers.","Great camera.  Very easy to use!","I don't like leaving negative reviews but I really was not satisfied with the pic quality of this camera. A lot were grainy and the image stabilizer was not good at all. It feels very light weight and thin plastic also. I returned it and got the Sony DSC-HX400 and wow what a huge difference in everything.","More than happy, this is the right one for beginners like me!","We love the camera. Great Zoom! Pictures are great! We'd recommend this camera","AWESOME camera...ordered this because I have had the FZ28 for years and absolutely loved it...and the 60X optical zoom made this a must have with some vacations coming up. Ease of use is essential and this camera is a gem.  The pictures come out sharp and crisp.The weight is slightly heavier than my old one but not enough to become a problem, and I like the feel of a solid camera in my hands. If you need only a \"pocket camera\" this won't be the camera for you, but if you don't mind sacrificing some size in order to have the zoom capability, seriously check this out!","LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera. I have gotten some excellent shots.  It does more than I have learned to use but I am looking forward to continually learning more about it.  I sell real estate and it has been a great camera to get excellent photos of my listings. The only con is the lens cap isn't real snug but it isn't enough of a con for me to take away a star. so 5 stars it is!","Good camera","This is a great camera! Takes wonderful  clear pictures. Easy to operate well worth the money.","Amazing product and great price. Everything was \"out of the box\" new. Love it.","The zoom is fantastic. The macro is better on the  Lumix DMC-ZS19 . The photo's are much better than they appear on the camera. All over, I am pretty satisfied with this camera. It's a bit heavy when trying to shoot with the lens fully extended so don't try it in the wind.  I have been taking some pretty amazing nature photo's in the Florida Keys where I live. I would recommend it to anybody that doesn't want to carry 5 lenses when traveling. I","The zoom is just amazing to see!!!!","Great camera, lots of features to explore.<br />Point Shoot Amazing.<br />Amazon does it again, Now I'm smiling.","excelente","Am just getting acquainted with this camera but already love it.  The powerful zoom, the lens quality, the lightness of it, and simplicity of use are all plusses.  The video function provides clear footage with good sound quality too.","I have had the Lumix ZS6 for several years, and love it.  It served me very well in Ecuador and Switzerland. I love that it fits in my purse or pocket.  Nonetheless, I was fascinated with the idea of the 60X zoom, especially for birds and other wildlife. Or shy people who might not feel comfortable with a camera staring them in the face.  So much easier to grab a photo of a bird and then look it up than trying to get one in binoculars and memorize the details before it flies away.  This is bulky, no doubt about it (compared to the compact).  I love it anyway.  It is light weight and ergonomically well designed, easy to hold.  I will keep my compact, of course, but this one has it’s place.  Here’s the range you can expect.  I took  these pictures this week.  I had to take most flower pictures more than once to get a sharp enough image, and they are cropped here (which brings them even closer).  But gorgeous enough!  I can hardly wait for a full moon!  If you drag the cursor on to the picture, it will enlarge it significantly, so you can see the detail.<br /><br />The camera is easy to learn to use.  There are a few features I haven’t mastered yet, but only a few, and i’ve only had it a few days.","Until now, we are not using this camera due to its bulky size. Hope Lumix can make a camera as small as canon's.","Absolutely incredible camera.  I have gotten close ups of birds that normally would take a 400 to 500mm lens.  It works wonderfully in good light.  However in low light or if there is a lot of movement, the camera has trouble focusing but in good light and without fast movement, the camera is miraculous.  I love it and bought one for my son, who was also astonished by its lens power. I highly recommend it even though it has the flaws I mentioned. The animal pictures it has taken are of National Geographic picture quality.","Having had a Sony Cyber shot stolen from my home during a burglary, I was looking for a replacement without having to spend a fortune.<br />Camera reviews give me headaches- i I am an amateur photographer these days and the days of using manual settings of an SLR are long gone.  I want a camera that is easy to use for trips, takes nice photos that can be blown up without losing clarity, and has quick recovery - fps.  the SONY was slow.  I also like a camera with terrific zoom capability without my having to carry around a large camera bag packed with various lenses.  My initial impressions of this camera is that it performs all these functions up to my expectations.<br />Better than that - retail according to Costco was $299, but I have seen actual retail at $399.  They had it for $249 - when I went back to buy it,a week later they were sold out - only the display unit was left for $210.  When I asked about it, without my even asking for it, they dropped the price to $170.  The battery pack was never installed so what could anyone have done with it on display?  Cosmetics are perfect,and having charged the battery and taken a few photos, so far I am very pleased - especially for $170!!!","I bought this  camera for my daughter in the USA and she loves it. I have the FZ72 and I am more than pleased with it as the stabilisation counteracts my shakes.","so far we are very happy!","Nicely made, zoom is great, low light level performance is poor, not good for sports photography.","I love this camera. It takes wonderful pictures and I love that it also takes video which is hard to find in a camera like this. I love the zoom that this camera has. I like this camera better than the Nikon that my mom has. I think that it takes better photos and hers is much more expensive and hers doesn't do video.","I bought this take pictures at live concerts, as the zoom potential is great for arenas when you've got nosebleed seats, and most venues won't let you bring in cameras with a detachable lens. I think it suits well for this need, but remember it's not a DSLR, so don't expect superb quality. For what you're paying, though, I think it's fairly good. Low-light performance leaves much to be desired, I might even go as far to say the newer iPhones might rival it. That's depressing... but there's not a whole lot you can do about that at this price range I think, and your iPhone doesn't have 60x optical zoom or 16 MP resolution. All things considered a good buy.","The camera has it all.  Nuff said.  Also you can use ISO up to 800 and still get quality images.  If your interested in a grip for the front of the camera just go to the internet and check out \"grip for Canon Power Shot S110.  I purchased on, and it works great.  Helps keep a better grip on the camera since it is so small.  Cost about $10.00.  And worth it.  It has an adhesive backing that really holds tight.  All in all, a great compact with ability to make great images.  Good luck with your new camera.","Great camera for the money. I use it mainly for videos and the zoom. It is perfect for that. It also has a super fast focus. The quality of the photos are good. I think there are better cameras out there if you just want to take pictures, but that is all in how much you want to spend. I would definitely buy this camera again. I'm not a professional photographer though.","Trying to get used to camera.  Some low light situation seem to be an issue.","The longer I use it, the better I like it. The feature of pictures modified is useful for my art work. I've used a smaller camera so working with a bigger one is my only challenge. Haven't yet needed to recharge the battery. Seems longer life.  It is a large one though. Won't want to spend more for a \"better\" camera. Always a deal is great!!!","I bought this Camera 1yr. ago. For the money.. IT IS GREAT.  I had bought a Kodak PIXPRO AZ361 a few months before, which is another, GOOD low cost camera. With a Zoom of 144x. I found I needed a Higher Zoom, I found that You can Get the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 to go to 675x Zoom ! .. A Extension Tube,and 2x, 2.5x Lens are also available, separately. Auto features work very well, Manual options let you control shutter speed to 1/4000 sec. which is a rate of cameras of twice the price.<br />  This camera is has a really nice Camera, The ONLY negative I have with this camera is that the lens is a fixed mount. BUT at 675x Zoom who cares.","A wonderful camera, has all the bells and whistles and gives great photos who are rather basic in it's use.","This is such an easy and fun camera to use.  I'm not a professional.  I have had several Canon's - the last being a Rebel Digital. This camera far exceeds the Rebel's ability.  The first day out with this camera I was able to capture a bald eagle in a tree with the excellent zoom (that the Canon would have never picked up).  I love the features, the ease of use and the video ability.","This camera is a great camera for me.  As a realtor it captures a nice wide angle of the houses and rooms for my listings.  I highly recommend it for the price.","excellent camera for beginners in the world of photography","Love this camera. Its easy to use and photos look great!","It's not exactly DSLR but it's close!","I'm still learning this camera. It is a lot of camera for the money and initially I am very pleased with it. Hopefully it will never display Batteries Exhausted warning and require $100+ repair like Canons and Nikons.","Perfect!","Its an older model , has a few scratches. Bought it cos it was cheap","A good camera for someone who is used to point and click, but wants to get into more advanced settings.","This is a superb camera.  Can't believe all the functions and especially the great zoom.  It is quite fast, even hand held photos turn out well in extreme zoom mode. Macro mode is amazing as well.  Also, bought this used for an amazing price and it is virtually a new device.  Am really pleased.  Thanks Amazon.","If you are looking for a camera with good zoom capabilities, check this one out.  I was able to see the numbers on a mailbox from 2 blocks away.<br />The camera is easy to hold and has excellent stability, even at extreme zoom levels. I haven't used a tripod yet.","Best camera we have ever owned send the zoom is unbelievable, thanks","Great camera/ camcorder. Great price. Thanks !!","Great camera! I highly recommend setting it to -2 noise reduction for better image quality, though. Can't beat the price and value.","Great product, sharp lens, easy to operate...","Good camera. Lots of nice features. Easy to use. Takes good pictures.","I purchased this camera to take whale watching as my DSLR was too bulky.  it's great as its lightweight,  has an incredible zoom.  only down side:  fisheyeing and distortion if subject is close up.","This camera is truly amazing. These are Venus, Mars, Uranus (from left to right) - almost perfectly aligned. Taken with optical zoom x60.","Excelente","Huge zoom, fun filters, decent battery life, I would buy it again","THE MOTION PICTURE RECORDING CONTAINS INHERITED NOISE THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE. IT COULD BE ENGINE NOISE OR STABILIZER. CAMERA IS GREAT EXCEPT THIS ANNOYING NOISE WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN MOST CHEAPER CAMERAS.","Great value","Really like this camera. I have shot professionally in the past and this camera offers me almost ever option of a DSLR. But it is so much more compact and easy to carry, as well as shoot pics. With this camera I don't have to loose time switching lens. It's all self contained with an incredible zoom range.","just got this  in today and it really seems to fit what I need for me trip next month to Vietnam. I thought I would regret buying this camera after hearing about the soft images but once you change the std to add contrast, sharpness, and noise reducer images become way better. overall i'm very happy with the purchase.","I have a very lengthy history with point and shoot cameras. I am a professional photographer so I suppose that I am spoiled by DSLR quality however Panasonic has never let me down. I bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 when it first came out. I was thoroughly impressed with the quality for the price that I had paid. Concert videos came out great and a lot of the photos were really good too. I still have that Lumix and my son now uses it.<br /><br />After dabbling with DSLRs for a while I decided that I wanted a more professional level point and shoot. I bought a Canon G12 and while it had some impressive features it just was not what I expected from the reviews I had seen. It was okay during concerts (one of the main reasons I have a point and shoot) but it wasn't something I was excited to use. After I sold the Canon I went to a Nikon Coolpix. I am an avid Nikon fan. That is the only DSLR I shoot with so I figured the point and shoot would be just as good. I was wrong. The quality of the photos was horrible and I couldn't get a clear shot to save my life. The Coolpix quickly went back. I stuck with the Panasonic Lumix ZS3 for a while and then went to a Nikon N1 J3. Again, not great. I did not like how it handled but I have kept it around for a year.<br /><br />I was browsing reviews for cameras that are great for my upcoming trip to Disney. I saw this Lumix FZ70 listed so I did some more research. After reading reviews here on Amazon as well as other sources such as Ken Rockwell I decided that I would jump on the low price that I paid. Yet again Panasonic did NOT disappoint. I got the camera this morning so I have not been able to fully test it and will definitely update when I do, but from what I have done so far today...IMPRESSIVE. The zoom is ridiculous and much clearer than I expected it to be at 1200mm!<br /><br />Below I posted a macro shot (holy crap!) and also posted a shot where the lens was at the shortest and then the longest length to show the power of the zoom. In the shot where you can see the entire street I put a red circle around the car that I zoomed in on. The red circle is in the center of the photo, far far down the street. I cannot wait to get out there and test this camera's capabilities in Disney in a few months and then at a concert in May.","Absolutely perfect camera. Will never stray away from Panasonic cameras again. They are the most reliable and easiest to use!","Very accurate, very sharp, very useful zoom range.  Lots & lots of useful features like in-camera HDR and exposure bracketing.  Excellent, easy to use exposure and color temperature controls.<br /><br />The bad news.  The same camera was selling for $30 less just 10 days later.","Everything I wanted and more! I bought this camera specifically for bird watching. It's really hard to juggle binoculars, bird books, and a journal and trying to identify before they fly away. I wanted a quick point and shoot that had the ability to zoom in so I can see the bird's features. So far I'm blown away. I know nothing about cameras and I've gotten some really good shots on the first try. Can't wait to see what it can do once I figure out all the features! Happy, happy.","Does everything it is supposed to do.  Simple to use, keeps the same logic as earlier cameras for which I am grateful - I didn't have to read instructions.  It is a little bigger and very slightly heavier, but clearly that is how they got the remarkable lenses into this small camera.  I have earlier versions that are the \"smaller and lighter\" that I refer to with 24X, and if that is all you need, go there.  I got this one for more flexibility for wildlife pictures and love it.","I love this camera.  Not only can I now take pictures of the moon at night but this camera is excellent in just about any photographic situation. It also does a great job at shooting video.  I'm finding myself using this camera more than any of my other cameras and I think that speaks volumes about it's versatility.","Very impressed with camera. Used it to combine my old Canon Rebel and a JVC video camera. Well photos are great at any of the Zoom distances. I use primarily to photograph the kids during sports, but now take it along so we can use it all the time. The video quality is also strong. It is not designed to be a video camera but I've been very impressed with the ease of use and final video. My son hates it cause now he has to watch himself after games","amazing pictures","I love this camera. The zoom is incredible, it has nice settings, viewfinder (which is getting hard to find nowadays) and even takes great video. It has lots of settings and RAW for beginning photographers but not enough for professionals. As a Mom who needs to take pictures from the stands, or no flash pictures while my kid is on stage, it is the perfect camera","Al what i wanted and more","Camera exceeded expectations!! I have been taking photos for a very long time, and this camera is the best I have ever owned. I'm yet to take a picture, up close or at a distance, that isn't crisp and rich in detail. EVF is amazing on sunny days! A worthy investment, whatever your level of photography, beginner or pro!!!","Great camera","nice camera for the bucks","Nice enough camera but was not apple friendly which is a big problem for me since all we have are apple products. The software that came with the camera was for pc only. You could get apple software but it was something you would have to purchase at the tune of over $200.00. So I returned it for the Canon sx 60 which has built in wifi. I am attaching two photo's of the same bird. The first one was taken with the lumix and the second with the Canon.","Amazing Zoom.  Leave power button on and battery drains.  Should have auto shut off.","wow Great zoom but ya need a tripod to keep it steady. And there is no remote cable for shutter so ya gotta use timer and this needs setting after each shot. the 2sec is too short for camera to stabilize so ya gotta use 10sec timer. for the money great zoom lotsa features, but i use only when i need big zoom cuz its a pain in the butt, so its one of several cameras i use.","Amature photographer here so I don't know a lot about cameras. To me this thing is amazing! What's more is the low price! Easy to use. Lots of options in the menu. Feels like quality material. Takes great photos!","Outstanding!!","I am very happy. the camera is very good","Fantastic camera. The only 'issue' is common to a lot of cameras these days. It's got so many 'smart' options sometimes it tries to take the picture 'it' thinks is better and I have to hunt around to find a more manual mode to get it to take the picture I want it to.<br /><br />It is a bit hard to take star-pictures because it keeps trying to either adjust my time to get more light or take pictures and average them.<br />But that's a limitation more of the slightly higher learning curve to really use this camera. The stability at full zoom is great, much better<br />than the Nikon, for example.<br /><br />The lens is awesome, If you wide angle, be careful. It will fish-eye if you angle 'up or down' too much. Also<br />the other thing that is a limitation of most cameras that offer a '3d' feature is the 3d is not very useful because it only works<br />at 'max wide angle view', meaning distant scenery, which really never has much depth. 3d up close with the differences in depth<br />is what I wanted, but it disables the 3d if you zoom in at all or if what you're looking at is fairly close. So the twin-lens cell phone<br />that does 3d actually takes better 3d pictures for close up stuff.<br /><br />Otherwise I love it. The ring mount is 55 mm so it's fairly easy to use existing lens adapters and filters or get a ring adapter for it.<br /><br />The camera battery life is great and with an inexpensive 32 gb card it takes a lot of pictures and a lot of video. The sound recording<br />is also very good.","good camera good seller.!","Excellent camera. Easy to use. Beautiful pictures. Have had a little more than a year.","Easy to use and takes great pictures.  I'll never be able to learn to use all of its features. Good battery life.","Never mind the zoom, the macro may work too good.  It sometimes focuses on the dust of a second filter (which screws directly on the lens).  When using maximum zoom, on this thing, it seems to do a little better then my Cannon EOS5D Mk2 w/100-400mm zoom at it's max. First picture shutter lag is almost institanious (a bit of a lag if a second picture is needed (non-burst)).  Main negative, no remote shutter possible.","A very nice camera for the money. It's lens and magnification were beyond my expectations. Its features are also impressive. Professional photographers I've shown it to were very impressed ... thought one was going to run off with it.","the zoom on this camera is astonishing. No need for \"macro\" -- just zoom in from a distance and get unbelievable detail and sharpness for even small items. User-friendly with lots of features.  I have owned more than 12 cameras and this one tops them all by a long shot -- literally and figuratively!","Yes, 60X zoom. Really! And if you lower your picture quality, meaning you do not take a 16M picture but set it to 5M or 3M, you get 135X zoom.<br />I took pictures of faces 300 feet away, clear and smooth.<br />It has a great anti-shake as well.<br />This camera can be used completely auto (for beginners) and completely Manual, completely! Shutter speed, ISO, F stop, everything manual.<br /><br />Only a few days old, mine is. I took about 100 pictures so far. IMPRESSIVE!<br /><br />The manual is simply worded, easy to understand. Nothing special explained but the on-board programming makes it idiot simple.<br />And the camera is completely fool-proof.<br /><br />So If I were you, get one. It is not even expensive. How to check it? Browse Amazon.com for 60X cameras and see.<br /><br />Anyway, I am completely pumped with this toy.","I am not a professional photographer so my knowledge of the function specifics of different camera models is limited, but as a photo hobbyist, here is my opinion on the Lumix FZ70...  Love this camera!  My old Lumix bit the dust after a LOT of use and so I upgraded to this newer model.  It's fabulous.  Has the point and shoot (intelligent auto) feature along with some manual capabilities...great for the hobbyist that isn't a professional photographer that knows all the technical aspects of shooting photos.  I like the creative options on this one as well.  I took a handheld close up of the moon (slight shake so it wasn't a clear as if I'd used a tripod) with the super zoom on this camera and was able to see craters in pretty good detail...kids thought that was pretty cool!  My photos have been consistently bright, clear and focused and the video is great too.  I would highly recommend this camera to someone who needs a reliable, quality camera to take photos of their kids, vacation, everyday things...can't speak to the professional capabilities.  :)","Purchased as a gift. Quick delivery and good price. All reports are good, the owner has been very happy with the photos so far.","exellent !!!","Really nice camera for the money.  Image is noisy over the 400 setting, but the zoom and the macro are excellent.","Great bridge camera with excellent zoom.<br />Good value and nearly as good as an SLR for quality of shots.<br />Burst mode works well when trying to catch shots of moving wild life.","works great -fast, high quality and reliable. great for outdoor pics of birds/animals/plants/landscapes. much better than the nikon i had before.","I bought this camera for my granddaughter because I  have used an older model for the last 4 years and  it still provides me with clear photos with fantastic colors. And the photos taken with this camera are just a great if not better than my old model. Plus this new model has an unbelievable zoom  that takes sharp photos.","This isn't going to be very helpful unfortunately as something about it bothered me but I can't remember what it was. Really wanted to love the super zoom but whatever the issue was irked me enough that I returned this and opted for the Fujifilm X30 instead and gave up on having a superzoom.","Very nice camera, not all the bells and whistles of my Sony which I had to replace, accidentally drove over it.  :(  But meets my needs well.  The shipper was excellent, no complaints.","Fun to use, seems fairly easy to learn","Excellent product and service","Loving this camera!! The Black Friday price was great and Amazon delivered it quickly. Lot of DSLR here for the price. Still learning what I can do with it but it has not let me down once in the 5 weeks I've had it!","Grainy photo when zoomed in","out standing camera at an excellent price","This is the second Panasonic DMC camera I purchased. I bought the DMC-FZ18 (8mp, 18X optical zoom) in 2007 and took some wonderful pictures with it. I love the EVF on both cameras.<br /><br /> I made the mistake of putting a different brand on my wish list. Hubby surprised me on Christmas day with the other brand. I played with it but  realized it was so so good as the Panasonic brand. The other brand was returned and I ordered the FZ70 for next day delivery.<br /><br />The other brand used 4 AA batteries that just didn't last.  Yes, there are rechargeable AA batteries I could purchase, but it's awkward carrying around multiple batteries like that. Two batteries had to be placed positive side up and two negative side up, but the diagram wasn't clearly marked under the battery door. The battery door felt flimsy and it was awkward to open. Lastly, I had trouble with the lens cap staying on the lens.<br /><br />I like how Panasonic compartments have a way to keep the lithium ion rechargeable battery pack locked into position when the door opens. The charger and the battery pack are compact and not cumbersome to use.  There is only one way the battery can be inserted because of its shape.<br /><br /> There are a lot more bells and whistles with the FZ70 but I don't plan to learn it all over night. I hope this digital camera lasts at least as long as the FZ18.","This is a review for the FZ70<br />I feel these are great cameras although, not so good for people who just want a point & shoot to do all of the thinking for them.<br /><br />Best tip: the easiest way to learn the camera is;  Go to youtube & search (Panasonic Lumix FZ200 Users Guide illustrated) by Graham Houghton. Watch some or all of the videos, study them, practice them. I have both cameras & most features are the same!(Note: You'll notice in Graham's very 1st video these features will be different on the FZ70.)=Most  features are the same, with the exception of these 5 different focus features;  Found on side lens on FZ200; these 4 are now found on back above the green play button on FZ70. After pressing this & a combination of pressing navigation & menu set buttons give you basically the same features. The 5th I'll call force focus button is found on top labeled focus.<br /> Graham's videos have helped many a lost user like me who hates using manuals to understand how to use the camera. I had to replay some videos several times but, still way easier than the download manual!  __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />  Comparing the 2 cameras these are the features I miss most<br /><br />1) The len's focus features mentioned above, I miss the manual focus rocker switch option on the FZ200. It is also one of the biggest trade offs of these cameras compared to a DSLR. No rotating lens manual focus. You have to (manual) focus by turning a dial, or using directional arrow buttons. note: fz70 has several auto focus options.<br /><br />2) (Huge) the FZ70 has no shutter release cable socket! This was a mistake Panasonic not including this feature!<br /><br />3) (Huge) the fixed LCD screen. I don't do selfies but, need for video pans on a tripod.<br /><br />4) (Hugh for me) = much, much, lower viewfinder clarity. I feel it is critical when doing manual focus to have the best viewfinder possible. However, the fz70 is the same as the Canon SX50  which cost $100 more. Nikon doesn't even post theirs for the 520 but seemed similar.<br /><br />5) 60p (i) video<br /><br />6) 16 megapixels crammed onto a 1/4\" censor; I wish it were only 12 megapixels like the FZ200. I have had no problems with the FZ200 showing pixelization squares.  I have read that this is bad to continually cram more & more pixels onto an already small sensor; but, it is the ever on going marketing battle/ trend. Panasonic claims 10 to 15% noise reduction but, I'm not convinced.<br /><br />6) To soon to tell about lens quality (the DC VARIO lens)<br />OOPS! This should have been #1 the constant aperture F2.8 but, the 70 is much less expensive so this is to be expected.<br /><br />7) No slow speed video option.  ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Things that FZ70 got right!<br /><br />1) the raised buttons, 100% easier to use. The video button is so hard to start & stop on the FZ200.<br /><br />2) The right side hand grip design; (Huge improvement!) If you own the fz200 you know what I mean.=bad design! I am always accidently turning on the white balance menu with the heel of my hand. So much so that I glued a plumbing washer around the 4 way navigation/ menu set button. This however makes it much harder to use the navigation buttons. So it was a trade off but, that is how crazy it made me; Accidently turning on the white balance menu all the time .<br /><br />3) The Zoom; what can I say! 20mm on the wide end to 1,200mm on the tel end. Even with the other flaws for just over $200  to be able to own that much range. I am not a professional so even if some blast it, calling it a toy. It would cost $800 to $1,300 for a cheaper slower 150mm to 600mm lens. Then about $800 for a cheaper DSLR and 2 lens kit to cover wide angle up to  150mm. And FZ70 takes great pictures. Plenty good for 1080p TV size pix. I will probably make more use from the wide end but, I do live in an area rich in big game wildlife & bald eagles. I can't wait for summer!<br /><br />So if Panasonic would combine all of these great feature on the same camera they'd have a super great camera. And one more suggestion Panasonic a vertical decision wheel to complement the horizontal decision wheel. This would be used instead of the arrow buttons for up & down. Are you listening Panasonic?<br />Using my newest designed Lumix with vertical & horizontal wheels + quick menu my eye would never leave the viewfinder except to walk.<br /><br />Hope this helps!","This is really a good camera. I bought it for my wife but I'll be using it also.","Great camera. Yes it does make a slight very tiny noise when you have it on that doesn't get noticed by any animal I've took a pic of but that is the awesome image stabilizer at work. Takes great videos too with good sound. Hard to beat for the money. Had this camera about a year. Starts up fast. Focuses fast. I took a pic of an ant at 60x zoom from about 7 feet away in focus. Great for the non professional. Macro close pics are great too.","this is one of the best cameras for a good low price.","This was a gift for my husband.  He absolutely loves it, and he's been a photographer for over 30 years.  This is his go-to camera now.","UPDATE:  February 8, 2015<br /><br />I returned the FZ70 and picked up the Canon SX60 HS. The difference is night and day. The SX60 is SO well worth the difference in price. All of the issues I complained about with the FZ70 are nonexistent in the SX60.  I'll be posting a separate review on it shortly.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST:<br /><br />I've had this camera for a total of 2 days so these are my first impressions.  All but three are great.  Two of those 3 are disappointments but not enough to make me regret my purchase.  The other, however, looks like a deal killer.  PANASONIC- TAKE NOTICE!<br /><br />First for the good:<br /><br />The camera's picture taking abilities are awesome, especially considering the price (I got it at a big box warehouse store with a bag and SD card included for $229- sorry Amazon).  The optics are clear and sharp enough to pass without extreme closeup inspection.  The zoom is great, too.  The 35mm equivalent of 20-1200mm is nothing to be sneazed at.  In daylight, the pictures are great throughout the entire range.<br /><br />The firmware is excellent as well.  There are enough presets to make anyone happy, and the manual settings allow you to tweak to your heart's desire.  I have to give the firmware an \"A\" for effort, too, because an early evening photo I took at full zoom was not so noisy as to be unpassable.  The details of a porch down the block were readable with the only light being a single, incandescent porch light.<br /><br />Now for the phenominal part:  the optical image stabilization. All the reviews for super zoom cameras like the FZ70 remind us that long-lens shots have to be taken with a tripod because the longer the lens, the more it amplifies movement.  As a rule, I can't argue.  And I know- I have a condition that makes me shake 24/7/365, except when I sleep (Not Parkinsons. Thanks for your concern :) ).  Well, I took a couple of handheld shots at full 1200mm zoom with the FZ70's optical IS on, and they are as if I was using a tripod!<br /><br />I don't know about other super-zooms like the Nikon, Canon, Kodak, etc.  I haven't given any of them a good test drive.  In comparison, however, to my Canon EOS DSLR with expensive IS lenses, it's like night and day.  To me, shooting with IS turned on at any focal length above 70mm is close to not having IS at all.  I didn't think it could be done.<br /><br />Now for the not so good and bad:<br /><br />I'm disappoiinted the camera doesn't have an articulating LCD screen like the Nikon, Canon and Leica super-zooms.  They are very handy for overhead shots.<br /><br />I'm also disappointed by the feel of the camera.  I almost didn't buy it specifically because it is made by Panasonic.  Back in the day, the Panasonic name in electronics was synonymous with junk.  [E.g., their stereos had high distortion, low signal-to-noise ratio and very limited frequency response because they used low cost electronic components, ceramic phono cartridges and turntables without bearings.] [They were second] only to GE [in the race for low quality] electronics.  Over the years I haven't seen anything to really change my mind, even after they came out with the Technics line to try to clean up their image.<br /><br />But this time I relented because of good reviews and a liberal 90 day return policy where I bought it.  As stated above, the camera [seems to] work great. But to me it feels like something less than substantial.  Something's off.  Maybe it's the balance, maybe it's the materials its made of.  It just doesn't scream \"quality\" to me.<br /><br />This is peculiar to me because according to dpReview, the FZ70 is heavier than the Nikon P600, Leica V-Lux 4, Kodak AZ651 and Canon SX50 (the SX60 is heavier).  Yet, when I pick up any of those lighter cameras, they feel more substantial.  They all scream out the sort of \"quality\" you'd expect from those brands.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if all else works well, the feel of the camera wouldn't compel me to return it.<br /><br />And now for the bad:<br /><br />THIS CAMERA DOES NOT HAVE REMOTE SHUTTER RELEASE CAPABILITIES!!!<br /><br />What was Panasonic thinking????  Remote shutter release, especially of the wireless kind, is a no-brainer for a long lense camera whose target market includes those who would use it for family photos.<br /><br />Moreover, when you shoot at long focal lengths on a tripod, the very LAST thing you want to do is touch the camera!  Even with Image Stabilization!<br /><br />Here's what I don't get- usually when a camera maker releases a new version of a camera model, it improved on the predecessor's qualities without diminishing the features.  Not Panasonic.  The FZ50 (the FZ70's predecessor) had a plug for a remote shutter release.  Obviously of the school of thought that says \"If it's not broken, break it,\" Panasonic decided to eliminate such a ridiculous frivolity like a remote shutter release.<br /><br />How stupid can a company be?  This, and this alone makes me think the same people who ran Panasonic in the 1970s and 80s still must be lurking in the background at Panasonic and calling the shots.  Time to retire, boys!  (I'm not a sexist; just the reality during that era.)<br /><br />So that's it.  I gave it three stars because I want to be fair to those out there who may not care about the remote shutter release issue.  If the camera's \"raison d'etre\" wasn't so stellar, I wouldn't hesitate to give it 1 star.<br /><br />I'll be shooting with it extensively next week to see if anything will change my mind.  But as it stands, the shutter release issue is a deal killer for me and I'll be returning it for another brand that has what I want and need.  Maybe newer models will be out by then.  I'll update if anything changes.<br /><br />Happy New Year!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------<br /><br />FOLLOW UP Dec 29, 2014<br /><br />I spent the past week shooting hundreds of pictures of all kinds with the FZ70. The camera did not redeem itself to me. In fact, I was hasty in being so enthusiastic about it in my initial review.  Below are my findings.<br /><br />1.  Optical quality:  (1)  Wide to medium wide shots are ok but not spectacular when compared to Nikon and Canon at same settings.  But the camera really let me down on the long shots.  No matter how I set it, long shots lacked the detail and focus of the Canon and Nikon.<br />(2)  Lens flare is excessive and unacceptible. I couldn't get a decent picture of a crescent moon without a flare to accompany it. (3) I question Panasonic's claim that its lens is the equivalent to a 1200mm lens on a 35mm camera. Sitting next to a friend using a Nikon with 400mm lens, the image on his camera was slightly larger, more detailed and noticeably less noisy than the FZ70 at 60x on the same subject. (See 3(3), below)<br /><br />2.  Viewfinder:  Both the viewfinder and LCD screen are low res. So you can't really tell how good the pictures are (or aren't) until they are downloaded and viewed on a hi res screen.  (I viewed my pictures on a 2560 x 1440 monitor before writing this review.)<br /><br />3.  Firmware:  (1) Daytime long shots were noisy, as were twilight and night shots (perhaps the latter is to be expected).  (2) Automatic settings were unsatisfactory.  E.g., (a) Automatic white balance- I nearly lost a magnificent sunset because the automatic white balance was so off.  Even when I went to manual, no matter what I did I still could not capture the colors of that sunset.  Moreover, all low-light pictures were predominantly red no matter how I set the camera; (b) Automatic focus was deathly slow and tentative, any time of day, any focus method.  (c) Automatic exposure levels were inaccurate for night shots. When I shot a picture of downtown Puerto Vallarta at night from across the bay (the kind of picture of which I've taken, literally, thousands), the white lights were washed out and over exposed.  Even when I bracketed +/- 1 and +/-3, the same happened.  I could not get an evenly balanced night shot of city lights regardless of focus method. (3) The camera does not record the focal length setting so you will not be able to replicate a shot at a later time or compare it to another camera at the same settings. (By design? I wonder. See 2(2), above.)<br /><br />4.  Ease of use:  (1) Nearly every function had to be accessed through the numerous-page menu system.  There was no way to jump from one setting to another or even one page to another without scrolling through all settings in between.  This may or may not be the same as Canon and Nikon, but it bugs me.  If C & N are the same, they will bug me, too.<br /><br />5.  Burst mode:  For all intents and purposes, there is no burst mode with autofocus.  The most I could get was 3 frames at a time.  The real downside is that in anything but manual focus jpg mode, the viewfinder goes dark during the entire shooting sequence so you can't see where any frames other than the first are pointed.<br /><br />6.  Raw mode:  This same phenomenon of viewfinder blackout occurs when shooting raw images.  Until the image is loaded onto the SD card, you can't frame the next shot.<br /><br />7.  Missing features:  These are features that I miss and would like to have that are available in the Nikon, Canon, Leica, etc. cameras:  (1) slow motion; (2) faster 1080p frame rates; (3)  As mentioned in my first review, THERE'S NO REMOTE SHUTTER RELEASE ABILITY WHATSOEVER (no, using self timer is not any kind of substitute for the real thing- the very act of pressing the button at full zoom can move the subject completely out of view, and if shooting something that moves, even slowly like the moon, it will move out of frame during the 2-10 seconds it takes for the shutter to release.); and (4) See 3(3), above.<br /><br />8.  Hot Shoe:  Add on flashes are great for things like naturally eliminating red-eye and more distant flash shots.  Like Canon and Nikon, Panasonic has a hot shoe for such a flash.  And like Canon and Nikon, its layout is proprietary.  So, unlike Canon and Nikon, there are scant few after-market flash manufacturers who cater to Panasonic, and you certainly can't walk into a brick-and-mortar store and find an after-market Panasonic flash.  So if you have a Lumix camera, you may be relegated to using an enormously over-priced Panasonic brand flash.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />You get what you pay for. This particular Panasonic Lumix camera is nothing more than a Canon/Nikon wannabe. It remains foolhardy to believe you will get a camera of Nikon or Canon quality for $100-200 less.<br /><br />There remain pros.  I still think the image stabalization is great, but I can't say it's any better than Canon's and Nikon's.  But the cons outweigh them to me.<br /><br />If a camera with the features and qualities I've described is ok with you, then go ahead and get it.  It's an ok camera and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />But if you have higher expectations of a camera that purports to compete with the Nikons and Canons of the world, I suggest you pass it up.<br /><br />Some might think Panasonic is trying to pull the wool over some buyers' eyes by making a sheep in wolf's clothing.  I don't attribute such machinations to the company.<br /><br />However, if a wolf at all, it is still a pup.  I do think it fills a market niche for a low priced super-zoom.  At the same time, I also think Panasonic has no intention of losing money by selling it at a lower price point without cutting corners here and there.<br /><br />So users that are not as sophisticated as Nikon and Canon buyers, who likely make up the vast majority of camera buyers, may find this camera suitable for their needs. (Forgive me if my description of such buyers is ineligant.  I mean no disrespect.)<br /><br />I just can't see how so many respected sites like dpReview.com have given this model such great reviews. Maybe it's good in laboratory settings but not in the real world. Maybe Panasonic provided them with specially tuned machines.<br /><br />So, alas, this camera will be returned and replaced by a Canon SX60.  I gave the FZ70 a fair shot.  I would have loved a camera that can give me Canon quality photos at a major savings.  Unfortunately, it just affirms the cliche.  So I'll shell out the extra dough and get a Canon SX60.<br /><br />I will be so disappointed, however, if the undoubtedly soon-to-be-released FZ80 addresses all of my issues and still comes in at $100 less than the others!<br /><br />PS.  When did \"depth of field\" become \"background defocusing?\"","I purchased this camera for myself a little over a month ago. I use the camera around the house to take pictures of the wildlife and family events. It does a great job. It's not as light weight as a point and shoot you can stick in your pocket but it's not heavy either. I have small hands and it feels comfortable in my hands while I am using it. My husband has larger hand and it also feels comfortable when he is holding it. It takes great pictures, although I tend to shake a bit so my zoomed in pictures were blurry. I solved this by purchasing a folding Monopod which keeps the camera still while i am using the 60x zoom. It's easy to use. I was playing around with it after I read the instruction booklet and it has many great features. You can use an automatic setting and just click away or you can adjust and use more manual settings.One of the many selling points for me was the rechargeable battery. It is just a personal preference. I  don't like having to carry around a bunch of AA batteries. Amazon also sells additional rechargeable batteries for this camera. How can you go wrong, and you would have enough battery power to last quite awhile.Would I recommend this camera? Already have and would do so if anyone else asks me about it. For a casual user everyday user like myself or someone going on vacationit's a great camera","So pleased with my purchase! It is a great camera and gets beautiful photographs!!","Simply a wonderful camera for enthusiasts. TWO great big drawbacks: the microphone is very poorly located. The tendency is to place your left index finger at the microphone location to achieve best purchase. This, of course, blocks your voice while using the video function. While shooting sports or fast action subjects one is more interested in capturing the action, not thinking about microphone location. The second irritating point is the non-articulating LCD. Goodbye selfless and the ability to thwart sunlight by rotating the LCD.<br />I do have high hopes that Panasonic will correct this in up-coming versions. Great camera otherwise! I give this camera 4 stars.","This camera is perfect for traveling. I traveled to Paris and London. Their palaces, towels, castles, and buildings are huge size, and everywhere is people. I stand far away from the crowded people and zoom in the scene. I got photos with the huge buildings and my family members only. Other travelers cannot bother me.","Like the camera but it is a little difficult to learn to operate correctly. Still working with it but I was a former Panasonic simple camera user and wanted better quality photos. I think that it will be fantastic with more practice.","Wonderful camera! Beautiful zoom and versatility!","It has so many features it is great","Wonderful, powerful, feature-rich camera. Another Panasonic masterpiece.","Bought this on Black Friday and got a good deal, but not impressed. Save your money and go up to an entry level DSLR. Took some good photos, but video quality not so good. I bought this thinking I could find a decent happy medium of photo and video, but I know in this price range you truly get what you pay for.","The photos are sharp and clear.  A major drawback with this and many similar cameras it the obscuring the view when the picture is taken eliminating the ability to follow an object that is not stationary thus denying other opportunities.","Uses it almost every day for photo sessions indoors and out. Excellent camera.","Great stuff. Consider getting a Card Reader too for editing the MP4 Video. The Lens if nifty:)","I really was expecting more from this camera. Just received today and tested indoor. looks like my old Olympus Tough TG 820 but bigger. I bought the Olympus Tough TG 830 And i was really disappointed of his quality, nothing compare to the old one TG820.<br />Dont get me wrong the camera is not bad but Iwas looking for something better more sharp. Maybe because is made in China.","Very nice.  Well worth the money.","WooCommerce","Excellent","Great camera. The zoom is amazing however it is difficult to keep it steady sometimes.","Love this camera!  I got tired of trying to take pictures in bright light and not being able to see what I was shooting on LCD screens.  I wanted a camera with a regular viewfinder and this one fits the bill without breaking the bank.  All the other capabilities are just icing on the cake and I'm having fun learning what this camera will do.","One great camera -- especially for the price.","I am satisfied with this camera in any aspect of performance.","Actually, my husband purchased this camera. He is in LOVE with it! Great camera for the price and zoomed-in pictures are AMAZING. He raved about it so much that our friend purchased the same camera.","This has the greatest zoom length of any smaller camera.  Excellent value for the price.  Any Panasonic Lumix camera is above average but this is one of the better ones.","This camera is amazing! Beautiful pictures! Great zoom!!!","ITEM NOT SENT ASAP AS STATED ON WEB SITE","Great camera!","Got this camera for the wildlife where I'm  working.Shoots video up to an amazing 300x in great detail! Reduce the picture size to 5m (8x10 photo)zoom up to 540x! I've had little to any noise at 540x! Takes decent night shots. Battery life was about 2 days. Haven't used the new Canon sx60 but why pay another 150 dollars? Have sent several pictures to weatherbug.com there published on there photo site.","This has been a great little camera.  I bought it to see how much I would actually use a camera and if it would be worthwhile to get a nice DLSR.  I've used this quite a bit and am shocked sometimes just how nice the pictures are.  I love night pictures such as skylines of my hometown (Kansas City), and although this camera has a much smaller sensor than a DLSR, I get pretty good results with a tripod.  I'm sure not as good as a DLSR, but I've been pretty impressed.<br /><br />I've tried driving out into the country and taking pictures of the Milky Way, but it's just not up to that.  Day photos look amazing.<br /><br />I've had this for about a year now, and never did upgrade to a DLSR.  If you're just someone who is going to play around with it it's a great camera.","First:  ALL cameras are a compromise.  You can buy a Canon EOS Rebel with an 18mm-55mm lens for $500. and Canon's new 1200mm lens cost is $158,000. and a Samyang 12mm wide angle lens another $350. So the mega zooms are a compromise unless you have $159,000. hanging around.  This camera replaces my Canon SX40HS which goes from 24mm to 840mm.  All mega zoom cameras have to use a small sensor so they all suffer in low light and picture quality also suffers. I judge the picture quality of the FZ70 to be about the same as the Canon SX40HS.  This camera feels good like a DSLR camera.  Too bad no flip out LCD screen but it works.  I purchased a 55mm to 67mm step up adapter so I could use filters from the Canon.  With a tulip lens hood no vignetting at 20mm.  I am glad I bought this camera rather than Canon, Nikon or Sony.","I'll be honest; I don't know anything about cameras and I'm too lazy to take a two year class on taking pictures of my kids...or a flower.  I just wanted something that would take nice photographs from far away, action shots, and general photo taking.  This camera does all of that very easily.<br /><br />I got tired of going to my kids' school functions with just a 4x zoom camera (or my cell phone) only to get THE WORST PICTURES POSSIBLE!  My oldest son had this graduation ceremony from fifth grade.  I was 200ft away.  They were too far away and the picutres I took closer were so blurry they were unusable.<br /><br />With this camera, those days are over!  You can zoom in from so far away it's ridiculous!  The nice thing is that they don't seem to lose too much picture quality, either.  The picture quality is fantastic!  I will say this; if you zoom all the way out (or close to it) it gets a little shaky.  You can still take the shot but you might want to use a tripod or brace it on something.<br /><br />Other than that, pictures come out vibrant and crystal clear, even with kids running at full steam.<br /><br />I am very happy with this product.  I attached two photos.  The first one is pointed at the moon with no zoom.  The second one was at full zoom.  I had to use a tripod for the second one.","Great deal on a great camera!  The optical zoom on this camera is terrific.  I love not having to carry various lenses around.  Solidly built and has performed without any problems.","Love this camera","This is a comparative review of this camera vs Nikon Coolpix P600<br /><br />Per initial testing its a mixed bag.<br /><br />The Nikon Advantages: When it comes to manual focus it<br /><br />definitely wins with a nice focus assist overlay that displays some<br /><br />white edges when the object is focused - seems great for a camera<br /><br />at this price range.<br /><br />I do love its full tilt display - that is very useful for taking selfie<br /><br />shots and other object closeups that will not be possible<br /><br />otherwise due to tough angles.<br /><br />It has wifi that can easily let you transmit pictures to your smart<br /><br />phone and tablet.<br /><br />Maybe able to charge from a computer or other sufficient power<br /><br />USB chargers.<br /><br />Disadvantages:<br /><br />The Nikon Coolpix P600 on the other hand only goes up to 7 fps<br /><br />(per manual) and after you shoot the camera \"freezes\" for<br /><br />processing which takes several seconds to process (at least 3-5<br /><br />full seconds) - I find this to make the camera nearly useless to<br /><br />shoot say sporting events or animals in motion.<br /><br />No hot shoe for external flash<br /><br />Shorter range flash<br /><br />Less buttons and more nested menu options - harder to operate<br /><br />(coming from Canon cameras) - it seems not logical to me and I<br /><br />did need to refer to the manual for some features.<br />Charging it is a bit odd for this level of camera - the charger is<br /><br />basically a USB cable that plugs directly in to the camera.  So you<br /><br />can not charge a spare battery without the camera.<br /><br />Maybe they sell a separate charger for that purpose.<br /><br />The key advantage the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 has so far - is<br /><br />fast processing of busrt shooting.<br /><br />Basically you can do up to about 9 fps on it and after you shoot<br /><br />there is a reasonable delay of say about maybe 1 second for<br /><br />processing<br /><br />It has a hot shoe for external flash<br /><br />Longer built-in flash range<br /><br />More buttons and easier to operate (coming from Canon cameras)<br /><br />- it seems logical to me and didn't need to refer to the manual<br /><br />much.<br /><br />Disadvantages - not as good for manual focusing.<br /><br />It has a fixed display - old school and not a functional as the<br /><br />Nikon.<br /><br />Hope this helps you make a decision.<br /><br />My 3 cents,<br /><br />Michael Raveh<br />Technology Specialist @<br />MIR Information Technology, Inc.","The reason I gave this 4 stars is that this is a great little camera for those who want to move into the more advanced photography than allowed by the simple point and shoot ones.  It takes wonderfully sharp pictures and has an easy override for the exposure.  It has quite a number of photographical effects that would take large camera bag filled with filers and gadgets to accomplish in a film camera.  The viewfinder is a lot more comfortable in taking pictures than the screen at the back of the camera which is prone the washing out in bright light.  One feature I especially like is the ability to set the view finder so that it is overlaid with a horizontal and vertical lined grid.  This not only helps with composition but also for aligning vertical structures for architectural photography and also keeping the horizon level.  I have nearly the same view screen in two of my three film SLR’s<br /><br />A minor complaint I have is that the camera lens reverts most wide angle zoom mode when first turned on.  I would prefer it to start with a more normal view of around 3x to 4x zoom.  It has a lens resume option, but that takes it back to the zoom position last used when the camera was turned on.<br /><br />A not so minor problem is that it takes nearly three hands to plug the mini USB adapter into the camera.  One to hold the black camera, one to hold open the little black access door, and one to insert the little black mini adapter into the black opening of the black camera.  Night vision glasses and a third hand could be very useful.","It can do amazing things.  The wide angle is excellent.  It's the most versatile camera I ever bought for anywhere near this price.","Thanks! -Love the camera.Our misunderstanding on the delivery was completely the fault of the hotel we had the camera sent to who couldn't find it !!<br />Thanks again -very happy with my purchase.","very nice camera with great zoom. I can zoom in on a deer on the next hillside.","This is an amazing camera! It has the range of my 300mm Canon lens with 1.4 extender and more MPs than my Canon 7D and weighs about 4 pounds less than that combination. I have trouble focusing at full zoom and close distances, and no idea what the problem is, but it's probably my not understanding something. Basically, despite my ignorance of all things camera, am getting excellent pictures of difficult subjects. I especially like the way it will take pictures in the dark with the flash disabled, lighting by some other means that doesn't seem to bother octopuses and other light-sensitive creatures.","This camera is amazing!  I am not a professional photographer - just someone who loves to take pictures.  The camera is easy to use, and the zoom is phenomenal.  I actually captured the sun spots on the partial solar eclipse as a seagull flew across the sun. The attached photo is a still from a video that I took.","Not too bad. I don't like how part of the camera case shows up when zoomed out all the way. Photos are a bit blurry around the edges. It's just ok.","ok","I was impressed with the versatility of the camera.  Good HD video quality, which was my primary reason for purchase.  Acceptable lens resolution for a lens that covers the 60x zoom range - it covers 35mm equiv. focal lengths from 20mm to 1200mm - it's unusual to see such a wide angle with a long zoom.  Battery life is good.","Nice balance, not too heavy. Zoom is incredible!!! Sorry I didn't buy this sooner. Just came back from a trip where I realized just how out of date my camera was. Hope there'll be many trips ahead.  Would have liked WiFi capability, but exceptional value for the price.","I love this camera with its record 60x zoom - takes some practice using the zoom.<br />Nicely priced for its attributes.","Good Price, Do not have to carry extra lens, easy to use.","This is a great camera for the price!  It can zoom up to 120x!  I've gotten EXTREME close up photo's with this, that came out amazingly clear!  I have a photo of the moon that fills the entire frame, and it's almost perfectly clear!  I would recommend this camera for any hobbiest photographer.  It has it's own little editing program built in, to make photo's look better.  The battery life is good, and the feel of the camera is good.  The lens does not come off, but you can add filters, a hood, and a telephoto lens built for this camera on it.  Highly recommend.","Nice... more powerful sensor and a much improved method of shooting hand-held evening and night pictures. I am pleased with the incresased magnification and steady zoom approach. I haven't figured out the movie section yet, but so far, it's a solid step uP!","I have had this now for 1/2 a year.  So far this has been a great camera.  The zoom is unbelievable.  I have been using this recently to take football pictures of my son playing on Friday night.  It takes great zoom pictures of the play on the field.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.  Before buying, I had considered buying a much more expensive SLR camera with multiple lenses to accommodate the zoom I wanted.  I am happy I didn't spend all the extra money.","Well...I can't wait to upload some pictures I bought because with the 3D feature, the possibilities are endless and you don't have to be a \"rocket scientist\" to figure the gizmo out. I'm a Writeographer and the 60X zoom is the reason I went the Lumix route, without paying an \"arm and a leg\"! I'm a major budgeter and with my hubby retiring at 53, taking pictures to me is very important right now to look back on in our prime. Why pay $$500 on up for camera's because of the \"brand\" name or because it has more features than one could even use with knowhow. I love it so far and it's only been a week....will let ya know if this glee lasts. To me, nothing is any good if it doesn't go at least 3 years electronically minus any headache malfunctions:-)","I just bought this camera in refurbished condition and it came just like new! This is a great camera with awesome price and incredible zoom!","The camera is great! Getting great telephoto shots and wide angles too. My only wish is that it had a Leica lens like my other Lumix cameras. Some people say it doesn't matter but I think it does.","So far it meets my expectations.  Thanks Amazon for easy exchange and prompt shipping.","Wow!","Excelente producto","This camera is a bit bulky and does not feel as solid as I thought it would.  While it takes a great picture, for me it was like having to go back to school.  I went on line to get the manual because the hard copy that came with the camera had two problems.  The print size was too small to casually refer to it...and there are all kinds of signs that I did not understand and there is no glossery.  So that made it difficult for me to figure out what I needed to do in different situations.  It also means that if I am out and have a question, I would have to be near MY computer where the manual is stored.  If I had a choice at this point...I would have gotten a Cannon!!!  But this Panasonic is acceptable.  I had no problems with delivery etc.","Even though I had an older model of the Lumix Camera, which I just loved, after it broke I decided to purchase this newer model for my main camera. After being able to use it right away I knew it would be a great camera to take on my vacation. So far I love the newer features on this camera!!1","I bought this for a trip to see my baby daughter.  I put over 1000 pics on it on one battery charge, and still havent had to change the sd card. I also go video and used the long distance lense quite a bit.  I would say its definitely worth the money.  It may be a little clunky for some.","This camera is just what a I needed. The zoom is incredible. The auto features make it great for beginners. Great bang for the buck.","it's a great bridge camera.  works well and for me it's perfect, i can get extra lenses to put on it like a UV or CPL and others.  it's a standard 55mm so they are easy to find.  the pic quality is excellent.  just wish is was a higher Megapixel but i couldn't afford that.  this is a great camera for the money.  and it's fast.  ready to shoot as fast as you turn it on.","Best bang for the buck that you're going to find anywhere from any brand.  $299 for everything that a $400-$500 camera does?  What a deal.  This is known as a Bridge model camera because it bridges the gap between a Point & Shoot (with very little to no features) and the dSLR world where you find all the bells and whistles.  This is everything that a dSLR is, except it has a smaller sensor (not that awfully important to most users), the LCD screen doesn't move and stays flat on the camera body, and the lens is permanently attached.<br /><br />If you've been wanting to leave the simplicity of just pushing one button and actually learn photography, this is undoubtedly the best path to go because of the price and full blown features.  It shoots in JPG and/or RAW (pro feature).  It has facial recognition.  It can be used in automatic, aperture priority, shutter priority, or full manual modes. It does scene modes, shoots 1080p movies, the auto focus is fast and accurate, and Panasonic image stabilization is one of the finest on the market.  It has stereo sound from two built-in mics and an input for a stereo external mic.  Flash hot shoe is rare at this price range too.  It does in-camera HDR if you like.  The 60X lens is one of the longest you can get and it has an \"intelligent\" zoom mode that will let you reach 120X before you see image deterioration.  I'm sure it also uses Leica-quality glass which is top notch.  Even then it has a digital zoom beyond that for even more zoom length although I refuse to use digital zoom.<br /><br />All in all, this camera will just plain knock you out for the price. I blew it in September 2014 when Panasonic had this camera for $249 with free shipping as a one weekend special.  You might watch for that or just buy it from Amazon at $299 because $299 is still a steal for everything this camera can do.  You won't be sorry.","I have a wonderful Nikon DSLR but wanted a portable camera with a long lens. The camera does an infinite amount of tricks and the zoom is just incredible. I have received so many comments on the moon photos I've posted on Facebook. I actually took a HAND HELD 1200mm shot of the moon and it came out perfectly. A tripod would would make that particular job easier, but I still got a great shot. Dollar for dollar, this is the most rewarding $300 I have ever spent.","this is such a fun camera to play with!  and the battery really lasts a lot longer than most.  I love the feel of the camera due to the grip on the right side.","Fabulous camera!","Best camera I've ever owned. Awesome zoom and the absolute clearest, crisp pictures you will ever take.","I am a little disappointed in the zoom.  It is powerful but not as sharp as I would like.  The camera is loaded with features.  I have an older Lumix, 12MP, 24X zoom that I love.  The DMC-FZ70 is very light and on the small side but larger than my older camera.  It can be challenging to hold it steady.  I thought I would give this one a try.  I don't know if I will keep it.<br /><br />Update on my review:  I was taking some photos of shorebirds and taking multiple exposures.  I took maybe 8 photos and the camera went into a \"busy\" mode for forty minutes.  I literally could not do anything with it.  This has happened twice.  It seems to take some great photos and then some very poor photos in terms of sharpness.  I don't understand why.  I've read the manual which is skimpy and put the manual on my iPad but this is not convenient.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad copy as it is called.  The camera will be returned.","I recieved the product on time and excellent condition. Why shouldn't it be ? Brand new. My only hangup about the camera....and it's a nitpick really...is the zoom. It's great...but I miss the way zoom is used on the SLR cameras like canon and nikon. The 1080 HD video is really impressive. I was a bit shocked at the clarity and not to mention the audio quality.","Great Camera.","This is a fantastic camera. I have used it for several weeks/months and it keeps surprising me with new and exciting options. The 60 X optical zoom is fantastic. I can hand hold at max zoom, but it does work best with a monopod or tripod. You will be glad you chose this camera.","This is an excellent camera for the price with great functionality.  It does take some getting use to its operation, but once mastered gives outstanding photos.  I took this with me on a trip to Africa.  It took incredible closeup shots using the telephoto function.  Other people were carrying their $1,000 cameras that weighed 3 times what this camera weighs.  But their photos were not noticeable better.  I recommend this camera to any budgete conscious individual looking for a great buy.","Nice zoom, contrast, panoramic option... Beautiful and really good.","I am in the \"how to\" part yet, but just did my first work with video with this and it's incredible even in low light escenes. Great pictures but I think that there's some kind of too much noise on them, but still great. Amazing videos at 60 fps and the zoom is just crazy with its 60x. It has some features that will blow your creativity away. Sometimes I love the wide angle lens and other times hate it, but in general it is an excellent camera to work with.","great for vacations, great zoom","LOVE IT, love it. The pictures are great. The controls are not as easy as the Pentax that I returned before buying this, but the picture quality is better the zoom lens is astonishing! The only drawback is the manual. The one provided with the camera is scant on information, enough to get the owner up and running,but not much else. I needed more detail. A manual comes on the cd to be downloaded and then printed if desired, however, I could not get it to print. I wound up ordering the manual from a third party, so now I have the manual that should have come with the camera in the first place. Who in the world is going to carry a computer around all over the place so that he or she can refer to it while getting accustomed to the camera. Not me, that is for sure. Great camera and seems to be well built and sturdy also. I hightly recommend this camera.","I've had this camera for only three days. I've taken over a thousand photos and cant believe what a great camera it is. It takes fantastic photos. The zoom is incredible, There are so many features that it's mind boggling.. well maybe me being 70 has something to do with that boggled mind.. I have a few cameras and one is a Nikon d3200 with 4 lenses and a gazillion attachments and assorted gizmos.. I wish I had bought this one first. It does everything the Nikon does and more and only weighs a fraction of the Nikon. For the price of this camera you cant go wrong. Enjoy.","This is an amazing camera.....I've had it for about a month, and have spent a lot of that time learning some of the features and capabilities. The FZ70 is an upgrade for me, having had an FZ40 previously.  Because I never spent much time trying to learn all the features of the FZ40, this camera is almost a whole new experience. Be aware that the manual is not very clear on a lot of the functions of this camera, but there are other sources online for help.<br />The images (those taken correctly) are clear, and the 60X zoom is fantastic. Some reviewers have stated that image quality is not very good when utilizing the ultra zoom, but I think you will find that with any large zoom if you don't use a tripod.<br />All in all, I think I will enjoy this camera - even more so after I master all of its functions.  My one disappointment is that the price has dropped considerably since I purchased it last month.","Absolutely Perfect Transaction !!!","The challenge for this camera like most bridge cameras with small sensors is image quality, especially  because of its phenomenal zoom range which can be increased even further with reduced pixelization. But, with this camera, contrary to the implied suggestion of most \"professional\" reviewers, there is much you can do to seriously increase image quality and have your camera pull well ahead of other super zooms, It is done both by camera settings and technique. Additionally, by processing, if you chose to go that far. You will need to work hard in order to achieve superior results full of color, sharpness, contrast and low noise, but it is doable even without RAW processing, notwithstanding the stunning wide to telephoto zoom range. To accomplish this, work carefully with the camera settings, pay close attention to get the optimal exposure, keep the ISO down, get the \"hang\" of the stabilization system, use spot focusing and area selection, and then use a tripod, monopod or brace like a shooter as I do. Finally, to do even more, shoot RAW and in processing go after sharpness and noise reduction, perhaps with an add-on noise reduction program like Topaz which plugs into Lightroom. The results from doing these things vs not and just snapping your shots are simply huge and stunning -- night vs. day. Just a word to the wise, if image quality is your real concern.<br /><br />Update 9/15/14 to my last comment<br />For objects in shade/overcast, I use \"Vivid\" +1 contrast, +1 sharpness, 0 saturation, -2 noise reduction. For objects in bright sunlight or bright enough and nearer by, I use \"Natural\" -1 contrast, -1 sharpness, -1 saturation and -2 noise reduction. I switch between the two using the F2 button by having the Vivid settings stored as a custom setting and the Natural settings as the way the camera is set up. Pushing two buttons gets me back and forth quickly. Still playing with the settings, but these are pretty ballpark.","I have more than 30 years as an amateur photographer. From my first days in the 35 mm field I was married with Olympus. I still remember the fantastic OM-1 and my last OM-2. Since the introduction of digital cameras I have had some experiences with the small point and shoot cameras mainly from Panasonic. This were very good cameras but nothing like the professional Olympus system.<br /><br />Based a lot on the reviews, I bought the DMC-FZ70 with a lot of expectations. Now I have to say that all of them were fulfilled with this amazing camera. With it, I can make anything I made before with my old 35mm Olympus and much more. The most impressive thing is the long focus 60x range . No need of interchangeable zoom lenses. With just one lense you can make all the range from a wide angle to large tele.<br /><br />In addition it offers adjustments for deep of field, color temperature (with no need of filters), selective focus, image contrast, etc. There is a lot of technology behind this small and light camera that fits anywhere in your baggage.<br /><br />The Lumix lense at f 2.8 is incredible luminous. With a firm hand (or a tripod) there is no need of flash during normal night conditions.<br /><br />Other things from the digital era are new to me but I love them as the suggestions from the machine for beautiful sunsets, creative effects and much more.<br /><br />The only thing I miss is the absence of leather case tailor made for this camera as I had for my old Olympus.<br /><br />I am not a professional but I will recommend this camera for any amateur who wants a quality systems at much lower prices than most renowned ones.","Had this less than a month. Had a dmc-fz10 before.  Very nice update.  Clear pictures, easy to use. Did take me some time to work out how to adjust manual exposure and such. The printed manual is very basic but finding some of the settings on the camera is not.  Amazing lens stabilization. I have a hand tremor and can still shoot at full zoom.  From macro to full tele, range is great and picture quality only limited by my talent, or lack thereof, as a photographer.  I don't want to have to haul around multiple lenses, but want to do most of what a full DSLR can do so this is an ideal camera. I'm not sure what the advantage would be of a DSLR.  I got a refurbished one for just over $200, and at that price it was well worth it. Not sure if would have paid full new retail price but even that is cheaper than decent DSLR.  Time will tell as to how it holds up. My old fz10 is still taking great pictures, 10 years on and I expect the same from this one.","So far I love it. I am taking very nice pictures, even though I have very little knowledge of photography. The zoom is absolutely amazing.","So far I really like the camera . Bought it as a refurbished unit but I have taken several hundred shots with it with no problems yet. I do wish they had an intervalometer setting for time lapse photo shoots though. The 60x zoom lens is great for moon shots .","THIS CAMERA IS REALLY AWESOME, I JUST CAME BACK FROM VACATION TO OREGON, AND IT TOOK GREAT PICTURES OUT TO ABOUT 1500 METERS. I USED THE AUTO SETTING  AND IT DOES A WONDERFUL JOB OF SETTING THE CAMERA UP FOR PICTURES.","Ok","Love the camera - took some great shots of the moon and moon lit shots (with the moon in the back ground) look<br />almost like they were taken in day light.  Also easy to use when set on automatic.  Takes super video.<br /><br />Hate the instruction manual - first have to download it into a computer so unless you take your computer with you,<br />the manual is not available.  When seeking some information, the page referenced in the contents refers to another<br />page, which refers to another, then another, then back to the original page.  Of course, what you need to know is<br />difficult, at best, to find.<br /><br />Like I said, great camera if you can figure out how to use all its features.","The zoom range on this camera is unbelievable.  The base camera has a 60X zoom range making it the longest of any camera available at the moment. The total zoom range in mm is 20 - 1200 mm which is very impressive. Standard SLR lenses with those types of ranges would require several lenses and untold thousands of dollars......plus the cost of the camera itself. Yet this Lumix jewel accomplishes all that and more at a scant fraction of the cost. The camera is easy to operate, has an incredible amount of built in features and much more just waiting to be discovered by experimenting.  An added bonus is the ability to extend the zoom range by selecting image resolutions less than the full 16.1M.  While there are those who will always want to shoot at 16.1M for me it is overkill.  Image resolution is a subjective issue. It is simply a matter of what you want to believe and are willing to settle for. I currently use a Sony DSLR compact camera like this Lumix, a Nikon D50 with several lenses but usually coupled with a Tamron 18 - 200. This D50 is a 6.1M camera and I have shot and enlarged flawless prints at 11 x 14 with total clarity. Some may take issue with this statement but excessive megapixels in a camera is much like owning a car that will run 150 mph when all you can go on the highway is 55 mph.  The capacity is there..........but when, if ever are you going to utilize it.  Now, if you are a professional photographer or a serious amateur and routinely enlarge to 16 x 20 or even 20 x 30 or more.....that is one thing. But if your basic need is for standard 4 x 6 prints and an occasional 5 x 7 or even an 8 x 10 then your eye will be hard pressed (if even able to) discern any difference between a 5M photo and a 16M photo.<br /><br />I said all that to say this........one of the great features of this camera is the ability to increase the zoom range by selecting less than 16.1M resolution. I have taken it down all the way to 5M, still get crystal clear pictures and this increases the zoom range from 60X all the way to 270X!  Yes, you read correctly!!!  Then.....if you add the digital zoom you can end up with a total on camera zoom range of 675X.  Have you ever heard of anything like this?  Then for fun and games I took a Sony brand teleconvertor for my Sony that is rated for 1.7X and mounted it to my Lumix.  The standard filter size for the Lumix is 55mm but I had bought a Goja filter adaptor ring in order to be able to use my several hundred dollars worth of existing filters. Many of them are 58mm so I simply bought a Goja 55mm to 58mm adaptor ring and viola......instant filter availability. AND.....it just so happens that my Sony teleconvertor has 58mm threads and I was able to couple this right to my Lumix, which now takes the 675X max zoom of the camera with izoom and digital zoom, multiples it by 1.7 and now gives a total zoom range of 1147X.  That is NOT 1147 mm.............it is 1147X zoom range.<br /><br />Now.......I will admit, the camera is a bear to use in a hand held mode, but that is just what I did to see worse case scenario. I am going to post a couple of pictures taken hand held at these extremes so you can just see the potential this camera offers.  My, my......we are almost talking spy type pictures from 10 miles off. I will let you judge the photos........not for clarity or subject matter.........but just for an example of the zoom range of this camera.  I will say this here........the bus in the photos was roughly 500 feet from my position and all photos were taken hand held from the same spot.<br /><br />But even without the impressive zoom features......this is one heck of a camera. The pictures, even at 5M are crystal clear and will be certain to please. Then with all the built in special modes, the 11 or more internal filter modes, the 23 or so scene selection modes, and full manual mode with shutter or aperture priority mode.........you can go any route that you need for your shooting needs.<br /><br />Another feature I like about this camera is that while filming a video you can press the shutter button and take a still photo. Or while viewing a video you can take still photos from the video. I am anxious to experiment with this more as I have a son in the band and I usually take multiple cameras to their concerts, etc. in order to video it and also take some still shots. With this camera I am hopeful to be able to do both with one instrument.  We have the first White Shoe rehearsal this Thursday and our first football game this Friday.  It will be a time to see what this camera can really do with its zooming ability from up in the stands.<br /><br />In closing, as a camera buff of many years (40+) I am well pleased with this purchase. I have had a Pentax SPII, a Pentax ESII, a Nikon N70, a Nikon D50, several smaller point and shoot type all in one cameras and now this Panasonic. For ease of use, range of features and cost vs ability......I put this Panasonic Lumix at the top of the pack in features.  No, it does not have the quality that either the Pentax or Nikons do.....but then again..........this camera cost a fraction of what they did and some of the individual accessory lenses I have bought for them in the past cost several times the cost of this camera............so it is not even a fair comparison. But for features...........my expensive toys cannot begin to compare with the ability of this camera. I am well pleased with it.  To see the zoom range please look at some of the photos I am going to upload.","Excellent camera! Could not be happier. Amazed at the photo quality, excellent zoom and versatility.","Nice bridge camera for the price. Carry it with me everywhere I go as a stand in for my DSLR.","5star","I have never looked so good in a picture from a point and shoot camera! The automatic filtering is awesome. I was hesitant to buy a new camera as I didn't think we needs one, but I am so glad that my husband insisted that we purchase it!","My wife loves this camera and is very happy with it","Good image, great zoom, easy to use. Works best with a tripod to hold camera steady enough in low light conditions when the camera automatically uses a longer shutter time....otherwise the pictures are out of focus.","This is the greatest camera I have ever bought. I have used cameras for over 60 years and feel comfortable with making a statement like this. I just wish I had this  camera when I was the school photographer in High School.","camera takes great pictures up close and pretty good at full zoom.  there is noise in the photos done at zoom but that is too be expected at this price. the battery last a long time.  I have gotten  over 2000 photos per charge with no flash.  Great video at full zoom however. I do a lot of nature shots and the videos come out the best I have seen in these conditions.","Great Value.  Many expensive SLR features in an affordable easy-to-use camera.","The camera is everything you can expect.<br />Amazing zoom, solid construction, good features. But...<br /><br />Disappointed about the lens, not the usual lieca lens. Understand that they had to cut cost, but still not up to the mark.<br /><br />Again the question comes about the cost. Camera takes a little longer to save the images.<br /><br />Low light performance is very poor.<br /><br />Other than that, the camera performs awesome in bright light conditions.<br /><br />For the cost its well worth the money, but it is not a camera you'll be amazed with.","He tenido que pagar 50 euros por aduanas","Love, love, love this camera!  I've had so much fun experimenting.  Read through the booklet and DVD to get a good head start then get out and enjoy.","Wish I had purchased the Canon SX-50! I share the sentiment expressed by Randy Wakeman in his review of the camera. Nice camera but the SX-50 puts it to shame. I take wildlife photos and my photos do not come close to the focus clarity of friends with the SX-50. Sigh.","Was looking for a second camera body for an extended trip, but sought this one<br />upon recommendation by a friend.  I am very pleased so far.  It is light, for easy<br />carrying and for hand held focusing; the magnification is great.  The auto focus<br />is sometimes a bit slow, but eventually zooms in nicely.  Simple to operate.<br /><br />Brief story about magnification:  friend took a photo of a person about 1/2 mile<br />away, then could not see the person with his unaided eye.  Later found him using<br />10 power binoculars.  Photo was clear.","I purchased this camera back at Christmas time and have used it numerous times. I chose it mainly for its zooming features and am most pleased with how things have worked out and pleasantly surprised by the additional features I am still learning about.<br /><br />Photography is my hobby so this review is coming from that angle. The pictures are crisp and clear. I only have enlarged one (8x10) that I did use the zoom feature on and it came out lovely.<br /><br />I guess it is a personal preference but I love the feel of the camera in my hands and the quality of the photos. Again I am an amateur and just like to walk about and take some photos and print some of them up or post them on tumblr. I receive good feedback on my posts on tumblr so I am going to say others find the color and quality of the photos to fine as well.","Amazing quality and price!! FAST SHIPPING!","This is working out to be a great camera.  I'm not a photographer, I just take pictures.  The FZ70 has replaced an older Panasonic Lumix model that I've been using for 7 years.  This new one is much quicker boot up, it focuses faster, it is truly spectacular in low light conditions.  As with all digital cameras, it has many functions which I will probably never use, but access to this camera's<br />adjustments and settings is much easier and more intuitive than the old camera.  In other words, Panasonic has produced a new model that improves greatly on the old model.  I'm glad I bought it.","ok","Love the zoom. Hard to realize how close things get with a 60X zoom. I suspect that there are many options on this camera that the average \"point and shooter\" will never utilize.","love it","It's a beautiful camera with amazing zoom!","This camera works far better than I expected. Literally just point and shoot for great pictures. I decided to try the Moon shot because it should be very difficult to hold the camera steady. The moon picture on Aug 4 2014 was not done with a tripod. Think I might have a typo and put the 14th instead of the 4th but the picture is what is important. It came out very sharp for a  maximum zoom picture without a tripod. I will absolutely recommend this camera to friends and family.","I bought this camera for a recent trip across the southwest US. My first impression was that this camera is a bit bulkier than I expected. It is basically the same size as a DSLR, while many bridge cameras are smaller. The handgrip is good and it feels good and balanced when held.<br /><br />The photo quality is just awesome. I am no professional by any means, but I do appreciate the quality of this camera and the photos it produces.<br /><br />The things that I used quite a bit on the trip were the dedicated video button (you can start video recording at any time), photos during video (while recording, just snap pictures like normal) and the incredible zoom. While at the Grand Canyon especially, we used the zoom like a digital telescope to investigate things. I was sort of concerned that I wouldn't really use this camera's zooming capabilities, but I quickly found that I was capturing things and getting great crisp close ups of things that I would have passed on with my old digital camera; especially wildlife that we couldn't physically get close to. By the quality and clarity of the photos, you'd never know I was at least 50 to 100 yards away for many shots. The stabilization is outstanding, so at extreme zooms, you can count on crispness.<br /><br />Another great thing that I noticed is how quickly the camera could get from a standing start - meaning turned off to on, then booted up, then zoomed, then focused, then capturing the photo. On our trip, many things would just happen quickly and getting the picture required a quick camera. My wife gave up trying to use her Samsung S3 to get any quick photos because I could grab the camera and complete a picture with the FZ70 in about 3 seconds, no kidding. It's like boom, it's on and ready.<br /><br />I'm having some trouble forcing the flash on like the manual states. I have created my own program setting to accomplish this. I played with manual exposure settings to get some interesting effects. I tried to set it for extra long exposure times for star photos, but so far I can only get it to 60 seconds. There is a ton of options and settings, so I need to dig more.<br /><br />Battery life is good and the camera feels rugged, yet not too heavy. I'm very pleased with this camera and it is a good buy for the money.","I'm not a professional photographer by any stretch. But I have had numerous cameras in my lifetime and this is by far the best one I've ever had. The zoom length is amazing, the color and clarity are SO sharp and \"right on\". I highly recommend this camera.<br />It's also quite eay to use. BUT you have to read the lengthy manual to take advantage of all of its capabilities.","Awesome camera for point & shoot. I do volunteer work as a photographer at a zoo and I bought this camera because of the long-range focal length of its zoom lens, so I can take close up pictures of predatory animals from a safe distance. I am stunned at the quality of the images I get from this camera in its automatic mode. Its intelligent auto mode works so well that I rarely use the manual or other modes. My only gripe about this camera is that I use it so much, the labels on some of the controls have worn off. After I showed this camera and a few of the images I shot to a friend, he went out and bought one to take with him on vacation and he loves it as much as I do. I even took it with me on a trip to Mexico instead of my dSLR camera gear. One night I was on a ferry from Cozumel to Playa Del Carmen when a gorgeous full moon rose in the sky. I shot some spectacular photos of that moon with the lens fully extended, hand held and on a moving boat. Although I shot quite a few duds of the moon, I also shot some incredible photos with it on its intelligent automated mode.<br /><br />Mac users should note that it does shoot raw image files; however, a third party app is needed at this time to work with them on a Mac because Mac OS X 10.9 does not support this camera's raw mode files natively.","I was able to take some awesome shots on my recent vacation. The 60x zoom is fantastic.","muy bueno","Everything is just as expected.  Fast Shipping!  Happy with the purchase.","Excellent product, unbelievable pictures!!!!","bueno","I was going crazy looking for a good camera. had an old Panasonic point n shoot. stuck with what I knew and purchased the DMC-FZ70. Very happy. was nervous about it being used but I cant tell. Very Happy!","DMC-FZ70 is definitely a good buy for the price. I was considering purchasing FZ200 but couldn't justify the cost and FZ70 is 60x zoom vs FZ200 which is only 24x zoom.<br />I am disappointed though that FZ70 doesn't have capability and or plug in for external remote, although the zoom is excellent and you can get close enough to actually see the surface of the moon and or zoom in distant object or birds as they were at your hand reach. It is rather very difficult to remain steady and prevent shaking as the shake of your hand also multiplies 70 times. It is almost impossible to achieve zooming distant object without a tripod that is, if you want clear picture or movie without distortion but this isn't a camera's fault.<br />This camera can't be compared to DSLR's but rather is a good bargain in a bridge camera. There isn't enough right up or videos about this camera but I literally watched every video by Graham Houghton on YouTube about FZ200 and that helped me to decide purchasing FZ70 as the features and functions are nearly identical in these two cameras.","I bought this camera to use when I need a wide to tele travel camera. It works great and I don't have to carry extra len's and equipment like I do when i use my Canon 70D. With all the features The Pansonic has I can shoot in any condition.","Exactly what I wanted..and Panasonic delivered... I am a rank Amateur and don't pretend to KNOW everything about cameras but I do know what I like and don't like.<br /> That said...  I so wanted a LONG LENS camera but knew the traditional DSLR's were more than I could handle.. too heavy and too many lens to carry ..  so I have been buying bridge cameras but wanted one with a SUPER long LENS.<br />..  I had bought a Panasonic in the past and was very pleased with it.. since then have bough Canon's,  Fuji's and Samsungs... but  there s something about the FEEL of this camera in my hand that makes me SMILE.. it fits perfectly... Button's are were they are suppose to be and easy to access.. The camera fits into a standard camera case... and not a lot of extra's are needed to make this an amazing tool.<br />  The onboard menu is easy to understand.. and MAKES SENSE.. it follows logical progression... something I don't often do but other might but it has some great in camera EDITING... options.<br />  The weight of this camera is nominal.. easy to handle and carry either around you neck or in a sm  camera bag.<br />As  I previous said it fits my hand well....that is one thing I leaved from buying a variety of cameras from various makers.. If it doesn't feel good in you hand as SOON as you pick it up.. it will never feel comfortable.. no matter what..<br /> ..... One thing the camera does NOT have is wifi access.. I easily solved that with a EYE FI Mobi SD card.. ( works PERFECTLY)...not knowing how well I might like it I go the sm size a 8 gig and .. Honestly that is wonderful.... you can transfer you photos as soon as you take them to a tablet or cell phone..  and NO WI FI SIGNAL IS NEEDED...  but this isn't what your interested in...<br />.......  The camera has some surprising and easy to use features that I was UNAWARE of when I bought it... I has a very easy to sue Panorama option...... and it has a 3D option to use while taking videos.. ( you can only use this if you view your 3D pictures on a tv w 3 D capabilities ) but it is something I was not aware that it could do..<br />.......  Videos are NICE... bright and clear and sounds has definitely been improved over my previous Panasonic.<br />Lots of creative filters to try out  but  you can completely let the camera do all the heavy lifting for picture taking if you don't want to MESS with all those setting.. the auto modes on this camera do a bang up job.<br />  Honestly... I can't say that I want or NEED anything else on this camera... other than the missing wifi access which I easily solved.. for me this camera is a Perfect Match..<br />  I got a great MONO pod to use when taking the LONG Telephoto shots...  and a few lens filters.. and I am totally SET<br />I am delighted with this product and Highly recommend it .<br />....... Buy one and go out and take some amazing photos .. your friends and family will be Shocked and Delighted<br /> .","Got it for work, man its great!","Incredible zoom which allowed me to capture poster-worthy images of the craters on this recent Supermoon, even w/o the benefit of a tripod.<br /><br />Curious to see now if it will pull into focus these Drones in the NW skyline -","Excellent camera for the price point.  Even at max zoom, the auto focus can compensate for my hands, the pictures are very clear and crisp, and it does pretty decent video too.","To fully enjoy the use of this camera,  YOU NEED TO READ THE MANUALS, BOTH OF THEM.  YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE ADVANCED MANUAL AND READ IT.  This camera has amazing capabilities.  The zoom capabilities without reverting to the use of the digital zoom are awe-inspiring.  The Intelligent Zoom is better than a digital zoom, and it extends the zoom capabilities to more than the 60x figure.  I have used both.  The intelligent zoom will give you a photo with fewer megapixels, but the distortion common to digital zooming is missing.  Since you're starting with 16.1 mp, you can well afford to reduce the mp for the purpose of getting a long shot, but you don't even have to do that if you use the zoom attachment you can purchase with the adapter.<br /><br />I also have the adapter for the zoom attachment and the close-up attachment.  I was using a FZ100, and the same accessories work.  For the record,  you can use the regular zoom AND the intelligent zoom with the telephoto attachment which allows you to get magnificent zoom capabilities without using a digital zoom.<br /><br />This camera also has good wide angle capabilities as well - at least as wide as I ever want.  It doesn't do fisheye.<br /><br />It has macrofocusing down to 1 mm AND macro zoom focusing, which is delightful and will enlarge the subject.  And I have the close-up attachment as well, although so far the macro zoom has produced pictures I'm happy with, so I haven't used it.  .<br /><br />It has many different focusing choices.  You need to see what they are and see which one works for you.  The flexible focus is my favorite.  Uses a bit more battery, but it is faster continuous focus than the one labeled continuous focus.  This is why you have to read the directions.  There is also manual focus.  And standard focus.<br /><br />They have skimped on not making the vewing screen moveable to different angles.  If you want to take a time exposure, you mght want to use the timed shutter release to avoid camera movement, since there is no input for an external shutter button.  And yes, those things would have been nice, BUT I couldn't afford the camera if they hadn't kept the price down.  This is a hobby of mine, not a profession.<br /><br />This is one whopper of a camera for the price.  I think they economized in the right places and spent the money on the best kind of image stabilization that you can get - a necessity if you are going to use such a zoom.<br /><br />I have set my camera to limit the shutter speeds (found in the camera menu settings) so that it can't automatically go to too slow a speed.  Panasonic recommends a tripod -- and it's very true that a good tripod helps - but ninety nine percent of the time, when I want a photo, I either don't have my tripod with me, or it's not set up -- so I am handholding shots that should be on a tripod -- because the deer will leave -- or the birds or small animals are active -- I'm often taking a walk, and I use the zoom to photograph wild flowers I can't get close to without getting into poison ivy or some such thing.<br /><br />My advice for handheld shots is to use the shutter speed limit, so the shutter speed can't go too slow on you.  I often use shutter priority, risking the shot being too dark, but there is also an option in the setup stuff. Often, even if a picture is too dark, you can improve it with software.<br /><br />The camera also had editing capabilities, but I use Corel's software on my PC.<br /><br />I take LOTS OF PHOTOS.  If you think you can't hand hold the camera, snap as many photos as you can, and try.  Hold your breath and get your elbows close to your sides -- really - it steadies you -- or find something to lean on, if possible, and do your best.  Sometimes it doesn't work, but often if I take a lot of photos, at least a couple of them will be sharp, because I snapped the picture at just the right moment.<br /><br />The beauty of digital photography is that you don't have to pay for your flops.  You can just delete them, and keep the good ones.<br /><br />This is not a professional photographer's camera, although I would bet that pros would have one whopper of a good time with it.  But I don't have the money to buy a pro's camera, nor do I have the ability to carry the camera equipment I used to -- nor do I have the money to spare for excessive film and processing.<br /><br />SO I am as happy as a hog in a mud waller with this camera.  It take good pictures.  As with any camera, you need to get used to this particular one.  I have a particular combination of metering and exposure that I usually use -- you could vary your choices to suit yourself, BUT YOU WON'T DO THAT IF YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD THE ADVANCED MANUAL AND READ IT.<br /><br />I went to the trouble to print out the manual, because I studied it in odd places in order to cover the information.  It is convenient to have it on your computer, too, but I wanted a print out.  I printed it one section at a time.<br /><br />This is a wonderful camera for the money.  If I could afford the setup the National Geographic photographers use, I wouldn't be able to carry it anyway.  This camera is a great deal of fun, and if you will take the time to master the vast number of choices you have available, you will surely enjoy it.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.","Don't buy this camera expecting the same clarity (sharpness) of a $700 camera.  The super zoom ability is a great plus if (for example) your kid is in a show at school and you can't get a photo from the 26th row without a powerful zoom.  For most amateur photographers (like myself) who need a good point-and-shoot camera, this one is a winner.","Great camera!  Nice photo quality","I really love this camera because of the zoom. 60x!! It's amazing! You always have to use it with a tripod, else the picture will be blurry with such high zoom. I would have given it a 5star if not for the size. It's a bit big and not very suited for travelling/<br /><br />For a well balanced camera with good quality and zoom, you may consider the following sony model<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CDIK48U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CDIK48U&linkCode=as2&tag=justckem-20","this camera is AMAZING!  I can't say enough about how many beautiful shots I have taken with it.  Last night I tried it out at the 4th of july fireworks.  I got some beautiful shots!  it's way technical and I know very little about anything other than the Auto menu, but I am very happy with the results.  The idiot button works!  happy, happy, happy!!!","A lot in a compact package ,very good,and good value .Now,to master all the features!","Bulkier and heavier than expected but it takes very good pictures and people comment on the clarity of it's long reach.  Movies are also very good.","Another wonderful Panasonic camera. This is the 3rd one I have owned and I have enjoyed all of them. I am still getting used to the range on this one but I have taken some wonderful bird pictures.","Easy to use<br />Good pictures<br />Single Len Convenience. Zooming feature is the best of all.<br />No camera or delivery issues to date.<br />For the price, This is a good and convenient camera to have","This is my third lumix. These products perform. I had a much older version of this one which I loved but let the family borrow it to go whale watching. There were several versions of the story but all indications are that the camera hit the deck hard. Never quite worked after that. I use the camera for work so I replaced it quickly with one of the smaller Lumix cameras. It was wonderful and I used it daily for the past 3 years. But I have large hands and yearned for the larger model. This new camera has several advantages over the smaller Lumix's and it's predasesser as well.<br /><br />The image stabilizer is terrific. I'm a Real Estate Appraiser and I buzz past recently sold houses and listed houses while I snap a picture. My photos come out beautifully. I use many pictures in my appraisal files and require very small picture files - thumbnails really. Well this camera easily adjusts the picture size down, then back to larger files later for family shots. That's the other thing - I also bought this camera to update my video camera. The motion picture button is a great convenience and while I've only used it a couple times so far, it appears to produce great video. I pop up the flash for house interiors and get great results. Sometimes it does this thing where it takes multiple images then combines them into one. Then it makes you wait a sec while it saves that. I'd just assume it just flash since the resulting pics are just ok - so that's one thing. But then I put down the flash and work outside and the camera transitions beautifully.  One last thing - the optical zoom works well.<br /><br />Some appraisers are using their iPhones and putting the pics right into the file. That's pretty kool and I get that. But using a real camera still gets a way better result than a phone. I'm sticking with my Lumix.","Panasonic FZ70 review<br /><br />Update 2014-11-06 -- Added the fifth star. At current prices, this is an excellent choice. I continue to be very happy with mine.<br /><br />There are many reviews here already, so I will just give some of my impressions based on a few days of use. I may come back and update more as I have more time with this camera.<br /><br />First, if your expectations are reasonable, I think most will be happy with this camera. At under $300 currently, it delivers great value. It has a rare 20mm wide angle at the short end and the 60X zoom at the long end (plus extended zoom modes for even more reach). The 20mm wide angle was a big draw for me as I shoot a lot of landscape stuff. It works well for that and also for interior shots. Sharpness is not an issue and color is very accurate, better than average for sure. The zoom seems fine as well. Bit harder to shoot at the long end, of course, but hand held shots can be done, which is amazing at that focal length. Of course, a tripod is great if you can use one along with the timer (since there is no remote release). You lose a bit of contrast at the long end and some softness, but that is to be expected and the overall results at normal viewing sizes are good.  Of course there are some issues if you \"pixel-peep\" at the image 1:1 on your screen, but that's not how the image is going to be viewed.  For normal viewing, the images look fine and should print fine. Haze can actually be an issue with the long zoom, but that is true with any zoom in this range. You will need to brace properly or use a tripod for best results, but in a pinch, handheld can be done, the OIS works well.<br /><br />The FZ70 is a bit bigger than I expected, but there's a lot of lens to house, so understandable. It is fairly light and the design is good, a good grip and feels balanced. All the controls are well placed. Panasonic has been making these things forever, so they really have that down pat. The screen seems fine for this price range, the EVF is  good enough for composing images and is a big plus in bright sunlight. Plus I like using the viewfinder for stability when shooting long (bracing the camera against your face helps stabilize it). Build quality seems good. Yes, it's a bit \"plasticky\" but at these prices, that's fine. Still feels fairly sturdy.<br /><br />The FZ70 focuses quickly and well and renders tones smoothly. Tests shots of clouds were better than average in that regard as compared to many compacts and P&S models. Color is very good. Noise control seems well done at lower ISO's and is usually not noticeable in casual viewing. In low light, you will see it, of course, but it is fairly well controlled even then under 800 ISO. Certainly fine for this price range and intended uses.  There are many modes available, some actually useful, and some interesting in-camera editing capabilities for those who wish to do that. Lots of choices and customization's available. The iA and iA+ modes seem to work pretty well, The scene modes seem fine. All in all the camera has met my expectations so far and I am happy with it. Giving it 4 stars for now based on value delivered and good performance. May come back and raise that to 5, but not enough experience yet to go there.  Big thing is, this is a lot of camera for $300 bucks or so, and that 20mm wide end is pretty rare and a nice plus on top of that long zoom.","This is SO easy to use.  I was nervous when I received it because my camera experience has been a smartphone.  The instructions are easy!  I am ever so pleased with this purchase and the photo quality is AMAZING.","Owned for a few weeks now. Used almost exclusively for nature photography, ranging from close ups of insects to distance shots of birds.<br /><br />The FZ70 does many things well: it has a great zoom, the buttons for control of the features are easy to reach, even when your eye is pressed to the viewfinder (after a bit of practice), and has enough stabilization to allow sharp, handheld photos at full optical magnification. The manual focus control isn't nearly as good or as quick as a ring, but will get the job done if your subject will stay still. It's not a macro camera by any means, but I've been happy with butterfly photos taken far enough away to not startle the insect.<br /><br />That being said, comparing to my partner's Canon SX50, a few limitations have made themselves clear. The first, and most obvious, is the difference in digital zoom. Pushing the magnification beyond the optical limitations, the FZ70's quality deteriorates much, much more rapidly than the Canon. For distant shots of eagles, the Canon still looks crisp while the FZ70 becomes fuzzy. This holds for both for automatic and for various manual settings. The screen and viewfinder also aren't quite up to par, which makes determining perfect focus or reviewing photos a bit more of a challenge.<br /><br />At the time of this review, the FZ70 is also $100 cheaper than the Canon SX50, which certainly played into my purchasing decision. It is a very good camera, but I wouldn't say it's the best in its class.","the zoom for this camera is great with a high focus and you can take photos in any light conditions and the photos will still be sharp and clear , i have bought this camera to take with me on a vacation and i have made the correct choice when buying this camera","I did not expect a zoom camera has such good image.<br />Zoom range is one thing, the stabilization is good too.<br />better than expected","This is the best camera have ever had. it uses a MOS sensor which is much more accurate and clear than CMOS that is used everywhere. (GOOGLE MOS VS CMOS). the 60x lens with image stabilization is amazing. you will hear the little stabilization motors running when it is zoomed out. it has great wide angle at the other end. the battery lasts way longer than any point and shoot. it has dozens of modes to shoot under. I bought a 64gig chip for it.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to get this camera. I did lots of research and comparisons and this one wins hands down. I am an electrical engineer ... total geek and nurd.<br /><br />larry ponziani","This is a great camera. The 60x times optical zoom is like having a<br />portable telescope. Every person who has seen it work is amazed.<br />One single lens covers 20mm-1200mm equivalent and  Full 1080/60i<br />HD Panasonic Video recording with auto focus. All of this in one camera!<br />No more lenses to change. No chance of dust and stuff getting in the camera,<br />especially on windy days.","I am an amateur photographer and prefer taking pictures of wildlife, which includes insects and birds. The zoom on this camera allows me to get closer than I've ever gotten before! I have purchased many cameras on-line, but most of them are returned because of the difficulty of using them...that is not true with this camera. I have had many Lumix cameras before and the only reason I upgrade is because they keep improving the range of the zoom. They serve well, translate color well, and are easy to operate.","Panasonic camera<br />  Overall performance meets expectations and manufacturers claims.<br />The viewing screen is difficult to see in bright sunlight.A tilt screen<br />would help,but this is a common problem.Viewfinder works well as<br />alternative.Overall gives good value for pric range.","The camera takes the best zoom pictures!  I took the camera into Best Buy to find a camera bag for it.  The salesman kept playing with it.  He loved it!  The price was very good.  I priced it at other stores, and Amazon beat them by $100.  Now I need to learn how to use some of the special features on it.","Although I only have had this a few weeks it is a very nice camera. The zoom features are awesome it will amaze you how good of images at max zoom even when hand held. The only thing I am not sure of is the selector/adjustor wheel if this mechanism proves to be reliable then I think we have another winner here.","This is my third DMC-series Lumix. I love them. For price, image quality, flexibility and ease of operation they can't be beat. I managed a lot of shots in Africa while the SLR crowd was fumbling with lenses that cost three- to five-times (or more) what my whole camera cost. If you are all about heavy, insanely expensive GEAR, buy an SLR. If you are about images, this camera is a delightful tool to use.","Excellent camera! Fabulous zoom! Camera is great for nature photography, The camera has excellent Macro capabilities. Accessories are also available.","Overall, it's a good camera and takes good quality pictures if you leave it on auto. The main downfall I have and the reason for an average rating is because the booklet show a port for a remote but the camera does not have one. This is one model that does not allow for a remote shutter release. I also tried to find an underwater case and found out that they do not make one for this camera as well.<br /><br />I contacted Panasonic and was not happy with the response. I doesn't look like the plan to make a remote shutter release for this model.<br /><br />Very disaapointed!!!!","Love this camera! I have all kinda of cameras and lenses but when it comes down to it I don't want to carry them around! This is everything in one!","I love this camara, it is amazing what you can do with it and its zoom is awsome. The only down side I think it feals a little fragile.","I researched hybrid all-in-ones for weeks and finally settled on this model - for the money there is none better. It takes incredible photos, GREAT video and is easy to use. The only negative is the video capture is a proprietary Panasonic file type and you have to buy the conversion software separately to make your DVD's - but, that's not a huge deal considering how well the camera does both photos and video - awesome.","Let's me take the great extreme telephoto & wide angle shots with little WA distortion & minor chromatic aberration at extreme tele.  The user interface is somewhat awkward and difficult to learn & I would like to see more range of f stops for greater control over depth of field, particularly at the small aperture range (f8 doesn't do it for me, it should go down to f22 at least).","Wow, what a zoom! I added on another zoom lens that attaches right to the front of the existing lense, with no adapters or anything needed, and now I have over 100X zoom on a compact digital camera! Now, I am not a professional photographer by any means, and can't tell you any technical stuff, but this camera is AWESOME! I had two Nikon DSLR's in the past, and they were just very complicated and very heavy for me to use all the time, this is fairly lightweight, and takes stunning photos. I'm in love. Between this and my LX7 I am set for awhile with cameras!","I own a Canon SLR, two Fuji bridge cameras, two Olympus point and shoot and one other Panasonic pocket point and shoot.<br /><br />By far, this is the best camera I have.  Love the zoom (WOW!!)  Really great stabilization.<br /><br />I am shooting the neighbors flowers one petal at a time.<br /><br />Really love this camera.","Did a video of my grandson's eight grade jazz band performance in the school aud.  We sat more than half way back. I used MP4 FHD and iA+ plus beyond 60X optical and adjusted the exposure for the overhead lighting. The resulting video was sharply focused and skin tones were natural. So close that he seemed to be standing in front of me.<br /><br />At 10MP, iZoom enabled 151X optical.  Excellent camera for long zoom enthusiasts at a low price.","I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now and have shot about 1500 photos with it.  I wanted a bridge camera that had a longer zoom than my fz200, didn't break the bank and was small and light enough to actually keep with me.  At 60x, fz70 has almost twice the optical zoom of my fz200 and I can still use the doubling lens I bought for the fz200 once I purchase an adapter if I need more than a 1200mm zoom.  Don't get me wrong, I love the fz200, the low light capabilities of the fz70 doesn't compare but the 60x zoom is nothing short of amazing.  The picture quality is fine for my needs (snapshots, travel photos, birding shots) and the camera is light enough to keep in my backpack.  I am a novice birder and the ability to get a decent picture of a bird a good distance away is helping me learn to id what I was missing before.  I am more than happy with this camera.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Did I mention it has a 60x optical zoom?<br />- Small enough to keep with me.  Can't get great pics if the camera is sitting at home.<br />- Picture quality is decent.  Not as good as the fz200 but you don't pay as much for this camera either.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Battery life.  Not great.  Can be extended by dimming the screen and turning off the setting to keep the focus motor going.<br />- File name conflicts.  Since I own two Panasonic cameras I have to be creative when importing photos.  There is no way to alter the file naming convention of PXXXXXXX.JPG so it is easy to overwrite files if both cameras are being used.  There is a site online that tells how to jump ahead in the numbering schema but that is just putting off the problem. [...]  I've resorted to uploading the files from this camera to a specific folder then running a script to change the filename from PXXXXXX.JPG to QXXXXXX.JPG.  An extra step I wish I didn't have to remember to do.","great \"bridge\" type camera. lots of great features even for a beginner. software for editing a little \"lax\", but over-all very good for home use. will be taking to sons college graduation.  Practice with settings and feel before you \"need\" it.  Have not printed yet but am encouraged.  very glad of purchase after much review about features and price.  HAPPY","This camera is a great step up from a simple point and shoot, while keeping all the usefulness of a point and shoot.  The zoom is incredible, and of course requires steady hands to get the best shot possible.  That said, the image stabilizer helps and you can actually take reasonably clear shots zoomed in by hand.  I was at a ball game the other night, and from my seat, the entire park fit in the frame of a single picture.  Zooming in, without digital zoom (60x), the batter would fill more than the screen and I was able to see footprints in the dirt...<br /><br />I also took the camera to the races, and after a handful of attempts was able to get a classic picture with a clear car and blurry background.  That takes a little more skill to accurately track the car so it remains clear.  Easy to use, and the battery life actually lasted much, MUCH, longer than I was expecting.  Leaving the camera on, allowing it to sleep when it wants, I would be able to take fairly nonstop pictures all day I did buy 2 extra (generic) batteries as I plan to take this on a two week trip to Peru, but I am confident that it will have enough life.  The camera does have some weight to it but is easy to use.","this camera is so easy and i love the pictures that i have been taking so far. i don't  regret this purchase","Nice Camera, full HD pics and Video, not as heavy as las lumix versions. I am really happy to have it.","I love the camera and the zoom. I have taken it on a recent vacation and I am so please with the quality of the photos","This one of the greatest camera that I have seen for the money. This is a lot more camera then a first timer needs. We on a cruise and this took great picture way our there. And very clear.","Takes the BEST pictures I've ever taken.  Clear, Brilliant Color, Just over all the BEST<br /><br />I would recommend this camera to everyone that wants exceptional photos!!!!","I gave it 5 stars in reference to the price. While you'll never mistake the photos taken by this for photos from a nice dslr, for the money this camera performs really well. The balance is a little strange since the majority of the weight is the excellent zoom, but is comfortable enough in the hand for the average application. High speed shooting is definitely not a strength; it's not recommended for birding unless you're comfortable being very persistent and are prepared to shoot A LOT, which is unacceptable to most birders. Indoor shooting is okay in most lighting conditions, though it struggles in low light. The flash is powerful for a pop-up, as with all cameras the learning curve for indoor shots is a bit steeper. I may sound a bit negative, but overall I really like the performance vs. price. For the average user, I highly recommend this product.","Fantastic camera that can do about everything there is to do for stills.  Video I don't know.  Auto focus is iffy at the long end so expect to shoot several shots to get a good one.  Also don't expect DSLR image quality.  The tiny pixels in the sensor mean artifacts in the image if you insist on diving in beyond 100%.  The lens runs from ultra wide 20 mm equivalent to 1200.  Wow!!","It is a very good camera for the price BUT I would not buy it again for some reasons:<br />1. The quality of the lens is not very good, there is a lot of chromatic aberration whenever you use the optical zoom.<br />2. As happened with another Lumix I had (FZ30), there is a lot of noise whenever you use an ISO higher than 100. I compared images taken with this camera and a Canon Powershot A710is (under the same circumstances and similar settings) and when you amplify the image in your monitor at the point that you can see the pixels, there is a lot more noise on the images taken with the Lumix.<br />Other than that, the video is very nice, and the optical zoom is simply unbelievable.","So far have had no issues with this camera. The optical zoom is great. Look forward to trying more with it.","First camera she is reading the manual to see what else it can do.  Love the details of birds  at 60x","I bought this for work because I need to occasionally take pictures or video of things to upload to social media sites. I am not a good photographer. I just need something that works. But I truly was blown away by this camera. I only use the basic, camera-figures-out-everything setting. I know nothing about any of the other settings. But now my pics have gone from sufficient to nearly artistic.<br /><br />The quality and ease are simply amazing. I kid you not, I was able to get framable, clear, up close shots of a bald eagle that was sitting in a tree about a quarter mile away. And I was not using a tripod or anything else. Just point, zoom and shoot.<br /><br />So listen to all these other reviewers who actually know something about cameras, but as a complete idiot when it comes to this stuff, this camera is great.","My sister is not an accomplished photographer at all, but she found this camera at a local camera store and took it on our trip to Tanzania in February. I wanted a super-zoom too and got the Coolpix P530 because we use Nikon's at my office and I was very familiar with the interface. Well, this Lumix definitely outperformed my Coolpix. It has a longer zoom, which I knew ahead of time. I could not get the Coolpix to adjust focus when I shot video and zoomed in and out, there was audible noise on the zooms. And the Lumix has the ability to adjust photos in the camera, which is pretty cool and which we are all getting used to on our smartphones. When I got back, I returned the Coolpix and purchased this Lumix, and have not regretted it a bit. I'm sure I haven't taken it through all of it's bells and whistles, but so far, I'm very pleased with the purchase.","This is an excellent camera. I took it to Israel with me and it did well. The zoom lens was excellent in daylight, even when hand held. Remember, this is not a DSLR. My Nikon D200 with a good Nikon zoom lens would have taken better pictures in a particular range, but I didn't want to take three lenses. I was able to get close-ups and distance shots with one camera. If you are looking for something better than your phone camera and better than the low end point and shoot, this camera is for you.","I have a DSLR and I have a pocket camera. The pocket camera does what it was designed to do. Sit in your pocket and take pictures. They were never great but...I purchased the DMC-FZ70 after several weeks of research and I must say I am very impressed. I have had it for three weeks now and I am still finding new features. In fact the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I have to \"find\" the new features the manual could be better in explaining all the camera does. Shooting in RAW format is great and works well. Great camera smaller and lighter than a DSLR and much better quality pictures than a pocket camera.","It is a good upgrade from the basic point and shoot camera or cell phone camera.  Definately not the same quality as a DSLR, but that is expected.  A good travel camera.  To get the most out of the camera, you really want to start learning how to use the manual settings.  One note for low light/night time shots, the manual settings only allow a maximum of an 8 second exposure.  Auto allows for longer exposures.","Bought this for my wife and the 60X zoom is fantastic. We will be traveling from AZ to AK and we'll see how the animal pics turn out. She had a pervious version of this camera and loved it. It's a little bulky, but mainly because of the 1200mm zoom capability.","I'm totally impressed with this Lumix. I'm not an uber-photographer but I know my way around point/shoot cameras. I did my research before I bought my first long zoom camera.  I have had Nikon, Canon, Fuji. All are well made and do what you would expect. But this Lumix FZ70 is over the top good. I have not even tried all the features yet. Basically I set it to auto everything and I'm just loving the images I'm getting. Will be taking it on our Europe trip later on this summer. Just a quick example: Last week during the full \"blood moon\" we had a great view of it here in California. I put the camera on a tripod, set the zoom to 100x and waited. When it went into full eclipse I touched the shutter button. Because of the low light it automatically took a series of 7 or 8 shots. I could hear it during the process. The aggregated image was spectacular. The blood moon effect was awesome. I put it up on FB and received many kudos for the shot. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Way to go Panasonic. Did I mention the lens? Killer resolution on both wide and telephoto modes.","I think many people including me bought this camera because of its 60X zoom.  The zoom is remarkable, but after you use the camera for a while you find out some wonderful things that are not really talked about.<br /><br />First, the camera does a remarkable job recognizing back lite scenes and compensates remarkably well.  If for example you open the flash and there is a bright window behind the person whose picture you are taking it compensates perfectly.  Often it can compensate for back lite without the flash, but it will remind you when back light requires flash.<br /><br />Second, with flash skin tones are remarkable.  Also, most flashes on little cameras wash out at close range this one doesn't.  It also compensates so that you don't find people up close are overexposed while everything in the background goes dark.  Obviously this only works up to a point.<br /><br />I always shoot with the the red label (iA). you have nothing to lose and much to gain. This provides a modest HDA exposure that doesn't scream \"manipulation\" and also, I believe, provides some sharpening.<br /><br />Even with a sturdy tripod it is just about impossible to keep the camera steady while pushing the shutter button at 60X.  So use time delay with your tripod on long shots.<br /><br />Robert I. Rhodes","I got this Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 digital camera earlier this year here to replace a similar digital camera that died on me & I needed a good replacement digital camera. I chose this camera & several spare batteries over many others. I have had other  compact Panasonic Lumix digital cameras over the past few years with generally good luck with those.<br />This digital camera looks very nice & rather professional-looking. This is a sizable super-zoom bridge digital camera and it feels very good when I use it. Nice sizable grip on it helps a lot too when picture-taking.<br /><br />Pros: Pretty extensive menu system that's fairly easy to use, great wide lens and decent 60X optical zoom, long battery life, optical view finder, external flash attachment, looks pretty well-built and professional looking as well and seems durable. Many photo scene modes and full manual modes also included on this camera. Uses the easy to find SD or SDHC cards. Nice photo qualities also even tho it cannot compare against DSLR cameras. Focuses pretty quick for me and really no operational issues at all with this camera. Everything seems to work well on this digital camera for me.<br /><br />Cons: Short burst shooting modes, LCD screen is fixed into the camera & does not tilt out or flip out like Canon & Nikon comparable digital cameras.<br /><br />Photo qualities with this camera varies: outdoor photos with no flash I get fantastic photos, low light photos is a bit trickier with this camera & photo qualities suffer quite a bit, indoor photos with flash ends up quite nice with this camera....but can be a bit washed-out if you're too close to the subject you're photographing. Overall photo qualities with this Panasonic digital camera are very good and I am very pleased with what photos I have taken so far with this camera. Video qualities with this camera are as good as any other digital camera I have had....very good.<br /><br />I did get a few extra batteries and an extra charger plus a lens hood for this camera....the lens hood makes the camera look a bit more professional and does help photos a bit in bright sunny weather. Plus I got a case for this camera.<br /><br />If you want a decent super zoom digital camera and cannot afford a larger CMOS sensor [1 inch CMOS] super zoom digital camera or DSLR digital camera and still get fairly good photos at a pretty good price, I think this camera will do the job just fine.<br />The only other rival digital cameras I think that can compare with this camera is a Canon SX-50 HS and maybe the Canon SX-60 HS. I have both of those cameras and photo qualities are comparable between all 3 digital cameras at this point. Nikon's P600 may be a rival too, but from what I have heard from other users is that Nikon camera has focusing issues.<br />This is my third redo of this review & originally I gave it 3 stars, then 4 stars....now I am giving this Panasonic FZ70 digital camera 5 of 5 stars because I have had it long enough & used it enough now....and I am still getting consistently good photos with this camera . So now I can finally finalize this review once and for all.","Even I can take decent pictures with this camera! I have a hand tremor so normally have a great deal of difficulty getting decent pictures. Went to Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square PA and followed my normal practice of taking an enormous number of pictures in the hope of getting a few decent shots. Out of 337 332 were good. (I posted some shots I took that day.) Even with the zoom extended completely I am able to get decent pictures. The AI setting does a great job even in low light conditions, it's easy to use, and battery life is excellent. I am beyond pleased and will experiment with settings other than AI. I have not used the video feature so can't comment on that.","I feel so  PROFESSIONAL when that whopping zoom goes out! Great pix. I'm still learning settings. It's  my  4th Lumix!","excellent camera, the zoom is amazing, plus its effects on photographs very useful, I am delighted with my camera, I recommend ...","This is a great choice for $277, it's got a great zoom lens and takes clear photos. I do wish it had the wifi capabilities like some newer models but this is a great option for beginners like me!","takes great pics close up and far away.  quality great an every light weight.  lens is attached so no head for changes lens. this is great for trips afar.","This is a very good camera in all respects, and great value for the money.  It could use a vari-angle lens, but that's about my only suggestion at this point.","I will give an A for this item! Works great and just love it !Would recommend it to anyone! Great!","This is an amazing piece of technology for the price. It can take brilliant photo and video, well beyond my expectations.  Great battery life and easy to use controls.","hi.. this camera is amaizing , very easy to use and the 60x zoom is wonderfull i need more time for review the many options to use","Amaizing camera","Use it daily for newspaper photography. Adequate shutter speed. Feels good. Lots of fun. Primarily I leave it on intelligent auto focus, and have no worries. Good point and shoot.","This is more camera than I've ever used.  I love it so much.  Last week I had to travel for business and I shot through the water into the sand and got a clear view of the shore.  I also shot a fast moving creek and it stopped the action with the water in motion.  If you are just starting your time as a serious photographer I would heartily recommend this camera.  If you're unsure of setting it will do it for you, if you want to experiment you can do that too.  I did look into bridge cameras and this particular was rated number one on several consumer sights.  Enjoy yourself.  So much fun and such a big reward.  I'm hooked.  When I figure out how, I'll include some of the photos I've taken.","The camera does have good zoom power but the picture quality is not what I had expected.  It is also difficult to get clear focus when using the zoom.","Went to Grapefruit League spring training games - bright Florida sunlight!! Took great photos using max zoom from right field with no tripod. Also some great bird shots using mid tele in overcast situation - still great photos! Easy to use, great features - I recommend this camera for telephoto work without extra lenses! Great for vacationers.","Initially, bird pics were soft. Lowering the Noise Reduction setting to -2 gives more sharpness and detail but still with good noise control. If needed, noise reduction is done in pp. I really like the rendering in the FZ70 pics. It doesn't have the fast lens and other features of my FZ200, but noise control is better, IMO, so you can use higher ISOs. Also, compared to the FZ200, iZoom performs much better, fewer artifacts, very usable pics. The camera focuses very fast. A great birding camera.<br /><br />I do wish it had an articulating screen, remote shutter socket, larger buffer, but you can't have everything at this price.","Just ordered, and received it in 1 day. The camera is everything if not more than I expected, the quality is tops. Photos are superb. Love the 3D settings, the panorama settings, everything.  I had a Canon SX50 HS before this, even though the pics were good and I hated the handling of it, sold it and bought this one. This one is tops in my books.","A quick, short review is all that is needed.  This is a bridge camera and not a dslr so with that in mind, this camera for the money is the best you can do.  I have had lots of bridge cameras from all makes (even the Canon SX50 which is a very good camera, but with crazy set up controls and too small), but this one beats them all taking the cost into account.  The zoom is phenomenal especially if you set the camera to 7MP and put it on a tripod.  This zoom should be illegal!!  Or you can shoot at the 16MP and go to 60x and get a great shot.  Sure it has some weak points like no tilting LCD, but every camera has its weak points. IQ clarity is a strength for this camera.  With the price it is selling for on Amazon, I should buy another one.","My wife and I had been in the market for some time for a high-quality, relatively easy-to-use camera that would be especially great for non-professionals like us who like taking quality travel/nature photos and has good zoom.  We did not want to jump into the DSLR arena, but wanted to get shots as-close-as-possible.  After painstakingly researching media and reviews for all of the latest models in this category, I couldn't pass up the deal on this Lumix FZ70.<br /><br />I have to say, I feel this camera is one of the best value purchases I've ever made.  First of all, the exterior fit, finish, and feel inspire immediate confidence, as the materials used and weightiness of the device exude quality.  Not chintzy at all.  I tested and compared the Canon SX50 in-store, and while that is also a very capable camera, the Lumix just feels and looks so much more high-quality in person.  Secondly, the ease of use and capability of taking great photos right out of the box, especially in iAuto mode was astonishing.  We were immediately taking awesome photos of our pets up close, and distant birds and squirrels out in the yard on full 60X zoom, with nice bokeh effect and great color and quality.  If the lighting outdoors leaves something to be desired, some of the quick post-processing effects can be implemented to immediately color-up, sharpen, brighten, etc to produce beautiful images with little effort.  Image stabilization is top-notch, as I have been able to take several long-zoom outdoor shots without a tripod with ease, just using simple technique tricks like using the viewfinder while bracing elbows against the body, etc.  Auto-focus is fast and accurate, burst shooting mode is also wonderful, as it greatly increases your odds of getting that perfect shot without any noticeable extra effort on your part.<br /><br />Although I know there are many reviews that nit-pick on various things such as indoor photo quality, my use of the camera indoors has produced very good results, with a nice flash that doesn't wash out pictures at all.  I feel that for the average user who wants to shoot photos above the capabilities of the average point-and-shoot that appear 'professional' to 95% of viewers, you can't go wrong with this camera.  I have an aging Canon PowerShot SD1100IS small handheld that has taken some amazing photos for me through the last several years, and this Lumix FZ70 with its amazing zoom capabilities is the perfect natural progression to the next level.  At this price point, you can't go wrong.  Highly recommended!","I read from one reviewer that he did not like the images. My concern was focus. Side dug out my window mount because you must have a steady mount if you're going to take pictures at high magnification. Now in the book it says something about pushing the button halfway down and the focus button. I haven't got the hang of that yet, so I will have to read the book. But just using the camera like I did with my old Panasonic, pushing the capture button down halfway until I see the green image box, I got some pretty good pictures. I also got some out of focus pictures because I was fiddling around trying to use that focus button. Like I say, I got to go back to the manual.<br /><br />I learned that I can use the 60 X manual focus but that I'm not restricted to that. I noticed that I could get up to 120 X digital .<br /><br />Go to my website to see some of the pic and video I took with this camera: BestBirdingBinoculars.com<br /><br />John T. Jones, Ph.D. Buhl, Idaho<br /><br />I was worried about buying this camera because of the battery. I gave my other Panasonic to my granddaughter because when I'm birding,I don't want a dead battery. So let not have problems with this, I ordered to back up batteries.<br /><br />I did not buy a new memory card because I had one. That food in the camera and after four shots, it said the card was full. Well it only had four shots on. I have put back in the camera level tested again but it looks like I will be buying a new card.<br /><br />I'll let you know how things go for me.<br /><br />John","I miss my Nikon horribly but I do enjoy this little gem for about half the price. The pictures were very comparable to my Nikon Coolpix 500. I also like the fact I can attach an awesome zoom lens for very close and personal pictures. I can also attach a wide angle lens for panoramic shots. The only thing that truly disappoints me is that it does not automatically shut its self off. User beware and remember to bring several extra batteries for long photo shoots.","Great so far, awesome zoom, good quality and sharpness; still playing with some of the features. I've gotten some great bird shots and compliments on a close up of the moon.","PROS:<br />- easy to use, right out the box<br />- battery life better  than expected<br />- great value @ $279.00 from Amazon<br />- lens cover  & neck strap are good  quality<br />- on-screen details help when using function dial<br />- transfer  cable & software included<br />- sharp photos with crisp colors<br />- the impressive zoom feature works smoothly<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Only one.  The software provided  for video replay is on a free-trial basis , and then must  be purchased ($80+).  Perhaps  there is a free shareware  option, but it is unfortunate that free software is not included for video, like it is for photos.<br /><br />ALSO:<br />- BE SURE TO PURCHASE A CLASS 10 DATA CARD, OR YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CAMERA's  PERFORMANCE.<br />- Understand that 60x zoom is significant, and best used with the stability of a bipod/tripod.<br /><br />* * * I am very satisfied with this camera and would  recommend  the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 to friends  and family  without  hesitation.","This Camera is great. If you are looking for a solid affordable camera for advanced picture taking this is the one. There are tons of reviews out there so I won't dive into too much detail. I will just say it is worth it!","i bought this as a birthday present and my husband keeps telling me how great this camera is. i do know the zoom lens is very good","large magnifying lens 60x<br />focus while zooming<br />allows adjustment of focus and SLR cameras<br />not interchangeable lens fixed<br />internal memory of 4 gb<br />has all the modes and effects of a point and shoot camera<br />easy to use<br />comes with protective lens cap, battery and strap<br />manual in multiple languages<br />packed in its original box.<br />the display is not moveable<br />brings optical viewfinder.<br />Recommended for intermediate photograph experience<br /><br />gran lente de 60x de aumento<br />enfoca mientras se hace zoom<br />permite ajustes de enfoque como camaras reflex<br />de lente fijo no intercambiable<br />la memoria interna de 4 gb<br />tiene todos los modos y efectos de una camara apunta y dispara<br />facil de usar<br />viene con tapa protectora de lente, bateria y correa<br />con manual en multiples lenguajes<br />empacada en su caja original.<br />la pantalla es fija<br />trae visor optico.<br />recomendada para el fotografo de experiencia intermedio","Good camera for all around outdoor use. Better if optical image stabilization at higher zoom levels was improved. Could also be improved in low light autofocus locking on at higher zoom levels in incandescent lighting.  All other functions mostly very good for price range. Overall  nice camera with many excellent features.","JUST CAME BACK FROM TRIP.  THIS CAMERA IS AMAZING.  MUCH TO LEARN BUT THE AUTOMATIC SETTING CAN DO MOST OF WHAT IS NEEDED.  PICTURES AND VIDEO AT THE SAME TIME.  VERY FAST FOCUSING AAND FAST ZOOM.. PICTURE STABILIZED VERY WELL.","The features of this camera are outstanding from the fantastic picture quality to the extraordinary 60x zoom lens to the HD video. So easy to use.","For the money this camera cant be beat. My wife and I take a lot of wild life photos. This camera at its low price is a lot of bang for the buck. I have purchased two of these one for each of us as we like them that well.","It is a nice product in it's category, wide angle to super tele in one lens. I compared it to mirror less Samsung NX2000with 20-50mm and 50-200mm lenses, and DSLR camera 18-200mm, looking for reasonable quality photos.<br />The camera is big, almost the size of DSLR. Too big for alternate camera.<br />Pictures in a sunny day the images were nice, but a bit soft. In a room (without flash) the camera enhanced the color and brightness, to look like a picture that processed using Photoshop, In dark room it was much worst.<br />The Samsung NX2000 that has bigger sensor, was much more accurate, and the pictures, were much better, no blurry photos. The touch screen/screen resolution made it nice experience.<br />The real deal is when you look at the pictures, when you send them to print. it was obvious that the Panasonic was not good enough, the Samsung NX2000 was on the edge, and both could not be compared to the DSLR.<br />The NX2000 and the DSLR were almost equal in outdoor sunny day photograpy, but the Panasonic quality was not there.<br />Inside the house the differences could be seen especially in lower light. In Zooms beyond 200 you need a tripod, using the Panasonic in ~600nn zoom, it was hard to stay on the object, the Samsung with 50-200mm with 2x digital zoom, and 1.5x factor, was much easier to use.<br /><br />I graded the Panasonic with  3 stars, as it is reasonably priced for whatever you get. For $200 (or less) more The NX 2000 with 2 lenses is a better deal.<br />The problem is that when you take a photo, and you want to get the best results, and the image is not good, sometimes you can not duplicate that moment.","I've had the Lumix FZ70 camera for all of two days, and so far I am thrilled with the experience of owning it. The default iA setting produces sharp photos and videos, far superior to my Samsung Galaxy 2 (phone), iPhone 4, and assorted cheap 16MP Canon and Nikon cameras. The picture quality is comparable to and possibly even better than from the Canon 16MP D5100 that costs more than twice as much. Some people may be put off by its light weight and plastic body; it feels solid enough for my needs.  The camera works well in low light, occasionally I got a warning to pop open the flash. I simply pressed a button to do that, and viola the flash fired without requiring any setting changes. Because it is light, compact, yields quality results and is not expensive I am likely to pack it on every trip.","This was my fourth Panasonic Lumix camera - I have stepped up from one of the first Bridge cameras that they offered, and I loved them. That is until, I got this one. My last camera is the DMC-FZ100. I wanted the upgraded zoom and megapixels. Let me say that the camera does have good points. The weight of the camera is a nice beefy feeling, and makes you aware that you have a camera in your hands. The zoom is INCREDIBLE! Wow,,,it almost breaks my heart to return it because the zoom is so amazing.<br />There is a hot shoe for an external flash. That is about where my \"WOW factor\".<br />Panasonic made a decision to leave items off of this camera items that had a GREAT purpose and now they are gone. Things like the tilt screen,,,the external MIC plug, the macro setting on the setting wheel is gone, and now must be found in the setting menu (it's easy to find, but it used to be easier to just turn the setting wheel). But the tilt screen gone? Why? Having a bridge camera is the reason why folks like me LOVE having a tilt screen. Most of us are amateur photographers, we LIKE the tilt screen! We don't want to manipulate the different lenses,,,many don't like having to mess with manual focus or settings to control many things. I for one like the ability to change my settings manually,,,but,,,I'm also only 5ft tall, I can't get many shots that taller folks can get. But, give me a tilt screen and I can hold the camera up in the air, tilt the screen down, and see what I want for a decent picture,,,that has been taken away.<br />That being said,,,I could live with it when I saw the zoom ability! I loved it!!! I could see birds hiding in trees from quite a distance! WOW - I was a happy shutter bug! Then I started to use the camera. The zoom focus was sluggish and super slow (it was not supposed to be this way). I played around with the settings, and was hoping that this would change, it didn't. But, I dealt with it, and started taking pictures,,,the back screen was almost invisible in bright sunlight, so I switched to the view finder. Getting my full view was a bit difficult for me, but I got the shots that I wanted. It was a clear, bright sunny day, not a cloud in the sky and spring cherry tree blooms were screaming for their picture to be taken. Out of 128 pictures taken from my walk, over half had to be deleted. This was an anomaly that had never taken place in my photoshop menu before. The ones that I did keep, all had to be manually adjusted for clarity. I was upset. I had such high expectations for this model camera. I was willing to give up certain items, in a swap for that awesome zoom capability, but the quality that was lacking in the photos themselves, was just not worth it. Many people have raved at this model, and the pictures that it takes. Perhaps I just got a bad camera? I don't know. I cannot be sure. And, I'm not willing to take that chance. I will be waiting for a different brand camera, to arrive on the market place in March. It will cost much more, but, at this point, I'd rather spend more money, and get everything that I want in a camera.","The capabilities of this camera come across as almost too good to be true.<br />I'm glad to report that Lumix have done a great job.<br />This camera performs really well in multiple conditions.<br />Excellent value for money","I bought this camera for shooting video, the lens and quality are great, the price was perfect for what I needed. I only shoot with Panasonic, video or photo and have never had a problem. and that's been for at least 25 years.","This is a great camera for the level just below the SLR.  It does not allow lens to be changed but it has a very wide range for zooming.  In fact the tele is so long that one must use a tripod unless it is in the brightest of light.  The zoom feature is on a toggle switch and not like SLR which would be on the lens.  Therefore, it is a little slower to change focal length.  The glass monitor is pretty large and bright.  The pictures are sharp as you should expect.  I am no connoisseur, just a hobbyist so I cannot give you a very sophisticated review on the optics.  Be aware that this camera, unlike many Lumix camera, does not carry the Leica lens designation.  On the other hand, that really isn't that important these days, from what I hear.  All in all, it is a versatile camera for those wanting a little more than a point and shot with a goodly wide range from wide angle to zoom.","Have taken several pics in last 4-5 days and besides at first not knowing much about the camera it has done a great job as I learn more about all its abilitys. I figure i will only like it better as i Learn more about it.....I would recommend to friend.","Yo-<br /><br />This replaces my 'old' Lumix DMC-FZ60 and gives me a greatly improved wider and way longer lens distance with somewhat better picture quality.<br /><br />This is not a small camera - has look and feel of a good SLR at a much more reasonable price point.<br /><br />I have and will continue to recommend this fine camera to all interested folks.","I really like the FZ70 especially the super wide angle and extra zoom in the lens and now priced around $300. The super wide angle is rather unique in a super zoom and great for landscapes and indoor shots. The F2.8 at wide angle allows for pretty good low light images. It's rare to see really wide angle in any lens but it does present a problem finding a lens hood that will work at extreme wide angle. The FZ70 is really a stripped down version of the more expensive FZ150/FZ200 with a much bigger zoom lens, different sensor, and missing many extra important features which an experienced image taker expects. These features are nice to have but really not necessary features for the beginner or someone like myself with other cameras.<br /><br />The FZ70 is very easy to hold and still snap sharp images or take excellent video with its separate video button. The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is fair but not large or as bright as the more expensive models such as the FZ200.  It's good enough for bright light or low light but not great.<br /><br />I think this camera is aimed mainly for the beginner or anyone considering buying a dSLR but not prepared to spend the hundreds or thousands for extra lenses beyond the kit lenses included with most dSLR.  It appealed to me for the wide angle and extra zoom. The FZ70 will take macro images but it not nearly as good as any dSLR or MFT (micro four thirds cameras)<br /><br />The image stabilization on the FZ70 is outstanding just like the FZ150/FZ200. I was able to get sharp hand held images at 60X zoom most of the time. It should be impossible to do that but with some extra bracing, the sharp images were close to all of the time.  I think the Panasonic FZ150/FZ200 has the best image quality for the bridge cameras but there is not a huge difference. The FZ70 images are very good and sometimes breathtaking. I checked out an assortment of wide angle to full zoom images and was amazed just how good they were.  An example....I took an image of a house 1/5 of a mile from the camera, hand held at full zoom. I could almost see the individual granules in the shingles and individual leaves in the trees behind the house.  I can't do that with my Canon 60D dSLR and $600 zoom lens.  I recently took the FZ70 along with an Olympus OMDEM5 with a Panasonic 14-140, that combination cost 6X the FZ70 to the local zoo. I used the FZ70 for the wide angle images and the extreme zoom images. I captured in sharp detail, all the animals in their habitat as if I was right next to them. The OMD allowed capturing images through any cages or fencing, something that is nearly impossible to do with the FZ70. The EVF for the OMD is vastly superior which you would expect, which made image taking much easier with that camera. It also had touch controls and more adjustment capable but is not as user friendly as the FZ70.  So how did the images compare?  Amazing close in sharpness which was very unexpected. The OMD captured much more detail and better color, but you expect that with a larger sensor and better lens.<br /><br />Is the camera easy to use?....extremely easy. 100 times easier than my OMD or 60D.  The setup is easy, just turn the dial to ia and press the shutter ½ way to focus and then press all the way. When you grip the camera and use the EVF, your images will be vastly improved over your phone or LCD compact camera.<br /><br />What about all those 1 or 2 star reviews you may have noticed?  Each of those reviews has pointed out some deficiency which the reviewer experienced with the camera. I believe most of it is unfamiliarity with the camera rather than a defect. An example:  1. blurry images=hand shake during exposure or speed too slow, using full zoom in too low of light...solution, use flash or raise the ISO . 2.  Audio noise when zooming...at full zoom the camera's microphone amplifies sound especially at full zoom. 3. Slow startup...big zoom needs time under a second to set itself.  4. Missing features.....to keep cost low, unneeded features not included with this camera.  5. Cheap build...Mostly plastic... To keep camera light, inexpensive and durable, plastic is the way to go. Metal frames add a lot of weight and cost and defeat the purpose of easy to carry around camera. My OMD is much smaller but also much heavier with it all metal framework. I can take images in very wet conditions something not recommended with the FZ70 but who wants to take pictures in the rain? It does help in humid or dusty conditions.<br /><br />If you do not want to spend much over $300, the FZ70 is a great deal. If you have some extra money, I think the FZ200 is the way to go but it is missing the extra zoom and wide angle, but the FZ200 is more compact and takes very good images, video and is a little better in low light. If you want the best images and videos possible in a bridge camera you may want to consider the new Panasonic FZ1000 and/or Sony RX10. These cameras with large sensors and larger lens, cost under $1000 but provide much better low light images and video that comes close to dSLR quality. These cameras are larger and heavier than the FZ70 but smaller and lighter than a dSLR. It is worth considering if you have the budget. If you like just automated settings, big zoom, the FZ70 is a great choice.  Read the manual first it's online. Basic and Advanced. If you have a tablet, who doesn't, it's an easy to read PDF. If that puts you to sleep get the camera first and wait until you need to know how to do more complicated things.","This is the first camera of any sort that approaches the performance I want. It can take handheld night pictures of the sky that rival telescopes. It takes pictures that are worthy of being taken and printed. I hope I never have to replace this camera. A few minor shortcomings, but insignificant compared to performance.","We bought a FZ-40 3 years ago. This is an improved, updated version with a hot shoe, one more f stop plus the longer zoom although the FZ-40 was ample. It will never be a replacement for my Canon DSLR and white lens but it is a perfect walkabout camera. The card works but needs to be a Class 10.","I was considering getting the Nikon 520 due to it's slightly higher resolution but got this instead because of the much longer focal length zoom. I am impressed, and very glad I got this camera! The 60x zoom is fantastic for wildlife, and the image stabilization system works very well. I have taken handheld shots of the moon with decent results. The very wide angle end of the focal range is great for indoor social shots. The 'intelligent Auto' setting is just amazing and the autofocus is very customizable and very fast.","I had been searching for a new camera for some time.  This camera does almost everything I want in a new camera.  Since it came from Amazon, every aspect of the purchase came off without a hitch.","This is a very nice camera.  The only problem I have with it is, when you blow up a wide angle shot it comes out fuzzy.","This camera was purchased for a disabled person who has tendency to drop things.  I have a friend who purchased this and she is a semi professional photographer....she suggested that I buy this for this person.","I wanted a camera that had the functions of a SLR and the ease of point and shoot when I didn't feel like messing with buttons.This fit the bill. Has taken lovely photos, many from great distances and the shots were very clear.","Taking pictures of objects at a distance is no problem for this camera. I already own a digital SLR camera and a 300mm zoom lens, but this approximates 600mm optical (1200mm digital) zoom, which is amazing! Holding the camera still at maximum zoom is always an issue - you need a tripod to get a clear picture, but when the conditions are right you can get that perfect shot with this camera. (And it is so much lighter than my digital SLR!)","I have been a professional photographer since 1983 and I never get excited by any non-professional cameras.  It seems like there are always too many compromises with them.  Now imagine a 20 to 1200 mm lens that you can take to a concert, sports games, etc. that focuses fast at any zoom level.  The panoramic feature is better than my pro camera (actually use this camera to do interiors to make good money with it).  If you want a great camera at an unbelievable price for all of the features it has, then this camera is for you.  It has a flash mount so I bought a good Metz flash.","the 60x zoom was the reason for my buying this camera; it turns out to be very good, even though the lens was neither large nor heavy; I took shot of buildings 10km away and got decent results, even though I merely held it in two hands (left holding the front of the zoomed out lens to keep the scene steady while right pushes button), admittedly in bright afternoon light so that the autofocus was able to set a short exposure<br /><br />I have tried various telescopic solutions, Sigma 170-500mm lens with canon performs reasonably without tripod, but is heavy to handle; Samyang 650-1300mm manual lens was not too bad considering the low cost, but lugging it around with tripod severely restricts what one can realistically do; I even have a 6-in astronomical telescope, with attachments to use it with various cameras; a light weight autofocus long zoom is simply much more convenient","This is my third Lumix bridge camera.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Amazing telephoto range that would have cost many thousands $$ on in equivalent DSLR lenses.<br />- Good resolution for most of us non-professionals.  I have enlarged to 20\"x 30\" and would grade print resolution quality a 85%...pretty good for a home wall picture but won't be acceptable for a billboard in Times Square.<br />- Even though its larger and heavier than its predecessors, its still much lighter than an equivalent DSLR.<br />- FINALLY FINALLY has standard size filters.<br /><br />CONS<br />- Terrible controls.  Everything hinges upon the wheel - turn the wheel, click the wheel.  Especially difficult when one is in manual mode and manual focus.  Then the wheel is used for exposure as well as for focusing and its a nuisance to keep the wheel switched to the desired purpose.  The controls force the user to concentrate on the controls and not the subject.  Much better to have separate controls for these 3 MAJOR variants, or at a minimum, a separate button to switch between purposes.<br />- Exposure compensation button has been removed - its now difficult to find and use.<br />- confusing screen display.  The simulated analog wheel is confusing to understand, and occupies a far bigger proportion of the display than it should - it blocks out the very subject that one is trying to photograph.<br />- The noise level in dark conditions is just NOT acceptable.<br /><br />PANASONIC, for future models:-<br /><br />- Please increase the size of the cmos.<br />- Please improve noise.<br />- Please change controls (how about 2 of the previous 'joystick'-type buttons side-by-side for Aperture and S Speed, and wheel (without preset clicks/graduations) for focus.<br />- PLEASE make the display flexible - let the user include/exclude information and placement.<br />- PLEASE size the filter threads so that a UV filter AND a polarizing filter will not show up in the corners of the picture.<br />- Please include a lens hood.<br />- Revert the menu dial back to previous configuration - MUST have exposure compensation easily accessible.<br />- Please charge more for camera but include those features.","I am a retired art teacher who focused on so much other media in the arts.  This is my very first true camera to explore new options,  I love it!!  It is a little more involved than a traditional point and shoot camera. Yet, it is not overwhelming to learn.  Anyone with a sincere photo interest should start with this camera. It is a great camera to start learning the camera basic mechanics  and practice artistic subject matter and concepts. Buy it and then let the fun begin!!  You won't regret it for one minute...","I purchased this Panasonic LUMIX Digital Camera for my husband, as a Christmas gift.

Not only for the specifications that I wanted, but also, for the affordable price, that included accessories, this Digital camera...has met our expectations. At this time...we are still 'working with all its' capabilities'...am amazed. We live in South Texas, and have not yet, explored all of what Nature has to offer...we are excited to venture out!","the pictures are asome, the zoom is the best, and have take some full moon pictures that you can see tha craters. the best camera i have bought. if you are insterest in good pictures and don't have the skills to be a profesional taking pictures this s the camera you need.","We shoot wildlife shots and love the stabilization and zoom. Did not expect the digital function from 60 to 120x to be usable but provides very good results.  I did not intend to use the digital zoom but did so by accident and was amazed at the quality when compared to the optical at 60x. Worth every penny and easy to use for the novice","I am very pleased with this purchase. It is an excellent device. It has worked very well. I recommend this camera to others people.","Nothing I don't like about it, range is the best...great resolution, battery life is fantastic, love that you can turn the camera on before removing the lens cap without grinding the motor like on the Nikon P 500!  UGH.  Anyway, it's really nice quality and very durable.  Am having a ball with it!","First I have to say I am not a professional photographer, but an amateur that usually likes to shoot landscapes. I bought this camera because I wanted to take pictures at concerts I go to and getting seats close to the stage for this reason is getting to be so expensive, and with other point and shoots, it just didn't work. Although I've had this camera since November, I had not been able to use it. I was let in at the AMA and People's Choice Awards but was told not to use it. (I did not want to be the person kicked out of an awards show). I finally used it for the first time at Maroon 5's NYE show in Vegas. It was my first time to shoot manual at a concert. I was about 300 feet away from the stage, I just set the widest aperture it would let me at whatever zoom I had it, which was I think 4, ISO was between 400-800. I was very pleased with the images I got. On the head-shoulder shots, you could see Adam Levine's frown lines and crows feet, no noise, it was awesome.<br /><br />My frustration was in uploading the images. I shot RAW but it said RW2 file and I could not upload the images into iPhoto, Lightroom or Bridge. I ended up converting the images into DNG files to upload them into Lightroom and converted them again into jpegs, which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW. Any input on this issue is greatly appreciated. Until I get the update to solve this, I will be shooting RAW and JPEG. I will try to shoot videos next time as we'll.","I was very happy with this purchase. The camera works as expected and the video and photos taken are really great. I read reviews and it met all my expectations. Friends and family have been amazed at the quality of the photos taken with this camera. I really have been really happy with the wind noise reduction when taking videos and the ability to stay in focus when zooming in video mode.","I had earlier purchased a Panasonic 18X zoom and was favorably impressed with its optics and functionality.  I waited for the next Panasonic, even while other powerful zooms made their appearance, because I had a hunch it would be worthwhile to do so.  Indeed it was, I brought FZ70 with expedited shipping, as I was heading out to SF to see my son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren and I wanted to be able to test it out during the trip.<br /><br />My son, as a surprise gift, bought my wife and myself tickets aboard a tour ship that went out into the SF harbor to watch the America's Cup.  Our distance ranged from 1/3 to 3/4 miles from the racing craft and the zoom gave me exceptional photos.  Not only did the image stabilization take care of my tremors, it also took care of the rolling of the tour ship!  I have a collection of truly impressive clear pictures that I only wish I could share with you.  This camera is truly an exceptional value.","If you are looking for a high quality point and shoot camera with great zoom capacity and ease of use, this is the one for you. This is my second Panasonic Lumix point and shoot and it does not disappoint. I use my DSLR for professional shots for huge blow ups but have even sold some of the shots taken with my Lumix's up to 16x20's with great clarity. This little camera has great features like star bursts and sunset presets...you can even adjust the lighting with the presets which my other Lumix could not do. It is a great camera to take on vacation because it even does panoramic shots with ease. Good price for the features and for this much zoom too.","This cam is a very good electronic device. The incredible zoom and the quality of the pictures makes satisfied of this choice.","As expected, cheaper than the competition and as good as the competition. Very good when you travel and easy to use.","I always purchase a Panasonic Lumix camera because I really like the ones I have purchased in the past but the FZ70 has a few changes from my FZ50 that I can't say I care for.  The main complaint is the fact that every time I want to remove the memory card or replace the battery with a fresh one, I have to totally remove it from my tripod!  I know that in the past when I would have to replace the battery with a fresh one, I was able to open the door without removing the camera.  Sometimes, there  wouldn't have been enough time to remove the camera from the tripod.........the shots were coming fast and I would have lost some of the shots if I had to do that.<br /><br />I miss the \"flipping the screen\" option that is on the FZ50.  I also would rather have a \"slide on/off\" button like on the FZ50 than the type that is on the FZ70.<br /><br />Something I have discovered that I do like....I have now been able to take videos of the sunset with out that \"white light\" line or I think it is called light sheer.  Always before when the \"white light\" started to appear I would have to stop recording because the white line appeared in the video........now I can continue to record because it NEVER shows up.<br /><br />On the other hand, when trying to take a still of the sunset......the shot looks perfect before you press the button but when it displays the photo taken, the light is so bright that the shot isn't any good and the photo does the same even when I decrease the exposure to the max!  What I gained in one area I lost in another between my fz50 and  fz70!<br /><br />I am not a professional photographer and am still trying to figure out some of the features on the camera.  I am a hands on person and learn better by experimenting with the camera than reading the instruction manual.  I guess I will have to post more as I learn and experiment with the camera.","I have been a fan of the Panasonic Lumix Cameras for years. This is my third one, and it's a beauty. Also it uses the same memory cards and battery that the DMC-FZ40 did. The 60X zoom is amazing.","I will start this by saying that I am a big Panasonic fan and have owned several 12/16 mp P&S high zoom cameras (DMC-ZS20 for example).  I ordered this looking for a good super zoom unit.  I checked other reviews and noted the mixed ratings, but greedy for \"zoom\" ordered it anyway.<br /><br />\"Bad News\" is much like what others have reported in that you are paying for zoom and one of the \"give backs\" is in the processor.  In order to get really clear pictures I find that I need to use my monopod to steady the camera if using more than a modest amount of zoom.  It is early days and I am still learning to use the unit so I will update this as I go.  I also noted that Panasonic does not use a \"named\" lense on this unit like on my other cameras, which may also figure into things. I also am aware that talent may be an issue here too so I want to tread lightly here for the moment.<br /><br />The \"Good News\" is that it's a Panasonic.  It feels good, albeit a little large and the price via Amazon was very good.  The camera feels solid and the controls are well laid out. The view finders do a good job and Ai mode normally does a very acceptable job.<br /><br />I want to love this camera, but it is too early to tell if getting the zoom was worth it.<br /><br />02/23/2014 Update:<br />I've had more experience with the FZ70 now and it really grows on you.  As recommended in other reviews, I've added a UV filter and a lens hood now that there is one for the camera.  Not being the best at camera manipulation, I found that working through the manual with the camera in hand is a big help.  I also found that using the flash indoors helped with photo sharpness.  I am also in process of working through and testing my camera setups to be sure, now that I am more familar with the beast, that I am achieving what I thought I wanted.  In the end there is just no substitute for using the camera in a range of situations as, while it is no DSLR, it is a whole lot more than a mere point and shoot camera.  I freely admit that most of my \"issues\" with the camera reside with me, and by working with the camera I am learning to appreciate all it has to offer.  At the price point that I bought the camera for, I am really glad I have it.<br /><br />06/13/2014 Update:<br />I wanted to report that I went to Everglades National Park a few days ago and had a perfect opportunity to give the camera a good outdoor test.  While at the main visitor center I was able to get some great shots of gators at a distance.  The zoom was incredible as I was able to get some really close in shots of the gator's eyes and hide.  Really a wonderful experience.  It was a bright day so the UV filter helped especially when taking close in pictures of fish in shallow water.  The camera did very well.  Earlier I tried out my wife's Cannon D40 to get a feel for a big DSLR.  For me I have to say that I prefer the FZ70 as it's a bit smaller and a lot lighter.  On the downside at zoom the picture softens a little (lens quality?) but is still pretty darn good for anything the average picture taker would want to do.  The more I use this camera, the more I like it.  At a $1,000 less that the Cannon/lens, I'm feeling pretty smug.","An outstanding camera at an excellent price.  Just as good as my professional Canon.  I am surprised at how good it is.  Would highly recommend.","For a light weight digital camera it is good for some events and not so much for others.  I've only had this camera for a month as a backup to my higher end cameras.  From the lower zoom to about the 500 mm zoom the photos are good when shot in RAW (JPG starts to get fuzzy and grainy early in the 30x zoom range and because I take a lot of nature and landscape photos the 500 to 1200 (60x range) the photos quality diminishes. I'm comparing the quality with higher-end DSLR cameras/lens and that might not be fair since this is not promoted as comparable. Close up and objects not more than 100-150 feet the camera is good.  I would not recommend this camera if you are looking for overall great optics and low pixelation (the effect caused by zooming in on a photo making pixels visible). Shooting in the RAW mode does help however it uses up a lot of memory and battery (fewer photos on a memory card and battery drainage).  I've been shooting since the early 1970 (film) and digital higher end DSLR's from the very early 2000's.  I'll keep experimenting to see if I can improve the photo quality to the point I would like it to be... but until then \"It's O.K.\" (3 stars) is the best I can give it.","Still need to learn how to use all the features but so far we like it.  (Again word requirement stupid.....why don't you guys just send out words/sentences and just let us pick the closest comments to our real experience.............did the people who design this software also work on the President's health care website?","so far the camera acomplish what i expected, I wish it could have a manual zoom. may be later I can have a better oppinion on it","before purchasing i read all of the professional reviews that downplayed the camera, so i set out to try in the store the time to focus at the longest range of the lens for all of the candidates for purchase.  tried the Cannon FX-50 (recalled at Best Buy) ,. the Nikon P520 and the Sony HX-300,  i couldn't get my hands on the Fuji HS-50 EXR, The Panasonic Lumix FZ-70 was the quickest to focus and while holding with one hand had the steadiest picture at the extreme zoom.  for the FZ-70 that was 1200 plus the digital zoom. the others were not good competitors at quick focus and holding the focus while hand held at the max zoom.  I was really hoping to test the Fuji with the dual mode focus.  What isn't in the published specs of the FZ-70 is that the FZ-70 has 200MB built in memory.  Used the Camera for holiday photos and all were great, and almost never used the flash because it wasn't necessary.  Speaking of the flash,  there is also undocumented, that the flash is indeed a pop-up, however it is a manual pop-up. meaning when it needs the flash it has a message in the view finder or the LCD screen to open the flash.  the Flash doesn't pop-up automatically when needed like other cameras.  The first time this happened, i was very tempted to take it back.  however i realized that when in a situation where i knew a flash may be needed, i could just open it up.  I have experimented with some of the special features while reading the manual.  let me say first off that it works great in full auto mode  iA mode.  however the special features are wondrous.  one i really like is the \"single color\" mode where you can take a photo of a person wearing a ball cap, and make the ball cap the only thing in color with the rest of the photo in BW.  The manual is huge, since there are so many capabilities of this camera.  I downloaded to may tablet and read a feature and try it on the camera.  this is going to be a long process.  Bottom line - i think the professional reviewers were paid by another company to push their camera, and am very glad i tested all of the contenders before purchasing.  One recommendation no matter which camera you buy,  get the fastest SDHC/XC card you can find.","If you plan on making 16 x 20 prints this isn't the camera for you.  You loose a lot to get that amazing zoom range.  For most folks it is a wonderful value.  Enjoy?","Heavy in overall feeling and the Panasonic Lumix point-and-shoot that I currently have (14 MP) performs far better with both natural light and low light. the DMC-FZ70 lens comes with a cheap plastic lens cover that - unless one is very cautious with applying - could easily scratch the lens - Panasonic could do far better with a different - and yes, not cheap - lens cover. I returned it because of these above factors. the beauty of purchasing via Amazon. No problems.","My son absolutely loves his camera.  It has many extras on it that I almost wished that I would have ordered one for my other son as well!","The camera was larger than expected, But once I started using the different options I was amazed by the quality of the pictures and ease of use. I can't wait for my next vacation.","For years, I've debated what camera to take birding. The choice is between being a BIRDER, that is, using binoculars to look at birds, and being a BIRD PHOTOGRAPHER, more interested in the great photo than spotting everything. Fortunately, I have had the good luck to travel with photographers, leaving me free to spend time looking. I've considered getting the gear necessary to take good photos, but the investment, both in dollars and weight, is significant.<br /><br />Finally, a camera comes along made for people like me. It is small and light enough to carry around all day, yet capable of taking great photos. The lens extends to provide 60x optical zooming, coupled with superior image stabilizing firmware that I find myself snapping away. If the birds are distant, well, you at least have a record shot. However, when you have one reasonably close, you may get a real keeper.<br /><br />I love this camera and it will be part of my birding equipment from now on.<br /><br />The only minor complaint I have is that it doesn't seem to have an option to recharge the battery using the USB cable, meaning that you have to pack yet another battery charger on a long trip.","I even dropped it down a 10 foot cliff with me behind it and it worked fine after the fall. However I do not recommend this. The 60x zoom hand held pictures are amazing. Easy to operate","The same problem we had when the FZ100 came out. The pictures were very soft (fuzzy), not good detail at full zoom. Then we purchased an FZ150 and the detail is excellent. We wanted the longer zoom, but were disappointed in the results. We sent it back. It seems when they increase the MP's along with the zoom, it's not a good match...","A very nice camera. Very versatile  with the super zoom. Also very impressed with some of the special easy to use special effects like the background blur as well as others. Wish it had the adjustable viewer screen but I knew that before I purchased it..Fits well in the hand. Simple fast control buttons for the most used functions..","everything i hoped it would be. Love this camera. the big Zoom with image stabilization is a dream come true","First thing I wanted to test was the zoom and image stabilization on this camera.  I'm used to carrying around big DSLRs but they require very large lenses to get the sort of zoom you can get on this camera.  Now, the OIS on this is pretty good, but it won't let you hand-hold a shot at full zoom, especially if you're not in anything less than full daylight.  I was able to get some usable shots by resting my hands against a solid object (doorframe for example), so a full-on tripod isn't required to use full zoom, just a way to stabilize yourself as well.<br /><br />Feature-wise, this camera has everything you've come to expect in fixed-lens superzooms.  Several automatic and scene modes, but also a fairly usable manual mode.  I enjoyed using macro mode, something that's not easy to do on a DSLR without a specific lens or accessories.  The panorama mode works very well and is actually my favorite feature on this camera.  I haven't extensively worked with the video, but from casually playing with it, it seems pretty solid too.<br /><br />My only complaint, and this is really true with all cameras of this type, the image quality pales in comparison to even bottom-level DSLRs or DSLRs a few generations old.  Anything that's not shot in bright daylight gets noisy pretty fast.  It's a current limitation of the platform, if anything, but a very important limitation.","After having a small Sony Cybershot with only a 3X zoom (which actually took great pics), I decided to upgrade to another point and shoot with more zoom.  Looked around and researched similar cameras from Canon, Fuji, Sony, and Nikon, but decided on the Panasonic due to the wide angle feature.  I'm not a pro and probably will never use half of the features of this camera or even understand what they all mean.  I just want to put it in auto and go take pics.  Have already taken several hundred pics and I am very, very satisfied with this camera.  It takes awesome landscapes in low power/wide angle (my favorite pics to take) with awesome colors, crisp and sharp.  The zoom is phenominal and even with a tripod or monopod, you do lose some quality when zoomed all the way out, but still are good pics.  Although slightly larger than the other cameras, I like the size and ease of handling.  Really, the only negative I can think of is finding your way through the different menus and what all of the buttons and dials do... a little confusing, but I'm sure reading the electronic manual and using the camera over time will make it easier.  For the price, this camera is excellent and I recommend it, just don't expect it to be perfect in all areas and take pics like a high end camera. It's a point and shoot super-zoom that costs a couple hundred, to that end, it does an outstanding job IMO.","Panasonic's DMC-FZ70 Lumix mega-zoom camera is a terrific product that captures fantastic images under a variety of conditions and with impressive specs and performance that exceeds the affordable pricing this particular model can usually be found for.<br /><br />The standout feature is the 60x optical zoom that extends quickly with nice, smooth action.  The zoom alone has made the FZ70 a first option amongst my selection of cameras as of late and the image quality of photos taken past 50x is very impressive with sharp, detailed coloring.  One thing to keep in mind - once zooming past 10x a tripod is highly recommended for best results.  Overall I've been very pleased with final image results.  The MOS sensor does a fine job in reducing noise and with a max image size of 4608x3456, prints can be made up to 34x29 cm.<br /><br />Other things I like about the FZ70:<br /><br />+The image processor does a great job with full-resolution continuous shooting at 9 fps or 5 fps with autofocus.<br />+Video quality also receives a thumbs-up with shooting resolutions of 1920x1080 @ 60i or 1280x720 at 60p in AVCHD or MP4.<br />+The housing of the stereo microphones reduces wind noise very well.<br />+The 3 inch LCD is gorgeous and vibrant but in daylight conditions the electronic view finder (with diopter adjustment) is appreciated.<br />+The included battery is good for around 400+ shots.<br />+The weight at 1.3 lbs is very reasonable when considering the zoom range of the lens.<br />+Camera is quick and responsive and can go from power-on to shot taken in under 2 seconds.<br />+The beginner friendly 'iA' mode takes great pictures.  Most users can probably stick with this mode for the majority of shots but there are plenty of other manual settings to experiment with once you're ready for it.<br /><br />One final tip - the one feature I wish this camera had is wifi for file management purposes but you could always purchase the new wifi enabled SD cards if desired.","Update (4-4-14): I took this camera on an international trip & used it indoors, in a cave, in fog & while on a bus. This camera produced better pictures than my friend's Rebel.  This FZ70 is bulky & gets weighty over the course of the day, but when going between distance & zoom, and between speed shots & low light shots, it is hard to beat.  The only thing I couldn't do was switch to black & white photos, which would have been cool in the fog.<br />_______________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 is called a bridge camera because it is a step above a point & shoot, but a step below an SLR camera.  As a traveler and someone who frequently goes between regular view and zoom for variations of the same shot, a camera like this Lumix \"all-in-one\" continues the best camera to suit my needs because I don't have time or patience to switch lenses, and a lens that can handle regular to zoom on an SLR camera is easily a thousand dollars.<br /><br />The DMC-FZ70 is my third Lumix camera, and each one has gotten progressively better (and larger).  The FZ-70 packs a lot of features, including panoramic and RAW capabilities.  Its functionality in indoor light situations is much better than my previous Lumix cameras.  As with my other Lumix cameras, I never use a tripod, and the stability feature of this camera is as good as the previous models.  To stabilize, I wrap the shoulder strap around my left hand & hold the camera taut.<br /><br />Outdoors, full zoom is marvelous. On some of my pictures at full zoom, using the standard camera settings, I could see a tiny bit of noise, but overall, the camera really performs well in outdoor settings. Performance-wise, the camera's colors consistently look good and the camera consistently produces pictures that look natural.<br /><br />The Lumix, does have its limitations. Low light still pictures with no zoom are your best bet for a good shot. Indoor movement (gym situations) with zoom is difficult to achieve. Using a flash will help, but you will have to play with your camera speeds (ie, don't rely on the standard camera settings).  If you can't use a flash indoors, take time to play with your camera in different settings to see what works best for your particular situation.  With time & practice, you will get to know your camera & you will get the shots you want.<br /><br />For its price and features, this Lumix DMC-FZ70 is hard to beat.  It is certainly worth the money.","I like the view finder - sometimes it works better than the display - especially in bright light. The increased functionality of having manual controls makes it more flexible than an automatic camera.  The long zoom is also a big plus when taking wildlife shots.","I purchased this F70 for myself for Christmas after exhaustively researching all the \"super zoom\" cameras I could find, including all of the reviews on this site. If you're considering this camera, know that you probably won't find it in any but the largest camera stores and the online price varies widely. Last week on Amazon it varied from $249.00-349.00, and that's on the one site! Needless to say, I waited until it was $249. I’m not a professional photographer so this isn’t a technical review, but I’ve been taking pictures for about 50 years, first with Kodak roll film box cameras, then a twin lens reflex, then a series of manual 35mm cameras (no light meter), and culminating in my ultimate 35mm, a Nikon FM. I’ve used various digital cameras that my wife owned, including a Minolta and a Canon ELPH. Until I bought my wife a Canon SX50 last xmas, I was not ready to give up my Nikon but the Canon astounded me with its picture quality, small size, light weight, and of course that 50X optical zoom (effectively 24-1200mm). After selling my Nikon, I was about set to buy another SX50 for myself when I saw the Panasonic FZ70. What attracted me was the 20mm wide angle and 60X optical zoom as well as the manual control options. I was turned off by some of the reviews regarding picture quality especially compared to the SX50 but after re-reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance and ordered it and I’m glad I did. I set it on a tripod and photographed a tree about a half mile away, first at wide angle then at 60X zoom and another at 50X zoom. And I did the same thing with her Canon. Despite tripod shake and a strong wind blowing the tree, the FZ70 took a remarkably clear shot at 60X. At 50X it actually appeared to have more detail than the Canon when viewed on my computer. I liked the colors with the Canon better but the colors are adjustable on the Panasonic so I could probably duplicate the results. I wish there was a way to upload the photos so I could show you.  Also, the 20mm on the Panasonic is a real advantage for me because I shoot mostly landscapes and the panoramic feature works as advertised, enabling you to take up to a 360 degree shot in one pass! Close-ups are also astounding, without even enabling a macro feature. As mentioned by another reviewer, the on/off switch does seem flimsy but at least you won’t turn it on or off accidentally. It’s also bigger and bulkier and hard to find a case for – I ended up ordering a Tamrac 5210 from Cameta Camera on Ebay which should fit. If you buy this camera and use a UV filter at all times as I do to protect the lens, follow one reviewer’s recommendation and get a quality multi-coated glass filter like the Sigma, because cheap filters can affect the clarity. I bought a set of Vivitar filters for my wife’s Canon from Digital Goya through Amazon and they seem fine but I opted for the more expensive Sigma for my Panasonic. To summarize, don’t believe everything you read. Different cameras perform differently under different conditions with different settings. Decide what’s important  to you and try several if you can. I’d be perfectly happy with another Canon SX50; it’s a great camera, but I’m glad I took a leap of faith and bought the Panasonic. No more film, no more lens changing, and I sold my Nikon and a Samsung camcorder which more than paid for the Panasonic – I’m a happy camper. If you’re a professional, neither will probably replace your SLR or DSLR or camcorder, but for the rest of us, these open a whole new world of photography.","So you know where I'm coming from: I am not an accomplished photographer - just a mom who loves to great shots of her kids.  For the last few years, I've relied on my Pansonic Lumix F27.  It's a similar \"bridge\" camera, fitting between point and shoot and DSLR, but is now several years behind the times.  I also recently purchased a Panasonic Lumix TS5A, which is a compact waterproof point and shoot.<br /><br />The 60X zoom is what attracted me to the FZ70.  I thought it would help me get great shots of the kids doing their sports, music performances, etc from my seat far up in the stands.  But so far I am unable to get really clear shots at the full zoom length.  I have no doubt that I could get a good shot with a tripod, but it's usually not possible to bring a tripod and claim the aisle at these kind of events. I am getting some very nice shots at about half the zoom length, though.... but I am carrying around the bulk and weight of a 60X zoom, and not being able to use that full range effectively.<br /><br />I am somewhat disappointed in the burst mode of this camera.  It gets up to 9 frames to second.  Since my compact waterproof Panasonic gives me up to 60 frames per second, I just sort of expected that this \"more serious\" camera would at least be in the same ballpark.<br /><br />This camera also had problems with the autofocus when  used on a very cold day (about 10 degrees F).  Perhaps that would happen with any camera though?<br /><br />I will keep using this camera and trying to learn how to maximize its capabilities. It seems wrong that at this point, I prefer my older/lighter Panasonic bridge camera or my new compact waterproof camera to this one.  I'm probably missing something.  It's probably my fault.  It's probably a GREAT camera.  But this amateur is struggling to see the benefits.","I need someone's help with this camera when I do shots at a basketball game I'm not sure of all the settings yet, can someone help I took a lot of pictures (outdoors ) but need help inside. The outdoor shots are great.","Its a good camera, have an excelent resolution and extraordinary zoom, i hope dont have inconvenients and continue using by a good time this camera.","ok a Christmas present for my wife (wink) and its awesome so far.  took it to Christmas brunch and now on our way to dinner. the compliments are great but the usability and pictures are better","This camera is everything I was looking for.  Light weight great zoom no changing lenses.  Only thing is can't figure out how to take a pic without the red flash even if I turn off red eye function. Otherwise LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!","The super long optical zoom, plus the digital zooms (which in the programmable modes lets you shoot the craters on the moon), make this a great camera for people who like to shoot wildlife and scenes that are far away.  I'm still learning some of the changes between this and my last super zoom but overall I am very pleased.","Although this camera is bigger than I wanted, I already have a Canon, I love the quality of the photos, color, sharpness.  It is easy to use and I would recommend it if you dont mind the size.  I have big hands and it fits nicely for me.","I recently bought this to replace a Lumix G3.  My dream has always been a FZ200, but finances do not permit that at this time.  Although the G3 had very, very good image quality and even great video (in good light), a m4/3 or DSLR is an investment item.  You need to invest in lenses which can be very costly, add to that having to carry around extra gear and swapping lenses on the fly.  That being said, let's look at the FZ70.<br />I did some sample shots inside the house in a dimly light room.  Images up to ISO1600 were pretty good for a 1/2.3 sensor.  The wide 20mm lens helps, as does the f2.8 in low light.  The aperture quickly drops as you zoom in on objects.  I  shot some video in the same dim light and objects near the light source are great!  Speckeled noise is much more visible in lower light areas.  AUTO video does a pretty decent job - there is a slight auto-focus noise as the camera focuses during video.  I look forward to using the camera outside in brighter light.  My guess is the camera will perform wonderfully for both stills and video.  The FZ70 60x zoom is a bit much, anything beyond 25x probably needs a tripod.  IT would be nice if you could set a zoom limit.  I will update this as I use the camera more.  For sub $300, I think it's a great value.  Knowledge of a camera's PASM settings will help a great deal here as you can really break through the surface features if this camera and get a lot out of it.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />One Month Later:  This camera needs a lot of light to perform at its best.  (I know, it only has a 1/2.3 sensor...)  It's tough to get really good indoor shots, even with the flash.  Noise is present at 1600 ISO +.  If anyone has suggestions on how to get better indoor images with this camera, please share your advice.  In bright light, the camera excels.  Images are a tad soft, but Auto+ does a great job producing solid images.  I've never seem a camera shoot so well in Auto.  I like AUTO+ because you still have control over some items like exposure.  I read that it is recommended to drop exposure by 1/3.  I've tried this and the results are great.  No blow outs of over-exposing.  I want to \"love\" this camera, but right now I just \"like\" it.  I am hoping to experiment more and get some very good results from this camera, INDOOR and outdoor.","I purchased this camera after seeing one in use on a trip to Costa Rica where it was excellent in capturing birds and monkeys in the forest canopy.  Several features contributed to this.  It has a wide zoom range allowing it to capture both wide views and incredible closeups of distant objects - birds and monkeys in this case.  Additionally it has an effective anti-shake capability, making tripods for long shots not always necessary.","Even for a beginner it is a great choice! The zoom is amazing! The quick shutter speed if great for kids sports.","I am not going to write a lot about specs because they are fully listed at Panasonic's site but maybe I should note a few of the features that made me fall in love with this camera.<br /><br />- Resolution up to 16.1 MP<br />- 60x optical zoom (it's true)<br />- Accepts SD, SDHC and SDXC (just added a 64GB SDXC and it flies)<br />- Rechargeable battery, AC charger, wrist strap and semi-proprietary USB data cable included<br />- Small and light when compared to a full DSLR<br />- Photo in all the formats you'd expect including 360-degree panoramic and 3D and with various preset settings, too many to mention in a brief review<br />- Supports JPEG (DCF/Exif 2.3), RAW, DPOF for photos, MPO for 3D and AVCHD and MP4 for movies<br />- Photo resolution from 480x480 up to 4608x3456<br />- Video from 640x480 to 1920x1080 at 30 fps<br />- Tripod socket and flash horseshoe (there is a built-in flash, of course)<br />- Relatively easy to navigate menus (must invest some time if you're a first time LUMIX user)<br />- Nice image processing capabilities<br />- Several levels of 'ease of use' from nearly full automatic to allowing you to set everything the way you want it.<br /><br />This bridge camera is not 'cheap' in any way except maybe for the price when factoring in the value it provides but, as a bridge, it may underwhelm those who have used DSLRs for years while 'point and shoot' users may find it too big, too complicated and probably too expensive. But, one month later, I can say that I am in love with this camera and I am actually using it in instances where I would normally take shots with a phone or a small point-and-shoot AND in most instances where I would have brought a DSLR before I had a the opportunity to try out this LUMIX.<br /><br />This being my first Panasonic camera of any kind, learning it wasn't easy but, after taking some time getting used to it, it does become 'second nature', eventually. It took me about one month to advance from the basic 'all auto' settings to maybe half-way to 'pro' skills and, not being a professional photographer, I may not advance much farther. I can already take near-perfect HD video with clear stereo sound, macro photos, beautiful low-light shots and, with a tripod, I did a pretty good portrait of the Moon at 60x zoom and max res. I am currently experimenting with a third-party flash and I continue to be impressed by my output's quality and the ease of getting it that way.<br /><br />Of course, not everything is perfect. Yes, it's not a DSLR and it doesn't support Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or 'location', meaning that you will be transferring your work out either through a wire or a card reader adapter and you'll have to make a not of where the photo was taken - I personally don't care much about these features but no everyone is 'me' so it's worth stating it. I also do not<br />like the non-standard USB cable for data transfer but I'm using a card reader anyway so yes, it's bad but not too bad.<br /><br />Not a negative at all because it's customary, but it's worth noting that you need to supply your own carrying case, memory card because the 300MB or so built in won't take you too far.<br /><br />I like this LUMIX a lot and after all these years of juggling between phones and point-and-shoot and DSLRs for 'serious' events or happenings, I may just stick with the 'bridge' because it's so much fun to use while giving me almost everything I could squeeze out of a DSLR and often more: incredible zoom power, movies and microphone quality, flexibility in setting picture format and resolution.","The Lumix DMC-FZ70 right out of the box an amazing point and shoot camera and becomes an even more awesome camera when you really start digging into it.<br /><br />The user interface is simple, fast, and easy to navigate. Anyone who has used a digital camera made in the last three years wont have any issues with it at all.<br /><br />Forgetting to buy a SD card (oops!), I had to limp by for a few days recording everything to the internal memory, which surprisingly was doing quite well keeping up with my ultra happy shutter finger. Of the dozen or so other digital cameras I've used over the years, this Lumix was able to access, load, and save the pictures to the internal memory faster than any other... huge plus!<br /><br />Once I picked up my SD card, I really went crazy snapping shots.<br /><br />The obvious reason for getting the DMC-FZ70 is for it's amazing 60x optical zoom. It totally delivers! Up close, midway, or far out, it handles it all and with amazing clarity. Astonishingly even at 60x the pictures come out clear WITHOUT a bi or tripod.<br /><br />The Lumix DMC-FZ70 provides an awesome midpoint between an SLR and your typical point and shoot that was greatly being overlooked. Couldn't be happier!","This is an upgrade to a Canon superzoom from a few years ago.  If you aren't familiar with them, you might think of them as bigger than a standard compact camera, but without the changeable lenses and big sensors of DSLRs.  They are not just for poor photographers.  Their ability to go from macro (super close) to high zoom levels without a lens change is handy, and image quality is very good.  Even people with DSLRs sometimes keep one in their stash.<br /><br />So, how does the Lumix DMC-FZ70 compare?<br /><br />BUILD<br /><br />Some things never seem to change in electronics, and the standard build of this class of camera is one of them.  It looks very much like the rest.  Still, everything seems to fit together tightly and the housing is sturdy.  My one complaint is that the screen is not moveable.  I find the ability to swivel the screen on my Canon camera extremely useful (high shots, low shots, etc.).<br /><br />LOW LIGHT<br /><br />It is not magical.  In low-light indoor situations, I needed a steady hand to avoid motion blur.  I took a series of identical shots with both cameras and found the the Lumix had vastly better low-light images, with more detail coming through.  While manual settings will give the best results, the auto settings were pretty intelligent.  It does not compare well with DSLRs that I've used, but that is an unfair comparison.  This is the best I've seen a superzoom do with standard indoor lighting.<br /><br />The flash is bright and good at not blowing out images.<br /><br />BRIGHT LIGHT<br /><br />With daylight, images are beautiful and sharp.  Compared to the Canon, the colors are truer.  This is a matter of preference, as it may make some imagery less \"vivid.\"  Thankfully, this can easily be adjusted in photo editing software.<br /><br />One thing that DSLRs do great is bokeh (keep one part of image in focus, while rest is unfocused).  I was able to get a little bit, but nothing very impressive.  On the bright side, having everything in focus is usually ideal for family or documentary photos.<br /><br />ZOOM<br /><br />Wow!  This camera goes from a super wide angle perfect for shooting in small rooms to zooming far away fast.  So fast that I found it a bit hard to get the zoom just right at first.  What a great and useful feature!<br /><br />MACRO<br /><br />Macros are very impressive with the FZ70.  Even with the lens touching an object, I was able to get sharp focus.  This is one thing that a DSLR can't hope to do without an expensive lens just for it.<br /><br />VIDEO<br /><br />Wow again!  I've taken a ton of video with this camera, and it is always impressive.  The processor is able to keep up with the 1080i video at 60 fps with no blur during pans or when recording fast objects.  As with photos, the low-light performance is impressive too.  The audio is not as impressive, but it does the job.  Focus is generally fast and able to keep up, and the use of zoom does not cause a loud motor noise like it does in my old camera.<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS<br /><br />The Lumix DMC-FZ70 is a surprisingly good value.  It works well in low-light and takes videos worthy of all your family memories.  As someone who normally goes straight to Canon, I am surprised by how strongly I am recommending it.","One word to describe this camera: WOW~! I am amazed with its zoom capability. I appreciate it even more after I download the photos to my computer and as I review them, I notice more details that the human naked eyes couldn't even see when taking the photos. It is obviously not a compact camera to accommodate the powerful zoom lens. It is solidly built. I especially love the super wide 20mm lens. Great for party shots when you need to squeeze in a group of people in the frame. Buy it! You will have so much fun using this camera! You might consider becoming a Paparazzi, too. :)","Although I have had this camera for only a few weeks, I must say the FZ70 is one of the best values in digital camera. From here, all references to lens focal length will be in 35 mm film photography equivalent.<br /><br />For about $300, you get a 60X lens that stretches from a heretofore unheard of 20 mm ultra wide to 1200 mm super telephoto, all in a relatively small and light package. Most super zoom cameras have a zoom range of 24X to 50X, and the wide end usually starts at 24 mm or 28 mm. You won't believe how much wider 20 mm is until you compare pictures of the FZ70 with \"lessor\" super zooms taken at the widest setting.<br /><br />If you shoot video, the microphone's sound gathering capability will adjust with the zoom lens's focal length, so that even when you zoom in, you can get good sound from a distance.<br /><br />Other than being an excellent value, the FZ70 gives you the ultimate in convenience. There is no need to haul a whole bag of heavy lenses in order to take different shots. The magic is in the size of the image sensor, which is 1/2.3 inch. This is much smaller than sensors in APS-C or Micro Four-Thirds cameras. But also because of its smaller size, it becomes possible to design a super zoom camera with an astonishing zoom range. If you use a full-frame camera, the zoom range is about 3X to 4X at most before the lens physical size, weight, and cost become prohibitive.<br /><br />So the trade-off is image quality vs. convenience vs. cost. The FZ70 takes, IMHO, excellent pictures and video. It won't do as well in low light situations when compared to cameras with larger sensors, but the pictures and videos are still very good to excellent.<br /><br />I prefer using the zoom lens on this kind (superzoom/bridge) of camera, because it allows quick AND smooth zooming action using the convenient, powered zoom ring around the shutter release. Most DSLR cameras do not have this feature; you need to twist the zoom lens itself, which cannot be done smoothly throughout its zooming range. This is especially important when shooting video.<br /><br />If you want to know more about this camera, both before and after purchase, you can download two official FZ70 owner's manuals by googling \"fz70 owner's manual\". The Basic manual is 34 pages long, while the Advanced manual is 226 pages.<br /><br />For me, I believe that the best camera is one that I can take with me all the time, without straining my neck, shoulder, or wallet.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Panasonic Lumix FZ70 for convenience and travel photography. While others miss shots contemplating which lens to use and changing lenses, you won't. ;-)","Easy to use.  The pictures are sharp/clear.  The only issue is the bag that was recommended for this camera - to me is a wee bit small.","Thanks for Mr. Gravett and the other's positive reviews. Finally purchased FZ70 and quickly verified how great was the power zoom  beyond the optical range at 132X.<br />Please check out the IQ  at 132X zoom in flickr ---<br />[...]","I'm giving the camera four stars since I'm still learning how to use all the settings but so far I love the camera.","First off, let me say that I am not a pro, or even a hobbyist photographer.  I'm a mom who loves taking pictures of her kids, pets and flowers.  That being said - I love, love, love this camera.  I have never used a Panasonic camera before and I really like the looks and the high quality feel of this.  Using it on full auto, snapping pictures of kids. pets and flowers, and every single picture is beautiful.  Not even an average picture in the lot - everything comes out stunning - beautiful color, sharp images with a perfect focus.  Pictures taken in low light with no flash come out beautiful as well - in fact, I haven't used the flash on it yet.  My previous favorite camera was a Fujifilm FX1, and while I still love it, I think I like this Panasonic slightly better - it seems to be easier to get a nice sharp focus.  Both cameras are excellent in low light without a flash,  but in this scenario I think the Fuji has slighlty less noise and a teensy bit better color saturation.<br />The best thing about this camera, is that you can literally just pick it up and shoot the picture and get gorgeous results, the second best thing about it is the zoom - at 60x you can zoom to your hearts content.  Perfect for kids sporting events.  It is also a little easier to focus at the farthest end of the zoom than I thought it would be.  I also have a SonyDSC-HX20v with a 20x zoom, and I think the panasonic is easier to focus at the highest zoom than the Sony is - however both require a steady hand at full zoom.  What I like about the Fuji and the Sony, though is that they are small enough to fit in a purse - whereas this Panasonic most definitely is not.  However, if you don't mind carrying around the larger camera, then I do think this is a slighty better value - since it combines the gorgeous image capability of the Fuji FX1 with the zoom of the Sony (plus even more zoom).  If you're looking for a high end camera but aren't ready for a DSLR (or if you have a DSLR and sometimes just want a simple point and shoot) then I would definitely recommend this one.","I'll probably only be able to update with more experience with it within a couple of months (1Q'14, when I'll be able to take a lot of real world situation photos, but here is what I tough so far from some tests.<br /><br />I'm currently upgrading from a Canon SX20 IS and was considering Canon SX50 and Fujifilm X-S1 (both around $30-40 more expensive by the time of purchase). Since I tend to take a lot of photos indoor with poor illumination, some reviews I've read set my mind towards FZ70 and its 20mm wide.<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />- 20mm wide: it allows me to cover a lot of width without having to step back much. My previous camera has 28mm and other cameras in this range has 24 or 25mm, tipically.<br /><br />- 1200mm tele: SX50 has the same ammount of tele, but my SX20 maxes at 560mm.<br /><br />- internal memory: not that I intend to run around without a SD card, but internal memory can be a life saver and it allowed for immediate photos after unpacking, since I didn't bought a new SD card (and my current one was very far).<br /><br />- easy to open battery compartment: my SX20 has a battery compartment that is a bit tricky to open. On FZ70, you just slide a switch and it opens. Closing is just as easy.<br /><br />- image quality: my main reason to upgrade. Of course, I fully expected a decent improvement since SX20 is a 2009 camera while FZ70 is 4 years newer. Still, it's quite noticeable when I looked at details while at 100% image size under low light.<br /><br />What I disliked:<br /><br />- Fixed lcd: SX20 has a variable angle lcd viewer (so does SX50), while FZ70 has a fixed one. I almost gave up on buying when I saw it didn't have a variable one, since it's so useful for selfies, seeing what is on it when the camera is too high or to low while mount on tripods and such.<br /><br />- Proprietary USB connector: while most cameras allow USB connection by providing a mini-usb port, Panasonic decided to go with something else and so you're stuck with their cables.<br /><br />- Battery: it was another factor that almost interfered with this choice. It's mostly personal preference, but I'd prefer if it used 4 AA batteries instead of a proprietary li-ion one. I use Sanyo Eneloops in my SX20 and have been happy with their duration (I can shoot 12h of video without needing to replace them). Also, I could buy some alcalines should necessity arises.<br /><br />- No lens hood: it's a pity there are no lens hood in the box. My SX20 came with one. It's a cheap piece of plastic that'd be easy and inexpensive for Panasonic to add in the bundle.","My usual style of camera is the \"semi-pro\" DSLR - I have a Canon 7D. Otherwise I go for small, pocketable cameras such as the Canon PowerShot S90. The Panasonic DMC-FZ70 is a camera style I have not tried before: lightweight, crammed full of features, significant manual controls and extreme zoom capabilities. I took it with me on a trip to a family event to see how it would shake out.<br /><br />I am not going to try to list every feature the DMC-FZ70 has, I'd be here all day. But here are the things that appealed to me:<br /><br />- Full manual controls available, including aperture and shutter priority modes<br />- RAW image capability<br />- Hot shoe for external flash<br />- Separate button to start video recording - no need to \"switch modes\"<br />- 60X optical zoom with optical stabilization<br />- Enough control buttons and dials to satisfy a DSLR lover<br />- Built-in panorama stitching<br /><br />I used the DMC-FZ70 for both video and stills, and was very favorably impressed with the quality of each. I separately bought a PNY 64GB SDXC card which worked just fine. Curiously, the camera has 200MB of built-in storage, so it can take some photos and even short videos without a card. I selected MP4 as the video recording format because I thought that's what I would need for YouTube, though I later learned that the AVCHD mode, which is default, would have worked better. The videos were clear and smooth, and the recorded audio was just fine, with just a hint of wind noise. A wind noise suppression mode is available. There is a \"zoom mic\" mode that will, supposedly, allow you to record sounds from further away when zoomed out - I did not try that.<br /><br />Even though I often choose custom settings on my DSLR, I left the DMC-FZ70 in \"AI\" mode because I didn't want to distract myself from the events I was recording. This worked just fine, and I don't think I would have changed anything. Even in this mode, you can make minor adjustments such as depth-of-field and exposure compensation.<br /><br />I was very impressed with how far out the camera could zoom - even more is available if you want to get into digital zoom (which I avoid). The optical stabilization worked quite well, though at maximum zoom you're really going to want a tripod.<br /><br />I also tried the panorama mode, where you hold down the shutter button and swivel around as it takes many pictures and then stitches them together. This worked fine. I also used the self-timer feature to take a group photo (on a tripod).<br /><br />Is there anything about the DMC-FZ70 I didn't like? Yes. The supplied lens cap doesn't grip very well, but at least it's tethered. Going on the advice of another reviewer, I bought a third-party lens cap (and also a Sigma UV filter, which I put on all my lenses.) In addition to the crisp 3\" display, there is an electronic viewfinder, but you have to switch between them.<br /><br />The Panasonic DMC-FZ70 is lightweight, compact and easy to carry. I can easily see myself taking this places I wouldn't take my DSLR. It would make a great vacation camera as a step up from a typical point-and-shoot, and has enough manual controls to satisfy all but the most die-hard DSLR fan.","Excellent Magna-Zoom PnS camera, It's just as good as my Panasonic LUMIX G10, but w/out all the lenses. I have a similar PnS, being a Kodak Max Z990 w/ 30X Zoom, and this Lumix beats it hands down, well except for one thing,,,Kodak's colour,,It's still unbeatable, even after all these year's.","AMAZING zoom! If for no other reason, this camera gets 5 stars for the zoom! 60x optical zoom is impressive and very sharp, but what is even most impressive is the digital zoom! It is amazingly stable and sharp with little noise in side, and simply fantastic outside. You have many shooting options which is great. I have never been a fan of point and shoots for my serious photography, always relying on one of Canons. Well, I think that for the most part, I may not be using them much anymore (except for macro work). The Lumix DMC-FZ70 is amazingly versatile and can pretty much take care of all of your photography needs. Take a picture of a full moon with full zoom. It is amazing. I had to go into my settings because digital zoom was disabled on my camera. Once you do, you will never turn it off. I really cannot explain my level of awe from this camera. I doubt you will find its equal without spending at least twice as much! It is bulky, but it is a camera, and certainly not as bad as a DSLR plus lenses, etc. The flash works very well and is strong enough that I really cannot complain. The only real problem I had was filling up my 32 gig card too quickly. I started having fun again. Fun that I have not had with photography in a long time. I bought what I needed to be able to take pictures when I had to, but now I have a camera to take pictures because I want to. For me, that is a huge bonus. The camera is stylish and comfortable to use. Burst mode is fast but inside I did get a little blur between images, and it was not because of very fast action, but more when someone was moving their arm/hand. I have several different cards, but I really recommend something fast, like an extreme or extreme pro by san disk. They are so fast, and virtually no waiting. The camera starts up quickly and has almost no lag at all. I think most people would not notice it. I also love that I do not have to use the screen and often use the viewfinder. Video quality and sound is also very good. the camera is fairly intuitive and can be used without reading anything, but I HIGHLY suggest you read up on it and get the most out of this camera. If you are looking for a good general camera with great optics, look no further. You get down to 20mm, btw, which is wide enough to capture a large family reunion photo, and in the next shot you can fill the frame with one persons eye. The finish of the camera has a nice tactile feel to it, and the next strap, while not high end, is comfortable enough. I love that I no longer have to lug around my camera (suit)case. :)<br />I recently recorded my sons bastkeball game and the video was great. I do notice that when I shoot in flourescent lighting, there sometimes is a yellowish hue when I use the flash and the distance is a little long. Still, this is a no brainer folks, I just turn off the flash. Btw, the flash recharges very quickly.","This camera is not user friendly.The manual that comes with it is vague and hard to understand,and poorly written.The camera is difficult to navigate through, and the focus is not sharp or clear. I was very disappointed in this camera and its performance.I would not recommend it to a novice user.","Love this camera. It is light, 16 mp and the zoom is fantastic. There are so many features that I will have to study the manual for a while to know how to use them all. I can hardly wait to take this camera on my next trip. I should get some amazing nature pictures. Zoom is 60x for optical and another 60x for digital (120x). Wide angle is 20 mm and it zooms out to 1200mm at full extension. I looked at various cameras with a mega zoom feature including the Canon SX50. This Lumix has most of the features of the Canon as well as a few extra, a larger optical zoom (60x as opposed to 50x on the Canon) and is priced about $35 less than the Canon. I am very happy with my purchase.","after reading the review,  as was said only 2 things missing on this camera, wi-fi & moveable display.  if U want that spend more money. otherwise this is one nice camera,  shooting at night from  a moving car thru the glass  really outstanding, settings more than enough, adjustable .  would recommend to anyone wanting a point and shoot camera.  20mm to 1200mm.  will cover most of a general nature, and then some.","The Intelligent Auto with this camera at the high and low end of zoom was far more adaptive than my Fujifilm S4000.  My Fujifilm camera (which is a 30x optical super zoom camera) had trouble focusing at times when taking indoor shots and some outdoor shots.  This camera had no focusing problems in Intelligent auto worthy of reporting.<br /><br />I also found the white balance on this camera to be a step above my Fujifilm S4000.  It required me to use my flash more indoors so it could focus and that wasn't so much of an issue with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70.  It took several indoor shots without the need for a flash and it had real time focus creating images that were sharp and clear.<br /><br />On the long end of the optical zoom I did notice some noise in the image, but that's to be expected with a lens this powerful.  It performed very well in high range zoom and in both video and picture taking modes.  It's ability to focus in real time during video mode is pretty good and I tested it during a snow storm just to make it a little harder on the camera.<br /><br />It's been boasted online that you can extend the zoom range on this camera by scaling down megapixel setting.  It does say that in the manual, but I haven't tested that feature.  What I do like about this camera however, is that on the low end of zoom at 20mm, it lets you take a wider shot than other cameras in it's class and some of them even cost more than this camera.<br /><br />Would it be nice if it had a larger sensor?  Perhaps, but I haven't really seen any super zoom camera's that compete with it that have a larger sensor anyway.  That's probably more for an expensive DSLR anyway.  Besides, this camera takes pretty good pictures without the larger sensor.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with it and it's sure better than my old FUJI in every way.<br /><br />I don't know if my opinion counts for anything but I can tell you this is a pretty nice camera.  I'm glad I bought it and I'm thoroughly happy with it and I bet there's a good chance you will be to.  For it's ability, features, and performance, I would say this camera is the best overall value of any camera in it's class being sold today, but that's just one mans opinion.<br /><br />One thing I almost forgot to mention in closing, is that it has a 55mm thread at the end of the lens so you can attach filters for special effects.  That's awesome.  For example, if you wanted to add a Sepia filter you might be able to make your pictures look like they were taken way back in the late 1800's.  It's an awesome special effect.<br /><br />Take care ... and I hope you buy this camera.","I've written before about this camera and I'm not a super camera geek with a lot of expertise. I only know that I've had a couple of \"superzoom\" cameras before, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS19 and a Sony DSC-HX200V and really enjoyed the results with both. I'll have to say that this camera has now taken over as my favorite superzoom. I love the overtly quick zoom capabilities it has, never having to struggle with a locked in zoom that sometimes results in missing a very special shot. A great deal of my shots are wildlife and scenic type shots with many wonderful opportunities here in my Florida home. The quality of my pictures are extremely good, maybe a whisker short of digital SLR type cameras. It took me a bit of time getting acclimated to the idiosyncrasies of the camera after having gotten accustomed to my Sony but since then, wow, am I a happy camper. I just took approximately 550 pictures of a variety of different subjects: owls, sandhill cranes, ducks, blue heron, butterflies and some superior sunset shots and my ability to reframe shots, focus and change angles almost instantaneously allowed me to take numerous shots that I might have missed with another camera having a slower focus capabilities. I have had good luck with my Sony but there were times when I lost a shot because I couldn't concentrate the focus on my subject. This camera allows me to do that easily. Even though I've only had my camera since September I must have already taken 4,000 to 5,000 pictures or more. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys nature and has a moderate budget. I can't imagine anyone other than a professional photographer not being highly satisfied with his or her results.","For a non-professional camera it is excellent.  It is especially good for telephoto shots.  It is also light weight. Recommended.","Took this camera with me on a safari trip to Africa and I was thrilled with my pictures.  I did not want to deal with multiple lenses but wanted a step up from my Cannon with a 20X optical zoom.  Got great shots with the with the telephoto and the shutter speed was fast enough to catch great animal shots.  I love this camera.","Pros:  Light weight bridge camera with super wide angle and ridiculous zoom.  I didn't have time to do a full battery of tests but I did test for ease of use, low light noise, macro, and OIS - I'm impressed with all of these.  The fact that this camera has a 20mm wide angle makes it worthy of adding to my equipment line up, I wanted something light for hiking so I bought the Canon SX280HS.  I'm marginally disappointed with that camera because it's slow and too noisy in low light but at the time of purchase I was pleased with it's zoom (25-500mm).  Four short months this camera was released and as it's the only light weight camera with a 20mm wide angle I just had to try it.  Despite the fact I can't just slip it into my pocket the FZ70 is very light.  I'm 6' tall and the palm grip doesn't strike me as overly diminutive so I can see myself carrying this around with out a strap and not experiencing hand cramps.<br /><br />Despite reading a number of negative reviews, initially, I'm very pleased with the quality.  Low light for a 1/2.3\" sensor'd camera is better then I expected, in fact it's better then the SX280HS (same size sensor) I purchased just a few months prior.  The negative comments surround picture quality, I could not duplicate a scenario that yielded a photo of \"poor\" quality.  While the images are not perfect they are better, IMO, than other point and shoots and perhaps equal to prosumer options from say five or six years ago.<br /><br />Cons:  Finding a bargain - This camera's price seems to be jumping around from the original retail price so be careful.  Thanks to the super zoom and the uninitiated's inability to get a steady shot there are plenty of these as \"used\" which are in fact open box.  Be sure to read the descriptions when sorting through the used vendors as some are missing accessories.  I purchased mine as \"used\" and it arrived with all accessories, repacked in the original box, fulfilled by Amazon Warehouse Deals for nearly 30% off the already on sale price.<br /><br />Summary:  I consider myself an avid enthusiast.  I know how to use a camera in full manual, how to get a steady shot even with out OIS; in fact, I use a full size DSLR (5D mkiii) most times.  I will be using this for my upcoming vacation and leaving the bulky lenses and accessories for my DSLR at home.  I'll still take my jean pocket worthy Canon SX280HS with me but will use this for excursions and killing time on ship.  If you are looking for telephoto capability my recommendation is walk before you run - this camera is good but only if you are familiar with bracing techniques, manual ISO setting, and tripod use.  If you aren't comfortable with say, shooting in full manual mode go with a less expensive shorter range compact zoom.  Check DPReview's site for a great comparison tool.  IMO this camera is as good as it gets for size, zoom range, and low light quality.  Not considering the value of the total package this would be a good camera to have at any price point within it's class of capabilities so if it's not on sale don't mark it off your list.<br /><br />11/22/2013 UPDATE:<br />Add some Pros & Cons:<br />Pros:  I've shot 354 photos, about 150 outdoors, some with fill flash and the remainder inside, most with flash.  I'm very impressed with the battery life, the display indicates I have full battery life remaining even after all that use.  My indoor use consisted of walking around at the convention center here in San Antonio for the Auto Show.  The cameras display stayed on for about 1.5 hours during the time I was taking photos.  Also I wanted to point out the OIS is amazing.  I shot most of my shots today, indoors, in manual mode most at 1/25th of a second some at 1/20th at ISOs between 100 & 400.  Hand held sometimes zooming up to 16 or 18x and the shots came out crystal clear.  I believe out of about 200 shots I may have had two that were not usable due to camera shake.  I don't believe I would have achieved this with my heavier 5Dmkiii with the 24-105mm with IS.  I did have to employ bracing techniques, holding breath, gently pressing shutter and using any railing I could find to lean up against, but no tripod or mono pod.<br />Cons:<br />Pano mode, while it works great, does not have a manual exposure control.  Indoors it forced me to use ISO2000 which leads me to the next con, poor image quality in low light.  I don't know if its a sensor problem or a compression issue as I was using jpg.  It's not terrible but even at ISO400 it's noticeable.  I had spend most of the day yesterday photographing my dogs between ISO 400 & 1600 while indoors and first noticed it but inside the house it's a bit darker then at an auto show.  I knew to try and avoid ISO800 but after today I'd say if you can get the shot somehow with a lower ISO setting, say 200 or the lowest of 100 you'll appreciate the results - so a tripod, mono pod, or bracing techniques are a must.<br /><br />A side note regarding perception of the camera itself.  Last year I used my 5D mkiii at the auto show and I went unnoticed.  This year, with the FZ70, arriving early to the auto show I was approached by some of the presenters who thought I was the official photographer - go figure...<br /><br />As soon as I knew I liked the camera I ordered a spare set of batteries and charger.  Considering how great the battery life is I sort of regret getting two extra batteries.Pack Of 2 DMW-BMB9 Batteries And battery Charger for Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ40K DMC-FZ45K DMC-FZ47K DMC-FZ48K DMC-FZ60 DMC-FZ70 DMC -FZ100 DMC-FZ150 Digital Camera + More!!","It is a great camera and I look forward to its continuing use. The colors are great and the zoom is wonderful.","The camera exceeded my expectations.  I do nature photography.  With that much zoom I can take photos of birds farther away than I could before.  The images are sharp.  The three negative criticisms I have are that it saves RAW images as RW2.  I prefer adjusting the zoom by hand instead of the power driven zoom.  And there is no lens hood.  But I am still very pleased with the camera and give it a top rating.","So far so good.  Really jumps out there for zoom lens with no distortion.  Use in good light, not unlike any lens under $8,000 and big as a cannon.  Intuitive controls without long learning curve.  A bit large for point in shoot, but likely realistic alternative.  Arrive quick, like Amazon is known for.","I've had the FZ70 for 2 months now and this camera is a keeper. I'm a long time FZ user with the most recent ones being the<br />FZ100, FZ150, and the legendary FZ200. So how does the FZ70 compare? I've taken this on multiple family trips, day-to-day shooting, and even in a studio setting. Here are the strengths and weaknesses from my heavy use with the camera:<br /><br />Strengths<br />- Sharp at 20mm at the wide end. The cost of this camera is lower than most dedicated wide angle lenses. If nothing else, you can keep a FZ70 in your bag as an always ready wide angle option.<br /><br />- 5fps with autofocus. Perfect for capturing fast moving action since the camera focuses after every shot.<br /><br />- Super range. 20-1200mm is just insane. 1200mm shots have come out well which wasn't the case with the Sony HX300V. I could not get sharp shots past 800mm on the Sony.<br /><br />- Great video quality at 720p 60p.<br /><br />- Nice and light<br /><br />Weaknesses<br /><br />- EVF and LCD resolution is average to poor.<br /><br />- No 1080p 60p video<br /><br />- 20mm is too wide for the casual super zoom user<br /><br />- It takes technique and practice to get consistent results at 1200mm<br /><br />Conclusion<br />I saved the biggest strength for this wrap up and that is the sensor and the processing engine. Right away the shots I was getting out of the FZ70 showed better dynamic range and stood up to post processing extremely well. The JPEG engine is really great, but the raw files are something special. The amount of detail retained is impressive.<br /><br />That said, this is still a budget bridge camera so keep your expectations in check. I purchased it at a lower price than the initial four hundred asking price and it's available for closer to three hundred now so it's a great bargain.","This camera is very easy to use.  I took the camera on vacation and didn't get a bad picture.  The telephoto lens gave me incredible, clear pictures and using the built in editing feature allowed me to make changes before I downloaded the pictures onto my computer when I got home.  It was also very easy to switch from still pictures to video.  This is my 4th digital camera and it is by far the best I have ever used.  It is the first camera I have used that allows me to get non-blurry pictures of my grandchildren who are constantly moving.","Just took it on a once in a lifetime vacation, just getting it 4 days before I left.  It took fantastic pictures of the polar bears.  The fantastic zoom brought them right up close.  It is easy to use once you get used to the power switch and the mode switch so close together.  Pictures indoors, scenery outdoors;  I even got some pictures of the northern lights by using the self timer as a \"remote switch\".","I'm still discovering its numerous features. But I definitely like what I have seen so far. Yes, a monopod/tripod help at high power zoom values, but that is to be expected. Would've if the screen had swivel/tilt, but this was not a surprise to me. I can live with that.","So much in such a small package!  It will be awhile before I get to use all the features that this camera has to offer.<br />I do like that I do not have to haul around extra lenses.  I have found that if I go tele all the way, I will need a tripod.  I just cannot hold the camera still for that distance.  The menu in the camera allows all kinds of adjustment to pictures taken, if not done in the camera I can wait until processing in the computer.  So much can be done with this camera, it's like having a mini-computer!","The simple deviations from the set features are buried in the various menu selections.  They should be easier to access.  So far, even with a polarizer, the photos were a little overexposed and it took a while until I found the exposure compensation control so that my pictures could be slightly underexposed, giving me more saturation.","Any person not getting what they want from this camera, is expecting WAY too much! I've gotten some of the best pictures of my family from this camera. Great product.","This is a great camera.  I have to admit this is the first really nice camera that I have purchased in several years but it has exceeded my expectations.  The zoom on this camera is impressive.  I was looking for a camera that would take great photos and video, it has exceeded my expectations for both of these requirements.  I was really suprised by the clarity even when using the extended digital zoom.  In the past when I have used the digital zoom on other cameras the picture quality was horrible.  The digital zoom on this camera produces pretty good photos.  I have been playing around with several of the features on this camera but still have a lot to learn.  I think this camera's options will satisfy most users.  If you just want to point and shoot you can always use the automatic settings which produce fantastic pictures.  For the price and quality, this camera is hard to beat.  So far the battery life is great, I have taken several hundred photos (mostly w/o flash) and taken probably an hours worth of video, the battery is still about 1/4-1/2 full.  I would highly recommend this purchase.","While this camera has 16MP like my other micro43 cameras (OM-D EM5, GX7, so forth), they are not in the same class, so don't compare this camera to any mirrorless interchangeable or DSLR. Others have mentioned and tested the camera hardware and image quality ad infinitum, so I only want to point out several items that haven't been mentioned in other reviews:<br /><br />1. The tripod mount is not aligned with the axis of the lens--it is offsetted to the right side of the camera by about 2.5cm (1 in).  This matters quite a bit for panoramas.  Since there is no in-camera panorama or panorama guide, the axial shift means a need to be conscientious about the framing and focal length choices.  Making sure there is sufficient inter-shot overlaps and the perspective distortion of the overlapping areas.  May also need a little bit more post production work during the stitching process.<br /><br />2. At 1200 equivalent, the aperture has a narrow range of f/5.9 to 8, meaning more precise focusing is necessary--cannot rely on depth of field to compensate.<br /><br />3. Image stabilization is not even close to the same level as a DSLR or even the Olympus OM series.<br /><br />4. The EVF-LCD switch is manual because there is no eye sensor.  If you are used to automatic switching, it should not be a big deal to go to manual because the switch is within easy reach of the thumb.  The eyepiece for the EVF is hard plastic so eyeglass wearers would find that uncomfortable and doesn't block stray lights.<br /><br />5. A step down ring 55-52 will not work at the widest angles (~20mm-24mm).  It will cause a ring/vignette.","Fantastic Camera. This is my third Panasonic Camera, each one better than the last.  I carry a Panasonic DMC ZS20 camera in my purse that I use all the time but I also wanted one that had more zoom for when I travel or have my family here or for a hundred and one reasons.  I wanted a camera that would fulfill my desire for great pictures, up close and in the distance, at a reasonable price.  My ZS20 fills my everyday need but this FZ70 does so much more but is too big to carry in my purse.  Of course, there is a lot more to learn about this camera but then it does a lot more than my other cameras.  It is light weight enough to handle with ease and I like the feel of it in my hands.  I do not need a professional camera, just a good camera for my picture taking pleasure.  As far as the bells and whistles, I have not had the chance to go through everything this camera can do as yet but look forward to experimenting in the future.","Bought this camera for my parents who are well into their senior years and were going on a long river cruise through Europe.  It was easy for them to use and powerful and yet light enough for them to grip and manage easily.","If you read all the posted reviews on every camera you may decide none of them are any good, too many complaints, too many issues. Understand the majority of reviews are done by well meaning rookie photographers. Many bought the camera without downloading the operator's manual or checking out professional reviews first. As you read the ones here it is easy to see the rookies, whining about everything. Save your time by checking out what the professionals say. One site, [...] tells you everything you would most likely want to know on this camera. But before you buy any digital camera, check out professional review websites such as Consumer Reports,  [...] [...] & [...]  Also helps to learn more on how to take pictures so you will not blame the camera for your failures. At amazon.com, search for \"Kodak photography books\" or any book you think you may need. See if your local library has them, or download an ecopy. Take the time to research the perfect digital camera for you, learn more on photography, and have a very enjoyable time capturing your memories. Aloha.","I've been looking for a great superzoom camera for several years, tried the Canon SX50 which is very good as well but settled on the Lumix.  It takes great shots, photo printouts are excellent quality for my wife who is an artist.  Took a shot of a full moon, blew it up a little on my software program and the craters on the moon showed up fantastically.  It takes a little getting used to but highly recommend it.  Great camera!","All about the zoom, baby!  The zoom really is incredible in this camera.  I need to experiment with it more, but so far very pleased.","I read lots of reviews, tried out many camera brands, bought this one and boy am I glad. Long battery life, fabulous features. Great GREAT photos and the 60x zoom is unbelievable. Hard to believe this much camera for under $400. I've owned a dozen digitals and this one reminds me of my first love, the Sony Cybershot DSC, the $1000 2002 model. Maybe not as heavy as some would like but it's got s sure handle and no shake so I'm ok with it. Short learning curve, has great viewfinder, the real kind! Buy it, if you're waffling, trust this is one of the best cameras you'll find for twice the money. Get a decent memory card, you'll want the speed ...","First of all I am not a professional photographer graduated from a university, but know a little more than basic concepts. With that said, I believe this camera offers an excellent combination of virtues:<br />-The optical image stabilizer is incredibly good<br />-The interface is a traditional camera (I will love to have one interface like in the lumia 1020 camera app)<br />-The battery life is really good<br />-The zoom of course<br />-The microphone does reduce noise from wind, and a lot.<br /><br />But it also has some limitations<br />-This is not a video camera, yes it records good 1080p but it's not crisp<br />-The LCD panel is fixed, and the LVF pales compared to an optical one(it's not terrible, but an optical is much better)<br />-You will find some noise due to a tendency to elevate the ISO, but nothing the manual settings can't fix<br /><br />All and all, this camera packs a hell of a bunch of features that amateurs and semi-professionals will find very useful and fun to use. I truly recommend this camera, but keep in mind you are not buying a $2000 camera.","I bought this camera for the zoom range, and I am very pleased with that aspect. However, a couple of other things could be improved. For example, the burst rate/buffering is pretty limited. Rapid fire shots (like I am used to doing with my DMC-FZ200) are limited to 2-3 and then there's a substantial wait until the buffer is flushed to the disk. This effectively forces me to be very selective about when I push the release button, especially when I'm shooting action scenes. Another issue is the fixed monitor screen, which isn't much help when the camera is pointed at the sky. Again, I'm spoiled, I suppose, by the FZ200's rotating display. Another surprise came when I tried to take some long exposure night sky shots and found that the camera controls the limits on ISO and shutter speed. This was in P mode, so I need to do some more experimentation before I give up on using it for these sorts of shots.","Just a camera for practicing before I get a more professional one, I have to say it's qualified for that.","Pictutes are so clear and colors are vibrant.  I love it.  going on road trip to capture the beautiful leaves.","The camera is fantastic. I'm not going to repeat what others already wrote, but I wanted to add a few things:<br /><br />1. Panasonic is using a strange folders naming on the SD card where the video clips are hiding. It reminds me Sony. Never understood why it is needed to have the video clips (which are MTS files and not AVI, MOV or whatever you saw before) buried three levels down in the card.<br /><br />2. When the camera is turned ON, there is a strange noise that never stops but increases when the lens is extended. If you place your ear above the Mic, you can hear it well... When you switch the mode to Play, the noise goes away. It is there always and only when the camera is in capturing mode... all modes.<br /><br />3. The Flash shoe, as nice as it may be, does not work with all mountable flashes. I tried the Nikon SB600 and no joy. When I press the shutter button to take a picture, the flash resets and recharges, but there is no flash light... So the shutter causes the short to tell the flash to reset, but not receiving the command to fire it, strange.<br /><br />4. The lack of a lens hood is an issue, especially when you have a lot of light using the zoom. I found a rubber hood with a 55mm thread outside (that fits to the camera thread) and 55mm inside, so you can attach a filter to protect the lens. Of course, found it here on Amazon.<br /><br />I've added a few images of a mountain and cactus using the different zoom settings. You can find those images at the Users Gallery above.<br /><br />Although I have a few minor issues with the camera, I still gave it 5 stars because the number of features that are built into this body and the X60 zoom are just remarkable. I use a DSLR full time and adding this lens in a shape of a camera, as much as there is a difference between the two, is a great way to be more mobile. I am testing more features every day and will update this post with what I find.","The lens was not as good as I expected.  The pictures were soft and the lens was slow to focus.","I took the camera on vacation and loved having it.  The zoom was amazing.  Sure there is a little jiggle at 60x's, but that is to be expected.  I love that you can use filters on it which the FZ40 did not and thus you had to be very protective of the lens.  I'd recommend this to anyone who does not want to carry around a second zoom lens along with their DSLR.","It is beyond my greatest expectations. Since I gave up on my old, very old Maxxum 7000 and went to digital it does all the things the 7000 did and so much more.<br /><br />I especially like being able to change the ISO settings which enables me to take inside pictures without using flash. The manual is huge and I'm still constantly referring to it. It will go to Hawaii in November (the manual) where I expect the make full use of all the abilities of the camera.<br /><br />The $400 price just blows my mind.","I was impressed with the functionality of the camera. Focus was fast, shot to shot recycle time was impressive, battery life was astounding (well over 400 pictures and the battery just dropped by one indicator on the 3-light battery bar). The two speed zoom was nice, easy to control and fairly quiet. I liked that the mode dial appeared on the LCD when you changed settings. Heft and feel were rather nice.<br /><br />And that there's where the plus side ends...<br /><br />I shot over 850 images meticulously testing settings and options in numerous situations and ended up with three pictures I thought were really good.<br /><br />The low light capability even at 20mm wide angle was sub-par. One of my favorite activities is to sit at the beaches here in Florida and watch the sunrise. I've always got a camera with me. Images pre-dawn and at sunrise were... grainy, cluttered, blurry.<br /><br />Post dawn, full light shots of surfers looked like Pointilization art. Even when only zooming out 20x - 30x, far from the extreme limit of the camera, I didn't get one picture I bothered to keep out of well over 150 tries.<br /><br />I also went to a horse show. Full daylight, light fluffy clouds and again shooting well below the full 60x (1,200mm) zoom of the camera and the results were horrid, grainy, full of noise. Many shots looked like badly done art filters in Photoshop rather than photographs from a moderately expensive bridge camera. I also shot a few images at the horse show under the shade of trees and even in iA mode letting the camera pick all the settings and not zooming in at all, images were dark, mottled and grainy.<br /><br />In conclusion... I have an older 30x camera that's getting on in age. I had hoped to retire it and replace it with a new more modern camera. I just wasn't impressed enough with the Panasonic Lumix FZ70. The functionality was great but that's not the most important aspect of a camera, photo quality is and I just wasn't happy enough with the results and returned the camera. For a new $350 camera I expected better. I believe mine may have been one of the rare defective items that occasionally escape quality control.","I love the camera, BUT for a mac user, Panasonic uses a proprietary raw2 format. iPhoto and Aperture will NOT recognize the photos in raw2..\"unreadable files\". NOWHERE does Panasonic mention this. You need to download SilkyPix (for free) BUT WHOAAAA...it is SOOOOOO difficult it put me in tears. There is no export button, I took an hour to look for export or even SAVE ....NOTHING. I figured how to convert to tiff (thinking iPhoto would recognize that) and I think it saved....BUT TO WHERE???? There is no option to save to a folder, or the desktop.<br /><br />Forget the Silkypix manual. If you are proficient w Photoshop this might be okay..but I am not. I want a user friendly camera and user friendly iphoto to process my photos. I want raw to save to the external hard drive... but with this program it is IMPOSSIBLE. You have to telephone JAPAN!!!! For goodness sake Panasonic. The software is a \"DEVELOPER'S TOOL\"!!!! Really????? As a 'bridge' camera, this is for non-professionals....so the software needs to be user friendly.<br /><br />And Panasonic free 800 tech support is just as worthless. He said I needed to contact Apple if iPhoto didn't recognize raw2. As it is ONLY panasonic that uses it, it should be panasonic to supply a user friendly photo processing, NOT this JUNK!! And really, the Silkypix manual is as difficult as the program..NOWHERE does the manual explain how to save to desktop. NOT AT ALL! The directions looses much in translation.<br /><br />If raw is important to you, and yu have a mac, keep this in mind. I am truly thinking of sending this back. The absolute lack of support is troubling!<br /><br />I have added the following to CNET reviews of this camera...I hope you find it helpful.<br /><br />I bought this camera and LOVE it. Sharp, retina colors..just beautiful BUT the raw is misleading. It is raw2, which is proprietary to Panasonic, and for a Mac user , iPhoto  does a \"unreadable files\". So contacted the 800 number and Panasonic rep was useless...told me to contact Apple! REALLY! So tried again w online chat and was told needed to download Silkypix, free and for Mac. WOW...unless your a tech 'geek' this software is sooooooo difficult it left me in tears.  The Silkypix manual, looses a great deal in translation and is like the program..a \"developers tool\"! It is toooo difficult to read and understand. All I wanted to do is take one of the raw2  files, convert to Tiff so I could use in iPhoto or Aperture.  Learned how to convert..BUT no Export button, no save button..no way to export to external  desktop folder and I still can't find the photo I converted. Was so upset deleted program and sent a very angry letter to Silkypix and Panasonic.<br /><br />So if raw is important to you and you use a Mac, you better be VERY knowledgeable in technical terms  or Photoshop because this is way too difficult for an ordinary person to understand. I don't use Photoshop because I find it  difficult to use. I am not a professional photographer, and this is a 'bridge' camera...so Panasonic needs to get rid of Silkypix and use a \"user friendly\" program or get rid of raw2 and use raw.<br /><br />As for the adaptors, they are available on Panasonic's website and Amazon. I did but a uv filter to attach to protect the lens, and other accessories. The video in 1080 is wonderful and I just love this camera, especially for the $358 price I paid on Amazon (plus free shipping and no tax!) BUT I have been taught by my friends at the photo club to always have raw files, and not just jpeg. So I have an external hard drive I keep all my photos on. As I get better at the software I can go back to the raw and process better, but for now it is a steep learning curve for me.  I expected more from Panasonic, this Silkypix program actually and truly  SUCKS! (about the best expression I could use in mixed company that fits the bill!)","I tried the IA and IA+ with this camera and took many pictures in different conditions.  Most of them came out to be unsatisfactory.  The outdoor ones were better than the indoor ones.  I also changed the picture resolutions to try, but I was still not happy with the results.  The video worked better.  Overall, a bit disappointing!","I  had  the FZ47 and have the FZZ00. The FZ47 was a great bargain priced all around camera. The FZ200 has the F/2.8 max aperture lens (from 25mm to 600mm), which makes it a favorite for people who need fast shutter speeds in an affordable package. The FZ70 is, to me, a pumped up FZ47 with double the zoom range. The picture quality is decent and, in good lighting, very good. There is some geometric distortion at full wide angle. If it bothers you, you can correct it in software.  It focuses pretty fast, faster, I think, than the FZ47. Its top burst mode is fast, but shallow - about 3 shots in half a second. In this way, it's much inferior to the FZ200, which fires off shots like a machine gun and goes over 10 shots before pausing briefly to process them. The FZ200 has an articulating LCD scree while the FZ70 doesn't. The EVF is also much sharper in the FZ200.<br />This is not a camera for someone to take to a night time HS football game under the lights. It simply won't get you a fast enough shutter speed to freeze the action as the max aperture at full zoom is F/5.9. However, it could be useful for soccer moms and dads for daylight games. No part of a football field or soccer pitch would be too far for the sideline fan.  It would also be useful for football and baseball fans who sit far from the field and want to get shots of their favorite coaches or players from high up in the stadium during day games. Other people who might like this camera include real estate agents who can get \"the whole house\" easily at the 20mm setting and amateur enthusiasts taking pictures of large groups at work or school.<br />Its intelligent auto mode is actually pretty sharp, picking the appropriate mode (portrait, landscape, night time portrait, low light, etc.).<br />It's not an upgrade from the FZ200. It's an upgrade from the FZ60. However, for less than 400 bucks in the US, I think it's a  good deal.<br />If you are a photographic perfectionist, a so-called \"pixel peeper\", don't get this camera. Spend the money and get a DSLR with a good lens or two. It will probably cost you well over $1,000. It will not give you the reach you have with this camera.<br />This camera is like a decent decathlete - it can do lots of things pretty well, but it won't match the \"specialists\" in their strengths.<br />I like this camera and recommend it. However, if you are happy with \"just\" 25-600mm and can spend $150 to $200 more, consider the FZ200. It's the gold medalist for \"decathlete\" cameras.","I am trading in my FZ150 and replacing it with this unit.  The zoom is wonderful and for the landscape pictures I take, it is great.  You really don't need a telescopic lens when you have this unit.  The picture quality is excellent and the camera well balanced.  Good job, Panasonic.","This is a great camera for users who want to use long focal length for wildlife and don't want to spend money for a huge, heavy and expensive DSLR lens.<br /><br />Build Quality:<br />Overall, the product quality is very good for this price range. I don't own a lot of compact cameras. I have experienced with several DSLRs from Canon, Nikon and Pentax. This camera has similar or even better quality than the entry level DSLR, but definitely less solid than mid-range or full frame ones (Nikon D90, Canon 7D, 5D Mark...). The body is all plastic expect for the hot shoe. The hot shoe design is not perfect. My Yongnuo-560II cannot fit in because of the big built-in flash housing next to the hot shoe. The pop-up flash can trigger the off-camera flash without problem. I think this is a good thing for people who is learning photography.<br /><br />Lens quality:<br />I am satisfied with the image quality. DO NOT expect some DSLR or mirrorless cameras' image quality. This camera can do a lot of things that others cannot with such a low cost. The image is perfectly fine for travel and family. The zoom and focus are relatively quick and quiet. I will upload some images when I shoot more with it.<br /><br />Low light performance:<br />ISO 800 and 1600 are usable. For 4X7 or 5X7 print, you can even consider ISO 3200, which is the highest for this camera. It is not very interesting to zoom 100% or check pixels for this camera (or any other camera). Again, this is perfect for travel or family use.<br /><br />Others:<br />1200mm is possible with hand-held, but you need good light and at least 1/200 shutter speed.<br />The manual could be better. It is too simple for such a camera. It took me some time to learn how to use it, because a lot of buttons have many functions.","After extensive testing with some of the different settings I can tell you the camera exceeds in many areas. If you aren't overly concerned with printing pictures of larger size this camera will fit your needs.. The sharpness even at full zoom is great and the noise level isn't bad at all.<br /><br />[...] 1 great example of the video quality and zoom quality of wildlife.<br /><br />another amazing example of the low light quality in videos [...]<br /><br />and lastly for image quality once you learn the camera you can expect results like this [...]<br /><br />Thanks for reading.. this is my first review ever on Amazon.Com but I felt the need to express how amazing this camera is..","I love the camera, but it is much different that my other Lumix FZ cameras, and I really really needed an owners manual to take to Yellowstone with me the day after I got it.  I was not expecting too much considering the extreme zoom and the price, but it takes very good shots even on iA.  Being sure the image stabilizer is on if very difficult to ascertain.  If it costs too much to include the complete manual, make it an option at an increased price, or include one in English and make other languages available on the net.  In fact I am still trying to figure out how to change the f.stop on it for more depth of field.<br /> One of the best buys around all things considered, especially for those who shoot wildlife.","I've only had mine a few days so my testing is admittedly limited. Please do not give up on this camera unless you have made some very careful tripod shots. Yes, this camera is hard to hold steady as is any 300+ mm lens. The stabilizer is good but cannot overcome everything. Hand holding 1200mm is a tough job and requires excellent technique and a degree of luck!<br /><br />I used a heavy Bogen tripod on solid cement and made very careful shots at about 50yds and 75yds (auto focus) throughout the available f range at max zoom. I was quite surprised at the resolving power of the lens using ISO 100.<br /><br />My Nikon D5000 and Nikkor 70 - 300 EDIF zoom in RAW mode, on the same subject, is barely sharper.<br /><br />Laugh if you will, but I used the SilkyPix software to examine the RAW and jpeg images. I did not find a difference even worth mentioning in raw and jpeg modes. I did not use the default picture settings in the camera. SilkyPix works just fine if you take a bit of time to learn to use it. I also own PhotoShop and have used it for over 20 years, so it's not like I didn't have a choice.<br /><br />All images benefited from a bit of post processing just as all my D5000 and P7700 images do.<br /><br />I can see how some users might easily rush to judgement on this camera. But it shouldn't be about lens sharpness. Hold it steady and it will deliver very good results. Many of the review sites have not done a real good job of testing the camera yet. Buy it and make your own carefully controlled tests, then decide.<br /><br />Hand held tests at very high magnifications are totally INVALID for lens critiquing purposes. Few people can hold that long lens steady enough. High ISOs will certainly help keep shutter speeds high, but it's the high ISO NOISE then that will ruin the image sharpness .. not the lens.<br /><br />Use a SOLID tripod to test the long zoom for yourself. Do it at ISO 100 first.<br /><br />At my work, photographing motorcycles indoors, hand held, under less than optimal lighting, I have used the camera at ISO 1200. Plenty of noise but these images are used at 1024 x 768 (72 dpi) on the internet. The noise at that size and resolution is invisible and the available light shots are quite usable..<br /><br />The weakness I see and have not found a solution for is highlight clipping. In my tests, light subjects were hard to hold detail in. Perhaps further experimentation with the picture controls may help. Noise seems to creep in early too.<br /><br />We can't have it all. Twenty to 1200mm is an amazing accomplishment for Panasonic. Remember this is a consumer level camera. At this price point it seems to represent a very good value and a very versatile photographic tool. Perfect? No. None of them are.<br /><br />My previous Panasonic was an FZ35 which, once I learned to use it properly, was an truly excellent camera. This one probably has a steep learning curve too.<br /><br />Giving a star rating was hard. With so little testing I hated to rate it yet. Too low ... too high??<br /><br />My advice is forget the \"stars\" and test the camera on YOUR own favorite subjects, then decide if it's any good. But, be fair to the camera and be sure any problems you encounter aren't YOUR personal technique problems.<br /><br />September 30,2013<br /><br />In the end I just could not love this camera. I wanted to, but I couldn't. I bought it mostly for the long end of the zoom but what I think is a decent lens is hampered by some other factors. Maybe the sensor, maybe the camera software, I don't know. I shot a lot of long zoom photos in bright light and high shutter speeds and for me it just wasn't quite there. High ISOs significantly mar the images after 250. If you do a lot of tripod work maybe this will work out for you. If the lens were \"faster\" ( like the FZ200), it might be much better, but it is what it is. The combination of sensor noise and slow lens at zoom combine to make less than optimal images when hand holding.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I did get some very nice images from the camera but I had to shoot a lot of frames and be very selective of the images. I'm not saying this is a BAD camera. It just didn't totally please me.<br /><br />I did like the 20mm aspect of the lens and used in shorter focal lengths I thought it did very well. I'm sure many will find this camera very useful and perfectly satisfactory. I personally will wait a wee bit more for the next round of improvements and try again.<br /><br />Compared with the really excellent images from my P7700, I just couldn't justify keeping it. DARN! Bottom line is I'd rather have a somewhat shorter zoom with a faster lens and a less noisy sensor that makes better images. I'm gonna miss that 20mm though .....","I'm new to this camera and new to super zoom cameras, but like<br />what I've seen so far.  I'll post a picture of a football game<br />in normal view then in 60x view when I figure out how to add<br />customer photos.","Image quality is very good IMO. I still have lots more testing to do in this area however.  The 20mm wide shots are amazing. My FZ150 has a 25mm wide and this camera appears to take in approx. 20% more coverage. I was able to shoot at max zoom and get good results hand holding the camera. This was in bright sunlight so with less light I wouldn't expect such good results. I really dislike the on/off switch. Hard to move and feels like it will break easily. On the physical positive side the shape of the grip is excellent. The palm of your hand makes full contact with the camera. Much better than my FZ150. I also like the slightly raised Video button and its location. I can find it by feel now. The wheel on the back of the FZ70 is a huge improvement over the one on the FZ150. It sticks out more now and is easy to turn. I've only had the camera in my hands since yesterday and will add more impressions as I get deeper into it but except for the lousy on/off switch I'm quite impressed at this point.<br /><br />Here's my update.<br /><br />After quite extensive testing comparing the zooms on my FZ150 with the FZ70 I decided to return the FZ70. I can crop the shots taken with the FZ150 to equal the reach of the FZ70 and I actually like the results from the FZ150 better. I tired various settings on both cameras so I'd be comparing apples with apples as close as possible. The big attraction for me with the FZ70 was the extra zoom but if I can get the same IQ cropping my FZ150 shots that cancels out the main advantage of the FZ70 for me.  Also I found I really missed the articulated LCD that the FZ150 has.  I will miss the 20mm wide angle and the great grip on the FZ70. I won't miss that terrible ON/OFF switch on the FZ70.  I feared every time I moved that switch it was going to break. I loved the wheel and Video button on the FZ70 however. Hey, I won't have to buy an LA8 adaptor tube to attach my Olympus TCON 1.7X lens to this FZ70 now.  Cheers everybody, I'll still be following your comments.  Maybe Pany will come out with an FZ250-300 in the future. I'll just have to wait and see.","So far, I am very happy with my new Panasonic Lumix.  I am mostly a point and shoot photographer.  The clarity is beautiful, crisp and clear. I take mostly landscape, sunrise and sunset shots.  I also pre-ordered this Lumix -and got a credit for the price difference.  The zoom is great! Last evening, I had the opportunity to take some long range pictures down the beach - and they came out very clear for the distance I was shooting.  Love the panoramic setting on the top dial of the camera for taking multiple shots of the beach side... A few pix came out with funny lines but most came out beautifully...<br />Amazon Customer service staff were so helpful with all my questions.  I ordered the free shipping (5-8 days).  I received my camera in 3 days! Just in time for my trip!<br /><br />Back with an update.  Again, I've only been taking photos for a couple of years, so I'm still fairly new at all this. Took the Lumix to the beach last weekend... The camera performed well in the blue sky weather that prevailed. The panoramic setting is great for beach shots although I found some images had lines with some different light exposures.<br /><br />The biggest problem I'm having is red diagonal lens flares when I shoot sunset shots.  My Lumix (DMC-ZS10 w/ 16x zoom) or my husband's Canon Power Shot cameras never showed that much flare...As most of my pix are sunrises and sunsets, this is a big problems....any suggestions would be appreciated.","Got this camera several days ago.  Panasonic used to lead the herd, now they seem to be following it.  I've owned 4 super zoom cameras prior to this one so one would think each camera should be an improvement over the previous year's leader.<br />  My first two purchases were Lumix models about 8 and 10 years ago...poor performance at the far ranges of their digital zooms due to stability systems that did not get the job done, subpar picture quality and panorama pictures which consisted of a rectangular aperture in the lens.<br />  My next super zoom purchase was the Olympus SP 800UZ, which also had major stability issues at the far ranges of the zoom, rendering it almost unusable except for the mid-range shots and panorama shots which when stitched together looked uneven and worthless.<br />  I bought the Nikon Coolpix P510 2 years ago and was  pleasantly surprised by it's performance.  Great panorama shots, no stability problems at the far ranges, and excellent quality shots.  The computer software that came with it was top notch.  Even came with GPS for geo-tagging photos.  Only problems were jerky poor quality videos that had to be \"enhanced\" using YouTube and autofocus problems with even midrange zoom photos and poor battery life.<br />  The owners manual supplements the quick start booklet, but you'll need a separate carrying case to carry it around.  It's 226 pages long and took two hours to download and print from the CD, but if you want to utilize the camera to its full potential, you will need to bring it with you on photo shoots.<br /> There is no user guide on the camera, and the quick start booklet shows you the basics like how to charge the battery and attach the shoulder strap to the camera.  If you encounter an error message while taking shots you will have to refer to the owners manual for an explanation.<br />  There were several other issues:  if you want to resize or crop the photo you've just taken, you must leave the date/time stamp function off.  Stamped photos cannot be edited in-camera, but they can be edited/enhanced using any basic online photo sharing sotware once downloaded on your computer. You could leave the time/date stamp function off, edit your photos and use the text stamp function to date/time stamp your photos. Unfortunately, this method will make a date stamped duplicate photo of every photo taken.  Take 100 photos and use this method and you end up with 200 total with 100 duplicates that have to manually deleted on your memory card.<br />  Even my cheap Samsung wiil allow me to trim or enhance stamped photos in-camera.  Why would Panasonic force you to make a choice?<br />  The good points for the FZ-70:  no stability problems encountered at the far ranges of the zoom.  Pictures taken using the various modes were far superior to the Nikon; much shorter time for the camera to autofocus on it's subject using the zoom (unless you attach a converter lens).  The in-camera editing features were much better than the Nikon and the quick retouch feature is easy to use.<br />  I've had a chance to use the video function and the videos are HD and camcorder quality, far superior to the Nike's video recording abilities.  There is one feature not available on the Nike.  You can take still pictures while recording videos, however doing so will prevent you from using the telephoto function while shooting videos.  Just one more example of two steps forward whilw taking one step backward should you decide to purchase this camera.<br />  The camera has a hot shoe to attach an optional flash, and if 1200 mm is insufficient zoom for you, an adapter and a 1.5x converter lens can get you even closer to your subject, but the owners manual states you may encounter focusing issues by doing so.<br />  I had wanted to give this camera a 5 star review but 4 stars will have to suffice.","Can anyone give your opinion in the difference of cameras and photo quality of both the SX50 and FZ70,, at the 20mm and 1200mm. Would you give up your Canon SX50 for the FZ70?","This is not my primary digital camera.  I also own a Nikon D300.  You cannot compare a high-end semi-pro camera with a point and shoot camera with a fixed zoom lens.  This Panasonic camera takes excellent pictures.  It is light-weight (Compared to my D300) and has a wealth of built-in controls to handle a variety of picture taking situations.  It takes a 55mm filter size.  The eyepiece view finder is just ok but I prefer to shoot with this rather than the 3\" LCD viewer.  Note that the 3\" LCD view screen is not bad at all.  Be careful about ordering some of the items listed with the camera.  One of the compact camera cases is too small.  Also some of the batteries listed are not for the FZ-70.  However this review is about the camera and it is a good camera for a beginner or a travel camera.","Initial impression: It's hard to believe what this camera's capabilities are until you've used one.  I have bags full of camera equipment including a Mamiya RB-67, Pentax 6x7, Canon 5D Mk2, Canon T2i and a lot of glass so trust me when I say, this camera lives up to the pre-release hype.  I originally had my sights set on the Canon SX50 which is a good camera, but falls short of its Lumix peer.  My focus was to get an easy to use point-and-shoot camera for my wife since the SLRs were just too much for her to handle - but now she's going to have to fight me for it.  I will update this review as I gain more experience with the video and special functions (which there are many) in the future.  Until then, I recommend you get one while the price remains well below $400 because I don't think it will stay their long when the word gets out how great this camera performs.<br /><br />UPDATE: After using this camera for nearly 6-months, I am still VERY happy with it and the pictures it produces - and would be glad to share some of the shots.  I find the extremes between other reviewers ratings interesting since I have not experienced many of the negatives mentioned and have experienced most of the positive remarks.  This camera simply works for me.  I've shot everything from sports car road races to retirements to scenery with great success and carrying this 1 lb 7.2 oz camera sure beats the heck out of hauling my 12 lbs of 5D Mk 2, with dual battery pack and 50-500mm Sigma lens around all day plus a couple extra lenses and batteries in a camera bag.  I also have no trouble taking my shots to 13x19 inch prints from either RAW or JPEG format files.  I've also read this camera is big and bulky.  Well, if you wear XXL gloves like I do, it fits just right in my hands.  It also works much better in my wife's hands than the DSLRs we have (T2i in addition to the 5D)so she is happy too! The weight is simply not a concern to us as we've both carried it around all day without any problems or side effects.  In fact, now that the price has dropped to $249 I'm going to buy another one to keep peace in the family.<br /><br />Several reviewers mentioned soft pictures at the 1000 to 1200mm end of the zoom range.  I'd bet your paycheck that most of the problem is camera movement since it is very difficult to hand hold any camera still enough at this extreme magnification to get a super sharp picture - regardless of image stabilization system employed.  I've had much better luck using a monopod or even better, a solid tripod (as one reviewer suggested) to get those very sharp long range shots.<br /><br />I also discovered the automatic backlit scene sensing and exposure system when I moved to the fully automatic setting - very effective!<br /><br />But as I said, the proof is in the final product so if you would like to see a sample of images - reply to this review and include your email address and I'll share a few with you.","Just received my new Panasonic DMC-FZ70 from Amazon.  First thing is that I had preordered it and the price changed by the time I had delivery.  Called Amazon and explained the problem and the very polite lady credited my account with the difference.  It turns out that if you preorder you must call them if the price changes.  They do not automatically credit your account.  Hope this little bit of information will save money for anyone else who preordered.<br /><br />Now as to the camera itself.  So far I am absolutely thrilled and hopeful.  It replaces an old FZ-7 which still works but the new features and the wide angle on the FZ70 made me want it.<br /><br />One odd thing is that when the camera is turned on there is a very soft continuous sound coming from the camera when you are doing nothing with it.  So I called the Panasonic support folks and they were essentially worthless and suggested sending the camera back.  I called a local camera store and by luck they had one sitting right there.  The very polite lady listened to my question and said well it shouldn't be making any noise.  Then she turned their FZ70 on and she held it up to her ear and said \"oh my golly there is a continuous noise\".  Bingo!  With two cameras doing it perhaps then this is normal.  The sound as near as I can describe it is very soft and makes me think of an old coffee percolator that would be in the other room.<br /><br />So far every feature on the camera seems to work just fine.  I was surprised to see that it was built in China because my FZ-7 was built in Osaka Japan and somehow I had been led to believe that this series was built in Japan.  That is not a deal killer for me.<br /><br />The weight and feel of this is impressive compared to my older FZ-7.  Fits a man's hand better.<br /><br />The software that comes with it is impressive.  I bought a Hoya Alfa MC UV and lens protector from Amazon in the 55mm size and it should protect the lens and not degrade the photos.  Bought the Transcend 32GB SDHC. Bought the AGFA Photo Heavy Duty Rubber lens hood in 55mm and that is a bit problematic.  I believe I will keep it for outdoor shots but for flash it is in the way of the distance finder which apparently determines the amount of flash.  Also in full wide angle there is a very slight interference but a slight zoom out from full wide angle and that fixes that. At any rate I will keep the lens hood and just screw it in as needed and not tighten it so it can be removed quickly. To many times in sunlight I find a lens hood to be a necessity.<br /><br /> Can't wait to get some pictures and video to see the quality and update this review.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Still very happy and the quality of the photos is exactly what I hoped for.  The low light capability is excellent and beyond what I was expecting.  Using it mostly in the AI and Scenery modes.  Very impressive.  More capability here than I would expect for this price.  I had actually considered the Nikon D7100 but thought the weight wasn't something I wanted to be hiking with.  More going on inside this little jewel than I have time to understand but wow.  Example is in the AI mode I was using the zoom to take a close up and the symbol on the screen changed to the little flower which on my old FZ7 would have been a setting for taking close-ups of things like flowers.  I will be using it today at a soccer meet with my Granddaughter playing and can't wait to see how it performs.  For this price point you can't beat this camera.<br /><br />Shot a small video also and used the zoom quite a bit to see how the stabilization worked.  Well the video was better than my dedicated Panasonic HD camcorder.  So I will just be carrying one camera now.<br /><br />One small thing that I do wonder about is the lens.  Is it a Leica?  Doesn't say Leica on the lens like my old FZ7 and frankly for the quality of the pictures I'm getting it doesn't matter but that little L on the camera body ....always thought that was for Leica but maybe it is for Lumix.","Added 9/24/13 this is by far an amazing camera~~ You need to read the manual which is in PDF form to grasp everything you can do with this. I am able to take the best action shots ever of my sons sports and with a little reading and playing around can not shoot night action shots which I could never do before. There are tons of information in the manual to help you take the best photos ever!! I have also ordered and started using the DMW-LT55 lens with the adapter, you need an adaptor to use the long range lens and I cant even express how great my photos are!! This is the camera for someone on a budget but they want bells and whistles..<br /><br />added 9/9/13  Camera worked above what I expected at my sons football game when it was still light out. Being as I know you need to use manual setting under the lights and I have yet to learn that the still shots at night were just as great, motion not so much but that's user error not the camera!! The action shots when the sun was still up turned out great and I was at the tip top of the bleachers still getting closer shots then my old 24zoom!! Cant wait to use it again and to learn the best manual setting for the night/stadium light shots seeing as its about to be fall and the games will soon start in the dark!!<br /><br />I am a single parent to a child in sports.. DSLR's are just not in my budget with the lenses costing so much so I got this. Ive been using an Olympus for the past 3yrs and love it. This camera so far as exceeded everything on my old camera EXCEPT for the photo burst shots.. my old camera can take 40 photos in seconds this one seems to have a lag when continuous shooting. We shall see come Friday night when I use it at my sons football game.  So far the indoor shots I took along with some outdoor ones are crisp, clear, and the 60 zoom is about as far as you can go without losing photo quality. I was surprised at the clarity of the long range shots but the true test will come when shooting action sports.  I will update the review after a few weeks and my comfort level grows with the camera but for now I am in love!!","I upgraded from FZ60/2 to this model as I wanted ability to shoot in RAW format, hotshoe for flash and for the extra zoom.<br /><br />All round I am extremely pleased with camera: handles well and feels solid and chunky but not too heavy.  The zoom is outstanding - optical to x60 excellent and the digital iZoom doubles this with no loss in image size and manageable loss in quality, there is more digital zoom on top of this but then noise really starts to become unacceptable. In amongst all the zooming options I shouldn't forget to mention the wide angle ability (20mm) which is significantly better on this model and excellent both for landscapes and indoors<br /><br />Also pleased with clarity and simplicity but also the depth, of the menu settings and ease of access - normal via menu button, quick menu button and via scroll dial plus two customisable shortcuts.  This has made using the manual settings straightforward. One other plus point is the start up speed - I would estimate at approx 1 second.<br /><br />Picture quality has been very pleasing from macro to zoom - even on large PC monitor display<br /><br />Downsides - no real negatives - I'd have liked the LCD not to be fixed but really just a quibble rather then a complaint<br /><br /> Extremely pleased I upgraded and delighted with the camera's performance. Hope this helps","I bought this as a carry around. I shoot with D3s and D600 Nikons.  Everything seems great so far. I had an older FZ model years ago that I loved and am excited about this one.  I have not yet figured out how to set aperture in manual mode so if anyone knows please comment.  I do think it's lame that Amazon dropped the price as soon as the pre-ordered cameras were shipped.","Update: 11/17/2014.  I have used the camera for several months now and love it.  I really like the zoom range of the camera from 20mm to 1200mm and it is my main daily carry camera.  It takes great detailed photos and the noise levels are very good.<br /><br />The is going to be a quick review on the camera and I will add more as time goes on.  The FZ70 takes really good sharp photos, but hand held might be a problem in lower light levels.  I went out yesterday evening and took some shots hand held and they all came out blurry.  I should have paid more attention to the shutter speed.<br /><br />The camera works fantastically in iA, which is the auto mode. I mainly use Aperture but was impressed with the auto settings.<br /><br />It will go with a 60 second exposure in the Starry Sky Mode, which is under the SCN mode on the main dial.<br /><br />The lens thread is 55mm so if you plan on using your filters from any other Pany camera, you will need a 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter.  Amazon has them for cheap.  I don't think vignetting will be a problem using 52mm filters as the lens is way smaller than the filter threads on the camera.  Here is the 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter.<br /><br />Goja 55-52mm Step-Down Adapter Ring (55mm Lens to 52mm Accessory) + Bonus Ultra Fine Microfiber Lens Cleaning Cloth<br /><br />The camera has no shutter remote cord jack, so a shutter release cable will not work.  My Yongnuo YN-560 flash will not work on the camera either.  It physically hits the camera flash housing, which is raised a little.  The answer to that is to use a wireless flash trigger with the Yongnuo Flash and that works fine.<br /><br />Addition:  I looked at the Yongnuo flash again and it will fit on the camera, but it is a tight fit between the camera flash and the Yongnuo flash housing.  I modified the Yongnuo flash by taking some of the plastic off the flash housing where the camera flash is hitting, with a pencil grinder.  It doesn't take much, and it is right in the middle of the housing.  You could remove some of the plastic in the flash housing with sandpaper, but it would take longer, but will also give you more control of how much plastic you are taking off.  Now my Yongnuo Flash works perfectly on the FZ70 camera!<br /><br />The video does not have a progressive setting.  Interpolated is the best you are going to get with this camera.<br /><br />The FZ70 does not have a jack for a shutter release cable and does not have an infrared input either.  The camera has to be set to a timer delay within the camera for 2 or 10 seconds.  If it was a Sony or Canon, the timer is set and stays on till you shut it off.  Unfortunately this camera requires you set the timer delay for each and every photo.<br /><br />The longest the camera will go on exposure under the Shutter or Manual Mode is 8 seconds.  In the Starry Sky Mode it will go 15, 30, and 60 seconds.<br /><br />Like I said the lens thread is 55mm so your filters will have to be that size or use an adapter.  The camera will use a teleconverter with the DMW-LA8 adapter, which is not available yet.  Addition:  Those LA8 adapters are available on Ebay now.  They are being sold out of Japan though.  I had that happen with the FZ200 camera as well and had no problem getting one from a Japanese Ebay member.  There are several teleconverters that work well with this camera, but may not be needed as this lens rocks as far as zoom goes!<br /><br />Update:  An aftermarket adapter is now available for a good price.<br /><br />Lens Adapter For Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 (55mm) (Alternative For DMW-LA8)<br /><br />It will take Raw pictures, but no one is supporting the FZ70 Raw files yet.  It will come.  Added: I found that FastStone will support the Raw files from the FZ70 and it is much better than Silkypix, in my opinion.  Just Google FastStone and download and install the software.  It is free.<br /><br />Upadate: Raw for the camera is now supported in Lightroom and Photoshop.<br /><br />Start up time is very fast.  I was able to take a picture in one second after turning the camera on.<br /><br />The focus button is on the top of the camera now.  The AF/MF/Macro button is on the right side of the LCD instead of on the camera lens.<br /><br />One thing I have noticed with this camera is the noise, or should I say the lack of noise!  The shots I took at ISO 800 and ISO 1600 still look pretty good, and at ISO 100 noise is hard to find.<br /><br />The camera will zoom to 60X (1200mm 35mm Equivalent) in the 16mp picture size.  Setting the picture size to 10mp will give you 75X zoom, setting the size to 7mp will give you 90X, at 5mp you get 108X and at 3mp is 135X.  This is Extended Optical Zoom.  If you need more zoom than that, under IResolution, use I-Zoom for an additional 2X at all picture sizes and digital will give another 2X, but image quality will suffer. I took some shots at the 10mp picture size with I-Zoom on, and the photos in my photo software are showing 3030mm zoom and they look amazingly good! I will post a link to some shots in the first comment on the review.<br /><br />There are two FN buttons on the camera that can be set the way you want them to be.  I set FN 1 button to Bracketing and FN 2 button to Flash Control.  I may change them as time goes on, but I find it really great to be able to get Bracketing with the push of a button.<br /><br />I don't care much for the lens cap, and ordered a better 55mm one on Amazon.<br /><br />eForCity 55mm Camera Lens Cap, Black<br /><br />I use filters as it seems more often than not, I end up with my fingerprints on the lens filter.  It also keeps dirt and grime from getting to the lens.  It might offer some protection in an accident too. I would stay away from Hoya UV filters on this camera.  I was using one for a while and noticed the photos look fuzzy at full zoom.  I discovered it was the Hoya HMC filter I was using.  I now use a Sigma UV filter on the camera and it works great with no distortion at high zoom.<br /><br />Sigma EX DG 55mm Multi-Coated UV Filter<br /><br />The camera does not come with a lens hood and none is available in the Accessories on the Panasonic web site either.  It seems there is no lens hood for this camera at this time.<br /><br />This is it for now.  I will add to this review as time goes by, so check back often.<br /><br />Addition:<br /><br />I had a chance to check out the high speed picture mode with the camera and found this:  At 2 fps (frames per second) all works as advertised and it takes 2 fps for an extended period of time. 5 fps - it takes 5 frames per second for 3 shots and goes back to the 2 fps rate.  I tried it in Auto Focus mode and the regular mode with the same results.  9 fps - Once again, 3 shots and then the 2 fps rate.  H Mode - the camera took a very fast rate of speed (at least 9 frames per second) for 9 shots, or 1 second.  I have since found in the manual that at that speed the picture size is 2.5 or 3 mp.  I forgot which.  That is excellent.  The last mode is the Flash and it will take 5 quick photos with flash before stopping.  That could come in very handy at times.<br /><br />I really like this camera.  I like the menu system on the Panasonic Cameras too.  I have the Canon SX50 as well, and still have problems with the menu settings and I have had that camera for 6 months.  The menu system just doesn't make sense to me on that camera.<br /><br />I did a shootout with the Canon SX50, the Pany FZ200, the FZ70, and a Sony Nex 6.  The FZ70 images look about the same as the Canon SX50, and in my mind better than the Pany FZ200 camera.  The last shot is a Raw shot from the FZ70 camera converted to JPG.  The picture files can be seen in the Comments on page 12, the 7th post.<br /><br />Added:  After using this camera for a while now,  I am even more impressed with it.  It takes great pictures and I really like the Panasonic Menu, which is laid out well and easy to use.  I am getting lots of keeper photos and the lack of noise in the shots is really appreciated!<br /><br />Addition 10-29-13  I sent the first FZ70 back because the photos at high zoom were soft.  To make a long story short, it turned out that the Hoya UV filter I was using on the camera was responsible for the soft photos.  I have changed to a Sigma DG 55mm filter and the results are outstanding.  Sharp clear photos at all zoom levels.  This camera takes photos every bit as sharp and detailed as the Panasonic FZ150 or FZ200 camera and is as good as the Canon SX50 in sharpness as well."]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5","amazon_reviews":["The best video quality you can get, but low lights are ok, a lot of noise. the sony a6500 is better in low lights and at half the price. i spent 3200$ + lens on this. not worth it though. go get a sony a6500 or even an a6300.","Not what I expected.","Hello, a few days ago I received my new Panasonic GH5 and my first impression is that it is a very complete camera, with many features.

Thanks Panasonic!","I purchased the GH5 for its obvious video capabilities and it hasn't let me down. What's surprising is it's photo capabilities. The 6K photos that are pulled from the video capture are crisp like a normal picture. The in camera stabilization is awesome. You can literally use a zoom lens to shoot handheld video of the moon and get incredible results which my Canon cameras never got. There is one issue that I hope will get an update soon:<br />The 10 bit recording crashes when editing in Adobe Premiere and FCPX.

Low light and auto focus performance is lacking, but otherwise it is fantastic! Much recommended for the price range!","I've been using a Blackmagic Production Camera for the last few years, along with a LUMIX G7.  I was really looking forward to the GH5 and preordered it as soon as it went up on Amazon.  I'm glad that I can move my MFT lenses over to this.  I'll take some more videos tomorrow in low light with a very fast lens. to see how it measures up.","I will update this review as time goes on. At this point I have only experimented with the camera for several hours, but I already have enough information to form a solid foundation for a review (I have also used the GH4 for a few years).<br /><br />  I run a small video production company, and for years I have used the GH4 for capturing high quality video. The problem is that every video shoot also requires several high quality/professional photographs. While the GH4 excelled in capturing video as a true camera it always came up short. As a result, I was always forced to lug my Nikon D750 around with me. I would travel with two cameras, and two sets of lenses. Occasionally,  I would substitute the Nikon for my Fujix100T or I would substitute the GH4 for my Osmo Pro (recently it has been more of the later).<br /><br />  What I need... want... would love .... is camera to do all of it.  I guess I could invest in the FF Sony, but the idea of investing in a 3rd set of lenses doesn't exactly excite me.  At some point.... either the video on the Olympus will come up... or the photo stills on the Panasonic will improve...right?  Based on my tests - I think the GH5 will become my Holy Grail of cameras. I have 0% doubt that it will perform for video (and my the couple of tests I have run look very favorable), but my worry was IQ.  The new 20.3MP resolution has me hopeful that the GH5 will become my one camera for all purposes.<br /><br />  Photos - Again - I will update this as time goes on<br /><br />  - The upgraded sensor seems to make a large difference.In the photos I attached the 1st picture was taken at ISO 400 while the rest were at ISO 1600. Frankly, I always got nervous taking my GH4 above ISO 800 the noise and grain really started to become noticeable. The GH5 looks very usable at ISO 1600 ( I need to check ISO 3200 a little closer).  For full disclosure the ISO 1600 shots were taken with the Panasonic Leica f1.2 42.5mm gem of a lens.<br /><br />  This is a good point for a tangent,. The reason why i like the MFT format (in addition to the cameras being physically smaller) there are some very excellent lenses out there.  I would stack the Olymous Zuiko lenses up against the branded Nikon lenses any day of the week. In addition, ignoring the difference in focal length my Panasonic/Leica f1.2 42.5 rivals my Otus f1.4 55mm for my Nikon (plus it has vibration reduction AND autofocus - eat your heart out Sigma). These high quality lenses are smaller and cost less than their full frame rivals to boot. Now there are some poor lenses too, but if you are willing to pay a little more I have found all of the Panny/Leica and Olympus Zuiko lenses to be very, very good.<br /><br />Other notes -<br /><br />  - If you shoot in RAW and use Lightroom you will have to update to 6.9.<br /><br /> -  The autofocus really is improved. It is very fast on the point.<br /><br />- Has the ability to do focus stacking - I haven't tried this yet - but it is a very interesting function.<br /><br /> - Shooting manual is a breeze - I am not sure why Nikon can't copy Panasonic's focus peaking, but if they could... they should.  I mentioned I owned the Otus f1.4 55mm.... that lenses would be soooooo much more useful if Nikon offered a similar type of focus peaking.<br /><br />- Low light performance - others may disagree, but I do think that it is better than the GH4. I have very good stills at ISO 1600. However, this might be a counter-intuitive since Panasonic is using the same sized sensor but increasing the resolution.  In order for the camera to have better low light performance and higher resolution would require either significantly better algorithms and/or improvements on the actual sensor gathers the light.<br /><br /> - Button placement and layout are still very solid. it is easy to navigate WB and ISO settings without moving your eyes (much more difficult on my Nikon D750).<br /><br />- No built in flash. Honestly, I can not remember the last time I used a built in flash.<br /><br />- The camera is not too much larger than the GH4, but it is noticeably heavier.  This camera is dense, and while it still has an advantage over my full frame it's losing ground here.<br /><br />Video-<br /><br />  - My early footage is excellent. The continuous autofocus is improved (although I do need to run a lot more tests on this one). I loved shooting footage with my GH4, but I usually filmed in manual focus. I never fully trusted the GH4 autofocus - it seemed to spend too much time searching.<br /><br />- The ability to shoot at 180 FPS (you have first select a variable frame rate to get into this menu).<br /><br />-  Out of the box it will allow you to record 10 bit straight to SD card (I recommend the new high transfer rate cards).<br /><br />- Image stability - I am very excited for the improvements - but I definitely need to do a lot of testing to see how it really performs.<br /><br />- In short...  for video the GH5 will do everything that GH4 will do, but it adds the ability to capture 10 bit footage directly to a SD card, offers weather protection, and in-body stabilization<br /><br />- The screen and viewfinder are excellent.<br /><br />Final Verdict - Again, I will have to update this review - there is MUCH still to be covered (especially for video). However, the early results are very promising and I do believe that Panasonic has made a significant improvement in IQ over the GH4. I may be naive, but I just ASSUMED it would be great for video (minor improvements in the GH4 would have helped maintain its status). The GH5 is roughly double the price of the GH4 so you will need to understand if the photo improvements and the upgrades in video are really worth it to you. For me... it is a no-brainer.... and I am optimistic that for now on I will be carrying just one camera with me!<br /><br />5 Stars","AMAZING.

It you have the GH4, upgrade to this one. If you are looking to shoot video in a handheld package, nothing comes even close to the GH5"]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot G9 X Mark II","amazon_reviews":["This is a great little camera. Honestly if you want the highest image quality in the smallest profile possible, this camera is it.<br /><br />Is it worth upgrading from the original though? I guess it depends on what's important to you. If you feel that you would use the in camera raw processing and more in depth adjustments for picture styles then its worth considering. While it's JPEGS are slightly sharper due to the newer processor, overall  image quality is about the same. The photos look great with excellent color reproduction and the auto white balance has improved a bit over its predecessor. Video quality is also very good.<br /><br />The overall layout of the camera is essentially the same at its predecessor. You only get one control dial and have to rely on the touch screen for the rest of setting adjustments. But as with other cameras, the touch screen works great so this might not be as big of a deal as it seems. Ergonomics are pretty good for such a small camera. With a nice textured surface up front for a more secure grip.<br /><br />Autofocus performance has improved over the original G9X, mainly in the form of being less sluggish and more accurate in low light conditions. Movie AF has improved a bit too with less back and forth motion while focusing over the original.<br /><br />Battery life has also improved like it did on the G7X Mark II. Although if you're taking this out for a long day of shooting, you still might pack an extra one. Enthusiast compacts in general don't have the greatest battery life.<br /><br />Overall, this is a likeable little camera that does photos and videos very well and is slim enough to fit in most pockets. Some may find the lens too restrictive as far as focal length is concerned but that's one of the tradeoffs you have to make when you stuff a larger sensor in a small camera body. If you have the original G9X, this is not the no-brainer upgrade. But if you're a new buyer to this series, it's worthwhile to spend the extra money to get the Mark II for the extra features and slight bump in overall performance it provides.","Really nice, if you like a tiny camera.  Fits into any pocket and takes beautiful pictures.  High quality item for such a tiny box.  I very much recommend.  A lot of options onboard as well.  This is a really loaded up device","Brilliant! Unexpectedly good. Actually great. Very happy to have found another great tool/companion for my video/photo work.","The Canon PowerShot G9 X Mark II is the updated version of Canon’s G9 X “entry level” premium compact camera. I was looking for a small camera to take along with me when I did not want to lug around a DSLR camera and lenses. After much research, I settled on the PowerShot G9 X Mark II and so far, I am very pleased with the results.<br /><br />The premium compact cameras give the user the option to manually control settings (shutter speed, aperture, ISO), while also offering the traditional “Auto” point and shoot mode, as well as other creative settings typically found on a point and shoot.  These cameras also feature a 1” CMOS sensor, which produces better images than a typical cell phone camera.<br /><br />Updates to the Mark II version include the Digic VII image processor, which means faster processing and continuous shooting times for JPEG and RAW photos (a maximum continuous shooting speed of 8.2 fps in RAW shooting mode). The Mark II also features dual sensing image stabilization, a quicker autofocus feature and improved subject tracking, auto shooting mode, and a slight improvement in battery life.<br />The Mark II also is Bluetooth compatible, a new feature (the camera also has Wi-Fi and NFC capabilities). Transferring photos from the camera to your phone is easy with the Canon Camera Connect app.<br /><br />I have used the camera for a few weeks and I like it. The camera is small (it can literally fit in my front pocket) and the large 3” touchscreen is relatively intuitive (the camera has a limited amount of buttons). The user can control mostly everything via the touchscreen, and I have found that visibility of the screen is still very good for daylight shooting.<br /><br />The lens range itself is limited, but what you lose in zoom you make up for in quality photos and compactness. The focal length in the lens of the Canon G9X II is 28mm-84mm, with a 3X optical zoom and a 12x digital zoo, which will produce grainy photos. Maximum aperture is F/2 at 28mm and F4.9 at 84mm. I have attached photos that show what is captured at 28mm, 50mm, 84mm and at maximum zoom. The zoom on this camera will not give you close ups of the moon. The lens barrel also has a ring, which can be used to control a variety of settings. There is no viewfinder.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this camera. The only negative at this point has been battery life, but the battery life I have experienced may have been comprised since I have been setting up the camera and using its various features. Still, it probably makes sense to buy and carry a spare battery if you are going to be out all day shooting. Highly recommended!","This is a great little camera.
