[{"name":"Olympus C-2040 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["Many will wonder why I wanted this camera now, with only 2.1mp when there are cameras out there with HUGE resolution and lots more bells and whistles. The answer is easy--I had this camera and lost it, and HAD to have another one like it (I actually bought TWO through AMAZON!!!)<br />This little camera comes with a 1.8 \"super-bright\" lens which permits me to take wonderful photos in very low light, without the flash. It takes crisp, lovely pictures, and for my purposes, has all the bells and whistles I need. I'm usually taking pix to be seen on the internet, or for small (4x6in) prints. If I were taking pictures for HUGE prints, or for reproduction into a magazine (ha!) then the better resolution available with higher megapixel count would probably be better.<br />I think I bought the only two available on Amazon, but I recommend it to anyone who can find one. MAKE SURE that the camera includes both the download cable, to import the pictures from the camera to your computer, and the AC connector cord, so that you don't have to waste your batteries downloading pictures using the camera's batteries.<br />In case you are unaware of this, downloading your pictures uses much more of your battery's charge than picture taking, too. If you use a card reader, of course this wouldn't even come into play. But if you DO download from your camera directly into your computer, be sure the seller includes the AC adapter cord.<br />This is, as far as I am concerned, \"The Little Camera that Could\" and I heartily recommend it.","Olympus makes great cameras!!!! This camera is an exact replacement for one that was stolen & I was so glad I found it's twin. Simple to use & not too many bells & whistles. The most important feature is the lens, because of the images the camera produces. The only downside is the difficulty finding memory cards(apparently they aren't made anymore). This is an excellent camera for those who still like to look through a view finder &/or have trouble holding a small digital one.","I own this camera and have used it for almost 3 years now.  It has been through Christmas, Easter, Birthdays, Anniversaries, trips to Yellowstone and Disney World.  I always get the best pictures.  The pictures my husband and I took at Yellowstone were phenomenal.  They rivaled many of the post cards we saw for sale, especially of the Lower falls.  This is a very easy point and shoot type camera.  I only wish the optical zoom was greater than 3X.","I have had this camera for around two years now. I am in the military and travel alot. I have used the heck out of this thing. It has never failed me. It provides wonderful pictures. I just bought the remote and am looking forward to trying it out. The one down side is: nothing. I did buy a usb smartmedia reader for PC. It sped up the download from the camera like crazy. That is a must. The supplied software is not the best though. It does often lock up my system. And I have a very up to date system.<br />This camera is a very very good one. It is very durable as well. I have flown all over the place toting this thing along my side and have bumped it here and there and never had even a little problem with it.","The Olympus C-2040 has been nothing short of perfect for my first digital camera.  It can be wonderfully simple for the point and shoot photographers, and it can also be set up for more complicated shots (adjusting shutter speeds, ISO, and many other things that can go over a tourist photographer's head)<br />If you want to jump into the digital camera market, and don't want to feel the need to replace a \"beginner's digital camera\" in a year or so this is absolutely the one.<br />Just make sure you buy a larger memory card to go with the camera.  You'll soon find that since you don't have to worry about running out of film you can take several shots of the same scene to hopefully get that perfect memory.","I wish to add further comments to my first review of this camera.  Now that I have had a chance to use it, I know that I made the right decision when I bought the Olympus C-2040Z.  I could not be more satisfied.  It takes some of the sharpest pictures these old eyes have ever seen, especially nature shots.  I have pictures taken by this camera and printed on my Epson C-80 printer that are National Geographic quality.  And I am talking about 8X10 prints in full living color.  This camera has more than met my expectations.  I cannot recommend it strongly enough.  The excellent review by Consumers Reports should help further convince anyone who might be trying to decide which camera is the one for him or her.","I bought this camera as my first digital camera, and I love it.  easy to download pictures to PC via usb.  Excellent features and settings.  Does use batteries up, but get some Lithium rechargeables.  Excellent picture quality, works well as point & shoot if you don't want to learn all about the other settings.  I mostly store & view images on CD/PC but print quality of pictures is high for smaller sizes ie: 4\"x6\", if you want to print lots of larger pictures, you may consider a higher pixel camera.  Overall great camera.","I have had this camera for less than two months, but I already know I bought a great camera.  After researching digital cameras for six months, talking to several people who have them, and reviewing what Consumers Report has to day, I settled on the Olympus C2040Z, which was one of the top rated cameras by CR for the money.  It takes absolutely great pictures, even at night without background lighting.  The color and sharpness are all that anyone could want.  Point and shoot - it couldn't be simpler.  This camera came with the super bright lense, which I highly recommend.  The menu is extensive, and I am sure I will be learning how to use the camera to its fullest potential for months and years to come.  So far, battery life has not been an issue.  I went through over 120 shots before having to change batteries.  I purchased a ZiO card reader with the camera which works great and helps conserve camera battery life.  It is a must-have accessory.  Bottom line:  I strongly recommend this camera.  One can hardly do better.","I just found and bought my Olympus c-2040 zoom after much research and deliberation.  I needed a digital camera first for my business and secondly for pleasure.  I will probably never print any pictures over 8 X 10 and need concise, clear pictures for my website so this is I feel the perfect choice.  I had a lot of trouble locating this camera - finally bought it ...from a reputable camera shop.  I paid [money] after s/h, insurance, and was very happy.  I researched Consumer's Report and every review in Amazon, etc. that I could find for 3 weeks before trying to find this camera.  It was difficult, but successful... I'm told it has been discontinued - probably because of it's success. Olympus can put this f1.8-2.6 lens in more expensive cameras, charge more, and GET IT!  The lens was what I was after.  I could have bought the c-3040 (same lens) for [money] more but it is actually more power than what I need.  The pictures taken from my 2040 are so crisp and clear.  The manual is actually more confusing than just picking up the camera and figuring it out.  I have Windows Me and all it took was a simple plug into the computer and it was there!  So simple!  I was actually fearful after reading the nightmarish reviews about uploading the pics to the computer and let me tell you, I'm NO computer wizard! It's easy, takes great pics in all light, feels good in my hands, and has most of the bells and whistles if you want them.  My previous hp-215 digital camera was a nightmare. The batteries were dead after 12 shots.  This camera is still on the original set of batteries and I've used it constantly since I got it!  This c2040 puts the hp215 to shame.  Do buy a smartmedia card though with more memory.  The one it comes with is just a freebie to practice with.","I spent weeks researching digital cameras and the more reviews I read, the more undecided I became. But, in the end I bought an Olympus C-2040 digital camera. The main reason why I decided on the C-2040 is the fact that it has the new super bright f1.8 lens. Digital cameras in general have had a history of taking poor quality pictures in low-light situations. The C-2040 and its bigger brothers the C-3040 and C-4040 have same super bright lens, which in my book is the best lens on the market for the price. The only disappointment that I have with the C-2040 is the fact that I have to use the SHQ mode to get anywhere near the quality of pictures that I desire. I am a graphic/web designer and I am by far so much pickier than what the average photo enthusiast would be. So, I have decided to return the C-2040 and I have ordered the 3.34 mega-pixel C-3040. The average user will be more than satisfied with the C-2040 and its list of features. However, if anyone is as picky as I am, I demand only the best in my images. In another year or two I hope to upgrade to a 4+ mega-pixel SLR digital camera and when I do, Olympus will be the first manufacturer that I will look to.","Many will wonder why I wanted this camera now, with only 2.1mp when there are cameras out there with HUGE resolution and lots more bells and whistles.

In another year or two I hope to upgrade to a 4+ mega-pixel SLR digital camera and when I do, Olympus will be the first manufacturer that I will look to.","I have owned this camera for about 8 months now and I just love it. It was simple enough for my Mom to use (and get great pictures) while allowing me to use more advanced features like Shutter/Aperture Priority to get really great photographs. The initial installation was a breeze on Win 98 and when I got a new computer with Win XP I still had no problems. You do not even need to use the Imaging software that comes with the camera. You just need the device drivers from the CD-ROM...All you have to do is attach the included USB cable to your PC, attach the Camera to the other end of the USB cable (while the camera is powered off), power on the camera, and a new drive has been added to your computer that you can drag and drop from. It really doesn't get any more simple that that.<br />The one feature I wish I had was a 10x optical zoom. The 3x optical zoom is a little weak for me but I can't complain because there are no other digital cameras in the same price range with a 10x optical zoom.<br />This is a great camera to take you from a beginner to advanced photographer.","The very fast f1.8 lens is great.  It allows many indoor pictures to be taken without the flash, which saves lots of battery power.<br />  The non-electronic view finder is a bonus when taking pictures in dark rooms or at night.  The c-700 has a electronic view finder that won't work (display anything) in dim lighting.  I used a c-700 at a wedding reception and it was point, guess and shoot... then try again.  I used my 2040 the other night outside taking a picture of my daughters building a snowman.  The dim light of the street light was was enough to find them in the view finder.<br />  Its fairly easy to use.  The 2.11 megapixel is a nice blend of picture quality and picture size on the Smartmedia card.<br />  The only thing I've had problems with is the movie mode and taking smooth movies.  I can't seem to hold the camera still enough and follow my daughters around the room at 100mph.  That could just be me though. I've only tried twice.","I can only say that I have had nothing but total satisfaction<br />with this camera.<br />It's easy to use and with the USB connection I can download<br />pictures in no time.<br />With 1600 x 1200 res. and 2.1 megapixels I have at least 30 pictures<br />of my own that I use for my desktop background picts that are<br />nice and sharp.<br />If your looking for a good compromise between price and quality,<br />this is the one.","A feature that often determines the price of a camera (film or digital) is the quality of the lens. Unfortunately, the general public looks at magapixel or zoom numbers. I think this is why Olympus is looking towards competing with those numbers as opposed to continuing to produce 2 megapixel cameras with fast/bright lenses (which I'm sure costs much more for them to make anyway). The 2040 is one of those. Doomed for \"close-out\", this camera in my opinion is the best combination of a great lens and perfect resolution - by perfect I mean a good balance of clarity and memory used. Bear in mind that many 2 megapixels can take better pictures than some 3 megapixels. From what I see in stores nowadays, Olympus no longer offers 2 megapixel cameras with their F1.8 lenses. None of the other brands offer a lens this fast/bright at any megapixel.  Buy one of these now while they still have it if you want a professional level camera at 2 megapixels, a resolution which is much more than what most of us need.","I really like this camera.  The operating instructions included a quick start page of just the necessary basics to get started taking pictures.  The more detailed instruction booklet was clearly written and included diagrams.  This was very helpful. The camera's controls are easy to use.  The picture quality in daylight or flash is very good.  I had a problem connecting the camera to my computer through the USB port.  My computer running Microsoft XP wouldn't recognize it and would freeze up.  The software that came with the camera did not seem to help.  I currently download pictures to the computer through my hp Photosmart printer which can read the smart card. A little round-a-bout, but workable for now.  Overall, however, I am very satified with the camera.","I would have given this camera five stars if I hadn't had so much trouble getting started.  The reviews point out the problem with the driver if you have Windows 98.  My computer is only 3 months old and has Windows Me.  When I tried to download pictures, Windows couldn't find the driver.  After trying the CD rom provided by Olympus and the system disk that came with the computer, I went to the Olympus website and downloaded the driver for Windows 98.  It still didn't work.  Frustrated, I called Olympus the next morning.  I was told that the first time it had tried to install the driver, it had done so improperly, so I had to delete that before it would run with the downloaded driver.  It took a half hour on the phone with an Olympus technician telling me step-by-step what to do before it would work.  The software that comes with the camera stinks.  I use another photo editing program.<br />That said, once it was up and running it's an amazing camera.  Even on full auto it takes amazing pictures under all kinds of conditions.  I took it to Florida and took pictures out a car window, in low light, on the beach and through glass in an aquarium -- all of the pictures are beautiful.  I'm just starting to learn how to use the more advanced functions.  It's a great camera to \"grow into.\"  It takes great pictures on the default settings while you learn how to adjust it yourself to get a desired effect.  I don't find the menus to be confusing once you've used the camera a few times.<br />The 8 MB card is a joke, I don't understand why they bother making and selling them.<br />I highly recommend this camera because of the lens and the quality of the pictures.  However, there's no excuse for the problems with the drivers and the awful software.  That said, I did a lot of research and this is, overall, an amazing camera.","Couldn't get the software to operate properly on either of two relatively new computers. Good news: The operating system seems to recognize the camera as an ordinary storage device and handle file management just fine, which makes the clunky software from Olympus mostly redundant. Love the camera!","Being new to the digital world of photography, the word intimidation leaps to mind.  This camera offers all the features and functionality that anyone would want, but does so with easy to use technology.  The camera produces amazing pictures, extremely fine quality for the images, and does so without requiring a college degree.  For the best of all worlds - easy to use, full featured, top quality -- pick this camera.","I was a reluctant convert to digital photograhy and settled on the C-2040 after carrying out extensive research. The clarity of the photos are fantastic and the colours are beautifully saturated. It is very well featured with a good selection of exposure modes and settings, including spot metering. The build quality is excellent and it feels very solid. I cannot go back to film after this!! The f1.8 lens and the ISO400 setting are particularly valuable, allowing you to take natural light photos in conditions that you wouldn't dream of with a film camera.<br />Complaints.. you'll need to get a decently sized memory card - 64mb is useful, and a rechargeable battery set.  It is not as pocketable as I thought it would be, and the lens cap is not integrated. The lens is not as wide as I'd like, though you can get adapters to fix that. You'll also miss the lack of sound on your quicktime movies. The Camedia software is not the best but it does the job. And finally, as with most digital cameras, you'll have to work around the slight shutter delay.<br />Overall though, the camera has given me nothing but joy! It has all the functions a typical enthusiast needs, with the control of a decent film SLR and the size of a reasonable compact snapshot camera. You may baulk at the initial cost of a digital camera, but as soon as you start downloading those pictures it will all start to make sense. For all photographers looking into the waters of digital photography, this is as good a place to jump in!","I just bought one of these. Finding one was a challenge in itself. When I told Amazon to email when the item was in stock, I received an email from Amazon that I never received before. I was told it would be a long time before they would be available. Why, because nobody beats this camera.<br />This camera sports the Super Bright 1.8 lense. This Olympus and the top of the line Olympus are the only two in the industry that have it. What it means is a larger opening, which lets in more light. Consequently, the auto shutter speed is faster, less chance to get a blurry shot. Also the background of the shot is brighter and more defined. I was in a camera store, the manager's personal camera was the C-2020, the predecessor to this one. He had shot a picture of a metal guitar, one with the 2040, and the other with the Nikon 950 (which is twice the money) He printed out a large 8\"x11\" glossy. Seeing them side by side, the definition in the shot was the same, I couldn't tell the difference, but the ivy leaves in the background surrounding the shot, were a lot brighter, instead of being dark and ill defined in the Nikon shot.<br />Consumer Reports rated the predecessor C-2020 Olympus as being the number one camera in printed picture results, knocking out even the 3 and 4 megapixel cameras quality. Imagine that, 2 megapixels, half the money, yet the best results. Sounds like an avalanche trying to get in the door on that one. Well CR just came out with the November 2001 issue, and guess what, the C-2040 did it again. Making the number one spot, and this time they gave it special mention, because the quality rivaled that of the 3's and 4's. Usually a print out at 5x7\" size is what the 2 megapixel cameras are good for. Not this one, the crystal clear shot I saw was an 8 1/2 by 11.<br />Ok, on to the camera. Some reviews, including CR, state that the menu was a little confusing. I did not find that to be the case. Shooting, zooming, previewing, deleting, downloading, etc is a breeze. When I tackle some of the more challenging tasks of manual settings, instead of the complete autofocus etc., maybe then I will learn what they are talking about.<br />The picture clarity is unbelievable. I took a few shots of some metal objects, and thought something was strange, their was little dots on the metal. Upon closer inspection, I realized it was the little flecks of dust. They were so clear blown up on a 19\" screen, something you would not see, little individual flecks of dust, bright and clear. The detail was phenomenal. The zoomed in upclose shot, looked like it was taken one inch away, and was larger than life. Like a real life microscope.<br />The panorama feature, which was previously a Canon exclusive is nice. You can take up to 10 pictures, across a landscape, or a room for example, and then the Camedia software which is included pastes them together, which creates a single panorama. If you sent this shot to a friend, they would receive one pic, that they could navigate around, to see the entire room.<br />One thing that really matters to me, is that this is also the best looking camera. It looks smart. Chrome body, with the larger black hub at one end was the style I was looking for before I learned of the C-2040. Many digital cameras have this metal early 50s look that I do not like. This camera is beautiful in its design.<br />When I first picked it up with its .6 of a pound weight, and relatively small size, I thought it was a toy camera. Then when I took the lense cap off, and turned the camera on, the zoom lense gently whirred when it came out, and it was an immediate feeling of, this is high tech. Oh by the way, having had a Nikon FE with 80-120 zoom, (I still do) I wanted a zoom that was more than 2x optical. That feature was available once again, on more expensive cameras. The C-2040 has a 3X optical. Zooming in, and filling the frame with your subject, makes for a interesting shot, and the 3x is very nice for that. The Olympus model that is directly above this one, has a 10x zoom, but it doesn't have the 1.8 lense. For those of us who were into the 35MM SLRs, know all to well that the cameras with the 1.5s were more expensive lenses, and the 1.2s made the lense look like it was all glass.<br />Also the 1.8\" LCD on the back is large, and crystal clear. Easy to read menu functions, and nice picture views.<br />A few final notes, be careful buying one of these for a cheaper price, make sure the camera you buy has the US guarantee. Gray market cameras come without the guarantee. Digital camera repairs are running a couple of hundred dollars these days, so the warranty is nice.<br />This camera also takes short movies, but they never replace a digital camcorder in that regard.<br />The optional remote control is way better than a timer, which this also has, if you want to get into the shot. That way, your not stumbing over things to get into the shot, and you can wait until the ideal moment to take it. Also, you can fire away multiple shots once you are there.<br />You definitely will want to get a larger smart memory card than the 8 meg they supply with the camera. A 64 meg is nice, and the 128 gives you over 300 shots in standard resolution. The panorama feature only works with Olympus cards, so be sure an pick up at least a 32 meg in Olympus and preferably a 64. Then go out and pick up an aftermarket 128 at a bargain, for relatively unlimited regular shooting. More than one card is advisable. Although the smart cards are pretty robust, going on vacation and discovering a defective card would be disasterous. So multiple cards, covers that base.<br />Additionally the rechargeable batteries are nice. A fast charger with a 2 hour charge time is great. The lesser expensive chargers are overnight chargers. You will want to pick up an extra set of 4 batteries, in  addition to the 4 that come with the charger. It is a good idea to keep the lithium batteries that come with the camera in your camera bag, because they will last a couple of years in storage, and always be there in case you get stuck without charged ones.<br />I bought two bags. One which is smaller, but large enough to hold the camera, batteries, and your smart cards, but not large enough to hold the charger, and your lunch. :-) I like that for local shoots and being small, it doesn't look like you were the hired photographer. The other one which is larger, for getaway weekends, is designed to hold your digital camera, with enough room for all of your gear, and even an SLR. Quantaray makes a nice black leather one for that. You may want to visit your local camera store, to actually see the style that most appeals to you, then come back to Amazon to take advantage of the prices.<br />Their is an available AC adapter, but I chose to buy a stand alone Smart Card reader, that reads and writes. You park it on your desk, leave it plugged into the computer. Saves you from wearing out the electronics on the camera, and batteries don't become an issue. The one I bought is 10 dollars more but it reads and writes, that way I can download pictures from the computer also into the card, and then show them at my destination using the combined slide show feature, and the included cord to hook it up to any TV. Great for presentations.<br />I guess I am getting kind of windy. I am just in love with this camera. Having had a 1 megapixel Sound Vision 209 Mini Cam with a fixed telephoto range, and limited capabilities for indoor shots, this camera is a quantum leap. The super bright lense, gives you great low light picture taking ability. Coupling that with an adjustable \"ISA\" setting of 100, 200, or 400, makes it all the more effective for different conditions. I had heard a professional photographer complaining of having only an equivalent of ASA 100 fixed setting on his Canon Digital elph, he obviously wasn't introduce to the C-2040.<br />Using the camera with your PC is a breeze. You plug in the USB cable, or use the smart card reader I just mentioned, then just go into my computer, and you will see a new drive called removable drive. You click on it, and instantly see the file names of all of your pics. You can copy and paste the whole bunch into a new folder, they copy real quick, then just edit-select all, hit delete, and they are wiped from the cameras memory. A true Windows intuitive interface.<br />Store managers personal use camera, Consumer Reports number one pick in the 2 megapixel category, and they are just plain back ordered at most places, shows you that this camera is the one to get.<br />These features and quality at this price is a winner, considering that you will be picking up 150 to 250 dollars of extras no matter what model you buy. So it makes this one a nice comfortable price point. I know with the money I saved over buying a 4, is enough that I can probably pick one of those up in a year or two for the difference. Although I don't know why I would want one, considering the amazing quality of the C-2040.<br />I'm in love with the camera, did I already say that? Find one and check it out. You will see what I mean.","Purchased with a 128MB flash card, which gives about 120 low-compression JPEG 1600x1200 images.  I'm very happy with the image quality, but it takes the camera about 1.5 seconds to focus & shoot from initial shutter press, which is too slow for my style.  However, you can pre-focus by holding the shutter down halfway which reduces the shoot time to about 0.1 sec.<br />The autobracket, white balance, priority and full manual, and flash intensity features are welcome (and necessary for many shots), but it takes a lot of button pushing to access them in the menus.<br />I don't have much use for the QuickTime movie feature; the 320x240 resolution is too low to be useful and it eats RAM like crazy.<br />If you buy this camera, I highly recommend you also purchase the Olympus CLA-1 lens adapter tube and a 43mm filter for same, to get some armor on the delicate zoom lens.","This was my first experience with a digital camera. I'm not very electronic/camera savey, but I love to take photos-scenes, grandkids,,everything. I wanted something that gave me the chance to use black and white as well as color. Altho I still need to refer back to the book at times(which is small enough to be carried in my purse) I found the various settings somewhat easy to use. All in all, I like this camera.","This is our first digital camera.  (...)we researched a lot of cameras over the last 3 weeks and picked the 2040.  It works as well as advertised, with picture quality as we expected.  The picture quality was the deciding factor, and I think it can be attributed to the 'Super Bright' camera lens.  Low-light pictures are excellent, in fact better than my SLR (this may say more about my photographic skills, but you get the idea).  We also decided on sticking to cameras in the 2 megapixel range. For those who are new to digital camera, 2 megapixels will allow you to print photo quality pictures up to 8x10 inches.  This is adequate for most people.<br />Pros:<br />* Super Bright lens works as advertised - low light and natural light pictures are excellent.<br />* Picture quality is superb - most of our pictures have been taken with the 3rd highest quality mode and look great.  This allows for 128 photos on a 64mb memory card.<br />* Can be used as a point-and-shoot or fully manual camera.<br />* Flash has degrees of brightness you can manipulate.<br />* Photo transfer with USB port is quick and easy - the camera appears in My Computer as a Removable Drive, allowing you to look into the camera like any other folder, copy and paste the images and even delete them from the camera.<br />Cons:<br />* USB link has not worked as advertised in Windows 2000 but works like a dream with Windows 98.  I went to the Olympus website, where there are NO troubleshooting recommendations for Windows 2000 - just Windows 98.  So I emailed tech support, and he writes back with copies of the Windows 98 instructions I found, obviously not paying attention to the fact that I designated my OS as Windows 2000, had specific questions, AND that I had sent the link of the instructions I had found - the same information he emailed to me.  I asked for further assistance, and that was a week ago (the first response took 2 days).<br />* Remote not included ... The timer can be used in the meantime.<br />* No 'sepia' mode.  (You can tell we're trying to find faults...)<br />This camera is probably the best bang for the buck out there.  ...All in all, an excellent first camera and a true value.","Other reviewers have wrote at lenght about the technical aspects of this camera, you should read them. My c-2040 has been wonderfull as well. I like very much the lens wich is very clear, allowing pictures imposible with other cameras. It also has a lot of pro options wich makes it great afterwards. The learning curve is a little bit steep with some of the options, but  the manual is very informative (yes , you have to read it) .I was amazed by the fact that this camera  use the same interfase of the Olympus E-10 digital SLR, the only difference being the fact that the E-10 puts almost all the controls as buttons (great: you don't have to go in to a menu to change options before a shot).<br />Do buy two 4 reachargeable batteries sets and a fast charger, this puppy eats power like crazy .","This is my first digital camera.  So far it has been excellent.  If you can read.....then it is not difficult at all to set up and start using the camera.  In under 30 minutes, I had unpackaged the camera, installed batteries, taken pictures, erased pictures, shot in movie mode, loaded pictures on computer and printed a photo, not bad for a novice!  Being a novice, I almost did not buy the 2040 based upon a few reviews stating it was too complicated, it is not, as stated earlier, just take a few minutes and read the quick start instructions. Enjoy!","I had been wanting a digital camera for a while and had my eye on the 2040. I take a lot of pictures just for fun and film processing cost and delay were killing me. I wish I had bought one of these sooner.<br />I've had mine for a week and I love it. I took a few test pics just using the default options and then connected the USB cable to my WinME PC. My PC then recognized the camera and then started my photo software. I was then able to manage the pictures on the camera as though it were a connected disk drive. I did not have to use the included software. The images look as good as the ones on my 35mm film camera.<br />I also bought the optional 64MB memory card which gives me 128 HQ or 306 SQ1 shots. That's plenty for a day's work!<br />The only downside is that lens cap. If it's on when you power up the camera balks as it tries to extend the lens. The AC adapter also seems a bit pricey but it looks like one of those have to have items.","After several WEEKS of browsing camera websites for reviews and doing research, I finally chose to purchase the Olympus 2040 camera, and I must say, I have been very happy with it.<br />This thing has so many options that it will take you quite a while to figure out everything it can do.  Full manual control is great, and the exposure lock is very handy.<br />In terms of batteries, make sure you buy some NiMh rechargeables for it - try thomas distributing ..  it seems to last quite a while on these.<br />No complaints!","As I said, I would have stopped after giving it 5 stars but decided to write the review as well as to make sure you buy it. No, I do not work for Olympus!<br />You can take pictures with incredibly natural colors under incandescent, fluoroscent and cloudy-sky light conditions - WITHOUT a flash! Something many pros would have trouble with using a film camera and filters. I am also doubling my other reviewer friend's comment that 2.1 and 3.3 megapixel line up eye to eye except if you plan to PRINT larger than 8x10 inch or view full size on a 30 odd inch monitor. The other exception is that a 3.3 or better is useful if you plan to enlarge a relatively small portion of a shot. Otherwise, save your money. Do look at the C-700 though if zoom is a priority.","I had my C450Zoom for almost 2 years. A friend \"broke\" it for me...so had to buy a new camera.  I was wavering between C2040 and C3040...but since I'm not planning on printing too many 8x10's, went for the C2040.  I've been very happy so far.  The first adjustment is getting used to the lens cap.  Second is the multitude of options added since the early days!  I changed my default resolution from 1600x1200 to 1024x768.  The latter is just fine for 4x6 prints (which is mostly what I get).  Plus, it allows many more prints on the same storage card.  The quick time movie option is fun!  No audio, but the video looks like old time movies.  It is just fun. Period.  I bought some filters & extra lenses, but since the standard lense expands out 2\" from the body, you need an extension to put on an extra lense.  That is fine except if you use the viewfinder to take the shot, the length does cut into your view. Weird!  Probably not worth getting extra lenses unless you are way serious.  I have been \"beating\" up the camera over the last 3 weeks and the supplied batteries have not died (3CRV?)  I have found that the instructions are straight-forward...but the manual is quite large (compared to the C510).  I bought the C510 for a first-time digital friend.  I am sure glad I bought the C2040Z!...","I bought the Olympus Camedia 2040 about a month ago.  I don't think I've ever been more pleased with a purchase in my life.  The C-2040 has everything I could want for a reasonable price.  To give you an idea of how much I use this camera, on a two week vacation, I took over 200 pictures.  It's wonderful!  The lens allows for shots in extremely low light conditions, both zooms allow you to get exactly the shot you want without moving yourself around, and the LCD screen lets you compose the photo before you take it.  I love all the options the C-2040 has.  It allows you to edit photos after they've been taken, choose all kinds of options for different types of shots, and play around with settings such as getting more blue or red in a photo.  I find I can do more \"editing\" on the camera than on the Camedia software!  Finally, I recently ordered prints from a photo place online.  Although they're much more expensive than film prints, you only order exactly the photos you want in hardcopy.  They turned out beautiful.  I never would have known that the prints were digital.  Now the downsides. . .Firstly, the C-2040 comes with an 8 megabyte smartmedia card.  Ugh!  You only get 16 photos with it.  As other people did, I went out and bought a 32 megabyte card.  This allows you to take 64 pictures at once.  Secondly, the batteries that come with the camera are not rechargeable.  Practically every two days, more batteries are needed.  I bought two sets of NiMH rechargeable batteries and a charger.  This works fine.  Third, the LCD display shows the picture that will be recorded on the smartmedia card, but the normal viewfinder (the one used on film cameras) is not always accurate.  To avoid problems, I use the LCD screen all the time.  Fourth, the software that comes with the camera is not very useful.  The feature for bringing in photos doesn't seem to work for me.  I just use Windows Explorer to put the files where I want them.  Also, the software's nice for viewing your photos, but not for doing much editing.  As other people have said, a good paint program would do a lot more.  Fifth, to protect your camera, you need to get a case.  You can get a nice one for $16 in a local camera store.  Despite its little quirks, though, I LOVE this camera.  It is definitely worth buying.","This is a great camera for a serious or semi-serious amateur that wants full control of all the camera settings and rarely needs to print pictures larger than 8x10 inches.  If you commonly desire larger photos you should stick with film or look for a camera with a higher resolution (e.g., a 3+ Megapixel Olympus).  Olympus cameras are known for the quality of their optics and this model carries on that tradition.  The F 1.8 lens will allow you to shoot good pictures in situations which would be much too dark for many digital cameras.  I highly encourage you to go with the F 1.8 lens.<br />I have used the camera in a variety of settings from full daylight to multi-slave flash photography in caves and have gotten wonderful pictures everywhere.  The pictures that I have had professionally printed on traditional photo paper have been awesome, and the colors are great.<br />I highly recommend this camera for the serious amateur that wants a small, feature-packed camera to carry instead of, or in addition to, your SLR.<br />Things I really like:<br />1)  The optical quality and color depth of the pictures. 2)  The ability to completely customize the default camera settings  3)  The number of optional accessories that Olympus produces for the camera 4)  The include video out cord for hooking the camera up to your TV. This is great for showing your pictures of to family and friends after a trip.<br />There are a few minor things about the camera that you should be aware of:<br />1)  The LCD screen for viewing pictures is 1.8 inches which is on the small side (but comparable to many competitors cameras)<br />2)  If you turn the camera on without first removing the lens cap the camera will have a fit!!<br />3)  There is no bulb setting and the longest exposure you can set is for 16 seconds<br />4)  Unlike its 3 Megapixel cousins, Olympus does not include the RM-1 remote control with the camera.  Buy it separately . . . if you do tripod work or will use the included video cord to show your pictures on your television.","I'm not up on the technical jargon, but I know what I like. And I like this camera! Unlike some previous reviewers, I've had NO problem with any aspect of installation and use. It worked like a charm right out of the box. Coupled with my new Phillips CD-RW I have been able to create a great system for storing pics on CD. And the camera itself is a breeze to use. The pics are great, and even at the lowest quality resolution, I can print a great 8 x 10 photo. I have been using NiMH rechargeable batteries, and they lasted for a month with lots of use. I find that the 32 mg card is plenty for me, and I can't think of anything else I would need for great pics with total ease of use. I highly recommend this to anyone!","I purchased the 2040 a few weeks ago and looked forward to taking it on vacation. Truthfully, the software [stinks]. Windows 98 didn't recognize the driver even though I followed every step to the letter. I still haven't figured out why the default file type is effjpg or something instead of a true jpg file. Then there is the 8 mg smart media card. Totally worthless unless you plan on carrying about 8 of them. I can't believe they waste money making those cards. I bought a 64 mg card which was very sufficient if used wisely. I knew I was going to take some web pictures so I took them on low quality. The pictures that I thought had potential, I took on high quality. And the lithium batteries!! Cool!!! I haven't worn them out yet but I did have to go purchase rechargeables and a charger for when they do. But, you aren't supposed to download pictures on the batteries so you have to go buy an AC adapter too. No they don't tell you what the voltage is but you can buy off brand adapters that are specifically made for Olympus cameras. I guess that's it unless you want a camera case. I am proud to say that of all the accessories that I purchased NONE were OEM Olympus. Now if you can get through all that [crud], the camera takes wonderful pictures. The menus can be a pain but after a week of use I can breeze right through them to change any settting. The main reason that I purchased the 2040 was because of the f1.8 lens and the 3.0 optical zoom. This camera takes great pictures in really low light. Sometimes it can be a problem though because a fringe evening shot can look a bit brighter than it really is. I would have given this camera five stars if the software worked right and rechargeable batteries/charger were included. I am very happy with the quality of the pictures.","This is my first digital camera bought after researching the web reviews. I took 16 pictures at a 4th of July parade and the results were fantastic. It's easy to use the default mode and just point and shoot with excellent results of clarity and color saturation. I made 2 4x6 prints on my HP 932 and people couldn't believe these weren't photo lab quality. I tried the software on a Windows 95 computer and couldn't get it to work (possibly no Windows 95 driver on the disk) but my Windows ME with USB had no problem with fast downloads.","Wow is this camera cool.  Honestly I have never even owned a camera before because I was just to lazy to deal with the hassles of getting film developed, I always borrowed a relatives. However, the picture quality is just intense and I am thrilled to death by it. The camera is also small and lightweight which was a major buying decision. Also the fact that it only uses double AA batteries was also great, since I didn't want to worry about finding special batteries when traveling.  It did take me an hour or so to get it set up, but's that probably because I am a novice when it comes to cameras, but within an hour or two I was taking great pics and using the quicktime feature for short animations.  If you haven't stepped up to a digital camera your missing out, just the money I saved in one day from taking pictures nearly paid for the camera itself in film developing costs. Right now I am snapping pictures of everything, the trees, the dogs, the little elves on the front lawn, I could never afford to do this with regular film...is it cool!!!!!","First of all, I do not see any complication to learn how to operate the camera and installing the software. I think the quickstart and the thick detail menus already clear enough to get you started. I came very close to get the canon elph s110 due to its compact design, but the quality is not as good as the c-2040, such as the lens quality and aperture/shutter speed settings, its flash is also weak compare to the c-2040. This camera is really perfect for the price. Its picture quality is really amazing. It also has a lot of settings and allows you to shoot quicktime movie clips as well. If you are looking for a digicam for around 500 dollars, this is your best choice.","I have had this camera for about two weeks and absolutely love it.  It is extremely easy to set up and use.  Very intuitive, so you can have success if you just skim the manual (my method).  The images are terrific.  I purchased a SanDisk USB thingy which is a much simpler way to transfer the images to my computer than by hooking up the camera, and keeps me from having to have an AC/DC adapter for the camera.  I don't use the Olympus for video, so the lack of sound is not a huge deal for me.  The price is right, the technology is great and I could not be happier.","I learned photography on an SLR, so in looking for my first digital camera, I was frustrated to find that most digital cameras in the price range I was looking for were point-and-shoot. In addition to an idiot-proof mode that is good for when you're not looking for a great deal of photographic control, this camera has Aperture priority, Shutter priority, and a manual mode that allows you to control both. I was thrilled to find a camera with these features for under $500!<br />The optics on this camera aren't the greatest. An aperture of 1.8 @ 40mm is OK, and enables one to shoot in some pretty low-lighting situations as well as take some cool low depth-of-field pictures, but with a maximum f-stop of 10, high depth-of-field shots are compromised, and sunny conditions yield little control. The shutter speeds leave a little to be desired as well, ranging from 4 seconds (useless without a place to put a cable release!) to 1/800 of a second.<br />I don't know how they compute a focal range of 40mm-105mm to be \"3x,\" but it is pretty adequate. I don't understand the benefit of some of these super duper zoom cameras: unless you're using a tripod and cable release, or you're shooting at a very high shutter speed, there's no way you can hold the camera steady enough to take a crisp photo. There is also a digital zoom, but that is nearly useless on any camera: all it does is \"enlarge\" the pixels. If you can get your paws on a copy of Photoshop, it is MUCH better for zooming and cropping photos.<br />Being able to select the ISO speed myself makes it easier to make the transition to digital photography, but I don't understand why there would only be 100, 200, and 400 ISO equivalencies available on this camera.<br />If you can afford a more expensive camera, you may be able to get more control, but if this is your price range, then this is THE digital camera to get. You won't find more for your money in any other camera.","The 2040 comes with just the right amount of manual features to do some really interesting stuff.  It takes amazing pictures in low light and has great resolution.  I only wish the batteries lasted longer and the lens cap stayed on better.  I recommend this camera wholeheartedly to beginners and advanced amateurs alike","I really like this camera, which has very good optical elements (an F1.8 equivalent lens) which is not seen in many lower-end digital camera. The light-gathering power is very good... and I even snapped shots off of a screen showing slides (with flash turned off), and only held by hand; it worked!<br />The 2.1 megapixel image is plenty for the average user. This results in a shots that are about 405kb set on default settings (though you can change this), and images that are about 12\" by 20\" (can't remember exactly)... such that when they are printed the resolution is excellent (even to 8x10)! I saw 5 x 7 printed enlargements that I defy anyone to tell that they came from a digital camera.<br />The menu system on the back screen is a bit confusing, but one gets used to it fairly quickly. A remote control might have been nice, but the timer-delay feature sort of obviates the need.<br />My only real trouble was setting up the software/cable for downloading images (and ended up calling Olympus); the \"Camedia\" software is nearly worthless and I prefer to use PaintShopPro7 to edit shots (and any good graphic-editing program would work fine). Basically, you install a CD-ROM in your computer and it walks you through a procedure whereby you end up with a \"removeable disk\" entry in Windows Explorer (only when the camera is plugged in). The manual didn't clearly explain that. You simple open flap hatch on the side of the camera and plug in the cable (which you can leave attached to the USB port on your computer).<br />As an aside, be advised that most digital cameras have a optical view-finder that does not fully \"agree\" with digital one. Only looking at the digital image preview will truly tell you what you are about to shoot. Of course, one can edit their shots later on a computer (croping, etc.)<br />One MUST buy two additional things: 1) at least a 32mb SmartCard (the 8mb is good for about 16 shots) 2) a metal-halide battery pack and re-charger (and I'd only use the Olympus battery pack that came with it as a back-up set) 3) some sort of case (which the camera does NOT come with)... get one to also carry spare batteries and memory cards.<br />All and all, in a sea of competing digital cameras, I really like this one. A good compromise.","The camera comes with an easy set up extra instruction sheet.  Easy?  Sounds good. First the Olympus batteries wouldn't fit. Wife says \"Take it back\" Finally a VERY hard push got them in.  Second the SmartMedia memory card wouldn't connect. Wife says \"Take it back\" Finally a hard push got it in.  Third was setting the time.  This was a major production due to the very complex menu.  \"Wife says \"Take it back\"  Finally it's time, maybe, to take a picture.  Turned camera on.  No picture on the back screen. Hmmmm, this is not good.  Re-read the easy set up extra instruction sheet word for word.  Wife says \"Take it back, it doesn't work\"  Finally in very tiny print we find that there is a \"monitor\" button.  Take some snaps.  So far this was the easy part.  Installed the Camedia software on PC which comes with virtually zero documentation.  Plugged in the USB cable and camera.  Win98SE sees camera but doesn't find a driver.  Easy set up instruction says nothing about software or drivers.  The thick, mostly foreign language instruction book says see driver instructions on the Camedia disk.  I look and look and look.  No driver instructions could be found on the disk.  Based on previous PC experience I point Win98SE to the Camedia disk sub sub directory for drivers.  Win98SE finds driver. Whew. All is good, so I think.  Boot up Camedia and attempt to transfer pictures from camera to Camedia.  NO GO.  Camedia can't find camera.  Call a friend for help.  Friend tells me actually the camera is now just another hard drive.  Shut down the worthless Camedia and let Windows98SE go find the new Olympus hard drive.  FINALLY I find the snaps on the Olympus drive and insert the snaps into some family email.  Time to call it a very long night.","I love my Olympus 2040. It takes awesome pictures at a great price. The colors are true and the detail is phenomenal. I bought it over the C-3030 or any other 3.3 megapixel camera because unless you're going to print pictures LARGER than 8 x 10, those extra 1.2 megapixels are a waste. 2.1 megapixels fits more pictures on a memory card, too. On my 128 mb card you can take 257 pictures at the default 1600 x 1200. A 3.3 megapixel camera could only fit 164 or so at its default resolution. 2.1 is actually the smarter buy! (3.3 megapixels can only print sharper pictures than 2.1 when PRINT size EXCEEDS 8 x 10. Below 8 x 10, it's virtually impossible to tell the difference between a print from a 2.1 megapixel camera and a 3.3 megapixel camera.)<br />If you're considering the 2040, though, you might want to check out the C-700. you get sound with the movies (no sound on the 2040) and best of all a 10x optical zoom. The 2040 only has a 3x optical zoom (3x is equivalent to about 85mm, 10x is equivalent to 185mm traditional 35mm zoom lens. 3x zoom is merely \"fine\", nothing to jump up and down over.) Plus the C-700 has a new menu structure, although the 2040's really isn't that difficult if you spend some time with it.<br />Be sure to add in the cost of a 64 mb SmartMedia card, though. The 8 mb card is just a waste of time unless you bump down the resolution to, say, 1024 x 768, which you can do in the menus. I recommend you buy at least one Olympus brand 64mb card since only Olympus brand cards can make use of the fun \"stitch\" panorama feature in the Camedia's software. You'll probably only use this feature once in a while, but when you do want to do a panorama (like I did atop the Eiffel Tower) it would be nice not to have to fuddle with changing to the tiny 8mb Olympus card.<br />Other niceties: The 2040 while it doesn't come with a remote, is remote capable. Remote operates zoom and shutter. The lens cap now comes with a cord unlike its predecessors. The flash can be turned off, forced to flash all the time, or be set to auto. Also has red eye reduction.<br />Dislikes: Power saver mode cannot not be turned off. Even with the LCD screen off, after a while the camera goes into snooze mode and takes a second or two to be available. If you hand your 2040 to someone to take your picture, be sure to wake it up for him, or like me, he'll end up confused as to why your camera isn't working. This is easily gotten around by anticipating a shot.<br />ONE YEAR UPDATE:  I've had the 2040 for a year now and I still love this camera.  I've taken over 1,000 pictures and haven't had a single problem with it.  I did find out that the Camedia software (ver. 2.5) must have memory limitations, though.  I had about 550 pics in one folder (I'm building a house and collecting photo evidence in case the builder tries to gyp me)  and it just couldn't handle that many without crashing when I tried to run the slide show.  Simple solution was just to divide my collection into folders.  Buy this camera.  It's great!","I have a C-2020, which is a slightly older version of this camera model.  This has been a fantastic camera both in terms of quality, reliability and battery life.  Between some friends and myself we have just about every model in this family (C-2000 through C-3040) and we all love our cameras.<br />Quality: I have taken hundreds of shots, mostly outdoor.  I tend to shoot at the high-quality jpeg level so I bought a 64MB smart media card.  Paired with my HP DeskJet 952 I regularly printout 4x6 prints on photo paper that are absolutely perfect.  I have printed a few 8x10 pictures and they are fantastic.  No one can believe they were taken with a digital camera.  I have to zoom in quite a ways with my photo editing software before I can see any pixels.  The only negative thing I can say is that I wish it had a better macro mode.<br />Reliability: It has been rained on, splashed by a wave, and dropped a short distance onto a rock.  Despite all this it is still going strong a year and several hundred pictures later with no negative affects.<br />Batteries: I use the rechargeable batteries and during heavy use they last 2-3 weeks.  During light use they last 3-6 months.  Compare this to most Kodak or Nikon cameras that last a few days of heavy use.<br />A few comments on my accessories:<br />Forget the 16MB card that comes with it.  I keep only mine as a back up.  You will want a 64 MB smart media card.<br />I bought the Olympus T-CON14 tele-converter lens 1.45x (152mm equivalent) and I am very happy with it.  It can retail up to $200 but I shopped around on-line (I went to cnet.com and looked under \"Latest Prices - Camera Accessories - Lens\") and found it for around $79.  My next purchase is the wide-angle lens.<br />I bought the Olympus Accessory Kit (which is the same for C-2000 through C-3040 models), mostly for the UV filter, adapter tube and 43mm-55mm step-up ring, and AC adapter.  I bought it for about $95, which is close to what all those things cost separate.  The mini-tripod, software, and case that come in that kit are not overly impressive but I considered those `free'.  The lens cleaning kit is handy.","I love the reviews by people that have purchased this camera.  I just ordered it along with a bundled kit that contains a 32Mb card, charger, case and batteries.  The only unfortunate part is that I found mine through ZDnet for $100 LESS.","This camera has been terrific thus far.  I have owned it since February of this year, after it was first became available in the US.  (It is my first digital camera)<br />The photo quality is great, and of course you can instantly re-take any pics that don't meet your standards.  I find it very easy it use and the menu fairly easy to navigate.  I have had a lot of success manually varying the shutter speed and opening settings when in low-light or fast-speed settings where the camera's auto-focus doesn't cut it.<br />I recently purchased a 64-MB smart media card to use for this camera.  On the HQ setting (mid-quality = great for normal size photos, maybe not for blow-ups), I can take 128 photos with this camera.  With the 8-MB card that comes with the camera, you can manage 16 HQ pics.<br />This camera is a great value for someone who wants the versatility and ease of a digital camera, as well as the quality you would expect with a higher-end model.  This model has some great expansion capability too...","I just bought the Olympus C-2040 camera and I think it is a great camera at a reasonable price. The software that came with it is very confusing and I use another brand instead. The lens cap must be taken off before you turn it on or you will be chasing it on the floor.As far as the menu goes its pretty much explains itself.Also buy another card for it, the 8 MB card will not hold much in the fine mode.","This camera was a birthday gift. I had asked for a digital point-and-shoot but my husband, a photography instructor, thought better and bought a camera with manual modes.  The camera is a joy to use and takes beautiful photos outdoors and in, with the default JPG format of 1200x1600 pixels.  This is fine if the biggest you want to go is 5 x 7 (8 x 10 if you're not picky).  If you're an amateur, like me, turn the blasted flash off and go with natural light, but remember to adjust the ISO \"film\" speed up accordingly (the default is 100). All compact flash units are a pain, though this does have an option for a separate flash.  Yes, rechargable batteries and an AC adapter are must-haves.  Leave the camera plugged into AC while the batteries recharge so you don't lose the date/time settings you've entered.<br />The parallax distortion in the viewfinder is different from what is described in the instructions -- if doing closeups, use the monitor to center the composition.<br />The nested menus to control the various functions are confusing, my only real complaint about this camera (other than the \"lens cap of doom\" that you MUST not leave on).  You will live with the manual for a while.  Laminate the flimsy paper covers, it gets dogeared fast.<br />The Camedia Master software is confusing -- you click on the \"download pictures\" menu and get a message that there's no communications with the camera!  Obvious this feature must work with some other Olympus camera.  Same message if you click on the little \"my camera\" icon.  The software sees the camera up as a removable drive, and you have to drill down two levels to get to the pictures.  Once there, you can just drag and drop the pix like any other file in Windows.  For that matter, you can just drag and drop in Explorer, if you don't want to look at the thumbnails.  A serious amateur will need to get better editing software, like Photoshop, to manipulate the captured images.  Make sure you program the camera with date and time, otherwise all images are given a date of 01/01/00, very confusing, and the default names will overlap (default names include the date it was taken).<br />All in all, a very nice camera.","This is my third digital camera - and I absolutely LOVE it. I'm not going to go into how great it is, because you can read that anywhere... There's just one or two small things that I would like changed about this camera.  The first is one I didn't read anywhere - the lens cap.  MAKE SURE YOU TAKE IT OFF BEFORE SWITCHING THE CAMERA ON!!!  Otherwise the lens will try to extend and not be able to, and it will make a horrible noise that sounds like the camera is being damaged - and for all I know, it might be. Also... it EATS batteries, and they don't tell you what its AC power consumption is so you HAVE to but their ($) AC adapter, instead of using one you probably already have. Also, it's difficult to find a suitable camera bag as it's an unusual size and shape. But despite all this - I still think it's a great camera - the best I've owned so far.","This is a wonderful camera.  The instructions that come with the camera are at once complete and concise.  It is versatile, it can take motion pictures, it is totally adjustable allowing for wonderful artistic control, and the price is very reasonable."]},{"name":"Olympus C-3040 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["I have had  similar camera  for  years..  it  became un useable and desired  same one.. this camera always served my needs  -- thanks","made over 200,000 photos with it ... this camera made me decide to get the canon eos m camera, since i have canon lenses and a canon 30d, which i use all the time , but cant take it with me everywhere, as i did this olympus ... like they say, big cameras like my canon 30d stay home 95% of the time .... i recently got the canon 2500 pocket camera, but its very slow when you press down the shutter ... memories, many photos with this little olympus are on my facebook page ... and i posted a photo of my doc of homeopathy, who brings people back to life from cancers to lupus ...","I was able to get this camera cheap for about $56.00 and it included a 128mb card and it was in flawless shape.

Olympus 5050 made identical pictures and although it had more features and accepts more card formats I was not able to justify the upgrade.<br />This showed me I made a right choice purchasing this camera.","This camera is incredible! With all the features it's one of the lowest priced and versitile camera's I've found (and I did alot of research before purchase). It's got BW, sephia, white board, black board and normal modes.

It's very easy to attach things like a wide angle or telescopic lens with a tube adaptor. It's a 3.3 megapixel camera, but Olympus has a better quality 3.3 than other cameras (I know, 3.3 is 3.3, but the pictures speak for them selves). It's got a tripod mount, timer, red-eye reduction, and remote control (that's right, it's got a remote control). It's got 3X optical zoom (meaning it uses lenses to zoom) and 2.5X digital zoom (meaning it blows up the image losing resolution). On top of all this, mine has taken a helluva beating (extreme cold, droppage, even mud), but there's no stopping it! You will love this camera!","I have owned this camera now for several years. Takes great pictures. Lots of creative options when using. It just takes some time to learn them all. Only negative comment is that flash does not seem to carry for long distance. Pictures tend to be on the dark side. Close up flash pictures are great.","Very seldom do I purchase an item that meets expectations based on manufacturers specifications and claims.

I just bought this camera ... (factory refurbished).  I've owned Sony FD88, FD91, and Nikon 950 and without a doubt, this is the absolute BEST camera I've ever owned!  The shots it takes are phenomenal!  These shots coupled with a photo quality printer (I use an Epson 820) are as good or better than film.  I'm no phoographer...I consider myself a point-and-shoot kind of guy but the pictures I've taken with this camera have all turned out great.<br />I think the users guide is well written.  It's not as difficult as one would think being that it's over 200 pages.  The menu is easy to navigate as well.  Battery life is fine but I recommend purchase of rechargable batteries because once you find out how easy this puppy is to use, you're gonna take a lot of pictures!  The fact that the camera has quicktime movies makes it that much better.  I use a card reader to transfer my pictures to the PC and it's done almost instantly.<br />The only bad thing I would say about this camera is that the Zoom isn't long enough.  Maybe I'm spoiled because I'm used to those huge lenses on the Sony products but the Sony camera's  take poor action shots and you have to use Photoshop extensively to blow-up the shots to get decent 8 X 10 pictures.  The type and quality of the shots taken with this camera more than make up for the lack of zoom.  Plus, I've already ordered a 2X zoom to partially make up this deficiency.<br />All and all a super camera and now with the prices so low...you gotta get one.  There can't be too many cameras out there for [price amount] that can match this outstanding piece of electronics!","Pros:<br />-Very fast 3.3 frames per second, size, weight, full use of manual settings up to 1.8f.<br />Cons:<br />-Viewfinder is not lined up with lens causing your shot to be off center and depending on the zoom, sometimes cuts off your subject (only important if you like to capture what you're seeing)<br />-Not for beginners, must be prepared to tweak settings, does not have portrait, scenic, sport, etc., presets for speedy setup changes, -- Program, Aperture, Shutter, and Manual only.<br />Fix the viewfinder/lens difference and you've got a great camera!","5stars for the Olympus C-3040.This camera is very impressive. The price made me a little hesitant at first, but after several months of research I took a chance, and very glad I did. The C-3040 camera is packed with special features that took my photographs to a new level. I love the black and white /sepia mode at the touch of a button. And the Quicktime movie option is a awesome to be able to e-mail short video clips.<br />One thing I would recommend is to get a upgraded smartmedia card. The 16mb standard issue card only holds 20 shots at the medium quality HQ format (which is good) but if you go to the high quality TIF format you get 1 shot. Also be sure to get a genuine Olympus smartmedia card or else you NOT be able to use the panorama feature. Great Camera","I have had the 3040 for about 6 months now, and am very pleased.  I find it easy to use and it takes fantastic pictures.  I am not an experienced photographer, but am finding the size and versatility of this camera to be great.  I am glad I did not buy a point-and-shoot.  While the 3040 is as easy to use as a point-and-shoot, the ability to add lenses and external flash will allow it to grow with me.  My only complaint is that many of the features are buried in the 2nd and 3rd levels of a menu, making them less convenient to access.","When I use this camera, I tend to shut it off when I'm not using it for a few minutes to save battery life and cover up the lens. This exposes a few flaws in the interface:<br />- It's slow to start up from power-on to ready-to-shoot<br />- It can remember certain settings between power-downs, but it's cumbersome to set those values (white balance and speed in particular)<br />Also, it doesn't have a very wide range for exposure; the minimum aperture is f/10 and the maximum shutter speed is 1/800. That can be overwhelmed on a sunny day (and you lose depth of field).<br />Another annoyance is the chromatic aberrance; bright white objects often appear with a purple fringe around them.<br />That said, if you stick to the camera's strengths, it's decent. If you plan ahead for the right shooting situation, the settings don't get in the way. It's fun for shooting macro stuff too. The saturation and color fidelity is very nice.","This camera brought me back to photography, after many years away not being able to afford taking pictures the way I liked. With this you take as many pictures as you want, delete the ones that don't work, spend no extra money.  The camera has all the features of a fine camera, and produces excellent prints up to 8x10 or more with \"film\" camera quality.  Easy to download to a PC with the USB cable, burn onto a CDR, edit up to make even mediocre pictures look good.  Small and handy to carry around.<br />  I considered the 4 MP+ cameras, but I thought the extra price was steep for extra resolution I couldn't even see; plus the penalty of the extra storage space needed.  (When you get one of these cameras, be sure you have 20 to 30 GB for storage, or a supply of CD-R's.)<br />  Two shortcomings easily fixed:  get rechargeable batteries and a charger: the 2 CR-3V's are great but too expensive to replace.  Better to use the CR-3V's only while the others are recharging.  Also, the 16MB memory card is way too small: pick up at least 2 64 MB cards, maybe even 3, which allow you to do a 160 to 240 picture excursion between PC downloads.","I love this camera!  Started with the Olympus C700 with a 10x zoom and 2.1 megapixels.  Great zoom capability but very unsteady -- many blurred pics.  Returned the camera ..., and bought this C-3040.  The sharpness, color and ease of use are EXCEPTIONAL.  Learned quickly that best way for well focused & framed pictures is using the display view finder instead of the eyepiece viewfinder.  The eyepiece doesn't look \"through the lens\" like the C700 did, so your framing is always a bit off.  But through the display viewfinder it is perfect.  My pictures are rarely come out blurry.  The superbright lens isn't as fantastic as I expected -- indoor pics without a flash are still grainy and sometimes blurry.  But it does extremely well with a flash indoors.  Great at both distance & closeups.  Automatic mode works very well.  Has an easy to set \"custom\" setup so your resolution, flash, redeye, etc. can be preprogrammed to work each time you turn the camera on.  Lightweight.  Writes to disk quickly.  Easy to review & delete photos. Great camera for the casual amateur!","...I have been very happy with this camera.  It is simple to use, and the Olympus Camedia software is very good.  Users can begin snapping pictures immediately by just reading the quick start guide that comes in the package.  Software installation was easy, and I like the fact that it connects via USB and that my computer sees the camera as another storage device (I am on Windows 98).  Moving pictures from the camera to my hard drive is as easy as clicking and dragging or copying and pasting.<br />There are many advanced settings, like aperture, exposure, etc.  I don't understand any of those yet, so I haven't touched them.  The camera is smart enough to make the adjustments for me.  Give me some time, and I'll start monkeying with the more advanced settings.<br />I HAVE played with the resolution quality, and found it easy to change by navigating on the camera's menu.  I have also taken Black and White photos, color photos, and something called Sepia, which makes the photo look like an old fashioned picture you may have taken at Knott's Berry Farm or Disneyland.<br />One neat feature that I found was the ability of the camera to capture sound and video in QuickTime format.  I took a 30 second clip of video at the office just for fun.  I don't know how much I'll use this feature, since if I really wanted to do a decent \"family event\" video, I'd go out and buy a digital camcorder, but it was kind of neat and easy to do.<br />The only thing I didn't like was the battery compartment cover.  On a camera that has a very solid, almost German sedan-like feel to it, I was surprised that the cover seemed rather flimsy.  I sense that if I do not exersise care while closing the cover after inserting a new battery, that the cover may snap at the hinges.<br />My wife was able to use the camera after only the briefest of tutorials, so that in itself was worth the purchase price.  My son enjoys mugging for the camera, and he especially enjoys being able to look at the picture immediately after pressing the button.<br />I've read reviews that comment about the high price tag, but think about it.  It is an Olympus camera that looks great, takes great pictures, and is super simple to use.  It has advanced features for the expert photographer, but the menu is easy enough for novices.  ...","This camera is a first class piece of workmanship,with a couple of exceptions.<br />1) The lens cap is the biggest piece of S**T! The design engineer should be hung, it will cause you to destroy the camera out of frustration! It doesn't stay put. Buy four extra.<br />2) The tiny flash card should NOT be a purchasing point! A 128 MB card is a must<br />3)The battery's that come with the camera are useless, buy rechargeable ones. The camera should come with a charger and rechargeable battery's","Takes GREAT pictures, just like my D-490Z did/does.  I love the Olympus camera products, just beware of the gray market Olympus cameras that are out there.  Olympusamerica.com provides you with info. on this, and provides the legit product numbers/serial numbers they place on them.  My lens cap works fine, some say it does not fit right, but I have no problem.  My telescoping lens did not \"grind\" like others have described; it does emit a slight mechanical sound though. Also, pictures can be erased or lock protected immediately after taking them, if desired.  The video/sound combo option is sweet, only dark in picture when indoors with NORMAL lighting.  Video too can be viewed/deleted using the cameras LED screen immediately after filming.  Just a note on the sound/video portion. I was having problems with a skipping and jumpy video product when viewing it from a camera/card reader to computer connection.  Turns out the READ speed is too slow for this, the video clip must be transferred from the cameras Smartmedia card to a file folder on the computers hard drive first, then viewed from the file folder.  David B, via-Olympus' e-mail Tech Support solved the problem for me on the first try, I truly thank him. When I tried them, the phone Tech Support didn't ask the right questions, and I wasn't smart enough to provide the right additional info. The camera case Olympus makes for it is a little tight in the lens cap area, so a little larger after-market one might be a better fit.  Definitely get a 128MB Olympus Smartmedia card, it allows you to take so much more video/picture wise, and only the OLYMPUS SMARTMEDIA CARD has the panoramic capability, not the VIKING or others.  If you put a little time and effort into this camera to learn it's features and displays you will be greatly rewarded, but keep the book handy for quick referral. Finally, make sure you call the company you are purchasing it from first to make sure it's not GRAY MARKET, comes in the original box, and has all the manufacturers accessories (i.e. strap, lens cap, connection cables, CAMEDIA software, instruction manuals, etc).  Olympus does offer manuals online if you lose the original...I look forward to using this camera more in it's auto-mode, or if I desire, in it's full manual mode. You will appreciate the manual capability later if you are used to full automatic type cameras- your developing skills begin to crave it! For the price to options/capability, this is the camera. Enjoy, and I hope this review helps you to make a decision.","After 3 months of research, reading, studying, visiting camera shops, internet shopping, I found that this camera is the absolute best! I have no trouble with the menus - the instruction book is long, but written very clear and concise - if you need to do something, just look it up. I've sent mpegs over e-mail, and it's wonderful having a grandchild say \"I love you\" to his grandparents! The photographic quality is just as good as my old 35mm - even better! The choices for the pixel sizes are good, and not hard to program in. I love the remote! Once you get this camera - well, you won't need any other!","I haven't owned but a dozen or two cameras in my time, so I am not an expert. I did once go nuts with photography equipment, so at least I have an idea of what to expect from a camera.<br />The Olympus has been fun! Leaving it on the automatic mode at maximum resolution and JPG compression, it takes beautiful pictures, and over a hundred of them on one 128meg SmartMedia card. I definitely do recommend getting at least one extra 128meg card. (I want four more so I can fill a CD with each photo session.) The write speed to the memory card is pretty fast for even the highest resolution providing it's JPG compressed. Maximum TIF formats however do take some seconds, but at roughly 10 megs per photo (compared to less than 1 meg for JPG), the time delay is to be expected. If you're wanting really nice photos to view on your monitor and occasionally print-out, JPG is fine. For serious prints however the TIF is of course best.<br />Viewing the pictures on your monitor is simply wonderful (providing of course your monitor is nice too! ;) ). Even in very low light, using the flash will give you excellent colors and skin tones. I kind of hate to say it, but I'm starting to enjoy viewing photos on the monitor more than looking at developed photographs. (And I hated digital photos until now!)<br />The weight is pleasing, not heavy, but weighty enough to feel solid. The software is great for uploading onto a PC using an USB port. (It configures itself as an external drive, working just like a normal hard drive, very easy to access and copy files. Tons better than the other digital camera I own.)<br />I'm not thrilled about the mechanical zoom, it feels and sounds a little rough, but it does ok, so I can't complain (much). There are seemingly hundreds of little commands to learn (of which I've learned maybe 50 so far), but that's cool, it just means I'll be able to do more with the camera as I get more familiar with it. But it does come with hefty-sized manuals! I do think Olympus should include a case for it though, even a cheapy.<br />Oh! The QuickTime movie capability is a blast! You will want plenty of lighting for that though since the camera's built-in flash won't work during movie taking. QT quality is actually reasonably decent, plenty good for quicky web emails and CD home movies (mono though, not stereo).<br />Battery life is excellent! I have absolutely no idea how long a set of batteries will last since I lost track of the time used after a few hours. (Several hundred photos were taken and uploaded before the rechargable batteries finally got low.) I recommend a set of rechargable batteries along with a disposable set just to make sure. If you're like me you will begin thinking the batteries will last forever and then forget about needing replacements.<br />Over all I feel the camera is well worth the price. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it isn't as nice as the E-20 I'm drooling over (duh!). Everyone who has seen the photos taken by it are surprised of the quality. It's a good camera, of that there is no question.","Before purchase, I did some VERY extensive research, and I finally decided on the C-3040 over the Sony DSC-P5, mainly because of the ability to use other lenses, external flash capability and weight. The C-3040 is the perfect size and weight (too light, and it's hard to keep steady). It takes excellent photos, a little on the dark side for indoor shots, but nothing that can't be fixed with half-decent photo editing software. If you don't use the LCD all the time, the battery life is acceptable, but you should still make one of your first accessories a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and a charger (THE first should probably be a nice camera bag). Unless you're taking a large number of uncompressed photos, you can probably wait a while for a larger memory card. The included 16MB card takes about 20 pictures at the default resolution. Downloading to a PC takes about 30 seconds for all 20 shots, and you're ready for more. Still, a 64, or at least 32MB card would have been awfully nice and should probably be near the top of your list.<br />The flash, with adjustable brightness and delay time, the optical zoom capabilities (DON'T get a camera without optical zoom), the USB connection and the programability were the major deciding factors in my purchase decision.<br />There is, however, one drawback, but I don't think it's serious enough to merit a lower rating, and that's the fact that the image you see through the viewfinder is smaller than what will actually be recorded. You will have to compensate for this when you shoot. The best thing is to take a good number of test shots to get used to this effect before doing any serious shooting. The manual says using the LCD to compose your shot gives more accuracy, which is true, but there is still a difference between what you see and what gets recorded.<br />Overall, I'd highly recommend this camera to anyone, except maybe a serious hobbyist or a professional. Also, it might be a little pricey for beginners or digital first timers, but if you can swing it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />Final things: Experiment with the different modes (black & white, sepia, etc.) and functions, and if you want an external flash attachment, you don't have to pay hundreds (almost as much as the camera) for the one Olympus sells; you can get the flash attachment BRACKET for about thirty bucks, and use almost any flash that has the 5-pin connector.","This is my first digital, after a long time devotion to 35mm. I read many reviews and articles, then just went for it. Well, it was worth every penny. This camera takes great shots, especially outdoors. The 1.8 lens makes all the difference indoors as well, and any shot will come out great, since everything can be adjusted manually. I have found the adjustable flash power excellent for eliminating flash burn in darker settings. And night scenes in NYC without the flash worked great as well. So far I have not found any shortcomings with this camera, and teamed up with an HP 1215 printer, I'm makin' really nice photos. The only thing I can think of to complain about is the lack of explanation about the different shooting quality modes, and what situation you need to use what setting. Other that that, I have been very pleased with this camera.","I bought this camera in December 2001 as my first digital<br />camera after many years of using a Minolta 35mm.<br />I like not having to carry a heavy camera bag with an<br />assortment of lenses and rolls of film, etc.<br />I like being able to examine a photo immediately, and<br />erase it if necessary.<br />I like being to \"lock\" a picture I want to keep from<br />accidental erasure, and being able to add a voice comment.<br />I like the information about number of pictures for which<br />there is still room on the card, and time, etc.<br />I like being able to show the photos on the TV, full<br />screen, so that everyone in the room can see them.<br />I find the manual needs study - but so far I have not looked<br />for any information I couldn't find very quickly.<br />The only trouble I have had is that the lens cap falls off<br />very easily - but the lens strap cord prevents any major<br />trouble.<br />I can thorougly recommend the Olympus C-3040 as a first<br />digital camera.","Nice camera, good resolution; only comes with a 16 mb card which I promptly replaced with a 64 mb card: why pay for 3 megapixels then not use them?  I also have the Olympus E-10.  Huge difference in ease of use and in price.  The viewfinder on the 3040 is poor, on the E-10 super.  Zoom is greater on the E-10, which, I believe also has image stabilization.  The E-10 is a pro-level camera and weighs like one; the 3040 is a compact that barely weighs anything.  that's why i have both.  For serious photo excursions, I'll take both; for bopping around and the opportunistic photo I use the 3040.","I love this camera. Seems like each time I use it or review the owners manual I discover more stuff I can do with it. Recommend a 64mb card. Easy to use out of the box, the interface doesn't take that long to learn if you want to do more advanced photography. I strongly recommend this camera for novice and intermediate camera users.","This camera has a plethora of bells and whistles... I'm learning the  bells, I know some/most of the whistles.  Great digital output, more than enough for 10\"X14\" photos at high resolution!  Still experimenting with the unit as I am a bit more familiar with 35mm film format, this being my first digital adventure.  Shop around, lots of deals to be had.  Very light/compact with much potential for greatness, left only to whatever the users imagination can produce.  I feel the flash needs to be experimented with however.  The camera is not too difficult to handle/understand, but READ THE MANUAL... lots of neat well documented info available.  Invest in a Ni-MH batteries and charger if you plan to process a lot of pictures.  Also wise (for me) to acquire an AC adapter as well.  Nuf said....","My Olympus C-3040 was delivered on Aug 27, 2001 and I've taken more pictures with it in these 4 months than I did in the last 4 years with my SLR.  It's simply a fun camera to use, and I'm sure I haven't even used half the features, yet!  I won't list every great feature because the reviews that have been posted cover everything in detail, but I will relate some of my experiences:<br /> - buy a 128 MB SmartMedia card, but only the OLYMPUS card will allow automatic stitching of panoramic shots.  The included 16 MB Olympus card has this feature, but the Viking 128 MB card does not.<br /> - buy a charger with 4 batteries plus 4 extra batteries.  Keep in mind that most people like to use the display all the time, so batteries will run out quickly.  I only use the display to review the pictures taken, 99% of the time I use the viewfinder to take the picture.  Consequently, I get great life out of my batteries.<br /> - the automatic mode works for just about every situation.  The only problem I've had was taking pictures of a Christmas tree with lights, which seemed to confuse the focus and every picture came out blurry.  I had to read the manual and when I put it on manual focus the pictures came out sharp.<br /> - although a large-capacity SmartMedia card will NOT increase the length of the video clips (75 seconds is the max), it WILL allow you to store several 75-second movies.<br /> - I bought a USB card reader that does both Compact Flash and SmartMedia.  It works so well that I've gotten in the habit of taking pictures of just about everything.  For example, I bought a power tool that I wanted to tell my buddy about, so I just shot two quick pictures, downloaded them, an emailed them to him.  \"A picture IS worth a thousand words\".  Popping the memory card out of the camera and into the card reader is a snap, and it doesn't use any of the camera's battery.<br /> - the included Remote Control makes self-portraits a snap; no more hurrying to get in position before the red light blinks; and you can take several remote control pictures in a row if you like.","This camera is great. There are plenty of options for the novice photographer to the low intermediate photographer. The pictures come out clear, well focused and the camera responds well to a wide variety of light conditions. Whether taking pictures in a dimly lit theater without flash or at night or during dusk hours - the pictures come out very well. I would definitely buy this camera again. One or two little nits, 1) carry a set of extra batteries if you're going to take several pics at a time. There is only brief indication that the batteries are getting low and then - boom - the camera is out of juice. 2) there is a brief delay between hitting the shutter button and the picture being taken - but it is easy to get used to.","+Performance<br />This digital camera allows FULL control of picture capture - apeture size, speed (1/800th sec!), film speed, a white balance differential, manual zoom, and basically everything you have in an SLR and more.  The pictures are excellent on the auto setting for outdoor shots. Indoor shots are more difficult, but can be done well with some steady hands and setting customization.  Close up shots are limited to greater than 7-8 inches.  However, there is a macro option allowing the range finder to know you are focusing up close.  The flash can bleach out images, but I've been using the white balance to correct this easily. From a straight forward image quality and ease of picture taking, I cannot complain.<br />The LCD screen is fabulously clear.  The interface does take some time to understand, but is no more difficult than a computer monitor interface.  The read/write can lag if you really push it with semi-auto like shooting or using repeated multi shot.  The zoom is not bad, but has something to be desired with the tube extension making the proportions not quite a true point-shoot camera or an SLR.<br />+Bonus<br />There are some nifty and useful functions like a 3-spot light meter that gives you the average, a 360 panorama stitching function, 5-shot `autowinder,' and video recording capability. The tactile feel is excellent with a non-slip surface on the hnad-interaction areas.<br />+Connectivity<br />No card reader needed with the included USB patch cable.  Super simple and a very fast download time.  Using XP makes it even easier - don't even need the 3rd party software.<br />+Longevity<br />With a 128 MB card at 1600x1200 resolution (medium) I can burn through the card 1-2 times with downloads no problem, dependent on the flash and LCD use.  This is a lot of shooting on 4 AA NimH - from my past Kodak and Nikon dig cam experience.<br />Peeves include no immediate delete option when you've just taken a bad picture. And you can record audio to a picture, but can't playback on the unit until cpu download.  I could continue with the lame 16 MB card included and one-time use batteries, but the overall verdict is that Olympus made a very professional camera for people who want total control but the convenience of semi point-shoot size dimensions.  5 stars for rock-solid performance at a fair price.","I didn't think I'd enjoy the video capturing feature as much as I do - and don't fool yourself, having sound makes a BIG difference (c-3020 doesn't have sound).  People are not aware that it records video because it looks so much like a regular camera.  You can get some truly funny captures.<br />Having a strap for the lens cap is a simple but NICE addition, too.  The c-3000 doesn't have it and you're always losing the damn thing.<br />The f1.8 is great, too.  Every little bit helps in those low light situations.<br />The only thing I didn't like is that, though it has serial output (along with USB), the serial cable itself is considered optional and is not included.  Chincy (...)!!!<br />Buy a large memory card - you won't regret it.  At the highest resolution with a 128MB card, you can snap 163 photos.<br />Max record time on the high resolution is 75 seconds.<br />Navigation though the menus are intuitive and easy - the manual is only necessary for advanced features.<br />I have now seen and used the c-3000, c-3020, and c-3040.  The c-3040 is my pick!","This is my third Olympus digital camera. I also own the D460Z and D490Z. The C3040 overcomes the main shortcoming of these other cameras: speed. The C3040 is speedy two critical ways. First, it has an onboard memory buffer, so you can shoot many shots immediately after each other. Indeed, it features a \"rapid shoot\" and \"exposure bracket\" option to take 3 or 5 shots rapidly in about 1.5 seconds. This is a great option if you need the \"money shot\". I was at a friends wedding and wanted to provide a few unique candid photos. The 3040 did not disappoint. Second is the F1.8 lens... which means that low light shots are definitely possible. Last month I was on the Great Barrier Reef as turtles came up on shore to nest at night. The turtles are frightened off by light, so flash photography was out. With the speed of the lens, plus a near full moon and cloudless sky; I've got some grainy, but still incredible pictures.<br />Other great features: sound recording/annotation and built in USB connector (soooo much faster to download).<br />The C3040 is not perfect. Three issues... yes, the lens cap is a problem. No solution I know of. Second, the viewfinder is not WYSIWYG. The mismatching is significant... though at least the viewfinder errors on the side of showing you less than what is actually captured. Third, versus Olympus's digital point-and-shoots, the C3040's form factor is large, which sometime discourages me from carrying it.<br />So the search for the perfect digital goes on. I'm going to also pick up the C2100, which solves the WYSIWYG viewfinder issue.","I have always been a photography fan, but have always lacked knowledge.  When we got our first \"real\" computer, we also decided it was time to get a digital camera.  We got at the time what we felt was the \"top-of-the-line\" and we were not disappointed.  This camera is very easy, and delivers incredibly crisp, clear photos.  The zoom is a bit disappointing, aftermarket lenses are ok.  Frustrating to go from attached zoom to regular view...zoom lense needs to be detached or you have a circle in the picture...the lense does not really fit the camera...have yet to find Olympus zoom and/or wide angle lenses for this camera...would love to as I completely LOVE my camera!","Like many people have said, this camera has so many features, it's hard to figure out how to use all of them.  I've had my 3040 for several months, and I haven't gotten around to trying out half the features.  Overall, I have been pretty happy with it.  While it does eat batteries, most digital cameras do, and it's easily solved by picking up some rechargables.  My only complaint is I can *not* get the lens cap to stay on.  It's not much of a problem if you always keep it in a camera case, but sometimes I throw it in my purse and inevitably, the lens cap will come off while I'm putting it in because it does not attach securely at all.  A minor inconvenience mostly, but still happens often enough to become frustrating.","I have had this camera for a couple of months and have really come to lke working with it. I consider myself a serious amatuer photographer and have a range on Nikon cameras and a darkroom in my home.  This is my first digital camera and it had to do alot to make me happy given my background with film.<br />The camera is very easy to use and the menu system is quite straight forward.  For everyday pictures of friends and family the automatic program mode offers very good point and click shooting.  I do not hesitate to let others snap away with it.  On the flip side, if I want to take photos requiring more control of the cameras functions I've been able to do so without having to resort to the manual.  Exposure compensation, flash control (red eye reduction, synch, exposure comp), aperture and shutter priority modes are all very easy to manipulate through the menu and cursor.  There are still a few controls that I've not yet tested and that I think says much about the depth of functions given how much I've tried to push this camera.<br />The images are quite sharp and very esy to work with.  All of my computers run either Windows ME, 2000 or XP andthey all support plug and play USB so getting files from the camera to the computer has been very easy.  I've used this camera with at least a half dozen computers without any trouble.<br />I have a few complaints, but I think these are endemic to digital cameras and not limited to this model.  The camera uses batteries quickly.  I wish there were more and better lens accessories.  I would especially like to work with graduated nuetral density filters for landscape shots.  Memory cards are expensive.  If you buy this or any digital camera you should consider at least a couple 64 or 128 MB cards and rechargeable batteries.  Adding these will boost your purchase price by a few hundred dollars, but will make your shooting that much more enjoyable.  In standard mode this camera will take 80 pictures on one 64 MB card.  Given that you can delete bad shots instantly this is like having three or four roles of 36 exposures in one camera.<br />I would not hesitate to buy this camera again.  However, if you have some additional money to invest I would consider the Camdia 4040 which is basically a 4 megapixel version of this camera.","I have owned an Olympus 340 for two years and I've been very happy with it...but I felt like I needed to graduate to the next level.  The quality and features were not as good as I would have liked.  So, after MUCH research where the Olympus 3040 was frequently popping up, I bought it about a month ago.  My first set of photos, when I still hadn't learned how to use any of the features, printed beautifully!  Stick them in a frame and you'd have trouble telling them from a 35mm photo!  That is what I was looking for in a digital camera!  The only problem I might mention is just that I've been using it for a month and I still cannot figure out how to use much of it!  The menus are not very intuitive and I end up doing a lot of searching when I want to do basic things like change the default photo quality setting or use the timer!  I'm sure I'll learn it all soon, but I think they took a step backward on the \"user-friendliness\".  But, for the HUGE upgrade in quality, I wouldn't go back to my 340 for anything!","There really two perspectives here, one from someone who has owns/uses a high-end Nikon (2 1/2 *), and the other from a new digital camera user (4 1/2 *).  I point this out because mid-range digital cameras are NOT really going to placate all of the needs of the amateur photographer, but may be appropriate for your situation.  Caveat photographer.<br />The biggest adjustment I've had with the C-3040 is the slowness in taking pictures -- delays of 1  to 5 seconds (fresh batteries, not including the startup time for the lens to extend to the default setting) before the photo is actually grabbed.  While fine for still life, this is a problem for truly spontaneous photos, such as of one's kids.  Expect blurry pictures on anything that's moving at more than a walking pace.<br />A second criticism is the flash seems too bright and colors wash out.  You can compensate for this in Photoshop, but I don't really think you should have to.<br />On the positive side, uploading pictures is extremely easy: on my Win2000 machine, I just plug the camera in, and the camera's pictures appear as a removable device.  Just cut and paste to your local machine.<br />Resolution is very good and services like Ofoto can print up to 20x30\" prints from the default (2048x1536) image size.  (With a 128Mb memory card, you can get 162 pictures at this resolution.)<br />The menu system in the camera is fairly extensive and you can alter default behavior such as turning off the camera's beep, changing color mode, shutter speed, color balance, date, and resolution.  Another nice feature is you can enable verbose data display, which will show you what settings were used for each photo.<br />The movie feature is actually more fun than I thought it would be.  Pictures are jumpy and the audio is fair, but I enjoy having it as an option.  You can record up to 74 seconds in one swoop -- this is a limit of the camera's internal memory, not the memory card size used.","Although I'm hardly an expert photographer, I feel like one now with this camera.  I love just about everything about it.  First of all, it looks like a real camera, not one of those pieces of junk that pass for cameras these days.  It takes incredible pictures right out of the box.  I have the option set for the camera to ask me everytime I take a picture whether I want to keep it or not.  That way, I can quickly zap any bad pictures.  The LCD monitor is easy to see so you have instant feedback as to whether or not you want to retake the picture.  The manual was very well written -- I spent a good deal of time reading it.  Even thought the camera does many things, the menu function is very intuitive.  After a day or so, I was able to do pretty much anything, even use shutter priorty mode or aperature priority mode.  Although many software programs have color options, I love the fact that you can shoot in black and white, color or sepia tones.  Also, this camera has both a digital and an optical zoom -- beware of false claims by other cameras.  I did a great deal of research before buying this camera and I'm happy to say after a month of using it, I have not been disappointed at all.  Some suggestiosn for accessories:  buy a card reader!  You don't want to drain the battery by using the USB cable right from the camera.  They only cost around $35.  You'll want at least a 64 MB card!  The one it comes with is too small (for the price of this camera, I think Olympus should throw it in).  The battery it comes with was dead on arrival and since it is not recharchable, forget it.  Buy AA rechargable batteries (one charger, two sets of batteries) and switch them often.  The batteries lose charge fast when you use the monitor feature, so beware and carry spare batteries when you travel!  A great camera.","I wondered about a digital camera.  I wondered if it would have good quality pictures, if it would be easy to use, if I would like it, if it would be worth the money, if it would be convenient, . . . ?<br />Wonder no More!  This camera is the best.  When I take pictures on the SHQ setting the quality is beyond amazing.  This camera is a must have!  It is easy, fun, creative, convenient.  It is the best camera I have ever had.  I love it!  I just jused it at my daughters engagement party and the pictures are wonderful!  Combine this camera with Paint Shop Pro 7 for adding text and other fun stuff and your creative capabilities will be unlimited!","This camera has been a joy.  I've seen other reviews state that getting to items in the menu can be difficult, but if you spend some time reading the manual and actually using the features, finding the various settings is not that bad.  I keep learning new ways to use it and now carry it with me to work for those photo ops.  My two 35mm Nikons may end up gathering a lot of dust.  If I had to refine my review to three items, it would be:<br />1) good ergonomic design; fits the hand well and finally fixes that bad lens cover problem<br />2) exellent features (burst, MOV, manual adjustments, etc.)<br />3) accepts rechargable AA batteries<br />I waited 3 years for cameras to get their resolution/features up and prices down.  It was a toss up beteen this one and the new C-700 (love the optics), but I'm glad I waited.","I think this is a product whit more details and I found this<br />is a spezial price for all photografy.","I think this is a product whit more details and I found this<br />is a spezial price for all photografy.","This camera is wicked.  Only way to get anything better is to go get a pro camera !  This is good for me - full manual, full auto or anywhere in between.  In airplanes you need to cotrol the F-Stop manually.  No prob - just go to a/s/m mode on the dial and press up/down to change f-stop and left/right to change target light level and shutter speed is adjusted autmoatically.  And the lens does collect light like no other.  1/40-1/80 shutter at nighttime stadium at ISO100 and 1/200 shuutter at ISO400.<br />Cool thing with the digital zoom.  Bump down your resolution to 1024x768 and use up to 2x of digital zoom with no quality loss (a 2048x1536 picture is taken and them middle 1024x768 is kept).  max Digital zoom is at advertised 2.5x at 2048x1536, 5x at 1024x768, and 7.5x at 640x480 (Multiply by the 3x Optical zoom!  -- 22.5x total zooming power if you don't mind quality loss from full digizoom and shooting at 640x480 (I use 1024x768 at the games for 3xO/5xD/15Xtotal.).","this camera takes excellent pictures, even under extreme lighting conditions, like complete darkness and with the bright sun in the background. i was impressed. note that when you look thru the viewfinder, your nose will touch the lcd and make the screen dirty. also in win2k, when i hook it up via usb cable i get bluescreen crashes! win2k USUALLY is stable compared to win9x/me. i hooked this thing up to my winME computer and it worked flawlessly. another point: the control to zoom in and out is right by the shutter release button and you have to use you right index finger to zoom. this is not good because you have to take your finger off the shutter release button, which is just wrong! they should have designed it so you could zoom with your thumb while your index finger stayed on the shutter button. make sure you get rechargable batteries and some smartmedia with this baby. i picked this camera up for under $....","If your going \"Digital\" and want a \"GREAT\" camera, the 3040 is it. Everything worked \"RIGHT-OUT-OF-THE-BOX\". The pictures this camera takes are \"FABULOUS\". With the auto settings on this camera you \"CAN NOT\" take a bad picture. All I can say is forget all the Product Descriptions and Technical Specifications - just buy this camera and have fun.","The pictures from this camera are truly wonderful. The image quality and color realism really come very close to what you'd expect from a reasonably good 35mm.<br />The only catch (as with all similar cameras) is to remember that if you take pictures at high-res, they are HUGE. I've seen single images that were 8mb - so a 128mb aftermarket card might hold only 15 or so pictures.<br />As with other high-pixel cameras, even lower-res pictures with this one are going to look better than they would from an entry level camera, mostly because of the better CCD and unusually good lens.<br />I don't have the bucks to purchase this one myself, but my company has one, and I love to use it.<br />My gripes:<br />No rechargable battery.<br />Lens doesn't \"go flat\" like it does on some cameras (but would be impossible with any high-quality lens).","The pictures taken on SHQ mode were exceptional for $... less than the other black camera on the market. I would suggest getting the 128MEG Smart memory card, rechargable batteries,camera bag and the AC adapter as taking pictures at this resolution you get only about 60 shots of high quality pictures. I printed a sample shot of my daughter on my Epson 740 printer, using plain photocopy ( Xerox ) paper at 720dpi and was amazed with the clarity and color of the picture. One big problem was getting my computer to recognize the USB port and the camera, a tougher task than I had anticipated, thinking that all the necessary info was on the installation software.  I had been trying to download my pictures to the computer but it would not link up. Olympus America has a website that helped me out of my jam thank-you Olympus America!!!","On a scale of 1-5, this camera is an 8. It just doesn't get any better!!!!!!!!!! I've been into photography for 20 years and this camera take pictures so sharp and clear that you would swear it was taken with the finest lens available. Viewing the images on my Sony Monitor is truly a pleasure. It is so simple to use both in manual and auto modes. Its got a great feel. I have large hands and its not so small that you feel like your going to drop it. Money was not necessarily the issue for me, but I can tell you that I spent about 10 hours or more researching every model. I did price comparisons on the web, retail stores etc. I don't think you can get more bang for your buck. Transfering images to a CD Rom is so easy. It took me less than 5 minutes to open the package, plug in the USB cord and create the CD. The MPEG movie feature is great also. I really cannot believe how great this camera is. I know the new 4.0 and higher pixel camera's are coming out. Good for you because this should make the price of this model drop. I can't imagine needing more definition and color saturation. If modeling agencies can use 3.3 and 3.4 pixel cams for their photo's, trust me, it will be good enough for whatever your doing. I agree with everyone else though on the memory, pick up a additional media card because you do run out of room pretty quick. You can buy a 128K for $... or less. WFO","This camera is awsome!! I use it to film sgort video clips with my friends and then I just add the sounds I want on my computer. In one we used Hotwheels cars and made it look real and we even made one blow up. Too bad I cant post the picture of that car exploding. P.S: We used a bunch of snap dragons to blow it up.","I have had several digital cameras over the last few years and the latest refinement of the 3000 series helps improve on the minor flaws in the last edition of this great camera. Besides being able to shoot great 8 x 10 scenics or watch pictures on my T.V. through my Camera with excellent quality, the new faster lens makes more low light flashless photography possible and the ability to upload pictures to the camera along with downloading in the previous version. The minor changes are significant enough for me so I can fix my pictures in my computer and watch them on my TV screen through my camera. There are so many great features on this camera including the remote control, multiple metering systems, multiple flash settings and remote flash capability, burst mode for multiple photos at high spead when needed, and even that movie mode for getting those birthday cake shots. Great value for a serious amateur photographer.","I've lusted after a digital camera of my own for over 5 years now, but only recently made the leap to get one. A great deal of comparison shopping (and some time spent with a friend's Kodak which I found close to useless) lead me first to the C3030, then to the C3040 when it was released. First off, the enhancements to the C3040 make it definitely worth getting, if only for its storage-class USB interface. This means that you can plug it into a Mac, or a PC running Win 2000, Me or XP and access the pictures WITHOUT installing drivers. I can't say enough about how wonderful that is, especially given the flakey nature of some drivers I've encountered. Next up, the big negative: No built-in battery recharger. This, I don't like. It's too easy to drain the batteries accidentally with this camera. Definitely buy the AC adapter for it and use it any time you plug the camera into your computer. My experience is that this is when you're at the greatest risk of draining your batteries. It's also not a bad idea to get a set of rechargeable batteries. The video mode is nice, but be aware that a bigger memory card will not necessarily allow longer movies to be recorded. It seems that when you record a movie, it stores the video in its internal memory, then copies that to the memory card. I've gotten video of 30-60 seconds at a time, and that seems to be the limit. Another note on the video format: The QuickTime format that's recorded is not widely recognized. The Apple QuickTime player will play it, but other QT \"compatible\" apps generally don't. If you want to convert it to MPG, AVI or RM, you'll need to use either the full QuickTime app ([amt.] from apple). I've heard about, but not tried, a freeware app from abc.com which will also read these files. One would hope that future releases of this camera will include the full QT on the CD. One last warning: I found cheaper prices for this on the internet from an assortment of camera stores, but without fail, all those stores would only sell the camera at those lower prices if you bought an overpriced accessory pack along with it. Otherwise, they tended to claim that they were out of stock (in one case, I was told that the camera was discontinued (2 months after introduction!) and that I should get the C4040 instead). Amazon's recent price drop brings them in line with the few camera stores I found with allegedly good reputations, and I know I can trust amazon to deliver what's promised.","I like almost everything about the C-3040. It is indeed, user friendly, very well thought-out.unlike the Nikon coolpix 995, which i also own. with the Olympus, i can make onboard computer changes quite fast.but.......with the type of photography i do, the camera fails.the problems that the C-3040 and other digital cameras have , that should come to an end quite soon, i hope, are; 1)slow computer speed after a shot has been taken.and 2)have to use a lower quality picture mode to stop action, under low light conditions. (like SQ1) you will get grain . what's the sense of having a 3 or 4 meg camera when you can only get that quality under ideal shooting conditions?","I have had this camera for several months now, and I am extremely happy with it. I find that this camera is easier to use than I expected (but that is not the same as simple). Don't lose the manual! Nevertheless, most of what you need to do often (resolution, macro, etc) are easy to remember. A negative is that the display can be difficult in bright light. Plusses are excellent optics, fine color and edge rendering, light weight, and availability of storage media at a reasonable price. The USB connection makes it very easy to move my photos from the camera to a PC (and relatively fast). This is a high quality camera in every way.","I upgraded from another Olympus, and found this one to be great fun in taking pictures, accepted an up-grade Smart Media card, and does what I expected.....except for one thing.<br />The USB connection between the software and the camera didn't!  On three different computers running current editions of Windows 98, the computer couldn't find the camera.  A card-reader solved the problem, and, on balance, offers improved speed.  I was just surprised that the included software didn't read the camera.<br />Otherwise?  superb","When I went shopping for a new digital Camera, I had several things on my wish list. One of the most important was that when I clicked the shutter, I wanted the picture taken THEN, not in 1/2 Seconds. Not in 1/4 Seconds. But THEN, before the subject moved. This camera has met my needs. I line up the shot, press the shutter 1/2 way down and the camera gets ready to take the picture. When the time comes, I press the button all the way down and I have My shot.<br />I also wanted to be able to enlarge my picures to 8x10 and have them look good. They do.<br />My object here was to get something to replace my 35MM SLR camera for vacation and family party shots. Since I normaly take about 10 Rolls of film at a family event, I feel that the camera will pay for itself after about 10 events<br />It does eat batteries for Breakfast, lunch and dinner so I recommend 2 sets of rechargeables.<br />With a 64 Meg Card it will take 81 HQ (2048x1536) Jpeg Shots, or 26 SHQ (2048x1536) Jpegs with less compression, or 6 (2048x1536) Tiff shots with no compression.  In my tests, I could find no aparent difference in the quality between these options. Since they are the same pixle size and since 8x10 is my target size, I shoot with the default HQ setting.  You can get more than 300 shots at a lower resolution, But I only tested the HQ and above.<br />Did I mention the IR remote control? or the optional bounce flash?","I bought this two weeks back and have tested this in varity of different situations - the results are just amazing. Time to kiss the big bulky SLRs - GOODBYE!","I've been using digitals since they were invented, mostly Kodak because they had the most accurate color and all those things that make good pictures, a friend showed me their C3030 I was impressed and I read a review on the improvements made in C3040, the review didn't say enough good things about the camera, this is an incredible camera, it can be used by an amature to make incredible photos and has all the features the pros could ever use.  ....I'll be using this camera till it wears out, it can't get better than this.  It takes better pictures than my Minolta 7000 xi 35mm camera!  Hope this helps you make a decision!","I am definetly not in the expert catagory, for photography and probably shouldn't have move up to this camera, from the easier to use, kodaks so soon,especially three days before my family reuion.  I can comprehend pretty well, so by the time I studied the manual, and figured out what I needed, to get good quality shots, the family reunion was over.  My first lesson was to go out and purchase the inexpensive, card transfer device.  After I downloaded my pictures I discovered that they were to dark, and software adjustments made them look poor.  I figured that I might need and external flash attachment, to avoid fumbling through the controls,at busy times, and that an additional zoom lens wouldn't hurt. My zoom pictures really suffered for light even though I used the enternal flash. I can use some additional tutoring. I Welcome!","I agree wholeheartedly with the many others on this site who have already told you about the excellent image quality this camera can produce. It's truly exceptional! Even on its default image-quality setting of \"HQ\" (medium), image quality is superb.<br />I'm not a digital camera expert, although I've been using a Canon A-1 35mm SLR for 22 years. I've spent almost a year researching my digital camera alternatives - I should have switched earlier! The end results I got from the 3040 using its out-of-the-box \"point-and-shoot\" settings are substantially better than what I've generally been able to previously achieve in my years with a Canon A-1. Compared to several other digital cameras I've tried, I find the TV output from the 3040 is superior - very high quality. Note: some reviews I've seen say this camera supports both PAL as well as NTSC TV outputs. Olympus tech support web site says no: it's one or the other but not both. USA models only support NTSC - European models only support PAL.<br />I found the camera easy to use and set up for the first time. The documentation is adequate and accurate but could use some help in the readability department. The supplied Camedia software is very ordinary, there are much better software products available at very low cost. USB connectivity to Windows Millenium worked great, dragging and dropping picture files couldn't be easier, although other software packages have a nice \"Transfer all pictures from the camera to a specific folder\" function that isn't available with the supplied Camedia software. If you connect the 3040 to your computer using USB, read the manual for the Camedia software carefully! The apparently obvious \"My camera\" icon on the Camedia PC screen is in fact non-functioning when USB-connected. The QuickTime movie function of the 3040 works well and is adequate for casual use but it won't replace your camcorder anytime real soon.<br />To get the best use out of your camera, expect to purchase several accessories not provided in the box:  1. The provided 16MB SmartMedia is pitifully small - replace it with a 64MB or larger. I use a 128MB Olympus card (the *only* SmartMedia card that currently supports Olympus' panorama feature).  2. Buy an AC adapter to minimize use of the rapidly-consumed batteries - especially when uploading photo's to the PC or displaying photo's on the TV.  3. Buy two sets (that's eight altogether) of rechargeable lithium ion batteries - and a charger, if you don't already have one. Taking a lot of pictures - especially with flash, uploading pictures to your PC or showing photo's on your TV consumes batteries very quickly! The batteries provided in the box are not rechargeable!  4. Buy a protective case to carry your camera, spare batteries, and spare SmartMedia card.<br />I marked this camera down to four stars solely because of its price. I think Olympus needs to include several, or all of the items I found myself buying as \"accessories\" above. Having said that, don't be afraid to shell out the money for this camera - you won't be disappointed with the end results. At the end of the day, that's what really matters isn't it? This camera takes really, really great pictures - no if's, and's, or but's. Enjoy!","After loving my Olympus C-2020 for the past two years I decided to give it to a relative and step up to a 3.34 Mega pixel CCD and faster lens.<br />I already knew that I liked the camera since the controls and interface are very similar to my old camera - Olympus has been smart enough to make small improvements to a great design.  The battery life is as great as ever too (mine lasted for 2 weeks of heavy daily use).  I still have the original set of rechargeable batteries that came with my C-2020 and they are still going strong many charges later.<br />I have been keeping my old SLR around for taking the \"serious\" shots with but I think those days are over.  I did some test shots on a vase with a multi-colored design in varying light conditions (with no flash and uncompressed).  I printed the digital shots on my HP-952C and compared them to the 35mm shots when they came back from the lab.  I couldn't believe it.  In all but the lowest lighting conditions the digital shots were better.  I had the best 35mm shot enlarged to 8x11 and printed out the best digital shot on 8x11.  I really expected the digital shot to be a little grainy but I couldn't see any distortion.  It was easily the equal of my SLR!<br />Good bye film, digital has finally crossed over the line.  I am never going back.<br />A few tips:  Spring for an extra set of batteries so you can swap them out.  Buy a 128MB or 64MB Smart Media card and spend a few extra bucks on a name brand so you don't get stuck with a dud.  Buy a telephoto lens to give that 3x lens a little help.","If I could edit my previous reviews, I would delete the concern about the 128Mb smart media card.  For now I will just say that the Viking card works like a charm.  There's just something wrong with the card that I bought, with respect to Olympus camera.  Since I can't even determine the brand of the card I bought, I can't warn anyone away from it.","I started with a Olympus 400Z I think. 1280x960 still printed great 8.5x11 on my photosmart. Now I've got 3.3 mega pixels, and I can't wait to print one of those at that size.<br />---------------------------------<br />Things I love:<br />Quality of photos<br />3.1 high resolution photos/second, to capture the action. I took some pictures of my daughter whipping a bubble wand around in a circle. With a regular 35mm camera I would have wasted 10 shots using the same approach. I got some spectacular action shots which you can see at ..., userid=jpayne.<br />Takes great indoor pictures. No problems with red-eye, and I am pretty sure I haven't even been using red-eye reduction. The Nikon Coolpix cannot be used for indoor pictures, if you believe the reviews.<br />QuickTime movies are a great way to share an experience with loved ones. I use the 320x240 (I think) resolution with sound. 75 seconds of that produces about a 24Mb .MOV file, which QuickTime 4+ can read and play back. In order to share that with my family on the east coast, I had to fork our $29 to apple to get the quicktime pro, which allowed me to compress that movie. That quality goes down, but I was able to produce a decent movie with a size of 1Mb instead of the original 15Mb (this was a 45 second movie). Awesome.  The fact that sound is part of the movie is critical. The Nikon Coolpix 990 doesn't have sound with its movies.<br />I copy the images to my laptop with a PCMCIA card. I just plop the smartmedia card into the PCMCIA card that's already inserted, and the \"Removeable Disk\" appears in Windows Explorer, and I can copy megabytes of data/second onto my hard drive. Don't waste your time with the FlashPath floppy adapter.<br />I manage my images with ThumbsPlus by cerious software (...). For $75, this is a dream come true for photo management software. In addition to all the image manipulations you could ever want, it also allows you to (a) apply a similar operation to a whole set of images at once, (b) associate keywords with each image, (c) allows you to associate user-defined fields to each image. The result of which, you can perform queries of the form: \"Find all imagines with Mom, Dad and Madeline, in Hawaii, out doors, in 1999\". Up pops a slice of your image database in seconds. Sure beats combing through photo albums (that I never get around to putting together anyway!)<br />I like the panoramic mode very much.  The software does a good job of stitching the images together for you.  You need the olympus card, though - the feature is disabled without that card.<br />The camera is nice and small.<br />---------------------------------<br />Things I don't like:<br />The lens cap doesn't automatically come off, so you MUST remember to remove it before you turn the camera on, or else you will hear a grinding noise as the camera lens tries to extend. I am already over this.<br />You cannot zoom when you make QuickTime movies if you are recording sound.  When you try to zoom, it does a digital zoom instead of an optical zoom.  Why bother?<br />The speed at which the camera copies images and movies to and from the smartmedia is less than inspiring. SO you will take a QuickTime movie for 75 seconds, and then wait another 45 seconds while the movies is copied to the smart media. Then when you want to play it you will wait another 45 seconds while it's copied back into the 32Mb internal buffer. I usually just play the movie back on my laptop, which can copy to/from the smartmedia in seconds (actually, it just plays the movie directly off the smart media card).<br />Previously I had mentioned I had trouble with 128Mb smart media cards, but it turned out to be the card.  I wasn't able to determine the brand of that card, otherwise I would warn y'all about it<br />---------------------------------<br />You can go to ... and look for albums from userid=jpayne to see some of the photos I have taken with the camera.  The pictures are all taken in the highest resolution, and most of them are taken at highest quality as well.","Normally, I am one of those poor souls who has to be first on the block when it comes to consumer electronics, but I held off buying a digital camera because I was unwilling to sacrifice image quality for digital convenience.  After witnessing the near 35mm quality of the new generation of 3.3 megapixel models, I decided the time had come.  Of course, much research had to be done, but I came to my choice of the C-3040 fairly quickly after triangulating information from photography magazines, Amazonians and online photo sites.  The superfast lens cemented the deal, as I prefer to shoot sans flash whenever possible.<br />Getting started with the C-3040 was fairly straightforward and within a couple of hours I had taken 20 or so photos and uploaded the good ones to Ofoto.  When the 5x7's I ordered arrived in the mail a few days later, my jaw nearly hit the floor.  The quality of the image and trueness of the colors are just amazing.  I hate to admit it, but the images have more clarity and detail than those shot with my Nikon N2000 SLR!  Also, I hadn't fully appreciated the convenience factor of using a digital camera in conjunction with an online photo service.  I'm a touch sad to say it, but my 35mm days may be behind me.","The camera is fantastic.  Takes great indoor pictures with no red-eye problems.  It takes great action shots with the 3 shots/second (at high resolution).  Amazing!<br />Just three weeks into it, my 128Mb smart media card stopped working, however.  I cannot get the camera to use that card, even though my laptop can read/write/format it just fine with my pcmcia card adapter.  So, I am disappointed with that, but thrilled with the camera in all other respects.","I'd been waiting for affordable digital cameras to get good enough to give me better pictures than my scanned 35mm negatives. Obviously I've waited long enough because this camera more than meets the test. There is a learning curve if this is your first digital camera--I recommend reading the manual--but the full complement of modes has not limited anything I've wanted to do. The macro focusing distance is close enough for normal flower shots--roses, lilies--and the camera fits my slow, cautious shooting style very well. I find the monitor easy to focus with, even with my post-middle-aged eyes. I can even use my reading glasses if I have too. The telephoto is long enough to be useful; shots from plane windows came out well. The f1.8 lens is great for indoor photography. If you're tired of futzing with film processing, dust&scratch cleanup, negative and proof storage, it's time to go digital! If you want to see your shots as soon as you take them, go digital! On my iMac, all I have to do is connect it, turn it on, and it looks like a drive. Copying 35 shots takes about two minutes. Get the rechargeable battery kit, have AA's for backup. With a 128MB card I get 55 shots at max resolution in the SHQ jpeg mode, and no file so far has been bigger than 2.1MB. Wow. Now all I need is a great photo-vacation!","I had been using the Olympus D-460 Zoom the past six months and was very pleased by the quality and ease-of-use provided by the camera.<br />It was time to upgrade, so I picked up the 3040 and was immeadiately impressed.  The picture quality is absolutely stunning, and the huge array of options and features are great.<br />If you're looking for a high-quality, reasonably priced 3 megapixel camera, this is the one.","This is an awesome camera!  It is light weight, easy to use, and takes fantastic pictures.  It is very user friendly and you don't have to be a genius to use it.  I highly recommend it!","Nothing is perfect, so no 5 stars. I waited to buy a digital camera because of cost and perceived low quality. Well, they are still expensive, but boy was I wrong about quality. The quality of this blows away my Minolta 35mm. I still prefer the control of an SLR camera, such as the perfect timing of a shot, zoom, etc... I just wouldn't pay 3-5k for a digital SLR. So I bought the c3040 and I will use it until the price for a digital SLR comes down to earth. The picture quality is absolutely amazing! The only problem I have had is with a viking 64mb card. The camera couldn't format it. Other than that, I love it. I highly recommend it for those who want quality pictures and don't need all the control that and SLR offers.","This camera is great right out of the box.  The lithium batteries that came with it worked fine, but buy the rechargeables.  I used this camera at my wedding and the pics were almost as good as the professional photograpers.  The only difference is that he used filters on his 35 mm and all that was used on this 3040 was the default settings.  However, when printed on the Epson 870 with good Epson paper.  You can barely tell any difference.  And if you touch the digital photos up with some editing software, they are much better than the professional's photos.<br />If you are in the market, buy this camera. I love it and have never changed any of the settings or added any periphals other than a larger memory card.  By the way, the great wedding pics did not even use the highest resolutions setting and were still great.  I REALLY LOVE THIS CAMERA.<br />I use the USB cable plugged directly into the camera and it is very fast.  The QuickTime movie feature is great too for uploading clips to our website.","I had the C3030, but sold that and bought this because of the f1.8 lens on it (vice 2.8 on the 3030) which makes an already outstanding camera even better. This camera outstrips the performance of my 35 mm SLR, and after much research, I concluded it outperforms most digital cameras as well.<br />When it comes right down to it, picture quality is what makes or breaks a digital camera. The C3040 sweeps the field. Color quality and sharpness exceeds my 35 mm. I took a face portrait of my son and blew it up to just his eyeball - you could count the tiny veins in his eye. You can easily blow up pictures beyond 8 x 10 and still have sharp pictures. It does a better job reproducing sharp, realistic colors than most Kodak film. I show the pictures to professional photographers using ten-thousand dollar cameras and they are all surprised at how close the performance comes to theirs.<br />Low light capability is very good with the C3040.  The menu is easily navigated (although it will take a little study of the manual; the camera has a lot of capability) and the controls are, for the most part, very easy to use. The camera is nicely programmable for those who want to venture there. The memory-buffered multi-picture capability (like a fast motor drive in an SLR) is very handy for action shots. The camera is extremely compact considering its capability and can be carried easily. When taking pictures, it is very comfortable and natural to hold, unlike many other digital cameras.<br /> The 3040 improved its interface capability since the 3030 model.  You no longer need software loaded on a computer - plug in the USB cable and the camera is recognized as another hard drive for dragging and dropping files (or you can use the included software).  I took it a step further and bought an inexpensive Smart Media PC card adaptor. I pop the card out of the camera and into the PC slot and it is a near instant download of 128 MB of pictures! (I purchased the 128 MB card and it holds a huge number of pictures).<br /> It uses up batteries, but no more than other digital cameras. I purchased 1400mah NiMH batteries and travel charger...it works great and lasts a reasonable amount of time; hasn't been a problem.<br /> I have taken many hundreds of pictures, perhaps thousands, without a glitch. One of my few complaints is the flash performance, but the camera takes such great pictures without the flash, especially with a tripod, I mostly don't use it.<br />Olympus has come out with a new model already to one-up this one.  I believe it's the C-4040, at 4.2 megapixel or something.  I'm sure that's a great camera too, but you don't need it unless you routinely blow up your pictures to greater than 8 x 10.<br /> Bottom line is you will love this camera.","I used to be a serious camera buff. Loads of Nikon gear, etc. My first shot at digital was the Olympus D600L, a nice TTL digital. Not really comperable to a film camera, but good enough for small time digital only work - still used a couple of film cameras for 'serious' stuff. Just got the C-3040 after looking at its specs and reviews of the C-3030 here on Amazon. Amazon did not have the 3040 yet, so bought elsewhere (NY camera store).  The 3040 meets or exceeds all expectations. It is a REAL camera. Compact, light, easy to use for point & shoot yet with almost all the 'serious' capabilties. No wait between shots, low light capable with f1.8 lens and ISO 400 ability. See the reveiws for the C-3030, kick in the added speed, and you know what I mean! Plus the little things - lens cap tied to the camera, ability to use the LCD for framing, index at the back of the manual, easy to understand manual (but too much to remember because of the many, many functions available). Although you need to go through menus for some stuff, most of the commonly needed functions are either on the dial or telephoto control. Can't say enough good about this puppy - it looks like our film cameras are going into early retirement. May seem pricey, but easily worth every cent.","I am waiting for this camera to be available...anybody have a date?????????<br />Thanx"]},{"name":"Kodak DC3200","amazon_reviews":["Kodak DC3200 1MP Digital Camera<br /><br />This was the first really popular Kodak digital camera that was released just in time for Christmas 2000, and it was discounted to $100.<br /><br />It's difficult to compare this early Kodak digital to today's digital cameras. In the year 2000, the camera was replacing cheap point and shoot 35mm film cameras and 110 Kodak cameras in the target audience.  You could upload your photos to the World Wide Web on a modem, and share them online.  Kodak made home printers so that the consumer could print out the photos.  It was a huge hit, and probably more than any one camera, started the digital camera revolution.<br /><br />Mine still works, and I still occasionally use it.  But look at these 16 year old photos, of what it did back in 2001.","my mom has this camera.. for the price i guess its ok but a new updated camera i would recomend..<br /><br />i would sugest look at other cameras before you deside this one<br /><br />pros:<br /><br />a very simple camera<br /><br />not hard to use<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />no special features like b&w or vivid or timer or anything<br /><br />some pictures come out blurry.. dont take pictures too close up.. flash is not good for close-ups.. takes 4 batterys.. not a slim camera<br /><br />overall its ok if you dont want to spend lots of money and looking for just a very simple camera easy to use and dont want any fancy features you wont use","We bought this camera from a relative who wasn't ready for the digital age (even though it's extremely simple to use).  We've had it for 4 years now and it has never failed us yet!  We use it for every function and with our outdoors lifestyle and 2 active little girls, it's been dropped repeatedly with no problems in function--it's tough!  The only problem I have with it is the aforementioned battery door problem (which was already broken when we received it) but a thick rubberband has worked wonders and we have no problems with it draining batteries as long as our 3-year old doesn't pull the rubber band off!  This is a great camera for a first-time digital camera user and with the Compact Flash card, it holds an amazing amount of photos!  We do print ours out and they are just as clear (if not clearer) than a regular 35mm film camera when the digital is set to 'best' so it's really a bargain! This is a great camera folks, we highly recommend it!","one of my friends saw this cam for cheap 3 years ago so me and another of our buddies went out and bought the cam. it was our first digi cam and for what it is its great. nothing fancy here, just a simple point and shoot digi cam which produces some pretty good pics. i have took it anywhere and everywhere i have gone, and have always been happy with the pics, a few weeks back i updated to a Panasonic FZ-20, so this Kodak will live its life out in my glove box, never know when a cam will come in handy and this one is great. its rugged and tough so it will with stand the glove box tumbles.<br /><br />please remember that this camera i bought 3 years ago and in todays world its not worth the price of 150 though if you find it for 50 or less then by all means buy it.","This was my first digital camera.  It was given to me as a Christmas gift two years ago and it's still working to this day.  However, the door that holds the batteries in broke long ago so I have rubber bands tied around it to keep the batteries in place.  My Mom has the same camera bought at the same time mine was (she bought both of them together) and guess what?  Her battery door is broken too!  My second complaint is the lag time between when you actually press the button and when the actual image is recorded.  This is problematic when taking pictures of my toddler who is always in motion.  My third and final complaint is the flash, but I see that's already been discussed here so I won't dwell on it; let's just say put your sunglasses on because it will blind you!<br /><br />But I have taken literally thousands of pictures with this camera and as I said, after two years of steady use, it still works.  It's easy to operate.  It's affordable.  The quality of the pictures is good for emailing purposes (I rarely print them out).  I recently upgraded to the Canon Powershot A75, but I'll keep my Kodak around for a backup.  If you're on a tight budget and can't spring for anything pricey, or if you just want a really basic digital camera, you should be pleased with this one.","I bought this camera when it first came out in a package deal that also included a photo printer. I have hardly used the printer as it took to long to print and was difficult to navigate. I have loved the camera, though, until the tragic day that I accidentally dropped it the the battery door broke. We've tried, unsucessfully to keep it closed using all kinds of extra strong taping products, but it only holds long enough to take one picture and sometimes not even that long. It is way past its warranty and I knew it was being discontinued. I have just today purchased a newer camera with more up-to-date functions, but this one has been very good to me. It will be missed.","I've had this camera roughly 3 years (I got it when it first came out, which has been a while), and after all this time it still impresses me.  Whenever I first bought it, I used it maybe once or twice and (being the trendy person I am) ended up feeling embarrassed for carrying around such a clunky and awkward camera-- so i stashed it away for a couple years. But when I pulled it out and dusted it off a few months ago...something strange happened:  I fell in love with it and suddenly remembered all the reasons I bought it on that one infamous day a few years ago.  Forget the fact that the flash is a little bright at times.  Forget the fact that it has a fixed lens and a useless 2x digital zoom.  Those things are irrelevant.  What you need to know when thinking about buying this camera (new or used) is this:  It works.  It's easy.  It's endearing.  It no longer looks outdated-- I like to think of it as 'having a retro look to it.'  Even on the lowest quality picture setting, I'm still able to make good 4x6 prints, and when I use the 'Best' setting-- the 4x6 prints are flawless and you can even make 5x7's that look like they came from a quality 35mm film camera.  I recently got a 256mb CompactFlash card on sale-- and you can store almost 800 pictures at the highest pixel setting, or nearly 2,500 on the low setting.  A lifetime supply of film.  Long story short:  this camera has stood the test of time and it's even better now than it was when I first bought it.  Kind of like a fine wine, I suppose.  If you're looking for a cheap and easy camera and something that you can rely on for reliablity-- get this camera.  For it's age and it's price:  it's second to none.","While it is by no means the most feature rich digital camera available, it is a fine point-and-click camera that will get you good quality photos without busting the bank.<br />It has its pluses and its minuses like anything else, but it still remains a fine digital camera especially for first time buyers. It is pretty inexpensive but you don't really loose quality for a lower price. Its main shortcomings are that it has a flash that could be seen from the moon. It is way too bright for taking pictures up close in a dark situation. However, the flash can be diffused somewhat by securing a piece of tissue over the flash. Since it is a budget model digital camera it has only a 2X digital zoom, which is not really very useful, but it does have it anyhow. Another downside to this camera is its use of a serial cable to transfer the pictures from camera to computer. This isn't bad at all if you have only five or six photos, but more than twenty will be a tiring experience. The camera also comes with a tiny amount of internal memory (2MB). This is not nearly enough memory to allow a user to store photos from a week long vacation. To combat this shortcoming a CompactFlash memory card is a must. I personally have a 32MB Lexar card and it works splendidly. Rechargeable batteries are also a must. It also lacks a self timer.<br />Despite all this the camera does have several pluses. For one thing it is very easy to use. There are only five buttons on the back of the camera and two of those control the zoom feature. Deleting photos from memory can often be accomplished using only two buttons. This camera also comes with an LCD which is a welcome addition. I think the LCD is too bright and doesn't give you an accurate preview of the picture, but it is much better than having no LCD at all. It also has a slot that allows the user to install an inexpensive CompactFlash card in order to store many times over what the internal memory can store.<br />While you will never get really high quality photos from this camera, you will get lots of use out of it if you are content to store pictures on your hard-drive or a CD-RW. As I said before, this camera certainly has it's faults, but it also has plenty of reasons why it would make a fine beginner's digital camera.","I have owned and have a number of digital cameras, but the DC3200 is quite a performer for its spec. I bought mine second hand on ebay and I am very pleased with the clear clourful results. It's far better than the DC40, DC50 ,DC120 and DC240. The construction is quite rigid, but be careful with the lugs on the battery door. I mainly use it for for web sites in the lowest setting and you can even zoom in on the photo without too much loss of quality.<br />I like the dark grey/green colour as it's such a departure from the cheap silver that everyone seems to like. The colour of the cameras plastic is vertually scratch resistant. The only down side of the camera is that it eats batteries, even if you use a USB card reader to download images. Can be a bit slow when taking photos and the flash can be a bit too strong, but can be over come by placing your finger halfway over the flash. Digital zoom only works in the lowest setting, and there is no macro!<br />Apart from that the resultant photos are more colourful and clearer than many higher spec cameras. Kodak sent me lens cover and wrist strap free of charge!! Can't be faulted.","My kids gave me a DC3200 for Christmas in 2000. (Well, at least they think they did...) Overall, I like this camera. I have taken 1000's of photos with it, and I am quite happy with them. But I do have three main complaints about it, and two of them are related.<br />One, there is no tripod mount, and two, the speed of the camera. Due to how long it takes to take a photo, you MUST hold the camera perfectly still to get a good clear photo. However, you do get used to that, and since you can't use a tripod, I came up with something that works, although it is a bit crude.<br />To do this you need a standard tripod, and a piece of 2x4 that is the same length as the camera is wide. Drill a hole in the bottom of the 2x4 and make it so the tripod mount will screw into it, making sure it fits securely. Then take a strap of some sort that is strong enough to hold the camera, but doesn't block the viewfinder, lens, or buttons and or switches on the camera, and secure it to the 2x4. Then set your camera on top of it, and fasten it down. You end up with a crude tripod setup that works. When I started doing this, I had much better results overall.<br />My third complaint is about the focus and light levels. Although that is to be expected in a cheap camera. If you want quality, and have $5,000.00 to $10,000.00 laying around, a Nikon D1x is the kind. But how many people need that, or have that kind of money? The DC3200 is a good cheap camera.<br />A word of advice for whoever wrote the editorial review, and for Phil Smith, who said it takes forever to download photos and burns through batteries like crazy... Buy a CompactFlash Memory Card and a Card Reader that is compatible with the new version of USB ports, and toss that serial cable. What used to take hours (and tons of batteries) now takes meer seconds, and one set of batteries now lasts 100 times longer, because all you do with them is take photos. And for mdsmithers, who broke his battery compartment door, I did that too. One word, my friend... Rubberband. It works like a charm. :-)<br />Once you have your photos, I recommend Paint Shop Pro for photo editing. For less than $100.00 normally, it has all the bells and whistles you need to spruce up photos taken with a DC3200. You don't need to spend $1000.00 on a good photo editor.<br />If not for the speed of the camera, and the battery compartment door... I'd give this camera 5 stars for ease of use, and resulting photo quality.","Kodak DC3200 1MP Digital Camera<br /><br />This was the first really popular Kodak digital camera that was released just in time for Christmas 2000, and it was discounted to $100.<br /><br />It's difficult to compare this early Kodak digital to today's digital cameras. In the year 2000, the camera was replacing cheap point and shoot 35mm film cameras and 110 Kodak cameras in the target audience.  You could upload your photos to the World Wide Web on a modem, and share them online.  Kodak made home printers so that the consumer could print out the photos.  It was a huge hit, and probably more than any one camera, started the digital camera revolution.<br /><br />Mine still works, and I still occasionally use it.  But look at these 16 year old photos, of what it did back in 2001.","my mom has this camera.. for the price i guess its ok but a new updated camera i would recomend..<br /><br />i would sugest look at other cameras before you deside this one<br /><br />pros:<br /><br />a very simple camera<br /><br />not hard to use<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />no special features like b&w or vivid or timer or anything<br /><br />some pictures come out blurry.. dont take pictures too close up.. flash is not good for close-ups.. takes 4 batterys.. not a slim camera<br /><br />overall its ok if you dont want to spend lots of money and looking for just a very simple camera easy to use and dont want any fancy features you wont use","We bought this camera from a relative who wasn't ready for the digital age (even though it's extremely simple to use).  We've had it for 4 years now and it has never failed us yet!  We use it for every function and with our outdoors lifestyle and 2 active little girls, it's been dropped repeatedly with no problems in function--it's tough!  The only problem I have with it is the aforementioned battery door problem (which was already broken when we received it) but a thick rubberband has worked wonders and we have no problems with it draining batteries as long as our 3-year old doesn't pull the rubber band off!  This is a great camera for a first-time digital camera user and with the Compact Flash card, it holds an amazing amount of photos!  We do print ours out and they are just as clear (if not clearer) than a regular 35mm film camera when the digital is set to 'best' so it's really a bargain! This is a great camera folks, we highly recommend it!","one of my friends saw this cam for cheap 3 years ago so me and another of our buddies went out and bought the cam. it was our first digi cam and for what it is its great. nothing fancy here, just a simple point and shoot digi cam which produces some pretty good pics. i have took it anywhere and everywhere i have gone, and have always been happy with the pics, a few weeks back i updated to a Panasonic FZ-20, so this Kodak will live its life out in my glove box, never know when a cam will come in handy and this one is great. its rugged and tough so it will with stand the glove box tumbles.<br /><br />please remember that this camera i bought 3 years ago and in todays world its not worth the price of 150 though if you find it for 50 or less then by all means buy it.","This was my first digital camera.  It was given to me as a Christmas gift two years ago and it's still working to this day.  However, the door that holds the batteries in broke long ago so I have rubber bands tied around it to keep the batteries in place.  My Mom has the same camera bought at the same time mine was (she bought both of them together) and guess what?  Her battery door is broken too!  My second complaint is the lag time between when you actually press the button and when the actual image is recorded.  This is problematic when taking pictures of my toddler who is always in motion.  My third and final complaint is the flash, but I see that's already been discussed here so I won't dwell on it; let's just say put your sunglasses on because it will blind you!<br /><br />But I have taken literally thousands of pictures with this camera and as I said, after two years of steady use, it still works.  It's easy to operate.  It's affordable.  The quality of the pictures is good for emailing purposes (I rarely print them out).  I recently upgraded to the Canon Powershot A75, but I'll keep my Kodak around for a backup.  If you're on a tight budget and can't spring for anything pricey, or if you just want a really basic digital camera, you should be pleased with this one.","I bought this camera when it first came out in a package deal that also included a photo printer. I have hardly used the printer as it took to long to print and was difficult to navigate. I have loved the camera, though, until the tragic day that I accidentally dropped it the the battery door broke. We've tried, unsucessfully to keep it closed using all kinds of extra strong taping products, but it only holds long enough to take one picture and sometimes not even that long. It is way past its warranty and I knew it was being discontinued. I have just today purchased a newer camera with more up-to-date functions, but this one has been very good to me. It will be missed.","I've had this camera roughly 3 years (I got it when it first came out, which has been a while), and after all this time it still impresses me.  Whenever I first bought it, I used it maybe once or twice and (being the trendy person I am) ended up feeling embarrassed for carrying around such a clunky and awkward camera-- so i stashed it away for a couple years. But when I pulled it out and dusted it off a few months ago...something strange happened:  I fell in love with it and suddenly remembered all the reasons I bought it on that one infamous day a few years ago.  Forget the fact that the flash is a little bright at times.  Forget the fact that it has a fixed lens and a useless 2x digital zoom.  Those things are irrelevant.  What you need to know when thinking about buying this camera (new or used) is this:  It works.  It's easy.  It's endearing.  It no longer looks outdated-- I like to think of it as 'having a retro look to it.'  Even on the lowest quality picture setting, I'm still able to make good 4x6 prints, and when I use the 'Best' setting-- the 4x6 prints are flawless and you can even make 5x7's that look like they came from a quality 35mm film camera.  I recently got a 256mb CompactFlash card on sale-- and you can store almost 800 pictures at the highest pixel setting, or nearly 2,500 on the low setting.  A lifetime supply of film.  Long story short:  this camera has stood the test of time and it's even better now than it was when I first bought it.  Kind of like a fine wine, I suppose.  If you're looking for a cheap and easy camera and something that you can rely on for reliablity-- get this camera.  For it's age and it's price:  it's second to none.","While it is by no means the most feature rich digital camera available, it is a fine point-and-click camera that will get you good quality photos without busting the bank.<br />It has its pluses and its minuses like anything else, but it still remains a fine digital camera especially for first time buyers. It is pretty inexpensive but you don't really loose quality for a lower price. Its main shortcomings are that it has a flash that could be seen from the moon. It is way too bright for taking pictures up close in a dark situation. However, the flash can be diffused somewhat by securing a piece of tissue over the flash. Since it is a budget model digital camera it has only a 2X digital zoom, which is not really very useful, but it does have it anyhow. Another downside to this camera is its use of a serial cable to transfer the pictures from camera to computer. This isn't bad at all if you have only five or six photos, but more than twenty will be a tiring experience. The camera also comes with a tiny amount of internal memory (2MB). This is not nearly enough memory to allow a user to store photos from a week long vacation. To combat this shortcoming a CompactFlash memory card is a must. I personally have a 32MB Lexar card and it works splendidly. Rechargeable batteries are also a must. It also lacks a self timer.<br />Despite all this the camera does have several pluses. For one thing it is very easy to use. There are only five buttons on the back of the camera and two of those control the zoom feature. Deleting photos from memory can often be accomplished using only two buttons. This camera also comes with an LCD which is a welcome addition. I think the LCD is too bright and doesn't give you an accurate preview of the picture, but it is much better than having no LCD at all.

I'd give this camera 5 stars for ease of use, and resulting photo quality.","I've had this since they first came out.  Returned a Polariod for this one and it's 5 times better.  Slow picture upload to the computer, so I just go find something else to do while that's happening.  My son dropped it and the battery door won't close, so I have to use a rubber band to hold the door tight, it has to be closed for the camera to function.  I really like everything except the size.  It doesn't fit in a pocket very well.  Anybody have a battery door I can screw on there.","I have had this camera for a year and have had absolutely no problems with it. It wasn't hard to learn to use either. My young children use my camera to take pictures with it and are able to view the pictures they took if that tells you anything and they are elementary age. You do have to be still when taking pictures but it is not as bad as the cheaper cameras. We have had 3 digital cameras before this one, and this one is by far the best we've found for the price. When I have more money to spend on a camera, I will probably upgrade slightly. For this last year, it has been great and cheap. We bought a case to keep the camera in because it did not come with one. We got a memory card to go with it and can take way more pictures now. Also, we invested in a flash card reader so it is lots quicker to get the pictures off. It used to take a long time to do it the old way. If you have ever seen a bad digital camera image like from the JamCam or the cheaper Creative cameras, the Kodak images are nothing like that. The images do not look like alien photos with solar flares. The conditions might have to be right, but you can get a good image from this camera. One feature I like is that you can control if you want the flash on or off and some you cannot. I have not had film developed in a year now, and I have saved so much money. ... I think it is great that the price has gone so low. I would pay a hundred for it in a heartbeat. Used to, I would tell people to not buy a digital camera unless it was in the hundred dollar range because anything else would produce low quality images. This camera produces nice images. I also would take a regular camera for important functions that I wanted good pictures for, but now this is the only thing I use. It suits us just fine.","I can not belive how much the price has come down on the DC3200. I pay over [$$] for mine year and half ago. For this price you can pick one up for the kids. It has work well for use on trips to the zoo. But if you think you can get some good shots at christmas or the every moving new baby-forget it! It did take some nice shots at my brothers' wedding. You need to get close to the subjuct and not very much movement to get the shot. This camera is NOT forgiving. It will however make good 5x7 size pictures, but it is not too good for larger sizes. I did have some large size photos come out. The larger the more blurry they will become. We bought this thinking we would save some money on developing cost. I think we may have spent it on on ink. It is good for basic still somewhat close shots that you will be archiving with a cd burner and to lets the kids learn the art taking pictures. At this price do buy then you will know what you will what. It's a great price i might even buy one for my mom she loves my camra, but I am wanting a lot more. Like getting the shot even it the kids move a miro amount. No kid will stay still very long even olan mills has trouble with my 3 boys at one shot.","This camera is to the Digital Camera realm what the old 126's were to portable cameras back in the days. If you remember 110 cameras, these were the most portable, but the pix were not great. 126's had a good pic and were reasonably portable. (Remember the box of Flash Cubes) The DC3200 camera gives a very nice 4\"X6\" picture. But, If you don't use the flash, you will tend to get fuzzy pics if you are not steady. The camera shot also occurs about 1/2 a second after you press the shutter release. This takes some getting used to, but it's not a great disincentive considering you can shoot around 400 pix at the best resolution with a 128Mb CF. Download these to you PC and pick the good ones for developing. I get my pix done as 4\"X6\"s and they look great.","This camera provides excellent quality photos, but because it is a serial port connection, downloading pictures is a slow and painful process. I guess you get what you pay for. Still, I would recommend this camera to those who want good quality for less money.","This was my first digital camera. I bought it a year ago and I have had a lot of fun with it. It is great for e-mailing pictures to your friends. The image quality for e-mail purposes is very good. Also I love that you can see the picture you just took in the LCD screen. I delete a lot of bad pictures before I get one I like.<br />This camera will not replace your regular camera however. The 1 megapixel resolution is not high enough to print a large regular photo quality picture. If you set the camera to its highest resolution you might be able to print an acceptible 5x7 photo. The memory included with the camera is not enough. It will hold two or so highest quality photos and about 16 normal e-mail quality photos. I would recommed you buy the compact flash card to extend the memory.<br />If you want to use this camera mainly for e-mailing photos, the Kodak 3200 will do very well. If you have visions of creating your own professional photo processing center please save your money a little longer and get a 2 or 3 MP camera. I eventually plan to get another digital camera with more kick, but I am content to use this one for now.","Picture quality is good for casual snapshots, purists with high expecations [and big budgets] should look elsewhere.<br />Battery life was a pleasant surprise - way more than I read in most reveiws<br />The flash is too bright for close ups, but here's a quick solution: Get a small roll of 1/2\" double face foam tape with the removable paper.

The main reason I give this camera 4 out of 5 stars is because of the price. ...Here's the skinny:<br />The goodies: the price, lcd screen, easy to use, good picture, software easy to use.<br />The badies : no timer, bulky-try putting this cam in your pocket, no lens cover, low internal memory (5 shots in best mode), serial connection slow, blurry image if subject moves, zoom ONLY works on the lowest resolution setting, intermittent ~3 secs before you can take the next shot (no continuous shots).<br />Required necessities: atleast 32mb flash memory card, usb port memory card reader(unless you like waiting a long time for your pictures to develop using the given serial port), batteries and charger.<br />so look to spend an additional ~$80 on extras...which is more than what i paid for the camera!!!<br />I reccommend purchasing this camera if you seldom will use one and just like sharing pictures via e-mail. If you want to print photo quality pictures this does the job, but other cams do it much better. Other things to keep in mind: DO NOT use flash with the subject within a 5ft range. You will have taken a picture of Casper =). Make sure your subject is still, otherwise you'll get blurry images. LCD viewer is slow to catch up if you move the camera around to quickly. Don't like the fact that you have to wait ~3 secs just to take the next shot. OK overall.","Do you have a pocket PC?  Than you can use it to transfer photos from the camera to your desktop much faster!!","Are you looking to begin digital photography? How about just looking for a new camera that is modern, and won't break the budget? If so, then this is the camera for you!<br />When I bought my DC3200, I had never owned a digital camera.

Buy a FlashCard, and a FlashCard Reader (it will save you a lot of time waiting for slow downloads), and you will have more room than you know what to do with.<br />The only limiting factors, are the low zoom rates (1x or 2x), and the fixed lens, but then what can you expect from a camera this inexpensive?

I followed the instructions to view the pictures on the computer (we're talking a sentence at a time here!)  The CD basically installed itself.  The cable plugs into the computer and into the camera.  That's it. There were the beautiful indoor pictures on my monitor.  Easy to manipulate with on-screen instructions, then print out.

(($) for camera, ($) for 32meg CF).<br />I am always refering people to this camera  for it's price and quality.. if you would like to see some of the shots taken from this camera hop over to  My gallery -- (...) and see for yourself<br />it could use a little work on battery usage but find rayovac renewals or normal Nickel Metal Hydride batteries to be a benefit.","I use these units constantly, I manage a production co.<br />the sixteen photographers I have, all use these 10 to 35 times a day. all of them are butterfingers dropping them once or twice a month. But the cameras take it, and keep giving us great shots.<br />The fixed lens are off just a bit on some of them, but once your aware of that, you can't help but have great shots.","I bought this camera 2 months ago and have been very pleased with the performance. Overall the camera is basic and very simple to use. Outside shots come out clean with very good colors. However, when taking interior shots the flash can be unpredictable and often overexposes alot of shots under 5' away. Sometimes just experimenting with the flash helps.<br />The software, like the camera, is good, basic, and simple to use. It's not going to let you do alot fancy, high tech stuff, however it will let you do some simple modifications; contrast, red-eye, sepia, etc.<br />As with all digital cameras it is a battery hog. I invested, and suggest you will need to do the same, in rechargable batteries. Also, the 2MB of memory is not nearly sufficient and you will probably end up buying a flash card of some type.<br />So, overall I am very pleased with the camera for the price. Just keep in mind this is not the top of the line, but you should definently get you money's worth.","I bought this camera 2 months ago and have been very pleased with the performance.

This is why I rate this item a three.","I purchased this camera for my 8 year old daughter. she loves it. she took 96 pictures in the first two days. this camera is very easy to operate. I also puchased a 32 meg compact flash card and a card reader (USB), the camera does not come with USB.","I purchased this camera from Dell with some Dell gift certificates that I had to use.  I really didn't need this camera as I have a Kodak DC280.  I thought the 3200 would be a good \"bang around\" camera.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when I started taking pics with it.  The quality of outdoor pictures is excellent.  Indoors, the flash will drown out any image that you are too close to.  Indoor lighting was sufficient with the flash turned off.  I have taken approximately 75 pictures with the camera and I am still on my first set of batteries.  This camera (as with all Kodak digitals) is extremely easy to use with menus that are clear and concise.<br />My only negative comment is the absence of USB connectivity.  I would suggest that anyone buying this camera also purchase a Compact flash memory card (the 2mg internal memory is not sufficient)AND a USB card reader.","I bought this camera about 6 months ago, and I love it.  It is my first digital purchase, as I am a beginner in the digital world.  As a starting-out digital camera, it's fantastic.  It's easy to use, great pictures, small enough to be convenient - yet big enough to be easy to handle.  The LCD screen is convenient, because you can see exactly what you're taking a picture of, when you take it.<br />The camera has 3 different levels of quality for pictures.  The high quality pictures won't allow you to zoom, but then again, you can zoom and crop the pictures later, so it's just as nice.  With the low quality pictures, there is the benefit of a 2X zoom, which allows you to get right up on the object for some good detil.<br />The flash has 3 settings... On, automatic, and off, so you can choose the best lighting for your situation.<br />A complete, easy to use, windows based menu makes this camera easy and fun to use, and with the memory card (optional) allows you to take anywhere from 40 to 120 pictures at a time - depending on the quality you choose.<br />Overall, a great little camera that gets the job done with all the quality of 35mm and the benefit of digital.  I highly recommend this camera for almost everyone, unless you need the super high quality and zoom capability.  Trust me, this one wont let you down.","I bought this camera and thought it was too simple for me.  The picture quality is awesome and they print great.  The only down side to this camera is that pictures taken at a very close range come out over exposed because of the bright flash.<br />I returned this camera for a Fuji Finepix model.  Fuji seems to have it going on with digital cameras in my opinion.  This Kodak camera is good for beginners but since I enjoy using digital cameras I needed something smaller and better.<br />If your looking for perfect quality on every angle I would recommend a Fuji model.  If this is a first buy, then this camera would suite your needs because the prints are great and the photos are of great quality.  I enjoyed this camera in the short time I owned it but my demands are high for a camera to be worth while.","My friend has this camera, and it works so much better than the camera I have at work which cost almost 400 bucks.  Last night I purchased the HP215, because it is a 1.3MP.  I tell you, I'm taking it back to get this camera.  The quality of the HP215 doesn't compare with the quality of this camera.  They come oou kinda yellow, and somewhat pixelated.  Not this camera.  It's the same as a point & Shoot 35mm.  I would definately recommend this camera to anyone.  The reason for only 4 stars is that it doesn't have a timer, and it doesn't have USB capability, so uploading photos to your computer will be slow, but worth the wait.  Hope this helps","This is a good, solid basic digital camera with few bells and whistles but serves the job where few bells and wistles are needed.  Mine stays in my briefcase (in a bag that I purchased separatly at a garage sale) and comes in handy from time to time as needed around the office or client sites, where I don't want to take my expensive camera.<br />I also would recommend this as a starting camera for young kids to use, 8 and up, since it is simple to operate.  The LCD display, although it acts like a slow scan video, will help a child learn to point the camera to where he/she want to take the picture, while teaching patience in getting a good picture.  The transfer software is not complicated and forgives the user if they forget to do something, like turn the camera on to transfer mode before starting the transfer.<br />I do recommend that a purchaser get a at least a 16mb flash memory card, the USB card reader, and the AC power supply for this device.","This is good entry level camera. The price you can get it for (shop around) is okay for this resolution camera. Beginners and children will particularly benefit from a camera that is inexpensive and has a LCD view screen.<br />A few issues that should be pointed out:<br />- It does not have a USB connection. Downloads from the camera are via serial cable.<br />- The camera supports CF media. Buy some and a USB CF reader, it beats the serial download.<br />- Get rechargeable batteries, all digital cameras eat batteries.<br />- The flash is very bright on object/people close up.<br />All in all, a good entry-level camera. Let the kids have a go with it.","I think this Kodak DC3200 camera is great.  The quality of photos is outstanding & it's easy to use.  I'm never going back to 35mm photography!","This camera is an great value and I am very pleased with it.  The photo quality and color is excellent.  The video output that allows you to view your photos on a TV is nice feature, for those times when your computer is not available.  The serial port interface is slower than the USB interface that most new cameras come with, but it is a plus if you do not have a USB interface on your computer.  Some say the battery life is to short, but I have been pleased with battery life so far.  Like most digital cameras, the DC3200 comes with inadeqaute memory, so plan to buy a separate memory pack.  My average photo uses just under 0.2 Megabytes of memory.<br />The negatives are:<br />1. Close up photos with flash are over-exposed.<br />2. There is a delay (perhaps 1 sec) between the time when you push the button and the exosure occurs.  This makes action photos very difficult.<br />3. You cannot take phoses in quick succession because of the processing delay. (perhaps 3 or 4 seconds beteen photos)","I bought this camera bundled with PPM200. I took some shots and printed using PPM200. Great pictures!! I recomment you to buy the PPM bundle package as you get this camera with a photoprinter<br />I observed the following drawbacks with this camera:<br />1. 3X digital zoom makes picture very distorted.<br />2. Close-ups will be washed out by the flash<br />3. Battery (4 AA size) will be exausted very fast<br />It is really worth for what you are paying.","This was my first Digital Camera,<br />Bad Points: It looks Boxy....<br />Uses batteries really quicky (but then again... all digital cameras do...)<br />Good Points: Easy to use<br />Quite Cheap<br />Not hard to hold<br />Can stand a few drops (I dropped it about 6 times)<br />I was very pleased with this camera actually, I took many pictures with it and would recommend it if this is your first digital camera. It's not that hard to use or handle and unless you are very sensitive on how squarish it looks I think this camera is great.!","Yesterday I bought this camera in bestbuy for a very good deal of ... as it was on sale.<br />And I bought 32Mb memory,rechrgeable cells and camera case all for just ....<br />Alreay I took around 140 photos in just one day and I started using camera without reading the Kodak Book.<br />So simple to use.Picture quality is really great and today I am sending some of my picts to my mom and dad in India.<br /><br />Now let us see some of the advantages and disadvantages.<br />Adv:<br />1.Simple and Easy to use.<br />  2.Good camera for the price.<br />  3.Quality of snaps taken in Light is very good.<br />  4.And s/w which comes with this camera is the best.<br />  5.With compact flas card you can take many many snaps without any problem.<br />Disadv:<br />  1.Pictures taken in Dark or low sunlight are very very bad.<br />  2.In low sunlight Flashlight will not flash because of internal setting and b'cause of that photo quality is too bad.<br />  3.Uses 4 AA batteries.<br />  4.No camera cap.<br /><br />But Adv > DisAdv(5>4).<br />SO please go and buy this camera right now, otherwise ...","This is my first digital camera and I love it. It was easy to use right from the box. It takes great pictures, and I had some prints made from the photos I had taken, and you can't tell them from a regular camera print. Some people have stated they wish it came with a lens cap, well I called Kodak to order one and they said yes they had it, and when I asked how much he said he would send it to me free of charge. I dont think you can get better service then free. Great Job Kodak. and all of you who need a lens cap call Kodak. Hope this helps.","The instructions, ease of use and hook up was just, 'THE BEST'","I recently bought this camera as a bundle package with the Kodak PPM200 printer. After reading some of the reviews online both negative and positive I decided to give this package a try. I DO NOT REGRET IT!!!! The camera itself is very easy to use. The quality of the pictures are excellent. The printer is great, very convenient. NO need to upload to your PC. Just pop the flashcard into the printer and presto great quality pictures within minutes. You can upload to your PC with this camera but I found that since it has a serial port connection it can sometimes take up to 5 minutes but the solution is to purchase a flashcard reader. You uploads are instantly on your PC. I am glad I took the chance and bought it.","It is a terrific camera for the price, I bought it for my son and I got engaged to it. Good pictures, of course some pixelation at 6X9 print. It should come with at least a lens cap and a video out cord. The LCD display is very good but a little slow when moving. Another gap is the lacking of a case for protection. Anyway...you may buy it if you can live with these little drawbacks.","I bought it last Christmas and took a lot of pictures since then.  It gave me a lot of fun sitting in front of screen and reviewing the photo of happy moment.  It's very easy to use and very reliable.  I don't know if it says it's water-proof, but I brought it to Niagara Falls and took a few good ones right on the boat while everyone was soaked and the pictures are great!  It never malfunctioned.  I climbed Fuji Mt. when I visited Tokyo this July and it works well on the top of the mountain, 3700m high!  The picture file is about 200k if you choose compressed but it looks very clear even in fullscreen view mode.  I always use the picture I took as my wallpaper.  I got a 32M memory from friend and that could contain about 40 pictures.  It runs out of battery before you fill up the memory!  I use 4 rechargbles so it's not too bad.  As long as you do not use the LCD to review the pictures, the battery could last very long.  I love this guy, but feel losing something when I see it's price has fallen from $... last year to $... now.  I would say it has the best performance/price value in today's market.  Highly recommend it!","I am from Turkey.The price of the camera in Turkey is 300 dolar But I buy it from US when I was visit US.The camera is good it funny to use it .good picture quality.","My first digital camera and I'm very pleased.  Up to this point I've used a variety of regular 35mm cameras.  This camera is a good intro to digital at an excellent entry price with very acceptable quality.  Obviously for more money comes more features and higher quality, but if you're just going to have fun with snapshots, pictures for auctions, and general usage, particularly internet usage, you'll be pleased.<br />One flaw, however, cost it a star in my rating- the flash is too bright on subjects at typical snapshot range indoors or at night.  I normally have to turn off the flash and settle for room lighting, but so far I've managed to get decent pictures if I hold the camera still enough.  But forget it in the dark, unless the subjects are far enough away- like maybe outdoors- and then you can use the flash.  Also needs a self-timer.<br />As others say, get the rechargeable batteries and 64mg Compact Flash card (price of these has really dropped.)  And I don't mind the time to transfer pictures to the PC using the included serial cable, but some folks may do a high enough volume, maybe for business, that an investment in a USB card reader is worth it.<br />Don't worry, if this is in the price range you're looking for ... and if you can live with the flash thing, I doubt you'll regret this camera.  It's a good value.","...and I did a lot of research before buying this one. Unless you're a fine art photographer or *really* want to make poster size blow-ups of your shots, you don't *need* any more resolution than this offers! ...so why let the marketing droids convince you otherwise and pay a premium for it? This is an *extremely* easy to use camera that takes sharp photos in all daylight conditions. In extremely poor light the flash may slightly wash out things that are too close but that is the *only* caveat I have to offer. Most important for Linux users is the CompactFlash. With a PCMCIA adapter CompactFlash cards simply appear as another filesystem on Linux, so it's easy to transfer photos to a PC running Linux. (I don't use Windoze so I haven't even loaded the included Kodak software and can't vouch for it.) Hurry and buy this while it's available. Sooner or later \"They\" will decide everyone needs at least 6 megapixels.","It takes very nice pictures, excepting at night or dark places.","A very simple camera that yields acceptable photos with a minimum of fuss. You won't be able to fit many pictures into the internal memory, so be prepared to spend at least $... more for a memory card. One annoying thing - once you have that memory card, you have to remove it in order to record into the internal memory. While this camera works for me, I think that it is worth the extra money to buy a camera with a zoom lens. The 2x digital zoom on this camera is useless - yes, images are magnified 2x, but the resolution goes down 2x as well.","This camera is the greatest piece of art I have ever seen. I<br />mean it includes almost verything you need to produce perfectly<br />Incredible pictures with a high resolution.<br />THe Positives ++ of this digital camera are : 1)  Includes everything you need to start taking incredibly high<br />quality photos in just seconds!<br />2) Great image quality !<br />3) 2x Zoom really helps a lot!<br />4) There is a color Lcd screen on the back ! This feature is wonderful! You can see what you take right after you take it!<br />5)The price is affordable<br />The only bad part of this is that it is awfully slow to upload to your computer! It would be a bomb if they used USB! It takes almost 2 minutes to upload one good quality pic! That is awfully slow! I tried another USB digital camera before and each picture took about a second to upload For example if i took 35 pics with it, it would upload in approximately 30 seconds! Thats awesome!<br />If you are looking for a great camera for a great price , don't hesitate! Buy now!  P.S : I found this item cheaper at Circuit City! I suggest you get it there Like i did LOL:)","After pursing photography for years on film using SLRs, I have been looking forward to getting into digital photography, but have shyed away for some time because of the high price of digital cameras.  But when I saw that I could get a megapixal camera for this price, I decided to give it a go.  Though the DC3200 does not offer the advance features of my SLR, it offerse everything that a good snapshot camera in it's price range does.  Though it comes only with 2megs of internal ram, I bought a 16meg compactflash card with it and have not had a problem with picture storage.  Unlike some other lower priced digital camera's kodak incorages the use of rechargable batteries (Ni-HM), so I have also purchased a set and a charger and have found the camera wonderful fun.  If you are looking to get into digital photography at a low cost, you can't miss with this one.  The only problem I found with this camera was that it takes an exsposer reading when the button is half pressed, if you foget to take the reading in advance, it will delay your shot.","This camera is ready right out of the box.  Easy to use.  The software is also easy to install and use.<br />Don't forget about the $30 rebate!<br />Hard to pass this one up!","Well,I half to say I really love this camera!When I first got it I found it a bit complicated but,after having it for a few days it became alot easier for me.There are alot of good and bad points.  The camera was quite easy to use I felt.It was small,light and convinent to use.For one thing it only weighs as much as 2 or 3 computer mice.second of all,it is really small and can fit right in your pocket no matter how big or small (unless you want your baby to cary it).Third of all,it's really easy to use.It's like a point and shoot camera.Their is only about a 2 second delay betwen shots and 3 seconds using internal memory.Their aren't alot of buttons either so it's not like a console on Startrek.The zoom was quite pleasing for taking shots of things at a distance.Since it also has a flash you can take pictures in complete darkness,the flash can also be turned off so you don't get a comepletely white picture.The storage is also quite impressive.The internal memory is 2 mb so setting the quality to the 3rd best (out of 3) you can get roughly 30 pictures.You can also get a 256 mb flash card if you are planning on doing some heavy duty shooting.However,cards like these don't come very cheap;usually about $300.The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen will let you know what the camera's looking at.In other words,whatever is on the LCD screen is what the camera will take a picture of.So \"NEVER EVER\"look through the little window on the top of the camera when taking a picture.Otherwise you won't get exactly the position of the person,place or thing exactly as you had hoped.And last,but not least if the picture you just took well...SUCKS!Than you can just go back and delete it enstead of wasting a picture like you would on a normal camera.  Now the bad stuff;sorry to break the news to you though,but not everything's perfect.The worst thing about it is the enourmous power consumption by the LCD screen.You can't have the camera on for 20 minutes without the battery running out.Next is the zoom.For one thing it only magnifies the pictures 2x so you really can't get that much closer.Plus it's digital.An optical zoom changes the size of the Iris in the lense so the object seems closer than it really is.Digital zoom just electronically magnifies the pixels that make up the picture so the quality of the shot decreases.And finally,but LEAST importantly the delete time for internal memory.To delete just one picture from the camera's storage system takes like 6 seconds!So try not to screw up when you don't have a memory card.  So overall this camera is awesome for an amature or a professional and I would recommend it to both.I hope that this review helped you.<br />  HAVE A NICE DAY!!!","I just bought this camera. I love it. i have wanted a dig cam for a long time now. This camera is great.  Pros: great pictures, LCD screen, Flash card compatible (for more memory), zoom, small in size, etc.  Cons: no lens cover and only 2 mb memory, and flash is too bright. no lens cover is fine, you can buy one ... the memory thing is ok, cause you can just buy a memory card thing. the flash is too bright SOMETIMES and makes the person too light. You should get this camera. Most digital camera's are like $..., this is a good camera to buy. i wouldn't hesitate. i would buy it right now. its worth it, trust me.","Just wanted to let everyone know, that I just bought this camera on a trip to see my parents.  I own a Sony Mavica FD-93, which is a very high end model.  I have found that this Kodak produces very similar results, for a 10nth of the cost.  It is much easier to use, and the camera is tiny compared to most.  I do agree that the fact there is no lens cover is annoying, but I purchased one for less than five bucks, so big deal.  I say KUDOS to Kodak, for coming out with a simple to use, affordable digital.  ONE THING ABOUT THE PRODUCT REVIEW ABOVE.  There is a claim that there is NO ZOOM LENS!  That is false!  There is a Zoom lens, it is not perfect, but it does work!","Overall, I love it.<br />Pros: - good pictures quality - Bright LCD - Easy to use, easy to understand controls.  On the other hand, I  alway have to refer to the user manual for my Canon A50.<br />Cons: - The flash is too bright for show distance shots. - No lens cover - No self-timer","I bought one a week ago and, like most people here, am more than happy with it. I list more dislikes than likes simply because other people have gone over the good parts already.<br />Likes:<br />Look/Feel: It feels and handles like a point-and-shoot 35mm. Kodak didn't try to reinvent the wheel.<br />Performance: I started out lookng at a cheap 640 by 480 camera. This is a great improvement. There is a high enough resolution to let you trim your images to correct poor aim or reduce the size before emailing.<br />Ease of Use: Worked great right out of the box.<br />Dislikes:<br />Serial Cable: It takes forever to download photos and burns through batteries like crazy.<br />Small Memory: 2Meg is not large enough to be practical, perhaps 6 pictures at the highest resolution.<br />Software: The \"Pictures Now\" software isn't very good. It runs very slowly on my AMD 380 PC. But, it is free. I've been using \"Vueprint\", a shareware package from Hamrick.com for quite a few years and it's phenomenal.<br />No Lens Cap: What were they thinking? For much less than a dollar they could have included one and I'm not spending .... I've been looking around the house for something I can use for one.<br />I'd buy this camera again in a heartbeat. It's a winner. By adding a 64Meg memory card and a USB interface I've eliminated my two biggest gripes for .... I can now take somewhere around 200 pictures at the highest resolution at one time and download them in about a minute without using up the camera's batteries.","Extremely less expensive than other cameras comparible and it serves wonderfully. For anyone just wanting a camera to send pictures via e-mail and/or web this is the camera. It's also high enough resolution to make wonderful prints.","I purchased a Kodak DC3200 a little over a month ago and have found it very useful for taking pictures of my little grandson.  There is one problem however which I cannot rectify. If I am too close to the subject, the flash makes the subject appear too light.  The background is fine, but the subject in the foreground is too white.  The camera is set to auto-flash which should correct this problem, but it doesn't. I have to take the picture further away and crop it to get what I want.  This also loses resolution. Any suggestions would be helpful.","I have wanted a digital camera for SO long, but never wanted to pay the high price for some of the \"necessities\". This camera fit the bill. Within 10 minutes of opening the box, I was taking pictures and emailing them to grandma. Within and hour, I was taking pictures and loading auctions to help pay for my new toy! Yes, it could have come with an AC adapter,lens cover, etc. BUT, in my case, I would prefer to buy that next month. You can always add on buy buying a memory card, USB flash card reader, etc. That would make it faster, but for my purposes, as a \"mom\", this camera really works well for me and my budget!! Oh, I might add, I did have to call Kodak for one teeny little question and they had my question answered in 30 seconds or less! So, they do back their product! If you go to their website, you can even play an interactive demo of this camera and see actual photographs!  One feature that I really love is that I am able to crop and modify pics all from one place before sending them out. No more wasting download time on boring backgrounds!!  So, if you need/want an inexpensive solution to the digital camera, this would be it. If you want all the add ons and want to pay the price now, you would go with  a more expensive camera. However, the quality of the pic is tremendous!","Bought mine before year-end, looking to replace a first generation Casio QV-10. Let me tell you: if you can get it, buy it! Sure, it feels a little cheap, but the features are great, picture quality is surprising, and the cost . . . well. Buy a 64MB CompactFlash card, USB reader, and NiMH rechargeable batteries (4-AA) and you'll be in picture taking heaven! For about $350 (with all of the named accessories), I can take over 300 \"good quality\" (compressed, JPEG) or almost 200 \"best quality\" (uncompressed JPEG) pictures which upload to my PC in SECONDS!","I'm not at all a \"photographer\" or a camera expert, but in my opinion this is a great little camera for its quality and price.  I had priced dozens of cameras from 1-megapixel and up.  What you get with the Kodak DC3200 is a camera that you can use to take your everyday photos: birthdays, vacations, kids in the yard.  NO, you can't make posters out of any of the pictures you take, but have you ever?<br />I use a 64MB Compact Flash card that I share with another device.  While I've never used the entire card, Kodak stated that at high quality you can get over 200 pictures, at regular quality over 800, and at lowest quality (they don't say).  You would need 34 rolls of film for 800 photos, but you can reuse the flash card.<br />The DC3200 is not fancy, complicated or expensive.  It is an easy to use, everyday digital camera.","As an avid 35mm photographer, I've put off going digital because the cameras themselves are so limited compared to SLRs.<br />So, first: The 3200 is a fixed focus, wide angle camera. It has a digital zoom feature, but it's only available when your using the lowest quality image setting. And, as a very picky 35mm photographer, I should point out that even at the higher quality settings, you shouldn't expect to get high-quality prints larger than snap-shot size.<br />*BUT*: Given the resolution of the camera, the quality of the images is excellent; My first use of the camera was on a disney vacation, and I gave it a huge work-out. I added a 48 meg memory card to it, shot hundreds of photos, and really appreciated the ability to delete pictures right out of the camera - that way you can go crazy take a ton of pictures, then delete the ones that didn't work out.<br />I'd give the camera five stars, but the fact that it doesn't come with a video cable or memory card is kind of frustrating. The built in 2 megs isn't enough memory to do anything except test the camera.","I bought this camera for my mother, and I was afraid that she wouldn't use it because it would be too complicated.  I have an older Olympus digital camera that is complicated to use and the software is weird, too.  My mother was emailing me Christmas pictures within an hour of unwrapping the thing!  She loves it, and I enjoy all of the photos she sends.  I only have one detraction from my review and that is the flash: it is too powerful.  I think you can set it to be lighter, though my mom hasn't read that far yet.","Everything about this camera is 100% great with a few exceptions.  They are:<br />1.  The power on light (green) is right next to the manual viewfinder.  Having a green light this close to the veiwfinder makes it harder to use.  Using the 1.6 inch LCD screen is more of a WYSIWYG type of picture also when I compared both views.<br />2.  No lens cover.  A lens cover attached with a small rope would have made this more attractive in buying, even at $10 more.<br />3.  AC adapter non-standard voltage (not included).  A 7 volt adapter is propritary item, that cannot be bought cheap, like the standard variable voltage adapters, even though the camera uses four 1.5 volt batteries, 6 volts, which is standard.<br />4.  USB transfer would have been nice, but I think this would have inflated the price too much.  Serial is slow, but its affordable, and it does not affect quality of the picture.<br />Good things are:<br />1.  The pictures turn out well.  Included software makes it easy to send pictures to the PC, cleaned if necessary, and to be printed.<br />2.  The 1.6 LCD color display is nice.  Every digital camera should have one.  Don't buy one if not included.  Its nice to see what you have taken, and what you are about to take.<br />3.  The TV hookup to view pictures from the camera is nice feature to see the quality of a photo taken.  I was surprised the cable was not included for this feature.  If the cable would have added $5 to the price, it should have been included.<br />4.  It came with batteries.  1.2 volt re-chargable NiCads can be used as well.<br />5.  Built in flash.  Auto or manual.  Nice.  I think most (if not all) digital cameras have them.<br />6.  FlashCard memory expansion slot (standard).  Room for extra room is always nice.  Orphaned products, except for Toasters, don't last long on the market.  Another example is 7 volt adapters.  ;-)  They won't be around forever.","I got this camera for my girlfriend for Christmas and we were taking pictures in less then 10 minutes.  The quick step guide is great and anyone can use it.  She has taken photography classes and has a Canon 35mm camera with a 300 zoom lense, so she's an advanced picture taker.  This camera makes it easy for her to do quick shots and scan through them to delete pictures that she doesn't like.  Also easy to carry around and small enough to fit in a small camera bag.  I wish it had more internal memory, but the cards are not that expense, compared to developing pictures that you don't want.  Great camera, great price and we recommend it to anyone that's looking for something easy to do pictures on the internet.","I have been searching for a megapixel camera for some time, well my time has come! The Kodak DC3200 is very basic, but has very good image quality. CCD image devices are NOT all the same and Kodak has a great one.  The camera is very compact.  I know, it looks huge in the pictures.  The camera also has some very nice power saving features (which are annoying at first)that do extend battery life a good 25%.  Once a new user quits fiddling with the LCD view screen, he will realize the benefits of these power saving features.  To maximize camera function go out and immediately buy a flash card.  Look on Amazon for the Lexar 16mb compactflash card with the JumpShot USB cable.  With it I can download 187 pictures in less than a minute.  Downside is that internal 2mb memory is bypassed when using the flash card but it is no big deal.  If you use the 2mb internal memory it can be downloaded to the flash card so you NEVER have to use the slow poke serial port.  Try this camera, you'll like it.  Better yet, add the Lexar flash card and JumpShot to your purchase!","No bells and certainly no whistles.  This camera is for my son (9 yrs.), so I wanted to stay under $200.  The fact is that this camera takes great  pictures, but I think it stinks that Kodak won't include the lens cap and the video out cable.  It cost me a whopping $20 (from Kodak) for the round piece of plastic and the cable.  Other cons: no mount for a tripod, no self timer, clobbers batteries, slow serial interface.  I understand that $200 is not much for a digital camera and this one takes great pictures, but the lens cap and video cable thing bugs me.","What a great buy!  I was looking for a digital camera to use with my fledgeleng business, as well as for personal use.  I purchased a DC3200 and could not be happier with it.  It takes very sharp, clear photos; has very true color reproduction; and is so easy to use.  I recommend it for everyone looking for a great buy in a digital camera.","I LOVE this camera, I am not technically inclined at all, so was VERY happy to see how easy this camera is to use, the pictures it takes are great quality, when I upload them to my computer I see no difference between them and pictures I scan that I have had developed. It has a great flash, the LCD screen is really nice, the software it comes with is awesome, it even lets you make pictures black and white, you can remove red eye and make all kinds of changes to the pictures. A kid could use this camera it is so easy to use. I wanted to check the camera out before I bought attachments for it, but now I wish I had purchased the 32 mb picture card with it, I am going to order it now, even the 2mb that it holds is good enough and lets you store quite a few pictures, I am having a baby in a few weeks and this camera is going to the hospital with  me so I can take a ton of pictures of my new born :)","My wife just gave me this camera for my birthday and I can sum up my feelings in one word: WOW<br />I have a high end Kodak digital camera that doesn't always get used due to it's size, weight and cost. The DC3200 is a perfect addition to my collection of cameras! It's point and shoot easy and the picture quality is excellent. If you plan on printing standard 3x5 or 4x6 pictures, this camera will give you super results.<br />Hey, it's not fancy by any means. You turn it on and press the shutter (so to speak) button. You can use the onboard memory (only 2 Meg so you can't fit very many pics on it) but when you add a larger (15 Meg or so) card...you have the ability to take a ton of pics.<br />You'll need to buy some rechargable batteries and a memory card reader to complete your package. Add a good photo program like MS Picture-it and your digital darkroom is ready to go.<br />If your looking for a point and shoot digital camera at a VERY good price this is it.","I got one of these 2 1/2 weeks ago and have to say, for the price it can't be beat. It takes awesome pictures and has many features not found on cameras in its price range. For under $200, you can't find anything better. The resolution is perfect for web or smaller printouts(5x7 or 4x6). Kodak has packed a lot of features into this camera and has kept the price down by leaving out the AC adaptor and video to TV cable. The internal memory does not hold very many high res pictures, and downloading by serial cable can be very time consuming. Getting a memory card of at least 16MB is highly recommended. Some features left out that would have nice: 1) tripod mount 2) self timer. These were left out, but not a big deal.","This particular camera is a great buy. I have never used a digital camera before and the ease of this one is great. The first time I held it I knew how to use it. Downloading time is fairly quick, 25 pictures took about 4-5 minutes, of course using a 900 mhz machine. Picture quality is excellent even in the good mode. If you have it on the best mode the pictures are remarkable. I have enjoyed the use of the camera, and if you are a first time buyer of a digital camera I highly recommend this one.","I was looking for a low-end camera that would produce good pictures to email to family, but I was suprised at the quality output of the Koday DC3200 Digital Camera.  Talk about instant gratification.  Within minutes of opening the box, I was snapping digital images and emailing them to family, several of them impressed by the clarity a crispness of the images.  I did have to use Adobe Photoshop to tone down a bright spot where the flash picked up a glare.  My only complaint is that Kodak did not include a lens cap or a CompactFlash Removable Memory Card.  Either way, the Kodak DC3200 Digital Camera is a bargain for the quality digital images that it produces.  I will definitly be stuffing someone's Christmas stocking with a Kodak DC3200 Digital Camera this year.","This is a pretty good deal on a Kodak 1-megapixel camera. What is a 1-megapixel camera you ask? Well, it's about the maximum resolution (the best) you would want for a digital camera whose main task will be taking pictures for emailing or website posting. Higher resolution makes for larger files which require not only more time to upload (i.e. to transfer to an email or to post on a website), but more time to download for your reader. In fact, the new 3-megapixel cameras make photo files so large that a person with a well-tuned 56k (regular modem) connection would have to wait almost 6 minutes to download (view) a single photo! This particular camera then is well-suited to internet apps, and you'll probably use it on lower than 1-megapixel resolution most of the time.  PROS: 1) Price 2) Quality  3) USB connection  4) CompactFlash (expandable) memory  5) Through-the-lens shooting. CONS: 1) Limited zoom (digital zooms are poor relatives of optical zooms)  2) High battery usage  3) Mediocre flash capability.","Really nice digital camera which won't be a waste if you get a high-end one later.  Inexpensive but not cheaply made... a great companion for a laptop.  Pictures are excellent.  If you use a Flash Memory and a reader or a PCMCIA adapter, downloading is fast and you don't drain batteries.  LCD can be shut off, again saving batteries.  Incidentally, if you are an \"occasional use\" photographer, rechargable batteries may not be as good as non-rechargeables because rechargeables discharge at a rate of 10 percent per month while they are not in use.  Regular batteries can hold their charge for years.","Great feel and fit, but the lack of a usb port makes transfers painfully slow and the purchase of an extra memory oushes the price up to some better buys."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot G1","amazon_reviews":["This camera model is more than a decade old but still produces great, high-res photos. I recently dropped my original camera and broke it. When I went online to look for a replacement, I discovered that new ones (the same model) cost hundreds of dollars.

I purchased PowerShot G1 in 12/2000($800 & my second camera out of 8 digital by 2009). Still one of the best digital cameras I have owned (built like a tank). The quality of pictures are still the best for a 3.3 M.P.

I bought a G1 used for @300 dollars based upon exhaustive research. 3mp, fold out lcd screen, unlimited manual control(lots of modes +full manual and manual focus), raw format(better and smaller than tiff) attracted me. What really turned out to be great was the battery life(lasts a long long time), remote, picture quality, the screen is fantastic- I don't know how I did without it. With photoshop and an epson printer, why spend hundreds more on a tiny no featured camera with more megapixels than you would ever need? why spend hours downloading pics so you can print only 3x5's or 5x7's. This prints beautiful 8x10's. You don't need more. Movie's with sound too.<br />By this camera and a 256 meg compact flash card. you will not be sorry.","Beyond the fact that this camera has accomplished everything it set out to do, the powershot G1 is just the pinnacle of camera technology bundled into a package that most middle market people can afford.<br />To give you some piece of information that is helpful; stuff you might not hear about elsewhere i'll list a few attributes from the PowerShot G1.<br />1. The little cover which is the plug for the powersuply/usb connector is quite flimsy, but with some care won't break. Just have to watch out for it.<br />2. Get a decent Operating System like Windows 2000 that won't crash every two seconds with the use/development of the pictures on-line. I have a Pentium III 600 with 8mb video card and windows 98 Sec edition, and that thing would not handle the Canon ZoomBrowser Product that came with the camera. However i got windows 2000 loaded with a new 32Mb NVIDIA Video Card, and now the thing is yet to crash... SO smoothe... I forgive it...<br />3. Don't be fooled with the 16Mb FlashCard (Give it to the kids to use as a coaster for their toy tea-pot set, because it has no other use). Go out, budget an extra card (i.e. 128 or 1GB Microdrive) its so much more worth it to get the extra space and keep your setting to LARGE (SUPERFINE QUALITY) because the quality of that print is so superior to its counterpart digital 3+MEGAPIXEL cameras'...<br />The petty downsides are very very nitpicky, and you will find these \"issues\" on 90% of camera's... Some cameras will have a set of features, but lack in others... While others have different features, but lack in others as well... The Powershot G1 has all the features you can ask for. A quick List of Pluses (just to be fair because i talked about the minuses)<br />1. The Optical Zoom is quick and provides VERY high quality shots. (Not to mention that the Additional Lenses you can buy will bring you so close to the action you'll need to buy cheaper seats to get further away from the action) (Sitting at glass level at a hockey game, i can get a photo of a Goalie from head to toe, with about 2 inches in top and bottom of image with the 1.5x lens)...<br />2.The LCD flips out, allows for weird angled camera manipulation, (in a crowd, or under things etc..) You can put the camera anywhere at arms length to take very unique photos. It also closes face-in to prevent scratching between shoots... LCD high quality, and feels really sturdy.<br />3.It has the capability of a HUGE SLR/DIGITAL camera all in a small package. Slightly heavy but Very small for its power. People will see you with this thing, and think you have some 80 dollar camera, when it really has capabilities beyond the intermediate camera enthusiast.<br />4.Interface/Menus are easy to work with.<br />5. Taking a picture, loading it to the on-line software, touching up, and presenting (email/website) takes LITERALLY less than a minute. (provied you are near your computer)...<br />6. Expandability is amazing. It is FLASH 1 AND 2 compatible (if you don't know what that is; check it out because that is an important part of a digicam)... (very good quality) this means its compatible with IBM's Microdrives, and Normal Flash Cards...<br />7. Litium Rechargable bateries are absolutly amazing. I have a 128mb, 192mb, and 64mb FC card, along with the provided 16Mb card, and i filled them all up at a bruins game (about 200 pics), and the batery icon just began to show some degredation.  The only reason you might need an extra battery is if you are on lengthy vacations AWAY from powersources... this also leaves room for improvement, you can get stuff like the \"car outlet\" reacharge station (which charges two at a time) or use the provided \"regular power source\" to recharge them...<br />8. I could go on... but email me for about question you have...<br />Overall, i'm very happy with the camera. I've had it for 6 months, and have never been disatisfied. I might add that to get the highest quality from the photos, (if you print your own) make sure you understand about DPI. I tried printing some of my shots (and was somewhat disapointed) but found out that i had set my dpi to 72 on the images i had... When i set it over 300dpi, i was absolutly amazed! And you will be too.<br />_____<br />I've added this part, because it has been a year since i wrote this original review.<br />Note only this change:<br />There are two newer version of this camera out (As you probably know): The Powershot G2, and G3. If i were in the market today for a Digital Camera, (after seeing, and reading what i have) i would try to find a deal for a G1, or G2. The Newer versions (G2, and G3) don't have enough \"extra\" or \"more\" or \"additions\" to warrant the extra cost. New versions should only drive the old versions price down. I'd say the G1 would be a steal at 400-500 bucks. See if you can find a NEW G1, and make sure its a reliable source, and i'll tell you, you can't go wrong. :)","I have owned this camera for over a year and have shot lots of images. I really like the image quality and flexibility of use.Unfortunately the on/off camera mode switch is prone to turning on when stored in a bag or pocket. Also when the camera is turned on if you are not careful you can change from Auto to another mode without realizing it. Otherwise a fine product.","I have owned this camera for over a year and have shot lots of images.

This camera has many factory configured settings that will enable even the beginning photographer to take exceptionally clean images. Also, you can choose from many aperture and speed settings should you want to set these manually (highly recommended). There is also a manual focus capability. I recommend this camera for beginners that want to learn photography and then be able to take the camera along when they move on to the intermediate level. There are many third-party accessories (lenses, adapters, filters) available for this camera. For instance, using macro lenses and a couple of adapters on my G1 I am able to capture all of the color slide pictures and print negatives in my teaching collection. I have been able to transfer my slide teaching presentations to PowerPoint presentations.<br />The G1 is eay to use, very reliable, and you don't need to be a rocket scientist to learn how to use it.

It's simple enough to use for those who need point-and-shoot functionality while allowing for more advanced photographers to play with speed, aperature, white balance, exposure, etc. to achieve the desired effect.  One of the greatest features of this camera is the battery life.  I'm reading reviews of other 3MP cameras and am blown away that they only offer 1-3 HOURS of battery life.

The camera needed to serve two purposes, 1)substitute for a bulky SLR while traveling while providing high quality images; 2) be dependable and easy to carry.  The G1 has been an excellent companion.  I have actually used it to photograph construction drawings.  The printed images were amazingly clear and the detail superb, even when printing at 8x10 - note even the small print on the drawings was perfectly clear.<br />I was initially reluctant to go digital, and am now truly impressed. As a compliment to a 35mm camera you can't go wrong with the G1, for the price.","This purchase was my first digital camera. I waited until now because I wanted a camera with good resolution at an affordable price. This is truely an excellent camera. When used properly, it takes fantastic photos. The battery goes forever. The addition of 64/120 MB cards allowed me to take tons of photos. Why 4 stars? (1) The resolution on the 30 sec video could be better. (2) In low light situations (camera on auto), if you turn the flash off, photos mostly blurr(not always). You get a \"shaky camera\" icon and even if the camera is on a tripod, photos are sometimes blurred. This has caused me to miss some great shots.","I bought my G1 5 monts ago and have found it to be an excellent overall performer.  The lens is very sharp and I have found the spot meter to be particularly useful in general shooting.  There are some drawbacks -- shutter delay is present and is sometimes a problem in shooting candid photos.  Also, I found it very difficult to get good printed results until I purchased a Canon S800 printer.  The Canon printer provided excellent printed results.  Even though film may have higher resolution in theory, my prints from the Canon were as sharp or sharper than anything I've seen from prints from the local drugstore.","Okay I'm not a pro, or semi pro or anything like that! I bought the G1 primarily as a point and shoot hoping that I'd find the time to use its advanced functions. I've owned other digital cameras and this blows them away. First off... The LCD swivel rocks. Batter life??? OH BOY literally hundreds of pictures on a single charge of the included cam-corder battery. Plus it supports Compact Flash type II so you can use a MicroDrive if neeeded for unlimited storage possibilities.<br />If you decide on the G1 (or the G2 for that matter), I suggest you visit...and purchase the lensmate adapter and UV filter to protect your lens. It makes the camera a bit larger but will protect your investment.<br />My setup:<br />Canon G1<br />IBM 340 MB Micro Drive<br />Lensmate Adapter with UV and Macro Lens<br />Extra Battery<br />Speedlight 420 Flash<br />I haven't found any real \"cons\" with the G1. Nothing is perfect.. here's my list:<br />*recording AVI movies runs battery down pretty quickly<br />*Don't use the camera in freezing conditions.. it won't work<br />*It would be nice to have a better grip (G2 fixes this)<br />Also, I'm not certain that I like the Speedlite 420 with the G1.. I'm no expert and have to work a bit more with the cam/flash combo but my pictures are normally over saturated when using the bounce flash. I'm  guessing it's just because I haven't got the experience.<br />This is a great camera.","I just bought this camera last night and had it down in just a short time. Except for a feature or two that I would use, like bulb setting, the picture quality is magnificent. I did a few test shots at the highest resolution setting & had them printed at a lab on conventional color paper. At 11x17 the photos look like they came off a 6x7 neg. 35mm can't even compete as far as I am concerned....Canon, keep it going.","I have had my G1 for about 6 months now and everyone who has seen images from this camera are amazed.  I purchased this camera because it is substantial, well-designed, intuitive and produces outstanding image quality.  Many may find the camera too heavy, but I find many competitors flimsy and cheap.  That is disconcerting given the investment one makes in these gadgets.  I recommend everyone pick up the camera at your local retailer (...) to be certain its size and weight are suitable.<br />The LCD flip screen is a big plus with crystal clear resolution and the ability to protect the screen while in the case or in use.<br />The Canon G1 has only three problems.  First, in extremely sunny settings I find the background can be quite overexposed (burned out).  Second, I noticed a pixel in the periphery is intermittently bright green suggesting this portion of the CCD is not functioning.  Not a big deal, but I am inquiring with Canon about resolving this issue.  Third, the Canon G2 came out shortly after my purchase.  Oh well!!!<br />I think it would be unlikely one will be unhappy with the purchase as long as it fits within your budget.<br />Good Luck","A professional feel and grade, many features. Some white<br />background problems, but SHARP picture and solid feel make this<br />camera well worth the money.","I love my G1! It's everything you'll ever need.<br />The biggest advantage to G1 is that you can get additional IBM microdrive (340mb or 1gig) and NEVER take it out. I have 340mb and my camer always shows space available for 999 more pictures at a medium resolution, medium size. It just cannot show a bigger number. I brought home about 600 pictures from Disney, never had to change the card.<br />The quality is just amazing! My Disney pictures turned out to be postcards - bright and full of color. I sent the files for print and print turned out to be better than from a regular camera.<br />Another feature I love: the swivel screen. I take movies of myself and send them overseas to my friends. Or I take movies of falling stars and fireworks.<br />There are things that I would change though:<br />- Movies stop recording after 30 sec, even though I have plenty of space left.<br />- It charges VERY slow.<br />In short, this is the best digital camera on the market. Yes, Nikon is good, but it doesn't support Microdrive, what good is the camera if you constantly have to change cards?<br />I love my G1!!! :)","I am very pleased with this Digicam.<br />The overall results are stunning and it is<br />easy to use. The good manual took a couple of days<br />to read & I am now carrying the camera everywhere I go.<br />I purchased a 128 mega Viking memory card and a<br />second battery. The memory card is a must. The 2nd<br />battery is only used now & again & is a luxury<br />which I could have done without. However its a nice<br />feeling to carry a charged spare.<br />Don't buy a Canon battery there are cheaper ones out<br />there.<br />I  did an online survey before I purchased & I am<br />happy that I purchased a solid Camera.<br />The movie feature (30 seconds AVI file is a nice<br />gimmick but not good enough quality to use other than<br />for a laugh.<br />The auto focus is sometimes a little touchy.<br />Its worth double checking your frames before<br />moving on.<br />The only serious problem is the Canon ZoomBrowser<br />software..It is cumbersome & not very well made.<br />It seems to clash with my Windows 98 on my laptop<br />& doesn't get on with my Desktop Windows 2000 either.<br />Perhaps Canon have a FIX available?<br />However I have used the Photoshop included & sent some<br />photos (approx 1.5 mb) to the local printing house & am<br />very pleased with the 8x6 prints. No one can tell that they<br />are from a digital source!!<br /> END","After struggling to like my previous 1 megapixel Kodak D215 for a year, I spent some bucks for a real camera: the Canon G1.  The Kodak was point-and-shoot, but the low resolution made \"fuzz-balls\" of trees and needed batteries every 20-30 shots.  The G1 makes it child's play to take great clear photos.<br />While not the simplest appearing camera, it is extremely flexible and takes photos rivaling a good 35mm SLR.  If left in \"auto mode\", it takes great shots with virtually no \"start-up\" issues. The G1's ease of use facilitates exploration of the manual and semi-automatic features which can help open the eyes of those who have avoided pro type photography, thinking it was far too technical.<br /><br />That's the beauty of going digital.  After the initial purchase, it's cheap to play and explore the realm of photography since the cost of experimenting, developing, modifying the photos is nil--here I'm considering my own time to be nil.<br />You will want to invest a padded case and in larger Compact Flash units ASAP, but CF costs have come down dramatically in the last few months.  I recommend the 128 meg sizes (. . .)<br />The plusses of this particular camera are its simplicity for beginners, full range of features, long battery life, and high build quality of the body, lens, and electronics.  I've banged it around mountain trails and taken well over 100 shots in two days. The evening between, I used the the G1's LCD to review and edit-out pics I didn't like--without re-charging or using-up the full battery charge.<br />I've had the thing for six months and have had excellent results with photos capturing close-ups of bugs on flowers, over-the-head shots at a junior high commencement (using the swiveling LCD), family portraits using the cool included remote, and gorgeous landscapes in Yosemite.  High quality prints using my PC and HP printer are as good as 35mm at 8x10 size and would make passable poster size prints as well.<br />The biggest issues I've needed to deal with probably relate more to my expertise than the camera's fault, like over-exposure in very high contrast conditions: for example, faces or bodies being half-sunlit.  So, I do still need to overcome periodic \"pilot error\", and I've had only marginal success with the camera's sound and video modes.<br />The camera is even \"upgradable\", as I have downloaded and re-configured its operating system (BIOS) from Canon's web-site, so I'm not stuck with last year's bugs--although I'm still not sure what the upgrade fixed since I'd never noticed operational problems.<br />As far as the included Canon software, I think it's quirky and cumbersome, but I don't consider this to be a fault of the camera. The USB-camera connection is recognized by Windows and I prefer to take my photos straight to Photoshop or Paintshop Pro for manipulation or printing rather than using Canon's Zoom Browser.  Since I have a variety of CF modules, I usually use an external Sandisk USB-Compact Flash reader (about $20) rather than keeping the camera plugged-in for downloading.<br />I'm looking forward to a long relationship with this camera.<br />Note that the G1 has been upstaged by a slightly bulkier G2, but the on-line prices for the older model make it an exceptional buy.","after shopping for a few months i found this camera to be THE best deal for money and quality.. i checked epinions and read zillions of reviews.. they all agree with me.. the powershot g1 is an amazing camera.. fully auto for the beginner, and fully manual for the well experienced photographer.. i love this camera!","This is a great camera BUT Canon just came out with their latest camera the PowerShot G2 which has many improvements over the G1 and costs only 100.00 more. (899.00)<br />Go to powershot.com for more information.","I bought this camera 1 month ago. A fantastic buy. This camera shoots fantastic pictures, is very easy to use, has impressive features. I think it's the best camera you can buy.","When I researched for cameras, I read some reviews on the G1 and was completely blown out of the water when I finally got it. It did so much more than what I thought it would do. Purchased the camera from PC4Nothing for $625.00 new. I upgraded to a 128meg flash card and when set at 640 x 480 resolution, the card will hold over 1000 pictures. The most impressive part of the camera was the cameras' ability to create 180+ degree pictures. After completely remodeling my kitchen, I stood at one side and took about 15 picturs in an arc and \"Stiched\" them together with the provided software. It's too cool and easy to use. The software is also easy to use. Overall, probably the best image resolution and options for the money. I really like it and have not had any problems with it at all.","I was surprised to read not one, but two reviews talking about snowflakes on the LCD Viewfinder and horizontal lines! I have had no such problems with my G1 and the LCD Viewfinder shows quite proper images before the shot is taken. I've always found it quite useful.<br />I did quite an extensive research before I finally bought the G1 and never in any of the online reviews of the G1 did I hear of this defect. Maybe the people with this problem should  contact Canon and find out if the defect is with the particular pieces.","This is the best camera EVER!!!  I was up and using it within 1 hour and its general use is very easy.  It has many advance features which I am still playing with.<br />I bought this mainly to take pictures of my 3 month old daughter and the few pictures I took so far came out great.  People wanted to know where I \"had them done\".  Pictures printed out crystal clear on my HP Inkjet printer with the Kodak paper.<br />Its well worth the money!  BUY IT TODAY!","I just bought the camera and whenever i saw what's on the LCD, I remember one of the reviews here about \"snow flakes\" and lines on the LCD.  I am having exactly the same problem. But the captured images are displayed fine on it.<br />I used Kodak DC280 and a SONY digital camcorder before, so i have an idea about what the LCD should look like.  I will try to contact Canon to find what the problem is.","My first digital camera has been excellent but people reading reviews want to know about limitations. 1. Flash is pretty poor- certainly not on par with the rest of the camera.  I need to try the speed lite (nice that you can do that). 2. Limited accessories.  I would like to mount the camera to other devices but have found this almost impossible. 3. Slow on the draw due to the need to have the lens protrude and retract. These quibbles are pretty minor.  For the price, this is a great device.  I would give it 4.5 stars if that were an option.","All the power of my old Nikon SLR, PLUS the darkroom now travels in a brief case.  I am getting the best, most consistent pics in 20 years.  It takes time to get true professional results with this camera, but its the user that has to step up, not the camera. Overexposed flash pics on auto are simple to fix on the exposure menu.  Problem has been reported, but really not much of a problem.  Software setup with Photoshop or equivalent and good printer a must.  Clear, detailed, natural-looking images with sufficient depth to allow lots of manipulation afterwards.","I sat on the digital fence for a long time, finally I jumped and bought the Canon G1. The quality is amazing , downloading of the pictures is a breeze. I soon moved from the AUTO setting to more advanced, even manual shots.The remote works great (once you get the battery the right way up). I thought that the movie mode was a gimmick until I tried it, now I send a lot of AVIs to my family around the world . It's not stunning but it's very passable.  I know people reading reviews want to know any downsides to the products so here's mine. 1) The camera for its size is a little on the heavy side 2) It takes a while to power up, don't expect to grab point and shoot. The Lens has to come out and whir a bit before that can happen. It all takes 4-5 seconds, an eternity if what you want to  shoot moves away. 3) The 16Mb card is inadequate, I got an extra 32Mb and the 48Mb total seems OK for my needs.<br />Overall I'm more than happy.","I researched digital cameras for about 6 months before deciding on this one.  I have a bit of experience with photography, so I wanted one that had a lot of flexibility.  Eventually, the decision came down to this camera and the Nikon CoolPix 990.  I decided on the Canon because I prefered its traditional design over the Nikon's weird swivel thing.  Also the canon uses Compact Flash, which is cheaper than SmartMedia.<br />If you get this camera, buy a big memory card like one of the Viking 256MB CF cards.  You'll like the high resolution images it takes, but they eat up memory like crazy.<br />Oh, another thing: this camera works with Linux!  Actually, that's only half-true.  You can use Gphoto...to download images, but you need the RS-232 serial cable ...  The smart thing to do, however, is to buy a USB Compact Flash reader, like the SanDisk ImageMate.<br />All-in-all, I couldn't be happier with this camera, and I don't think I'd be as happy with any other camera out there right now.","I bought this camera recently along with a 340MB microdrive. Quality of the photos exceeded my expectations . Performance wise this camera is very good. The battery seems to last forever - I took several hundred pics over a three day period and did not need to recharge. Software works well. Downloads to PC were very easy as was the use of the Canon zoom browser.<br />The Canon people need to re-think the design though. The camera looks and feels clunky. On-off switch is inconvenient as is the lens cap. At this price Canon should aslo consider providing a camera case.","I have had the G1 for 6 months now. Like most of the reviewers, I have been extremely pleased with the camera. The pictures are incredibly sharp. The printout using HP Photosmart printer on photographic papers are incredible -- much better than what I can get from a film camera at Wolf Camera.<br />But instead of just adding more raving comments that you don't need, I like to share some of my experiences with it.<br />(1)  Like one of the previous reviewer had said, the color saturation is not perfect. I don't know whether this is a problem unique to the G1, or it is a problem for all digicams. I recommend using high saturation setting instead of the default neutral setting. This helps a little, but the pictures are still under saturated. However, correcting this problem is easy with any of the softwares.<br />(2)  While the default setting at ISO 50 is great for outdoor shooting during the day, it is not good for indoor shooting even during the day, or under artificial lighting. The on camera flash is simply not adequate. The best solution is often to set the ISO at 400, but the pictures will be VERY noisy. The median filter by Photoshop will not be of much help in denoising. However, some of the newer wavelet based denoising schemes work quite well.<br />(3)  Don't overlook the manual setting option. I found it to be the best way to shoot night scenes or in low lighting situations. Set the ISO to 200 or 400, and experiment. Using the flash outdoor at night will give you a very blue tone. It can be nice but it is not realistic.<br />(4)  The battery life is one of the strongest reasons to buy the G1. However, don't automatically assume you can get 700-800 pictures on a single charge. You won't! My experiements suggest that you get about 120-150 pictures if you use the LCD AND you use the flash for about 40% of your shots. Also, when the warning of low battery comes, the battery is gone within 3-5 shots.<br />(5)  I had trouble getting the camera to work in cold weather. I use the 340 MB Microdrive. But after I warmed the camera using my hand for a couple of minutes it works properly.<br />(6)  One of the most troubling problem with G1 is the optical distortion of the pictures. If you shoot wide angle you will see rather pronounced distortions at the two upper corners. Vertical lines of a far away building will appear tilted. I haven seen distortions this bad in cheap lens for 35mm cameras, but never in a decent lens. The problem disappears as one increases the focal length. This means the photostitching for wide angle shots is not a good idea. If you do plan to stitch photos, make sure you shoot them using medium to long focal length.<br />(7)  The remote control in my package doesn't work. I don't really care about it, but you may want to  make sure it works.<br />Despite of these minor problems I love the G1.","Moved from my Nikon SLR to this camera as my primary camera.  It is a great camera for someone who knows something about photography and wants the flexibility of total manual controls.  It is designed for photographers, not camcorder owners stepping into digital photography.  Someone who wants a digital snapshot camera will be fine with this camera as well, but probably happier with the simplicity of a Sony or lower end Canon.<br />Positive:<br />Photo quality: Great at high resolution and more than sufficient for snap shots in medium quality.<br />Lens: Good, reasonably fast zoom lens.  Too bad Canon hasn't gone for a more SLR variable lens approach.<br />Display: LCD screen rotation is very practical for group shots, or discrete people photos.  Great to be able to preview shot on display, delete when unsatisfactory...what a change from long processing times.<br />Software / downloading: Good software, includes Photoshop LE (!), quick USB, good online support.<br />Operation: Excellent, SLR-like feel with all expected features, plus new ones made possible by digital format.  SLR user will not feel feature deprived.<br />Improvements:<br />Memory: 16MB (included) is too small, but I have found an additional 32MB card is just about right for all but the longest time periods away from a computer.  Multiple format flexibility is a nice touch.<br />No carry case / durability: Maybe its just me, but I don't trust the durability of this versus my Nikon SLR, I would encourage buying a case of some kind.  I would really like to see an inexpensive underwater housing like one of the Sony digital cameras have.","I've owned this camera for a few months now.  Instead of taking the 35mm to Ireland, this camera was my choice.<br />The picture quality is terrific, battery life is unbelievable.<br />I'd buy it all over again. As always I early adopt, but even better value now.  The video snippets are super also.","I received my G1 two days ago, made several sample prints on my Epson 870 yesterday, and still can't recover from the shock. The quality is unbelievable, I haven't had better pictures in my life, though I am close to 50 and have been a photography amateur since I was ten. My film photography equipment contains two outfits: 35mm Nikon N70 and medium Mamiya Universal. Neither gives me the sharpness or tonal richness of the G1. I am not in any way related to Canon and I believe that other digital cameras of the same class would impress me in a similar way. It just happens that my first digital camera is this. And impressed I am.","My experience with the G1 has been positive except for flash metering:  Superb lens and image quality; splendid battery longevity with charger included; good creative control; and RAW image option for large, super-fine images. However, when using fill-flash the camera consistently overexposes 1 to 2 stops. To compensate, I have to manually set the flash exposure to underexpose by 1-2 stops. I find this overexposure occurs when using both the built in flash and my (highly recommended) shoe-mounted Canon Speedlight 380EX. Canon's Web site has new firmware that Canon claims fixes flash-related issues, but even after installing the new firmware, the flash exposure was inaccurate for me. Hopefully the good folks at Canon will fix this problem with a future firmware release.","I recently bought a G1 for my trips to Europe and China.  I looked at the G1, Nikon 950 and Olympus 3020.  This was by far the best because of all the features.  I particularly like the LCD screen as it rotates to allow you to take pictures at different angles.  The only two things I dislike are the hand-grip which is non-existent and the cheap plastic piece that covers the charging bay.  If you want a digital camera, then this is the one to get.","I took a long time deciding to purchase a digital camera, and finally bought my Canon G1 in Anguilla (duty-free). The pictures I took on the island were magnificant, and brought many raves and inquiries on our extended family web-site (MyFamiy.com). Based on that experience, I left my trusty old Canon Rebel 35mm behind for a recent trip to Buenos Aires, and loved it. I carried the G1 slung over my shoulder and tucked into my sports jacket pocket for easy access when I needed it spontaneously. Example: A colorful Gypsy woman and child was begging along a street, and for pocket change I got a great shot of them.<br />I especially want to relate two instances where I found the \"flipping\" LCD invaluable.  I wanted to take a picture looking down through a beautiful marble spiral staircase, to get the \"nautilus\" effect. With a standard camera I would have had to risk my life to stretch out over the ten-story space for the shot, or just hold the camera out over the space and hope for the best. With the G1's LCD, I simply flipped out the LCD and adjusted it to my direction while holding the camera out over the space, focused and shot a perfect picture.<br />The second instance was in a rather crowded building where I wanted to shoot a muraled dome overhead.  Rather than crane my neck upward while framing and shooting, I simply held the camera at waist level pointing upwards, with the LCD this time flipped around to the front of the camera so I was actually looking downward to shoot an overhead picture.  Worked perfectly. Great camera!!","I've had my G1 for about two months now. It's a fine instrument. I'm a semi-pro photog. It's changed my shooting habits, my working habits, and the way I look at photography. It has resulted in some very interesting new information-delivery concepts.  My gripe is with the software. I'm a Mac user, so I expected rather crude interfaces ported from the Windows world. No big problem. And the Canon software for downloading, manipulating, viewing, etc. the images is quite powerful, but the user interface is fairly badly flawed, which is a shame. With such a fine camera, and such basically powerful software (the PhotoStitch and SlideShow functions are particularly nice), it's a shame that Canon couldn't see its way to smooth out the interface and make it more intuitive.  Some of the ways in which the software could easily be improved would be evident to a six-year-old. Others are a bit more subtle, but still readily evident.  The worst mis-function (besides memory crashes--and virtually no info about how to prevent them in the wooden documentation) is in setting up the camera for remote capture (ie, the camera is being controlled remotely by my PowerBook G3 courtesy of a connecting cable). It's easier to find the key to world peace than to figure out how to get this working first time around. If you write your own instructions, you can then do it in the future; but don't expect it to be explained clearly in the manual, or to be (gasp!) Macintosh-style intuitive.  We can hope for smoother versions of the proprietary software in the future, but well-designed, smooth-operating software is such a rarity now that I won't hold my breath. Still, it'd be great to have programs that match the camera in elegance, design, ease of use and just plain fun.","I am not a photography pro, but after lots of research and buying the wrong camera a few times, The G1 was recommended by friends that do photography for a living. It really is easy to use and the battery lasts as long as you need it (for me anyway).  I bought a spare anyway.  Haven't needed to use it yet.  I've shot 60+ shots on a charge without running out of power An added flash is a necessity.  The built in flash is good for only 14 feet or so.","After a lot of searching and researching I finally decided to get the G1.  What an outstanding camera!  As a first-time digital camera user I knew I was buying more camera than I needed.  Despite all of its features, it has been easy to use and learn.  The camera comes with everything you need to get started and setup is easy.  Picture quality is unbelievable!  Even the short movies capture great detail.  Make sure you buy an extra CompactFlash card with plenty of memory.<br />This camera provides the right combination of features with its rechargeable batteris, which last a long time, to its size; this camera has it all.  You can also buy other Canon flashes and lenses which further its capability.<br />Great camera - worth the money!!","While I like this camera, one shortcoming any serious user should be aware of - All shutter speeds above 1/500 only work with  f8.0 - So, if it's a cloudy day and you're shooting sports,  an exposure of 1/800s at f2.8 won't work.<br />This makes the Shutter Preferred and Aperture Preferred modes of limited value. If you're not going to be shooting on AUTO, you might want to look at another camera.","The G1 is an excellent point and shoot camera, but failed to perform well with an external flash.  I tried two cameras and returned both because of this failure.  The instructions (and Canon) imply that manual exposure with manual flash power should behave as well as with a film camera - it does not do this.  Exposure is hard to set, unpredictable and several stops overexposed.","I do not want to repeat all the praises of this great camera. I'd like to point out that the exact focusing may be a problem. The depth of field of these very short focal length lenses is very deep. I miss the rectangular marker for metering (when I do it and not in auto mode - the autofocus is so sophisticated you almost never need the override it).<br />Not Canon's fault is the fact that many older studio strobes can not be fired from the G1. The high voltage trigger circuit may even damage the camera. Speedorton's 64V did not do any harm to mine but I can not use them together. The manual ought to warn against this.<br />I love the G1 and use it almost every day...besides an S100 that is in my pocket :-)","Hi just purchased this camera on the weekend.....and all I got say is its \"amazing.\" Myself, I am not a proffesional photographer, but am hevily into web design. Basically to sum it up 1)Excellent Images (can't stress that enough) 2)Battery life is excellent 3)Nice metal casing and feel to it 4)Features for days 4)Nightmode is extreamly impressive 5) Well worth the money","I normally use a Nikon Coolpix 990, but I recently had a chance to try this Canon for a few days.<br />It's a very different machine to handle. I think it's actually smaller than the Nikon, but the Nikon falls more easily into my hands.<br />The screen on the Nikon is fixed on the camera body, but the lens swivels around the body. The screen on the Canon can be swivelled in any direction. So the Canon's would appear to be more flexible, yet I found that I was constantly fiddling with the screen to get it to an angle that I liked. That may just be a matter of familiarity.<br />The screen is very bright and shows up much better in sunlight than the Nikon's. But I think the Nikon's is better quality.<br />They are both bristling with manual controls that make them exceptionaly flexible. They could be dauntingly complicated for the novice. The Canon has the advantage of a hot shoe in case you want to use an external flashgun. Quite a big advantage since the on camera flash on both is nothing special. You will probably want to be able to get the same high quality results with flash as in natural light - if you buy the Nikon, you will have to buy their expensive external flash and the adapter.<br />Results-wise, in natural light, I can't really say one is better than the other. They are both superb.","I waited 6 months for a camera to come on the market that met all my requirements. After lots of research and reading the professional reviews, I purchased this camera, and a 340MB Microdrive.<br />Since January, I have taken over 2,000 pictures in all lighting conditions, and the camera has exceeded my expectations<br />The major features I considered important for purchase: * 3 megapixel * Long battery life * rechargeable battery with charger included * Microdrive capable * video with sound * spot metering * 3x optical zoom (the 4x digital zoom is useless) * built-in flash * fast focusing and small time interval between shots<br />Great features that go beyond my initial requirements: * swiveling lcd panel * video output to watch a slide show from the camera * simulated click sound when picture is taken * software bundle (powerful and easy to use) * stitch mode to create panoramic pictures (works great) * remote control (great for playback in slide show mode)<br />The only minor flaw in picture quality is that bright white light appears with purple overtones.<br />I also recommend fototime.com for uploading unlimited photos.<br />Warning about Microdrive: A friend has the same camera model with the Microdrive.  At 7,000ft elevation, the Microdrive did not work for him.<br />The same friend purchased the 1.5x zoom lens. He says the difference is minimal, so the hassle of attaching the lens outweighs its benefit.","I am not a \"Pro\" photograher in fact I never used any camera more complicated than a point & shoot Fuji film camera. Back In 97 I got my first digital camera a Kodak DC50. The camera was pretty good back in 97 but in October 2000 when I started to really check out what was new in digital I could see it was way past due that I purchase a new digital camera. So I researched for about a month comparing Images & features then decided to purchase the G1. After having the G1 for four months I can say I truly am happy with my camera. The G1 has a very sharp lens And with a external flash you can do beautiful portraits. The G1 has super low light capabilities. And lots of creative control, I most allways shoot raw in manual mode except for when I need that quick one, I use auto mode for the \"snapshot\". The battery is one big plus of the G1 it really seems like it goes on forever, unlike the other cameras that eat up AA batterys like candy. All in all there has been no disappointment with the G1 for me. ... ...","I recently purchased the Canon Powershot G1, WOW!!! This is a great camera; my wife was spending all kinds of money on film every week. We looked for a digital camera and none really impressed us till we ran across the G1. It really is a great camera. Thanks for making a great product Canon.","The first one I got \"didn't communicate properly with the battery\". I exchanged it.  The second one wouldn't focus in the macro mode. Exchanged it.  The third one has lines running through the LCD and still doesn't want to focus in macro mode.  I have considered switching to another make/model, but I will not give up on the G1 yet!  I love this camera, eventually I will get one that works properly.","I looked and looked for a digital that offerred SLR-like functionality, but without the price overhead of a true digital SLR.  My first direction was the Kodak 4800 - but after seeing the G1 demoed, I was sold.  Plenty of preset modes, durable, long battery, good lens, plenty of programmability, and nothing beats the panoramic stitch assist and short motion video features.  I originally shopped  around at photo stores, and everybody was sold out - that helped convince me too.  In the end I ordered it from Amazon and got it quicker than any dealer could come close to.","Based on all the very good reviews, I went for this camera as my first plunge into the digital photo realm. Aside from some minor ergonomic issues with the shape of the camera, I've been pleased. Image quality is excellent. My only problem so far - getting one that works. The first one I received was inoperative right out of the box. The replacement for that one died after five weeks and is now at Canon for repair. I haven't seen other problems with reliability mentioned anywhere so perhaps my troubles are rare (I hope).","I have been into digital photography for about 3 years, and have owned an Apple Quicktake 200 (lame), Nikon Coolpix 950 (decent), Nikon Coolpix 990 (almost right; read my review), and now the G1. I have it set up with the 340 MB IBM microdrive, as well as the Canon 420EX Speelite. This combination, I feel, is about as good as you can get without getting to the [price] range (Canon D30). Here are some things you may not see in the other reviews:<br />* The camera, once it powers on after about 5 seconds, is very very quick shooting. You almost can't want to shoot faster than it will allow.<br />* Focus can, however, slow you down a bit, especially in dark setting (despite focus-assist light), and in low-contrast settings. I am a dentist (couldn't you tell by the name?!), and the camera does have issues with intraoral focusing.<br />* Playback of images is very fast, especially when you use the RAW format. You can flip through about 2/second. If you can, buy a BIG memory card. I have the 340 MB Microdrive, and can store about 200 images in RAW mode. This mode is important. It is the equivalent of a TIFF file, but only takes about 2 megs/image, instead of 9 Megs with the Coolpix 990. Also, shot-to-shot in TIFF mode on the 990 is almost 10 seconds; on the G1, shot-to-shot in RAW is about 1 second. Also, in RAW mode, you can alter brightness/contrast/color saturation losslessly.<br />* Flash photography is a complete joy to do with this camera. The 420EX is a spectacular flash, there is tons of power, no red eye, and the E-TTL system makes even bounce and swivel photography a complete breeze. You can even over/underexpose the flash, and wirelessly control multiple flashes. Just totally unparalleled.  Nikon and Olympus just can't touch this. 990 doesn't even have a hot shoe...<br />* The battery is on steroids; just never wants to run out (realistically ~400-500 shots 'til reload). With the Coolpix 990, you have to buy batteries and a charger. Koodos to Canon for adding this value to the G1.<br />* The layout of the controls is such that just about every button is within easy reach of my fingers. Excellent.<br />* Optional adapter (... LA-DC58) screws into the front, and allows you to use standard 58 mm lenses and ring lights to further expand your creativity.<br />* Camera is fairly hefty, and builty like a tank. This sure isn't going to break in your hands...<br />* Setting the ISO to 50 (Nikon can't do this) gives just absolutely fantastic photos with very minimal noise, even in the dead of night (Nikon had MUCH more noise).<br />Negative stuff (hey, it can't be perfect!):<br />* There is no Program Shift!!!  HOW could they do this?!?!  This actually is a bummer, and the standard Program mode always seems to favor wide open F-stops; stick to aperture-priority.  990 has this....<br />* You cannot have multiple folders to store images to. This is a pain, since I can store about 200 images between downloads, and I never want to have my patient photos mixed up. 990 has this feature, but I consider it a minor inconvenience.<br />In conclusion, the unique highs of this camera include the image quality (ISO 50), awesome flash capabilities, IBM Microdrive support, RAW image mode, great battery, and lots of great accessories. The negatives include suspect night/low contrast focusing and no program  shift. I've used most 3 megapixel cameras, and I think this is the gem of the lot.","Pictures are crystal clear, but colors are below acceptable level. All the three of us digicam enthusiasts tried to figure out, all to no avail, why a top-line Canon, one of the best cameras in traditional photography, produce such a poor color. In comparison, Kodak 4800, Nikon 880 and even Kodak 3400 have a much better color saturation.<br />Two other things I don't like the camera apply to most of other digicams: the battery and the memory card.  These lithium batteries are expensive and not widely available, especially for tourists who travel to far and distant places where choices of batteries and the time to recharge are usually limited.  To me, AA batteries are the most convenient, widely available, least expensive and therefore are the best choice.  Besides, they seem to last just as long as their lithium counterparts.<br />I put my pictures in the computer's albums and burn them on CDs to share with friends and family.  Therefore, I always use the highest resolution with the lowest compression rate.  An 8 or 16 MB memory card is simply a joke, especially when you go on a long trip. At this time of digicam development, the minimum size should be 32 MB.","I've had this camera for a couple months now, and have taken a couple hundred photos so far. I can totally agree with other reviews here that this is an excellent camera...<br /> * The \"night portrait mode\" does a great job of popping the flash to fill in the foreground (subjects) while leaving the shutter open for about 1/2sec to burn in the background. This feature produces really good results in parties and other darker rooms.<br /> * The long-exposure manual modes do a really nice job of uniformly exposing the shot, completely without any artifacts or other noise from the CCD.<br />* This camera, with a little work, can be made to work with Linux. ... ... ... that explains the sprocedure. Being a Linux user myself, this was very important to me.","You can't go wrong with this camera.  I love it.  The only problem I had was with the LCD sreen.  It had lines going through it when it was in record mode, but I called canon and they said with proof of purchase it was under a warranty for a year (WOW, no that's cool). Trust me you'll definately be satisfied with this camera.","The main things I like about this camera are the 1) 3 mega-pixel resolution. It is a noticable improvement from my old Olympus D-500L, 2) \"point-and-shoot\" shape (though on the large side) still fits in a large shirt pocket, jacket pocket, or small camera bag.  I will be carrying this one with me on vacation.  3) Supports both full auto and manual controls.  In most cases, I shoot in the Auto or Program mode, but I also do like to use the Shutter/Aperture priority and Full Manual modes.  4) Ability to store \"RAW\" (non-compressed images).  In most cases, I prefer to do the \"touch-up\" then store the images in .jpeg (and keep the original \"RAW\" file for archival.) 5) Battery life seems very good, and I like the fact that a rechargeable battery and AC adapter are included in the kit.<br />On the downside, the included 16-meg compact flash card is way to small. It will only hold 5 RAW images or 8 hi-res jpegs.  A 64-meg or greater is recommended.  And as I mentioned earlier, the camera is a little on the big side.","I bought this camera a week and a half ago and I'm very, very impressed. The pictures it takes are outstanding, as is just about everything else about the camera. I purchased this camera after reading a review on Digital Photography Review ([...]) which was very favorable.<br />I wanted a camera I could have complete control of and this is it. It has a full-auto mode along with program AE, shutter priority, aperture priority, and full manual modes. It also provides a bunch of pre-programmed modes for things like portraits and landscapes (I've not made much use of them though).<br />The battery life is excellent. The battery is the same that powers their full blown digital SLR, the EOS-D30, so it has more than enough power for this camera. I haven't come near running out of battery life yet.<br />In addition, the camera supports CompactFlash types I and II and microdrives (muy importante!), has a 3x optical zoom (and a 2x or 4x digital zoom, but I don't use it), and supports an adapter for 58mm filters and additional lens attachments. The LCD flips out and twists making it very easy to position the camera where it needs to go and still see the image.<br />The best feature of the camera, though, is without a doubt the image quality. Colors are excellent and the pictures are crisp and very detailed. The camera supports resolutions of 2048x1536, 1024x768, and 640x480. It can store images in a raw CCD format or in super-fine, fine, or normal JPEG. I use both the high and medium resolutions in super-fine JPEG and consistently get outstanding results. The raw format requires the TWAIN driver or other compatible decoder to convert the raw CCD data into a normal image format (such as TIFF), but this is a small price to pay if you want a totally unaltered image off the CCD.<br />I have a gallery of images taken with the camera at my website, [...] for those interested in seeing what it can do.<br />All in all, wonderful!","I spent a good 2 months shopping for a digital camera before finally deciding on the Powershot G1.  I couldn't be happier with my choice.  While there are two things that bother me about the camera (I will get to them later), the benefits much more than compensate for the nuisances.<br />When I purchased the camera, I bought both a 128 meg viking (~130 photos at full resoloution) compact flash memory card and a 1 GB IBM Microdrive (~1200 photos).  I bought the static memory in addition to the microdrive because I was worried about the increased usage of battery life due to the moving parts of the drive.  However, I was shocked by the length of the battery life in comparison to other digital cameras (even other powershots).  Using the LCD, flash, and the microdrive I can take over 270 shots before running low on battery.  The extensive battery life and number of photos that can be taken on a microdrive are a big plus, especially considering my first gripe: the cover for the USB/Power connectors.  There is a rubber cover over these that connectors that I fear I am going to break every time I take it off.  It is incredibly solid while in place, and then as soon as you push it hard enough it flips out and is only held in by a tiny little rubber plug.  Luckily I don't need to charge or download my photos that often.<br />The second complaint, isn't much of a problem for me, just a comment that I've received.  Friends will use the camera, and say \"That's an absolutely phenomenal camera, it's just a little heavy though\".  I agree, it is a little heavy, but the control I have over the camera and the benefits from its design are worth the extra weight.<br />If you are in the field for a top level digital camera, I would reccomend this with no reservations, compared to the drawbacks of many other digital camera, the Powershot G1 presents unprecedented power and control for all your digital photography needs.","I recently upgraded my digital camera to the G1 (from an older Casio VGA) and I couldn't be happier.<br />It is easy to use and takes excellent pictures for a \"prosumer\" (I've taken over 500 since it arrived).  The user interface will be familiar to Canon film camera users and it seems to offer the right combination of automated and manual features.<br />This camera comes equipped with everything you need: cables, storage, rechargeable, remote control, software, etc.  The only complaint would be the size of the 16MB CompactFlash.  You probably will want a 32MB or bigger device -- but that purchase can wait because the computer interface on this is excellent and uploading is a pleasure.<br />The USB interface and Type 1 and 2 card support are the way to go.  This gives you a lot of future protection and upgrade options.<br />The included software is more than adequate.  ZoomBrowser the camera manager is the best picture organizer I have used.  The TWAIN driver has worked with all my photo and video editors.<br />The battery is incredible -- long life and fast recharge -- can't ask for more.<br />The LCD display is really useful.  There are better displays out there but none more convenient.  The ability to tuck it away saves on battery and cleaning the display.  The 360 degree orientation is great.  I use it in conjunction with the remote control to great effect.","I certainly agree with the other reviewers and their praise for picture quality and total control (when wanted). The only thing I'd like to add is my accolades for two major features:<br />1. Microdrive support The Microdrive removes the restrictions posed by limited in-camera picture storage on CF cards. You have to experience the loss of this restriction to really appreciate how important it is. We just returned from a week-long cruise where we took over 300 full-size pictures and still had a lot of in-camera storage left.<br />2. Amazing battery life Using a camcorder battery to power this camera provides an enormous amount of long-term power. You can leave the LCD on and use a Microdrive without any fears of having the power come up short.<br />These two features put this camera in a class by itself. When you combine them with the other outstanding capabilities, this is clearly the right choice!","After owning two digital cameras each for over a year, and after scouring the web for 3 months for reviews & recommendations for 3+ meg cameras, I finally bought a G1. I could not possibly be happier! Took it on a long vacation at the end 2000 and was consistently amazed at the flexibility, the smart design & functionality, the battery life, the speed to use, AND the image quality. Especially when compared to the Kodak cameras that I've used & owned, this product is a winner. I was pretty picky because I was frustrated with Kodak's lack of manual settings & options - the G1 lacks neither.<br />I brought a film camera on my vacation as well, and was so impressed with the G1 from day 1 that I ended up taking only about 5 shots on film and 200 digital (high resolution, medium size) images. The G1 really is that good - and a joy to use. Take it from a picky photographer.<br />As with other reviewers, I was worried about the hinged/swiveling LCD panel. But now that I've used it, it seems to be extremely well mounted and very solid. It's a high quality display, and I love the flexibility it offers for viewing during the shoot from in front of the camera, next to the camera, behind the camera - and for viewing images after the shoot at unlimited angles.<br />Do not buy this - or any other 3 meg camera - without a large memory card. I bought a 128M card for use in this camera, and even with that you can only store less than 100 images at full resolution & full size (which is plenty, unless you go on long trips without a computer to offload images). Go with at least a 64M card. And do not buy this camera without a case for protection - there seem to be plenty available here at Amazon for a few dollars. Unfortunately, Canon did not include a case with the G1.<br />If you just want a simple point & shoot digital camera, this one would probably be the least economic for you - unless you want to impress your gadget buddies (this definitely will). There are others with fewer features & flexibility. But if you're a pro or a darkroom photographer (I'm the latter) who is looking for quality AND functionality, you'll be extremely happy with the G1. It's worth the higher price.<br />ps: If you're reading this after about September 2001 you should probably check around a little because there will probably be 10 more 3 meg cameras out by then, and some of them may have matched or surpassed the G1 - especially economically.","Caveat: I have used one digital camera prior to this (a Sony Mavica), and this is the first one I own. I have used Canon EOS cameras for many years.<br />The upsides (assuming you have read the specs already):<br />- Very controllable (as opposed to the ELPH, say). I can tweak and manipulate to my heart's content, when I feel the urge.<br />- Solid optics (but see below). F2.0 lens.<br />- Protected LCD (you can leave it turned in towards the body when not in use). (But see below)<br />- Light ENOUGH. This was my one real concern, as I was considering this vs. the ELPH. Was it light enough that I would carry it with me everywhere, or would it suffer the fate of my EOS - a fine camera, sitting at home on the shelf due to bulk and weight? Having carried it around for a while now, I have concluded it is being light enough for me - it does not impede me when backpacking...<br />- Photostich (where you can bring a series of pictures together to make a larger one (e.g., a panorama) is WONDERFUL! I have made a panorama for quicktime virtual reality from my porch, giving the viewer the feel of standing there, turning around at will. Great stuff. The camera works with this, so that you can easily create sufficiently overlapping pictures for the software to work well.<br />- The IBM microdrive compatibility is also wonderful - I have a one GB drive in there for extended trips, and can take about 600 pictures at max resolution and max quality.<br />Downsides:<br />- The rubber cover for the power and USB ports. I would be suprised if it were to survive a whole year. I have no idea what the replacement policy and options are, so you may end up with two naked ports.<br />- The lens cap is separate and there are no threads for a protective filter. That makes me nervous. But if a separate lens cap is the price to pay for good optics, then so be it.<br />- The optical coating is not up to the usual Canon EOS snuff (one gets sun glare to easily). But it is far better than the usual point-and-shoot lenses around.<br />- The LCD can be turned around, flipped, rotated... and protected. The protection provided is a good thing. The mechanical wear and tear of always moving these hinges makes me nervous. But if so, simply leave the LCS open in the back, and you are no worse off than with most other cameras out there.<br />- I have not gotten hold of a protective case yet, and that makes me nervous, too.<br />Summary: Well worth the money.","I'm a new owner of the Canon G1. In spite of all the good reviews from customers about this digital camera, I am quite disappointed by the quality of the LCD.  At least for the G1 I got, the LCD picture quality is quite poor.  There are \"snow flakes\" all over the picture in the display.  Illumination of the LCD is uneven. As well, there are lines running across the LCD screen.  As a result, images in the LCD are not clear or sharp at all.  These problems, however, disappear when a shot is taken and do not affect the quality of the picture taken. But everytime when I use the LCD as the view finder to look around, those problems persist.<br />I'm not sure if I got a defective camera; or is it normal performance for G1.  I'd like to hear that if you have; or for that matter, don't have the same experience with yours.","I agree with the points listed by others reviewing the Canon Powershot G1 camera and I am very happy with the product. I purchased this camera to take advantage of some of its more advanced features and have not been let down (after several weeks, I'm still making discoveries).<br />A couple of additional notes I would like to add for those intending to buy this camera and for existing owners:<br />1) I highly recommend Canon's PSC1000 semi-hard case for the G1. It is a two-piece leather design that provides significant protection for the camera body, as well as making the camera easier to grip for those with large hands.<br />2) I have been pleasantly surprised with the software that Canon supplied with the G1 - the ZoomBrowser software provides a quick, convenient method of viewing large numbers of photographs. This camera also comes with a 'SE' edition of Adobe Photoshop - a rich product that enjoys industry-wide support. Competitors often provide a TWAIN-compatible driver and a simple/cheap photo manipulation program - leaving consumers to purchase adequate software.<br />3) The 16mb card supplied with the camera is really included only to make the camera operable out of the box. In my opinion, this card should have been at least 64mb in size (high quality JPG images are 1.2mb in size). Be prepared to purchase a larger card immediately, or try one of the Microtech harddrives made by IBM, which the G1 supports fully.<br />I've rated the camera 5 stars because I find it to be the digital equivalent to Canon's excellent line of EOS SLR cameras in every respect.","I've already had one digital camera (a Kodak DC290, which was excellent) for a year, but I longed for more manual control and more flexibility, and this camera delivers in spades.  The G1, in fact, has so many features and options that it's a bit overwhelming for people who've operated earlier, more limited digital cameras primarily in point-and-shoot mode.  Apart from shutter and aperture priority, there are night flash, portrait, landscape and movie modes.  There's excellent noise reduction for long exposures and a mode to assist with taking panoramas (plus almost absurdly easy stitching software) to merge the shots on a computer.<br />The camera sets new standards in its price category with its support for IBM Microdrives and the use of a camcorder battery, meaning longer life and lots more pictures possible in a given session.  The swiveling LCD is fantastic and is so bright I use it to compose for almost every shot... again, the longer battery life makes this possible.  The menus are easy to follow and the ergonomics are great -- the camera feels very solid and not like some weirdly designed gadget.  A hot shoe means it's easy to attach a Canon speedlite flash (or some third party flashes) for even greater flexibility, and it's a relief not to have to rely on clumsy brackets to hold a flash.  RAW mode pictures make it possible to tweak pictures for things like white balance in the computer.<br />The picture quality is superb, and the camera is very adaptable to a variety of picture taking settings.  What may cause an issue with novice users is the fact that pictures using auto settings, while OK, can be a bit cool, and in trickier settings on sunny days, end up slightly overexposed.  The built-in flash is also on the finicky side and will require some experimentation to determine optimal range.  It's simple enough to adjust flash strength, exposure or white balance accordingly and have those settings stick, but some folks may not want to bother. There are definitely more manageable cameras for those who primarily want point-and-shoot or those who want very saturated looking pictures right out of the camera (the Kodaks  being best).<br />But by the same token, those who like to tinker will find the pictures possible with the G1 excellent--they compare very favorably to other digicams I evaluated such as the Nikons, Olympuses and Kodaks.  This is a very good camera for people who want to learn more about photography.  After an adjustment period of over a hundred pictures, I find that everything from portraits to landscapes to macro shots to night shots comes out very well.  The software that comes with the camera for downloading and browsing images (Zoombrowser) is well done --I usually avoid installing camera manufacturers' software because of bugs, but this is good stuff.<br />Most notable nits:  a flimsy rubber door that covers the AC port, and a slow bootup time when using the IBM Microdrive.  Otherwise, the camera feels wonderful and the time to take pictures from one shot to another is very fast.<br />Overall, I am very pleased.  Beyond everything I've already said, the fact that I've taken nearly a thousand pictures in just a few weeks is evidence that taking pictures with this camera and making use of all its capabilities is absolutely addictive!","I got this camera with the IBM 1GB microdrive, and I can pretty much forget about film camera.  Seriously. (FYI, I own an EOS-1, and an ELPH)<br />For those who are browsing this reviews probably knows a lot about this camera so I would skip the introduction.  ...<br />In short, this is a very great camera (high res., microdrive compatible and a very, very long battery life) but it does have some minor things that I would like to share with you, by reading this hopefully you will know what you're going to expect when you receive this great camera:<br />1) The plastic rubber side door is very flimsy, so be careful not to break it!<br />2) During the movie mode you cannot zoom in or out, maybe I do not know how to do it but I doubt it.<br />3) The flash light does tend to have a bit over exposure, so adjust accordingly, you might have to experience it to find a correct exposure level for your taste.<br />4) This camera does not come with a camera bag therefore the metal body has to take extra care otherwise you might find your new G1 end with quite a few unwanted scratches.<br />5) Finally, the lens cap: why don't Canon design a built-in lens cover instead of a physical cap?  Sometimes I forgot to remove the lens cap before I turn on the camera and it shows me error message,tell me to restart the start up procedure again.  Quite troublesome I must say.  Hopefully I will get use to it.<br />Overall I am going to give it a solid 5 stars because this camera, although has the above weaknesses, it does have a lot of improvements compare with some top of the line consumer camera like Nikon Coolpix 990, Olympus 3030 etc.  So for the money I spend this is a very well worth camera!","I've had mine for a week now, and I am totally impressed with it.  The G1 combines point and shoot capability with enough (optional) control to satisfy all but the most serious photographers.  Its 3 megapixel images, 3x optical zoom, and lithium battery offer exceptional performance.<br />My only complaint is with the flash, which tends to overexpose shots a tiny bit.  I've found that changing the flash exposure down by -2/3 fixes this (you can change this one time and forget about it).<br />For storage I use a 128 mb viking memory card, plus a 340mb microdrive.  With the camera set to superfine and large images I can shoot hundreds of photos.<br />This camera is perfect for someone who wants high quality photos and is willing to spend the money to get it.  As an alternative take a look at the Kodak DC480 - you'll pay half as much but you won't give up control, a longer optical zoom, and some resolution.  Personally, this ones a keeper for me."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix 2400 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["I found on receiving my camera that I could not download the software on my computer.  The model was not one of the choices to choose from that I bought.  Therefore, I did'nt use my camera for quit sometime.  When the portable printers came out for digital I bought one and started to use my camera.  Unfortunately, the color is not what I expected and it seems to have to much red in it.  Sometimes I also get red eye even when the eye reduction is on.  I haven't used it outdoors yet.  Maybe I will get better picture quality then.  I would like to try to reach a customer service department so that maybe I could find out what I'm doing wrong, but I haven't had any luck in doing that either.  I suggest if you get a digital camera don't wait a long time to use it","We've had this camera for almost three years now and take it everywhere. The features are easy to understand and use and the photo quality (at top resolution) is jim-dandy for taking pics of scenery and people.<br />For the price, this is an absolutely great camera.","Pros:<br />Great outdoor image quality<br />Battery life is pretty good (can fill 128mb smartdisk)<br />Image Transfer to PCs is extremely easy, no need for any software<br />Cons:<br />LCD is not high quality(this is a problem with all fuji cameras)<br />LCD practically shows nothing under low-light conditions<br />Red Eye is occasionally a problem<br />This camera was my first camera, and I still love it. It is comparable to new cameras in image quality.<br />My only problem with this camere is night shots, otherwise it is exellent.","I was a little leary of buying one of these because I was spoiled by having a 5Meg camera for 2 years, but I was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, the battery life is much better than I had expected for an optical zoom camera.  That alone made me very happy.  The pictures are acceptable at 2 Megs and as long as you aren't looking for perfection, they are good enough for most applications.  Finally, it is relatively small and light and easy to carry around.<br />Drawbacks, the software included isn't intuitive at all.  I wasn't even sure if I had installed the correct program.  The camera menus are also a little hard to understand unless you read the manual a couple of times.","I have had mine for about a year now and was originally impressed, but over time have become increasingly irritated.  I agree with the other two posters about their complaints, which have become my biggest issues.  The lens cover if moved ever so slightly will shut the camera down and by the time you move it back and take the shot, you've lost your picture.  My second issue is also the time it takes between hitting the button and it actually snapping the shot.  It seems forever and with toddlers they've done moved on and the picture is actually of them moving away.  It seems that once you hit the button, it would snap that instance, but that is not the case. Also, by the time you turn the camera on, open the lens cover, wait for the lens to come out and snap, the subjects (in my case toddlers) are done. lol~<br />I have lost many, many good shots over the past year and the time issue is my biggest. I need more of a one shot camera that just snaps, no delays etc.","We bought a refurbished 2400 last August and have been very happy with it.  The picture quality is very good for the price.  Picture distribution to relatives is especially easy now that they are digital!  Battery consumption is a little high if you don't give the camera a break once in a while.<br />The one design flaw I found is that the \"ready\" light is right next to the viewing lense, so in low-light situations, I cannot see the subject of the picture--I only see the light.  Fortunately, the pictures are digital, so I snap a few and hope one turns out!","This camera is very simple to operate and takes great pictures!  They are very sharp and the color is great.  It doesn't seem to eat up batteries like some other cameras I owned.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the LCD screen is kind of useless in bright light, and sometimes there is a delay between the time you press the shutter button and when it takes the picture, but I heard that happens with some other cameras too.  Still, I am very, very pleased with this camera.","I have had the 2400 for about a month now, and I must say I am very happy with it. I am a hobby photographer with a fairly expensive and extensive 35mm SLR gear which I still use a lot, but for the family-type snaps and when I really want to travel light, the 2400 is all I take. It takes really good pictures in most situations, and it is dead easy to handle. It is also small enough that you really do take it with you most anywhere. The lens seem very sharp and the exposure is right on most of the time. It does eat batteries, but that is not a problem if you get rechargeable ones. It is completeley manual with very limited ways for you to affect it manually. Shutter lag and focus lag is a bit slow, but something you get with this kind of camera. There is no way that I know of to mount a filter in front of the lens, but that is something most people would not miss. In bright outdoors light and in dark situations it is hard to impossible to see what is on the LCD, but then you always have the viewfinder. The problem with the viewfinder is that it doesn't show everything that will be on the photo you take (only 80% or so?). Buy a bag to keep the 2400 in (I got a LowePro bag to hang on my belt). Get some rechargeable AA batteries (I have 12). Get some memory (buy 64mb or 128mb cards). And as with any camera, using a tripod will increase the likelihood of you getting a sharp picture. Get a small tabletop tripod that you carry with you - it will give you better pictures.  I cannot really say anything about the quality of prints from the 2400 since I hardly ever print any of my snaps, but judging from the few prints I've made, I'd say you can print up to 8x10 from most frames (if you shoot at 1600x1200 with little compression) with good quality.","The moment I took the camera out of the box, I was pointing and clicking (extremly easy to use). The camera is loaded with features. I found the sceen to be clear and a easy target for taking difficult shots. The zoom lens adjusted without effort and the resolution selections to be fantastic.  Downloading was a breeze, including directly to my printer. I was truly amazed at the finished product and will never use a 35mm camera again... Great job Fuji...","I purchased this camera 3 weeks ago along with another different manufacturer's camera. Found it on sale due to the release of the 2600.  This camera outshines the competition.  Very easy to use, beautiful pictures, quick uploads, no install problems on Win ME.  I carry it with me daily and have used it daily to print pics from.  All I can say is run, don't walk to buy it. Only negative is battery life but that's a given. Be sure to invest in a camera case for protection and larger Smart Media card.","I found on receiving my camera that I could not download the software on my computer.  The model was not one of the choices to choose from that I bought.  Therefore, I did'nt use my camera for quit sometime.  When the portable printers came out for digital I bought one and started to use my camera.  Unfortunately, the color is not what I expected and it seems to have to much red in it.  Sometimes I also get red eye even when the eye reduction is on.  I haven't used it outdoors yet.  Maybe I will get better picture quality then.  I would like to try to reach a customer service department so that maybe I could find out what I'm doing wrong, but I haven't had any luck in doing that either.  I suggest if you get a digital camera don't wait a long time to use it","We've had this camera for almost three years now and take it everywhere. The features are easy to understand and use and the photo quality (at top resolution) is jim-dandy for taking pics of scenery and people.<br />For the price, this is an absolutely great camera.","Pros:<br />Great outdoor image quality<br />Battery life is pretty good (can fill 128mb smartdisk)<br />Image Transfer to PCs is extremely easy, no need for any software<br />Cons:<br />LCD is not high quality(this is a problem with all fuji cameras)<br />LCD practically shows nothing under low-light conditions<br />Red Eye is occasionally a problem<br />This camera was my first camera, and I still love it. It is comparable to new cameras in image quality.<br />My only problem with this camere is night shots, otherwise it is exellent.","I was a little leary of buying one of these because I was spoiled by having a 5Meg camera for 2 years, but I was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, the battery life is much better than I had expected for an optical zoom camera.  That alone made me very happy.  The pictures are acceptable at 2 Megs and as long as you aren't looking for perfection, they are good enough for most applications.  Finally, it is relatively small and light and easy to carry around.<br />Drawbacks, the software included isn't intuitive at all.  I wasn't even sure if I had installed the correct program.  The camera menus are also a little hard to understand unless you read the manual a couple of times.","I have had mine for about a year now and was originally impressed, but over time have become increasingly irritated.  I agree with the other two posters about their complaints, which have become my biggest issues.  The lens cover if moved ever so slightly will shut the camera down and by the time you move it back and take the shot, you've lost your picture.  My second issue is also the time it takes between hitting the button and it actually snapping the shot.  It seems forever and with toddlers they've done moved on and the picture is actually of them moving away.  It seems that once you hit the button, it would snap that instance, but that is not the case. Also, by the time you turn the camera on, open the lens cover, wait for the lens to come out and snap, the subjects (in my case toddlers) are done. lol~<br />I have lost many, many good shots over the past year and the time issue is my biggest. I need more of a one shot camera that just snaps, no delays etc.","We bought a refurbished 2400 last August and have been very happy with it.  The picture quality is very good for the price.  Picture distribution to relatives is especially easy now that they are digital!  Battery consumption is a little high if you don't give the camera a break once in a while.<br />The one design flaw I found is that the \"ready\" light is right next to the viewing lense, so in low-light situations, I cannot see the subject of the picture--I only see the light.  Fortunately, the pictures are digital, so I snap a few and hope one turns out!","This camera is very simple to operate and takes great pictures!  They are very sharp and the color is great.  It doesn't seem to eat up batteries like some other cameras I owned.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the LCD screen is kind of useless in bright light, and sometimes there is a delay between the time you press the shutter button and when it takes the picture, but I heard that happens with some other cameras too.  Still, I am very, very pleased with this camera.","I have had the 2400 for about a month now, and I must say I am very happy with it.

Be sure to invest in a camera case for protection and larger Smart Media card.","It's been 9 mos and 1000's of pictures since I bought this camera and I have no regrets.  Although my wife still uses our 35 mm camera, most of the really good pictures we've taken in the past year (mostly of our kids) have come from my Finepix 2400. When I was shopping for a digicam last February, I compared this camera to the other 2.1 mpixel w/ 3x optical zoom offerings from Olympus (more money, no usb), Canon (digital elph...smaller, but more money, only 2x zoom, and proprietary battery), and Nikon (not as well reviewed as the others). The best features for the price fell out w/ the Finepix 2400. The only features it is missing  a video out to TV and movie mode.  I didn't think I'd ever really use these features so this was something I didn't mind missing out on.<br />  Advantages: 3x optical zoom. Price is great. Most important: picture quality is superb. I take all my shots at the best resolution and highest quality.  The 64mb card I added holds around 80 pics and I rarely fill it (thats like 3 or 4  rolls of film.) If I was going away, I'd probably step down a level in resolution or quality to fit more. I print on a regular two year old hp printer on photo paper and the results are amazing. Unless you specifically look from a few inches away, you'd never know the pics are from a digicam. Downloading to computer is a snap w/ the usb adapter.  Just plug in the camera and it appears as a drive so you can do whatever you want. The included software has run fine on two computers, one w/ Win 98 and the other with WinME. Battery time is superb with NiMH batteries. I had heard all sorts of horror stories about digicams and battery life, but they last fine (I use the LCD about half the time). If I go out with fresh batteries they've never run out on me.<br />  Downsides: Included photo viewer software is only fair and it took me a couple times to install correctly (note this was the photo viewing software, not the drivers...the drivers installed fine). Don't get me wrong, the software does the basics fine, it just isnt the greatest. On the plus side, Adobe Photodeluxe is included, and this is a terrific program. Low light performance is not great, but this is likely with any camera of this type. Startup and lag time between photos is also a little slow, but my understanding is this is also standard for digital cameras. Finally, the lag from shutter press to capture does take some getting used to.  Partially pressing the shutter button to \"ready\" the image helps, but you don't get the near instant response you do from a conventional 35mm camera. The zoom will also not work for a couple seconds when the camera is writing a picture to the card.<br />  Summary- There are lots of 2.1 megapixel digital cameras out there.  The combination of great picture quality, all the features I wanted, and a price below the rest of the other cameras in it's class made this a great choice that has held up over time. I would buy this camera again. The only things it is missing are a movie mode (gimmicky and useless in my opinion) and a tv out jack.","I have owned this camera for 10 months, and have taken it all over the world. I continue to be very pleased with the performance, and amazed at the picture quality. I was a professional photographer for some years, and so I was not expecting such good quality from a mid-range \"point and shoot\" camera.<br />I have heard a lot of nonsense spoken about digital cameras, especially that \"you need the most megapixels you can get\". This is simply not true. The Fuji is a 2.1 Mpixel unit, meaning that you can take pics from 640x480 up to 1600x1200 pixels. More pixels does NOT mean a sharper picture - it means a bigger picture, both on screen and on paper when you print it. However, a big reason that people use digital cameras is so that they can email pics to loved ones. A 1600x1200 pic in fine mode runs out at 760 kb - about the biggest size you would want to try to email. Personally, I use 1280x960 in normal mode, which uses about 310 kb per pic. (A 640x480 pic is 90 kb). The supplied 8mb memory card holds about 24 pics at 1280x960. I bought a 32mb Viking card ... which holds 99 of these pics, and it works great. The 1280x960 resolution gives me a letter sized print (8.5\"x11\") with good quality. How much bigger does anyone need to go? You only need more megapixels if you are a pro photographer or if you plan to print out poster sized prints all of the time.<br />The optical zoom works very well on the Fuji, but you should use the LCD screen to compose - the viewfinder is not completely accurate. (You get more picture on the left side than the viewfinder shows). The slow synch flash setting that is available is not a common feature on cameras at this price, but is superb for taking night time pics where you want the subject (e.g. your loved one) lit by flash, while also getting the background (e.g. city lights) properly exposed.<br />All in all I am extremely pleased with this product. I bought a top of the line Sony 3 years ago, and the Fuji blows it away. Nowadays I don't even bother taking my 35mm SLR with me!<br />Happy Snapping!","[...]  I went shopping locally here in the Portland, OR area and was able to purchase the camera, camera case, 64 meg smart media card, and a monster rechargeable battery pack with 4 extra batteries, all for under [...].<br />As far as functionality is concerned, I love this camera.  It does everything it says it does and does it well.  I took well over 100 pictures in the first couple of days and was hard pressed to take a picture that didn't turn out nicely.  The 'automatic' setting on the camera truly works and the pictures show it.<br />There are very few 2.0+ megapixel cameras out there for this price that bring the quality to the table that this one does.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed.","I received the FinePix 2400 as a gift, and the instant gratification factor of seeing and saving or deleting photos immediately, ease of USB connection downloading to my laptop, plus the resolution quality that, at a minimum, rivals film prints are keeping this thing in my hands more than my Canon Elan IIe SLR (which I still love).  I didn't expect that to happen, as I tend to turn my nose up at point-and-shoots, but this camera rocks.  It's a joy to play with as soon as you open the package.  Slide film might still have an edge on resolution, but hey, instant digital is instant digital - no wait, no fuss, and no distortions in contrast, scratches, dust inside the body, or what-have-you that unavoidably occur in developing prints.<br />The downsides are several but all relatively minor.  First, it won't completely replace your SLR. The FinePix 2400 has a reasonable amount of added manual control which is nice for us tweakers, but it's slightly cumbersome to navigate menus and buttons, compared to most automatic SLRs that you have familiarity with and which have far more versatility for fixing the lighting and other problems another reviewer mentioned.  (Still, I've gotten some great photos of lit up buildings at night with some slight tweaking!)  Second, the viewfinder is a pain for people like me whose left eye is better than our right;  I find myself constantly wiping nose smudges off the digital viewscreen and hoping I don't scratch the latter.  Third, the viewfinder doesn't correspond as well as it should to the real frame of the photo--I keep thinking I've got the perfect composition only to find out the field of view on the actual photo is larger than I expected.  You move closer and hope, a bit.  Fourth, if you're sometimes impatient with the zoom, like I am, it occasionally goes a bit loopy in extending and retracting until you turn it off and/or shut the lens cover.  Fifth, as everyone else says, it eats batteries voraciously, particularly if you use the digital viewing screen in its \"movie camera viewing mode\" (I always turn it off completely except to view photos);  a rechargeable adapter of some kind is necessary and on my shopping list.  Sixth, get at least a 32 MB or bigger flash card.  8MB is not enough;  128MB will keep you more than happy.<br />That said, I haven't needed a tripod with this camera.  It's been remarkably steady even with low-light indoors or outdoors, but  one can't hurt, especially not my ultra-compact plastic mini-tripod.  Plus, unlike other reviewers, I wouldn't want more annoying questions than the existing two stages standing between me and deleting photos.  No bigger than most point and shoots, the FinePix 2400 is nicely compact and its photo quality is such that I more often than not end up leaving my SLR at home, just to save weight and bulk and avoid attracting too much attention with expensive gadgets while roaming about Eastern Europe (unless I know I need the SLR for the perfect picture).  The software bundle is also a plus--although the included Adobe version is rather stripped down, it does fine in basic, necessary touch-ups of digital or scanned film. You can adjust color balance, do continuous shots, and all sorts of other nifty things with the FinePix 2400, but the basic point-and-shoot operation is easy and results are high quality!","I agree with the other reviews. This is a great camera. It comes with some great software that the manual does NOT tell you about. I only found out by browsing through the files on the CD. You get all this for free: Adobe PhotoDeluxe (much better than the software that the manual tells you to install!), Adobe ActiveShare (another great product that lets you do cool things like make slide shows, postcards etc.), and Adobe PDFWriter, which lets you create Adobe Acrobat documents. Look for setup.exe files on the CD and run them! Why Fuji don't tell people about these things is a mystery....","I just started using this camera and was pleasantly surprised about a couple things: 1.  the enclosed 8mb smart media card can actually hold quite a good number of the lowest resolution pictures, the kind you'd post on the internet.  So, even though I upgraded and bought a 64MB card, the 8mb card is not even full at 50 some pictures (set at 640). 2.  Easy to use and get started, with minimal extras (i.e. no black&white/fusia color capabilities - and anyway, you can do this using a software editing package). The two dowsides that I painfully discovered: 1.  The enlcosed USB connection to the PC does not support Windows NT, for uploading images to your computer.  I'm not sure the answer here, but I'm guessing I have to invest dollars into another input device 2.  It is way too easy to Format (Initailize) the Smart Media card, which will erase all stored and protected images.  Unfortunately, I let a friend play around with the camera and he did just that - erased everything, by selecting Format.  It did ask him if it was \"OK\", confirming what he was about to do, but if you're not careful, you'll be deleting your vacation.<br />All in all, so far I'm happy with the purchase","This is my first digital camera and I own a little 233 iMac. I shoppped the heck out of the available cameras that were Mac friendly and finally bought this one. I expected web post quality pictures only, but what I got were sharp, colorful and well saturated photos worthy of printing. The computer set up was simple. I snapped my first test shots, downloaded them to my computer via USB and had them on my desktop within 5-10 minutes ready to send to the grandparents.<br />The quality of the camera itself is high. I handled other models before buying this one and some of them were a bit cheesy/cheap in construction. This feels like a well made point and shoot and the pictures are superb. Easy to use, great pictures and well made, I recommend this camera highly.","This was the first time I ever bought a digital camera, and I had absolutely no idea what to look for.  This camera is pretty neat, it's not really expensive, and for a first time digital user, I would recommend it.  If you read the instructions, you will learn how to use the features. However, if you were to break something, like a part on the lens unit (dropping the camera), the cost to replace the lens unit(they don't sell you just the part you need)is almost as high as the cost of the camera itself, and this does not include labor.  So, get the camera if you are a first time user, it's easy to set up...don't drop the camera, for you will not be happy when you have to repair it! As far as the computer software that comes with the camera, well I was disappointed with it.  Overall, I would recommend this product.","I purchased this camera because of its 3x optical zoom. I am very impressed with the picture quality and the battery consumtion seems good even with using the lcd monitor for taking pictures. I would recommend rechargeable batteries though The only downside to it so far is the battery cover doesn't stay shut.","This is a great camera, FUJI is not good in documenting the features of this camera.<br />Copying the files from camera to hardware is very easy. Open Windows explorer and select the removable drive select all and paste it onto c: drive, it is matter of few secs. U can save your battery and time.<br />This camera can handle 128MB card also.","I've been shooting the Finepix 1400 for a year,  so I was interested in this camera when it came out. I recently had the opportunity to play with one for a while and I was impressed with what I saw. It's a well thought out design, still a good value, and an excellent example of technological evolution.<br />More than just a higher-resolution version of the 1400, the Finepix 2400 is an evolutionary successor that builds on the features of the 1400. The ergonomics that made the 1400 easy to use are still there, but the resolution is doubled, and there's a lot more manual control available- something I find myself missing in the 1400. While the automatic mode produces fine exposures, photographers used to the flexibility of a manual camera will find much to like here.  There's more exposure control, a new color balance control, and a sequence shooting capability that should please sports fans. All this for a price not much higher than that of the 1400 a year ago.<br />There are a few downsides. Shooters with a dominant left eye will find the optical viewfinder hard to use as their noses will tend to get in the way. The supplied 8MB Smart Card is far too small; you'll need a 32MB or preferably a 64MB card to take advantage of the camera's capability. Luckily the price of memory has plummeted over the past year, so that's no real drawback.<br />In short, this is a reasonably priced camera with good resolution and good optics that's suitible for the novice or the experienced photographer. I expect it'll be as big a hit with buyers as the Finepix 1400 was.","This is a neat and very handy little point and shoot digital with sufficient resolution for any web stuff, and useable prints. The controls are straightforward, the battery life reasonable, and the USB feature convenient for quick dumps to the computer. The white-balance options are also a good addition.<br />Things to get for this camera in order to extend its appeal are the following:<br />Photoshop LE 5.0 or Photoshop Elements. This software by Adobe is about a hundred bucks and will let you do some great things that are way beyond the scope of the included bundle. Think of it as your digital darkroom; - a priority purchase.<br />An A.C. adaptor, and rechargeable batteries including a charger, are a must to avoid spending a fortune on batteries. You could also consider making up a battery-pack by using a  battery holder, D-Cells, and a power cord that plugs in where the A.C. adaptor would normally go: the larger size cells lasting a great deal longer than the AAs.<br />Definitely get a tripod. And maybe a light meter as well, since this will let you experiment more easily, which is after all one of the great things about a digital camera - you can try things without wasting film.","The reviews were good, but the pictures are even better than advertised!  This compact, handy little camera takes absolutely great shots for the amateur or first-time digitaller.  I've used several Mavicas, and the 2400 is much better.  Colors are rich and details are sharp.  Quality is especially good in well lit situations:  outdoors, or brightly lit rooms.  The flash works okay, but is prone to red-eye, although the red-eye reduction works moderately well.  Battery life is excellent.  We spent a week at Disney World, took 130 shots, mostly with the LCD display on and many with flash, without having to change batteries (NiMH, 1600mAH, Rayovac).  My 64MB smartcard will hold about 160 pictures at 2 megapixel with \"normal\" JPEG compression (half that at the camera's best resolution).  Even the 8MB card that ships with the camera will hold a respectable 20 shots.  The camera is surprisingly rugged - it's even survived a bounce off a hardwood floor administered by my 2yr old.  My biggest complaints are that the LCD display is pretty much useless in the dark or in bright sunlight (the optical viewfinder works very well though), and the delay time between depressing the shutter button and when the picture is recorded is disconcertingly large, making it difficult to catch a moving target.  The software loading was very easy, and transferring pictures to my iMac via USB is a snap.  I was disappointed that the PhotoDeluxe software which shipped with the unit was only for Windows, but the viewer for the MAC isn't bad.  Altogether an extremely good value.","To be honest, it is hard to rate this camera because it is the only and first digital camera that I owned.  I have included some links of pictures that I actually took with the camera (see below).<br />I rarely use the LCD screen to take pictures because it is usally too bright outside to view the screen.  I usually take the pictures with the viewfinder which is a good thing because it saves your batteries. The camera seems to take really great indoor pictures.  The camera seems to excell with panaromic views.<br />For accessories I bought a case, two sets of rechargable batteries, a recharger and a 32 Meg SmartMedia Card (holds 40 hi resolution pictures).  You can get those accessories anywhere....<br />I usually take my camera out of my case an put in my pocket for easy carrying.  I have taken my camera skiing this past season.....","My previous digital experience was with a cheapie that I found to be absolutely worthless--still I had a need for occasional \"instant photos\".  So I read several online reviews and once I saw samples from the Fujifilm Finepix 2400, I was really impressed!  Even better, it was the most affordable digital camera offering this resolution--as of December 2000.<br />My intended use was really for \"throw-away\" or temporary stuff, (i.e. no baby pictures,) but the quality turned out to be so good, and the camera interfaced so well and so fast with my Blue & White Apple G3, that I quickly became addicted to this camera.<br />There's a lot to be said for the instant gratification you get with digital:  1. You see the photo appear instantly on the small LCD screen on the back so you know right away if the shot is good or not.  2.  No waiting for the film developing.  If you're near your computer, you can view the full-size results immediately.<br />And as for archiving and trading--now I can burn a CD with up to hundreds of hi-quality photos from this camera for about 2 bucks (plus whatever electricity costs in California these days!) That's a big savings over double/triple prints I had to buy so the grandparents could get copies.  Now I just send them a CD.<br />If you're not a pro, and you're not going to blow up your photos for poster size prints, I can't imagine why you'd need to spend twice the price for a 3-4 megapixel camera, because this one will suit you just fine.<br />My accessories of choice: Nice little case to protect camera, with a little storage.  NiMh battery charger with two sets of NiMH AA batteries (compare prices--these are now easy to find in drug/department stores), one set in the camera, one set in the case for back-up.  Of course you'll want to collect a few SmartMedia cards--pick 'em up as you find them on sale.","I am very pleased with this camera.  The picture quality is very good, software is easy to use and setup and camera settings are simple.  I also purchased rechargeable batterys with a charger and a 64MB Smart media card.  I highly recommend the combination.  I have used a Sandisk card reader and while it is a nice toy it is not necessary for this camera.<br />I have also used a Kodak DC265 and a Canon S100 camera.  I feel that the Fujifilm is a much better value.","I received this camera for Christmas and I think it's great! I bought 4 rechargeable NiMH batteries, a 32 MB card and an ac adapter as recommended by reviews I had read. I was able to start taking pictures as soon as I took the camera out of the box and it took me only about 5 minutes to install the software on my computer and start viewing the pics. My only other experience with digital photography was using two different models of the Sony Mavica. I found my Fuji 2400 Zoom to be much easier to use and the pictures are clearer (although that could just be because I never really figured out how to set the Mavicas properly). I don't have a photo printer at the moment so I don't know what the printed photos look like. Most of the digital images I've taken have been very sharp especially outdoors with good light levels. Nighttime shots are another matter altogether. I have been unsuccessful in taking scenery shots at low light levels. However, I was never able to do this with my point and shoot regular camera. This is not a camera for professional photographers or even aspiring photographers; this is a camera for those who just want to remember their vacations, birthday parties and everyday events. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this camera, especially since it only costs about ($).","After doing our research, we bought this camera for our 13 year old daughter.  After only 1 week, we are fully versed in its many features, and are now sending high quality photos to friends and relatives all over.  The USB connection is fast and easy, and all the features make this the best buy for the money! Everything about the camera is aimed at making even novices like us comfortable using it, and it is small enough to go anywhere, but large enough to feel comfortable in your hands when shooting.  I recommend it highly.","This was my first digital camera. I had mostly been using a 35mm SLR and occaisionally a compact 35mm previously. I thought it was a great deal, so I joined the digital photography era. I have been extremely satisfied with the camera. For the price, I did not expect it to compare with my SLR. Many of the pictures I have taken, however, are comparable. The quality of the images are truly amazing to me. The auto flash and focus function as well as any compact SLR I have had. Compared to other digital cameras I have been exposed to (family and friends) the camera is quick to boot up and respond to pushing the shutter. The software that comes with it is not perfect, but I found it very easy to use. I am still trying to get an AC adapter for it. I have been using rechargable batteries and they last a reasonable period of time. With a 64MB card, I have taken 177 high quality pictures and down loaded them through the USB cable in about 6 minutes. For those who don't want to spend much for compact 35mm equivalent that is easy to carry and use and can take great pictures, I think this is a good choice.<br />Since I wrote my original review 8 months ago, I have had a problem with the lens protector continueously shutting the camera down and had to send it for repair. This took over one month and the camera still tends to shut down if the lens protector is moved even slighly. Also, I have noticed that pictures taken in a low light setting (with flash, of course) are frequently out of focus. Pictures taken in bright light are very sharp. I have reduced my rating from 4 to 3 stars.","Just bought the 2400 yesterday and immediately fell in love.  Small, easy to use..having never used a digital camera before...the resolution is amazing, comparable to my Nikon 35mms. I resisted getting a digital but once I saw the first images, I was hooked.  Lugging my 35mm around was sometimes a pain....this goes right in a pocket.  My nine year old granddaughter loves it and learned to use it in a few minutes. I would suggest buying a SanDisk Imagemate to quickly download your pictures to the PC..no need to use the camera and, of course, it saves your batteries.","When looking to get my first digital camera I was looking at the Nikons and Olympus digitals. After reviewing the features and prices I choose the 2400 and I have been very happy. It takes great pictures, has good image resolution and the two pictures I have actually had printed turned out well. I use this camera at work and for personal use, I appreciate the direct USB connection and fast transfer speed. I found the controls easy to use and battery life was better then I expected.<br />Given the rate of progress in these cameras and with digital photography I believe that I have a camera I can use for several years even if its outdated in 6 months. All in all a very good deal and a great place to start.","Just a few words to say that I recently bought this camera as I have been after one for a long time.The price in the UK was good and the features this camera contains are everything an amateur like myself needs.I have been able to take so many pictures,touch them up when downloaded and now family all over the world can see an excellent quality picture seconds after it's ben taken.I would recommend this to anyone who has a budget to keep to.Don't go and spend $500 when you can get this for £300.","Most of the Mx cameras if not all do not have a video out capability, such as allowing one display on a tv. Most competition do."]},{"name":"Leica Digilux 4.3","amazon_reviews":["I wanted to try shooting with a Leica, and I bought a used digilux 4.3 off Ebay for $135.

It does have its good and bad points:<br />Good points:<br />1. Nice body - resembles a standard camera - viewfinder is useful  except for macro when you have to use the LCD to aim. It grips and feels like a standard camera, which makes framing and squaring up an image easier for those trained on old film cameras.<br />2. Easy to use - despite some claims, the instructions are clear, and for the most the settings seem intuitive. It is easy to move between the various preset exposure-speed settings. These are preferrable over the generic \"auto\" setting. The base \"auto\" mode makes too many compromises, and results in images which are just \"off\".<br />Bad points:<br />1. Missing some stuff. It comes with a small memory card, and without a rechargeable battery. Like nearly all digitals the Nikon inhales battery power. You MUST get a rechargeable battery, and a larger capacity Compact Flash memory card. Luckily the price seems to be falling on these. You should also get a card reader for your PC. Hooking up the camera to the PC is possible, but a card reader is far more convenient. No software included.<br />2. The lens cap must be removed manually, and if you forget to do so, you'll get very angry and worrisome sounding whirling and grinding noises. Most basic point and shoot and APS cameras have a warning mechanism to prevent the recessed lens from deploying while the lens cap is on. The on/off switch is convenient, but at times too much so. It can be jostled and you'll reach into your bag to discover it in the \"on\" position with the battery sapped. A firmer switch with a \"snap\" would be an improvement.<br />3. It is a bit pricey - I think that it would sell quite well, were it [...] cheaper...<br />Still it is a nice camera with good technicial features, and capable of producing beautiful images.","Overall this camera is OK. However, the price is not cheap at all, especially you have to spend another $120 to get rechargeable battery and charger. I would rather get Olympus digital camera with high quality, nice features and lower cost.","Taking a researched chance, I ordered this product through Amazon reading others' and the editorial review.  Technically it appeared similar to the Canon S20 (competition at the time), but reviews made the difference.<br />Five Stars from me.  Seven months now...still amazing me.<br />Deciding factors: -Technical adjustability -Metering system -Video mode (it's debatable whether I miss audio) -CF slot (compat with my other device and easy PC-Card adapter) -3M pixel -2CR5 battery (can purchase anywhere and same as my 35mm SLR) -Size, size, size<br />Still happy with: -Finite control -CF memory -Size -Durability -Easy white-balance calibration (when auto won't do) -Image quality!<br />Also purchased: -Lithium battery and recharger (a must!) -Slide adapter (not heavily used) -64MB CF (probably will go for 128MB and shoot with abandon) -Nikon's Case (works and fits, but I wish had shoulder strap)<br />Aloha.  .d.","My 1st digital, so maybe I'm somewhat biased, got a great deal (less then $500) on camera, battery, and charger was display unit, local Bxxx Bxx had close out on this model for some reason.<br />The good:<br />GREAT detail, 3.4 meg is fantastic, have had 8 x 10's made, very comparable to 35mm.<br />Easy to use in AUTO Mode Easy to use in SCENE Mode<br />The Bad:<br />One irritating point is the \"noise\" the camera makes as it tries to focus. The Nikon 880 makes a lot of \"whizzing\" sounds as it focuses -- a bit too conspicuous in quiet environments.<br />MUST have rechager and rechargeable batteries<br />No photo editing s/w included.<br />If you get beyond point and shoot, it is VERY complicated!<br />Bottom Line: I REALLY like this camera it takes incredible pictures.","I've been using a Nikon 880 for over 6 months and have the greatest admiration for its abilities. It is a wonderful pocket-sized camera. It is designed to be easy to use and powerful for its size. I seldom miss a shot! The photos are super sharp; the color is amazing; and it's fast, compared to other digital cameras. I purchased the rechargeable battery and charger/adapter when I bought the camera. I also upgraded to a 128 MB Compact Flash disk. I find Adobe's PhotoDeluxe 4.0 a useful photo enhancement program. Nikon has maintained its premier position in the camera world with this consumer-oriented camera.","I looked at the Coolpix 800 and 880, before deciding on the 880.  It is more expensive than the 800, but WELL worth it you'll see. Here's why:<br />Megapixels. The Coolpix 800 takes 2.1 megapixel pictures, but the 880 take 3.1 megapixel.  (More pixels are preferred to less since this will affect your image quality. And believe me - you will SEE the difference!)<br />Zoom. The 800 has a 2x optical, plus 2.5 digital zoom lens; however, the 880 has a 2.5x optical and the digital zoom.  You always want as high an optical zoom because using pure digital zoom will make your pictures look fuzzy!<br />Memory. Both the 800 and 880 come with 8 MB of CompactFlash, but most people would agree that this isn't enough.  Purchase an additional CompactFLash card for 32 MB or more and you'll be happy you did.<br />Downloading. The 800 only connects via serial port, but the 880 connects via serial OR USB. THe USB connection is MUCH MUCH faster for downloading pics to yoru computer, but the serial (800's only method) is horrendously slow.<br />Batteries.  THe 800 uses 4 AA batteries, but the 880 uses far superior and much longer-lasting 2CR5 lithium batteries. The 880's batteries also weigh less.<br />Price. This is the ONLY reason you shoudl consider the 800 (...) over the 880 (...).  But let's face it, if you have ... for the 800, you should fork over the extra ... and get the 880 so you can have a digital camera that will last you more than a year. The 800 is being phased out by Nikon. Buy the 880 today! It's simply amazing :)","The most important element for me is the quality of the pictures. In that regard, the Nikon 880 does an outstanding job compared to past digital cameras. Sharpness, brightness, etc. are all pretty good.  At the Fine Quality/Full Image mode, I can squeeze 81 pictures onto a 128MB Compact Flash card - perfect for a full day's use. I also bought the rechargeable battery, which is an absolute must given that digital cameras eat-up batteries. I like the fact that the camera can also fit a CR5 battery, which is readily available in most shops. That way, if I run out of juice half way during the day, I can always just walk into almost any photo shop and buy an extra battery (some of my older models did not support this simple option).<br />Nikon has preset scene modes that are great to use. I like the fact that I can easily switch to a landscape or indoor mode with a few clicks. The menus are also very well laid out and quite intuitively easy to use. I was a little distraught though when I went to install the software and the computer refused to recognize the USB connection. Then I realized that I had to download the USB drivers from the Nikon website in order for the USB connection to be recognized (the software included is for the \"serial\" connection and the updated software has to be downloaded). This was extra burden I would rather have avoided, but maybe this was a problem only for the early Nikon 880 shipments.<br />I cannot sing enough praise for such a detailed, yet easy to use camera. It can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be, and that perhaps is its biggest selling point.<br />One irritating point is the \"noise\" the camera makes as it tries to focus. The Nikon 880 makes a lot of \"whizzing\" sounds as it focuses -- a bit too conspicuous in quiet environments.<br />In the end, the Nikon 880 is simply an outstanding digital camera that should last me at least two more generations of digital photography. The only thing that bugged me was that I had to dish out extra money for the rechargeable battery, which in my opinion should have been included. Nevertheless, this is the new ESSENTIAL product for digital photography.-DC","Three main features of the CoolPix 880 make the camera my favorite of the four I have used extensively.<br />First, the camera is very small! It is no larger than your typical advantix film camera, and is light enough so as not to be a burden in a purse, bag, or even large pocket. As a result of its small size, I find myself taking it most everywhere I go and getting some great shots!<br />Second, the quality is incredible. Though this camera, like all other digital cameras, does not perform particularly well under low-light conditions, the resolution and clarity of the images is incredible if you give the camera a decent amount of light! Edges are crisp, colors brilliant, and details clear.<br />Third, the camera has a variety of helpful but EASY TO USE features. This is important. Unlike the Canon G1, using the more advanced features (such as Snow and Beach mode, Portrait Mode, etc.) is as easy as turning a dial and selecting which mode you want. Really! No fussing with multiple menus and dials. Setting up the date and time, resolution, quality, etc. is also very easy and quick.<br />The only shortcoming of the 880 is that it is by no means a complete camera out of the box. I had to spend quite a bit of money to get a suitable memory card and a rechargeable battery. It's a small pain, but for a camera as cool as this Nikon is, I can live with it.<br />A great buy.","I purchased a Coolpix 880 two weeks ago and have been incredibly impressed with the pictures I'm able to take with it.  They truly rival 35mm shots in quality, especially when combined with a good photo printer.  However, there are a few reservatins I have, mostly the result of the transition to digital photography.<br />First, the battery.  You must buy the rechargeable, and even that won't last too long.  I'm thinking of buying a second rechargeable for use on vacations, long family outings, etc.  I can't imagine trying to keep up with this thing's voracious appetite for batteries any other way.  YOu can minimize drain by shutting down the LCD or turning off full time autofocus, but that seems to destroy some of the reasons I bought the thing to begin with.<br />Second, the \"lag.\"  I put it in quotes, because I think it is mostly a matter of getting used to it.  You push the button the instant you want the picture taken (for example, a one year old coming down a slide); the camera takes it around that time.  Maybe at the top, maybe at the bottom, maybe right when you thought it would happen.  Tricky.  Thankfully, one year olds are happy to go down slides repeatedly (by which I mean all day).  Even in the 2 weeks I have had the camera I have adapted, however, and this is no longer a problem.<br />On the whole, an excellent camera that will become better once I figure out exactly how to use it.","Recently i bought my first digital camera .It is great but rapidly depleted batteries are a problem.You have to buy special charger and batteries for camera.It would be nice to use other common battery types wit this camera. ... ...","Hi guys - got this camera after much umming and erring in January, and it takes great pictures. i wanted to say a word about some of the comments here saying that the initial battery power appears to not last much longer than the initial power up. Well - there's a weird flashing battery symbol that comes on very soon after you've loaded the camera  up for the first time, but if you ignore it, and simply turn it off, it carries on going. In fact I've taken a large number of photos off the first battery, and still haven't loaded up the rechargeable I bought in England. So there you go. I'm a bit dissapointed with the so-called SLR-esque qualities, but this could be through my only just beginning to stray off \"autofocus\" (it's a complicated wee thing). God luck with your photography. Oh yes, and the pixel depth is fine - there's a tiny wee amount of overt white speckling but it's genuinely miniscule and doesn't show up on the vast majority of photos.","I have only had my camera for a month, so regard these as first impressions. The camera is quite intuitive and good in usability (and I should know because I work as a usability engineer!), with enough controls and default features to satisfy anybody. I had an absolutely hellish time installing it with usb on Windows ME. I have since learned that Win ME and USB devices like this one are a major pain in the neck!!! I spent a lot of time with technical support troubleshooting this device. Hours!! But once it was installed, everything was okay. The package came with Adobe Photo Deluxe, which I'm ashamed to confess to loving (it handles a lot of stuff I used to do with Photoshop) The good thing is that their technical support is open 24 hours a day 7 days a week, a really remarkable thing!!!I bought a 96 MB card, which carries about 60-70 pictures at fine. I found the default settings (night, fireworks, landscape) to not work particularly well, but this may be my inexperience showing.<br />This camera really drains memory, and apparently it seems that the LED display must be on for the camera to take pictures. One problem I noticed is that the auto-shutoff feature doesn't work particularly well, and you have to always be on top of that. (sometimes I have to actually remove the batteries to turn it off). The battery charge display is somewhat misleading. A lot of time when it powers up it will show full power, but a minute later, that indicator will indicate only a quarter charge.<br />I'm not a pro, but I had so much fun taking pictures and playing around with the settings.","I'm a professional video news photographer, but wanted something simple for stills for my family use. The coolpix 880 was recomended by a friend who is into still photography.  The pictures are shockingly sharp and vivid, even on the standard resolution setting.  I print up these four at a time on an eight by ten sheet with an old HP 722 and photo paper, and the 4x5s are as good as 35 milimeter film.  If I increased the resolution I'm sure 8x10 enlargements would look sharp. The camera is easy to connect to the computer by a USB port, and downloading, and selecting the pictures for printing is simple. The downside is that on automatic, almost all the pictures appear slightly under exposed, and need minor brightness manipulation, which I have yet to figure out how to do.  Also, there is about a one second lag betweeen the time you push the shutter button and the time the picture is actually taken, which I'm still not used to.  The camera is almost useless without more memory and the rechargeable battery which all cost me about two hundred dollars extra.  This is my first digital camera, and while I've had to get used to all the differences from film, the bottom line is a sharp, clear, detailed picture, and this pocket camera delivers more where it counts the most.","My wife gave this camera for Christmas and I've had great fun with it.  My only advice would be to figure in the price of the re-chargeable battery and charger as a \"standard accessory\".  I will never give up my SLR 35mm film camera, but this just adds to the enjoyment of photography.","Most reviewers have praised the camera and complained about the small memory card and the need to buy the optional rechargeable battery. These comments are right on the mark. Based on this information, I bought the charger and rechargeable battery and ordered the camera with a 64MB Lexar memory card. I used the disposable battery first and got about two hours of use. The rechargeable battery also lasts about two hours and can be recharged in about one hour. My 64MB Lexar is backordered, so I'm using the standard 8MB memory card. It holds 9 compressed images. Needless to say, I'm looking forward to the 64MB upgrade. Nikon really needs to consider making these upgrades standard. I had one initial problem getting the camera to download to my USB port. I ended up checking the Nikon website and discovered that there is a patch available for Windows ME users. Once I downloaded and installed the patch, downloads are rock solid. On the very positive side, image quality is fantastic and the macro feature works great.","I have been looking for another digital camera since my first camera (minolta dimage 1500 zoom)was a total disappointment. For the past six weeks I've researched the Internet (Steve's Review, DPReview, Imaging Resources, etc) comparing, as my final choices the Canon Powershot 20, the Fujifilm 4700 and the Coolpix 880. My main criteria are 3 megapixel and being able to take it along wherever I go in my pocket. After reading all the reviews I decided to go for the Coolpix especially considering the ability to do some manual adjustments with the camera, although I consider myself a novice/amateur. I got my camera from Amazon.com four days after I ordered it. I got my rechargeable battery and charger at another internet site where it was cheaper. After playing with the different controls of the camera I was able to even use the manual control and was very impressed with the pictures. I was not impressed with the \"Scene\" mode at all. I prefer the CSM, P and A mode which was very easy to use and get perfect results. The \"Auto\" mode also works very well. The quality of the pictures and the ease of control is almost like night and day in comparison to my prior digital camera. For anyone considering a 3 megapixel digital camera I would recommend this, with the reminder to also get the rechargeable batteries at the same time. The battery that came with the camera did not last long. It lasted only long enough to enable me to study the different functions of the camera and was able to take only a few pictures with the original battery. I would have rated this camera as 5 stars if not for the limited aperture control of only two.","I love the features of this camera, however, Nikon has to do something about the poor & misleading advertising going around regarding accessories that actually works with this camera.<br />The CoolPix 880 CANNOT use Nikon's flash adapter (SK-E900), and an external flash cannot be synched because there is no flash synch connection.  An internet search of \"Coolpix 880\" and \"flash\" revealed over 15-sites that advertised you can use the SK-E900 flash adapter with the CoolPix 880.<br />Moreover, you CANNOT use *any* of Nikon's external lenses with the flash \"ON\" because the external lenses' physical dimensions blocks the flash and causes a half-circle shadow.  A quick call to Nikon's 7x24 tech. support confirmed this.  You MUST turn-off the \"flash\" in order to avoid any shadows.<br />Nikon and its dealers need to do a better job disclosing the above limitations of the Coolpix 880.<br />Lastly, you MUST get the rechargeable battery & charger to effectively use this camera.  Buying batteries gets old fast, and you really need two, just to be safe.<br />Otherwise, it is a great camera when you don't want to use external accessories.","Being a photo enthusiast, I didn't want to get a digital camera at first, but since I'm also a long-time web user, the process of shooting a whole roll of film, waiting to get my film developed, picking up the photos, scanning them into my computer, and resizing the images were a bit time-consuming.  I wanted a camera that was compact, took good photos and easy to adjust the settings, and I'd say that the Nikon CoolPix 880 comes pretty close.<br />After using a manual camera for years, this took a little getting used to.  There are many features on this camera, including pre-set \"scenes\" that adjust light/color/speed for those who just want to point-and-shoot and not worry about the settings - I took this camera on a trip to Mammoth Mountains and took GREAT photos in the snow (There's a scene for \"snow/beach\").  Also, I used the \"Indoor/Party\" scene and the photos came out GREAT.  Another great thing about this camera is its size.  Unlike most digital cameras out there, it fits in the palm of your hand and feels very natural to hold while taking pictures.  The pictures are sharp with great detail and vibrant colors.<br />My favorite thing about digital photography is INSTANT GRATIFICATION!  No more wasting rolls of film - you see what a photo looks like right after you take it, and if you don't like it, hit delete!  No more waiting at the photolab, and best of all, total customization!  The USB lets you download the photos in a flash, and with my trusty photo software, I can adjust colors, change brightness and contrast, and even air-brush out an imperfection or two ;-) and you don't need a fancy color printer to print out great photos - I've been using my Epson printer and using glossy photo paper - output looks terrific.  You can hardly tell that it was produced at home.<br />Now the cons: The CoolPix 880 comes with a 8MG compact flash card, if you are taking photos for only web use, you can fit as much as 90 pics.  If you're going to take higher-rez pictures for printing, you'll definitely need to shell out for a bigger card.  Another common problem with many cameras is battery life - they eat batteries like crazy.  For the planet's sake, don't buy disposable batteries!  Unfortunately, the CoolPix does not come with a battery charger, so you'll have to pay [more] for the charger.  With normal use, the battery will last about 2 hours, so you'll need to buy another battery and have it charged and ready to go.<br />This camera is perfect for those who want to invest a little more for a digital camera that takes great pictures with no fuss.  Highly recommended!","For the price of the Nikon 880, you are making a major commitment to digital photography.  The good news is the 880 delivers on all of its promises with few compromises. Incredible \"ease of use\" enables both novices and veterans to create great digital photos.  Image quality is outstanding and the features will keep have you experimenting for many a late night. I admit it, I am in love with this camera!<br />Another advantage you should not underestimate: the compact size and light weight of the 880.  My \"other camera\" is a N70, but size is an issue as I like to travel light.  The 880 always makes the road trip, either in the jacket pocket or briefcase.<br />Several issues to consider:  The 880 drains disposable batteries faster than any electronic gadget I've ever owned, so unless you have friends who work for Duracell you'll need to spring for the optional rechargeable battery and charger.  Plan to spend another $100 or so for both.  The camera comes with only an 8mb card so you may want to upgrade to 16 or 32mb. The software bundle is light, it will allow you to upload pictures but not much else.  Consider Adobe Photoshop LE or JASC Paint Shop to complete your setup.","The only reason that I didn't give this camera five star is that the bateery life is sucks and 8MB flash compact card is to little.<br />Picture queality is excellent! User friendly and full pack of features. This is an excellent buy!","I have previously owned a Nikon 800 and looked forward to the update with the 880. The camera is very impressive in terms of quality of photos and they hay have improved the ease in which you can functionally use the camera features from the 800. There are a number of features such as the preset scenes that are great to assist in certain situations. I bought it based on the previous experience with Nikon, but their decision to use a special camera battery instead of common AA alkaline, lithium or rechargeable batteries has left me with an expensive choice of options. I take a lot of pictures and the battery life in this particular camera is very short, so I can either use the rechargable batteries (which can be a problem in traveling), purchase a number of expensive photo style batteries or another third party battery supply pack (cumbersome). That type of battery cannot usually be found in rural areas that I travel. The other problem is that the base for a tripod does not have a provision for the alignment hole that some tripods have on the mounting plate. I still like the compactflash memory card and I have purchased a higher capacity card for this and other applications I have owned a number of digital cameras over the last five years for both work and personal activities and this is probably the best features for the price and size of camera. I have found that I am looking to other alternative for the future that may or may not include this particular camera. While I would highly recommend this camera for it's usefulness and features, I would be very apprehensive and cognizant of the battery issue.  Also, if I could find a suitable e-mail address for customer service at NikonUSA, I would probably let them know of this issue.","My wife and I just moved to texas and have family all over the country, and with our first baby on the way I decided to take the digital plunge. This camera is a gem. I've spent the last 9 months reading every review possible, looking for the right digital camera. I tossed around buying the olympus 2020/3000, the sony s70,The nikon coolpix 950 and the kodak 4800/dc290. Two months ago the 880 hit the market and I couldn't resist. I can't put it down. Figure the ac-adaptor and rechargeable battery into the price (shop around) I got them online for($) no tax and free shipping. The 8 meg card will hold 90 pictures at 640x480, 20 pix @ 1024x768 and about 6 pictures at it's highest resoultion (that's if you use compression). Believe it or not I take most pictures at 640x480 so that I can e-mail them to family. The menus are great. The scene modes are better. The picture quality is Phenomenal! My wife and I just looked at some old shots we took a year ago on a loaner sony mavica, and all I could do is shake my head. There is no comparison. The color and clarity of the 880 is breathtaking. do some more reading... [...] Worth every penny!","Here are some of the pros: 1. Excellent picture quality and colors, even indoors and under fluorescent lights.  2. 2.5x zoom.  3. compact size.  4. presets (\"scene\") mode good for amateurs.<br />And cons... 1. You must (emphasis here) purchase rechargeable batteries separately...2. 8MB CF is small, very small.  3. slight red eye problem (and there is no flash socket).  4. Don't even bother installing the bundled software. It's not worth it. However the basic Nikon View and usb drivers work great and make transfering the pictures a snap.","I just got the camera and I think it is great.  The camera ia easy to use even for someone liek me who doesn't know alot about photography.  The only complaint that I have is the battery life.  But from what I heard, the battery life on all digital cameras is bad","I received my camera and immediately started taking beautiful photos.  The menu is easy to follow and I like the scene option and quality of the display. I had compared it to the Sony DSCS70 with the Carl Zeiss lens and it was about the same in price and features, but I went with Nikon for their optics and menu options thining that I would spend the same amount of money. As well, I ordered the CoolPack for \"all\" coolpix 700, 800 and 900 series cameras.  To my dismay the batteries that come with the CoolPack are not compatible with the 880 and the lens filters are not compatible either (I am assuming a step down ring is needed). I promptly returned it. I ordered a 64MB compact flash card for about $100.  I took about 40 nice photos and kabam - the lithium ion batter was drained (it comes with a disposable battery).  Each battery costs $12-13.  Since I intend on taking many photos, I have opted to spend the extra $120 and order the re-chargeable battery, charger and small case.  This is a hefty add on fee for what all the other digital camera's of the same price range come with standardly.  The autofocus makes a rather loud noise. At first I was worried since it does not sound like it is a smooth moving part inside (lots of friction sounds), but I called tech support and was told this is normal for the camera to make these sounds.  The lady at Nikon was professional and courteous, and hopefully correct in her information!  All in all, I expect to take lots beautiful pictures very easily, but if you are not willing to invest about $1100 including the camera and accessories, then this may not be the camera for you.  If the camera had come with the battery, charger and protective cover/case I would have given this a 5 star review.","As a lifelong technology heat seeker, I'm going against type when it comes to digital cameras. It's just for that kind of money, I want all the kinks out.<br />I couldn't wait to pick it up when I was at the camera store. Feels good in the hand, has the great Nikon optics, takes additional lenses and filters, the controls are easy to handle and the 3.3 megapixel resolution does a superb job.<br />So, what's not to like?<br />First, in this class camera I want to have some more creative lighting options -- so it needs the ability to attach/synch a remote strobe.<br />Then, the battery life is suspect -- and could really get expensive in a hurry. While you can pick up AA batteries anywhere, this camera takes batteries that not everyone carries in case your rechargable battery expires on a big photo day (and what's with the $100 option for a rechargable battery when the regular batteries cost $20 a pop? When you figure in options like the batteries and a bigger-than-8 meg-storage card, the price jumps to $1,000 or higher).<br />Finally, I want to be able to take pictures of my non-stop grandchildren in full motion. Two clerks at the camera store spent 20 minutes trying to capture shots of people walking by the storefront in the mall. No luck. Either it's too hard to figure out or still doesn't can't respond quickly enough to get the pictures in mall-bright conditions.<br />So, I'll continue to buck my lifelong early-adopter pattern and hold out for the camera to give me a wee bit more of what I'm looking for before plunking down close to a thousand bucks.","I have been waiting years for an affordable digital camera that could produce satisfactory prints and am more than satisfied with this product.  The image quality is superb and the camera is a joy to use.  The layout is clean, functional and easy to learn.  The one button review feature is extremely helpful in making quick decisions on keeping a photo.  I shoot a lot from the water and the compact size and light weight make it ideal for traveling.  Nikon has a real winner here.","I have waited over a year to finally buy a digital camera for myself. We use them at work and I have tried several others. Up to now, the image quality has been OK but not something I want to use for family photos...albums, frames, etc. The Nikon 880 takes a major step in quality. I am not technically capable of describing it, I just know that the results are great. I can now use my digital camera instead of my film-based camera and get the same results for 8x10 and smaller and get all the advantages of digital. the biggest advantage is knowing for sure that I have the shot I want before I go home and find out I missed it. If I don't have it, I can retake it immediately. Its great.","I borrowed this camera from a friend to take with me on vacation when my film camera broke.  The camera performed flawlessly and I have printed out a number of absolutely spectacular photos from it.  Very Impressed!"]},{"name":"Olympus E-10","amazon_reviews":["Awesome","The best camera I ever owned.","Works like a charm!

I would recommend a<br />rechargeable battery unit.","I have used the Olympus E-10 continually since 2001. I had owned three previous digital cameras by Olympus but the E-10 was the first model that completely satisfied me. I take photographs for business (technical publishing) and pleasure and mostly use my images in digital form, although I have made satisfying prints up to 16 x 20 inches. I find this camera easy and enjoyable to use and the image quality exceptional. Although newer Olympus high end models have more megapixels and interchangeable lenses, I have not envied them enough to upgrade.<br /><br />Like all high end digital cameras, the E-10 has a host of features that can be a little intimidating to learn. I felt the E-10 was worthy of the effort and I was inspired to design a publication to help other amateurs master the use of this camera. My E-10s are a continual source of enjoyment and I hope others will make the effort to master its use.","I bought my refurbished E-10 online from Olympus.  It has functioned perfectly.  The cost was 1/3 of the price they charged when the E-10 was first introduced.  Since then, the price has continued to decrease as the competition has added megapixels and professionals have moved to DSLR bodies.  This makes the E-10 a bargin for the weekend photographer.  The camera is built like a brick - but a wonderfully ergonomic brick! The optics are fast and sharp and Olympus are famous for their image quality - even if it is \"only\" 4  MP.  The camera is supported by a full range of accessories readily available on Amazon (or eBay) including wide angle and telephoto supplementary lens, cable release, flash, etc. A total system will cost less than the body of a new DSLR.  More important, this is (well was) a professional camera, built for professionals with an imposing presence and total control over the image.  If you think you need those extra pixels ask how many 8 x 10 enlargements you made last year.  If the answer is less than 10 then this could be the perfect digital camera for you - and at a realistic price.","this is the only slr DIGITAL camera, I've had a slr film camera for a few years and could never go back to a point and click camera ever, and i bought a few digital camera before this one but they weren's slr style and the pictures never impressed me at all, basically i dont have much to compare this camera to digital slr wise, but i am VERY happy with the image quality and everything else about the camera","The camera has many nice points. These have been covered in other people's reviews. I will mention the few items that I think are less good:<br />- It is not very good at focusing, especially in less light environment. I had the Olumpus people look at it but they said there was nothing wrong with it.<br />- It is terribly heavy.<br />- It is slow to start up.<br />Dispite the recomendations from Olympus to not use the Microdrive, I have found a somewhat safe way to copy the pictures from the Smartmedia card to the Microdive. In this way, I can take several hundreds of pictures without needing to upload to a computer.<br />My next camera will be a Minolta - also with a Microdrive function.","I've been a serious hobbyist photographer for more than 25 years and this is my sixth digital camera. After looking for more than a few months I settled on the Olympus E-10 for its high quality photographs. There are other cameras with more mega-pixels and more powerful zoom lens but few if any of those will come close to the quality that this camera produces.<br />There are manual controls for everything and that big lens just sucks in the light for great low light pictures. The beam splitter view finder is sweet and the manual zoom allows for working the 4x zoom quickly. I bought the matching F-40 flash unit which integrates with the camera to expose flash pictures very well. The flash also follows the zoom lens shifting from wide-angle to telephoto as the lens is worked.<br />This is a big solid camera that is not for causal snap shots - though when set to the \"program\" mode it can do that. Where this camera will excel is in the hands of someone who can put that big piece of glass, well matched sensor, and manual abilities to work.","I started my DSLR career with this cam. Have a film Leica R series with $15,000 in lenses but wanted to expand horizons. This camera is great. I have had mine for 18 months, still learning new thngs about it, keep the owners manual close. I also purchased the MCON and Telephoto 1.45. Macros are really great with the MCON. Tele is okay but only gives you 200 equivalent which isn't always enough. Some of my photos have been good enough to sell in the local art gallery. Buy this camera if you really want great pictures and a great price. I paid $1200 for mine and now they are down to $700 and more than worth every penny.","I am an amateur who has been taking nature and action photographs with Nikon SLRs for many years. The light is often crummy and my subjects move about. I used an Olympus C-3000 for two years and immediately fell in love with the flat response of the CCD compared to film.  However, that squinchy little rangefinder, and that long pause before the image is actually recorded..  I really found I needed a large bright through-the-lens viewfinder.  However, I was surprised to find that even 3 megapixels was just fine for really sharp 8x10 images unless you had to crop aggressively.<br />For me, the E-10 was just what I needed. 4 megapixels is fine for just about anything I would want to do.  If you really think you need 5, spend $500 more on the E-20. Remember, however, that more pixels means more time to record, play back, or modify each image.  The viewfinder is large and bright and the diopter correction is very positive. Eye relief is good enough to use glasses. Unlike an SLR, the viewfinder light comes from a beam splitter rather than a flip-up mirror. This raises the question of what the lens speed of F2 means, since the beam-splitter will steal some light. There is a built-in viewfinder cover so you won't get stray light coming in when you take remote shots.  The lens is really nice and seemed to have very low flare. The built-in macro focusing feature gets you close enough for anything but documenting periodontal surgery.<br />Understand, though, that this camera is big and heavy compared to most modern digital cameras. Nobody who grew up on SLRs will be surprised, but remember that you are going to have to lug this puppy around for several years. Despite its size and weight, it feels very comfortable, even for a lefty.<br />The E-10 has most of the controls a good SLR would have and several more that are completely beyond a chemical camera. The combination of exposure correction, sharpness and contrast control, and image histogram display really help in those bad light situations.<br />So, a pro might want more pixels and many amateurs will want something smaller and lighter.  However, this camera very nicely fits a significant niche market.","This has been a great camera. The body is largely metal, so there are few plastic parts to break. The battery door is located on the bottom, so batteries can be swapped out even when the camera is mounted on a tripod.<br />The lense is not interchangable, which can be a disadvantage for some, but it ensures that no dust can get into the shutter or behind the lense. I love the dial controls. There are enough dials and buttons on the camera so that the LCD display is not required for most camera settings.<br />There are a few disadvantages to the camera. The shutter speed only goes up to 1/640, and the aperature only goes up to F11, however the aperature can be as shallow as F2.2. Also, as time has worn on, the light meter doesn't seem to perform as well in low light as when I first bought this camera. Don't get me wrong, though. It still does an excellent job. Better than most digital cameras.<br />Overall, I have been quite satisfied with this camera.","I recieved my camera about 4 months ago, and except for a few minor complaints, I have been very happy.  The camera takes excellent pictures, and the manual controls are very easy to use and allow very professional looking results.  Prints from the camera to a P400 Olympus printer look excellent up to 8.5X11 inches (I am sure they would look better on a bigger print, but that is as big as my printer can do).<br />My only complaint in the LCD screen.  It refreshes slowly, and takes quite a long time to preview images.  Also, when zooming in and out on the pictures really takes longer then necessary (from both CF and SM).<br />Just as one final note, although the camera literature does not specify support for the new 512MB CF cards, I use one with no problems.  I have not, however, used a Microdrive as of yet.","Simply put, this camera is a SOLID machine that offers excellent image quality as well as photographic control. Being an SLR, I never used the LCD screen to shoot, which makes it more like using a standard 35mm. Get the battery pack/grip. Without it, the consumption of batteries is tremendous. With it, I easily got 1000 shots before needing a recharge. My major gripe, and the reason I upgraded to a Canon EOS D60, is that it is SLOW. The buffer is inadequate and I always found myself waiting for it to empty to take another shot. Viewing the images on the LCD screen takes forever. And the top shutter speed of 1/650 second is not fast enough.","When I set out to make my camera purchase, I was trying to decide between a Minolta Dimage 7, a Sony DSC-F707, and the Olympus E-10. After holding all three in my hands and shooting with them, there is no comparison -- the E-10 is a camera and feels and works like an SLR body, the Minolta and the Sony are just consumer electronics.<br />E-10 photos in adequate light or with a decent flash system are excellent; resolution is great, noise is present but when exposure is good it is very gaussian and thus mimics good film grain perfectly. Though the E-10's sensor is \"only\" 4 megapixels, the lens is bright and perfectly matched to the frame; when you're looking at the 8x10 prints, it's very hard to tell the difference between the E-10 and the 5 megapixel cameras on the market. Color reproduction is very true, which means again much more film-like, but possibly flat for people accustomed to consumer digicams (which tend to try to make everything look \"better than real life\" rather than \"like real life\"). If you want to oversaturate, you can always do it afterward in Photoshop, GIMP, etc.<br />Some user reviews have complaied about the E-10 autofocus, but there's nothing wrong with it. The E-10 has an SLR-style AF system; this is not a \"focus-free\" camera. You must pay attention at least to the AF target area and focus lock, and if you're not shooting in 'P' mode also to the depth of field and shutter speed. Many users who complain about getting out of focus shots with the E-10 are coming from low-end \"focus-free\" point and shoot film or digital cameras and don't know how to properly use the AF system on a camera like this one, nor how to adjust for the other variables.<br />Positives: camera looks like a USB hard drive to the computer, no additional software or hardware needed to transfer images; adjustable quality settings -- SHQ, HQ, and SQ can each be user-defined to any number of resolution and compression settings; both CompactFlash AND SmartMedia slots and you can use both at once; excellent build quality -- my E-10 could survive a war; manual focus and zoom rings for rapid, accurate control; raw mode for highest quality shooting; histogram for checking exposure; all controls are locking controls and are on the camera body -- you won't have to be navigating menus all day while you shoot; settings panel on top is lit (nice touch!) for shooting in darkness; long tripod exposures in low light are stunning, noise-free, and very sharp; bright TTL viewfinder, not an electronic viewfinder like you'll find on some \"SLR-like\" digital cameras; easy-to-access rapid white balance measurement system; zero shutter lag -- you can get four shots off in one second; lit status display below the glass in the viewfinder just as you'd expect with any SLR so you can shoot, change settings, shoot, change settings again, without ever moving your eye from the shot.<br />Negatives: noise becomes a problem in \"pushed\" (underexposed, then gamma-corrected) shots -- no \"ISO-boost\" trickery with the E-10; body and lens are heavy enough to cause strap-burn after a few hours; inability to reliably use microdrives; must be sent back to Olympus for firmware upgrades; maximum shutter of 1/640s can be a limitation in sunlight or when shooting action; only four shots in continuous mode before having to wait for buffer flush; focus screen can be difficult to see accurately; no depth of field preview; RAW images are not optimized/compressed and are thus 7MB(!) each, TIFF are 12MB(!!).<br />This is a great camera for the enthusiast or the professional needing a backup or studio camera. On the other hand the E-10 is probably too much work (settings, weight, additional storage requirements of 4 megapixels, more complex AF) if you just want occasional shapshots or a thought-free, unobtrusive vacation camera. When all is said and done, the E-10 is without competition...","THE CAMERA SPEAKS FOR ITSELF..A WONDERFUL PROFESSIONAL<br />DIGITAL CAMERA IN EVERY RESPECT.  HOWEVER COMPETITION<br />AT EBAY AND OTHERS ARE FOUR TO FIVE HUNDRED LESS FOR OPENING BIDS.  JACK FALLON  I AM A SERIOUS BUYER AND SPEND THOUSANDS ON EBAY MONTHLY. WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE SALES..BUT HAVE TO GO WHERE THE PRICE IS RIGHT!!!","I hate it when a bad company makes a great product.  The E-10 is my camera of choice, although I could afford to step up to full pro.  The lenses are excellent, and don't let the fact that you can't interchange them bother you.  It protects the CCD, which bites dust and can't be cleaned except by a tech.<br />Unfortunately, Olympus has among the worst customer service attitudes I've ever encountered.  They make no secret out of the fact that they don't want to talk to you.  They leave you on hold listening to a recording that encourages you to use their website instead.  They even charge you extra if you choose to order by phone.  Trouble is, they don't answer their email, so if you have a question before you buy, forget it.<br />They also talk to you like you're a dog, transfer your call in the middle of your sentence, and just generally act like you have a lot of nerve to interrupt their day.<br />The hot shoe cover on my E-10 was loose when the camera arrived, and eventually it came off and was lost.  I contacted them about obtaining another, and they gave me totally useless advice about where to get one, and acted like they'd rather be eating road kill than talking to me.<br />Will I buy the E-20?  Before I contacted Olympus, I'd have said yes with no hesitation.  Now, I don't know.  I love the E-10, but I hate to reward bad customer service.","I've read a lot of reviews on this camera and I can't find anything bad about it from anyone who knows anything about photography. There are those who say the camera is heavy..That's a plus , not a minus when you're trying to keep it still. There are those who say that the focus is out. Olympus will gladly fix it if it is in fact out, but before you say it's out learn how to focus. Even in autofocus mode you should learn the tricks. Overall the quality of the camera is nothing short of excellent. Dual Storage media is a BIG plus. Picture quality is among the best digitals out today. The Built-in Flash is probably the best of all digitals. Lens construction and quality is above average. The F2.0 is a real pleasure. Just think, where can you get a 400mm F2.0 lens by adding an attachment. Olympus E10 that's where...The controls are all outside so there's no messing around with the menu. They are all at your finger tips. This is one of the best ergonomic designs that I have seen in a camera. The viewfinder displays all the important info about the shot. There are controls for bracketing, compensation, AE lock, macro mode, Spot, Center weighted and EPS Multi pattern meetering etc..<br />What else...Well there was some small talk about noise and dead pixels...I never experienced either the noise or the dead pixels (Just lucky I guess)but maybe some of the talk was a lot of bull....<br />In any case, if you're moving from a film to a digital, this is the one. The camera will feel good in your hands and the results will be nothing less than spectacular. I know, I had a Nikon F100 and that camera was the best 35mm film camera that I ever owned.","This camera is everything that the other reviews claim.  I now use the E-10 instead of my 35mm SLR for customized shots and don't really miss the 35mm's flexibility.  Built-in flash is quite capable (other than the short distance from the lens).  Battery consumption is excellent -- batteries last several days to a week of pretty heavy vacation shooting (if you don't go overboard on using the LCD screen and do remember to turn the camera off promptly).  Get the rechargeable AA NiMHs.  The CR-V3s last very well, but are quite expensive.  Alkalines will work in a pinch (i.e., there's an advantage to the standard battery form factor), but don't last.<br />The positives have been said many times here already.  Just don't focus on the few negatives that I will mention!<br />Setting up a customized shot (field-of-view, exposure compensation, etc.) takes a fair bit longer than on my 35mm because of the time to walk through the menus.<br />... and, this camera is heavy!  That was obvious from the spec's (most people consider a 2 lb 35mm to be a heavy camera), so I knew that going in.  That's not even considering the excellent, but also heavy external flash.<br />I have not yet tried my filter collection, but a lot of filter functions can be accomplished by digital post-processing.<br />I'm very happy with it after 5 months of good usage.","I own several Nikon 35mms, a Kodak DC 260 and the E-10. Most of the time I carry the E-10 as my primary camera and use the DC260 for point and shoot.<br />I've seen some criticisms about the E-10s auto focus in low light. This condition exists in most digital cameras not just the E-10. The only real negative that I can complain about is the TTL view finder. It's just a little too close to the body. To protect the LCD I use a clear Palm Pilot screen overlay. This keeps grease and dirt off of the screen and provides a scratch resistant surface.<br />On the plus side, it feels just like my Nikon N80. The overall performance of the E-10 has exceeded all of my expectations. I've had the camera for 2 months and have already taken over 600 pictures. I love this camera. If you want the most bang for the buck in a digital camera and plan on taking a lot of pictures, then this is the camera to buy. I suggest that you keep a UV filter on the lense at all times. The only other filer that you might want is a circular polarizing filter. The camera will try to color balance pictures taken with any enhancing filters so save your money. The White Balance feature on the E-10 is great. I've had some pictures where the colors seem a little flat particulary on cloudy overcast days. By changeing the WB setting, I've been able to correct this condition most of the time. It just takes practice.<br />I use both CF and SmartMedia in this camera and have no problems at all. Having had previous expirence with IBM microdrives, I wouldn't recommend that they be used. First of all they are delicate and don't like to be bounced around, Secondly they are power hungry. I wouldn't expect battery life to be too good using a microdrive. Besides Olympus doesn't support the microdrive on the E-10. It is supported on the new E-20.<br />The only warning that I have for prospective internet buyers is if the price seems to be too good, it might be. Some sources are selling a European version of this camera that is not covered by the Olympus warrenty in the US. Check the Olympus web site for more info on this.<br />Anyone interested in a great digital camera should consider this one for sure.","I find myself carrying my E-10 with me everywhere. It is a joy to hold and shoot with.  I started with a canon s20 a year ago and stepped up to a \"real\" camera this summer.  Sure only 1 in 100 pictures are worth keeping, but that is because of me not the camera.  My photography can grow almost without limits with this camera.  As I pick up skills, I won't hit a capability limit with the E-10.","I have owned mt E-10 for about 3 months now.  I am a novice photographer and started out with the Olympus 3000.  I love the E-10 as it takes great photos in spite of lack of experience but it does seem to have some drawbacks.  For one, the auto focus does seem to have trouble especially in any type of low light.  I mostly use the manual focus.  In group shots you may find some focus problems.  I would recommend nothing smaller than a 128mb memory card even though I used a 256.  At the resolution the camera is capable of I take only SHQ or Tiff shots.  Lithium batteries actually work quite a while in this camera.<br />The manual that comes with the camera is quite easy to use and understand.  While the camera does come with lots of bells and whistles, it's not too difficult to understand most of them in a short period of time.  I did find it was very easy to take blurry shots with just the slightest movement of the camera during the shot.  Use a tripod when its reasonable to use one.  If not, HOLD STILL.  Use the LCD display only if necessary as it sucks the life out of the batteries.  Almost impossible to use it during bright sunlight.  Also its too close to the rear eye piece so always expect smudges on it from your face.<br />The camera is quite heavy but it is constructed very very well.  The lense is non-removeable and this has been somewhat of a critcism but I find the lense on this camera is great.  I do recommend the U.V. filter and leave it on all the time.  A replaced filter is a heck of a lot cheaper than a replaced lense.<br />As far as service from Olympus.  I actually damaged my E-10 (dropped the darn thing) and sent if off to Olympus.  (Keep the original box).  It was fixed, no charge, and returned to me in 7 days and it works perfectly.  That I was impressed with.<br />In conclusion.  Is this a professional camera as touted by others? Naw, not really.  But for the money it's a close as you are going to get.  Most of the other professional digital cameras are 5k to 30k.  With this camera and some practice, you can take pitures that rival a pro.  Of course, a good photo printer is necessary.  I am an idiot when it comes to photography and the camera takes great shots in spite of me.  I do recommend this camera highly.","Ok... I have had this camera about a year now....Am still having a little trouble with low lighting situations, those where one can't use flash... but have learned some tricks....hold it steady or use a tripod!......or you need to up the ISO. I love that you can transfer files from one media to the other(ie smart to compact flash).<br />The 4 megapixels produces great details and a variety of print sizes. Overall I am very impressed by this camera, I use it to take portrait and wedding pictures on the weekends and thus far it is producing great pictures! It has all of the features I need to adjust my photos the way I want as well as a program mode when I want it. Best of all I like that it feels like a regular SLR camera, ok a little heavier then my canon rebel, but none the less otherwise works and looks very similar. Haven't found any other negatives yet, although I did buy rechargeable batteries right away. Overall I think its an excellent camera and the price is getting better. Enjoy!","When you take group pictures, I foud problems with the autofocus.<br />The rest is excelent.","The E-10 is not perfect, yet it is still the best-designed product I have used. I'm not limiting this claim to photographic equipment. Car, toaster, pencil, whatever, this is the best product I have ever purchased. The toughtful design goes beyond technology into the realm of art.<br />I especially enjoy using the E-10 with Olympus' lithium-polymer battery pack. It gives the camera extra heft, and provides an extra shutter release button.<br />Some have complained about the low top shutter speed of 1/640 of a second. Many of the staff photographers at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway use the E-10, and have no problem shooting race cars at 1/640. You have to pan in these situations. Several of the IMS photographers have told me they much prefer the E-10 over the Canon EOS D-30 for high-speed subjects, and the D-30 costs a thousand dollar more, and doesn't come with lenses.<br />An impressive E-10 feature is the camera's ablity to take sharp photos in low-light situations. I have taken numerous clear, focused photos at 1/8, handheld. Autofocus is a unreliable in the dark, but if you crank the diopter on the eyepiece all the way clockwise manual focus is not a problem. I also suggest trying to focus using the LCD screen in low light.<br />The more I use this camera, the more charmed I am by it. Every time I pick it up I get a good feeling about the photos I'm about to take. The E-10 works with you, not against you. Use and and you will become a better photographer.","This is an extremely cool camera. Being a photography amateur, I have to disagree with another reviewer who said this camera was not for beginners. I've learned more about photography with this camera than with the dozen or so film cameras I've owned before.<br />Believe it or not, this camera will make you a good photographer. The pros will surely laugh at this statement, but if you are a beginner, you will be simply amazed at the quality of the pictures you'll get out of this thing. Coupled with the P-400 dye-sub printer, you'll blow people's minds with the quality output.<br />I do have to second some of the negatives mentioned by other reviewers. Auto-focus in dim-light is nearly impossible and quite frustrating. Consider adding the FL-40 flash (with additional rangefinder) to correct this problem.  I couldn't agree more with the guy who said the Olympus semi-hard case wasn't good. Another thing I don't think anyone mentioned was the close proximity of the eyepiece to the camera. It would have been nice if they'd extended that piece farther back or inset the LCD display. You'll often find yourself  wiping nose prints off your LCD.<br />One review mentioned the poor support for the MicroDrive. Olympus states that the E-10 is not compatible with the MicroDrive. While you can get it to work, it's just not worth the hassle and it will quickly drain the batteries. I bought a couple of 256K CompactFlash cards and each one gives me 96 pictures at the highest JPEG setting.<br />Olympus seems like a good company so far, but I was quite unimpressed with how they market this camera on their own website. You won't find it easy to find options for this camera at their E-10 page. The info on the camera itself is pretty sketchy as well. I spent a lot of time comparing makes and models and found this camera to be at the top of its class. After owning and using it for a few months now,  I know I made the right choice. Overall, this is a great camera and while it has a few shortfalls, they pale in comparison to the features and quality of this unit. If you buy one, you will not be disappointed.","I've completely switched from emulsion to digital because of this camera.  Not for the novice (although would take great pictures).  Coupled with a FL-40 flash and stroboframe bracket make this the envy of professionals.","This is my 6th digicam and likely my last (for a while)  :-).  I started with a Kodak D460, moved thru three Olympus Camera's including the D400, C2000, and C2500, then the Nikon's: the 950 and the 990.  I must say that I really enjoyed the C2000 and the the Nikon's the most.  I continue to think of the 990 as a superb digicam whose macro ability is without peer.  Having said that, I thoroughly enjoy the E-10!  From the moment I picked it up, I think I was hooked.  Ergonomically, the camera is beyond approach.  All the important functions are at your fingertips (literally) and none are buried in menus.  Second, the image qualtiy, color and resolution are amazing.  Every bit as good and in some cases even better than the 990, although it cannot get as close ( even with the add-on macro lens)It is also very quick, shot to shot, manual focus, Compact flash and Smart Media, I could go on an on.  For me, it represents the next step from a point and shoot.  It gives me the ability to take pictures and feel like I have all the control in the world.  It is a superb instrument.  It is, like others have pointed out, not without shortcomings.  The picture review is way too slow when compared to any other digicam I've owned.  Is this a showstopper-absolutely not.  They say fixed lens is a problem.  For me, I knew it was fixed when I bought it.  I knew what it was capable of alone and with the attachments.  Max shutter speed too, has been cited as problematic at only 1/640.  Guess what?  After 6,000 pics, I haven't had one missed shot because of slow shutter speed.  Besides, I don't take pictures of car racing.  Anyway, suffice it to say that this is one great camera and I haven't regretted my purchase once!","I've had a Minolta SLR for the past 10 years and been very happy with it, but after buying the my \"other half\" a Canon Digital Elph, I found the ability to immediately review photographs compelling. So, I looked for a digital SLR.<br />Olympus has hit the price/performance sweet spot with this camera. Competitive digital SLRs cost 50% more than the E10 for the body alone -- i.e. before you've bought any lenses. However, I was concerned that the E-10 would be an adequate replacement for my film SLR. So, The E-10 passed with flying colors.<br />What's good about this camera: terrific image quality, great lens (f2.0-f2.6!), all the control you could want (white balance, focus, zoom, exposure, flash), support for compact flash and smart media, and ability to take up to 4 shots in rapid succession, easy upload of images to a PC, Adobe Photoshop LE included and good battery life on Olympus NiMH AA batteries.<br />I took scores of pictures every day and was generally pleased with the results. The camera functions well in program mode, but immediate image review on the camera enables you to use more control if you don't get the shot you need. And with digital, you can just keep on taking shots until you get it right without worrying about film.<br />The ability to take 4 shots in rapid succession is useful when trying to capture spontaneous events -- like the procession of flag throwers (a Tuscan tradition that goes back over 700 years) out for a practice early one Sunday in Siena. Other digital cameras have big problems with both \"shutter lag\" (time from pressing the button to capturing the image) and the interval between shots -- especially with a 4 megapixel CCD where images take longer to write to flash.<br />I made extensive use of a polarizing filter to cut glare under the Tuscan sun, and the images came out with strong colors as a result. The E10 seems a little \"flatter\" in its color balance than Canon cameras, but color saturation can be easily tweaked in Photoshop if this is a problem for any given image.<br />I never managed to run the Olympus AA NiMH batteries (purchased separately) flat during a day's shooting, so camera power consumption seems to be excellent -- short battery life is a killer for many digital cameras.<br />The lens is very impressive. It has a great zoom range, and as the camera was designed for digital from the ground up there are none of the multiplying effects of film cameras converted for digital use (e.g. Canon D30). This means that the E10 has great short-range capability as well as telephoto without having to switch lenses. This is very important if you want to travel light, as I did.<br />What's not-so-good: problems with IBM Microdrive, autofocus requires care to avoid misfocus errors, viewfinder image location leads to orientation errors, general operation could be a lot faster, and the optional Olypus case is poor.<br />The E10 requires the photographer to carefully monitor whether it has successfully locked on the subject. Early on, I got several poorly focused shots because the AF didn't focus on the subject. It's easy to miss this in the viewfinder or on the LCD image preview -- you only find out when you get home... However, once you learn to watch for mistaken AF lock, it is possible to re-focus and avoid this. Still, after Minolta's exemplary AF system, this was an unpleasant surprise.<br />I also used an IBM Microdrive with my E10, but discovered that it does not work properly. I would be able to take several photographs, and then the camera would suddenly complain of flash card errors. It's easy to miss candid shots when you're wondering why the camera isn't working, then realizing there's a flash error, switching to smart media... so the Microdrive went back. Get a 256MB flash card instead.<br />The viewfinder image is large and oddly focused -- it's easy to tilt the camera about a degree and not notice -- until you get to image review. This can be fixed in Photoshop, but it's annoying to have to fix it.<br />Finally, the Olympus feels slower than many point-n-shoot cameras, and this is likely down to the embedded processor used in the camera. It takes several seconds before an image can be previewed, and it is slow to move around in image preview mode. Also, it seems to take a long time to compress an image and store it to flash. The 4 image buffer dramatically reduces the impact of this, but not entirely -- especially when you want to take one photo and see how it came out straight away.<br />Finally, don't buy Olympus' case for the E10. It is very cumbersome and you'll end up wishing you never brought it. I left it at home or in the car most days. You cant open up the case and leave it hanging off the camera -- it gets in your way. That means you have to totally remove the camera from the case and either put it down, stuff it in a bag or squash it under your arm while you try to take photographs.<br />The net is that I can't see why I'd go back to a film SLR. Although the Olympus E10 has its quirks, and Microdrive incompatibility is a drawback, it is a very good digital camera at an excellent price point for the value you receive. Olympus really doesn't have any competition for the money.","I was anxious about paying so much for a digital camera.  But after looking for a couple of months I bought the E-10 because of its form factor and the relatively high resolution of the images.  I have been using the camera for a couple of weeks and almost everything about it is terrific.  The extra lenses, especially telephoto and macro let you capture photos of just about everything you can do with an SLR.  The features are more or less accessible by the physical controls all over the camera.  Some of them are novel, but once you experience them (opening the flash, turning on the menu) they are pretty easy to use.  I thought the two form factors for image storage well silly at first, but it allows you to load your photos into almost all other devices (printers).  The only difficulties I had were based on the problems associated with managing the images and finding a USB driver.","I'm an amateur photographer (at best) and bought this camera on a whim after getting my bonus... Yikes ! the second i bought it i thought i made a really extravagant purchase and thought i would regret it.  So now it's 3 months later and I love it.... It was worth the money. I've sent many pictures to be developped (ofoto.com) and the quality is awesome, Especially once you figure out how to use the cameras features. (read the manual, your pictures will be much better.).  Buy it , you won't regret it.<br />PS: It is 400$ cheaper on other websites (that is where i bought it).","I'm sorry, but it's true.<br />I've been shooting professionally with this rig for about 4 months now.  I have the Nikon D1, but this camera is the first out of my bag.  It gives so much.<br />One thing to consider is that this outstanding camera is currently in a class by itself.  There just isn't another one like it.<br />Let me just comment on the \"noise\".  There is some.  This is also a bone that many have been chewing on ever since the E-10 came out.  But, I read everything I can about this product.  I participate on professional message boards.  I have access to many pro-grade digital cameras, and I know a lot of people who use the E-10.  The consensus - the noise is not a problem.<br />The 640th of a second top shutter speed is odd; I'll give you that.  But I have had little reason to exceed this speed - even to my own surprise.  The first argument is that you'll tend to over-expose in bright sunlight.  Well, get a neutral density filter for 30 bucks - problem solved.  The second, I can't use it in sports shoots.  My answer to that is, well you shouldn't have purchased this camera for sports in the first place - Oly's E-100 is better suited for that. It takes 15 frame bursts, and has a whopper of a zoom on it, plus a progressive scan CCD that rings in at 1.5-megapixels. The E-10 uses the interlaced CCD at 4.1-megapixels.  It's just a whole different animal.  And, honestly, I've shot sporting events with mine, and there are no problems to report.  You just have to make certain allowances.<br />All in all, you buy this camera, You Won't Regret It!<br />Five Big Fat Stars!","Decided to splurge on the E-10 a few weeks back.  Well worth the price.  This is my 3rd digicam.  Started with a basic HP, upgraded to an Olympus D-600.  All have been fun, but this is the first that has been good enough to retire the film based ones for me.  Easy to use right out of the box.  I have it loaded with the 32 mb Smartmedia it comes with as well as a 132 mb Compact Flash.  It can carry a lot of pictures on board.  Absolutely no buyers remorse with this one !","I use the Olympus E-10 with the Olympus CAMEDIA P-400 Digital Color Printer. I find that people can not tell the difference between digital and standard SLR film. Converted to Black and White the pictures are as good as taken by Studio Professional.","I'm sorry faithful fans of the Camedia E-10, but I must ruin the 5-star reputation of this particular digital camera. I hate to be such a party pooper, so I'll start with the good stuff, and thus, tell you all the good things that earned the 4 stars from me. First, on a superficial level, the physical design of the camera is magnificent. This camera is faithful to most SLR designs, and in my opinion, is currently the most stylish look out of all the cameras out there--including the Nikon D1. I particularly like the aluminum exterior. When it's a cold morning and your mind is completely rested, pulling that camera out of its leather case is where I receive a lot of my motivation in the morning--I don't drink coffee. To feel that cold, heavy weight in my hands makes me feel that I have a high quality, well-made camera.  Second, the features are excellent, in that most of the major functions can be adjusted manually, opposed to looking through the LCD screen to set a specific function, as in most other digital cameras, like the Nikon Coolpix series, for example. My favorite feature is the manual zoom. Regular digital cameras like the Sony Cybershot F505V with automatic zoom are too sensitive. Hence, with a manual zoom, not only does it have that SLR feel, it gives the photographer much more control. Third, the E-10 has 4.1 megapixels, but honestly, there are only 3.7 that are actually used. But still, at least the images aren't interpolated. And I still love the detail in each image.  Fourth, of course, the SLR feature is always a plus as far as accuracy goes in taking pictures. Always using the LCD screen to take pictures on my other non-SLR digital cameras always dissatisfies me for many obvious reasons.  Fifth, the 4X zoom is pretty hot, in use with the awesome 3X telephoto lens that you can get on this sit...  Using the telephoto lens, this will give you 12X, and that's great compared to the other less-expensive cameras. Slightly going off tangent, I must also say that Olympus has a good selection of accessories, although they're really hard to find all in one place and are usually on back order. The macro lens particularly impresses me.  Sixth, the price is excellent.  I would buy it, simply because this camera breaches into the professional category, opposed to the simpler point-and-shoot digital cameras. However, the Nikon Coolpix 990 is a good compromise, going beyond the simple point-and-shoot limitation. And lastly, I can't forget the lens. This is my favorite feature. This camera takes superb night pictures--the best I've ever seen. And in my opinion, from the reviews I've read on certain other digital cameras I haven't personally tried yet, I think that the night pictures on this camera are the best on the market. I took a picture in an extremely low-light situation. We're talking about midnight on a barely litted residential neighborhood. The camera produced pictures that looked as though it were dawn.  Now for the bad stuff about this camera: First, there is some noise on the pictures--enough to get most people slightly annoyed. The worst pictures were ones taken inside my house under adequate incandescent lighting, without a flash. The pictures looked as though there were electronic bacteria on the painting on the wall. In other cases, such as outdoor pictures with good lighting, the noise lessens, but is still apparent, even at low ISO. But still, for adequate lighting, I think the camera should still perform well. But still, one must ask, what happens if someone wants to take pictures inside a dim museum? Indeed, this is the most flawed feature, in my opinion.  Second, the color of the images has a good and bad side. The colors are too neutral, which makes the picture look bland. However, this is a good feature for the photographer that wants consistent-looking, real pictures. But in my opinion, the pictures look too real, almost mundane. There will be no good and bad surprises, when viewing these pictures, in my opinion. Third, the built-in lens also has its ups and downs. The good part is that you don't have to worry about dust and other blemishes getting on your lens. And trust me, that happens easily. The bad part is that, if you have a load of lenses that are dying to cross the film-bound SLR to the digital SLR camera, you're going to be disappointed and curse 'til your front tooth flies loose. This is absolutely a necessity to know for the more experienced photographer.  And lastly, the fastest shutter speed is contemptible; it is 1/640th of a second. This can be somewhat fixed with a 62mm neutral-density filter, however. Without it, on a really bright day, the pictures come out overexposed--I don't know what Olympus was thinking here. And of course, taking motion pictures is another small problem worth noting.  That's all folks! And remember, positive features are great to know, because we all want quality, but the negative features are what we NEED to know--they bring us back to reality and have us regret most of the junk we buy. Good luck in future purchases!","Having worked as a 4x5 and 6x7 studio photographer for over 25 years, i have ventured into the digital realm with great skepticism. Superlatives don't exist for how pleased I was when I tried the E10. A freind loaned me his, actually he had to force it on me, for a family trip to DisneyWorld, and I didn't even use it till the last day we were there! Reluctantly on the last day, I decided to spend the morning trying it out. Well, I made 4 trips back to the room to download the card, and finally bought 4 more cards early in the afternoon so I could shoot faster.  A thrill to work with, great images, and more control than most of my 35mm cameras. The ability to manually set color temperature is like having a studio, a refrigerator full of film, and several light meters all with you at DisneyWorld!!!! Bottome line, if you are SERIOUS about photography, or earn part or all of your living via photography, this is a bargain. You will not regret it. Only drawback for amatuers, you must be able to use at the very least Adobe Photoshop LE, as the images are huge and you'll have to learn new digital terms like RAW and compressed images. But it's worth it!!","I noted a review that stated that the IBM Microdrive was not supported, but I bought it for this camera and have used it to store pictures and downloaded to my Gateway Laptop.  It holds more than 320 pictures at a very resonable quality.","This is a brilliant camera which has made the transfer from film to digital easy. Everything is in the right place, it functions like an SLR and getting used to the digital electronic aspects was very straightforward after taking a deep breath to read the manual, which turned out to be far shorter than I expected.  (The thickness is accounted for by the several different languages in it).<br />I use the E10 for a magazine I produce and the results are tremendous and significantly better than pictures I receive from people who use the much more expensive Nikon D1.<br />This is where I need some technical assistance. I am experiencing a problem when I transfer images from the compact flash card to a Macintosh through a card reader.<br />On a 64mb card which should store 23 shots at SHQ compression I am able to store 12 pictures safely and read them.  If there are more than this number a message will appear on the desktop saying there is a fault on the card and some of the data may be lost.  Sometimes it comes up with an error type 39.<br />It will download the first 12 pictures stored but it an error message appears for any over this number. I have managed to get round this problem by copying the pictures I cannot retrieve by copying them to the smart media card and reading that onto the Mac.<br />When I have taken the card to the dealer and look at it on their PC, a number of files which I assume Macintosh has written to the card appear - Volume Settings Folder, Desktop DB, Desktop DF.","Incredible! Super! The first pro dg camera ever! It takes the best pictures and there's no competition. The quality is absolutely outstanding. Be prepared to spend twice the amount of the camera...<br />PROS : -Very sturdy, well designed body<br />-All the manual controls you'll ever need<br />-Impressive night and macro ability<br />-SmartMedia and CompactFlash Type II slots<br />-Ultra-fast shooting speeds<br />-Handy backlit LCD info display and swiveling LCD<br />-Ability to preview shots on LCD as well as viewfinder (a first for an SLR digital)<br />-Manual zoom(sweet!)<br />-There are lots of equipment for this camera<br />CONS :<br />-Lens not removable<br />-Somewhat sluggish in menus and playback mode<br />-Disappointing LCD quality<br />-IBM Microdrive not supported<br />TIFF mode is just awesome, but the average size is... 11,3 megs. So it`s 11 pics on a 128 meg card. This is THE camera right now for the pros. The super fast shots are incredible, it takes jpg pics like lightning. What can I say else?","Ok - Wow.<br />In digital photography, all you need is good photo-editing software (the E-10 comes with Adobe Photoshop LE) and a good printer - no eye-irritating chemicals and hours alone in the dark, like with film photography!  Oh ya, and a good camera!<br />Using the E-10 is functioning on a whole different plane than anything I've used before (digitally, Kodak and Sony in the $800 - $900 range).  The control is total.  The product is eye-popping.  What pictures!  I'm producing 13x19 inch prints of amazing clarity.  And although there is still quite a bit of effort involved - the comfort level and the amount of ultimate control over the product is astounding.  And it all starts with the E-10.<br />To the hand, the fit and feel are unmistakably that of a 35mm SLR.  Of course, there is no f-ring, and no gnarled knob dedicated to shutter speed control - too bad, I thought at first.  But with some adjustment to thinking, there is an easy (actually, easier!), total control of these functions - and so much more.  The zoom and focus rings are the smoothest I've ever used (and I have a couple of lenses for my 35mm that cost more than this camera).<br />I also have the 0.8x and the 1.45x lens attachments, for wide and telephoto (or 28mm and 200mm, respectively, in a 35mm format camera).  Lens extenders exaggerate chromatic aberrations, flares and distortions - and they certainly reduce the speed of the lens fairly dramatically, among other things.  Regarding the Camedia extenders, though there is a reduction in speed, it's absolutely negligible.  And for image quality, I performed some tests photographing newspaper (a great test pattern, believe it, or not) and found nothing to complain about - quite the opposite.  This is really good stuff.  Not perfect, but very, very good.  The quality of the lens on the camera, on the other hand, may as well be perfect.  Similar, but more precise tests performed against this lens just made me smile.  There are some flares and barreling under certain circumstances, but nothing - absolutely nothing to complain about.  The contrast and brightness-uniformity (condensing) of the image are as good as you can get without spending a lot, like on some of Canon's Flourite lenses.<br />Overall, the experience is just great.  The designers thought of everything.  This E-10 is easier to use, and fits the hand better than any professional grade camera I've ever used.<br />Just a couple more notes:  The optical viewfinder is bright.  The shutter release is perfect for handheld, low shutter speed shots in that it requires only a very light touch (but there is good travel to prevent premature release).  The CCD is noise-free at any contrast (some owners claim noise at higher contrast settings, but I haven't experienced this.  Perhaps, Olympus had dealt with this by the time I purchased mine).  The LCD monitor really comes in handy with its multi-position feature - in making waist level and over-head shots.<br />Olympus suggests that this camera will eliminate the need to ever return to film format cameras.  I definitely agree.  Digital photography really is a revolution.  And this particular camera really is the beginning of the revolution as far as cost/quality combination is concerned.<br />This is a great camera.","Purchased the E-10 after buying and returning other brands that originally were comperable in price but on sale.  From the moment I opened the owners manual, I knew the E-10 would be a camera I would keep.<br />The manual was very easy to understand giving you a discription of a feature as well as all related pages that offered more information.  Within a matter of moments, I was able to set the camera up and start taking pictures.<br />The only problem I incured was when I went to download pictures to my PC (a problem I had with other brands).  Unlike the other manufacturers, one phone call to Olympus and my problem was resolved in less than 20 minutes.<br />If you want an easy to use camera that takes exceptional pictures, then this is the camera for you.  Now I anxiously await the wide angle and tele-photo lenses for even more fun","Have only had the E-10 for one week but have tried several photo shoots and what results. Have enlarged photos with excellent re- sults. This camera is easy to use and easy to download. Pictures are easy to review while still in the camera and easy to delete the ones not wanted. This camera comes with a 32mb smart card and since it will hold either smart card or compact flash I added a 64mb compact flash card and being able to hold both cards at the same time and easy to switch between the two cards is a delight. Would recommend this camera to anyone looking for outstanding photos."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix 4900 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["This camera has all of the adjustments a person could want. It's very similar to my older SLR cameras that use film, only much less expensive to operate since the images are electronic.  There are several automatic settings, or the aperature can be set manually while leaving the speed automatic.  The speed can be set while leaving the aperature on automatic, or bot can be set manually. There are several levels of picture quality.  You can have lots of pixels for high quality, but fewer pics on the memory card, or choose lower quality and more pics, or somewhere in-between.  Lots of flexibility.  Cons:  The camera had a defect that causes it not to be able to connect to a computer.  I had to buy a card reader separately, which is a hassle, but it works (requites removing the memory card from the camera and connecting the reader to the computer).  The battery is a special unit and doesn't last long, but is ok for my needs.  The memory cards are of an older design and don't have anywhere the capacity of the cards the newer cameras use.  The bottom line:  I got a very flexible camera for far less that the price of a new electronic SLR.  The picture quality and flexibility are excellent.  The seller could have been more open about its up-loading problem.","If You thought Chung's review was late, mine is much later, just got this camera off EBAY for $50.00, seller said the batteries only lasted 3-5 mins and included two spare NP 80 batteries, the wide angle lens and adapter and a nice case for $50.00.

Fuji probably discontinued this model though because the battery only lasts about 45 minutes to an hour if used with the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). If you use the EVF (Electronic View Finder) the battery will last longer, the LCD just looks cooler is all.

Oh well we shall see.","My partner and I both purchased this camera.  It actually produces better resolution (2,400 x 1,800 pixels) than 5.4 MB cameras that cost twice as much. In addition, it has an auto mode that enables my wife to take picutures without the complications of adjusting an SLR.  Other features that I like: Electronic View Finder, Auto/Man Focus, Auto/Man/Custom White Balance, Continuous Shooting, 6x optical with 3.75 digital zoom.  The resolution is so good, that you can zoom in on the individual pores of a persons face.  As a result, it is  excellent for medical imaging and I have used it in the operating room with outstanding results.  The only thing is that you need either a photo printer or a color laser printer with high resolution to fully appreciate the high quality of these images.","I am in charge of a design team in a large corporation. We needed a digital camera due to the expensive development. Haven't seen or tried any camera better than this one. Its really fantastic. Its very easy to use, plus the quality is outstanding. One minor problem though - max aperture time is 2 seconds.","The things I don't like are:<br />1> zooming range is not enough<br />2> not good for close shoots (< 1.5m)<br />3> slow focus in auto mode<br />4> short battary life (in LCD mode)<br />5> when you push 'shoot' button, you never make sure it is on focus only or already take a pic.<br />All others are more than good.","Bought this camera about three weeks ago, and have zero problems with it.  Pictures in automatic mode are perfect, and scene specific modes work well too.  The picture quality is fantastic - my wife is using Nikon Coolpix 995,... and my Fuji takes better pictures.  It also has an auto-timer, TV out, macro mode, the 6x optical zoom works great, and can film 160 sec films.  This camera is lacking these following features which I would add in a perfect world - sound for films, no web cam capability, and comes with only a 16mb card. Buy yourself a 128mb smartmedia card and an extra battery and your set. Takes professional quality photos.","I did a fair amount of research before replacing my current digital camera. This camera is great. It has the \"Auto\" setting for my wife and the 35mm type manual features I wanted.. It takes great picture. I would HIGHLY Recommend it to those who want a good digital camera with advanced features..","I've had my FinePix 4900 for half a year now and I'll be keeping it a lot longer! [Now I've had it for nearly seven years,... still works fine, still delivers!]<br /><br />It is the first digital that I've bought, and I specifically chose one with full exposure control to use in photographing small zoological specimens. I also have the wide angle lens adapter and a set of close-up lenses, plus a few filters.<br /><br />It performs its intended function very well: I use it to record scientific images of a kind of marine snail known as a cowry. The aperture control allows improved depth of field in the close-up work that I do.<br /><br />This is a well-executed design. I like the 'feel' of its grip-type right side. The optics seem to be everything that they should and the wide angle lens seems to be about the equivalent of a 28mm on a 35mm camera. (The lens-to-extender threading can be difficult to put together, so be careful! Fortunately, the extender itself threads onto the camera body much more readily.)<br /><br />Bearing in mind that I rated the Fuji FinePix 4900 at five stars, let me pick a nit: the lens cap needed further thought! Clearly \"designed\" to be attached at the left side of the camera, it should have had a clip on it to attach it to the neck strap when it was not on the lens. It is very difficult to control this cap unless it is on the right side of the camera, where you can grip it by its lanyard with the hand that you're going to keep on the camera.<br /><br />I have yet to employ all of this camera's features but those that I have used work as they should. Photographers can work with this quality item!","A fine camera, easy to use after minimal reading.Most features are almost intuitive,or can be figured out by the icons on the body.The 4900 does not handle fast moving subjects to well,often missing the shot altogether.You have to pan with a closed shutter on the burst mode(5 shots) and hope you get the good one in the frame.Other than that it is a super camera,doing every thing very well.","I agree with almost all of the good things you have probably already read about this camera, so I won't repeat them.  Still, there are a few areas where Fuji really failed.  The most annoying is that you cannot buy an adapter for mounting filters to the lens.  When you pay this much for a camera with a good lens, you should be able to protect it with an inexpensive clear filter.  As it stands, you have to buy an expensive macro adapter you may not need in order to get the filter ring.  This seems like a customer-unfriendly approach.<br />The autofocus is very slow in all but the most ideal conditions.  You can't capture an expression on someone's face indoors (even in a brightly lit room) unless you go to manual focus.  Also, battery life is too short, especially when the spares they sell are expensive and have a lower capacity than the original equipment.<br />I know this sounds very negative, but in fact the camera is very good in other ways.  I have taken some very nice pictures with it.  Just think carefully about what you want out of any digital camera before you buy.","I'd like it. The quality is very impressive, interface is very good and communication (through USB) with PC is O.K., but could be better. There could be some problems with USB driver installation on Win2000, but true profis could fix it very fast. [On WinNT the software does not work].<br />To compare this thing with classical photo camera, i would say, that the problems are only with fast moving objects on the night. All others things are much, much better.","This camera shoots perfection.  The manual controls are fantastic and the video quality is as good as it gets.  I have been shooting an Olympus and The FD 93 Mavica.  The Fuji 4900 out performs them hands down.  However the major dissapointment was perfect video AND NO SOUND!  O.K. it is a \"still\" camera but with the video capibilitty sound would have been the right move.  If you do not care about sound or voice overs for for commerical work or talking captions buy this camera....I truly wish I would have waited a generation and got the sound feature.  The Fuji FinePix 4900 is a greater than 5 star camera as such but I gave it 4 stars because Fuji dropped the ball in regard to the sound.","This camera is simple enough to use as a point-and-shoot yet has many advanced features. The color and clarity of images is superb. It does well in low-light situations although the built-in flash will usually improve the picture.<br />My only complaints are the irritatingly short battery life (buy a spare battery and the optional battery charger - it shortens charge time to a mere hour!) and the shutter lag. It is almost impossible to snap a good shot of my 3 year-old who can't stand still.<br />Addendum: This is now my camera of choice.  It takes much better pics than either of my 35mm cameras.  Like any digital camera, however, it still doesn't work well with fast-moving subjects because of the shutter lag.","After much work looking for a digital camera, my best choice was the FinePix 4900 and what an excellent camera it is.  I will never use a film camera again!  The pictures and ease of use were just perfect.  I am very happy with my choice.  If you want a great digital, after looking through the FinePix 4900 your choice will become easy.  Now I just have to find the right digital printer :)","The 6X zoom is powerful and the picture quality is superb. I like all the features too. It goes from fully automatic to fully manual for a professional. It allows an external flash. The only drawback which is true of all digital cameras is they take a lot of energy to run. The battery lasts about an hour give or take. But that is the same for all digital cameras.<br />I hope the wide angle attachment is available soon.","It is comfortable and easy to grip. The pictures are outstanding. It adjusted well to poor indoor lighting conditions. The movie format produces great pictures as well. I have friends with 2.1Mpixel cameras and the movies are not as good a quality. The only downfall is that the camera doesn't have any sound features.","It is comfortable and easy to grip.

I need a min. of two 64 meg memory sticks. 128 or 256 or cd rom would be very nice and would be very helpful. I am waiting for next generation before I buy. Please hurry with the upgrades for memory, battery and lens options. Low light photos are a priority also. get off the stump and move fwd. I want to buy, but want what I need.<br />Thanks Dave","Wow. I knew I was getting a powerful camera. What I didn't understand is that I was getting the best, too. I was the last of my closest friends to get a digital camera -- and now I have the envy of the pack. While they're busy replacing batteries -- I'm still shooting, thanks to the \"video camera\" style of battery. Just plug in the camera, with the supplied A/C cable, and shot until nightfall. I haven't run out of juice yet!<br />I used a pretty high resolution my first time out... I could see the pores of my daughters arms, in focus, with perfect clarity. It might have TOO good of resolution. Get this camera, and skip the little point and shoots. This baby turns heads, and does amazing work to boot!","This camera has a very appealing body design.

This is disappointing when using the movie mode.","I have had the camera a month and so far it has lived up to its expectations and stated specifications. Using the big LCD display without the battery-saver enabled, I was only able to operate it on a fully charged battery for maybe 20 mins before the battery needed recharging, so if you were bringing the camera to an outside event and you like the LCD display, you will need to buy another spare battery...","I've had this camera for over a month now and I love it. I tried many digital cameras but decided on this marvel. Its loaded with features, has a quailty build, feels good in the hand and best of all it takes beautiful pictures. It's also one of the fastest on the market at this time (no shutter lag) You just can't go wrong with this purchase. Enjoy!","If you are tired of all those expensive cameras that are just 'duds', your solution is here.  The Fuji FinePix 4900 Digital Camera is truly one of the best cameras I've ever worked with.  All the high-tech features make this a camera you can't resist.  For this relatively low price you can't find a better value.  So if you're a person who loves to have the upmost in quality, BUY THIS CAMERA!"]},{"name":"Olympus D-490 Zoom (C990Z)","amazon_reviews":["This camera takes excellent pictures just as if it were a brand new.

I've used it for year, but someone recently dropped and broke it.<br />The Olympus takes great pictures. They have good color, except in flourescent lighting, which showed up as yellow. For fast moving objects, the flash is required to avoid blurring. For objects with bright light in the background and the foreground in shadow, the flash needs to be forced. In the dark, pictures will turn out with good color as long as nothing is moving while taking the picture. The camera takes longer to take the picture in poor lighting. Scenery pictures come out wonderful. I've even caught the glistening ice, mist rising from streams, and sunlight filtering through the forest.<br />The Olympus is easy to use with point and click, and autofocus. It also has panoramic and other options.","My D490 is still going strong after about 3 yrs. I do note the plastic door is wearing. The lens seems to be slowing as it moves in & out.  The flash is no problem to use manually. I have used more basic 35mm camera and there are some things you need to do yourself- no big deal. There have been no problems as I too have gotten a card reader to facilitate faster downloads. The real problem is the shutter button is wearing out. This happened on a VHS C camcorder I owned too.I guess I am too hard on this part of a camera.  I used to sell cameras for a big box store and Olympus is a good brand. It is a Ford or Chevy and dependable up to a point. As these cameras have evolved, they have sacrificed some good options and quality to go in new directions. In a way they now resemble the GM and Fords of the late 1970's. I don't doubt that Evolution in real life has had the same process and end results (Why is \"Friends\" in it's 20'th yr.)  At any rate, I can't tell you the trips I've taken and gotten out my camera from my shorts to get a wonderful shot that when taped to my cubical makes my day: Sunsets, men shot out of cannons, Pandas at the Zoo, and waterfalls galore.  Enjoy your camera and know they don't make em like they used to.","I have had a love affair with the Olympus D490 now for 2 years.  And up until very recently, I would have sung nothing but praises for this camera. (In spite of the stupidity of having to manually open and close cover to turn camera on/off and/or view pictures)  We got along great, we went everywhere together, I had decided that this camera was the love of my life...UNTIL...tragedy struck.  This damn bastard camera just up and gave out one day.  No warning, no \"dear john letter\" no nothing...just abandonment and betrayal.  And things were going so well for us too!  How was I to know that complete heartbreak was right around the corner?<br />I don't know if I can ever trust or love another camera again.  And if I do, you can bet it's not going to be an Olympus.  For the 400.00+ I spent on this baby 2 years ago (and yeah, i know the prices have come way down)..I would have expected this thing to last longer than it has. In closing...enjoy your D490 while you can...but know in your heart that your joy is fleeting, and that like all good things in life...the joy comes to an end and leaves you miserable and alone (cameraless). Merry Freaking Christmas.","Like others, I have absolutely loved my Olympus D-490 Zoom digital camera -- until now.  I have seen several reviews in this list reporting a sudden and unexpected electrical death of the camera.  I am now mourning just that same event.  Love ya, Olympus, but I fear I cannot now trust ya!","I've been reading everyone elses reviews and I am shocked.  I have had nothing but good experiences with my camera.  Yes, it does eat up the battery if you use the LCD screen but if you use good batteries like the energizer e squareds, it works great.  The software is fairly easy to use (contrary to what most say).  I have to agree with most though when they say the serial port is too slow.  I bought a smartmedia USB reader the same day and haven't had a problem since.  With the price being so low now a days with used cameras on the market, you might as well pick one up.  They work great.  I've never had a problem and I've had mine for over 2 years.  i am a very satisfied customer.","I ordered my camera on...and recieved it...and have used it every day since, ...and I am very pleased with the camera and the sevice from Amazon.com and VipMart. My camera was a refurb and it works very well. I have several SLR's and this camera will always be by my side and the first one I pick up to shoot with.<br />I am by nature the first one to find fault (or so I'm told) with everything but not this time. Have no fear, get one of these if you are in the market for a point and shoot camera that can do much more than just take a snapshot! Steve.","I thought this might be of help to those of you who are nervous about buying on line and especially buying a refurb camera. The Olympus I bought came from Vipmart via the Amazon link. I also puchased a new Olympus 128mb smart card with it. I got a good price on the card but I stole the D-490! The ad said, the camera had slight scratches on it and it was a refurb for $139.00 The scratches were so slight I had a hard time finding them and it works great! I also found that when hooked up through your VCR your can record unlimited movies! I have not found my old mikes with RCA jacks yet but I'm convinced It will record the audio as well. I wonder why they don't advertise this fact? On the con side... They didn't send me the strap! Oh well, I gotta complain about something don't I?","Loved the camera when I first got it, although the picture quality wasn't fabulous it was fine for a first digital camera.  However, the camera stopped working just after my one year warranty ran out requiring it to be shipped back to Olympus for a complete overhaul ...Sadly, I know of at least one other with the same problem with an Olympus camera, so I'm wary of the brand now.","It takes great pictures for a small amount of money.  I'll never buy film again!","I've had this camera for almost a year and it's had very very heavy use. I do a lot of work in the field and this camera \"folds\" down so that it fits easily in my front pocket (cargo pants, not jeans). The slide close over the lens is perfect for protecting the lens, the flash disappears into the body. Unlike the other reviewer(s), I've not had any problems with the software; I moved to rechargeable batteries fairly soon after I bought the camera, however, I never used to LCD screen much as I have to look at my subjects (eye to eye) to photograph them; I'm never \"behind the camera.\" That I could just set the lens to wide angle and shoot from the hip has been a breeze with the mighty-mite. Only quibble is with the noise the lens makes (wide-tele); that is, I prefer an almost silent adjustment...However, for most, I'd think the very solid sound of the barrell changing from tele-wide-tele, would be satisfying, and good feedback.","I HAVE HAD SUCH FUN WITH THIS CAMERA. AFTER TWO YEARS I AM STILL FINDING NEW FEATURES, YET I WAS ABLE TO TAKE GREAT PICTURES IMMEDIATLEY. THE 2.1 MEGAPIXELS ALLOWS FOR EXTENSIVE CROPPING AND ENLARGING EVEN IN HQ MODE.WITH TIFF MODE YOU CAN TAKE VERY DETAILED PHOTOS OF ART OR NATURE SUBJECTS. THE 3X OPTICAL ZOOM DISTINGUISHES THE D-490 IN IT'S PRICE RANGE (OF COURSE NOW I WANT THE 10X C-2100). DIGITAL ZOOM IS IRRELEVANT.  UNLESS THEY HAVE CHANGED THE SERIAL PORT THING YOU WILL NEED A FLASHPATH CARD READER. ALSO SOME OTHER EDITING PROGRAM THAN THAT PROVIDED IN THE BOX; I USE MY SCANNER PROGRAM, BUT PHOTOSHOP LE OR OTHERS WOULD WORK AS WELL. I NEVER KNEW I LOVED PHOTOGRAPHY UNTIL I GOT THIS CAMERA","Great pictures, but following problems were encountered.<br />Very short battery life.<br />Software problems (tech help was very good but still took 1/2 hour to fix).<br />Oddly designed lens door causes lens to jam while camera powers down.<br />In summery, this is what I would call a Microsoft type product, When working, and when the software is not crashing, it will satisfy and take great pictures for its roughly ($) price tag.","I am an avid amateur photographer and bicyclist. After many years using an Olympus OM-1 SLR, I wanted a light camera to put in my backpack and I wanted freedom from processing of film. My only hesitation was the loss of lens interchangability that was a feature of the SLR.<br />Now, after a year of constant use, I am sorry I didn't make the move to this digital camera earlier. It has been riding with me daily and is always ready to pop out and shoot. The case is getting a little scratched but I've taken care to protect the LCD viewing surface, though I find the optical viewfinder is fine for almost all my photos, with the exception of close up shots (macros).<br />I've dropped the camera a foot onto a carpeted floor with no ill effects. Very occasionally it will refuse to operate but I've found the difficulty is with either weak batteries or poor battery contact, both of which are easily remedied. The lithium cells supplied seem to work forever but are not rechargeable. Alkaline batteries will not work in chilly (less than 50 degree) temperatures. The best batteries I've found for price vs. performance are nickel metal hydride rechargeables. The camera uses lots of current, so if you take many shots in a short time, especially if the flash and LCD screen are used, the batteries will become warm.<br />As a long time 35mm film user I was concerned about color quality and sharpness. No need to worry. Picture quality is outstanding and excellent 8x10 prints are easily obtained with the standard \"HQ\" setting that has some compression and allows 16 shots with a 8MB memory card. This setting also produces excellent photos for PC wallpaper when reduced from the 1600x1200 native size to 1024x768 for PC's. The Camedia software that comes with the camera is adequate but if you do lots of photo work I'd recommend a graphics program for ease of picture manipulation and titling. Light sensitivity is amazing and nighttime shots without flash (tripod required) produce excellent results when the sensitivity is set to ISO 400. The flip up flash is great because you can be sure the flash will not go off simply by leaving it folded down. Sunrise/sunset shots come out very well on full automatic. The ability to use \"spot\" light metering will turn a dark subject against a light background into a very nice picture and fill flash is always available to help. Auto white balance makes adjusting for inside or outside light a memory. For almost all situations this camera really is point and shoot and I've caught many scenes that would have left me fumbling with my old manual SLR and lenses. I couldn't be more pleased with the D490. It's one of the best purchases I've ever made.","I use this camera to no end; as far as ease of use or general quality is concerned, i've never used anything better. I will admit that i'm a stickler for macro, so it's wide-angle exclusivity is a bit of a drag, and it doesn't handle motion or low-light situations... at all (major blurriness issues). so really this camera's usefulness is determined by what you plan to do with it. it's small, lightweight, and the design is infinitely user-friendly, so in as far as snapshot photography is concerned, it's more or less ideal. for the hardcore digital photo junkie, it's simply not going to be adequate, but this camera really was not designed with that kind of use in mind. i just set mine to standard quality and shoot my 150 pictures to the 16mb card, and am pleased.<br />as far as image quality, i find it's color fidelity is very nice, and even when not fully in focus, the images are always... pretty. so yes, all-around good-time camera, but really not so geek-oriented as what i might use for other purposes.","After reading reviews of this camera and many others I decided that this was the one would be my first digital camera. After one year of owning this camera, I would have to say that overall, I not really to disappointed with it. It definitly has some flaws, such as with the door, which sometimes doesn't want to close right, and batteries are used up quicker than what I read they would.It does not take very good pictures of motion shots at all. They are usually blurry or seem out of focus. It does not take as good pics outdoors as it does indoors but still acceptable. Indoors with the flash, I have found that it takes excellent pictures, which most people take with these type cameras anyway. Also, if you really want to take advantage of this camera, get one of the 32 or 64 MB cards and a flash memory reader for your computer. The software that comes with it isn't that good either so if you don't already have a decent editing program you might want to get one like Adobe Photo Deluxe or something similar.I still have not found out what the limit of this camera is and hopefully by next year can give a better review.","I, too, was thrilled with my purchase when I got it, and I studied carefully many Amazon reviews before doing so last year.  I then bought three for family members and friends last Christmas.  Since that time, my camera and two others (perhaps even the other one, I have not asked) have broken down and needed repair - quite embarassing to have to face my gift recipients.  They ALL simply froze up, and one is still at the factory after two months.<br />The durability of this camera is greatly suspect, and the customer service and responsiveness of the Olympus factory is deplorable.  My suggestion to you is to keep looking - I wish I had.","This camera is a great point and shoot camera. It's great for closeups, colors come out great. Sometimes the pictures come out a little dark but that can be overcome by use of the flash.  I've seen the results of other cameras in the same price range and I don't think they come close. I wish it had a 10x zoom but that would make it bulkier. It comes with 8MB smartmedia card, I bought a 64MB smartmedia for 50 bucks which gives me about 120 high res. jpeg pictures.<br />CONS: It doesn't come with an AC adapter, rechargeable batteries and USB interface.<br />I don't like is having to remember to manually pop up the flash. Another thing is that I get some of red eyes even though it has red eye reduction.","My wife uses the Olympus D-490 in her real estate business taking home interior and exterior pictures for brochures and presentations, and I use the D-490 for aerial photos from a hot air balloon. It's easy to review, edit and download the pictures, but I would buy an extra 32 or 64 bit memory card. Of course we also use it for everday family photos and it compares with any camera we have ever owned. I'm buying another to replace one that got stolen.","As this was my first foray into digital photography, I was expecting a difficult to learning experience. But no, I am getting spectaular results and was able to figure out most things just by the menus on the camera.-- not entirly satified with the digital zoom yet. But still I have some outstanding photos for my early results.","Great digital camera for the price.  Easy to use and photos are exceptional.  Fun, fast and user friendly!","The Olympus D-490 offers a great camera to take wonderful digital photos.  If the intended purpose is digital display of the photos this is a wonderful camera.  The down side is you will have to provide your own rechargable batteries and get an external USB digital media reader.  These two additional items will help your enjoyment and use of the camera.","I bought the D-490 in December 2000 and am very impressed with the camera so far. I'm always amazed at the clearity and sharpness of the photos I take. When I print them out, they look like regular 35mm photos, as long as I don't blow them up too big. This is my first digital camera, and I love being able to email photos so easily to friends and family. They have told me how remarkably clear the photos I send them are. In fact, one friend was so impressed, he bought a D-490 too. Batteries last a long time in this camera which is nice, some cameras can really eat up the batteries, but this one suprises me. I must take like a hundred photos in between battery changes. The only down side to this camera is that sometimes the photos are a little dark, but this is easily remedied with some photo enhancing software. I may be able to change the exposure setting on the camera to lighten it up a bit, but haven't played with that yet. The downloading hardware that comes with the camera is way to slow, so just go buy a USB reader and you'll be set.","I purchased this camera two months ago and have taken approximately 400 pictures to date with it. The first digital camera I had was a Polaroid PDC 640. The reason I first looked at the Olympus D-490Z is it also used the same Smartmedia cards. Smartmedia cards are credit card thin, they are cheaper than compactflash, and I was already familiar with them. The main reason why I wanted a new digital camera was zoom capabilities which my former camera did not have.<br /><br /> The highlights of this camera are: 2.1 Megapixel, autofocus 3X optical zoom, 2.5X digital zoom, 6 mode flash, Quicktime movie mode, it's compact size, color LCD TFT display, and Smartmedia compatibility. The lowest picture quality is 640 by 480 and the highest is 1024 by 768. There is also a panoramic picture mode. This feature assists you in stitching images together. But, if you want to utilize this mode you have to use Olympus brand Smartmedia cards.<br /><br /> This is a menu driven camera with two discre!et menus. All camera options such as exposure, simulated film speed, resolution, and flash modes can be operated through these menus. These options also give this digital camera the feel of a filbm camera.<br /><br /> The flash that is mounted on the body of the camera is slightly confusing to use. This is because you have to manually pop-up the flash before the camera can choose to use it when taking the picture. If you do not manually pop-up the flash, the camera cannot use it when photographing.<br /><br /> What I found particularly unusual about this camera was that when using the zoom feature the lens moves inside of a housing. This means that you can mount an additional lens onto the outside of it. I have purchased an additional lens which allows me to do extreme close ups. The camera has a feature to do \"macro\" shots, but this lens allows me to get even closer and take pictures of matchbox cars, insects, and flowers.<br /><br /> I was considering other cameras in the Olympus D-400 !series, however this was the only one with the ability to do Quicktime movies lasting up to 15 seconds in high quality mode. I didn't think I would use this feature because there is another mode that the camera has called sequential shooting. But, for some moving objects that I tried to capture with my camera, I was unsuccessful using sequential shooting. The length between captures is too large for fast moving objects. Using this \"movie\" mode makes it easier and quicker. The only negative about movie mode is that the flash does not work in this mode. This camera gives you the greatest ability to change parameters, but continues to be a fully automatic point and shoot camera.<br /><br /> Since I have purchased this camera, Olympus has come out with a D-500 series camera, which has a higher digital zoom, but the camera itself appeared to be made of cheaper materials. I strongly suggest reviewing the manual that comes with this camera as you really can't operate the camera sucessful!ly without reading it. As for a suggestion for the other reviewers, I would recommend using some sort of adapter for transferring pictures to your computer. I use a 3 1/2\" disc adapter that lets me avoid using the supplied software.","I was able to purchase this camera ... after rebates. A true bargain indeed for all the wonderful features and quality. Simply stated.... this piece of equipment is SUPER!!!!!!!!","I bought my Olympus D490Zoom a few moths ago to replace my broken D220L (a point and shoot olympus digital camera) and it blew me away! Finally I was able to zoom in on things with optical zoom and get a bit closer with the digital zoom. Picture quality is excellent. The fact that it has a serial port adapter rather than the USB is a big plus, since not all of us have USB. My only complaint is the camedia software that came with it. maybe it acts a bit different on the PC, but on the mac its a bit slow and not as good as the software that came with my previous camera. Also it didn't come with rechargable batteries and a recharger like my other one did (which wasn't a big issue) and it came with one 8MB card with no sort of case. The camera itself is one of the best cameras, film or digital that I have put my hands on.","I bought this camera (Olympus D-490z) a few months ago and love it.  After taking pictures with a normal camera (Canon SLR AE-1), I wanted a digital camera to releive the frustration of photo labs losing my film.  Also, it's easy to take a picture, review it, delete it, and retake.  With normal cameras(film), you take a picture and hope you got the right shot after it's developed.  There's also a feature to take sequenced shots to display action which I use all the time.<br />This camera has a problem with taking quick pictures.  I'm trying to use it to take action pictures of soccer and fencing.  Once you push the button to take the picture, it takes a second to capture the image.  Just be warned that it's hard to take action shots with this camera and all digial cameras.<br />Also, after a few months of camera use, this camera stopped turning on.  I search Amazon's site for a phone number to call, but only found email addresses.  Finally, I sent an email explaining my broken camera and they sent me a number to call.  After talking to their customer support, they sent me a new camera to replace my broken one without a hassle.<br />Satisfied Customer, Tom","I guess the title says it all. After going through lots of reviews, spending endless nights at the comparometer at the.. website.. poring over the differences in the camera images I finally got fed up. Since my Olympus film camera has been serving me wonderfully well, I on a hunch decided to go for the D 490 Zoom though the Kodak Dc 4800 was on my list right till the moment I clicked the submit button.<br />And I am really glad that I bought this camera. Extremely intuitive interface, very very easy to setup, handles like a film camera and excellent 2.11 megapixel images at an extremely affordable price. This camera is ideal for almost everyone except perhaps professionals wanting to shoot NASCAR races.  The indoor photographs are very detailed, with brilliant colors. Flash works extremely well. Outdooe photographs are equally brilliant. You can change the settings to make the camera behave like ISO 100 , 200 or 400.<br />My roomie has a Kodak Dc 280 and we have been using that camera for about six months now. And D490 beats..[around]..that camera. You have to give this to Olympus that these people do not spend a lot of money on advertising etc. but when it comes to optics they know there stuff and do not cut corners.<br />I clicked a lot of photographs in high quality mode (1600 * 1200 around 350 K for a jpeg image) and low quality (640 * 480 around 60 K for a jpeg image) and image quality was very good in both the cases.<br />You might want to go for D460 if you are a bit tight on budget but if you are willing to shell out [the] bucks or so then D 490 is the way to go really.<br />Pros: 1. Brilliant Pictures (that is what is paramount in any camera) 2. Very intuitive interface. 3. Light weight and quite portable. 4. Brilliant Flash 5. Motion picture capability for 2 minutes<br />Cons: 1. Serial transfer to computer. Slow. Though Olympus was offering free USB reader by mail until recently and for which I qualified. 2. Camedia software no great shakes. 3. No battery charger or AC Adapeter supplied with the camera. 4. Only 8 MB memory card.","This is an incredible camera with a very nice price.  I have a huge 3.4 megapixel that takes super pictures but is very heavy.  My Olympus D490 takes extrmemely nice pictures and it's a small, lightweight size. You can take it anywhere.  It also has all the features you would expect in a much more expensive camera.  The pictures come out crisp and bright, and the macromode is super easy.  For the price you get so much more than you would expect.  Olympus did it again with this keeper!","This is a really good camera (I have the C990Z - it's the same as the D490Z except that it uses PAL video out instead of NTSC.) Before you buy it, (or more likely if you've just bought it), you need to know a couple of things. 1. The hole for the tripod is offset to the extreme left of the camera, so the little \"traveller's tripods\" aren't safe to use with this camera unless you're very careful. 2. Only buy Olympus brand smart-media, otherwise you can't access the panorama function (if this is important to you.) 3. Never format the Smart-media card - just do a \"delete-all\". 4. It appears that all of the Smart-media floppy adapters that you can buy come from one company - Smartdisk.  They have driver software ([...]) that works with Windows 2000 that doesn't come in the box. (If you choose to buy a floppy adapter.) 5. I use 1500 mAhr NiMH batteries from Kodak - they're great.  The kodak battery charger is also awesome - it comes with 4 different plug types, and works with AC power from 100 to 240 Volts, and either 50 or 60 Hz.  Pretty much covers the civilised world. (and the USA too ;-)) 6. Accessing uncompressed mode is not mentioned anywhere in the manual.  You do it by selecting the mode one down (eg SHQ to go to SHQ-TIFF), and then press the up arrow and HOLD IT DOWN for more than a few seconds. Leaving this out of the manual was a blunder. 7.  The Camedia Master software is pretty ordinary, with one exception --- the digital panorama function works better than you can ever imagine, even without a tripod.  With a tripod it's perfect. 8.  I have managed to confuse my camera once - popping the batteries out and then putting them back in was enough to get around that. 9.  If the camera is zoomed when you close the lens cover, it makes more of that annoying grinding noise than usual, but it doesn't seem to be a real problem. 10. The camera's focus system works by looking for vertical lines - if you don't have any, to get really perfect focus you need to hold the camera sideways (presuming that there are horizontal lines in your picture), half press the button to hold the focus, and then rotate the camera back to normal.  In practice, the pictures usually come out very good without going to any extra trouble. 11. This camera is not the smallest, but it is a comfortable size.  My previous camera was a tiny APS camera, and I had trouble holding that one steady while pressing the shutter button. Ideally, you should hold a camera in your hands before you buy it.  Then buy it at the best price.<br />The conclusion is that I like my camera.  It is good enough to justify the price, even when you include the extra money that I paid for the extra memory card, batteries, battery charger, and floppy disk adapter (adds up to about 50% more.)  I wish that I knew the things that I have just told you before I bought my camera though.","I recently purchase this camera at 300 dollars and it's a really great camera and it's easy to use.  The picture quality is great and the zoom is great. This is my first digital camera and I think it's a great buy especially with the USB reader because the other cable the came with the camera is to slow.  It's also great that you can zoom in your photos after you've taken them.  I was going to by the elph canon 2.1 megapixel camera which cost around the same price but this was much cheaper and a great product.","This is a great camera.  I bought it primarily for travel, but I've been having fun with it around the house too!  The picture quality is amazing!  Very impressive!  I highly suggest making use of the USB reader--it acts like just another floppy drive--no download required!  Just slip in the memory card and the pictures are ready to be emailed, editted or printed!  I can't wait to see what this camera will do for me when I'm on my trip!","I purchased the D490Z two months ago based on many reviews I had read by those who already purchased the camera. My main reason for purchasing the camera was because of the reviews on the quality of picture for a 2.1 megapixel camera (and comparisons to higher MP cameras for that matter) and I must say I am impressed.  Since many people had listed pro's and cons in their reviews, I was prepared when I received the camera.<br />I find I carry the camera with me whenever I can and in two months I'm still using the original set of batteries after taking more than 150 pictures.  Whenever possible I use the AC adapter and it was well worth the money spent.  Since downloads take a while and I haven't received the free USB reader, I use it frequently.  I also download all my pictures on to a VHS tape before putting them on the computer.  Great option for sending copies of pictures to family members who don't have a computer and saves on printing costs.  I have a HP 932 printer and am extremely happy with the prints.<br />I have used the camera in many situations including flourescent light and in bars.  I am totally impressed with the pictures in both situations using different camera settings to adjust the light balance to get the best picture.  It's also handy to have the ability to work with ISO and brightness features to get good pictures when you can't or don't want to use flash.  Unless you really need to change it, the HQmode (1600x1200) is perfect for printouts.  You can always change to 640x480 with the software for e-mails, although I tend to use Adobe photoshop or Microsoft PictureIt rather than the Camedia software that came with the camera.<br />With all electronic items, you need to take the time to learn how to use them to avoid frustrations.  I sat down with the manual and read through every option while trying it on the camera.  This camera has so many great options and for the price of (PRICE)I am more than pleased.  I purchased the camera, 32 MB card (which I have yet to use as I tend to download pictures as soon as I can), case, adapter and warranty for (PRICE)and think it was well worth the money.  The 8 MB card that came with the camera takes 19 pictures in HQ mode and think along with that and the 32MB card, I should be ready for most situations.<br />Overall, the camera is an excellent product taking into the consideration what other reviewers have listed as cons (many of which I don't consider cons - if all electronics were perfect for everyone, there wouldn't be competition).  My recommendations are to learn about what you have, be patient and I think you'll be very pleased with the results.  After all, the pictures are what counts the most and I recommended the camera Olympus D490Z to others without hesitation.  The results speak for themselves.","Really like this camera, takes great shots and has lots of features. The video looks great too for a still camera. Uploads to your computer are cruddy slow, hopefully the USB should speed it up whenever I get it, it's been 6 weeks. Definently get the NIMH batteries and charger although Alk. AA's work good in a pinch. Also the 32MB card is a good buy it will give you around 170 shots in .jpg mode but of course it will take you over 4 weeks to download them all. ha  I also bought the Tamrac 5694 Digital 4 - Digital/Photo Bag here on Amazon. Definently a good camera though.","How many photos can be taken at highest quality and lowest quality?","The PROS: - Very user-friendly.  The menus are easy to navigate, etc.  Any problems I did run into (which weren't so much problems as my being inexperienced) just took a quick glance at the User's manual to figure out. - SmartMedia.  The SmartMedia cards are a great way to save your pictures.  Since the store I bought them at didn't have a 64 MB card available, I opted for two 32s (they gave me a discount), in addition to the 8 MB that came with the camera.  Enough memory for any family vacation/occasion. - Zoom.  The zoom is a great way to get closer up (obviously)...you can zoom further on your computer, zooming too much, of course, reduces image quality (on the computer). - Lightweight.  The camera is light but certainly not flimsy.  Easy to carry around to sporting events, etc. - Sturdy.  I've seen a few reviews which said the camera seemed to be easily breakable.  I haven't seen that at all & have used it every day for a few weeks.  True, the cover is strange at first but it took all of 1 minute to figure it out. - Free USB reader.  This is essential since it has no USB output.  However, a free one from Olympus takes care of that problem (of course, I just ordered it today so let's see how long it takes to arrive).<br />The CONS: - \"5 Recordable modes\" - While it is true that the camera has 5 recordable modes: SQ, SQ-High, HQ, SHQ, and SHQ-TIFF, it took me 4 calls to figure out how to select SQ-HIGH and SHQ-TIFF (you'll see what I mean unless I'm really not as bright as I think I am!).  Hint:  Keep the arrow button depressed (hold it down) at \"SQ\" or \"SHQ\" & it will highlight the option to the right!  Nothing about this in the User's Manual.<br />Overall: A-","I've been waiting to buy a digital camera for about 2 years but I never considered the resolution good enough to leave my standardd film camera aside. With the 2.1 megapixel generation, I started to consider that idea. The first item that I started looking for was a company that already in the photo business (like Kodak, Olympus, Nikon and etc). After that, I wanted a camera that had the look of a standard camera and was as easy to use as a film camera. I'm not a professional user, then I needed a point-and-shoot camera. After a loooooooooooong research, I got this EXCELENT product. The quality is amazing! As good as a normal camera. Besides the features of recording short quicktime movies and panoramic photos (and it's fairly easy! I got it right at once!). If you can complain about this camera you can complain about two things: the Flash is not really automatic. You need to open it, it does not pop by itself. After open, then the camera uses if it's needed or not. Another point is the conection; it's a paralel connection and not USB. With the free Smarmedia reader that Olympus is offering, this problem is solved.<br />If you're planning on buying a point-and-shoot camera that anybody can use without any trouble and that takes picture with GREAT quality, consider this camera.","I recently purchased the 490Z because of the zoom capability not available in the earlier versions of digital photography.I previously had a Olympus320. What a surprise when I started to look at the features and functions. They were so similar that I hardly had to look at the book. More importantly, all the accessories that came with the 490 were the same as my old ones i/e the cable for the TV, the cable to my computer. I commented to my spouse that I never had a product line, phones, auto dialers,etc., that had such vertical likeness. It was pure pleasure in the migration to the new product. Today simple is good and Olympus hit a bullseye with the continued product upgrades.","The camera works well, but I applied for the USB card reader in December & have yet to receive it (It's almost April now!). If you own a Macintosh, you need this device. Without it, you cannot download the pictures. I'd suggest you look elsewhere if you are needing a card reader. (I have called the rebate line numerous times... they just say \"it should be coming soon\").","I chose the Olympus 490Z with help from the reviews right here, and from a gut feeling that this would be a super camera.  It is.<br />I've owned this camera for about 2 weeks now, and would not put myself in the expert category yet, but it is so darned simple I will be there soon!  If you're worried about ease of use, don't.  I took a picture 5 minutes out of the box (after I figured out how the batteries went!)  My 10 year-old watched as I showed him how to look at the pictures on the monitor and took a couple of him.  Left it alone with him for a couple of hours and came back to find a cardfull of very interesting, excellent pictures. I cannot believe the picture quality, it is awesome!<br />I have a new DELL laptop computer that I used to download (serial, waiting for my USB reader) my photos with, which has Windows 2000 ME, and have had no problems in that regard.  Takes about 15 minutes for 18-20 photos to download.  Still using the original batteries that came in the camera, but bought backups because nothing lasts forever.<br />I almost gave this 4 stars, but decided that wasn't fair.  I bought the camera for the picture quality and point-and-shoot ability, not the photo software (Camedia), which is lame.  Some of the editing tools work well, other's don't seem to at all, and some I just can't figure out.  Along with that, I'm not able to access any user's guide to the software - other than the help menu, which is not much help.  The user's manual comes out on my computer as gibberish and is unreadable.  I even tried loading on another computer, which was just upgraded with Adobe, and still can't read it.  There is a magic wand editing tool that I simply cannot figure out, and can't find any help for.  Will have to call tech support, I guess.<br />To overcome these problems, I bought an HP 932c printer (around $150), and use the Microsoft Photo Editor (already on my computer) to create fantastic printed photos - look like they came from the developer.  I made some gorgeous greeting cards by taking a picture of some flowers, then using the stained-glass effect in MS Photo Editor and printing them out.  Too cool!  I'm having a blast!<br />Accessories I bought were a 16MB card (wanted 32, but not available where I was shopping), Nihm rechargable batteries and charger.  Looking hard at the AC adapter, my free USB reader should be coming soon.<br />Final words:  I love this camera.  I'm a klutz, and I can use this camera to take great pictures.  The lens cover IS tricky, but thanks to this site I was aware it may be a problem, so have trained myself to be careful.","Pros: Easy to use.  You can whip it out, pop it open, and shoot, all with one hand.  Compact.  Nice user manual.  Nice pictures!  I have been pleased with the quality.  Works great with the NiMh rechargeable batteries, which I would highly recommend.  Uses smart media, which is convenient, and pretty cool.  Some other nifty features: red eye reduction flash, rapid fire sequence shooting, makes small videos at 15 frames per second, video output jack, comes with decent software.<br />Cons: Only two resolutions to choose from: 1600x1200 and 640x480.  An intermediate resolution would have been nice (of course, you can resize the images on your computer).  User interface is okay but could be better (sometimes confusing - you get different menus when the camera is open vs. when it is closed, and the menus aren't that intuitive).  I needed an hour with the manual, and I'm not all that stupid.  No USB connection, and the serial cable is really REALLY slow (but there are alternatives, like the USB reader and the Flash Path adapter).<br />Conclusion: This is an excellent mid-level digicam.  Not a good choice for a serious photographer, but great for someone like me who likes to snap pictures of friends and places.  I would have given it 3.5 stars instead of 3 if I could have.","I am having a lot of fun with this camera.  Takes great pictures, and I actually think the software supplied is pretty good for sorting and downloading the photos onto the computer--for actually tinkering with the photos, I use both Adope Photo Deluxe and Corel Photo-Paint. Couple of bugs with my unit explain the four stars:1) I cannot select all five resolutions--two intermediate settings are displayed, but the camera won't select them.  2)  The battery life indicator doesn't seem to work--it's displayed, but the Lithium batteries died without warning (after lots of use). The Movie feature is a fun gimmick.  So is the ability to plug directly into a T.V. to view the photos as a slide show. The camera is small, which makes it easy to take along.  Fits in a jacket pocket.  I like the lens cover, and the unit seems sturdy. I am looking forward to getting the USB reader in the mail.  Downloads with the serial port take too long. I bought this as my first digital camera.  I wanted the zoom, and I wanted a convenient size and 2 megapixels.  There were a few models that met these criteria, and the zoom on this Olympus (as well as the video feature) sold me on this one.  I am hoping that the two minor bugs described above are easily resolved.","Wouldn't change a thing about this camera...  Have taken approximately 150 shots in the last week--color saturation is beyond compare.  Takes better shots in low light conditions than my 35mm (try some candlelit photos).  I also bought the add-on 64 meg memory card, which holds 45 SHQ (uncompressed 1600x1200 JPEG), or 255 640x480 lower-res shots.  I never use the lower resolutions, after seeing how great the 1600x1200 SHQ looks as an 11x14 poster.  I am still using the lithium batteries that came with the camera; still showing full charge even after 150 shots and lots of \"show and tell\" through the LCD for my friends.  I do use the add-on AC adapter to power the downloads, though.  About that downloading:  Using the serial port, takes about an hour to download the entire 64 meg card.  I call it my \"One-Hour FOTO\", and count it well worth the wait.  While you're purchasing add-ons, remember to buy a nice, new portfolio -- you're gonna need it...","In most of the reviews I have seen, the biggest concern has been battery life. I have to tell you that batteries are not a problem so long as you get good ones with high capacity. I have the Olympus Battery package which I got from Amazon . . .. The package comes with 4 AA 1600mAhr batteries. I charged them on 6 February, did a trip to Belize, took about 150 pictures which I was showing to all the people in our group every night.We only had power on our island for 2 hours in the morning and two hours in the evening, so I could not chagre them again, and so I brought some regular AA's for backup. It is now 25 Feb, and I have just finished editing the shots down to about 100 that I want to keep, and I am still working on the initial battery charge. The backup AA's I brought are still in the sealed package.","I've only had the camera for about a week but so far I love it. Ihave used the Nikon coolpix 950 and the Olympus d360l at work but this one has been the easiest to use.  I decided to get the 490 over the 460 because of the higher quality pictures. But if quantity is your game you can lower the quality to be more like the 460. I spent about 30 minutes reading the manual and was able to figure out how to use all the features on the camera. It is very user friendly.  In fact the first time I hooked it up to my computer it corrected the clock to my computer's clock. I don't understand why Olympus did not use the USB, but apparently they are compensating this by giving a free usb reader rebate.  I don't mind having to open the flash because the camera lets you know when it's not open.  The lens slide is a little cumbersome but it does protect the lens very well.  So far I haven't had a problem with with this camera.  If you look around you can find the Olympus 64mb smartmedia for $ (I found several places).  That's only $ more than other memory cards and you get the panoramic shots.","This is my first experience with a digital camera and I am very impressed.  Part of my decision to purchase this camera was the reasonable cost, but it didn't really turn out that way.  By the time I bought the extra card, the adapter, the case, the recharage batteries, it ended up costing $200 more.<br />Unfortunately, it will now cost me another $50 or so because the Camedia software that comes with the camera is, in my opinion, only good for viewing the pictures on your computer.  It's ability to print multiple shots and resize your pictures for printing is very poor.  The red eye reduction feature doesn't even work.  I called tech support and was told it only works if the color is a true fire engine red in the eye.  Well, I guess the eyes I photograph have a slight hint of orange in them, so it doesn't work.  Oh, well!  I'm looking at the Corel Photo-Paint 9 Digital Camera edition software or the Microsoft PictureIt.  I'll probably go with Corel, based on the great reviews.<br />Isn't this site great?  Without it I wouldn't have known what to buy.<br />As far as the camera goes, the features are easy to use once you learn them.  Shutting the camera was a little scary at first (as other posts have mentioned), but if it's done carefully, no problem.  I thought I was going to break the battery cover trying to put in back on once the batteries were inserted, so that's a little hard to get used to.  But the pictures are great and the monitor readout is a nice size.  Overall, I recommend this camera.","I was drawn to Olympus when I used a friend's C-2020 which they no longer make.  The D-490 has the same optics, same guts as the 2020 so, naturally, I got the 490.  I looked at Nikon's Coolpix 800, the Canon Elfs and even the higher end Olympus models, including the C-3000 and C-3030 which are 3.1 megapixel cameras. (The friend mentioned above is also a professional photog...he says that if you are not going to make prints bigger than 8 X 10, don't bother paying the extra dough for a 3.1 megapixel.  2.1's do just fine).<br />For the money, I don't see you finding a better digital camera.  I'm not saying it's perfect.  You will read other reviews that find problems with the clamshell cover hitting the lens and the slow serial download and I have the same problems with the camera as they do.  But, when it comes to image quality, versatility, ease of use and price, the D-490 wins, hands down.<br />If you buy any other 2.1 megapixel camera and spend more than this camera is currently selling for you just threw away your money.","This is a really nice camera, as you've seen from the other reviews.  Get a USB port, the serial port is a pain.  You need steady hands or a tripod.  THe most important thing is to be careful with power off.  In another review somoene mentioned that it willwear out the gears in the game, when brining the lens in.  The trick is to hit the lens with cover, then bring it back out just so it's not touching it anymore.  Gotta be quick.  You'll get used to it, and the camera will last much longer.","I was looking for a digital camera to take pictures of my baby to send through e-mail.  I was looking for something easy, and this is it! I've taken 40+ pictures and the original batteries are still in there (I've got the rechargeable ones ready to go!).  I bought this when Olympus was offering the free USB reader, but what comes with the camera is adequate.  The only drawback that I have is that the flash is not automatic, I have to keep remembering to flip the flash up.  The software is easy to use to file all of the pictures. The menu is easy to delete/zoom pictures on the spot.  Worth the money, easy to use!","I am truly enjoying my first digital camera, the Olympus D490-Zoom. What a great little camera! I was able to take photos right out of the box without spending a lot of time reading the manual. The pictures are fantastic! I haven't experienced the massive battery drain reported in other reviews but maybe I haven't used it long enough. I use the HQ setting the most and they turn out fabulous, even printing in 8x10.<br />The downside(s): It takes FOREVER to download the photos to the computer using the serial interface. I am anxiously waiting for my USB reader. Also, the sliding lens cover is a little tricky-if you close it too far it can hang up the lens when it's trying to retract, which can't be good for the motor. Also, the lens cover is a little \"sticky\" to slide, not as smooth as you'd want. The lift-up flash (not automatic) is a little inconvenient, but I'm used to it now and it's not a real problem. I mostly take pictures of my pets, so red-eye (actually, green-eye) is always present with the flash and has to be edited out. There is a red-eye reduction feature, but the dogs won't cooperate! It works well with people, however.<br />On my printer, DeskJet 720C, I have to use the highest quality print feature so the photos don't come out fuzzy. But at the right setting they are perfect.<br />Just be sure to get the USB reader. I was 35 years old when I bought this camera just before Christmas 2000 and have since turned 50 waiting for the pictures to download.<br />All the downsides aside, I definitely recommend this camera.","The D-490Z takes very good pictures. I couldn't believe that this small camera can take excellent pictures. The resolution is unbelievable. You can even take panoramic pictures using Olympus Smartmedia. Just for the heck of it, I took 180-degree pictures and they came out perfectly. Now, I can take a shot of St. Patrick's Cathedral from the base up with no problem. I invested to a 64MB Olympus Smartmedia after I've seen what this camera can do. Plus a PCMCIA Smartmedia reader so I don't have to fumble with wires. I also got an external rechargeable battery for long time shooting. I feel like a pro with this camera. Love it!","This is my first digital camera and I am very very happy with it.  Having the 3X optical zoom was a major factor in buying it, as most of the 2 MP competitors have lower optical zoom and rely more on the digital zoom.  (The digital zoom works well too but my understanding is that you don't gain any resolution on your subject, only size.)  Comparing to the other similar cameras, in retrospect it looks like Fuji and HP offer cameras with similar features at lower cost; but I cannot tell you whether they provide worse pictures or not.  This one (490Z) has many good flash, exposure and focus modes as well as an easy point and shoot default.  The QuickTime movie capability attracted me but in reality I have no use for it.  I suppose it would be good if you have a web site and want to put 10-second QuickTime movies of your cat up on it or something.  The camera is also a little bigger than I would prefer- it doesn't fit into my shirt pocket for example- I believe Fuji's comparable is smaller.  Again, I cannot vouch for Fuji's or HP's quality- Olympus might be worth the extra cost, I don't know.  Also, be aware that this camera does not include an AC adapter or a recharger or a USB reader....though they have a free USB reader offer by mail at the moment (January 2001).","I've had this camera for almost three weeks, and I love it.  The pictures it takes are fantastic.  At high-res my 8x10s come out beautiful.  Even at low-res ( with low compression ) the photos are great.<br />The best shots are outdoors.  Landscapes come out great.  It needs decent light indoors, but it has a strong flash.<br />There are a lot of settings to help you get a good shot, and you can review your picture before you move on, so you can take another one if you need to.  The macro lense is great.  Although you can't set the apature or shutter priority, you can trick the camera into giving you \"advanced\" photos.<br />Understand that if you buy this camera, you're going to spend another $100 on accessories.  A battery charger ( NiMH ) and a few sets is a must.  And so is more memory, unless you won't ever use the camera away from a computer.","I received the Olympus D-490 Zoom camera three days ago. Out of the box I was taking still and movie pictures within about ten minutes. Not only is the camera extremely easy to use, but the manual does a great job of explaining the features and functions with minimal confusion. The only exception here is that I didn't find information in the manual on how to switch to the SQ-HIGH and SHQ-TIFF modes. I later found out that to switch to the latter, the user must hold the \"up\" arrow for two seconds. I still haven't figured out how to access the SQ-HIGH.<br />Quality wise, the D-490 Zoom takes crystal clear and colorful images, capturing details that my Olympus film camera couldn't possibly match. The zoom features allow the user to take close-up shots of subjects quite a distance away, while the macro feature allows true close-ups from as little as four or five inches away.<br />My comments about specific features are:<br />1. The built-in multi-mode flash does an excellent job of balancing degrees of light on and around the photo subject. 2. The red-eye and slow-synch features, combined with the 12-second timer resulted in a warm close-up self-portrait that makes it hard to believe no one was holding the camera! 3. The LCD screen is clear and true to actual color, giving the viewer a good idea of what the actual image will look like. 4. The clarity of the images that I downloaded were extremely clean, even at the mid-setting (HQ and SHQ).<br />The only real downside I found to the Olympus D-490 Zoom is that downloading images to the computer using the serial cable is VERY slow. I had read and heard this, but until I downloaded the images myself, I hadn't realized just how slow. Still, once the download was complete, the resulting images made up for the wait.<br />The Olympus D-490 Zoom is overall a wonderful camera, far exceeding my expectations, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality digital camera. I would suggest, however, purchasing at least a 32MB memory card, as well as the USB card reader. With the 32MB card, you shouldn't have to worry about running out of image space, and the USB card reader will allow you transfer/download images at about 1MB per second.","We bought this camera just before Christmas, and it has been GREAT!  It is easy to use and takes wonderful pictures.  The indoors pictures are as good as the outdoors.  If anything, I am over-flashing some of the indoor shots because my previous digital camera had such a poor flash.  It is really cool to be able to review the photos as soon as you take them.  We are very pleased with this product.  The quality is excellent and the price is reasonable.","After much research & returning a Canon model (too confusing to use) I decided on this one based on a review in PC magazine! This is a great camera, easy to use & download pictures. Flipping thru modes is a breeze, not complicated at all. I enjoy action photography and this freezes people in motion. This camera literally froze snow flakes in the air! I have a  Canon 35MM that takes 5 frames per second and it has never caught snow flakes in mid air! The D-490 is great on batteries, even tho I use the display all the time. Very efficient. I've used this camera quite a bit in the past month and have yet to replace the two batteries (Olympus Camedia CR-V3). Even tho is is not USB, I had no trouble downloading the pictures to my computer with the D-SUB 9 pin connector. I'd read that it can take forever if you don't have the USB interface, but with a pentium II, 500mhz, 32ram... I had no problem getting my pictures loaded in about a minute or two. I'm still getting the USB card reader, since is supposed to load faster! The print quality with the software that came with the camera is incredible. This camera will never compete with  $1,000. 35MM setup for resolution, but for what I use it for, it is a five star value at Amazon's price! This camera will pay for itself in about 6 months with the savings on film and developing! My next purchase is the printer that Olympus makes for digital cameras. I had fun with the quicktime movie mode, even without sound, it's a fun extra. The LCD display is easy to read, altho on a sharp angle, is harder to see. Great for taking those candid shots... no one realizes you are using the camera!<br />The only negative thing I can say about it is the way it turns on & off. You have to be careful how you close the cover, because if it hits the extended lens, it won't close altho you can hear the motor trying to. Cannot be too good for the motor.","I actually bought and returned 3 other cameras before deciding on this one.  It is an excellent camera.  The only negative thing is that you have to remember to put the flash up before taking pictures.  I highly recommend this camera.","After months of searching for an easy to use point and shoot 2.1-mega pixel camera.  I finally took the plunge and purchased a 490z.  I had the opportunity to test the following camera's (thanks to friends and family) Sony S50, Fuji FP2400, Canon S100 and the Olympus 490z.  My two main objectives were, picture quality and the ability to turn it on and shoot without messing with any settings. The Olympus wins hands down out of the four.  This camera is almost perfect!<br />Pros: amazing clarity and picture color both indoors and out, excellent flash range indoors, quick cycle and shutter lag times, easy to carry, great battery life with NiMH rechargeables (I use the view finder 90% of the time) Cons: no usb, you have to open the flash<br />Forget about what you've read about the sliding door to cover the lens, its no problem what so ever.  The menus are a little cryptic but 10 minutes with the manual and it's \"set it and forget it\".  No mic for the movies. Hello, I bought it for photo's, not movies.<br />I purchased the camera, Olympus 64mb card, Olympus USB Camedia Reader and a rechargeable AA battery kit for a little over $600.  I can't say enough about how pleased I am with this camera.  Anybody can take this camera out of the box and take excellent pictures with very little effort.","I recently upgraded from the Olympus D-340R to the D-490Zoom and I do not regret my decision! The D490 Zoom produces remarkable prints. One thing to consider though is that one must have an excellent printer, or another option is to upload your photographic treasures to and online company such as shutterfly.com or ofoto.com.  I want to dispute what one reviewer wrote. He stated that the Camedia program that comes with the camera was weak and that it had a slideshow option that only showed sample photos. He should go back and learn more about Camedia. Once you bring your photos into the Camedia program you choose the select all option and then go to the slideshow function and you will have an instant slideshow! You can also create wallpaper from any of your photos. Just do not choose a high resolution shot or it will be too large for your screen. I recently scanned some old slides of my husband in Korea. Many were faded a great deal. I was able to use the instant fix option in Camedia to bring back rich colors. Another plus to camedia is the ability to transfer any photos to another drive directly from Camedia. I have a Zip drive and I transfer all my photos that I want to keep to the Zip Drive by again choosing the select all function and dragging and dropping to the choosen drive just like using Windows Explorer. There are other excellent editing programs on the market, but Camedia will help with most simple editing needs. I pays to learn its functions.","After much research and reading customer reviews here at Amazon, I had narrowed my choice for a digital camera down to the Olympus D-460Z and the Olympus D-490Z.  I left the final decision to my husband to choose which one he wanted to buy for my Christmas gift.  He chose the 490Z and I couldn't be more pleased with this camera.  Never having used a digital camera I found it simple to use...was taking pictures within an hour of reading a bit about it & installing the software.  Some of the reviews that I have read had me concerned about the lens cover closing, but I find this to be an excellent feature and have not had any problems with that at all.  I haven't bought any accessories at this time, a rebate for a free USB reader was included with the camera & I have mailed that off.  I know that will speed the downloading process up a great deal.  Overall, I think the picture quality is excellent & the ease of using the camera is amazing.  I would certainly recommend this camera to anyone in the market for a digital camera.  The only thing I can say negative is the Camedia software is lame, it is not a program that I find helpful in editing the pictures.  I have several other programs that I am using instead.  I currently am using ULead PhotoImpact...I download the pictures directly from the camera into PhotoImpact & edit them for email or saving to my hard drive.  I also have Adobe PhotoShop, but haven't used it with the camera yet.  I would recommend that you consider buying another software program for editing your photos, but other than that...this is a terrific camera & I would certainly buy it again.  Thanks to all for the great reviews!  I found them most helpful in deciding which camera to purchase.","This is the best digital camera in the 2.1 megapixel class that I have seen! The pictures are crystal clear, and the camera itself is jam-packed with features. (The flash assembly doesn't feel flimsy to me at all.) The QuickTime movie mode is great for times when you want to capture a whole room, or a memorable moment that lasts for several seconds. The serial connection is not blazingly fast, but it isn't all that slow either; and it allows connection to older Macs and PCs without USB. There is also an offer for a free USB SmartMedia reader/writer if you have USB and want to take advantage of its speed. I had a problem with the serial connection at first, but Olympus's excellent online tech support service guided me straight to the problem (the HotSync software for my PalmPilot was using the COM port). I would highly recommend this camera for anybody wanting a simple yet powerful camera with lots of flexibility. This is my first digital camera, and I've loved it since the minute I got it.","I PURCHASED THE OLYMPUS D-490 DIGITAL CAMERA ON A WHIM.  I WAS GOING TO GREAT BRITAIN FOR THREE WEEKS & DECIDED THAT I NEEDED A DIGITAL CAMERA.  HAVING USED OLYMPUS CAMERAS IN THE PAST & THE PRICE BEING RIGHT BASICALLY THAT MADE MY DECISION.  IT PROVED TO BE A GOOD ONE.  AFTER TOURING ENGLAND, WALES & SCOTLAND FOR THREE WEEKS AND TAKING LOADS OF PHOTOS, I RETURNED HOME, DOWNLOADED THE SMART MEDIA CARD WITH A VIKING MEMORY READER AND DISCOVERED I HAD OVER 200 REALLY GREAT PHOTOS.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA FOR EASE OF USE, SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT IN A BACK PACK OR PURSE, GREAT COMPUTER PHOTOS & FUN TO USE.  HAPPY PHOTO TAKING JUST ABOUT ANY ONE COULD USE THIS CAMERA.","This is one of those magical products.  The camera case, while at first appearing to be some sort of plastic is really a surprisingly good quality metal, perhaps aluminum.  Olympus never compromises, you buy this camera with a feeling of confidence that the lens apparatus is of the highest optical quality, an invisible quality perhaps neglected by most other manufacturers, with the possible exception of Canon.<br />That said, your pictures come out true to life.  And I was pleasingly surprised by the quality of the indoor photos I received which were in most cases just as good without the flash as with it.  The color is always good and with the multitude of software available (I ended up with eight CD's without even having bought a software package, everything, even the photo paper comes with one) you can make the color even more vibrant if you wish!<br />Now on to the cons.  The sliding lens cap gets alarmingly close to but in my case always stops just short of hitting the extended lens before it slides in by itself before you can close it all the way, but it is by the smallest of margins!  I am supposing that they've tested this, and there is definitely a click stop, but I wouldn't want to accidentally 'slam' it one day.<br />As a final note, there is one item neglected in an otherwise nearly perfect instruction manual.<br />TO ACCESS SHG-TIFF:  You must hold the up arrow for two seconds as I found out only from an Amazaon review!  But I guarantee you'll hardly ever use this mode anyway.  Amazaon.com has better support than the manufacturers!<br />Anyone willing to invest in this fairly pricey camera will surely be most satisfied.  When you add the multitude of features that is sure to keep you reading for hours and the surprisingly inexpensive 'look' you will as well be sure to conclude after obtaining one that there is, indeed, a magical quality to this device.","I got my D-490 on December 13 2000 and I've already taken 4 dozen pictures with it (it's Christmas Day, 2000 today).  Once you figure out how to access the excellent capabilities it has, the camera's fine optics, good zoom, excellent auto ranging and f/stop-shutter speed, and simple editing procedures will win you over.  It also has very nice advanced features (e.g., white balance, manual ISO overides, resolution options, special flash functions, etc), so it's both a great snapshot camera for inexperienced users and it has plenty of features for experience photographers as well.  The user interface is strange - downright counter-intuitive at times.  For example, opening the lens cover turns the camera on (suppose I just want to wipe the lens off?), and you can't view images you've taken already unless the camera's turned off.  Also, the CaMedia software that comes with the camera is a pretty weak brew.  It starts with a gratuitous slide show that I find completely pointless and time-consuming to bring up (for no reason, since these aren't your pictures!).  Aside from downloading images, it's almost useless in my opinion.  The Photo Editor software that comes with your PC is more capable.  Also, a USB interface isn't standard - heresy in 2000 computer peripherals.  Bizarre interfaces and poor PC software aside, the D-490 is a superb digital camera!  I'd buy it again and recommend it to anyone - well, anyone willing to fight through the user interface to learn to use the powerful and useful features of this excellent and otherwise well-engineered tool.","I selected this camera based on Pixels, Price, and the reviews it got on Amazon. My whole family will be using this camera so I wanted something that would be easy to use. I also wanted good pictures and the 490's 3 X optical zoom and 2.1 Mega pixels deliver. We love the pictures we are taking and it is very easy to manipulate them with the included software.  We also bought a larger memory card which will come in handy on vacation, rechargeable batteries and an AC adapter which we use when upoading the pictures to the computer.<br />Uploads can take a while, so we will be buing a Viking flash reader soon.<br />This camera does not solve all the problems of digital cameras but it is a great buy for the price and Amazon was able to deliver it right away.","This is a gadget in the most basic sense.  For its intended use, it's phenominal; it takes excellent pictures at all resolutions, and it has exemplary electronics and optics for a small camera.  It provides strong automation features with good overides for ISO settings, white balance, down-stopping, and previewing pictures taken.  The back-plate screen is wonderful.  The user interface is cumbersome, however, and support software leaves much to desired.  You'll likely use the support software only for downloads.  Leave the processing to Photo House; it's just better software,  Additionally, the absence of a USB port (unforgivable in 2000) makes downloads slow.  My experience with the red-eye redux have been inconclusive; sometimes it helps, sometimes not.  It comes with an 8M SmartMedia card, which you will likely upgrade to 32M or more right away.  Overall, it's probably worth the hassles, though, because the results are spectacular.  I'd still buy it, problems notwithstanding.  My recommendations: buy the camera, upgrade the SmartMedia card, and get used to slow downloads.  Believe it or not, it's worth it.","This camera is what I call a \"must have thing\". The image quality is simply the best I ever seen on digital picturing. The price, worth it. It's not a expensive machine but has too many qualities. I read all the reviews at this webpage and found all them useful for me. And here are my pro and cons:<br />Pro: 1- image quality 2- easy to use 3- doesn't look as a expensive camera, so thiefs will not think it is a digital one, but a ordinary camera 4- software included 5- it records on the picture file data as apperture size, flash on or off, ISO and date on each picture (data read only by CAMMEDIA softwere) 6- very good flash action (with the SLOW fearture you can take pictures that the object is far from you but get bright pics) 7- optical viewfinder (economizes batteries... with my old CASIO QV-300 I had always to change batteries)<br />CONS: 1- data transfer... the serial port is too slow, I recommend a USB SMARTMEDIA READER 2- SmartMedia(TM) card is too small (only 8MB), recommend you buying too a extra card 3- some pictures took with the SLOW flash function get blured (but it was expected), so, needs a good hand or a tripod 4- it's too easy to delete ALL PICTURES! (my brother deleted all pictures from my prom last month.... no comments!) 5- the menu uses only symbols, so, it's easy to someone that doesn't deals with the camera constantly do something wrong, as my brother did<br />It is a good thing to buy, trust me, until today (17/Dec/2000) I didn't find another camera that I would buy instead of this. I bought it with a extra smartmedia(tm) card, a SanDisk(tm) 32MB. I'm now looking for a USB SmartMedia reader, a AC Adapter and batteries recharger.","This is the \"all-around\" best digital camera for the casual digital enthusiast.  It small enough to fit in your pocket, but rich enough in features and resolution to give you years of great memory capture.  The 3x optical zoom is the best reason to buy.  It's enough zoom to shorten most distance shots, but not so much zoom that you have a bulky lens.  The lens retracts behind a sliding shutter that keeps it cleans and safe from lens scratches while in your pocket.  The viewing screen is sharp and clear, and displays the additional zooming feature of the 2.5x digital zoom.  And because it's a 2.1 megapixel, these digitally zoomed shots retain their clarity.  Only drawback to this camera is a manual flip up flash.  One less thing to break, but causes you to miss some shots by not remembering to flip it up, (not a reason not to buy however).  Buy the 32mb SmartMedia card to get 70 shots on high quality mode.  And if you can, buy the Camedia Floppy Disc Drive adapter for transerring your shots at high speed from the SmartMedia card to your PC.","I bought this camera last weekend and also a Sandisk Smartmedia usb reader. I have already taken 60 pictures. The immediate gratification of sending pictures to my friends and family without the waiting for development is incredible. The software that comes with the camera is excellent and easy to use. I need to use Adobe photoshop, however, to reduce the picture size for my friends with dial up connections. This camera takes pictures that gives a great slide show on a 36\" TV with the included cable. With the USB card reader you can load pictures for TV viewing (Slick). The 8 meg card is good for a 15 second video. I am getting 20 stills on the 8 meg card. I am going to buy a 64 meg card this weekend. A previous poster said that the card reader saved battery life and it seems to be true. There is a rebate offer now for a free card reader but I couldn't wait. The free card reader will make a great Christmas present (late!) for your friends or family with a Diamond Rio. For those posters that complained about installation problems, buy a DELL computer.","This is a great little camera. The pictures were execellent in the HQ and SHQ modes (1600x1200), the SQ mode (640x480) was okay for posting on the web. I have a 35mm Olympus XA2 which is almost the same size so I am comfortable with the D490Zoom. If you're the type of person who's in a rush all the time you might want to get a different camera as you do have to wait a few \"long seconds\" for the lens to come out or go back in when open/close the front sliding lens cover. It isn't a big deal for me. Also the flash doesn't present a problem to me and I like the fact that I can control if it is up or down. You do have to be careful when closing the sliding lens cover (but I haven't lost a lens cap yet either).<br />The only negative I found was that the manual mentioned the 5 modes but didn't say how to get to SQ-HIGH and SHQ-TIFF. But there was a smaller quick-start booklet that tells you to hold on the up arrow for 2 seconds to get to the other two modes.<br />I found the menus (one for picture-taking and one for pictrue-viewing) real easy to navigate thru and the icons made sense to me (kind of scary). I ordered the bare camera and not the extras.","After using this camera for the last few weeks I found that it has exceeded my expectations.  The camera has enough nice features to make it a pleasure to use without overwhelming the user with too much configurability.<br />The two things I like about the camera the most are the ability to take rapid sequence pictures and the quality of the flash.  The rapid sequence capability allows you to take actions shots (like kids playing soccer) without the standard 2-3 second delay.  The camera has an onboard cache that allows HQ quality pictures to be taken at a sub-second rate. The flash is adequate at illuminating an entire room with enough light to capture a quality picture.<br />Accessories that I have found useful are 2 sets of rechargable batteries, Viking USB reader for the flash card and another flash card.","Had the camera about 2 weeks and it works flawlessly.  IT NEEDS A USB capability but works great with the Camedia software supplied with the camera.  The pics are fantastic.  The serial download takes forever so grab that USB card reader with your purchase. I'd buy it again in a second.","First off, i would like to suggest that the writer of the previous review check which product he or she is bashing before posting a review with starred ratings.<br />The Olympus D490 camera is worth your wait. I have been watching the market, waiting for the digital camera that would take high quality photos and would be balanced as a camera. I have broken the plusses and minuses of the review below for your reading ease<br />Plusses + Size (At first I was almost dissapointed that the camera was so small. I have been used to seeing digital cameras that were huge and unweildy. The D490 Actually is the same size as film using relatives in the Olympus family. If you use the optical viewfinder instead of the LCD screen, most people wont have a clue that you even are using a digital camera)<br />+ Ease of use (The D490 is very easy to use. The included software makes downloading the images easy, and the camera operates like any other regular camera.)<br />+ Pictures (The pictures are beautiful. They are huge and vivid.)<br />+ Speed (The camera uses a RAM buffer to store the images temporarily as they are written to the EEPROM Chip. What this means is that you are able to take multiple photos while the camera is writing the pictures to memory. This is a marked advantage over the D460, and is discussed in another user's review)<br />+ Reliability (I've had it a few months, never had a problem yet.)<br />+ Movies! (This camera takes 15 second high quality movies! It also has an option to take low quality 60 second movies, however since the high quality movies only have a resolution of 320 by 240, the low quality ones really are worthless... for reference i think they are 160 by 120)<br />Minuses<br />- Software problems (I think it may just be the software i got since i havent heard anyone else complain in this area, but my camedia software cannot splice together the panoramic shots.... oh well... i didnt buy the camera solely for this purpose so it doesnt bother me so much)<br />- Movies dont have sound<br />- Lack of USB connectivity (This feature is a must these days, and although i did get a Viking USB card reader, it would have been a great feature to add one into the camera to begin with)<br />Overall i think this camera is GREAT. Digital cameras are still a bit pricey for most people, and really the consumer is still paying a hefty chunk of the R+D costs instead of the manufacturing costs, however when a company produces such a high quality product such as this one, i dont really mind it.<br />If you want a digital camera buy this one.","After reading reviews posted below I deicded D490 to be my first digital camera.  I took advices to go out buy a Delkin reader-4 ..., 8 NiMh batteries..., a charger ..., one 32MB smart media card ..., Microsoft Picture it ... all at local Fry store.  The result is hundreds of great outdoor photos and few family movies over this thankgiving weekend.  Comparing to my other SLR Olympus camera baught at over ... used with a  scanner, this camera does comes out greater pictures on the computer screen, plus it's lots more efficient and convenient.  The ability to instantly view zoomed new shots surprises friends and kids too.  This is a great product at this price.","I am an absolutely electronically disadvantaged so was on the lookout for a great camera that was easy to use, and didn't cost an arm and a leg. This camera met both criteria quite easily and takes phenomenal photos. On my personal website Italian Food Forever, I like to put photos online with each of my recipes, and the photos I take with this camera have gotten many compliments. Although I still haven't investigated all the various options available with this camera, I found I was able to use it and take exceptional photos after a brief run through of the manual. If you are looking for a great camera at a reasonable price, that doesn't take a physic's degree to operate, I would suggest looking into buying this one.","This Olympus 490 is my very first digital camera, but I've been getting recommendations from friends for about six months.  I chose the Olympus brand simply because several friends who owned this brand said they were the simplest to use.  I had my eye on the 460, but when Amazon lowered the price on both, I decided to save and get this one.  I love it!!  You can spend a weekend reading the manual and playing with all the features, or you can read the quick instructions and take your first pics ten minutes after you get the box open.  There are lots of choices on resolution, and zoom is a great feature.  This camera also takes panorama shots and quick time movies.  You download to your computer using a serial port, which although people tell me it's slow, I find extremely handy, as I can use almost any computer - my one at work, home, my boyfriend's house, etc., without worrying whether or not there is USB support.  Also, I did have to call Olympus tech support to ask a simple question, and I got a very friendly, extremely helpful guy who answered my question in two mnutes flat.  You can't beat that service!  An excellent little product that I'm *very* happy with.","I just bought my D490 so I can take pictures and send them to my parents and friends. This was definately money well spent. The camera is user friendly, just point & shoot. It has a great zoom and it's very light. I love it and highly recommend it.","Very happy with this camera! Took great photos without any previous digital camera experience. My first photos at company event were better than those from other more expensive cameras...and results are improving as I utilize more of the camera's functions.  Highly recommend Olympus P330 printer as well --no flexibility with print size, but excellent color rendition.","I have not used this camera, rather the D360L.  However, when I upgraded to Windows ME (to take advantage of \"My Pictures\" and the built-in digital camera stuff), my camera wouldn't work.  It wasn't in the driver list, so I contacted Olympus.<br />This was my response (read - \"doesn't work - we're not doing anything abount it\")<br />\"The newer Olympus digital camera models -- D360L, D400Z, D450Z, D460Z,  D490Z, C2000Z, C2020Z, C211Z, C2500L, C3000Z, C3030Z, and the C21 -- are not designed to use twain drivers, plug-ins, or the mini-apps to  communicate with the computer.  The Olympus Camedia utility software  communicates with these camera models to download (copy) your picture  files into a folder on your computer harddrive where they can be  accessed by any software program that can use jpeg or tiff formatted  graphic files.  Only the following Olympus digital cameras are twain  compliant:  D200L, D220L, D300L, D320L, D340L, D340R, D500L, D600L, and  D620L.  Only the D200L and the D300L can not communicate using Camedia. \"","My camera just arrived 2 days ago. It's the first digital camera I've used and it's wonderful! It's easy to work and the pictures are beautiful. Worth the investment.","AOL is advertising two digital cameras.  One of them costs[more than] $200 and with barely any memory and 640x480 resolution!  They are also advertising another camera with 2mb space and 240x480 resolution!<br /><br /> Now, if you are looking for a digital camera in order to create GOOD pictures, then I'll give you some pointers:<br /><br /> 1)It should have optical zoom<br /> 2)It should come with AT LEAST 8mb of storage space<br /> 3)Smartmedia is more convenient than compact flash<br /> 4)Sony cameras that require memory sticks are NOT GOOD (they could easily change their memory format soon, and they are the only company with memory sticks)<br /> 5)It should have about 1084x1280 resolution or more in order for it to come out good<br /> 6)Always remember that you can always buy more memory for your camera, so don't worry about that too much (the memory does cost a lot, however)<br /> 7)Go to activebuyersguide.com for their opinion (that's what I did)<br /> 8)Most importantly, if you don't find anything better, GET THIS AWESOME CAMERA!<br /><br />Good Luck!","I almost took a point off because this camera doesn't have a USB port, but  I found a SanDisk USB card reader locally for $40.  Amazon didn't sell this  reader at the time I write this.  The card reader is a necessity, a full  16MB card will take about 20 seconds to transfer with the reader, using the  serial port you can go have lunch or something while it downloads.  NiMH  batteries are also a necessity, for the price of a few lithium batteries  you can get 8 NiMH batteries and a charger, that way you can always have a  set charged up.<br />Image quality is excellent.  I was looking at the C3030  and couldn't see spending that much for a few extra features and another  million pixels.  Unless you plan on printing out 8x10 prints the extra  resolution isn't needed, use the extra money on accessories.  Printing the  D490 HQ images at 3x5 inches they look as good as 35mm prints.  I have run  several tests shooting the same image using all the modes of the camera and  found the best mode to use is normal HQ, under certain conditions SHQ will  give you  better color reproduction and slightly sharper edges.  The  SHQ-TIFF mode images are huge and I have yet to see any difference between  it and SHQ mode, even in macro mode with a complex object the images look  the same.  As for the soft setting and the digital zoom, you are better off  taking a normal HQ image and using software on the computer to soften or  resize.<br />The QuickTime movie feature is fun to play with, kinda like  having an old 8mm movie camera.  I like the fact that you have to raise the  flash manually, if you don't want to use the flash you know it's off when  it's down.  That's better than having to find a button and look at a  display to tell if you've turned it off.<br />The size, price, and image  quality make this a great camera to have.","I upgraded from the Olympus D460Zoom to the D490Zoom. The D460 is a fine camera - I was generally very pleased with it. But having owned the  D460Zoom for six months, I found two major faults. First, the \"boot-up  time\" (how quickly after you turn the camera on that it is ready to  shoot) and the lack of \"burst\" shooting (the ability to take one  shot quickly after another). These two faults lead to frustration when  trying to take any type of action photos with the D460. You see the action  emerging, but the camera is still booting up; you take a shot, but the  action gets better and you want to take another but the D460 says \"not  yet\" because it is still writing the first photo to the media.  Infuriating.<br />The D490 addresses each of these problems beautifully. Boot  up time is about 20% faster. Timing both of my cameras side-by-side, the  D490 is faster (1.1 seconds versus 1.3 seconds, in five trials using the  same 32Mb media cards). More important than boot up time is burst shooting.  The D490 has a RAM buffer that allows you to take about 1 shot per second  in the \"HQ\" mode (2.1 megapixels with JPEG compression). The D460  requires about 2.5 seconds between shoots in the same \"HQ\" mode  (but the resolution is 1.3 megapixels). Also nifty if you are using the TFT  screen to take shots, there is a \"gas gauge\" showing you how full  the memory buffer is as you are shooting.<br />I simply can't express how  happy these faster response time made me, especially at this price. I was  so unhappy with the D460's sluggishness that I was about to buy the $900  Olympus C3030. Similar to the C3030, the D490 also can take QuickTime  movies (though much shorter ones). Another nice D490 feature is that you  can erase all photos off a card while the card is still in the camera,  instead of having to do the erasing on your computer (I often forget to  erase after downloading to the computer, put the media card back in and  find it still full when I want to take more pictures).<br />While the D490  lacks the C3030's B&W options it does have the two more important  features - the QuickTime movies and the burst shooting (both admittedly not  as good as the C3030, but likely good enough for most of us). Beyond the  $400 saving, the D490 still retains a much smaller footprint; it can easily  slip into a pants or shirt pocket.<br />As for the enhancement from 1.3 to  2.1 megapixels (D460 vs D490), I can't really tell much difference. I took  two identical shots both \"HQ\" mode, printed them 4x6 on my  HP970Cxi; they look the same. Currently the D490 is about $100 more than  the D460. I would say the \"burst\" shooting alone is easily worth  the extra money. Go and get one! Shoot happy!","After purchasing the D490, I found this camera extremely easy to operate  and to be the best digital camera for this price, that not only takes still  shots, but also MPEG movies. Depending on the quality of picture you  require, you can store hundreds of picture on the 32mb smartcard, which I  purchased in addition to the 8mb card included in the package. 60 second  MPEG movies can be recorded and played back with ease. There is an  abundance of flash, editing and viewing features on the camera. The D490 is  lightweight (in fact, most of the weight is the batteries) and easy to use,  although on the downside, I find that the manually operated shutter closing  mechanism to be slightly awkward as the lens has to retract fully before  the shutter can close completely. Also, the flash has to be opened  manually, and I found it to be a bit fragile, and was always worried that I  might just pull it off accidentally.","I upgraded from the Olympus D460Zoom to the D490Zoom.

Aside from the convenient CD storage, the camera takes absolutely super pictures.  This camera's possibilities are endless.  Recently, I purchased a wide-angle lense with macro capabilities for this camera and I was able to photograph and read the microscopic print on the new bill.  On the right bottom of President Lincoln's picture, the words \"The United States Of America\" are printed so microscopic that you cannot detect any text, let alone read it, with the naked eye.  My camera with added lense took a very clear picture of the text.","While I do not personally own this camera, my younger brother does and I have seen the beautiful, high quality photographs that he is able to take with it. The pictures are so sharp that they are breath-taking. I suspect this is due to the Zeiss lens. It is also easy to frame the subject in any light because it has a good view finder whereas many of the newer models rely solely on the LCD screen which is hard to use in bright sunlight or in low-light situations. The nicest feature is the ability to store photographs on the 3\" CD, which then comes out of the camera and goes directly into a standard CD drive on your PC. This mode of storage allows the photographer to take hundreds of shots while in the field without having to download a memory stick or memory card after 19 or 38 (depending upon the size of the memory card)to a PC. The small CDs are easily transported in the camera bag and make the camera a real winner in my book. I particularly like the the view finder over the LCD screen for ease of framing the subject and getting the best results. If this camera had had a slightly higher pixel rating, I would have given in five stars, but from the pictures my brother has sent to me and the ones I have seen printed in 8X10 framed pictures, I have been sold on this camera. Absolutely the most professional looking pictures I have ever seen from an amateur photographer. Color saturation and accuracy are also top notch. It has all the right features to suit my needs.","I'm a Forensic Technician and I've been using a 35mm Nikon N70 for awhile. The Mavica CD1000 is so handy. I can take my usual shots and know instantly if they've come out. The CD held 172 pictures on one disc and I got 160 pictures on another disc. There were reasons for this since I used the \"talk\" mode on some pictures to record what I was observing. I like the zoom mode since ,with it I'm not necessarily having to get down into the muck and the mud with the camera. Having and needing certain requirments from my equipment I would like to see a higher  magnification on THIS camera, but since my work generally is close up and detailed it does fine. I had to make my own carrying case since I need more attachments than just the camera allows and I needed a hard case due to the rigors of the job. The batteries have a descent life and allows me to usually complete one job prior to changing the batteries, even with other officers viewing the pictures without getting into my scenes. I esp. like the fact I can charge a battery  in the camera. For evidentiary purposes the CD \"non-rewritable\" discs are great in that the cost for one is not that much different than for one roll of regular 35mm film.(36 count 200 asp) The digital aspects are comparable to other digital cameras I guess but for the CD aspects for evidentiary purposes, time allowed on a battery life, and the ease of substitutting this camera for the 35mm and instant camera is so much easier to take your equipment with you. The \"digital\" displays are clear and like any camera you have to learn its nuances and capabilities. I've just recently obtianed this camera, it is my first digital camera used, and I'm not having any trouble with the camera yet. It is a large digital camera but is comparable in size to the Nikon I'm still using now. The CD's are small enough to fit in your pocket and I can carry two CD's where as I'd have to carry 9 rolls of 35mm film 36 count. The anti-shake feature is very handy in that I'm not able to pick the times and conditions of my being out to take pictures. I wish the assesories where easier obtianed for the camera. I wish the tripod mount had a little more surface area for secure mounting. I also would like to see the flash attachment have a different mount screw/clamp. This one doesn't tighten up good enough and stay tight for camera manipulation in tight spots and odd angle takes. I guess I'm having more Problems with the accessories than with the camera proper but for what I need they go hand in hand.","Hi, I just bought this camera last week in Manila with the price of 625usd (included VAT) so I guess this is a good deal. I have been looking for a digital camera for a long time and after searching internet for quite a long time, finally, I got what I really dream of...for myself. This is my first digital camera and I love it... I have always loved SONY digital camera and certainly I am not disappointed about this camera at all. The only complaint is the bulky size of the camera...<br />This camera rocks...I also a little confused between other SONY digital camera such as DSC-S75 but I love the 10X optical lens of this one so... I picked CD1000 instead...<br />The writing speed of this camera is not that bad as a lot of people here mentioned. It take me around 2 seconds to write the images on the CD-R.<br />I have taken a lot of pictures of my 6 months old baby...<br />I love the quality except a little underexpose quality if your pictures taken with dim light (indoor).<br />I would certainly recommend this camera to everyone.<br />Andy","I got this camera for Christmas and I absolutely love it. I already have the Mavica fd-83 but wanted to upgrade. The fd-83 worked well but I had heard that the picture quality was even better on the CD1000 (which it definetly is) and as convenient as the floppy disks were to put in the computer they were kind of inconvenient to carry around. As a budding photographer I had to carry a lot around and change them frequently. The max I ever got on a floppy was 13, and that was using black and white, compared to a cd's 100+.<br />Although the size is larger than most cameras I was surprised at how lightweight it is. And though it may look bulky it fits very comfortably in your hand. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this camera. The only complaint I have is minimal. Unlike, the fd-83 it doesn't have a button on the camera to change the picture type(b&w, sepia, etc.). You have to go in through the menu to change it. Only a slight inconvenience and only because I am used to having it right at my fingertips.<br />P.S. You can take action shots with this camera. Like, all Sony Mavica's when you press down the button half way it auto-focuses and a green light comes on. Then you push down the rest of the way to take the picture. In cases where you're taking action shots you simply keep the button pushed down half-way in preparation for your shot. I really wouldn't call it a flaw. Its just something you have to get used to. After getting my first Mavica it took me only a few days to get the hang of it.","This little gem is the world of digital cameras -- I wouldn't trade it for anything but a professional model.  First off, the cd media is the most convenient and best storage method around -- you can store more pictures at higher resolution for the most convenience.  And the Sony 3\" disk prices aren't that unreasonable (...).  Granted, it is a still camera only, if you're looking for plenty of video options, look elsewhere.  But for the camera enthusiast, the 15 seconds of video is a novelty item.<br />The size may seem a bit bulky at first, but Sony has tailored the camera's ergonomics perfectly, no matter HOW you like to hold the camera.<br />I shoot most pictures in 1600 x 1200 just so that I have the flexibility of blowing them up later and usually can fit anywhere from 130-150 pictures on each disk.<br />My only complaints are that it doesn't perform well in very dark setting without an stronger flash added on and for the 'quick shooter' it may seem slow -- it takes about 5 seconds to write the image to the disk, so you can't shoot in rapid sucession.  But you're not going to find any camera that can write much faster than that.","the size is big, for me that was a great feature because it fits my hand, the weight of the camera is not a problem though.  I love the fact that the camera has a cd burner.  Less wires to hook up, just put the cd in your pc or laptop run the software and go.  It has it's own formats on the camera itself, many to choose from plus a delete if I happened to get a bad picture by accident. You get one chance otherwise it is burned for good.<br />The advantage of the zoom for me is outdoor wildlife pictures (hunting type- big game, and all the wildlife and nature shots) and scenery.  It is awesome for this.  I did buy a flash for it so that I could get better pictures of my twins' basketball pictures, another advantage of that zoom as well.  Also, I bought a lens to keep out the dust when I am taking horse pictures in the corral,my little girl on her horse, or working cattle pictures by horses-I have carried this camera on my horse as well. The battery that I have lasts a long time, so that I can get a whole BB game on it,the stills and some in movie mode.  the advantage of getting the 15 second plus movie option (as well as still shot) is great for those free shots, jumpshots, running plays, etc.  One thing that I do not like about it is it is very slow.  So, I have learned to anticipate the picture that I want to capture when it is an action shot.  Still shots-well, then it is an advantage.  Just gives a person time to get things set for perfect shots.  I wish that it had a self timer for family pictures so that I can get in some of them, but that's all right, I will lose 25 pounds first-lol.  I have taken some family pictures for relatives.  The advantage of the mini disc is that it will burn up to 180 pictures+ and more. If the movie mode is used, well it takes up more space and you have to use more cds.  I might buy a 2x zoom and another battery the next purchase, we'll see.  Also, I bought my mini CDs on auction by the 100's so I don't have to worry about that aspect of reorders,etc.  So, I guess, if you buy this--enjoy shooting a lot of pictures because, I figure it is something like a penny or 2 pennies a picture.  Not bad for heirlooms and enjoyment.  fun to email. I love my camera-mvc cd1000 by Sony Mavica Awesome photo fun-char","I have owned this camera for about 1 year, and am very pleased with it.  The best feature it has is the CD. When you are on vacation you do not need to worry about running out of storage, you can just put in a new disk.  No plugging the camera into a computer to download pictures, just pop the disk into the drive. No need to use a lot of computer memory to store pictures on your hard drive, there is a permanent record on disk.  The disks run about $5 each, about the same as a roll of film.<br />I only have two negative comments. The video is worthless, the quality is terrible. The LCD is sometimes hard to see if you are not in a well lit location (the picture comes out fine).","I got this camera to upgrade from an earlier Sony that took the 3.5, 1.44 mb disks. What a pain those disks were! The upscale to 150 shots on the cd disk from only 12 on a 3.5 disk is one of the major benefits for me. Also I had been waiting for a camera that had a date option on it also, because 20 years from now I will want to know when the photo was taken. I also like the fact that I can just put the disk in my CD drive and copy the files to my hard drive for editing with my Thumbs Plus database program. The controls are easy to operate and I really like the zoom levels. Yes, it is a bit slow to snap the picture and stick it on the cd disk but all in all this to me is a minor problem considering the form factor of a cd disk which is what I think is a disruptive technology breakthrough. No way I will use a memory stick or even a usb port when I have the mini disk form that this camera has.","This camera is the best digital camera I have used. I am a teacher and have had the opportunity to try several other brands of digital cameras as well as other Sony models. This by far is the best.  The viewfinder/LCD screen option makes it great in strong sunlight as well as other times.","You can't believe it! The looks of envy from other camera owners is just the start. Using this camera is pure joy. I've taken 293 pics so far on the 1st of 5 discs included.I've found that the 640 x 480 resolution looks perfect for emails, web site use and printing, and at that resolution I can get over 1000 pictures per disc. The manual states for email it uses a smaller resolution, but what you  display on the LCD can be captured straight onto email or used on your web page. And get this...you can zoom your taken picture size with the zoom lever and print out the close up view. The slideshow feature is excellent for presentations being the time interval can be set for narrating during playback. And with audio pics you can speak about your subject for up to a minute while taking the picture. Also using the movie mode allows both action shots and sound recording of your event.For birding with a camera, the color viewfinder and 10X optical zoom is excellent for that golden-cheeked warbler in the Texas Hill Country or for hawks at the Cape May Birding Observatory with a picture to show. Pictures of photos hanging on the wall look like you took it yourself. Postcard prints do likewise. I amaze myself each time I use this camera - The SONY MVCCD1000.","I own a Sony Mavica and I realy injoy it before I was buying 15-25 rolls of film a month the antisapation of not knowing If my pictures turned out or not was hell, with my Mavica I know right there on the river or were ever Im at. This camera was the best investment I ever made, I have 6 cameras or more and I have not used any of them sence my Mavica, I have taken pictures of spiders to ants and they are all great. The ones I took with hornet nests were great.","I love this camera.  This is the camera that has converted me from using standard film to \"going digital.\"<br />Without the cost restraints of standard film or the space restraints that digital camera memory place upon the number of pictures I take I feel free to take as many pictures of I want at no risk.  This results in far more pictures per event than I would normally have taken.<br />The automatic aspects of the camera work great.  It is extremely rare for a shot to be out of focus or exposed improperly.  Out of appx. 1000 vacation shots I took in August only 1 or 2 were inexplicably out of focus and only a handful more were too dark, and those were due to the lighting conditions themselves being far too dark for taking pictures.<br />The camera is large and bulky compared with almost every other digital camera but is lighter than any SLR I have ever used.  The lens is big and provides a remarkably wide range (10x optical times 2 digital - total 20x zoom - excellent).  Shots taken at 20x zoom are not pixelated in the least!<br />At the highest resolution I get somewhere between perhaps 100 and 180 images on a third party 3\" CDR (less than $1 each).  At the lowest resolution it looks like one could get in excess of 1000 shots onto a CD.<br />The single drawback I find with this camera is that during a day of really busy shooting it can really drain the rechargable batteries.  I keep a spare (charged) battery on hand.  We spent a 9 hour day at Disney this summer and I used 1.5 charges during the course of the day.","The CD solves the image storing problem. I love the slide show feature, after a party plug it into the TV and everyone can watch the show. Pictures are fine displayed on a 50 inch big screen.<br />Battery life is long enough to make the camera useful for a day's shooting.<br />However it doesn't replace a good manual Pentax K100 with slide film for anything other than normal photos as there is a delay from shutter push until the photo is taken and it averages the image (light and dark) causing difficuly if the image isn't lit evenly.<br />The auto focus does work quite well. It has focused and taken good photo's in location were I cannot hardly see the subject myself until the flash goes off.","I bought this camera mostly because of the CD recording system. The idea of little flash memory cards and a 10 month old in the same building gave me cold sweats.<br />That said, the camera is fantastic. The pictures are sharp and clear, and the resolution is fantastic. The first real shot I took with it (my daughter covered in baby food) was so sharp, you could actually see the fine print on her baby outfit.<br />I did have the same problem with the \"press the button and the image freezes, pauses, and then takes the picture of whatever it's pointing at then.\" But, after searching the manual, I discovered the answer. If you press the button half-way down, the little green light flashes, and then goes solid. From then on, squeezing the button the rest of the way takes an instant picture of what's being shown. I have some great shots of my son playing baseball with the bat and the ball caught in frame.<br />Admittedly, that fact should have been printed in big bold letters on page two instead of fine print on page 47, but that's the fault of the tech-writers.<br />So far, my only complaint is that pictures seem to be dark indoors, and the flash tends to overexpose rather than illuminate. Most of this can be avoided with the \"spot meter\" setting though, so I can't complain too much.<br />Overall, I would recommend anyone who wants a serious camera to get this one. With after-market disks at about 50 cents each, I just bought 50 disks that should cover my picture taking for the next five years or so. Now that's the kind of economy I like for cameras.","This is one GREAT camera! The quality of the images, the flexibility, the ease of use... All are far, far better than any other video camera I checked out. True, it is a husky devil, but the size and weight are diven by features! I am sure glad I stuck it out and waited until I could get this camera... I can see this gem to a great extent displacing my \"real\" camera which is a Nikon FTN Photomic.","... This camera is well worth every penny. I should know, I bought it for more than Amazon is charging now, and it was still worth the price. Consider that the other camera I wanted only comes with one 8MB Memory Stick, this has five 156MB CD-Rs included. To get the other 148MB on Memory Stick for that other camera, I would have had to pay about $300-500 more. Those 156MBs can be found for around $1.50ea in bulk. This camera has endless features, and takes awesome pictures. I should know, I took mine all the way to Korea to document a recent trip. I use it for everything....it even lets you do movies up to 1 minute long. Even at the largest digital image setting (1600x1200) you can save about 140-150 images on one disk. In film that would be about 6 rolls, at $5-6ea...Come on people, use some common sense. This camera will actually save you money. I have disks set up for all different occasions, family moments, architecture, the dog, Cardinal baseball games, Korea trip, etc....It's great, I can keep a whole library of disks, and switch them out as I go along. Everywhere I go, people ask me about it, what it can do, etc. What you don't have one yet????","I,myself, use to take photos with 35mm film-based cameras a lot since I was 12. I had a chance to test and try several digital cameras from 1 Megapixel to 3 Megapixel but never own one. I prefer something similar to my SLR cameras not an instant camera. So I decide to buy this sony,well, I have this camera since May 2001. At first, I had to adjust myself to get along with control panel, electronic viewfinder. It took about only 20-30 minutes to learn to whole features and getting test. This camera does a really good job on most shots. Feeling like taking by SLR camera, for examples-feeling when take shots, lighting and vivid output. It has a problem with low-light situations when seeing from viewfinder or LCD panel, but doing twilight plus technique (one of nice features in this camera) I can shoot night time photo with no problems - with flash / without flash. Also lag-time wasn't any problem for me because I used to test some other digital cameras that having this delaying picture. By pressing HALF-SHUTTER and waiting for nice moment will solve problem. Excellent zoom (Optical+Digital) - very impressive image stabilizer. About the battery life, I can use it the whole day(taking photos for 2.5 hours) when I went out. It's very ok to me because other cameras that I've used consume very much battery power (one hour and that's it). Moreover, I don't have to worry about my storage for pics and don't worry about when to upload photos to my PC. They're already there and permanently stored, that's why I don't have to make some more backing up to CD Media again and again (if I use wired-memory media cam). Once again in Thailand, we can get one 3\"-CD for a price only 1 US dollar. I am very happy with it then. I made my good decision on this great camera.<br />Conclusion: Great Picture quality, Great battery life and hugh storage. Low-light shooting + Motion may be some problem but need to adjust shutter speed and your own shooting techniques. Excellent zoom. Camera weight doesn't bother me at all, hugh but lighter than others.","I've had this camera for 4 months now and could not be more delighted. Recording photos on the 3\" disc is what separates this camera from the rest. At the highest reolution you can take 150 pictures on one disc - amazing. You now have a permanent record without any need to take up any computer space. You can put it on \"picture show\" and look at every photo on your projection TV and they all look great. If you don't like the angle-rotate the photo. You don't like the photo, delete it. The 10x telephoto with steady shot is great. I would not buy any digital camera without a CD storage system and this is the only camera that has it, as far as I know. In the summer of 2001 Sony will be coming out with smaller CD-R cameras without the long telephoto you have on this camera. The only drawback to the 1000 is the 1 second delay between pressing the button and taking the picture. It takes planning at times and sometimes you get odd results. Just delete the photo and do it again if the photo is poor. All in all a great camera. Last Saturday I took 150 photos at a wedding in Hyannis. With film it would have been only 20-40, but for the price why not 150 - all on one permanent disc.","Although I have had my Sony Mav CD1000 for only a few months, I have learned several important things...<br />It is very good for stills, but action shots are left better to chance.  The shutter seems to be delayed about one second, therefore, your moving object will not be in the picture as you first saw it (in \"Still\" mode).  Email format is good, while maintaining full JPEG file sizes.  Still images are wonderful and the digital zoom is incredible.  The cost of CD's is worth the trade whever you consider that you can skip the film processing.  If you are wanting to \"GO DIGITAL\" and \"PAPERLESS\" the CD1000 is great.  Data can be read by CDR-RW drives without \"Finalizing\" the disk...which saves time and space. If you really want to consider buying the CD1000, find someone who owns one, and take it out for a great day of picture taking.  Thanks to Sony!","I purchased one of these.  After I got it, it took me 5 minutes of reading the excellent manual to figure out how to use it...(read about initializing and finalizing the CD).  I proceeded to take about 20 pictures in bright sunlight, shade, very dim light, animals, flowers, trees blowing in the wind (to test the steady shot).  I took the CD and inserted it in my generic WIN 95 conputer with a color printer attached. Within 5 minutes, I had opened a WORD document, created a title, and by repeating the simple sequence of \"Insert picture\" (from the cd drive)and titling each picture with a piece of text, I created an index of 3 pages with each picture (about 2\"\"X1.5\"\").  I personally sized them by corner pulling. I printed some of the pictures particularly dear to my heart, in draft quality (8x11)  on reqular paper. They came out fabulous.  They were from recording in \"Normal\" mode.  I have owned many leading edge of technology video, still, and video/still cameras.  NOthing I have ever seen matches the simplicity and power of this camera.  You can record a sort audio title with each picture, so when creating your index (NO SPECIAL SOFTWARE!!! Just Microsoft word), you can label your picture!!","... about the slow shutter issue.  Embed a memory stick/flash card in addition to Cd-r capability.  I suspect that the shutter issue is due to cd-burning limitations and therefore would be really hard to address on a portable device (it is meant for stationary platforms -- pc, stereos, etc.).  If you embed a memory stick that flushes the data to cd-r, then you get the best of both worlds -- speed of flash memory and the portability of cd-r!","Welp,<br />I have owned a few cameras in the past couple of years and once I saw this one writing onto little compact discs, I was ready to jump all over this one.<br />I must admit, at first I was a little dismayed by the reviews I saw in here about it being horribly slow at recording and so on.  I was also dissapointed to see the 15-60 second limit on recording time.<br />However, as soon as I pulled this one together and took it out, I was absolutelty thrilled.  I use this one a lot for nature shots, getting pictures of the ocean, trees, cliffs and that kind of thing.  Without filters this camera seems to take some of the more amazingly vivid pictures I have seen.  The LCD display does little justice to the shot, but once you hook it up to your computer and wait the 30 or 40 minutes it takes to transmit all the pictures with the software included, your eyes will be pleasantly suprised.  The size does not bother me at all, even though I thought it would have.  I have had no problem with that other then the fact that I cannot fit this one in my coat pocket or something.  The weight seems about the same as a soda can, and even standing there waiting for the perfect shot to come along with the camera to my face for a good twenty minutes did not make my arms tired.  All of my friends are always very impressed, and dying to see the new pictures that I have taken.  I enjoy the media, being only that its a very cool thing to be carrying the three inch cd's around.  As well as the 156 meg size on them.  A pack of 5 of them will cost you 20 bucks, plus the camera comes with 5.  I have taken over 200 shots and I'm only halfway through my second disc.  I've had it since December.  No, you cannot delete the pictures, but if you're going from a film camera this will not matter too much.  The case is a bit of a joke.  Its a bikeseat for 50$.  The battery life is about 140 minutes fully charged with the LCD off in camera mode.  I have to see, taking pictures or short little movies I am thoroughly, without a doubt glad that I bought this camera.<br />John","I purchased a camera last year (another 2.1 mg) and was shocked at the $$ in hidden costs so sent it back. It needed more memory and ate batteries like there was no tomorrow. Six months later I purchased this sony and I continue to be delighted with it and am relaxed about the price.  When I added on the cost of extra storage media and batteries that most other cameras demand I concluded that the MVC-CD1000 wasn't so far off the mark after all. I recommend you do not buy the camera case - its shamefully expensive (for a bit of vinyl) and doesn't protect a thing.  Considering the size of the camera I swapped my handbag for a daypack (small backpack) which has several compartments & carries the camera, cables, discs etc plus all my girl stuff - perfect for a day out or holidaying as my main bag.  The zoom is great - better than my friends camera which was supposedly the same range. Some scenery shots have a green tinge to them - I noticed this in Steve's digicam review and I haven't worked out how to sort it out yet.  But its only a very small minus. The biggest bugbear is the delay before taking the photo (so aptly described by Ken McKenzie review).  (:-)It can test your humour if your subject matter keeps walking out of the photo frame)! My bottom line though - This camera is pure fun!","This is my first digital camera.  It doesn't quite replace my 35mm setup, but for sheer point and shoot ability it's great.<br />Upside:  CDR let's you shoot for ever.  Amazing low light capabilities.  Nice zoom coverage.  Steady shot is extremely useful.  Good collection of auto exposure modes.  Light weight.  Great resolution.  Nice special effects abilities.  Good battery life<br />Downside:  Built in flash is a joke.  Manual modes are problematic.  Manual could be more informative.  USB cable port in a bad spot if you want to leave a quick release tripod shoe on it.  Time from when you push the button till the shutter closes requires psychic powers in action situations.  It's ultra low light capabilities are non existant.  It could use a remote trigger.  Video mode is a waste of resourses.  Recycle time between pictures is too long.","This is my first digital camera, and I like the quality and clarity of the pictures that it takes.  I also like the storage capacity of the CD media.<br />My biggest concern is the size. It does not weigh more than your average 35 mm (probably less), but is a big device, and I have not been able to take it as many places as I could a smaller camera.  The camera also comes very barren...no carrying case, and a minimal B&W phamplet for instructions.","This is my first digital camera, and I like the quality and clarity of the pictures that it takes.

Many of the shots are amazingly good (I'm the one amazed) and the instant feedback so you can show your subject the picture is a real plus. We took the grandkids for a Christmas tree light tour the other night and when we got back, we just connected the CD1000 cable to the TV set and there were the Christmas lights for my daughter and son in law to see, with the grandkids filling in the play by play.  Grandpa and grandma got lots of points.<br />The after-market CD-Rs not only are more than 1/4 the price of Sony, but they hold 200MB vs the standard 156MB. A warning does come up, recommending Sony Mavica disks, but all work fine, including downloads into the PC.<br />The economics of CD-R photo storage is incredible. The CD-R stores about the same as 4-5 rolls of 36 exposure 35mm film, even at the highest JPEG resolution setting for the CD1000. That's about $16-$20 just for 35mm film, not counting processing or printing vs the cost of the disk which is about 80 cents.<br />The bad stuff:<br />(1)The CD1000 cannot put up with even slow motion activity shooting. Basically, when you slightly depress the shutter, a green light comes on and the image \"freezes\", ready for the final press of the shutter to store \"that\" image, right?  Not so. The green light and the frozen image simply \"charges\" the CCD array and when you press the shutter further to actually take the shot, the CCD receives whatever image is presented through the lens.  If all is still, no problem, but if the image is moving, like at a social event, you come out with part of an arm, leg, or the back of a head or two. This takes a while to adapt to and if you're planning to use the CD1000 for a sporting event camera, forget it.<br />(2)Associated with the above problem, is the image in the view finder and LCD screen goes to freeze or blank when the shutter is activated so any action is lost.  The view finder is a small LCD and not an optical look through the lens. Sure, on 35mm cams we lose the image during the shot, but only for the shutter speed.  With the CD1000, you're off for as long as the CD-R write cycle takes, about 1 to 5 seconds.<br />(3)The flash \"hot shoe\" is not.  It's only a bracket to attach Sony's own CD1000 optional flash that's non-standard via their interrconnect cord. That means all those smart flashes for our 35mm won't work.  BTW, the CD1000 built in flash is good for about 5 feet with lots of controls. However, when the flash is up, the CD1000 compensates it's exposure and darkens the shot for longer distance. Better to make 2 shots, one with flash, another without, just for safety.<br />(4)Connecting the CD1000 to USB sounds and is simple. However, in very small type on pg.32, a warning that no other device be plugged into the other USB port. So if you have an HP Scanner already plugged in to USB and want to connect the CD1000 to the other port, forget it. I've heard sometimes it works. My installation issued \"the blue screen of death\" under Windows 98 SE.  A call to Sony Tech Support, reminded me to \"read the manual\", even the fine print.  This goes against the industry standard USB spec, but Sony says the CD1000 must \"own\" the USB environment and that's the way it is.<br />Other than (1-4), the CD1000 is still a great camera. Flexible to a fault, lots of storage, great shot economics (except the price of the camera), and Sony quality. I'll stay with it, even with it's faults.","I have had the opportunity to review many of the recent digital cameras.  From the 1.3 to 3.34 megapixel.  I wasn't sure I would like this particular camera because of the 2.1 megapixel technology.  It was the CD-R that enticed me to order one.  When  I opened the box and started using it I was pleasently surprised.<br />The camera takes some very nice pictures at any resolution.  Tiff images @ 1600X1200 take a good 15+ seconds to write to the CD-R.  JPG pictures @ 1600X1200 take a little less than two seconds to write to the CD-R.  This camera is not designed to take bursting pictures or situations that require rapid succession of shots.<br />The flash works well in normal and red-eye reduction modes.  Macro shots do not do well with the flash.  The lens assembly prevents the flash from reaching a macro subject.<br />The MPEG movie mode works quite well and just like any of the other Mavica series cameras.  The limitation is a maximum recording time of 15 seconds.  If you shot is longer than this you have to take multiple 15 second shots.<br />The USB connection is really nice.  I can transfer pictures in seconds from the camera to the computer.  The supplied drivers allow the camera to become another drive letter on your computer when it is plugged in.  I am using WindowsME without any issue with this camera or software.  I little FYI note is included in the box informing the purchaser that USB drivers for Windows2000 are not included.  The note gives a URL to check for the Windows2000 driver.  As of this writing the driver is not on the web site.<br />Initializing a new CD-R is fast and easy.  It takes about 20 seconds.  The included adaptec software will also let you format the CD-R in the camera from your PC with the USB cable attached.  The included software will also let you copy files from your PC to the CD-R on the camera.  Finalizing a CD-R when it is full is easy and straightforward.  After the CD is finalized it's contents can be viewed in any computer that has a CD.  3\" CD-R's are readily available from many sources and are priced very attractively.  Buy them in bulk and you are really saving a lot of money over single CD-R purchases.<br />The image stabilization makes a noticeable differences in both the optical and zoom modes.  Battery life is excellant.  I get about 120 minutes of usage between charges.<br />All in all I really like this camera and will keep it.  However, I will really be interested in Sony's next version of a CD-R camera.  It should address some of the minor short comings of this one.","I'm digitally challenged yet I opened the box and was shooting within a careful hour's worth of reading. A few more days pratice gave me the nerve to put Sony's Big Mama into the hands of my high school students. It's frustrating to see them learn in minutes what took me an hour to learn...but.. They did! And they started discovering features I hadn't yet mastered.  I short, I love this camera! It's pricey, the delay on captured shots drives me up the wall, but it's the best thing I've seen. (I'm the envy of the ballcourt.. twice last week, professional photogs missed their shots while watching me wrangle this honey around.) Frankly, I waited on the technology until someone came up with adequate storage. Now I've got it. Sony-heads... get rid of the delay in capturing the shot and I'll trade this one in. You've got a great camera here!","The Mavica CD1000 is as good as it sounds. The 10x optical zoom is terrific (don't bother with 'digital zoom'. If you want pixelation, you'd be using a low-res camera). The 'steady shot' works well, the 'twilight-plus' flashless function is no less than magical (although you will need a tripod). And it's just plain cool!<br />The best thing about it is the cost/picture. You need the battery that comes with it, (maybe a backup -I got a 4 hour for less than ...), a protective lense filter (a uv filter costs about ...), and some mini cdr discs (comes with 5). No memory cards, smart cards or equivalent! Look around and you will be able to find the mini cd's for somewhere under .../disc (don't look and you will pay about .../disc in a case). I paid ... for 50 minis on a spindle (no cases) delivered to my door. Now, you will take somewhere between 140 and 180 high res (1200 x 1600) pictures on each disc (minus whatever you useup taking mini mpegs). So, lets be conservative. Assuming the low of 140 images/disc, and the high of ... for 50 discs, that works out to less than one penny/shot. And the images are NOT low value! I took two shots, one using the tiff sorage format  (taking 40 seconds to write a 5 Mb file to disc), and the other the std. High res jpeg. In plate by plate comparison, the jpeg was so close to the tiff as to make the extra time and disc space of the tiff format unnecessary. I have been in digital pre-press for 15 years, and these shots are equivalent to quality 4x5 scans.<br />Once you get used to the <1 second delay from first touch to shutter, you will be taking great shots, and lots of them. The delay can be eliminated in most cases by half pressing the button, allowing the auto focus to set up, then when you push, the shot is instantaneous. You'll quickly figure out where and when to turn off the auto focus and rely on distance read outs etc.<br />You will want to get a UV filter for this camera before you take it out of the box. Not to improve your pictures, but to protect your lense. Replacing the lense on an intgrated digital system like this will probably cost as much as the camera itself. The uv lense can be replaced for ... .<br />Anyway, I have used some 'high-end' Kodak DCS professional series cameras in the past, and some low end digitals as well. The Mavica CD1000 is the best all around device I have seen, and certainly the least expensive to operate.","This is my second digital camera, I am very happy with the ease of use.","I agree with the first reviewer the delay is a killer for any action shots, and you can tell that the next model will address that problem. If it is in the cards Sony should include a night vision viewer for an idea of what the photo will look like  in a low light setting. steve D, california","I take a lot of digital pictures. I am a freelance photographer shooting a lot of drama, music and dance events during stage performances.  I bought and used the earlier Sony Mavica FD-91 with the image stabelized 10x zoom. People loved the closeup and personal images I could capture with it. However, at .8 Megapixels, the FD-91 was limited to smaller prints, and the 3.5\" floppy disk had to be changed every 10 shots or so.<br />This new Sony CD1000 has same high quality zoom, plus 2.1 Megapixel capture for larger prints, external flash ability and a 156MB CD-R mini disk to store the pictures on.  I get over 160 high quality images shooting the same 3:2 aspect ratio as traditional 35mm cameras.<br />But Sony, if you want five star reviews, read on...  You will have to shorten the 1/2 second delay and viewer blackout after pressing the shutter release until the image is captured.  I have to anticipate where a subject will be, take the picture and hope.  And, if miss my shot, which happens a lot, I have to wait 3 seconds until I can try again. Sony, add some RAM memory, let us take three or four fast pictures in a row, then store them.  You are so close."]},{"name":"Kodak DC4800","amazon_reviews":["for year 2000 it still takes a great 3MP pic, more than enough for web and 4x6.

Looks a mess but it works just fine.<br />Probably won't sell the camera, as its a bit useful","I was using this camera as recently as 6 months ago, though it stopped working when it had the unfortunate luck of shifting in the backseat of my car when traveling, and falling on to the concrete when I opened the door (I've got a new Olympus C5500 now).  Anyway, before that, I had the camera for about a year (I got it from a friend who had just bought a really great camera).  While this camera is no match for my new Olympus, it was quite a good camera and a good introduction for me into semi-serious digital photography.  I had a digital camera called a \"JamCam\" before this one, but it had few options and rather low picture quality (though for the price and the time when I got it, it was actually decent).<br /><br />The Kodak DC4800 is excellent under good lighting conditions, getting photo quality prints with a good printer.  I actually got some great indoor shots with the flash too, though you can't get to close (it will wash out the picture) or to far away (it will be to dark).  The camera can be fully automatic or almost fully manual (there is no manual focus, and the automatic settings are able to make use of more F-stops then when in manual mode).<br /><br />There are three focus modes: automatic (which usually works well except when dark, as there is no af assist lamp), Macro (for taking close-up shots as close as 10\") and infinity (which allows you to lock the focus at infinity, which is good for distance shots).<br /><br />The camera includes a 3x optical zoom which is nice. When fully zoomed out, this camera gives quite a wide field of view (the only thing on this camera which is actually better then my new camera).<br /><br />Unless absolutely necessary, set the ISO setting to 100, as anything above that starts to get grainy.  At 200 grain is noticeable but usually acceptable, and iso 400 is usually very grainy.<br /><br />The camera also includes a nice neck strap, lens cap, tripod adapter, and a time delay feature to allow you to get into the picture.  The LCD display on this camera is good except when you are in bright sunlight, and then it gets hard to see, so you might need to use the optical viewfinder in some conditions.  The camera comes with a recharger.  The batter life was just okay, but I got the camera and battery used, so a new battery probably would have been much better.  The camera also has video out cables, but the friend I bought this camera from no longer had his, so I can't comment on them.  You'll also probably want to get a larger compact flash card then the one that came with the camera.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great camera in its day, and if you can find it used for a good price (be sure to compare prices as new cameras that beat this one are coming down in price all the time), it is a great starter camera which usually gets pretty good pictures (I won second place at the NJ State fair photo contest (amateur division) with a photo taken by this camera a year ago).  The camera is also quite durable, as it took many moderate bumps before the final meeting between it and concrete which finally killed it.","I've had this camera for about 3 years now.<br /><br />Picture quality:<br /><br />- takes great pictures outdoors, and indoor pictures with adequate lighting.<br /><br />- flash is not adequate.  pictures with flash are horrible.  they come out all blurry - the shutter speed isn't fast enough/CCD not good enough (when using auto settings)<br /><br />Use:<br /><br />- I like having the ability to change the f-stop setting on the fly with the knob on top of the camera.

Simple and easy to use, yet still technically advanced and customizable for the hardcore group.

The Best Digital Camera Short Of A Digital SLR.","very good camera. well, it is too sensitive to light. We could not get good indoor pictures.","This is my third Kodak digital camera and is my favorite to date. The reason I like Kodak's is I feel the menus are simple to use and the build quality / functions of the cameras are excellent.<br /> You can use the 4800 in a number of modes, as a simple point and click mode, or for the more professional photographer you can get into aperture, light, exposure etc...<br /> The resolution at 3.1 Mega Pixel is excellent and when pictures are printed out using services like ofoto or shutterfly the quality is exceptional. The camera has a 3x Optical zoom which is excellent, I choose not to rate digital zoom as attribute of a camera.<br />My only dislike with this camera is its size, there are a lot of smaller cameras out there, however I am not sure if there are many with the same kind of quality.","I owned a Kodak DC280 and loved it.  Took great shots and the flash worked great.  I gave it away and bought the DC 4800 expecting similar great photos.  The ones with plenty of light are fine, nice and crisp and print nicely. The ones in low light just aren't as good.  I think the \"auto\" selects a shutter speed of 1/8/sec which is crazy and impossible to take a good photo without a tripod.  The flash of course helps but you have to be within 8 - 10 feet.  Bottom line.  It's ok for the money, particularly if you buy one used (like I did) but if you want to print 8 x 10's you may want to keep looking.","This camera is amazing!  It had everything we were looking for, 3.1 MP, 3x zoom, and rechargable batteries.  Moreover, you can override the auto control and manually select the f-stop, ISO, shutter speed, color saturation, exposure, sharpness and exposure metering (center-weighted, etc...).  It even allows for you to take black and whites (with 3 filter options, none, red or yellow) and sepia photos.  It is certainly the most powerfull of the Kodak line, it is a shame they seem to be moving away from these features and going after the market share where people don't want all these options. That isn't to say that you can't just point and click... you can, it has auto-focus and auto exposure/speed controls... but I like the ability to override those, especially when I have backlighting or want to play with the focal depth.  Oh, and another rare feature is that it has a video output jack that you can run to a TV to view your pictures on.  This has come in handy when visiting friends or relatives and I wanted to show them pictures we had in our camera but didn't want to download them to a computer.  The menu system is amoung the more intuitive that I have seen.  All manual settings can be changed with just a couple button presses and I have yet to delete a picture by accident.  Some options, like f-stop and exposure control can be controled from dials on the camera without even going into any menu.  The battery is good, recently I took the camera out of town for a long weekend and forgot the battery charger.  We took pictures at many events over a few days and just barely got by before the battery ran out.  Of course, we have learned over time some tips on how to extend the battery life such as minimizing LCD viewing of pictures.  The 3x optical zoom is nice but I would prefer a little more.  I don't like the quality digital zoom provides, but fortunately there is a setup option to disable digital zoom so that you don't accidently use it.<br />  As close to perfect as it is, there are some minor gripes.  The manual exposure control dial seems a little flimsy like it might come off one day, fortunately it is rarely used.  Second there is a little door that you open that covers the USB and battery ports that also seems a little flimbsy.  Also, the button you use to turn on/off the camera is a bit too close to the shutter button.  If someone else is taking our picture, they invariably press the wrong button unless we make it clear which button to press.  The flash is somewhat weak (although comparible to small film cameras).  Another gotcha is that you have to press the shutter button half way down to lock in the auto focus, speed and f-stop settings before pressing the button the rest of the way down to take the picture.  Although this is standard with nearly all but the most inexpensive cameras, it is something that you have to carefully explain to anyone else who you want to take a picture or the picture will likely be out of focus.  But then again, it is digital so you can look at the picture right away and determine if it needs to be re-shot.  Finally, I think that the 16 meg card is much too small for any type of vacation use.  At the highest resolution but least compressed JPG, each photo is about 700-900 kb.  We purchased an additional 64Mb card which are quite cheap now and have yet to run out of memory (and if we did we could go out and buy another from any electronics store).<br />All in all, a great camera!!","I think one nice feature about this camera is its compatibility with an external flash. For many 35mm enthusiast, an external flash is a must-have to provide sufficient lighting from different angles. I bought a Vivitar 2000 external flash and used its PC sync cord to plug into the DC4800 terminal, it worked out nicely. Now you don't have to settle for front lighting all the time from the built-in flash, instead, you can have bounce lighting, left and right lighting, etc. Try it and you will love the result.","Purchased this camera as a gift for Christmas and it's wonderful!  It produces quality professional photos without much skill needed.  The various color and black & white modes are great for everyday use.  Has a huge array of shutter speeds to capture some great night shots.  Great camera for anyone from professional to novice!","Very fine camera for the newbie.  With the SINGLE exception of low-light photography, this camera excels in all areas.  Of note, this camera is rugged.  I've had it for 6 months and dropped it from waist height on asphalt (it also skidded across 3 lanes of traffic on it's bottom), linoleoum and an oak hardwood floor and it did not so much as discharge the battery.<br />Incredible.  Most pixel bang for the buck and the outdoor/natural light shots are breathtaking. The camera also has a multitude of professional 35mm SLR type functions for those that know what the heck they are for.","One of the problems with cameras and electronics in general is the lack of simplicity. So home runs in the electronics business (like the Imac and the Palm Pilot) try to keep it simple through thoough design and knowing what comsumers want.<br />Kodak makes this not only easy to use, but fun. Most people who buy a camera end up with features they never use and don't bother to learn. Kodak gives you the features you want, and makes software to make things accessible to the average camera user who wants wonderful pictures right away and the ability to spread them around.<br />This camera is what 90% of camera buyers are really looking for - but they end up with something else too often","I've had mine for about 7 months now and really like it.  I can't add much to the other reviews here, other than a question:  why is there so little coverage of this camera around?  It really seems to be the forgotten stepchild.  of","I bought one in March and liked it ever since.  It's small, light and easy to use.  It gives you many controls over the settings. I'm no photography expert at all, so I never used those fully manual settings.  But it's comforting to know that they're there.  You have more options to save pictures, from uncompressed TIFF to 0.8MP, 2.1MP and 3.1MP JPG(high compression, medium compression and etc).  This makes me feel better than those ambiguous \"good, fine, best\" grades used in other digital cameras.  I did have some grainy pictures but after I set white balance to auto, everything is fine.  I used it on a 10 day trip along with two 128M CF cards and a quick charger.  It worked perfectly well.  Well, I wish I could have more CF cards.  Fortunately my friends brought a laptop with him.  The pictures were sharper and clearer than those taken by a Fuji 6800.  This camera works especially well outdoor under strong light.  The battery life is good too.  It can handle about 100 pictures with flash on.<br />Here're my recommendations:<br />1. buy a lens cap cord<br />2. buy a quick charger set which also includes a battery.  The quick charger is very convenient and it takes less than an hour to fully charge a drained battery.<br />3. buy at least 256 MB CF cards if you're out for a trip.  It will allow you to take about 260 pictures (equivalent to 10 rolls of film) using 3.1MP low compression mode.","Super nice product! Though 3.1 MP seems too much for viewing picture on monitor, its performance is absolutely among the best. I like its long time exposure functionality to take natural picture in dark surroundings.<br />This is all what you need for a nice digital camera.<br />weekness: flash is not powerful and batteries don't last long enough when LCD is on.","I bought this camera in March prior to a trip to Germany.  I didn't get a chance to use it too much prior to the trip so I took most of my pictures with my film camera. I used the camera a lot during the summer and got very comfortable with it.  When I  went to Rome last month I used the Kodak for most of my pictures.  I was very impressed with the quality of the pictures, the number of hight quality pictures I could get on a smart card in the compressed mode and most of all its versatility, especially taking indoor pictures inside the large churches.  A flash would be useless in those circumstances.  I got really nice pictures using just the available light.  Even got interior pictures of the Sistine Chapel without flash before the guard stopped me.<br />I am very pleased with the camera and recommend it to anyone who is looking for more than a point and shoot camera.","I received my Kodak DC 4800 and immediately found out that it was a discontinued product, which disconcerted me.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the camera.  It has a picture clarity of cameras of higher price tags.  It takes crisp pictures inside and outside as well.  The detail is explosive.  I like to \"tinker\" and I don't want my camera to tell me what to do (at times).  This camera is fully adjustable (as were cameras in the past).  The new line of Kodak is fully automatic -- in other words, you loose control over picture taking.  I think it gives me better pictures than a conventional camera -- with instant access to my picture work which is the joy of the digital age.<br />I initially received a defective camera.  Kodak attempted to fix it once.  I sent the camera in via insured mail and the camera was promptly returned with a note saying all was A OKAY.  But it wasn't.  The camera wouldn't turn on.  The screen would not show an image (etc).  I called Kodak and the sent me out another jewel.  I have no problems with either camera nor Kodak.  They were responsive and responsible.<br />I highly recomend this camera even in its used form.  It may very well be the last of its kind: a fully adjustable high resolution digital camera.","I love to take photos and had put off buying a digital camera because most of the images I had seen were less than desirable. I refused to buy a digital camera that did not take pictures as well as my traditional camera. This camera by Kodak was the one for me! Not only is it easy to use, but it also has many features that you won't find on other cameras. It has several color and flash modes to allow you to be a photography wiz. The images are crisp and perfect; no color differentiations whatsoever. This is simply the best digital camera I have seen.","I've been using digital cameras for more than 5 years now, since 640 x 480 was state of the art. This is my third, and I really love it when it performs well. Picture quality is absolutely outstanding. I would trade the great images for the lack of recording sound or video any day.<br />It's great for outdoor shots of both landscapes and people. Indoors is more problematic. In low light conditions, especially with a nearby artificial light source, pictures are hit or miss. Some come out OK; others are blurry. And unfortunately, they look fine on the little LCD so I think the photos are OK; it's only when I see them on screen that I discover they're out of focus. I've tried fiddling with the manual settings for this with little success.<br />For a travel/vacation camera, it's superb. If all you're doing is taking quick indoor shots of family and friends, you might want to think about another camera.","I purchased an Olympus camera for my parents that was only a 2.4 mgpix and then did some research and thought that the DC4800 would be better.  I have used both and the Olympus by far has taken better pictures for half the price and almost have the pixels.  My DC4800 takes better indoor pictures without the flash even though the camera tells me to use flash.  Indoor quality is lacking compared to outdoor.  The Olympus also captures action shots better than the DC4800 as well.  Everyone has rated this camera well.  Maybe there is something wrong with mine?","I previously owned a Kodak 215 and 290, and really liked both<br />of them, but the 4800 is fantastic. Kodak, when will you be<br />ready with a 4 megapixel / 10 power optical zoom? I'll<br />probably buy it. Keep up the outstanding quality.","For the general digital camera user, the Kodak DC4800 camera is one of the best buys around.  It's one of the cheapest 3+ megapixel cameras you will find, yet it's loaded with features and its incredibly easy to use.<br />Also, unlike many other cameras which make you buy several key components separately, the DC4800 comes complete with everything you need to take great pictures right out of the box, including Lithium rechargable battery, AC adapter, 16MB memory card, and all cables.  The only things you may need to buy later are a carrying case and possibly more memory for longer outings.  The Lithium battery is key - I've been thouroughly frustrated with other digital cameras that use AA batteries which they use up after 5 or 6 pictures.<br />I've also found the instruction manual to be extremely well written and indexed - the best instructions out of four digital cameras I've used - and the camera itself has proven very durable - I must admit I've dropped it several times, but it still works as good as new.<br />The best thing of all about the DC4800 though, is the outstanding picture quality.  Compared to pictures I took at the same resolution with other cameras, the DC4800 pictures are always a little sharper and a little more vivid.  The colors this camera produces are really outstanding.  Even the lowest resolution is pretty darn good.<br />I would take this camera over several cameras that are almost twice the cost - I am thoroughly satisfied with this camera.","I purchased this camera in July and it has been a wonderful \"out-of-the-box\" experience. The menu's are easy to understand and within a short period of time I was up and running. I have only used the camera in high definition mode and the results are incredible. Made a 12\"x18\" print, without any digital enhancements, that rivals the quality of a conventional enlargement from 35mm color film. There are several other features that ranked high on my list. The selection of apertures is important for selective focus and this camera gives me that control. The external flash connector works well with my portable (and more powerful)flash units. In short, a well-built camera at an affordable price.","After a year long review of the various digital cameras (under $600/) I finally purchased a DC-4800 camera and boy what a pleasent surprise. This camera is great with sharp, clear 8 X 11 photographs and beautiful resolution. My previous digital cameras Epson 500 and then a 600 were nice, but this Kodak is loaded with the latest technoligy and very easy to use. I especially like the zoom and color saturation (bright) or natural color capability. I highly recommend this camera for ease of use and the beautiful pictures. The camera comes complete with all the goodies needed, however I did purchase a [price] ScanDisk reader for easier and quicker downloads.","I just love this camera. It is my first digital camera so I can't compare it to others but it sure meets my needs. I would give it 5 stars except it came with a picture card with only 16MB. I could have gone on for some time with 16MB but I did actually purchase another picture disk for more memory. I did not need the expensive Kodak disk. The cheaper brand works fine. It works easily on my computer and the pictures are good quality. I'd buy it again if I had the chance.","For the price and features of this camera, it is an excellent buy and hard to beat. I have been a 35mm SLR user for over 40 years and I find the quality coming from this camera to be excellent.  I can manipulate  the lens or go automatic.  I have been using it for about 6 months and I am amazed at the quality especially in low light areas.  I still need to get the attachment lens and try those out but this is adequate for 90% of my work. The only complaint I have is the delay from snapping the shot to the recording of the shot where a young child (and adults too)can quickly turn their head.","P>I didn't find the camera very intuitive to use, which problem was worsened by the fact that I don't use a camera very often, so I tend to forget the solutions that worked last time. (Why should a camera be so complex that you need to reconstruct its systems after a lapse of a few weeks?) In particular, I found myself too often taking medium-distance shots with the close-up setting, and getting washed-out images in bright sunlight. Yet I once made my living as a photographer! I couldn't recommend this to the soccer mom or dad who only wants an occasional snapshot.<br />That said, I'm glad I own it. I've gone almost entirely digital in my life, and if it weren't for the digital camera I probably wouldn't take pictures at all. The picture quality is good, and you have some (not a huge amount) of selectivity in how your photo will be framed and exposed. (You can select the lens opening, for example.)<br />I recently changed computers, and I had no problem installing the software on a Windows Me box without a patch from Kodak.","Further to my review dated July 5, Kodak has confirmed to me that as originally shipped, the DC4800 camera was not fully compatible with Windows Me.  An upgraded software download is available on the the Kodak Website.  It is about 7 MB and so takes a while to download.  You need to delete any preexisting DC4800 software on your computer and then install the download.  I did, and the camera now runs fine on my PIII/800 Windows Me 'puter.  No more distorted thumbnails.  It runs so-so on my other PIII/450 Windows 98 machine.  Thumbnails load slowly.<br />I earlier installed the firmware upgrade and have had no problems with low-light focusing or exposure.  The camera does well in remarkably little light.<br />The zoom control has not worked on three or four occasions.  One moves the switch and nothing happens.  I am not sure yet whether it's a camera defect or I whether I may have had something set wrong.  I hope the latter.<br />Generally speaking, the camera is a nice handling, nice feeling little piece of machinery. I just wish Kodak had taken a little more care with the software rather than leaving it to customers to put Humpty Dumpty together post-purchase.  Oh well, at least Kodak was responsive -- after I told them that if I hadn't heard back by a certain date, I would publicize their non-response here.","After much research, I bought this camera to replace a more limited HP digital camera.  It has proven to be an outstanding camera with excellent resolution and ease of use.  From the gripes I've read, I don't think people read the manual nor understand the basics of SLR photography.  The flexibility and override features of this camera provide excellent results. I bought a 128 mb compactflash disk for $70; Also, recommend getting an additional battery and wall-charger; I also bought a rechargeable external battery pack that lasts FOREVER!  For those experienced with manually adjusting an SLR camera, this is the best camera for digital!","I have had the camera for about 6 weeks now.  It arrived very timely.  Light weight, easy to use.  Perfect for a novice.<br />However, Kodak's rebate system is very, very poor.  I received almost immediate acknowledgement from thier rebate center that they had all the necessary documents.  Now after 6 weeks and a phone call to the rebate center, I'm told it will be ANOTHER 30 days before I get my $... rebate.<br />DON't do as I did and put too much emphasis on the rebate when making your buying decision.","Wow, my first dive into digital photograhpy has been a success.  At the 3 megapixal setting w/ jpeg compression, you're able to get 64 pictures on a 64MB compact flash, and the resolution and color are 35mm processing quality.  4x6 up to 8x10 print on my HP Deskjet 950c at photo processing quality.  The camera is easy to use for the point and shoot type (like me), but has lots of manual capability for the more expert photographer.<br />The Kodak software provided is also excellent - easy way to save, print, and view photos.<br />A great package for the price.  The best value for a 3 megapixel camera I could find at [price]after rebate.","I'm no rocket scientist so I was looking for an easy to use digital camera that produced good results. Many sources I read pointed to this camera. It also has all the accessories necessary to make it work; things like the USB connection, a power charger, battery included, and a media card. I read a few reviews at Amazon where the customer had trouble setting up so I was prepared for possible problems. So I get the camera, charge it up, install the PC software, and the thing works like a champ. No problems. The book is easy to read, the camera is easy to use, and I found the software simple and intuitive. I am very pleased with my purchase. My challenge now is to find a great photo printer. I have also kept the camera at the default settings and bought a bigger media card - the 64mb media card gives me about 64 3.1mb photos. What's the point of getting a 3x mb camera if you are going to dumb it down? I am very pleased so far.","Largely prompted by the positive reviews here I just acquired the DC4800, my first digital cam.  I second the positive comments and won't be repetitive.  But there are some minor negatives.<br />1)  No lens cap cord so the cap won't get lost.  That is a chintzy omission by Kodak.  The cap is small and would soon be gone.  I jury-rigged a rubber band as a temporary attachment until I can devise something prettier.<br />2)  I purchased the DC4800EZ kit which includes an extra battery and a 64MB card.  But it's still incomplete.  The kit should also include the outboard battery charger, and a camera case.  Shortsighted marketing by Kodak.<br />3)  The camera literature speaks of Windows 98 and 2000 but not Windows Me.  I have Windows Me.  There may be a minor software conflict.  When opening .JPG files from Windows Explorer, with the DC4800 camera software installed the thumbnails that come up are badly distorted.  You can open the photos themselves and work on them full-size OK, attach them to emails OK, etc., but the thumbnails are unviewable.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the DC4800 software several times.  With the DC4800 software absent the thumbnails are fine.  With it present they are unusable.  It appears there is some glitch between the DC4800 software and Windows Me.  I have emailed Kodak to that effect and am awaiting a response.","I cannot understand why this camera is so highly rated.  As an experienced photographer, I find the quality of components rather cheap, like for instance the plastic lens holder. I was also irritated that after spending over ... on the camera and all accessories, Kodak would not honor the ... rebate because of an adminstrative error.","I would like to start out by saying this is my first experience with digital photography. For the last 30 years, I have used a 35MM Nikon F with the FTN meter. After doing research to determine which camera I thought would fit my needs, I purchased the Kodak DC4800. Before going on my vacation, I also purchased a 128 MB flash card and the extra battery and charger. While on vacation I took 101 pictures with about a third to one half with using the flash. I then came home and downloaded the pictures into my PC 3 or four times before saving them to my hard drive. During this time, I never changed or recharged the battery and had no problems at all. As of yet I have not tried the external flash. I strictly wanted to find out what the camera by itself would do. At this point, I am very impressed with the ease of how the camera works and the ability to control all of the many settings and not have to be a programming wizard to do it. With just a little effort and playing with the buttons, you can just about figure everything out without even using the manual. This camera is very user friendly. I would also like to mention even with being very light it seems to be well constructed. This camera is easy to hold and the buttons for the different controls all seem to be just where you would want them. I did have a little problem with the focusing, but after realizing the camera needed to be set on the distance setting for almost all shots and downloading the new software off the Kodak web site this problem has been taken care of. Letting the camera program everything gives me very good results and takes all the work out of picture taking. This leaves me with just the fun aspects, frame point and shoot... It is nice that if I get into special situations though I can still take control of all the settings if I think it becomes necessary. Bottom line is it easy to use, gets great pictures, and I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.<br />I would like to add this information that might help in purchasing this camera. At the default setting of 3.1 MP the resolution is 2160 X 1440. This is an approx. file size of 960 KB. That means you are going to get just a little over one picture per MB. So a 65MB card = 65 pictures or 128MB card = 128 pictures. I recieved a 16MB card with my camera and sixteen pictures just doesn`t get the job done. I purchased a 128MB and think this was a wise investment for me. When ordering a camera just figure about how many pictures you want to be able to take without changing cards or downloading and that will tell you what size card you need to purchase to accommodate your needs.<br />One more thing I would like to add is that when you take a picture it is not like useing a regular camera. You push the button to take the picture half way down to set the focus and exsposure, the press it all the way down to take a picture. If you press the shutter all the way down in one complete movment your pictures will be out of focus and the exsposure will also be wrong. This is one of the few things I had to read the manual on to find out how to do correctly. Somehow I think that a lot of the problems people have (if not all) could be eliminated by spending some time learning how to use the camera correctly. It is different from a 35MM or a plain point and shoot camera. Like I mentioned in the title , this is my first digital camera after using a 35MM for 30 years and I think it works great.... YES I DID TAKE TIME TO EXSPERIMENT WITH IT before comming to my conclusion. If I had made a quick judgement before learning how the camera works I would not have rated very high.<br />Again I would like to say that I am very pleased with this camera. GO BUY ONE!!!!","I have owned this camera for 4 months.<br />First off let me start by saying there is definitely a manufacturing glitch somewhere, as there have been numerous accounts of the cases of this camera developing cracks.  I for one have one with cracks.  It typically appears around the LCD, and zoom lever.  Kodak is repairing this under warranty, but who needs a new camera that develops cracks??  If you are interested in reading more about this, please see this forum: [...] specifically this thread: [...]  I just think potential buyers should be aware of this problem.<br />Now on to the picture taking ability.  I had a DC290 before, and this one comes no where near the quality of the Kodak DC290.  I did the firmware upgrade, it DID NOT help my indoor shots, which usually turn out terrible.  In low light, this camera doesn't do it's job effectively.  I can tell you that outdoors the picture quality is great, but who uses a camera outdoors 100% of the time?  I know I don't.  But for the price, it was an okay deal for me.  With the rebate I ended up paying 375.00, which is pretty good.","I received this camera complete with all accessories as a high school graduation present. I had already owned another digital camera for about two years and had outgrown it, as my photography skills improved by about ten-fold. This is definately a great camera for me and for anyone who is ready to take a more professional step with their pictures, and who wants to get a great, high resolution result.<br />I've been reading some of the negative reviews and I have to say that the gripes that people have can be solved through a bit of personal involvement, or cannot be solved, because almost every other camera out there is the same!<br />I'm glad Kodak uses lithium batteries, because my other camera drained four (name brand) alkaline batteries in 10 minutes. It's no different with any other camera. My dad works with lots of video equipment, and he said that there are no digital cameras out there that won't significantly drain batteries within a few short moments.<br />As to software flaws I've read about, being unable to delete photos and send email are hardly huge issues that deserve giving this camera 1 or 2 stars. AOL, Outlook, or any email program gives simple instructions on how to attach photos to your emails in mere seconds, and deleting files is something easily learned and done through the use of a basic Windows or Macintosh file manager. These are basic computer user skills; if you can't do this, then should you be using a digital camera?<br />My only disappointment with this camera regards a personal issue. I'm scared to take this camera outside my home, for fear of getting mugged for it. :) It's beautifully constructed, easy to use, not that heavy for a digital camera, and quietly functions. I am shocked how well my pictures come out in natural light without using the flash.<br />This camera was one of the best presents I've ever received, and I think everyone who wants a high - end digital camera should purchase this one :)","As a first time owner and user of any digital camera, I chose this camera because of the many features, as well as the price w/ rebate.  I have to say, this camera is EXTREMELY easy to use and operate.  I have never touched a digital camera before, & I found this one to be very simplistic in operation.  It takes great pics, and although the memory card included is a bit small, this is a fantastic deal!  I also like the looks (more like an SLR), as well as it is lightweight.  No problems what so ever.  Other than upgrading the memory card, you may want to purchase an additional battery for backup.  Otherwise, you CAN'T go wrong w/ this camera!!  The software included is very easy to use and understand.  I found no problem figuring out how to modify / enhance digitally stored pictures.  (I started out w/ no clue)--I fiddled w/ it a bit, and next thing you know, I had it all figured out!  Don't hesitate to purchase this camera.  For the price, the 3.1 mega pixels, and the numerous features, you are definitely getting a bang for your buck!!","Has many features that you can manually adjust or go completely automatic. You can burst shoot, shoot in two modes of color, b&w or sepia tones. Nice 3x optical zoom lense as well as less desirable 2x digital zoom. It is light weight, easy to handle and even has a closeup feature in the LCD of the picture you just took. It even has six choices of quality (compression settings).All in all I highly recommend this camera to all.","I'm a small-time enthusiast, and this camera has a great many things going for people in my category (people who aren't pros or experts, but care enough about photography to grimace at the quality of most point-and-shoot cameras; people who want a camera that can take a carefully designed photograph, as well as an on-the-fly fun shot).<br />I won't get into all the details-- there's a great write-up of this camera at<br />[...] ,<br />but basically, the gist is that there are more options than you could shake a big stick at (perfect when you want to setup a nice photograph), which are all very easy to access (so you won't spend an hour doing it), that also works very well in automatic mode (when you want to take that on-the-fly shot), but also lets you combine any degree of automatic and manual functionality.<br />Two great things I want to specifically mention about the camera, though, are its terrific options for color adjustment, as well as the ability to combine and adjust the automatic functionality.<br />The options for adjusting color are amazing-- again, I won't go into all the different options (I'd be writing for about an hour if I did-- the article above describes the options very well), but the options are numerous, and are genuinely useful (i.e. produces real differences in the final shot-- they're not gimmicks).  For instance, saturated color does amazing things to green-- great for outdoors shots!<br />But the really great thing about the camera is the ability to combine automatic and manual functionality.  Instead of forcing you to choose between fully automatic and fully manual mode, instead you can choose any number of settings manually, and let the camera do the rest.  Often times I will set the f-stop, or the color scheme, or the film speed, or the sharpness, or the white balance, or any combination of those, and let the camera do the rest.  This is absolutely WONDERFUL for people (like me) who often wish to add some specific element to a photo without having to take full control of all settings.  The only exception to this is shutter speed selection-- if you choose a shutter speed, you must also choose the f-stop.  Nonetheless, Kodak's implementation of automatic and manual functionality is really slick.<br />You won't find this many options on any other 3.1MP camera that prices for <= $600.<br />Warning to potential buyers: buy a case, it doesn't come with one.","I just upgraded to the DC4800 from the Kodak DC280 2.1 MP camera, which is a great camera itself. Here are some quick reasons why this camera fulfills every digital camera need of mine:<br />1. Rechargeable Li-On battery. No more messing with batteries. I simply plug the camera in and I have a freshly charged battery. It lasts a LONG time. If you need more battery time, you can get an extra battery to plug in.<br />2. 3.1 Megapixel pictures rival film. Great, clear, pictures.<br />3. Easy to use, yet very powerful. This camera can point and shoot, or you can control every settting via a menu, dial, or switch. It couldn't be easier to use, but it's nice to know that you can tweak settings such as ISO, F stop, etc.<br />4. 3X optical zoom. Most cameras are 2X. I don't use digital zoom, but it's here too.<br />5. Uses inexpensive and reliable compactflash media<br />I could go on and on. This is a great camera.<br />Buy it! You won't be sorry.","This is an example of Kodak's best effort to bring film camera buyers into the digital photo world. The 4800 looks and feels like a 35mm film camera, and offers dedicated user controls that will make transitioning users comfortable with digital cameras. The 4800 has spectacular resolution (true 3 megabyte) for perfect 8\" x 10\" printing, coupled with a very good optical 3x zoom. The CompactFlash memory cards are the best buy available today, with sizes that would allow for many hundreds of shots per card. When this camera is coupled with an inexpensive card reader (easier to use, but not absolutely necessary in light of the supplied USB cable on the 4800) and the user subscribes to any of the online photo printing services, the true beauty of digital photography is clear.","Having just retired from the Associated Press as a photographer and using the Canon and Nikon Digital cameras in my work, up to $15,000 each, I bought a DC4800 and love it. What a great camera and would transmit an image from it on the AP Photo wire if the situation and photo op came up.","I've owned a lot of cameras (and still do), but this one is by far my favorite.  The quality of the photos is excellent and it's easy to use.  I am on the leading edge of the Baby Boom and consequently need glasses for close-up, but this camera and the digital menus are easy enough to read without my glasses.  I don't think you can go wrong if you purchase this camera.","I really love this camera. Its small compact and takes some really great shots...Outdoors indoors even with a flash it just doesnt get it right. I upgraded the firmware for the cam which improved the focusing slightly but not enough.","I searched and searched and searched for what-I-hoped-to-be-the \"perfect\" camera.  It had to be flexible, allowing for simple point-and-shoot AND manual photography.  I wanted to be able to use zoom, telephoto, and wide-angle lens.  I wanted a LOT of pixels.  I wanted it to be able to grow with my expertise.  Finally, it had to be affordable.<br />It's not often you hit the ball out of the park in your first at-bat.  The DC4800 is a great camera!  I didn't buy it here (mine came with an extra battery and a 64MB CompactFlash card instead of 16MB), but I had to tell SOMEBODY!  ;-)  I was tossed between the Sony Mavica that writes to mini-CDs and this camera.  The Mavica sells for $1300, and is only a 2.1 megapixel.  The money I saved on the DC4800 went toward two extra batteries (4 total), a battery charger, an extra 64MB Compact Flash, an external USB card reader, and a trip to Boston for summer vacation!","I am very pleased with my new DC4800!  Kodak has put in a lot of quality options that will please both the novice and expert photographer!  It is easy to use, lightweight, and fun to take pictures with.  Compared to other brands in this class, Kodak seems to have better quality pictures than any other camera I have used or seen.  My only disappointment is that the camera didn't come with a carrying case.","I have shot 35mm for decades.  A few years ago I got tired of lugging my SLR outfit around and started using good quality P&S autofocus cameras which did a generally good job but fell short in flexibility and indoor flash capabilities.  I tried out a Kodak DC 215 last Fall to see if digital was for me. I really liked the advantages of digital, but realized I needed a 3-megapixel camera to get the quality I wanted.  The DC 215 also offered no more flexibility than my P&S cameras.  I narrowed my choices to the Kodak DC 4800, the Olympus C-3000 and the Nikon Coolpix 880.  I finally bought the Kodak due to the current pricing.  I feel this is the best bargain in a 3-megapixel camera right now.<br />The DC 4800 actually provides all the needed traditional film camera flexibility I want in a much more manageable outfit than my old SLR.  When you register the camera on the ..., they will send you a ... lens adapter free.  I plan to get the telephoto lens and with the built in zoom lens I will have nearly all the focal lengths I had with my SLR's three lenses and  2X tele-extender -  all in a form factor that fits in a fanny pack.<br />I downloaded the firmware version 1.04 and have had no trouble with low light focusing.  I have had excellent results with picture quality and my results continue to improve as I learn to use all of the camera's features.<br />There has been some criticism of the flash.  The DC 4800's flash capabilities are at least as good as my P&S cameras, which I realize is ... with faint praise, but this camera's features allow you to easily overcome this limitation.  Here's what you do: Buy an inexpensive tilt head automatic flash ( I got the Vivitar 2000, under ... at the country's largest retailer), and then purchase a flash shoe bracket that attaches to the tripod mount on the camera.  This costs ... for a straight bar or about ... for an L bracket.  If your local camera store doesn't have these, they are available on-line.  Plug the flash into the camera's flash terminal.  The extremely handy f-stop selection dial can be set to 5.6 for straight flash or 2.8 for bounce flash (I have always had better results with bounce).  One caveat: As the lens zooms in, the f-stop setting will close down somewhat - I find you can zoom 1x to 1.3 x before this happens.  Usually indoors this is not a problem as you can move closer to your subject instead of increasing the zoom.  Bottom line is I get the same flash quality and convenience as on my SLR for only a ... investment - try this on most consumer digital cameras!","One picture speaks 1,000 words! Take look at some pictures I took using Kodak DC4800: [...]<br />(album \"Kodak DC4800 test\")","This is my first, and possibly last, digital camera. I won't need another.  This thing is AWESOME!  But do the camera justice and yourself a favor, get a photo quality printer.","PROS: Vivid colors, astonishing picture quality and details, great design and ergonomics, USB connection<br />CONS: Battery drains fast, bad focus in low-light conditions<br />Kodak's DC4800 gives you easy access to manual functions, offers a direct USB connection to download photos to desktop and notebook, more sturdy than other cheap cameras, accurate colors that rivals film cameras. Having access to higher resolutions (such as 3.1 mega pixels) is is important as well, b/c you want your picture to be sharp and crisp.<br />Ergonomics are great and your hands will feel at home when using it!  The casing feels very solid, but the two plastic doors (for connectivity and the memory card) looks like they could break at any time.<br />Here are the functions accessible manually:  - Self-timer: to chose the moment your camera will triggers itself.  - Burst mode: to take 4 pictures in sequence (at the lowest picture quality, you can take up to 16).  - Landscape: to prevent the camera from focusing on a near subject and have the horizon in focus.  - Close-up: To let the camera adjust the focus to take a subject between 0.7-2.3 feet in great details.  - Flash and flash settings: Will let you chose between flash, no flash, red-eye  - Exposure compensation (from -2 to +2): This will let you chose to over- or underexpose your subject, to adapt to various light conditions.  - Aperture (f/8, f/5.6, f/2.8): You can decide on the depth of field, so that you can have sharpness and blurriness where you like it on your photos. You can also choose P for the automatic settings to take over.  - Zoom in/out: You get a 3x physical zoom, and also a 2x digital (which adds up to the 3x automatically when you press the zoom button long enough). You could also choose to block your camera from entering the digital zoom mode, to prevent yourself from using it (I have yet to see a photo which benefited the use of the digital zoom... they're always grainy, not only with the Kodak's digital zoom, but with all those I tried).<br />The Kodak DC4800 comes with a 16 mb Compact Flash memory card, which is a complete nonsense for a 3.1 mega pixels camera. You should buy at least 64 MB. Amazon has great prices on this.<br />The BAD part of the DC4800 is its inability to focus in low-light conditions. It rarely focuses on the subject but looks for any source of light and focus at that point.<br />The main complaint with the DC4800 goes to the battery.Kodak's proprietary Li-Ion battery that's used in the DC4800 doesn't impress at all. With the LCD on, it doesn't last more than 40 pictures, after which the LCD turns itself off. Get a charger and solve your problems.<br />ALL digital cameras have their shortfalls, but this one has the least. It's simply amazing when you consider the price!","I love my DC4800. I consider myself to be an above average amateur photographer, and this is my first digital camera purchase. I like the flexibility for things like adjusting exposure and meter weighting. Photos I have taken with it have already been printed professionally in a theter pogram and came out really really well. The DC4800 takes fabulous pictures and was a great value as compared to the other 3 MP camras out there. In particular, it takes better low-light photos than the other 3 MP camera I have used (Nikon Coolpix 950) My two minor complaints:<br />1) Power button is VERY close to the shutter release. If you hand a stranger this camera to take your picture, you have to explain it to them, because half the time they will turn off the camera instead of taking your picture.<br />2) The software is a bit difficult to get started with. Like another reviewer said, be sure and download the firmware upgrade to improve the low-light focusing. Also, I could not get the camera to connect to my PC with the included software. Once I downloaded the latest version, it worked like a charm. I blame it on Windows more than Kodk, but still...","After shopping around, I found the Kodak DC 4800 to be the best price versus performance deal on a mid level digital camera.  The hi quality picture (3.1 MP), USB transfer, manual vs automatic settings and powerful lithium ion battery are usually found on much more expensive cameras.<br />Obviously for any camera buff image quality is paramount.  The DC 4800's high resolution pictures will blow up to 8x10 easily, and even up to 11x14 with a good quality shot.  There are a large number of controls that allow the user to adjust for a particular look (saturated color, neutral color, b&w, filtered) or for unique lighting.  We found that the image quality on this camera was excellent compared to the other digital cameras that we tried out.  Some of our shots showed some aliasing (jagged lines) in compressed modes.  However, it disappeared once the images were shot in uncompressed mode (and without digital zoom).  As noted by other reviewers, getting the firmware upgrade from the kodak website is important for the quality of low light shots.<br />Another important feature is ease of use.  The camera software is easy to install, the manual is well written and the placement of most common shot settings on a dial on top of the camera is very helpful.  I wanted simple point and shoot, which this camera easily supports.  On the other hand, my girlfriend is a commercial artist and wanted to be able to operate with manual settings on a traditional camera.  Both of us are very happy using the camera.<br />The only negatives are lack of twain compliance, the small memory card and the long battery charging time:<br />- TWAIN is an industry standard interface that will allow you to connect your camera directly to numerous photo imaging software packages.  This is not supported by the DC 4800 so most file transfers are a two step process. - A 16 MB compact card will only hold 10-15 images with standard compression.  ... The battery charger takes four hours.  A faster charger is available with a second battery but again it costs a little much<br />Overall, this was a great deal (note it pays to shop around as the price on the camera varies greatly) for a camera that will grow with your experience.  From day one, you will get great quality shots and as you become more confident, you can manually adjust many functions to produce your own look.","First of all, all the great reviews here and on other sites for this camera are well-deserved.  I will not waste more time repeating what others have said, except to say that the flash works as well or better than any point and shoot 35mm I have used before.  However, the flash does tend to wash out color, which you can compensate for by manually adjusting the white balance, which is excellent on this camera, or by not using a flash and taking a longer exposure.  I recommend the latter, and was very surprised at how sensitive the camera was in fairly low light.  Certainly far more sensitive than my P.O.S. film camera.  Battery life is a big issue for all dig cams, and I would say that if you do nothing to save battery life, you get about 2-3 hours of continuous use from one charge.  If you turn off the LCD and don¡¯t use the flash, you will extend this a great deal.  I am not sure how much more life this gives you, as the battery never ran out when I did this, but it is at least four hours.  Your expectations for the battery should be similar to a laptop or a camcorder, and this battery works as well or better than most.  As for complaints about the lens cap not attaching to the camera body, you don¡¯t have to be MacGuyver to figure out that a piece of string about 8 inches long should solve this problem. Pros:  easy use right out of the box (after 4 hours to charge the battery), excellent manual, super images, fast download to PC, image control (white balance, exposure, aperture, color saturation, uncompressed TIFF option for really high res).  Able to accommodate additional lenses with the adapter that you get free for registering the camera.  Price is a plus, esp. now with the $100 rebate.  Shop around and you can find this camera for... after rebate. Cons:  memory card is comically, if not criminally, insufficient.  At max resolution, one picture will be 9MB.  The included card is 16MB.  To state the obvious, this would give you ONE pic at max res.  Using minimal compression, files are ~2MB.  What is the point of having 3MP power if you can¡¯t use it?  You need a bigger memory card, the EZ upgrade comes with a 64MB card and an extra battery for less than the price of the card alone.  NB, the battery charger is not included in this package.  The included software is not very good, to be kind.  It is functional if you have no alternative, but I would say that Photoeditor is far superior and Photodeluxe or photoshop are too superior to even compare.  Also, the camera software is not compatible with windows NT.  You can buy a card reader for pretty cheap to overcome this, which you might want to buy anyway to avoid always connecting/disconnecting the camera from the PC. Overall:  Buy this camera with the extra battery, charger, and larger memory and you will probably have no complaints.","I received this camera friday afternoon, and by sunday night I had taken 200 pictures.  Let me tell you, this camera is AWESOME.  One word of caution though, GET THE FIRMWARE UPDATE FROM KODAK.COM as SOON as you get the camera.  The update fixes an autofocus issue that can leave some lower light and indoor pictures grainier in appearance than they should. Also, buy the battery and charger.  The charger will fully charge a battery in about an hour, while the the camera/AC adapter takes over four.  It is very nice to have that extra battery too.  Also, splurge and get a bigger cf card too, 16MB just doesn't cut it anymore. I admit, I am a camera novice.  Still, this camera will deliver the goods in full automatic mode.  The LCD is well readable in direct sunlight and the ON-TO-SHOOT time is the best I've seen.  This is a truely great little (and light) digital camera.","The pictures are not as clear as the ones from a medium-format Hassleblad, nor is the color as brilliant as the one from professional photo albums.  Yet, in picture quality, this Kodak 4800 beats all the other digicams I've used under $1,000. The $5,000 Nikon D1 may have better color saturation, but I have to wait until I save that amount of money.<br />In addition to picture quality, the price is excellent and the camera's portability may attract many more users. A fully charged battery lasts about 35 pictures (with the LCD panel turned to Power Save Off).  I suggest taking pictures with the LCD panel completely turned off.  According to PC World, one can take 171 pictures this way.<br />In spite of all its pros, the battery system is designed for use near home and in North America only.  If you travel abroad, good luck finding a UL-certified step-down transformer with proper plugs and sockets.  Also, if you want to take the camera out on a moment's notice, you have to wait four hours until the battery is fully charged.  In summary, the battery system for Kodak 3400 that uses 4 AA batteries is a more sensible one, though that may add a little weight to the machine.","After reading the reviews for all 3.1 Megapixels cameras for a few weeks, I bought Kodak DC4800.  I need a camera for panoramic picture and there aren't too many wide-angle digital camera.  I also need a camera to take close-up pictures in low light.  I have to say that DC4800 exceeds all my expectations.  The pictures taken outdoor or indoor are gorgeus.  The macro shots are GREAT.  I would definitely recommend buying this camera. While I had some problems with USB download with a Mac computer (but not with a Windown machine), Kodak is actually sending me a flashcard reader for FREE!  What a great company and I am extremely pleased with the camera and its technical support.","I've looked at quite a few digital cameras both online and in stores, but I never found one that even comes close to the \"manual\" feel of this camera.  If you know how to take pictures, you'll really appreciate the way this camera enables you to control aspects like shutter speed that most digital cameras insist on controlling themselves.<br />I took pictures in total darkness (with the flash of course) and they came out perfectly.  I took low-light shots with a longer shutter setting (no flash) and those came out well too.  I took action shots, still shots, light-saturated, low-light, indoor, outdoor, with people, with distant scenery, and more...  All came out as well as could be expected from any analog camera.<br />The USB connection is fairly straight-forward though it could use a better user interface.  The battery does get drained pretty quickly, so you can't just leave the camera on as you walk around on a tour.  But it's only flaws (besides a cheap lens cap) can be fixed with an extra battery and larger compact flash.  All around though, I haven't seen a digital camera yet that can even compete.","I love this camera.  It takes clear, crisp images.  It offers quite a bit of creative control to the more advanced photographer.<br />Quite frankly, short of buying a $6,000 Kodak professional digital camera, this is the best deal I found.<br />3x optical zoom is a definite selling point.  Never believe digital zoom ratings on cameras, while they might enlarge the image, they lose clarity and sharpness.  Most other cameras out there offer 2x optical, and 3x digital.  This camera has 3x optical, and 2x digital.  A definite advantage.<br />The Li-ion battery is an advantage and a disadvantage.  It has a nice long life, and it is certainly more environmentally friendly).  It is definitely cost effective, digital cameras eat batteries.  But, there is one problem.  It is not easy to just pick up and charge on the road.  If you plan on taking the camera away from power outlets, buy a spare battery and charger.  With regular batteries, any newstand can sell them to you.  The spare battery isn't cheap.  But, it is worth it.  It will pay for itself in about 10 sets of batteries (not long if you take a lot of pics).","I got this camera for my mother.  She loves it.  It's easy enough for her to use and it's packed with features.","I am an old 35mm photographer and output is my main concern.  I agree with PC Mag. who rated the DC4800 the #1 output in the over $500 range.  If you are looking for all the bells and whistles, go elsewhere.  This is a easy to use, user friendly camera.  Took the flash card down to a local pro camera store and when the image came up on their screen, they wanted to know what camera was used as they were really impressed.  This has all the options I need.  Don't want movies or sound, I have a digital video camera for that.  I have no complaints at all on this digital camera.  Well... ok, attach the lens cover and I am totally happy.","Well here goes. At my place of employment I was able to sell, repair and, most importantly, educate myself with digial imaging. I played around with some of the earlier Kodak's and Olympus models. When I got my hands on this machine last summer I was AMAZED. Not only was it simple to use, with an automatic function that finds the perfect shudder speed and ISO seeting, it also took phenomenal pictures. Although, I do not use the auto feauture anymore, it is ideal for amatures. The 3.1 megapixel quality is amazing. You truly come to appreciate the detail you get, untill you realize this camera picks up even the slighest blemish, pore, or discoloration on your skin! The detail is phenomenal. As some of my coworkers say, \"When you view the photograph, \"You'll find things on your skin that you never knew existed.\" I am impressed with this camera, as it has served me well for a couple of months now. Id say, for the price, this is the best camera for your money. Well done, Kodak!","I also had problems with poor quality indoors images until I talked to Kodak's customer support (5 stars to them also). Now that I know how to handle the camera its takes great pictures indoors or out.","First off--I'm spoiled, photographically: for years I've loved using good 35mm Minolta, Nikons and large format film cameras, mainly as an amateur photographer, but also as a freelance from time to time. When I took the digital plunge, I thought this camera would be more of a supplement to my other cameras. I was wrong--now I usually take the Kodak with me and leave the others behind. In short, this is just a great camera, which I've had for about two months now. It can be a bit complex to set up, and on \"Program\" the results are predictably just OK, but once you use it like a film camera the results are incredible. The control over many photographic settings--and the way Kodak has translated digital controls into \"35mm film\" settings(like ISO settings, effective focal lengths and such)--is simply fantastic. It's small enough to take with me when a full-blown 35mm Nikon setup is just too bulky (like when I'm biking); it also produces pictures that rival the 35mm. At first, I thought the indoor flash was a bit weak; you can hook up another set of flashes, however, for serious lighting. More importantly, I also found that when I set the camera properly for flash (fill works well, for instance), and proper ISO settings, that I got much better results. The macro and distance settings are effective as well, though I'm not sure why you need the distance setting with an autofocus camera. Flaws? Only in packaging--I wish that Kodak had included a case and neutral lens filter, but that's a very small complaint.","Very convenient controls. Any photographer will gert used to this camera in a few minutes, because it is designed as conventional cameras.<br />But most important is that the pictures really outshine others. I have compared this camera to the best 3+Mpixel cameras, and although in some areas it was not the best, the overall picture quality was consistantly the best....","After reading some of the negative reveiws, I felt I had to respond. Having used and tried many digital cameras including the Canon 3030 and Nikon 990, I can tell you that for the price you cannot buy a better camera.  The problems with focusing that people complain about is that they probably did not have the focus set properly.  There is a macro and infinity setting that has to be set correctly. I know because I had that problem at first but it was my fault. I use the camera in the OR all the time and NEVER have a problem with the focus. As far as the batteries, Kodak did it right. I can easily take 40 high quality pictures using the LED without recharging and the batteries are less than half the weight of 4 AA batteries. The Canon doesn't even include rechargeable batteries for $999. The controls are so user friendly that I can show the nurses how to take great pictures for me in 2 minutes.  Try that with the Canon which is way too confusing or even the bulky Nikon 990. I don't understand the \"problem\" with the flash - it works well to 10 ft which is all it was meant for.  The best part about the flash is that I can take pictures from 1 ft away and not overexpose the picture. All in all, it is a great compact 3 megapixel camera at a great price.","I recently acquired a DC4800. This is truly a great camera and compared to other digital cameras I used it is really good. The camera look and feel is much the same as a normal \"old\" camera, but with the feature a full fledge digital camera. It's always fun when people as you `when are you going to change the film?'  The viewfinder sits slightly on an awkward position but I don't find it irritating and one can still use the back panel display to preview the image. Picture quality is great at 3 MP and even good when working at lower resolution -yes sometimes we have to go there-.  The lition-ion battery is a great feature, and makes the whole camera lighter, easier to use (you can recharge when ever you want) and one gets a lot more battery life out of these babies, than normal nickel metal hydrates. Just for interest sake on one occasion I took 90 picture, with the flash on, with one battery.<br />All an all it is truly a great camera for people who are starting with digital imagery and like some advance feature to play around with. It also has the work and feel of a normal camera. Hope you enjoy yours.","I bought the DC4800 just prior to a trip to Europe.  The pictures were excellent until I went to recharge the batteries.  Unfortunately, the camera's charger was only 110v.  I ignorantly assumed the camera had a 110/220v recharger just like my computer, razor, video camera, alarm clock, and cell phone charger.  Since MOST high end electronics have a 110/220 transformer built in, I assumed as much from this camera.<br />To make a long story short, my batteries ran down by the 5th day of a 17 day trip and I was unable to find a transformer in Europe to step the voltage down to 110v.  Therefore, I had to resort to the good old 35mm.  I blame myself for this mistake, but I think that Kodak should provide a universal 110/220 charger for [this] camera.","I have owned a Kodak DC260, 280 and 290 and have enjoyed all of them, each being a little better in picture quality as the model number increased, but were lacking manual controls for when a great picture setting required it. That problem is gone with the DC4800. Sure, you can still take an automatic picture, but expect similar results that of its predecesors. Flip it to manual and experiment a little, this camera can deliver a picture that will rival the best that 35mm can offer. Simply awesome! Also in regards to batteries, standard AA would certainly have been cheaper but can not provide the same longevity or power capabilty that a lithium can provide (How many laptops do you see running AA batteries?)With lithium batteries, this camera can process three times as fast as my DC290. Bottom line, the difference between this camera and other Kodak cameras is that this one will take a little longer to figure out and seems to be geared for the serious amateur, but is definitely worth the extra time and money. I simply love it! If you are looking for an automated DC, I prefer the DC290, it seems to provide a better overall consistent shot for this mode.","I wouldn't write a review except I read some of the negative reviews below. All I can say is these people must have gotten a lemon from the first day of the assembly line or something. I bought the 4800 and it is awesome. The autofocus on mine was the first thing that impressed me when I looked at the output. It has not occured to me it has ever made a mistake. The depth of field is impressive. The thing is laid out perfectly and fits my hand like a glove.  The low light capability is like a spy camera out of a movie. The pictures, the most important thing, which come out of this camera are very very nice.<br />The default color choice out of the box I guess is suppose to emulate kodachrome. Sometimes it is a little too much, but the camera has a easy override which takes neutral coloration pictures when you want them. I think people and their clothes look better with the saturated color on but when you need accurate color it can be yours immediately. The zoom has a stop before it gets to the digital, it isn't that hard to detect it for me. The flash works with the auxiliary lenses which block the nikon 990.<br />I will say that while the flash is not physically blocked with any of the auxiliary lenses, the professional quality wide angle lense is very large and does cast a shadow on wide angle shots of art work in the lower right corner from a distance of three or four feet. How many times  you use wide angle lenses in a dark room from four feet with the flash will determine how big a problems this is. The camera has such good low light capability you can, I feel, get around this.<br />The batteries are suppose to be expensive. Why? because they allow you to shoot, with the LCD ON, 40 pictures or so without a problem. The cheap AA batteries belong on a cheap camera. This is suppose to be a nice camera and have a power system that has some oomph. It does. This camera should be about 1100 dollars with the other top prosumer cameras. That it costs only what it does is the achievement to fixate on.","I've read several reviews of the Kodak DC4800 and agree with most of the positive reviews and very little of the negative ones...<br />Now, prospective  wise, this is my very first digital camera so I can offer my opinion with  no previous digital camera experience.  I have used several upper high end  35mm cameras in my life and do know a little more than your average  shooter; with that in mind, I will continue with my review.<br />First of all,  I got much more than I actually expected.  All of my enlargments and prints  have been done on my HP Deskjet 970CXI printer with Kodak Glossy Inkjet 45  pound paper...some were enlarged and printed from the lowest megapixel  level (.8) and others were done with the highest megapixel (3.1)  The  results have been much better than expected...the color was terrific and  the detail was excellent.<br />The only pictures I took which I considered  below excellent quality were, for the most part, due to my mistakes  regarding settings, movement when shooting in low light and perhaps greater  expectations from the flash than you would normally get with a good 35mm  camera...now, a couple of the reviews have mentioned that the flash and  focus when taking pictures inside or with low light were far below the  quality they were expecting.  They may well have a point, however, I  attributed these lower quality shots more to my inexperience with the  camera and wrong settings than I actually was willing to blame on the  camera....when I became more familiar with the limits of the camera, I was  able to overcome 95 % of my original poorer quality shots...in other words,  when I actually understood the limitations of the camera, I was able to  take much better photos with clearly focused shots and excellent  color...<br />Now, a word about expectations;  I never really counted on any  camera giving me 100 % of everything I expected...it just isn't reality.  Different cameras within different price ranges simply are not going to hit  our needs 100 % of the time.  With my zero level experience with digital  cameras and years of amateur level 35mm work, I simply was willing to  forgive a few shortcomings if I got what I consider excellent pictures 95 %  of the time.<br />Some have commented on the lame flash which is built into  the camera...I never actually expected a lot from it so I was not  disappointed when the shots taken from more than ten feet were not as good  as one might expect.  On the other hand, the camera does have a connection  to attach a higher end external flash unit so I would tend to think that  even this objection might be overcome if one were to use a good external  flash unit.  I would be interested in hearing some reports. Like any other  camera shooting in low light, if it drops to a longer shutter speed, you  had better keep it still or go to a tripod for more stability.  I actually  attributed a couple of my poor shots to this rather than a focus problem.<br />Having said the above, I do consider myself a novice digital photograpy  buff, however, I can tell you, if you want a camera which is a whole lot of  fun and gives you excellent options to venture more into creative control,  I  would consider getting one.  If, however, you are expecting an end all,  do all, camera, I seriously doubt if you can find one on the market.  Perhaps the extremely high end professional cameras can give you lots of  what your looking for, however, I tend to think that even they have  limitations...","I have read and studied the features on just about every digital camera  available. I had even ordered this camera's predessor when I saw an ad in  our Sunday  paper anouncing the DC 4800. I changed my order and I am really  glad I did so. This camera performs as advertised. The photographic quality  at all resolutions meets or exceeds comparable  photos I have seen by  several other top manufacturers.  I have taken appx 200 pictures with the  camera so far. I have failed to exhaust battery life in any one session.  (This was one of my original concerns about getting a digital camera.) I  have also purchased a 96MB flash card. For my purposes this is overkill.  Even at highest resolution, in any compression mode, 64 MB should be enough  for the average outing. Of course, if TIFF configuration is desired get the  most you can afford.  This camera is much more than I expected. Operating  instructions are excellent and easy to use. Follow Quick Start  and you'll  be going in a few minutes.  The photo software is easy to use but  at  novice level. But  I guess that helped in keeping the price down. Most  folks who own a scanner already have more advanced software anyway. Final  Words: Boy, am I happy with camera.","I've only had this camera for a week, but I'm extreamly happy with it.  For basic point and shoot on low energy setting, it seems to do very well  with battery life.  But no matter, definitely buy an extra batter with  charger (you can get it directly from Kodak if you can't find it here).<br />I  agree with a previous reviewer where the extended lense is visible through  the viewfinder.  I haven't received my extra lenses yet (wide angle, tele,  closeup), but I'm sure that will be even more of a problem with those.  I  suspect with lense attachments this is not uncommon.  In those cases you  may want to use the LCD screen for direct through the lense viewing  anyway.<br />The 3.1 megapixel resolution is really, really nice.  I can't  believe I ever lived without it.  When you printout a large format image,  you can really see the difference.  This aspect of course will be true of  any 3.x MP camera.  By the way, somewhat unrelated, don't bother using the  digital zoom.  The optical one is excellent, and for digital zooming, it's  better to do the very same effect in Photoshop where you have better  control.  I just turned that effect off on my camera which is a real nice  thing to be able to do by the way.<br />The real excitement, however, happens  when you venture into any of the manual settings.  You have really nice  control over white balance (e.g. setting Kelvins directly or adjusting  based on known lighting, or adjusting based on a white card in the image,  etc.), over color modes (sepia, B&W, several color modes), exposure  metering, ISO, exposure settings, and shutter speeds.  I think Kodak has  done a real good job with these.  It also puts some of the settings  physically on the camera so you can adjust them without going into the menu  (on the LCD screen) including f-stop, exposure compensation (handy to  quickly deal with backlight subjects), distance/closeup (which forces a  fixed focus), delayed snap, and burst mode.  The burst mode is really cool,  but I find it only interesting when using in the smallest resolution  (1080x720) where you get a burst of 16 pictures.<br />What can I say, this is  really fun.  When my wide angle attachment arrives, I will also venture  into using this along with my kaidan attachment for VR photography.  The  software is pretty reasonable and allows full control by an attached laptop  in those professional situations where you're taking thousands of images  for a VR tour.  By the way, the included AC adapter will be a life saver in  that case too.  Also, if you really want to get exotic, Kodak makes all of  the software development kits free so you can develop your own software to  manage the camera or the resulting collection of images.  But that is  probably going a bit far for most people.","In short, the camera performs terribly well.  It is VERY fast, you can  take several pictures in a row before buffer fills, and it is a very simple  to use product.<br />But dont be fooled by its size, this monster has enough  manual features to substitute a studio cam.<br />Camera is very sturdy,  comes with everything you need, and in fact includes the great Arcsoft  Panorama maker software, which is not mentioned anywhere.  It created  stunning panoramas and 360 degree views.<br />Complains:  16Mb is too little  RAM.  However, camera price is relatively low compared to all other 3 MPX  ones.<br />Would recommend to get the expansion pack with it, which includes  an extra battery, charger and a GREAT camera bag with enough space for all  cables, accessories, etc.","This is Kodak's entry into the 3 megapixel market (and some reports indicate that this is the first of Kodak's digital cameras to be designed  by Kodak Japan), and considering that Kodak did so well at 2MP with the  DC280, one expects a formidable digital camera, and gets it, for the most  part.  This is my second Kodak digital camera and I've continued to  purchase Kodak because with digital cameras the camera is also the film and  no one knows how to make film quite like Kodak, a la Kodachrome.  The  previous DC280 is a point and shoot camera only, and while the DC4800  offers manual control of many functions, it still basicaslly a point and  shoot camera - for instance, with the DC4800 no control of focus is  possible, and if you want to change shutter speed you have to go through  several levels of menu (no less than 10 button presses to get to the  shutter speed menu and then as much as another 12 to choose the speed).  Hopefully, as the digital era progresses digital cameras will become more  like the SLRs of old with manual control of every function and all the  controls on the body of the camera, rather then buried deep in menus.  (I  understand Olympus is about to release its E10 which is like a digital SLR;  however the price will be about $2000.)<br />That given, lets examine the  Kodak DC4800.<br />The positives -<br />For me, after the 3MP resolution and the  3X lens, what impresses me most about the DC4800 is the high quality, high  contrast, high resolution, high brightness backpanel LCD, which is now  truly useful, unlike that on the DC280.  The backpanel controls have also  been improved somewhat with a 4 axis \"joy\" button. The camera has  a strap post on each side of the body so one can use a neckstrap; the  wide/telephoto control is a \"wiggle\" switch under the thumb; and  the viewfinder has a diopter control for those of us needing glasses.  The  DC4800 communicates with the computer through USB only (and unlike the  DC280 can be used at the same time as other USB devices) and acts just like  a flash card reader appearing to the computer as a external, removable  drive, with the fast downloading of a reader.  The front of the DC4800 lens  is well protected, unlike the DC2800.  The manual is typical Kodak well  done, but strangely enough, as with the DC280 manual, the markings in the  viewfinder are not explained.  Exposure after pressing the shutter button  in almost instantaneous and despite the larger file size of a 3MP file,  saving the the file to the CF is considerably faster that the DC280.  Digital zooom is surprisingly good, thanks to the 3MP high density.<br />The  negatives -<br />I was very surprised to find that the lens barrel appears in  the lower right corner of the viewfinder at 28mm; I don't know if this is  not unusual for a point and shoot as I've never owned one before, but I  come close to finding it unacceptable.  The battery situation with the  DC4800 is not much improved so far as I can tell, even though the camera  uses an expensive (proprietary?) Kodak lithium-ion battery; the user will  surely have to invest in a $80 battery and charger kit if extended and  away-from-the-home use in anticipated.  Like the DC280, the battery cover  of the DC4800 can be knocked open by a blow to the bottom of the camera  body - those comtemplating active use should secure the battery cover with  tape.  The DC4800 is supplied with only a 16MB CF card and the buyer can  expect to spend an additional $200+ on a large CF card, which along  with  the $80 extra battery and charger will amount to an additional $300+  investment.  The camera acts only as a CF reader and is not TWAIN  compliant, which leads to lots of inconveniences in saving files.  The  backpanel LCD gets dark in sunlight.  As with the DC280, the tripod mount  is plastic and apparently not intended for serious use.<br />One additional  comment - those buying a digital camera should check back with the  manufacturer for updated firmware - in Kodak's case there were lots of  early complaints about battery life problems with the DC280 which were  largely solved with later firmware.","Fell in love with a friend's Kodak DC280 and started researching to see which camera would best suit me. Decided it was the DC4800 because of the  high 3.1 megapixel resolution. It has performed wonderfully. Installation  was extremely smooth and everything works as advertised. Lots of great  features. I especially like the compact size and traditional camera looks.  A few of the more commonly used settings are accessible without going  through a menu (like exposure compensation, and apperture priority  settings).<br />And I use Windows 2000 which the camera works with without  exception.","The picture quality on this camera is one of the best.(3.1 mega pixel) The  file sizes are a little large but if you get a 64 or 128 flash card you  will have plenty of space.  You can set it to emulate 100 200 and 400 film  quality.  The lintium battery solves all the battery problems that the  dc280 and dc290 had.  The dc4800 is far more advanced then any other kodak  camera.  If your main priority is high quality photos this is the camera  for you.","The picture quality on this camera is one of the best.(3.1 mega pixel) The file sizes are a little large but if you get a 64 or 128 flash card you  will have plenty of space.

Is it a very good camera for the price, yes. (...)<br />I paid about [x] for a D30 body, with the 1GB Microdrive+extra battery as free rebates from Canon. (...) If you figure the rebate was worth about $500, then I paid about [x] for the body.<br />(...) The bottom line seems to be the D30 makes images about as good as typical 35 MM color film (I'd bet not as good as Kodachrome though).<br />I did find the camera took some getting used to. For example, washed out highlights sometimes get color fringes and unprocessed images look flat and quite unsharp. After learning about sharpening and contrast adjustment (Photoshop unsharp mask <search web for \"D30 unsharp mask\" for details>), I'm pretty pleased with the image quality. Being able to instantly get a image histogram moments after snapping a picture is a GREAT way to analyze the contrast range of a scene, and makes me now think how photography with a film camera was totally lacking in immediate feedback about picture quality.<br />A few features are not so well documented (if you read the manual enough times it's in there), like if you activate mirror lock up, the self timer is 2 seconds instead of 10, perfect for long tripod exposures. I also didn't immediatly realize how important the dial on the back was (needed for white balance selection, exposure compensation, and manual mode control). Speaking of white balance, it's GREAT to snap a picture of a neutral (white) surface (I use a 18% grey card), and instantly get the camera to adjust the color balance. Remember daylight and tungsten filters for film?<br />I suppose you can use fully automatic mode for quick pictures of UFO's flying by, but think this is a camera more for people who LIKE to adjust things for best quality.<br />The ONLY reservation I have is resolution being 3.25 megapixels. There are now 5-6 megapixel cameras, but they either cost a LOT more (like the Canon D1...) or else loose a lot of that SLR'ness. Like no TTL viewfinder on the Sony 707 (...), and no interchangable lenses on the Olympus E-20 (at the same price or more as my effectiveprice on the D30). I was very surprised to find that EVERYBODY rates the number of pixels based on all colors. A 3 megapixel digital camera has generally 1.5 megapixels of green sensors, 0.75 of read and blue. This means in a 3 Megapixel RGB image, 2/3 of the final data is made up from interpolation. In my book, that's not REALLY 3 megapixels. Some higher end prosumer/pro video cameras have three sensors, one for each color, although these do cost more.<br />Based on everything I know now (a lot more) I would still probably buy the D30... (...) I can't think of ANY alternatives that give so much for the price.","Of all the digital cameras I have owned or looked at, this is the best.  Yes, its pricey, but well worth every penny.  I take a lot of NASCAR action shots and this camera has not missed one yet.  Its fairly easy to use, once you get used to it and takes great pictures in full sun and at night.  I really like the fact that I can change lenses for different shots.  If you want the ultimate digital SLR camera on the market now, get this one.","...in light of my needs and the state of competitive offerings from Nikon, it's only a mediocre product now. In November 2000 it was a good enough product to prompt me to switch from the Minolta family (incuding the 1.75 MP RD-175 digital SLR) to Canon after 25 years. However, it has some well-documented short-comings. Two that affect everyone are the really poor software and the slow/inaccurate autofocus, especially in low light. The other that affects sports photographers is the slow speed, and general lack of robustness. These issues will be resolved with the introduction of the EOS 1D in late November/early December. The auto-focus is promised to be the same as the EOS 1V and the speed will be up to 8 fps with enough memory to take a 21-shot burst.The body is based on the 1V as well, so it will be enviromentally sealed and tough enough for pro use. We can only hope that Canon gets the software right this time. You can expect to see the 1D in general use by PJ's covering the Salt Lake Olympics - there should be plenty of feedback then. My D30 will not be consigned to eBay just yet though - at $9000Cdn, I won't be getting two 1D's, so the D30 will stay in service as my 2nd body.","...<br />We have tried many digital and analog camera and we are currently working with a total of 7 cameras and one of the most valuable is the D-30.<br />Our main digital photo cameras are Olympus E-10 and Canon D-30. Both are working well with MicroDrive 340 MB.<br />A little comparison of the two cameras :<br />The Canon D-30 camera is perfectly designed for photo reports, quick sequences, dynamic pictures and offers the possibility to change the lense. We use this camera specially outdoor and she delivers brilliant pictures. The way how to make pictures with the D-30 is very similar to analog photography.<br />Olympus E-10 has a higher resolution, perfect for more artistical oriented pictures, the chip and the lense are very sensible for light and you can shoot in dark conditions. The camera is working slowly and quick senquences or dynamic pictures are very diffcult to shoot. The feeling of making pictures with the E-10 is different from traditional analog photography and only experience will teach the photographer to make correct decisions, specially regarding dark light conditions and the usage of flash.<br />In other words, if you are searching for a camera that : - will mainly be used outdoor - should have changeable lenses (compatible with almost all Canon EF lenses) - setting quickly the correct autofocus - storing quickly the pictures - displaying quickly the images in the control LCD monitor - large battery and image storing capacities then the D-30 is exactly what you need.<br />Precautions : - use only brand compact flash memories (we had problems with CompactFlash memories of different noname producers) - MicroDrives should not exceed 340 MB (big MicroDrives become hot and the reliability of the camera is not insured) - 1 battery pack should be enough for approximately 600 pictures. Think to buy enough battery packs.","If you are looking for your first digital SLR and do not have an investment in Nikon lenses (or you wish to switch), this one is for you!<br />Images from the camera are great - inherently soft but can be sharpened using Unsharp Mask without that much degradation in quality. Images are one of the cleanest (noise-free) at high ISOs (up to 1600).<br />Invest on an EX flash and those IS and/or L lenses, too.","The D30 is a great camera and takes outstanding photos. I will put it up against my friend's Nikon any day and his camera cost much more. The battery life on the D30 is amazing as I expected the same life as that on the Nikon. Instead, the battery on the D30 just keeps shooting after the Nikon is dead. This is not to knock the Nikon as it is one of the premier cameras around and is a true professional camera, but the Canon will match it picture for picture for less money. Either camera will make you a very happy photographer. I regularly use a Canon EOS  35mm. camera so the transition to the digial is very easy as the controls are so similar. The fact that I can use my Canon image stabilized lenses makes it even better. The D30 does call for one of the EX flash units, so that will add to the cost; however, the on-camera flash also works well . Picture quality is outstanding. I have had no problem with the software, but I generally download all pictures to my  computer  and do any adjusting, etc. with Photoshop. Hookup to the computer by way of USB is a snap and downloading is fast.","Who doesn't want to own a cool camera!<br />A few months ago, I wanted to buy a EOS3000 so I can pick up photography, but instead, I got myself a Sony digital camera. The feel of a digital camera is somehow still very different to a SLR camera.<br />Last month, got myself a D30, a combination of a digital and SLR style is just perfect!!!<br />Every shot I take now is almost \"perfect\"!<br />Thank you Canon!","All of the nice things you're hearing about this camera are true.  If you already own a camera in the Canon EOS line and are ready to upgrade to digital, this is the path you want to take.  It has all the features a sophisticated amateur wants, plus a healthy serving of \"professional\" features thrown in.  And as others have said, all the lenses and most (not all) of the accessories you already have will work with the D30.<br />There are a few drawbacks, however... For one thing the autofocus relies on an incandescent lamp rather than the infrared found in nearly all other EOS models.  This is a curious choice on Canon's part, it almost seems like they didn't throw in professional-quality autofocus for marketing reasons, since there's a true pro-level Canon digital SLR due out later this year.<br />Another drawback is that the included software, called ZoomBrowser EX, is not that great.  It's designed to help you capture, download, and catalog your digital images, but it runs out of steam once your image library grows to a non-trivial size, and if you want to merge databases because you've done collection on another computer, the software more-or-less becomes unusable.<br />Also, you end up paying a lot more than $3000, even if you already have the lenses from your other Canon EOS camera.  First comes the Compact Flash cards (you really need to get at least two of these so you always have a spare).  Figure on getting at least two 128MB CF cards, if you really must have a microdrive that will cost you more.  Plan on getting an extra battery too.  Then there are the Canon accessories, like a better (infrared) autofocus lamp, an electronic timer for long exposures and intervalometer work (which the included remote-capture software does not do well), and you get the idea...  you really have to budget $4000.<br />Having said all that, this camera really is a joy to use, and once you get used to the instant feedback, your shooting skills will improve, and you'll start getting compliments on how good you are.  It really *is* that *good* of a camera.  Just be warned that you are jumping into the deep end of digital photography if you get this camera.  ... ;-).","Awesome Camera.  If you are interested in the sharpest digital photos this is the camera for you.  I recommend the Canon EOS D30 unequivocally; it is the best you can buy without breaking the bank.  If you already own one of the Canon EOS' then your lenses will fit.  The compact flash included is pretty skimpy and my Speedlite 430EZ didn't work.  Picture quality is outstanding.  Read some of the comparisons with the Nikon and you will see that the D30 beats it for about two grand less.  I am totally enthusiastic about it.  The instruction booklet is clear and easy to follow.  You can use the new 340MB to 1 gig mini-drives to store a whole vacations worth of pictures.  I recommend the Speedlite 550EX to expand your abilities.","I consider myself an advanced amateur. Just got a new D 30 and found two issues: a 128MB Microtech card, formatted in the camera, would take 10 photos and then freeze the camera. I have to take out the camera battery to \"reboot\" the camera. This is very disturbing, the same card has been working with no problems on another camera and a Microtech reader.I tried a smaller capacity San Disk card (32MB) and had no problems.<br />Continuing the same tradition as in other Canon products, the small print limited warranty card does not mention any extended service agreements for sale (as other manufacturers offer), so I have to assume that if the camera breaks down after a year, I am facing high repair costs.<br />The camera takes nice photos, but I now regret I didn't wait until Nikon comes out with a competitive (price and features) model.","If you want the ultimate in digital photography, the Canon D30 is the ticket as of December 2000 -- especially if you already own Canon EOS lenses, because they're completely compatible. Canon won't call this a \"Pro\" camera, because it's not as weather-tight as pro models, but the body is rugged and the output is first-rate.<br />The D30 has enough features for professional photographers, yet a novice can get great looking pictures from the start. As you learn more about the camera and its capabilities, your images really start to shine.<br />Want to experiment with long-exposure photography? Go right ahead! Feedback is instant. No more waiting for processing. No more developing costs. Want to blow up your photo to 8x12 inches? No problem. With a little massaging via Adobe Photoshop (tm) and/or Genuine Fractals (tm), even poster-sized prints look great, using photo paper and a photo-quality inkjet printer. Software to get you going, including Photoshop LE, is included.<br />The D30 accepts IBM Microdrives (1 gigabite of storage in the camera!) as well as compact flash. The included 16 meg flash card is enough to test the camera, but you'll really want to get something bigger, right away. The D30 offers a variety of image compression options -- including the Raw format, which allows the most flexibility and avoids jpeg artifacts. The wide variety of storage options means freedom to shoot at will and experiment. An included cable allows you to connect your camera to your computer's USB port and download images at will.<br />As I said, all Canon EOS lenses will work with the D30, but there is one difference to consider. Because the CMOS chip is smaller than a 35mm negative, the field of view is different. For example, a 100 mm lens on an EOS film camera works like a 160 mm lens on the D30. They call it a 1.6x multiplier effect, but what it means is that long-distance shooting is easier, and to get wide angle shots, you have to get a REALLY wide lens. For example, a 14mm aspherical wide angle results in a 22mm wide angle shot on the D30.<br />When the D30 was first released in the Fall of 2000, the demand was far beyond what Canon could produce... in the United States and around the World. As of this writing, the cameras are still in short supply, but well worth the effort and the investment. Kudos to Amazon for adding the D30 to their digital photography offerings."]},{"name":"Olympus C-3000 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["very happy with my purchase","The camera is great but when I received it the batteries were corroded in the camera.

This camera takes great pics, allows you to record short videos with sound and so on. My only advice is to invest in rechargeable batteries, or stock up on the AA, because this thing is a battery hog! Great deal, though.","I have had this camera going on 6 years and it is still working strong and taking great picutres. Yes, there are newer cameras out there, but I still use this one. I replaced another brand digital camera in less than 6 months as it turned all pictures green with this model and no problems since. I got an all in 1 printer last year and my pictures download nicely to my computer with the HP printer software with no problems and I can also download family's newer pictures too (other olypmus cameras.)","I had this Olympus for many years now and it's still working GREAT!  After Olympus, I've owned PowerShot, Finepix (2 of them) and I have to say this C3000 is still my favorite!  It's the only camera I know that allows zoom function while recording video.","This was my first digital camera and lucky me! The pictures are absolutely crystal clear! I bought mine \"refurbished\" and I still haven't had any problems with it and I've had it for 3 years now. The pictures taken in daylight are absolutely astonishing, I'm telling you. I think the only thing I regret is that it doesn't have a manual focus, but the autofocus is just so good, I really hardly ever miss it.<br /><br />I took a photography class and used the Canon Digital Rebel as well as the Nikon D70 for shots for the class as well as this camera, and honest to god, every time I used my own camera people would ask \"which camera did you use for that?!\" they were so impressed when I'd tell them it was my own 3.2 megapixel one instead of the hearty 8mp thing. I'm sure if you're a professional photographer you might need all the doodads that the other cameras offer, but for me, the amateur, this is perfect.<br /><br />Check out my pictures in the gallery!","I've used my C3000 for years. While it's only 3.2MP, I momentarily relegated to a shoebox while a new 5MP Sony DSC-P93 took the limelight.<br /><br />I ended up selling the Sony and going back to the Olympus, which takes outstanding shots indoors and out.","Having been a veteran of the SLR scene, I waited a long time to buy a digital camera. I have now had my C-3000 for 3 years and it is still performing excellently. Only 3.3 megapxels? No problem. Unless you are printing poster sized pictures, who needs more? (unless you really want to get SLR quality, which I believe is now possible). True, this was expensive when I bought it (equivalent of $1,000), but the number of photos I have taken has saved me this in processing fees. It is easy to use and if you are daring enough has enough interesting advanced features. Once I figured out how to depress the button slightly for autofocusing etc, I could do panning shots.<br /><br />The downside: Yes, the lens cap does tend to get lost, but my brother has a later version with string attached. The LCD panel gets scratched, but I have not noticed diminished monitor quality. Olympus tell you not to use it outside in cold weather because of condensation problems. Does this not apply to all electronics, or is it a problem with this camera?<br /><br />I am shortly going to purchase a 128mb card, as they are now cheap. I can't find any limitations on card size, so I hope it is OK. The CAMEDIA software is OK, but the USB connection is a little sensitive. PICASA does not pick up this camera at all-it senses otyher digitals.<br /><br />Overall, I think in its class this is a classic, just like the Olympus OM-1/10 was a classic SLR. If you can pick one up second-hand, do so. Just check that LCD screen.","bought this camera not too long ago, great camera, takes great pictures. probably not as expensive now as before, which is a good thing for those who need a great camera at a low price. Although I am looking to sell my camera, anyone intrested can email wfpod@hotmail.com or call my cell phone at 19787643720.","I reviewed many camera's for months before i purchased this camera.  I have been using this camera for two years and counting without a problem. I think the picture quality is excellent and this camera is very durable.  I have used most of the features and found it to live up to all my photography needs.  The only negatives are the len cap needs to be removed before powering up the camera and the 16meg smartmedia that comes with it is way to small in size for multi picture taking.  But still a great camera.","I've clicked away through Costa Rica, Ireland, Lake Tahoe (skiing - finally lost the easily popped-off lens cap) and many other places. Excellent camera - sometimes need to \"touch up\" photos, but overall sturdy, great image quality and full of features. I am extremely satified with Olympus cameras - both film and digital (I also use Pentax film and Canon ELPH digital).","Bought this camera 15 months ago. First attempt at digital photography.  There are not enough words to describe this GREAT Camera.  Only down side is the lens cap. Yes, I have lost mine. Someone could make a fortune selling lens caps.<br />Battery life is great. Photos are out of this world, sharp, clear, absolutely incredible.","For those of you not very familiar with all the technical madness of digital cameras,like me =).Buy this cam its worth every dollar. It really captures the moment. Buy yourself some good rechargable batts, and your on your way to clicking great pics.","I'll start with the bad:<br />1-lens cap is a major problem as I almost lost it 50 times or so as it popped off and rolled, plus if you leave it on and turn on the camera, it makes a horrible grinding noise, not good, it should have been built in<br />2-its a little big but not huge, its more bulky than anything<br />Good:<br />1-lot of features<br />2-takes pretty good pictures, some examples you can see at<br />[...]  all of which were taken with the camera<br />I would probably go with the Nikon at the same price level, although the Nikon is a little more $$ and doesnt have all the features the olympus has...but the lens cap thing is a major pain","I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this camera.  I even bought a different model but exchanged it for the C3000 due to the overwhelming reviews and first hand experience.  My first camera was a Canon AE1 so it was important to have flexibility with aperature settings, lighting, focus, etc.  The colors of my photos are vibrant and warm.  I've even shot some unbelievable b/w photos, which I printed and framed (8x10).  Friends can't believe that they were taken by a digital camera.  The only downside to this and many of the digital cameras is the shooting range is short.  SLR photographers...don't expect to get those great close-ups with this camera unless your subject is right there.  And the shutter speed is slow so you won't be taking many action shots with this camera.<br />I use a 128 mb card and can shoot 70 shots per card with the SHQ setting.  Once the card is full, I transfer the shots to a CD, reformat the card and I'm ready to shoot again.  Plus, I can then pick and choose the shots I want to print....saving a ton of money on film processing.<br />Overall...for the money and quality....I'm very satisfied with my first digital camera.","Like many of the other reviewers, I carefully researched dozens of models and felt this one fit my needs for a point-and-shoot as well as an SLR.  But the best aspect of this product is that it takes terrific pictures, even in the simplest-to-use modes.  One thing I feared about digital was the quality of the photo's composition - digital tends to have a reputation for producing a \"cold\" picture.  The results from this camera, however, were warm with a great color balance and good depth.  I have printed quality 5x7s and 8x10s.  The camera is easy to understand and simple to use.  It would be nice if the lens cap could be tethered somehow.","Camera is easy to use and light weight. The screen is not to small, yet not so large to suck up your batteries if you use it as the view finder. Lots of modes to change your resolutions and quite easy to do. Nice to be able to set your defaults.<br />The only think that I wish this camera had is a better zoom. Great for taking picures 15 ft. or closer, but if you want to take shots that are far away, it is not that good.","Things I like:<br />1) The 32mm lense, so you can get more into your picture. MOst DC have 35mm, and lots of zoom. I don't need that much of zoom personally.<br />2) Full manual control, great! Just like the SLR old days.<br />3) Very nice colors, especially when developed by better equiments, I assume shutterfly.com has better printer than I do.<br />Things I DON'T like:<br />1) The lense cap is very easy to get lost<br />2) The LCD has no automatic brightness control, so in a darker room, you see darker image, which is not qhat you really want to see.<br />3) Sequential, panoramic modes can only work with olympus brand SM! This makes my 128M card not useable for these features!<br />4) Optical paralax<br />5) Easy to get scatched LCD<br />6) Big!<br />Still I like the camera, don't take me wrong. It is in several ways better than the 3020/3030 models.","This is a great camera for the money...when I bought this one was the best 3.3 meg pix camera under $500.00 now there may be more options out there so shop around. Only defaults unable to use filters and cannot exchange lens...excelent quality of prints though...and many choices for programing or to use manual settings...","Former owner of the SONY Mavica FD-5 (first dig. camera using floppy disks to store images), then the Panasonic Digital camera FP-2090 which saves images to 120-meg super disk. Went w/the 3000zoom because [another store] had it for 10% off their everyday price ... and the PNY Smart Media 128meg cards were on sale for TWO for ...! They also threw in a PNY USB Smart Media reader for FREE! How could I refuse?<br />On to the camera - I took about 50 pictures at the second-highest resolution (SHQ) and they were higher resolution than my laptop video card & monitor could handle because they looked oversaturated and had a cross-hatch pattern. Took out the SM card, plugged it into my USB reader, downloaded them to my desktop PC & manipulated the images w/MGI Photosuite 3. This program can resize the images, enhance the image w/a one-button click and do just about anything you want with the pictures.<br />Love the images, but still NO 35mm comparison yet. My complaints about the camera regard the setups. Kinda time-consuming to bracket the shot and set it up properly. No where near a logical set-up. Guess I'll have the cliff-divers in Acapulco wait in mid-air while I set this ... up. Would be much more beneficial to have pre-programmed buttons to save time. Pretty funky that the extension tube sticks out for EVERYTHING, including picture review. No rechargeable batteries - How come? Even my bottom-of-the-barrel Mavica came w/a charger and NiMH. Smart Media is cheap, that's good. I'll use the 8meg included card as a back-up to my 256 megs of storage. I'll still keep my 35mm, because Olympus doesn't have it right yet.","I bought the C3000, on the strength of having used the c2020 at work, where we've had ten cameras for about six months now with no reported faults or complaints. The C3000 was the natural choice of camera for me, mainly because of the full manual facility that it offers as well as a 9Mb TIFF option.<br />My only gripe about the camera is that the external flash socket has been changed from the standard two pin pc connector to the dedicated 5 pin type for the Olympus dedicated flashgun ( not even the same fitting as the older T32 type) The C2020 works very well using studio flash equipment and is ideal for checking out lighting st ups for large format photography. No chance with the 3000 however.....anyway I guess that's a small price to pay, and the majority of users wouldn't want to use external flash.<br />One point about the software, every time the panarama option was chosen on the computer, it bombed out. Full marks to Olympus, 12 hours after e-mailing them with the symptom, they sent a patch to fix the problem.<br />To round off, a great (not so little) camera for the money, there are smaller lighter ones on the market that fit in the pocket easier, but nothing to match the options offered by the C3000....Just hope I feel the same way about it in six months!","I purchased my second digital camera since leaving the 35mm life behind.  My first was a Sony (pre-Mavica) first generation. It had 640x480 resolution and left a lot to be desired.  That's where Olympus comes in.<br />I've never gotten better pictures, digitally, since my Nikon 8080 35mm camera.  Regardless of the lighting conditions, I seem to take perfect pictures, through no fault of my own.  I put the setting at P for automatic and the pictures at 3.3 megapixel quality make perfect printed photos; even at 8x10 size.  I would highly recommend this great product to anyone who wants the ability to use fully automatic or programmable modes.  It even records QuickTime movies, although that's probably the only drawback to me as I've not been successful in creating any good ones. For a great value and excellent quallity, with USB capability, I'd recommend the Olympus, hands down.","After putting in a lot of time researching digital cameras I finally decided on the c-3000 and couldn't be happier.  The picture quality is superb and the special features are easy to use and provide incredible flexibility.  I've had no problems witht he battery life, and the lens cap doesn't seem to be as much of a nuisance as others have made it out to be.  One of my favorite features so far is the quicktime movie recording mode.  Although it's not the highest quality, you can also record sound, and a fairly long video clip, I recommend a high capacity smartmedia card, i have a 128mb.  The only things I have noticed that aren't fantastic is a small delay when zooming with the optical zoom, and a somewhat confusing setup for choosing the desired picture quality.  Overall this camera is a great buy, I highly recommend it to anyone!","I just purchased this camera, and must admit that I didn't do a lot of research before making the purchase. Talk about luck, the C3000 is a great camera and came with more features than I expected. It was incredibly easy to use and the menu system made it easy to navigate.<br />I'd suggest picking up another memory card, 8mb isn't enough to store more than 4-5 TIFF photos.<br />A great camera for a beginner!","I love to take photographs and have used this camera exclusively this past year with great results.  Unfortunately, my regular cameras and lenses are gathering dust!  I have a Film Reader 4 I use to download pictures to my computer, which is a must.  I also have rechargeable batteries - also a must!  The red eye feature works very well.  The short movies are ok if the lighting is right.  I just upload to Ofoto.com and print any pictures I want professionally developed at a fraction of the cost I used to pay, as I only develop the good ones!  Also great for e-mailing!  I don't use the software that came with it for editing pictures - I find my scanner software more powerful.  I have 3 memory cards which are great when traveling!","I got my C-3000 for Xmas last year, and have been using it regularly for almost a year.<br />Some things I like about it:<br />-It takes very high resolution pictures.  This is especially useful if you are a novice such as myself and need to liberally crop to have a nice picture (you won't end up with a grainy mess).<br />-It's small and easy to hold.<br />-It has quicktime video (which I didn't think I would use, but certainly has come in handy).<br />-It is fairly quick to recover between shots.<br />-It takes AA rechargeable batteries, and standard memory cards- both easy to get and not overly expensive.<br />-It has a nifty remote control.<br />-The Camedia software is very easy to use, and I have had no problem at all uploading pictures from the camera using the usb cable included.<br />Some things that I don't like:<br />-It makes a horrible grinding noise if you turn it on w/o taking the lens cover off!<br />-It is unwieldy to page through menus to control aperture/focal length settings.  Dial control of this (like on regular cameras) would be a huge bonus.<br />-If you buy the adapter lens kit, you must remove it everytime you shut your camera off (because the fitting is on the retractable lens)  Not very convenient at all.<br />Overall, I have been extremely happy with this camera, especially for the price.","After store visiting and on-line reviewing, I decided to buy C3000. I agree with most of the reviewers: it is indeed easy to use and is a great camera. The feature I like the most is its manual operation. The picture info is like a professional coach that guides me in photography! It is this feature that allowed me to take the first successful night picture.<br /> (...)","I purchased the Olympus C3000Z after recommendation of a friend and considerable research in the <(dollar amount), 3 megapixel range.  I've used film cameras, 35mm 2.5x2.5, and point and shoot for years and so far after about month this camera is an excellent choice.  I've used the Nikon 990 (about $(dollar amount)at work and the Olympus lens and picture quality seems to be, so far comparable.<br />Downloading with the USB cable and Olympus software is a breeze, but don't expect to do much manipulation of the image with this software.  I use Picture IT! software and presently looking at other inexpensive, usable software for an amateur like me.<br />I took note of the problems with the lens cap, dropped mine several times and forgot to remove when turning on the camera, but I visited my local (...) and purchased a \"tether\" for less than $(dollar amount) that sticks on the cap and connects to the strap or strap attachment. It has become a habit to automatically take off the cap after removing from the camera bag and before turning on the camera.<br />A family picture taken with the camera will be printed with a HP 952C Deskjet on Christmas card paper that will be sent to family and friends.<br />A great bargin. If support and durability are as good as the camera seems to be I will be carrying the C3000Z instead of film cameras.","This camera has all the features of a 35mm SLR + the ease and convenience of digital photography. Every aspect is 5 star. All the other reviewers seem happy with various functions however they all seem to focus on the lens cap grinding thing. Hey! get the extension tube and put a UV filter on it and get on with life! Forget the lens cap, dust and all the other stuff, it's a [dollar amount] fix.","All I can say is WOW!  After arming myself with a considerable amount of research, and the knowledge that my budget was not limitless, I chose the C-3000.  It's now about 45 days later and I'm still amazed by the quality.  Is the camera perfect? Of course not.  Nothing is.  But when you combine the amazing quality of the images, the camera's small size, the great features and (the) low price ... this was a no-brainer.","I searched all over the Web, and in stores before I bought my Olympus C3000Z.  I can tell you from experience you can look everywhere, but for a great price from a reliable source, just stop here and buy from Amazon. I am a professional photographer who wanted a digital camera for last minute headshots, web use, and to become more knowledgeable about digital photography.  I knew that Olympus made excellent digital cameras, so I narrowed my search on their brand.  I also knew I wanted 3.3 Megapixles.<br />I have hade mine for a about a month now, and I'm very pleased. Through a combination of an Olympus accesory cable ( the FLCB04 ) and some wiring of my own ( I'm a techie at heart ) I have used my C3000 with my studio strobes, and also a Nikon SB series flash, with excellent results.  I love the instant feedback, and not worrying about how much film I'm using.  I know I have only scratched the surface of this cameras capabilities.  I do suggest if you buy one that you buy the biggest Smartmedia card you can afford,  I plan on getting a 128MB, and that you also buy 2 sets of NIMH batteries and a charger.  This camera like all digital cameras will just chew through normal alkeline cells if you use the LCD display for any length of time.  When I went to the Photo East Show in NYC this past November, the Olympus rep told me that this camera would not Sync with Studio flash.  Well I can tell you Yes it does.  I will warn you, you need to use a flash with a low sync voltage or use a Radio slave to protect the sync circuits in the camera, but it does work.  For me it has been like discovering Photography all over again.  You can do things you just can't do with a normal film camera such as change the speed ( ISO ) for each frame if you want to.  Switch on the fly from color, to Sepia, to B&W, and best of all, see right then and there if you got the shot you were after.  My only complaints are 1) the shutter lag that is part of all sub $2000 digital cameras, and the time it take to write the file to the card if you shoot in Hi-Res TIFF format.  But this is a (...) camera, next year I'll go for the E20.  In closing for the amount of money I spent, I have no regrets.","I purchased this camera about a month ago, and I couldn't be more pleased.  It took all of about 10 minutes to get it up and running including installation of the software.  One caution about the software is that it won't work on an upgrade of Windows 95 to Windows 98.  It will work just fine if you upgraded to 98 SE.  I would recommend a higher capacity memory card; the 8MB is not really useable for much.  The lens cap, as many other users have reported, is a pain.  The best thing about the whole unit is that it is so user friendly.  I am truly an amateur photgrapher, and in no time, I was taking great pictures.  The menus are easy to understand, and you can quickly make adjustments.  By customizing the set-up, you can save some battery life.","This is a great camera.  Quality when printed on 8x10 photo paper has fooled professional photographers I've shown them to without them really studying the print.  Exceptional sharpness and capable in low light situations without a flash or elapsed time shots.  Remote allows shots only when camera is facing you and only has utility if you are trying to get yourself into the photo.  30 second movies are fairly high quality, but just a bonus as few would buy the camera for that feature.  Have taken close to 10,000 images with the camera and would replace it with a similar Olympus model if it did finally crap out.  Have owned over 10 digital cameras through the last 3 years used for personal and business applications.  This camera is the same as the 3030 with half of the buffer memory, but can still fire shots nearly as quickly as you wish.  It's withstood several drops while in a case without damage and has performed well.","I love my camera.  I started with a fugi camera and it was fine but a battery hog.  If you get the right accessories to go with this camera, you can't go wrong.","I've had this camera for about a week now. It takes great pictures and is very easy to use -  even the menus which you will get familiar with upon regular use. Get an extra Smartmedia card because they only give you an 8mb card with the camera. Also, get a battery recharger (Rayovac's 1-hour recharger works great with their 1600NiMH batteries and for me, they have charged in less than an hour!). The reason I gave this great camera four-stars is because of the lens cap. If you forget to remove the lens-cap when you turn the camera on, you will hear an ugly noise that reminds you to take it off and you HAVE TO remove the lens cap. Also, the lens cap is not attached to the camera itself upon removal so you run the risk of losing it (I have misplaced mine about three times now. Luckily I have found it each time!). Aside from the lens cap issue, I think this is a fantastic camera to welcome an individual to the \"filmless\"  world. I have always wanted to take-up photography as a hobby (I am a beginner) but the cost of film and development always stopped me. With this cool camera (plus an HP Photosmart 1215 printer which I have) I have broken that barrier. Enjoy!","Great camera, and the pictures are amazing, but it is tough to downlaod pictures unless you have USB...","I've been taking pictures for over 20 years... 35mm, APS, and now the Olympus C-3000 represents my first foray into digital photography.  Let me tell you... I'm impressed.  Don't let the compact exterior fool you.  This tiny package has many features packed inside.  The quality (on screen and printed) is superb!  I recommend the C-3000 without hesitation.","It can go from being a simple to use P&S to a feature loaded manual camera. Great picture quality and very easy to use with your computer/ TV. The only negatives are the lens cap and card size.<br />Go on...buy it...","The Olympus c3000 zoom is a beautiful camera.  It is easy to use, has wonderful picture clarity potential, an average optical and digital zoom.  With the 3x optical zoom and the 2.5x digital zoom (which there are plenty of mega-pixels to support) You have a combined 5.5 zoom capability, more than eneough for the average person. If you use a good photo-quality printer, such as the hp photo series you will be extremely well pleased with quality of your pictures.  Does have the drawback of only coming with a 8mb smartmedia card, but the prices of memory cards are dropping weekly, and you should be able to get a 128mb card for as low as 89.99. By far the best digital camera for the price in my opinion.  It is a pleasure to take pictures with this camera and see the instant results it produces. Thank you.","After substantial research, I chose the Oympus C-3000 digital camera.  I have owned other Oympus (35mm) cameras, so I knew that the optics and mechanics were of high quality.  The C-3000 did not disappoint.  The pictures are incredible; both the resolution and the color depth are superb.  The automatic mode is probably all that most people would ever use.  The camera is a gem, although I agree with the other reviewers that the lens cap is a problem.  I have owned the camera for three months, and I now use it exclusively, leaving my other (more expensive) 35mm cameras in their cases.","I can not add much to the reviews that are already written, all I can say is this camera is great for both point and shoot and to learn more advanced things about photography.<br />And it works with Windows XP no problem.","This camera is superb. The photo reproduction is very good, even using 640x480 setting, pictures were still very clear .<br />The controls are very simple and the menu is logaical and easy to follow.<br />The physical configuration of the camera allows easy operation even one handed.<br />The Olympus C-3000Z provides all the manual functionality for the avid experienced photographer while still being simple enough in auto mode for the beginner to use.<br />This camera needs to be shipped with at least a 16mb smart media card, the supplied 8mb card is simply ridiculous.<br />Anyone buying this camera must consider 1)rechargeable batteries and charger 2) larger SmartMedia card 3) Camera Bag 4) AC adapter.<br />Software compatability information  needs to be very clear as this camera will not work with an upgrade from Win 95 to Win 98.  A full installation of the software is necessary.<br />The silly little lens cap needs to equiped with a tether or very soon this will be a lost item<br />I would recommend this camera as very good value for money","After literally days of research (reading reviews and specs) while looking for a digital camera in Toronto, the C-3000 has truly won my heart, and I'm sure I speak for many who bought this camera.<br />As I've been an active amateur photographer for 20+ years, I really appreciate the versatility the C-3000 comes with and yet it allows me to fully engage my shooting with manual settings like using my SLR. It is a great piece of gem as an upgrade replacement to my older point-and-shoot digital camera that I bought years ago and now I always carry it around with my SLR. Many good things about this camera have been said here and so I try to be concise.<br />For less than $..., you get:<br />1. Great optics and resolution: 8 elements in 6 groups, aspherical lens equivalent to 32-96mm zoom lens on 35mm camera, f2.8-11; 3.3 megapixel CCD producing image resolution up to 2048 x 1536 (Olympus always has excellent optics and image reproduction)<br />2. 1.8\" LCD display and optical viewfinder<br />3. Macro mode for close-up shooting, minimum range: 0.8\"<br />4. Supports Panoramic feature (w/ Olympus SmartMedia only)<br />5. Supports full program, aperature priority and shutter priority auto exposure as well as manual exposure; auto exposure bracketing; spot metering; exposure compensation<br />6. Allows manual focusing<br />7. Able to capture QuickTime movie (15fps) with sound<br />8. IR remote control<br />9. aluminum casting!<br />A few features that I wish it had:<br />1. a faster lens ... like f2.0 in the C-2040 or the f1.8 in C-3040<br />2. a larger memory buffer to allow a faster shooting sequence and a longer movie capture time<br />3. a bigger memory card! the 8MB card that it comes with is nowhere near sufficient!<br />4. a more standard lens diameter ... the 43mm threaded lens mount (w/ the CLA-1 adapter) is such an odd size! and you can't put a filter right on the CLA-1 adapter because the lens tube will hit the filter when the camera is powered up!<br />5. a better design: the extended lens with a step-up ring and filter will obstruct the object from the viewfinder!","I was in the process of researching digital cameras, when I very unexpectedly got this one for Christmas.  I haven't been disappointed--it is a terrific camera!<br />The controls are wonderfully logical, and are not plagued by cryptic ideographs.  The range of creative control will impress anyone with even a modest background in photography.  The C-3000 lets you go from no-brainer point-and-shoot mode to complete exposure, metering, focus and flash control and back to dummy mode in seconds.  Even better, you can customize the default settings, letting you have the exact baseline settings you want immediately following power on.<br />But the real gems are the Olympus optics and CCD.  I have made dozens of absolutely gorgeous 8x10 and even a few 11x14 prints that are nearly indistinguishable from high quality 35mm prints.<br />Why only four stars?  Because my only serious gripe is the batteries, specifically if you're forced to use anything other than lithums.  I've tried both nickel metal hydride rechargeable and standard alkalines, and it drains them both very quickly.  However, you will conserve a lot of power if you make your default flash setting \"off\", so that you're not charging the flash every time you power on.  Additionally, the Olympus lithium battery packs are very hard to find, but I've found that Energizer AA photo lithiums work just as well, and are often cheaper.<br />As someone with a serious amateur interest in photography for nearly 20 years, I realized recently that the C-3000 has become my primary camera for everything from quick party snaps to that once-in-a-lifetime shot of sunrise on Mt. Fuji.  Meanwhile, both my 35mm P&S and my Nikon SLR rig are collecting dust.  This camera is an excellent value:  beautiful pictures, easy to use, excellent creative control, and very rugged aluminum construction, a big plus over other manufacturers like Sony.<br />Bottom line:  this is a great camera, and the C-3000 is the best value in the C-30X0 product line.  The only camera I'd recommend instead is the C-4040, which gets you the 4 megapixel CCD, but if you rarely make prints bigger than 8x10.","I have tried various brands and models  and no camera comes close.  The camera (Canon and Sony) takes crystal clear pictures, both indoors and outdoors.  Takes excellent pictures in low light.  The automatic mode should be just fine for the average person. I get photo quality prints from my HP 932C Desk Jet and when I utilize Ofoto.com.","I purchased this C3000 on July 24, 2001. I started taking pictures immediately. It is small and compact and all the buttons are laid out in a manner that one can understand. I place my photos on the internet and find that with the included 8 mb card it will take 24 beautiful photographs in the \"SQ1\" opton in jpeg format. In the \"SQ2\" mode, it will take 81 photos in jpeg format with your 8 mb card. The photos are as sharp and clear of any I have ever seen. If you use the C3000 for prints, you will need a minimum of a 64 to a 128 mg card because of the needed space. The camera now comes with a nice \"Olympus\" lens cap. One should use chargeable batteries and a battery charger for this camera. The C3000 does not come with a carrying case but the photos you get will more than make up for the small investment required in a case. In short, I highly recommend this wonderful camera.","I purchased this camera a little over a month ago.  Its a great camera, very easy to use. The picture quality is incredible. The only negative thing I have to say about the camera has to do with the lens cap: first, it doesn't like to stay on and 2) you have to remove it before you turn the camera on because the the lens extends on power up.  If you forget, the camera makes this terrible noise.","I have now purchased three of the C-3000's.  I use them daily as an insurance adjuster.  They were my first entry into digital, and I'm very glad I purchased them.  Of course, I purchased one, tried it, and purchased more.  The camera is very easy to use in the \"automatic\" mode.  However, the camera has many advanced features, probably more than the average user would normally use.  I've experienced minor difficulties in downloading directly from the camera to the PC.  I solved the problem with a smartmedia card reader, connected directly to the PC.  Results have been very good to outstanding.  Try this fine camera and you'll certainly love it.","I could stop looking for a new digital camera for a while.  This camera is GREAT for its price!<br />*lots of cool functions to play with, including my fav. sepia movie recording mode...sooo cool *can record movie in quicktime format (*mov) for up to 2 mins! *super HIGH resolution, best quality picture...you don't need anything better than this (don't be picky :) *comes with a cool little remote control, hehehe...love it! *not as small as Canon or Sony (selected models) but pretty compact!<br />** though it doesn't say \"compatible with 128mb sm-card but I've been using it with my 128mb smartmedia card with NO problem at all.  **<br />The only bad thing about this camera is the lens cap.  Must be careful where you put it when you take it out...","Take great pictures and impressive movies.  I've found it doesn't consume battery life as much as my previous cameras.  Lots of features to play with, thick manual booklet!<br />Hate the len cap, have to be very careful about it or I'd definitely lose it.<br />Inexpensive for what it gives...worth my money :) happy happy","I'm a photo enthusiast, but I am not a professional.  Just love taking and sharing photos and being creative. This camera satisfies my love of cutting-edge technology combined with my unrelenting desire to capture the moment on film.  I've had it for about 3 weeks and I've already taken, downloaded, cropped, framed, printed and shared over 150 good quality photos.  I'm not a technical wizard, but it's just as easy to use as my point and shoot, but the end product is far better.","The Olympus C-3000 (now priced ...) is a wonderful buy. In its league it is by far the best digital camera. Its  got a resolution of 3.34 MP. Other camera's with the same resolution cost a lot more. This camera is easy to use, and prints wonderful pictures. I had an HP C315 xi and I was disappointed because the pictures looked grainy but  not in this one, the pics in this one are better than a  film camera. This camera also does MPEG movies with sound. I love that feature.<br />It has pretty decent LCD. Watch out though, though ! If you buy this camera from not a reputed store, you might find a couple of dead pixels on your LCD screen. Buy it from a reputed store such as AMAZON or (...)so that you get value for your money.<br />This camera comes with the cables that let you connect it to your television and view a slide show of all the pictures. It does not come with a carrying case. It comes with a remote control that allows you to be part of all the pictures you are taking (which is a good thing !).<br />You can connect this camera to your USB port of your computer (make sure you've got a USB port in your pc and you've got Windows 95 b, otherwise this may not work for you.<br />It comes with the Camedia Software which although not the best, will do okay.<br />I recommend buying a memory card of atleast 64 MB. (Try (website) for a cheap card). This helps a lot. The card that comes with the computer is only 8 MB. You'll run out of this easily.<br />There are other cameras which are very expensive and I do not recommend those. I think this camera is simply wonderful. One more thing, you will definitely need rechargeable NiMH batteries and a recharger, the batteries provided run out sooooooo easily.","This is my very first digital camera however I did much research and homework before buying to get the most for my money.  Aside from the fact that it got great reviews, I have to honestly say this camera takes fantastic photos and is easy to use especially for a dummy like me.  A few minor quirks.  Lens cap will not stay on and easy to get lost.  8meg smartcard comes with the camera and is a total waste of time.  I would recommend no less that 32megs and I bought a 64 and it will hold 84 photos in the HQ mode.  The LED viewer on the back of the camera has no cover and can be stratched quite easily.  However, these minor flaws aside, I have been very pleased the ease and the quality this camera has given me.  I recommend it if you got the 6 bills to put out for it.","I found my lens cap after it had been on the lamb for three days. I agree that the lens cap is definately the only drawback to this powerful camera.  I wonder how much damage is done when you leave the cap on when you turn it on.  I am looking forward to purchasing the lens filter and adapter kit that comes with the AC  adapter that \"A Customer from Weston, CT\" referred to, as soon as I find it.  Haven't been able to locate such an accessory package yet. This camera is as close to an SLR in a digital camera that I can afford.  Just to be able to add lens filters, telephoto and wide angle lenses is very rare in this price range of digital cameras. The Olympus Smartmedia card priority to be able to use the Panarama mode is a little disappointing, but am very satisfied with all of the other features of this piece of equipment.","I bought a Kodak DCxxx - ...and did not like the picture quality (bad focus / unreal colors)<br />Returned it, and bought this puppy. It brings out excellent pictures. Got some photos developed ... online, and the results were amazing. I have never seen such clear photos with a regular film camera.<br />It captures details very well, focus very well, and color reproduction (contrast/brighness very good.)<br />Downsides: - Have to be very careful holding it. - The lens cap is not attached to the camera, so can loose it. - Quicktime movies - time lag between video and audio. - The lens comes out - even in the picture preview mode. Dont know why ?? - For very close shots, what u see in the view finder is not what you get in the picture - so might have to use the lcd screen to preview. - Add extra cost for rechargable cells. The ones that come with it will not last very long (about 150 shots). - Extra cost for camera cover - which is a must - because this puppy seems fragile.","I have had the opportunity to use various digital camera, ranging from Kodak, Epson, and Nikon, and the Olympus C-2500; they all seemed to work fine for the money but when I saw this one I knew we had a winner.  I love the size of it and the textured grip, it really feels secure in your hand.  The huge variety of resolution modes is more than you will ever need but is a great assest.  The only way this camera could be improved is if it was a SLR and lose the digital zoom (it only causes distortion anyway, something I hated about the Kodaks I tried).  You may find the cameras that take the 3 1/2\" floppy disks convenient but when it comes to quality you better get the olympus!  (if you don't have USB support, win 98 or newer, get a 3 1/2\" smart media adapter.  It is a little slow but at least you can download your images on anyones computer.)","This was my first digital camera purchase, in fact, this was my first camera purchase, period.  Although I did much research, I wasn't sure if an absolute beginner like me would be able to use the camera well. After a few months with the camera, I can tell you that I could not be happier.  When set to 'point and shoot', the camera makes me look like I know what I'm doing.  The picture quality is excellent.  I'm  also starting to get into the advanced features, and the manual settings allow a great deal of flexibility.<br />On another note, I did have to send the camera in for repair (the problem may have even been my fault).  I was going on a trip in a couple of weeks, and desperately wanted the camera for it, but I didn't think there was any way they could get it back to me.  Well, I'm happy to say they got it back to me in less than 2 weeks, in time for my trip.  Thanks Olympus!<br />My only quibbles are the lens cap (not attached) and the tiny 8 MB card that comes with the camera.  You will want at least a 32 MB card for seriuos photo excursions.<br />Buy the camera. you won't be disappointed!","I bought this one from Ritz camera...just before a 2 week trip to the UK.  I also invested in a larger (64 MB) memory card and a PCMCIA card reader adapter so I could download to my PC.<br />Great picture quality!  Unbelievable depth of field.  Movie feature is cute, but obviously no substitute for a video camera.<br />I would have given this 5 stars but for a few small, nagging things that were troublesome during running around the UK:<br />-  the stock memory card (8 MB) is stupidly small.  16MB is the absolute minimum that should be offered.  My new 64 MB card held 80 pictures at the HQ setting, and these pictures turned out very nice.<br />-  though the camera is small when looking at it from the front, it is pudgy in the thickness direction.  This makes taking it out of your pocket and/or the carry case difficult and frustrating.<br />-  as with others, I found the lens cap to be plain dumb.  A little plastic, clip-on thing that gets knocked off really easily when removing the camera from the case, and gets lost in your pocket between pictures.  Some sort of a built-in cap would be SO much nicer.<br />-  if you forget to take the cap off before you turn it on, even to download pictures, the telescoping lens gets trapped and probably grinds and slips gears.  I did this a couple of times, and I hope I didn't damage the mechanism<br />-  the LCD on the back of the camera is nice, but gets scratched when the camera swings back and forth when you have it slung around your neck.  The plastic covering the LCD is so soft that the plastic buttons on my shirt left little scratches!<br />Don't get me wrong, I love this camera and would buy it again.  But the above items seem easy to improve and make this a 5 star device.","after reviewing and following exactly the instruction of the review \"Windows ME - Read this before you panic!\", December 14, 2000, to install my camera with my new Micron computer 1GB Window ME, I cannot make the camera work with my computer and Camedia Master version 2. I am still trying for three days, but I am getting tired now. This C-3000 Olympus has been working well with my old computer window 98 and Camedia Master software. I would like to know if anyone else has experienced the same and know how to fix it. Please email at hongnhungblossom@yahoo.com.  Thanks a lots. Blossom","As a pro photographer, its a great second for test shots. Its fast and reliable, but I have found one drawback, that being the lens cover. The cover pops off by itself frequently inside my bag, exposing the lens to who knows what's in the bag at the time.<br />The option to use a 3.5 floppy would be nice as well.  Shooting at resolutions that I shoot at will fill a card very quickly ( I get about 4 shots).  Unless you are near a computer to upload, you're stuck and the shoot is over.","I had a very hard time deciding on just what digital camera I was going to buy.  Should I get a 2.x megapixel cam  or should I spend a few extra bucks to get the C-3000 zoom, which happens to be the lowest priced 3.3 with the features that this camera has.  Well, obviously I chose the C-3000 and I could not have made a better decision.  All of the features and extras are just the beginning of this cameras greatness.  I was absolutely stunned by the incredible quality of the pictures that this camera produces.  With a good printer and some photo paper, you won't even notice the difference between homemade pictures and professionally developed film pictures.  Even large 8 X 10 pictures are crystal clear with this cam.  When you first use this cam, you may be confused by the many options you have, but after a day or two of playing around and reading the instruction book, you will be able to make the most out of every photo.  If you are one of those people who absolutely hate auto focus, don't worry.  It has it.  It also allows you to control aperture and shutter speed, allowing you to leave the shutter open for a full 16 seconds, allowing you to create amazing effects.  By the second night I had the cam, I produced a neat looking picture of a car with the appearance of the lights tailing behind it thanks to the control you have of shutter speed and flashing.  If you just want simplicity, the C-3000 can do that too.  If you are not into being in control of your photos, just point and click.  If you do not like your photo, you can immediately view and delete it to avoid wasted space.  I can't even estimate how much film I have lost because of bad pictures that I wish I could take back.  If scenery is your thing, then you will love the panoramic feature.  With the aid of a tripod, you can make full 360 degree panoramics.  You take each part of the panoramic individually with the aid of the veiwfinder, and the computer software will combine the pictures allowing you to create a true panoramic, not the fake kind found in Advanced Photo System cameras.  If taking a panoramic seems to complicated for you, then just switch it over to movie mode.  Depending on the memory you have, you can record anywhere from 30 second to 10 minute video clips, all with sound.  If I were to continue listing all of the features, my hands would fall off from typing too much.  Whether you are an avid photographer looking for complete control of every shot or a person looking for a simple digital cam that takes great pictures, this cam is perfect for you.  There is one question about this camera that I do not feel that I could answer.  What can't the C-3000 do???","Fell in love with this camera from the start.  Simple to use once you read the instructions. If you don't read the instructions it isn't so simple to use.  Takes great pictures, the quality is awesome.  Easy to download if you have a newer PC with USB ports otherwise I suggest you purchase a floppy disk adapter.","My grandfather just bought the 3000 model...it takes wonderful shots of our pygmy goats on the run...I think the photos are clearer than his very expensive Nikon 35mm....and close ups are sensational. This camera is very easy to use and carry...we take it with us when we go snowmobiling..We bought a 32 mb card to go with it as the 8mb card is a bit limiting, especially if you want to take movies with it.  Great camera.","BEWARE!! On the outside of the box and in the advertising it says the camera is compatible with Windows 95/98/2000.  When you look inside the owners manual it says that it is not compatible with Windows 95, nor Windows 95 that has been upgraded to Windows 98. It must be a fully installed 98 or 2000 program, not just an upgrade.  We called the company and this was verified.  We have the correct ports on our computer, just not the correct program.  Now we are deciding if it is worth installing a new computer system just to use a camera!","Loads of functionality with plenty of options from fully automatic (a snap to use) to completely manual (impossible to use for all but the experts).  Takes sharp pictures but you will need plenty of memory to hold them; don't bother with anything less than 32mb.  I only get about 12 shots using alkaline batteries, rechargable NiMH last far longer.  My only complaint is the 1-2 second delay between the time that I push the shoot button to when the picture actually get taken.  Makes timing fast action shots troublesome.","I bought this camera in the Christmas Sale (£540) I also managed to get tham to provide 32 mb card free of charge.<br />It snowed shortly after I got the camera giving me opportunity to try winter shots.....I was absolutely gobsmacked by the results....resolution even in HQ mode brilliant....I even had one of the pics printed to 12\"x 10\" with no loss of quality. The facility to overide all the automatic settings makes it a photographers camera. My niggles....the camedia software took some fiddling with to set up.....and that blooming lens cap.<br />These aside I love my camera....I've even sold my cherished Nikon FE SLR...as I know I would never use it again","All the features seem a bit overwhelming at first but with a little patience and help from the easy to use manuel it truely is a breeze.  This camera makes picture taking a snap.  Very high quality pictures.  Just make sure to purchase additional flash memory.  You will need it if you plan on taking high quality pictures.","I recieved this camera as a Christmas gift, as many may have.  So far this camera has amazed me.  This is my first digital camera (not a bad way to start).  The picture quality is great, now I will have to upgrade my printer to get the most out of my images.  The panoramic mode is awesome.  Just shoot the picuters and let the software mend them together.  Also the RCA jack to hook up to a TV is also very handy to display your pictures to your friends.  The menu drivin modes is very easy to use, however don't leave home without the instruction manual, you will probaly need it to get the most out of the feature and relying on your memory may not cut it.  The downsides are minimal.  The lens cap thing that others have written about is true, hang on to that thing.  It has a little trouble working in a cold environment.  Get a battery charger!  The 8mb card is not enough, I would recommend a 32mb.  Plan on spending a couple hundred more in accesories. Overall I love the idea of saying goodbye to film and developing time and costs.  The USB downloads very quickly but use the AC adaptor when doing this, the batteries will thank you.","I shopped for months trying to find the right digital camera. This is it. The Olympus C3000 is simply the best camera with the most features for the price. It remains compact (similar cameras from other manufacturers are bulky in comparison), is loaded with features, and is easy to use.<br />I use this camera for web page images, printable family photos, and for more artistic shots. I even use it to record remarkably high quality Quicktime movies for my web site (with sound!).<br />You will be snapping photos minutes after opening the box, and with a little practice you will master the advanced features of this camera.<br />Be sure to buy a 32 or 64 MB card with it, though. The 8MB card that comes standard is too small for much of anything.<br />And be sure to keep track of the lens cap. For some reason Olympus decided not to tether the thing to the housing.","I have been very pleased with my C-3000 since I bought it in October.  Its images are very sharp and the colors are very good compared to other cameras I have used.<br />The only complaints that I have are:<br />- Battery Life Is Pretty Bad<br />- The included 8MB Smart Media card is way too small.  It was a bad idea to package this camera with anything smaller than a 32MB card.<br />It is my third Olympus Digital Camera since 1996, (The others were the D-200L and the D-400Z.), and I suspect that it will not be my last Olympus.","After having a great time with a cheaper digital camera - a Sony DSC-S30 1.3 Megapixel - I decided to trade up to one of the 3+ megapixel cameras.  I did extensive research comparing the top cameras, read countless reviews on photo websites, consumer reviews, etc.  The other cameras that I was seriously considering was the coolpix 990 and the Sony DSC-S70.  I finally decided on the C3000 because it was such a bargain.  If you want to have the flexibility of being creative with your photography, the C3000 has almost as much as the 990.  It has manual, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Manual focus, and exposure bracketing to name a few.  But it takes damn nice auto-exposure pictures as well.  You get a rapid fire mode, which, though not blazingly fast, is still respectable and even increases quite a bit with focus set to manual.  Another great feature lets you annotate pictures with a 4-second audio clip, kind of an audio labeling.  There other cameras out there, notably the Cannon Powershot G1, which has more features including one I really would have loved - a flexible LCD which is invaluable for taking candid shots.  But the G1 has image problems(Chromatic Aberations and noise), as does the 990(redeye).  All these cameras have plusses and minuses, but with one of the top-rated images and top-rated feature-set with a price that's a couple hundred lower than most of the top cameras, the C3000 really stands out!","Another reviewer wrote: \"\"Warning to Windows ME users  November 6, 2000  I have not used this camera, rather the D360L. However, when I upgraded to Windows ME (to take advantage of \"My Pictures\" and the built-in digital camera stuff), my camera wouldn't work. It wasn't in the driver list, so I contacted Olympus.<br />This was my response (read - \"doesn't work - we're not doing anything abount it\")\"\"<br />My answer for Windows ME Users:  DO NOT ATTACH THE CAMERA TO THE USB PORT UNTIL YOU INSTALL THE SOFTWARE. After the software has been installed, shut down the computer and connect the camera.  Turn the camera on to the \"display Pictures\" setting and then start up the computer.  Windows will detect new hardware and attempt to install the driver.  Choose the Windows 2000 Professional driver (Not Windows 98).  Once the driver has been installed, each time the camera is connected and turned on the system communicates just fine through the Camedia program.  Enjoy. I received one of these cameras on Dec 8th and WHAT A CAMERA.  Pics are sharp and clear plus very easy to use.  After reading all the way through the 200 page manual I realized that I learned enough in the basic functions section to let the camera handle most situations automatically.","I have not used this camera, rather the D360L.

After filling a 64 megabyte chip with vacation pictures, was very apprehensive when downloading to my computer since I had not tried my camera before the trip (which could have been disasterous!).  All that worrying in vain!  Each picture looked better than the last.  The resolution is so good I was able to zoom in to the smallest part of a picture and clearly see as well as if I had used a high power lens.  Second most important to the high quality pictures is how easy the camera is to use.  One read through the manual and I was on my way--with absolutely no problems!  And, it is so small, I am able to pack it in a little case and slip into my purse. 5 Stars is not enough!","We love this camera!  We bought it about 2 weeks ago and are having so much fun.  We bought a Kodak 4800 first and had terrible results with the quality of picture.  Very grainy and blurry.  The C3000 camera is sharp and crisp.  It is easy to use and is a lot of fun.  It is great to be able to take pictures, download them, save them, and start over again.  Our 5 year old loves to take pictures with it so much that we are going to look into getting him a less expensive one for Christmas.  I strongly recommend this camera.  Have fun!","This is a nice camera. It is just the right size - very small, but not too small to be hard to handle. The pictures we have taken with look great, both on printed photos (local printer and through online service) and on screen.  Given that the camera was not cheap, I was a little dissapointed that I then had to dish out more money on the following: -memory card - it only comes with 8 MB, you probably want at least 32 MB  -rechargable batteries and a charger -better editing software than comes with camera -cable for serial port (only an issue if you don't have USB, but you really need USB or the pictures take forever to download).","Before I saw this family of cameras in action, I didn't have an interest in digital photography.  The company I worked for bought a C-3030 and I was called over to set it up.  As I worked with it, I became more and more impressed.  The USB connection is blazingly fast (assuming you're using Win95/98/2000), the LCD is sharp and bright, and the processing of the pictures themselves is very fast.  Then I actually looked at a picture taken at 2048x1536 and my jaw dropped.  Using just the defaults for white balance, ISO, shutter, etc., the picture it took of a hedge of flowers was amazing.  Both the C-3030 and C-3000 have outstanding picture quality due to the well-designed Olympus optics and let you manually set just about everything for that perfect picture.<br /> I searched around and bought a C-3000 because the greater onboard memory buffer of the C-3030 wasn't all that important to me, I didn't need Photoshop LE, and I was going to buy a 64 MB card for it anyway.  The $200 you save, in my opinion, makes this a much better buy than the C-3030.<br /> One photography magazine labeled the C-3030 \"the camera for nerds\" due to all the options you can set.  If you're into it, this camera will let you explore photography as an art form.  I'm still learning what I can do with it, but it's already produced some beautiful photos.<br /> One recommendation I have is to buy a CD burner.  Photo albums on CD save a mess of hard drive space and are a great way to permanently store pictures and then show them off to friends.<br /> Finally, there is one feature that I don't see mentioned much elsewhere.  In the panorama mode, if you take pictures in a complete 360, the Camedia software lets you create Quicktime VR movies out of them.  This lets you truly express the feeling of being at a place.  I did one at Lambeau Field and you do feel like you're in the crowd when viewing it.","Incredibly versatile with superb pictures and excellent controls for real photo bugs who want to do manual overrides using aperture or speed prioritization.  USB transfer is very fast.<br />Only two criticisms: The lens cap is very easily dislodged.  I have spent an inordinate amount of time looking for it with several close calls!  Also you can't put a filter directly on the lens to protect it.  This is the most expensive camera I've ever bought and the only one I can't protect with a filter.<br />There is an answer:  Olympus makes a kit that contains a lens cap retainer and filter + adapter.  It also contains a number of other things I had already bought (very good rechargeable batteries, a case, AC adapter).  It costs $200.  You can't buy the lens cap retainer or filter/holder separately!","I just recently bought this camera and it's our first digital camera. i'm  very impressed with the quality of the photos. i have scanned photos from  my cannon 35 slr and the pics from the olympus are as good or better in  quality. the detail and clarity , color of the pictures are amazing! the  money was a bit much by the time you get some neeeded accesories. i bought  the 64 meg smartmedia, and the usb reader writer, and a battery charger,  not the olympus brand though, the energizer was half the price. the manual  is nice and detailed and all works as advertised! overall you will be very  happy with it!!","i got this camera just yesterday and love it. its very easy to learn what all those little letters and numbers mean if you just glance throgh the manual a couple times. you will definatly need 64 mb of memory. but its  kinda silly, some of the options. why would you want to attach sound to a  tiff file? i had been looking at some other colse competitors like the  fujifilm finepix 4700 and sony DSC-S70. but the fujifilm couldnt take tiff  files but could very esaly fit in your pocket while the sony can take  tiff(i think) but its huge! this camera can almost fit in your pocket(tight  fit) but it definatly has the goods. dont go with the nikkon series theyer  not that great and for get the cannon s10 mabye the s20 (also 3.3  megapixle) but it cant take movies for the same price. this is defenatly  the way to go but you cant store squat with anything lower that 16mb you  can get a 32 card from amazon for a good price. it has full SLR opptions  and you can leave the shutter open for at least 20 sec. appature from f2.8  till (i think) f11 very cool. the batteries it comes with last about 5-6  hours and arent rechageable. get the recgaable battery pack (your  init till the end.)  Its worth EVERY SINGLE PENNEY and comeing from a 13 year old thats  a lata cash.  this camera is very  stylish and shopisticated for the year 2000 get it. enter a contest and get  your money back.<br />  the best of luck!","I love this stylish design. I can firmly hold it when shooting pictures  and it feels pretty good. The advanced features are awesome. The only  problem is the USB port cannot support my Win95 PC system. In short, this  is my first digital camera and it meets all my demand.","Hello to whomsoever reads this!  I just got possession of a C3000.  It was  a replacement for my older model.  What a beast! I usually use a Canon AE1  SLR and this camera looks that for flexibility it'll beat it pants down! My  only gripe is not with the camera but the fact that I didn't get the remote  control - maybe that just doesn;t happen in the UK.  I got it from Wallace  Heaton in Bond street (the Queens camera provider, no less). And I can;t  use USB on my PC as I'm Win95 and the docs say that you have to have Win98  at least - so downloading an 8 mb card takes20 mins! I locethee video  ability and the sound track! The trouble is that the s/ware Olympus provide  is not too good - it seems a bit slow and lack the facilities from earlier  s/ware (v2,1) whereby you could set up the camera and preview in real tine  on your PC and also one could delete the film from a pc dropdown menu  instead of having to use the camera it's self to nuke the smartcard. I;ve  had this thing for 6 hours and I love it - I'll get some magic moments!  Thank you for your indulgence in reading - please reply to my email address  - dave@entropy.freewire.co.uk","I've had the C3000 for a month now and couldn't be happier (unless they supplied a useful size memory card). You need to get at least 32 meg of memory if you can't have a computer around all the time. Important note:  the panarama feature is really great but only works with olympus memory. Go  figure. It takes great ambient light photos and the flash is easy to  control, allowing you to moderate the amount of flash. The only drawback I  can think of is it cannot focus much closer than eight inches. The Nikon  990 has it beat there. The takes pictures faster than most cameras that I  tried and boots up pretty quickly.<br />The lens cap knocks off easily so get  one of those lens cap tethers. This camera is super easy and takes an  outstanding picture in the default mode but do yourself a favor and read  the manual. This is one powerful pup. Also rechargable LiMH batteries are a  must. You can fill a 32 meg card easily on one charge. If the price of the  3030 had been as low as it is now I would have sprung for the difference.  Hey, don't waste you time with low res cameras. I recommend this one. You  can't go wrong.","I bought my first digital camera about five years ago, and I pay $400 for it, and it was good by that time but not better than a 35mm film camera, the resolution was pretty bad, the size of the pictures too small and just 1Mb of internal memory. I decided to buy a new one so I checked a lot of  reviews about this camera. That you can see  at . . .<br />and  other reviews of different cameras and my conclusion is that the Nikon  Coolpix 990 is the one that takes the most beautiful pictures, has the best  and amazing macro ability and excellent manual white balance. But the flash  is the worst of all the digital cameras of this quality I have seen, has no  audio ability and no remote control. The picture quality of the Nikon  coolpix 990 is just very but very slight better than the olympus 3000, the  white balance of the olympus 3000 can not be set up manually but is  incredibly accurate, the macro mode is fair and good and my olympus 3000  has a very good flash with red eye control, audio ability, one of the best  things the remote control and of course the price that is lower than  the nikon not including the price of the bulky external flash that would be  needed that is more. So for me this was the best buy and if you  compare it with the olympus 3030 is also better because the only difference  is the software included that I already have, 16MB smartmedia card I  already have a 64MB one of my MP3 player and a feature that nobody uses  much the 32MB of internal memory buffer that let you take longer mov  movies.<br />The pictures that I have taken with this camera are amazing a lot  better than a 35 mm camera, the detail is incredible and if you have a very  good printer you would enjoy the best pictures ever, It is so easy to use  that everybody can be a professional, you can see the results immediately  and if you do not like what you see just erase the picture, change the  settings and take another picture. So there is nowhere else to go, this is  the camera If you want to ask me something just write me an email to  elcambur@yahoo.com","This is my first digital camera, but it is awesome.  I was a little concerned about the price tag, but it is well worth it.  Only concern was the Lithium batteries included, died after three weeks, bummer!  Would  definitely recommend NiMH batteries.","I bought this camera before going on a family trip to Alaska and was able to take some really amazing crystal clear pictures of glaciers, cravasses and mountains.  This camera is absolutely incredible.<br />* Be sure you have  a USB port in your computer before getting this, as this is the only way to  connect this camera to your computer---which is much much faster than a  serial port connection.<br />* The software comes with Quicktime so that any  \"movies\" you take with your camera can be .mov files---they come  out great, awesome sound.<br />* There's a 3x zoom which works great...plus  2.5x digital zoom which zooms much further but might sacrifice a little bit  of quality--great to know that one has this option<br />* pretty compact and  looks like a normal camera instead of other bigger, hunkier digital camera  models.<br />* shutter speeds from 16 sec. to 1/800 sec.<br />* 1.8\" wide  LCD monitor in the back for auto viewing<br />* remote control<br />Overall, this  is a really great camera if you're willing to spend the money.  Considering  how much of a photo freak I am, it's worth it.","Takes good pictures with good color.  3.3 meg is maybe slightly better than the 2.2 meg on the c2020.  Forget about using regular AA batteries, they will conk out in 2 minutes with the improved but apparently current  hogging lcd. The lithium batteries work fine (but expensive). A little  delay between clicking the shutter and getting a picture.  Overall very  happy with the camera, despite its not being cheap.","I'm the last kid on the block to get a digital camera, and I'm glad I waited. Easy to use, takes great pictures. I was going to get the C2020 but they didn't have one in the store. The lady told me take the C3000 and if I  didn't like it I could bring it  back and get the C2020. The price  difference is justifiable once you start pricing USB SmartMedia readers for  the cards, the C3030 comes with a USB connector to hook directly to your  computer. It's not going back to the store :)","this camera is one of the best olympus cameras i have ever seen!  I used to own one of their first cameras the 320L it was a great camera then and this is an even better camera now!  Im so excited to see what Olympus has  done over the past years. i would recommend this product to anyone that can  afford it!","Bought this the day it came out. Awsome, crystal clear images, tons of features, latest technology. I was going to buy the 3030 but I was told that this one was the exact same thing but having only 8MB smart media  instead of 16MB, lower grade of software and a slower speed. It's well  worth $200 to downgrade to this one unless you really need the Adobe 5.5  editing software.."]},{"name":"Agfa ePhoto CL18","amazon_reviews":["We got this camera for my 11 yr. old for his birthday.

I got what I expected.  An inexpensive, low end digital camera.  The pictures seem to be a bit better than those taken with a 110 camera.  Prints at 3X5 done on an HP952C look great.  It's not as hard on batteries as some have said.  Perhaps if you use the flash a lot, maybe it would be.  I've taken over seventy low compression pictures so far and the battery meter still says full.  The flash is probably the weakest feature.  Kind of a desperation option.  In house pictures under regular light look great.  Just keep the camera still.  What's new about that.  The download TWAIN driver transfers 16 low compression files to PC in about 10 seconds.<br />I'm happy with it.  Someday I'll want more quality and features, but this camera is a good start.","I bought this camera because i wanted to take pictures of friends and stuff to e-mail to people or stick on a web page. i think the quality of the pictures are very good and the overall package is worth the money. The only real downsides are the battery life seems to be poor and the flash is a bit strong and tends to be too bright which causes pictures to be washed out. The problems people have mentioned with blurry images must be due to them not having a steady hand because i have taken about 100 photo's so far and only a dozen or so have been so poor that i deleted them straight away. Blurry images from digi cameras is always a problem and i don't think it is too bad considering the price of the camera. Software was easy to install, don't know how good it is because i use Paintshop pro 7 to edit pictures, but it is standard corel paint package. Definitely rate this camera quite high due to dual purpose camera and webcam, fast pic download using USB and stores enough pictures to make it fun to use. A good all round budget camera.","I recently tried several digitals one being a Sony with all the bells and whistles you'd want but in comparing its photos, allowing for the same pixels, the little Agfa morethan measured up to it.  It is small, easy to use and has a great package with it.  Connecting to my computer was a breeze and even easier to my TV.  Yes it does have shortcomings but used in the way is should it is a great little & inexpensive camera to carry around in your pocket!","I LOVE this camera, and have been singing its praise to all my friends!  For it's price ... it is unbeatable.  The picture quality is excellent (and compares to scanned images from my Olympus 35mm), it is so easy to use (32 photos load in 2 seconds and the Corel Photo House software is fun & easy to use), photos can be seen on tv, battery life is excellent.  For my priorities (price, ease of use, quality) to mainly e-mail friends & post photos on the web, it is perfect. ... However, if you try to take a close-up indoors, I've notices that the faces can get over-exposed (which the software can't fix).<br />Some people have commented on the blurriness if the camera is moved, but this happens with expensive digitals, too.  My experience is with a $1,000+ Sony at work, and, IMO, they are equally sensitive to movement at the time the shutter is clicked & just after (and, in my non-expert opinion, on screen quality isn't that much different - I can't vouch for the print quality of either product, since we don't use the Sony for prints, and I wouldn't use the Afga for prints).  But, this one is MUCH more compact & easier to use (and less than 1 tenth the cost).  The only comparible product I have seen is the JamCam (which looks more durable, the Afga seems kind of delicate), but I don't know how their photo quality compares.","... The pircture quality turned out pretty nice and clear, you just have to keep your hands still for 5-10 seconds after pushing the button(it takes even longer if using flash). But overall it was not as awful as some other reviewers described. Holds up to 32 pix and you can review them on television. Small, elegant, user friendly. This camera is good for taking still images for your websites or for personal fun. ...END","Most valuable as a pocket-sized light weight snap-shot camera that allows you to pass images round the globe that night.  When travelling, its convenient to delete unwanted pictures each night by reviewing on your hotel TV (choose NTSC or PAL for US or EU TVs).  On a recent trip I achieved 22 \"high quality\" photos which provided a great instant record.  Indoor flash range is limited - still useful for reasonably close-up work, but can be confused by a bright light behind the subject, and doesn't work well as a fill-in flash, so don't expect wonderous results. Overall: excellent VFM.","The resolution on this camera isn't very good, and it takes a good 7 seconds to take the picture.  So you have sit there forever.","I have learned that it seems that this camera takes better pictures when in broad daylight.  I've taken pictures in the house and the pictures come out very dark. I'm still trying to get used to not moving the camera so much after shooting.","This camera is kind of neat since it can record both video and still pictures.  However, I found that whenever I take still pictures if the subject is moving or I am moving even a little bit the image is blurred.  In order to get a good image you must hold the camera steady for at least 3-5 seconds after taking the picture.  So, If I had the option I would save my money and wait for about six months.  There is bound to be something better right around the corner.","I wanted a digital camera that was under $150.  I decided to buy the Agfa CL-18.  I have since noticed that there are little spots in my pictures that are some kind of defect.  Cleaning the lens does nothing to remove them.  Another thing I noticed is that when taking pictures indoors sometimes the colors are not accurate.  You also have to be careful when using the flash indoors because it is very easy to under or overexpose.  There is also a large lag in between taking pictures that could bother someone who wants to take several pictures in a roll.  However, the software is very easy to use, and the camera is very small and does not take too much battery power.  Buy this if you want to take small, informal pictures for email and small pictures, or if you want a child or teenager to have something to play with.  But if you have any desire to take a high-quality picture, and want to edit it, then use your film camera and a scanner.","I have been wanting my own digital camera for quite some time. My family had a JoyCam digital camera, but the quality on that was so low that it was not worth it to take pictures. Plus, I went to college and it stayed with them in a different state. So, for my birthday in December, I requested a digital camera.<br />I didn't want anything extravagant, just an affordable camera that took good-quality, pictures I could upload to my homepage.  That is exactly what I got with this camera. I have had the camera for a few weeks now, and I think it is a great one. This camera is so small and cute; it is pocket-sized so it's easy to take it anywhere and not have it be a big hastle. It can hold 16 high quality pictures or 32 lower-quality ones (Although I have not been able to see much of a difference in quality, both of them are very clear.) It uploads quickly via USB, and the software that comes with it is helpful and fun. The camera is easy to use; its buttons can be figured out right away, and just in case you need help, the instructions are very helpful.<br />I have one nitpicky complaint about this camera, and that is that you have to wait seven seconds in between snapping pictures. That is not usually a big deal for me, because I am not extremely impatient, nor am I a professional photographer who has to click a whole bunch of different pictures after one another. :) So I feel that for the average person this is not a big complaint, but if you plan to take lots of pictures in a row, I just wanted to mention that with this camera you can't do that because it pauses for 7 seconds after taking each picture to process it, and you can't take another picture until those 7 seconds are over.<br />If you are looking for a *great* digital camera on a limited budget, I definitely recommend this one. It has met all my needs for my webpage and has also been a fun toy to play with as well. :) It will provide lots of fun at your family and friend gatherings. I love not having to buy film and wait for it to be developed, but instead being able to take pictures and have them within minutes on my computer anytime I want. This camera has served those needs very easily, and I have a feeling it will continue to do so for a long time.<br />DETAILS: Ease of Use: Excellent; operates with the touch of a button Durability: Good; solid it will last until new technology develops Photo Quality: Good; suitable for enlargements in all light conditions Battery Life: Good; lasts 200-300 exposures Recommend to other potential buyers? Yes","I've been using this camera for three days,I primarily bought it for e-mailing fotos to friends,and for this application it's great,simple to use and down load to PC,what a bonus the USB connection is on such an inexpensive unit!...the camera is almost to small for my big hands,I've been using the tri-pod attachment for a better grip,however it's not really necessary.<br />You really can't go wrong with this camera.","I have owned this little camera since June 2000. I have an excellent SLR system for slides and a very good point and shoot camera for prints so was interested in a digital camera that was small light simple and could be put in a pocket when I'm riding my motor cycle, out in the sports car or just walking around.<br /> The resolution is adequate for point and shoot pictures, nothing can get damaged, my 4 yr old  Granddaughter can use it easily, as can any one else who has used it.<br />  Down loading is very quick and easy, I very seldom modify any pictures, resizing if anything.  About 1400 photos have been taken<br />  Best quality photos are head & shoulder pict. inside in fairly even light. The flash is ok just read up on it's range.<br /> Outside landscapes lack detail, low pixel count doesn't help. Easy on batteries ,I use nicad recharables and carrry an extra 2.<br />Check out some photos at [...]","I received this camera as a birthday present from my boyfriend.  I didn't even know I wanted a digital camera until I recieved this one.  I enjoyed taking pictures, but since I am not very good at photography many of my shots didn't turn out and it was a really expensive screw up.  I've had the camera for 5 days and have had so much fun with it.  It can take up to 32 pictures on standard quality or 16 on high quality. (I've not really noticed a difference between the 2, but I've never printed one either.)  Now everyday I take a \"roll\" of pictures and at the end of the day I look at all of them.  I found this camera useful in many ways.  For one, it is simple to use.  Two, it has multiple uses: camera, web cam and you can view images on your TV or computer.  Three, it is cheap...for what it does compared to all other cameras it is definately a best buy...after rebates you can find this camera as low as $100!  What a good gift idea!  Fourth, it is quite small so you can take it where ever you go...perfect for teenagers!","I bought one to experiment with digital photography.  It takses very good pictures, and I was able to get good results under a variety of conditions using supplementary 3rd-party lenses.<br />But I have a Macintosh, so I have to use a friend's PC to download the pictures.  It seems that, since Mac has USB as a standard interface, these fine folks ought to support Mac AT LEAST to the extent of transferring the pictures to the Mac's hard drive in some format the camera already supports.<br />How about placing a driver download on your website, AGFA?!","After reviewing digital cameras for days and returning one that wouldn't upload to my computer, I was really pleased with this camera. This is under a megapixel and the pictures look great on the computer. I can't believe they came out so nice. It's perfect for my needs which are to email to my children every so often. It worked so nice that I might get one for my daugter so she can send me pictures too.","After reading several reviews and doing some extensive researh on several  entry level digital cameras I finally purchased this camera yesterday. And  contrary to some of the reviews posted on the NET, the image quality is  excellent, it just takes some work to get your photos to come out properly.  For example, if you are taking a photo in a dark setting, turn on the flash  and it will come with good results. Also, make sure you keep your hands  still when you are taking your uor they will come out blurry. Furthermore,  make sure you are standing an appropriate distance from the image you are  shooting. All in all, the quality of the pictures I have took is above par  and are comparable to the higher end cameras at more than half the price.  Ir just takes some work, but isn't that where half the fun is? One  complaint is that the video software is..Well..It stinks..Not only does it  not provide audio for your videos, but the streaming video comes out VERY  blurry. Not a big thing for me, since it's hard to find any1 to video  conference with and I do already have a QuickCam Express which is more than  satisfactory. All in all, I was pleased with my purchase of this camera and  my images came out better than I thought they would.. Oh, a couple of other  ti[s for you guys that are thinking about buying this camera. If you wanna  delete your old images, just click on the record/play button at the back of  the camera and press the shutter button on the image you want to delete.  Simple. And if you want to delete all your old images, simply click on the  play button and then the flash/timer button until you see the word ALL on  the right hand side of the LCD screen, then press the shutter  button.Again..Simple...Another thing...When taking pictures remember to  wait for the green light to stop blinking before you move around..The image  doesn't get processed until the light stops blinking. All this is explained  in the manual so make sure to read it..That is all. This camera is worth  the purchase and to all of you that did not find it satisfactory. Perhaps  your expectations were too high?The software that comes with this camera is  also pretty good. Nothing spectacular compared to Paintshop pro 7 and  Photoshop which I own, but decent nonetheless .The USB connection also  makes d/ing images to your comp a snap. Just plug in your cam, goto Corel  PhotoHouse and follow the instructions on the manual. That's all there is  to it!...","This camera was the best camera for the money I could find. USB connection  gave me faster downloads easier connections and POWERS the camera!(Big  saver of batteries) I also found it easy to do video conferencing with the  supplied software and the web page microsoft's Netmeeting. I don't think  there is another camera that offers both of these features."]},{"name":"Olympus D-460 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["Good for the money-not extravagant.","Liked how easy the camera was, my only complaint was at the end of our trip the special lithium batteries DIED.

Ultimately after the camera broke I searched for a replacement, but unfortunately Olympus never followed up with anything as good. Since then I moved on to Canon, Panasonic and Nikon cameras. I briefly went returned to Olympus for the 790 series. While I liked the rugged features, the limited photo options and poor image quality didn't impress me.

I have a friend that has an Olympus C-5050 and viewed some of his photos that were taken.  The rich color and detail compared to my old camera can be easily seen.  The time when digital pictures will meet or exceed the detail on 35mm is almost here!  I bought this old camera for 2.5X the price it is today so that goes to show what 3 years can do to prices.  But the picture you want to take probably won't wait that long.  I would recommend the Olympus line of cameras to anyone!  They are a strong performer and reliable too!  Take a look at [...] (requires subscription) and see for yourself!  My old camera had beer spilled on it and it still takes the best of photos today.  For those that want it all check out the new \"E-1\" model that will soon hit the market.  Its bound to set the standard in digital cameras.","I purchased my Olympus 460Z after the birth of our first grand child over 2 years ago.  It was very easy to use from the start.

Our youngest daughter just recently got married and it was so much fun to make thank you cards and be able to have their wedding picture on the front.  I also did this with her graduation thank you cards.  Everyone loved getting a picture.  I have made business cards for my dad using pictures of his tow trucks as the background.  I have thoroughly enjoyed all the photos I have taken.  To me the quality of the photos are great.

But I carry it with me most always, use recharchable batteries, upgraded to higher smartmedia storage cards, and bought a basic USB card reader (mounted to my computer with velcro) to upload my pics. It's fast and the software is easy to use. This camera is a good buy/value and I will be using it for many more years to come.","I take it everywhere.

We just learned how to transfer images to a VHS tape and really like this option.  We come home from our trips anxious to transfer the images and relive each event.  We normally upload our images to a web site that will print copies of the photos for us, so we never have to deal with the hassel of going some place to get prints made.  We would recommend this camera to those out there who are just getting into the \"digital\" age.","I liked my Olympus D-460 zoom digital camera so much that I recommended it to 2 sons and bought it for another son as a gift.  I get great action shots of the grandchildren and border collies in our lives, and stunning, color-perfect close-ups of flowers--dew drops, insects, and all.  It is compact and light enough to pop in my purse or jeans pocket, and the cover control makes that a safe way to go.","This is my first digital camera.  I have had it and used it extensively since August of 2001.  Sharp pictures, good color.  Downloads are slow - perhaps this is a digital camera characteristic - I don't know.  I bought a larger storage card for it and it works really well.  I am buying a replacement and hope to find something that works as well with the movie and sound feature.  No reservations in recommending this camera.","This is my first digital camera. I have been using this camera for nearly 5 months. The quality of prints I get are fantastic for a 1.2 megapixel camera. I am able to get prints up to 5x7 with good color tones if the correct setting is chosen. I like that the flash is manual (it doesn't automatically pop up when it detects there isn't enough light) because it gives me a little more control. I have never had a problem with the lens cover hitting the lens when closing it. The lens cover basically is a \"two click\" close; one to activate the lens to swivel down into the base and then the next to complete the closing of the cover. The only thing I would improve this camera with is for Olympus to add more accessories in the kit. I had to go buy batteries, battery charger, larger memory card and a camera bag, which added up very quickly.","I originally owned an Olympus D-340 digital camera -- loved it! Then the tiny Canon digital camera came out.. so I sold the D-340 and bought the Canon digital camera. While it was nice and small, it didn't take the quality of pictures that the Olympus did, nor did it fit the hand right.  I sold the Canon digital camera and bought this one in January of 2001.  I also bought some rechargeable 2AA batteries at the same time and finally had to use them.  The batteries that come with the camera (lithium, I believe) JUST died this January (2002)!  I have taken hundreds of pictures with this camera! (Maybe thousands!)  Anyhow, the camera is designed to fit your hand. The size is about what a normal camera might be. If I had a bigger purse, it would probably fit.  I just bought a small digital camera bag for it. I can toss in the battery charger, etc. I like the quality of the zoom. The only thing that I don't care for is that the flash has to be flipped up in order to use it.  I guess this is good and bad.  Good because if you DON'T want to use flash for a picture, just don't flip it up (less having to do with settings, etc.). Bad, though, in case you forget to flip it up when you need the flash.  All in all, I will definitely stick with the Olympus brand for digital cameras.","This camera is a great buy! It's very easy to use and downloading pictures to the computer is even simpler. Great value for your money!","I am a newspaper columnist covering the environment, art, drama, book launchings etc. and so need a camera for close-ups, distance,reproducing paintings etc.For a newspaper columnist and senior citizen with no photographic know-how (I used to be assigned a photographer to accompany on assignments) this digital is invaluable, halving the work involved in getting my copy to the office.  Praise for my photographs from professional newspaper photographers, and requests for copies from the artistic community here are, in  my opinion, entirely due to the ease of use of this model. I use my camera every day,it has never yet let me down. I visited this site to check the latest price for my insurance because if I should lose it I wanted to know I could replace it straight away with another Olympus D460 Zoom.","I have had this camera for 1.5 years now.  It is very easy to use.  Easy menu allows one to explore various camera settings.  Really good at taking pictures close up in macro mode.  Suprisingly sharp pictures for 1.3 megapixels.  Great first digital camera.  Only downside is uses AA bateries really quick.  But I would buy this camera again.","I purchased this camera about 1 year ago- and now I don't even know where my 35mm camera is.  This takes terrific pictures (you see the results right away), and if you're not happy with the result, just erase and take another picture!  This camera is lightweight, and easily fits in a pocket or a fanny pack.  It does use a lot of battery power, so buy some rechargeable batteries with your purchase.  I have an old HP color Deskjet printer, and the photos I print are good enough to put in my albums at 5x7\" size, 8x11\" pictures print kind of grainy- but I don't use the high resolution setting on the camera.<br />The instruction manual is easy to navigate and simple to follow, I carry it with me on vacations to review how to take panoramic photos (these print beautifully!), or how to set the red-eye reduction.<br />One word of caution, always use the wrist-strap when handling the camera.  I dropped my camera once on vacation, photos taken after that were too dark to see.  I sent the camera back for service to Olympus, and they were fantastic!  I had the camera returned within 3 weeks, and I could track the progress of my repair online at the Olympus website.  If I ever feel the need for a new digital camera, it will definitely be an Olympus!","This camera is easy to use with many useful features. It has refreshed my interest in photography and has been much fun recording all kinds of events and sharing the images with friends. The supplied \"Camedia\" software allows for a little more than just basic editing and is similiarily easy to use.<br />I find the fold up flash inconvenient. I sometimes forget to place it in its armed position and miss an opportunity. The switch behind the sliding cover which retracts the lens and protects the camera would be better positioned to operate a bit sooner so you would not have to be so careful to avoid hitting the lens when closing the case.<br />The light weight and smooth compact design of the camera are real high points. When closed, it fits in a pocket or pouch without ever snagging on anything and is well protected. When open, the design allows for trouble free recording without fear of damaging delicate parts.","Pretty much point and shoot. Even had it used at my daughters wedding and it took better shots compared to 35mm Nikons FG. I'm happy with it and take it everywhere. For the price its hard to beat. I find the flash a little awkward but i'm getting use to it. Great starter digital! Definetly a good deal.","If you're wondering if you can use  digital camera, don't hesitate to buy this one!  It's easy to use, takes great pictures and if you buy a flash card, you won't have any trouble downloading the pictures and printing them out.  The pictures turn out perfect using my HP 930 series printer. It really helps to be able to see the picture before you take it. The size of the camera is nice, too. It's easy to carry.","This camera takes some pictures that are crisp and clear.  There are also several features that help it adapt to most situations.  It is essential that you buy some rechargeable batteries for it though.  I bought the Olympus Ni-MH rechargeables along with a charger and I can take over a hundred pictures on the high quality setting before a recharge is needed.  The only reason that I didn't give this camera 5 stars is because in some types of bright light, the pictures come out distorted.  However, I think this is due to me not figuring out all the features yet.  I needed a digital camera so I could send pics to friends and family over the internet and this one fits that purpose perfectly.  (...)Hope this review helps someone.","This is one of the best, for your money, digital cameras.  I have been very pleased with the overall performance of this camera.  You will never want to use a film camera again!  Knowing what your pictures look like while you can still retake them is great!  The LCD screen is usually enough to see what your picture will look like or you can view your pictures on the TV.  Included is a NTSC video output cable to plug the camera into the \"video in\" on your TV or VCR.  You really notice the excellent quality of the image that way, as well as a great way to share your pictures with everyone in the room. It comes with batteries, Mac/WIN serial cable, 8MB memory card, & software.  Everything you need to open the box and start clicking.<br />The instructions included are easy to follow.  The software is limited on the editing it will do, however I have found that I don't really want to edit most pictures, because they turn out fine.  The 8MB SmartMedia card included is adequate.  I purchased a 64MB card and don't regret it!  You can take around 730 pictures on SQ-high quality, 250 pictures on HQ and 150 pictures on SHQ.  More than enough for a trip where you aren't able to upload pictures to your computer and clear your memory card.<br />The downside, it eats batteries like all digital cameras.  Purchase the Olympus battery charger and TWO sets of batteries for it.  That way you are always covered with a spare set charged.  Remember your printer will determine the quality your prints are going to be.  A regular inkjet (like the Lexmark 3200) just doesn't have the quality that one like the HP Photosmart P1000 does.  I can print an 8x10 picture (SHQ) on the HP that is photo quality.<br />Pick up a camera case too because it doesn't come with one.<br />Hint: You really don't have to buy anything extra to make this a great purchase.  The rechargeable batteries, 64MB card, and camera case are not absolutely necessary to enjoy this camera.  Just stuff that I found after using it for a year makes it a little bit nicer.","I bought my Olympus D-460Z in May of 2001, so I've had it about six months.  I am crazy about this camera, and I have convinced at least three other people to buy it.<br />The D-460Z is lightweight, comes with a flash, digital and optical zoom, and optical and LCD viewfinders.  I generally use the LCD viewfinder because it's convenient.  The camera will take low-light shots without the flash, which has been a nice transition from the 35mm film cameras I've had in the past.  The zoom is also a very nice feature that I didn't have on my film cameras.<br />The camera uses SmartMedia storage cards, which can be bought at Wal-Mart and Target.  They're not very expensive.  The camera came with the 8mb SmartMedia card, which holds 36 images when the pictures are stored at the default size (about twice the size that I like to send in emails).  It also only comes with the serial port connector.  Many people feel that this is too slow, but I have no problems with it.  It probably takes 5-10 minutes to download 36 images from the camera.  You can purchase a SmartMedia card reader that connects via a USB port.  That is supposed to be faster, but I haven't found it necessary.<br />I have bought a few extra components for the camera.  It does not come with a case, but it fits normal 35mm camera cases fine.  I bought a 32mb SmartMedia storage card (holds about 144 images in default size) as well as a four-pack of NiMH batteries and a recharger.  The camera came with batteries that lasted quite a long time, but when they went out, it was nice to have the rechargeables.  The rechargeable batteries will last me about a weekend of picture-taking before requiring a night in the recharger.  The camera will use regular AA batteries, but you will have to change them at least once a day.<br />I have been very happy with this camera and I strongly urge others to purchase one as well.  I have found the software and the LCD control panel to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.","Being my first digital camera, maybe it's easy to wow me, but I really like this camera.  Picture quality is very nice, and the camera itself is easy to use.<br />My only gripe is the battery cover.  Because of where it is and the direction it slides (and the fact that the batteries are literally spring-loaded projectiles), it's really easy to bump or grab the camera so that the battery compartment springs open, spilling the batteries and requiring you to re-enter the time and date (if you do).  Many times I've pulled the camera out, only to fumble with getting the batteries back into it.<br />Other than that, I love it!  Oh, and I'd recommend getting a USB reader for the memory.  I didn't think that waiting for the serial download would be that big of a deal, but it gets irksome.  A larger memory card would be a long wait.","I purchased the Olympus D460 because my friends have had good luck with Olympus products.  Having an iMac with only USB ports was a concern, but an Entrega USB-to-Serial converter works just fine.  Downloads are a bit slow to the computer.  The battery life is amazing in these cameras, as long as you don't use the viewing screen much (normally it is off when you're taking photos using the manual viewfinder).  I've had this camera for over a month with the same set of orginal batteries.  At 122 photos in standard quality, I've taking hundreds of photos on one set.  I have purchased a AA battery charger and a few spare sets of NiMH AA batteries (from Batteries Plus).<br />The photo quality is amazing.  I've had some problems with the MACRO mode-- the image seems to want to be much higher than what I'm pointing at, but other than that, the camera is great.<br />Night photos only work with a tripod... and photos of bright objects at night (such as the Moon) really do not turn out well.  So this is pretty much a daylight or flash camera.<br />I'm not sure  you can even purchase this camera any more, but I prefer the optics to some of the newer models.<br />It also has a cord to  hook up to your TV-- we have watched some of my photo shoots on big screen TV's.. which is just great.<br />At ($) this camera is a fantastic deal.","I love my camera!  I upgraded from a $20 point-and-shoot film camera and my D-460 is easy to use but has many extra features that i can explore as well.  I am also pleased with it's compact size and durable exterior.","Took our new Olympus to Europe, over the Alps, through Italy.. what a wonderful experience.  Great pictures, easy to use. Downloads to the PC fast, has good editing software.  I used the 64mb chip to take lots of pictures, could review them as I went. I would recommend this camera to anyone.","A great digital camera, but with a size that is almost small enough to be stuffed in a pocket. Simplicity of operation makes this camera user friendly. It is kind to batteries and your pocketbook. The camera is loaded with digital features and options......but..<br />Best of all it produces excellent photos.<br />---------------Mike&Judy","This is my first digital camera.  The reason I chose this one, is because a friend of mine had a similar model and I found it very easy to use.  A very reasonable price for a camera! I went to 2 parties this weekend and took my photos, downloaded them and put them online.  It was very simple for the average computer user.  Now I can share my memories with everyone!","I just recieved my camera today and have taken about 50 pictures already!!  This is by far the best camera for the money.  The image quality and the resolution are crystal clear and with the optional San Disk reader downloads are quick and easy....","I have had more photo fun and taken more pictures since buying  this camera than during the rest of my life put together.  With no film to lose I can really make sure I like a picture by doing what the pro's do: take a lot of pictures and select the best ones.  I generally run the 460 at maximum resolution since it isn't particularly endowed in the pixel area.  The color rendition is excellent as well as the autoexposures.  Basically, if you can see it, it can photograph it.  Some of the night shots are quite impressive.<br />The 3X optical zoom is good.  I wouldn't have a digital camera without it.  The lens is prone to \"barrel distortion\" where straight line things like poles and trees at the edges of the frame appear to bend toward the center.  A little strategic framing can make that less of a problem.  The camera is rather slow when trying to do live action shots.  It takes about a second between button press and shutter release.  This is an eternity when trying to photograph my son doing a bike trick or catching a hawk on the wing.<br />Being an old SLR hobbyist, I miss my telephoto and my filters.  I miss an instant shutter release and other areas of total control. In fact, we're shopping for a replacement for our old Canon AT-1. An SLR digital camera with the capabilities of a film SLR is just  way too expensive for me right now.  So I will continue to have two cameras: my super fun and somewhat amazing D-460Z and my SLR. Each with its own strengths, each with its own creativity.","I received my Olympus D-460 Digital about 3 weeks ago, It has been very easy to figure out, I've taken dozens of pictures of my grand-daughters and all sorts of things, and they have all came out great, it was easy and fast to download onto my computer, easy to make adjustments to lighting and just all around great, what you see in the view finder is what you get a picture of. I also got the smartmedia floppy adptor to transfer the images to the computer, I think the batteries have held out real well and still going strong, but I did also get rechargable batteries.","I have had this camera for about 6 months now.  Have taken many pictures with it.  The lithium batteries that came with the camera lasted for a very long time.  I did not use the lcd display though.  If the lcd display is used you will see very short battery life.  I bought an optional ac adapter to save battery life when uploading pictures onto my computer.  I also bought a set of rechargeable NiMh batteries w/ a charger.  Both are a must!<br />I am a resolution freak, so this camera doesnt deliver the resolution quality I hoped for.  But then again, I am a very picky person and to the \"average\" person the quality is probably fine.  Most people that see the pictures I take comment on the great quality.<br />I have never printed any photos out yet since my printer is archaic and I know it wouldnt do a good job.  So I cant comment on this end of things.<br />I have had the camera in for service.  This was my fault though.  The camera took a pretty good beating on the back of my atv this spring.  Ended up costing me $108 to repair.  Quite a bit considering I paid $280 for the camera.  I found out the hard way that digital cameras are quite a bit more sensitive than your average 35 mm film camera!  And yes, I was pleased with Olympus service department.","No complaints, outstanding pictures.<br />Get yourself a 64mb memory card [price]will give you 256 picture capacity.<br />Also get rechargable Ni-MH batteries and charger (any brand).  Otherwise you will be buying lots of batteries.","I bought this camera at Xmas for my wife and have had alot of fun with the pictures.  I bought a HP 970cxi to print the pictures and am a little disappointed at the color quality.  It isn't bad but it ain't great either.  When I print from cds i get with my 35mm the quality is great so I feel fairly sure it is the resolution or something that is at fault.  I had a problem with the camera and had to send it in for repair.  It was back in 2 weeks which i thought was acceptable. NOt a bad camera for the price.  I paid more when i bought it last year(so what else is new)Go with higher resolution if you can afford it.","I think this was a damn good camera. Two cons- the battery liffe isn't too long, even with the batteries they give you, and the zoom isn't the greatest. I have never seen such good quality pictures ever- this is the best in its class! SO- if you want a camera get this one! ...","After some careful research, I decided the Olympus D-460 Zoom was the digital camera for me, and I wasn't disappointed!  This is my first attempt at digital photography, and I wanted a camera that would take pictures of excellent quality, but wasn't too complicated to use.  (I don't know much about manual settings for different situations and lighting, etc.)  I love the way you have a choice as to whether to just point and shoot, or to adjust things first.  The settings are so easy to understand and the menu so intuitive that even I can change the settings manually if need be.  I did purchase immediately the following accessories:  a USB reader, a 64 MB SmartMedia card, a battery charger and two sets of rechargeable batteries, and a case.  I considered these items \"must haves\" for the sake of speed and convenience.  I would recommend this camera without reservation to novices and experienced digital photographers alike.  The picture quality is amazing, and I've already had some prints made by Ofoto.com from pictures I've taken on this camera.  You would never guess that they weren't made from conventional film.  You can't go wrong at the price I paid for this camera!","I have owned this camera for about a year now. It takes excellent pictures and is well-suited for producing photo-quality prints. It writes the pictures to memory at a decent speed, and has a rapid sequential mode at the lowest resolution. There is a slight delay for autofocus when you take the picture, but if you depress the button halfway while you're setting up the shot, pressing the button the rest of the way will take the picture instantly (much the same as in many autofocus 35mm cameras).<br />Battery life with the included lithium batteries is excellent, but beware--they cost about [price]each (you need two). I have had a lot of success using rechargeable NiMH batteries; the battery life with NiMH is still decent, and it doesn't cost much more to get started with them than it does to buy a replacement lithium set.<br />Picture quality leaves nothing to be desired. You even have the option of taking pictures in a lossless format (TIFF as opposed to JPEG). This is great for pictures that you need to enlarge. Note, though, that one or two uncompressed pictures can fill up the average-sized memory card.<br />The special features work well and can be useful, although the default settings are good enough that the average point-and-shoot user will never need to change them. The lighting and macro features are particularly well-done; you can take close-up shots in macro mode that would typically require an SLR camera in the world of film.<br />The camera's weakest point is in its serial link. It works fine, but you can spend a long time waiting for the pictures to transfer to your computer. It would be wise to figure the cost of a USB smartmedia reader into the total price for the camera--with my Lexar reader, the images transfer in a matter of seconds.<br />I did a lot of research before buying this camera and can say that I was not in the least disappointed with the results. You would be hard-pressed to find a worthy competitor in this price range.","When I reviewed this camera back in February I was thrilled with its quality and functionality  but I was frustrated by the ordeal of getting my PC interface up and running.<br />Thanks to a few helpful people in the ... community I was able to fix the problem, ( I'll repeat the tip I got which was to deactivate any Palm synchronization routines - really easy to do)<br />I have been using the camera constantly since then. It was especially useful when our baby was born recently. We live in New York and have no familly here so I took a lot of pictures that were emailed to family and friends around the world. We received many compliments on the quality of the pictures.<br />So I am now very very happy with the camera and rate it 5 stars plus. It is simple to use and easy to pop into a small bag and carry around with you. In the past few months it has travelled with me constantly. Although I bought this camera for my wife I found that I also used it a lot...so I bought another one! My poor Nikon SLR system hasn't seen the light of day for months!<br />A great camera!","I bought my D-460 in Sept last year. I would have given it a 4-star rating then, but now it warrants only 3 stars from me. After 10 months of steady use, I can now point out its deficiencies:<br />1. The lack of USB connection which makes it horribly slow to download pictures. It can take up to 10 minutes to download a full card! I had to buy a SM card reader to save time, which meant more $$ required.<br />2. A very noticeable shutter lag, i.e. there is a delay of about .5 to .75 sec between the time you press the shutter release, and when the camera actually captures the shot. This camera is definitely not suitable for capturing \"the decisive moment\". If you've previously used an anolog SLR camera (like I did), this delay is unacceptable.<br />3. There is also noticeable barrel distortion from the lens. Basically it means the lens makes people look fat and straight lines bulge outwards. To be fair, this is a fairly common problem in consumer digicams, and you can fix the problem with good photo-editing software.<br />4. The \"guillotine\" lens cover. It is quite easy to bash the lens when trying to close the retractable lens cover. You're supposed to slide the cover forward SLIGHTLY (but not touch the lens), wait for the lens to completely retract into the camera, then slide the cover completely shut. Whose bright idea was that?!<br />Don't get me wrong though. This camera still serves me well (I work for a newspaper). The D-460 has many plus points which others have covered previously, so I won't repeat them. But before you decide to buy it, consider the four drawbacks I mentioned above.","One of the best camerias that are super! I say buy it. Yes the amazon prediction is correct. a 4.5. HAve the cash than buy it","I have had this camera for about 4 months.  Starting out, I thought wow, this camera has everything: zoom, autofocus, flash, memory cards, the whole bit.  But somethings i've noticed about it sometimes get me to worrying about it. First of all, everytime you open the screen, it takes about 3 or 4 seconds for the zoom lens to pop in and/or out.  This is bad because it wastes the batteries if you keep doing it for taking different pictures. Next, when taking the picture, you push the button, and it takes about 1 second for the shutter to actually flash.  I think this is because of all the focusing and dithering. Also, you can use the viewfinder to see pictures once you take them.  But to review them, you have to completely close the lens, wait the 3 or 4 seconds, and then hit a button to turn on the screen and wait for the picture to load.  This is not absolutely horrible, but sometimes I am in a hurry. Biggest thing:  While taking the biggest quality picture.. the camera will take like an entire minute to load the picture to the disk.  This is horrible because in a minute, the thing you may be shooting will be gone, or the group of people will become antzy. The serial port is so slow, its like having a really slow internet download.  On the plus side, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  It has 2 sizes, the larger size has 3 quality options, and the smaller has 3.  The higher quality ones look quite nice.  Very clear, very good lighting.  Everyone always complains because the pictures are so clear, you can see every blemish. Overall, great camera, but sometimes the lengthiness of the operations can be a bit overcoming.","I had given that honor to the (now sold out) Kodak 280, but the Olympus is now the clear winner. Its classical, Stylus-like design is attractive and functional. It is well made, well-balanced in the hand, and has intuitive controls and menus. It features 'burst mode' shooting (great for sports events, etc), superior optics, a great 3x (plus 2x digital) zoom and USB transfer (though only a memory card reader will make you love the simplicity of digital cameras). The included 8 meg SmartMedia card will handle about 100 480 X 640 pics, and larger cards are easily found and reasonably priced. The 1.2 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for everything from emails to printing 5 x 7s. The flash, battery life and software are acceptable. The price is a real bargain and makes this the #1 mid level digital camera at this time.","This is one fantastic camera.  Very easy to use and the pictures come out great.  Love all the features it has to take pictures in any kind of light.  Took pictures of the Grand Coulee Dam at 10pm and no one could believe how beautiful it came out.  Easy to download the pictures with the software and adjust any photos you may want sharpened or adjust.  I would suggest buying a USB Reader/Writer to download faster though.  Very happy I purchased this camera and highly recommend it.","This is definitely an all in 1 solution for a digital camera. Featuring 1.3 MP it definitely gives real professional quality shots. Even in pitch darkness the camera with the flash gives amazing pictures. Further the panoramic feature is also wonderful. The only downside of this camera is the manual lens cover. Anyway this is a must buy for serious starters with digital camera !!","This is my first digital camera and I could not be happier.  I can't say enough about the camera's performance and the quality of the pictures.  This camera is great and the price was terrific.","I've owned a D-460Z for almost a year now and am very happy with it, the camera feels solid, the zoom works well, good battery life. This camera takes 1280x960 shots, plenty big enough for use on the web or printing 5x7 prints.<br />Has advanced features like adjustable ISO and Spot Metering, also has a panoramic mode.<br /> Quote from another reviewer<br />\"In order to view pictures you've already taken, you need to close the lens cover. This is slow because the zoom needs to retract. Similarly, to switch to photo mode from viewing mode, the camera needs to be reopened.\"<br />This statement isn't true, you dont have to close the lens cover, just simply press the button twice on the LCD display, will toggle it from shooting mode to viewing mode.<br />Only hole I can find in this camera is the serial connection. save yourself alot of time and buy a $50 USB smartmedia reader, can copy an 8mb card to your computer in seconds., I have the SanDisk ImageMate USB smartmedia reader, use it with my desktop and laptop.","This is an outstanding digital camera - you will not be dissapointed!<br />Strengths: *Excellent picture quality *Intuitive user interface and menus *Can use as point & shoot, or can tweak options like ISO and flash speed for more advanced use *Included Smart Card holds from 32-122 images<br />Weaknesses: *Serial port download of images is super-slow (although getting the USB smart card reader via rebate will solve that problem) *No AC adapter or rechargable batteries included","I have had my camera for about a week now and really enjoy it. The controls are pretty easy to use and once I read through the manual I had no trouble. It also included a set of NiMh rechargeable batteries and a charger in addition to the disposable batteries. That was a nice perk.<br />On the down side and the reason I did not give it a full five stars is: The front cover is a little awkward to use until you get used to it. Having to slide it partway closed, let the lense retract and the finish closing is a bit strange. The other thing and what I think is the most serious flaw is the serial cable connection. It is very slow. Olympus should have included either a USB connection instead or some kind of USB media reader or floppy adapter. I realize some people do not have a USB port which is probably why the serial connection is still in use.<br />All-in-all, the camera is a great value and high quality for the money. If you can afford the extra money, buy the D490Z instead. But again, this camera works great. The images are generally clear and in focus and the software does a great job of removing redeye and auto adjusting the brightness and contrast. Of course, like any camera, digital or film, there will be some bad shots. The plus is you can delete these and try again.","Did some research, and finally went with this Olympus D460.  It was up and running with no problem, very easy to use, great pictures.  One thing:  I did not find the flash very user friendly.  The first few times I could not remember how to use it.  You must physically pop it up, which is hard to remember after other cameras that have the flash ready to go at any time.  But surprise, it took good pictures, even without the flash, and after several tries I finally remembered I had to pop it up.  I love this camera, and look for any excuse to take a picture.  I have e-mailed pics all over and am probably driving people crazy, but that's OK.","I don't know much about digital cameras, but I just purchased the D460 Zoom and love it!!<br />First of all, since I don't know much about photography, I love how this camera does all the work for you, it tells you when you need to use flash, auto-focuses, etc.  It is very easy to use.  About 15 minutes after opening the box I already had a couple pictures taken and loaded onto my computer, this included software installation and everything!!  I love how you can see the pictures on the screen immediately after you take them, so you can see if they turned out or not.<br />Just to address a few of the problems that I read in other reviews.  One person commented on how you get drained on the batteries.  The simple solution is to buy some rechargable NiMH batteries with a charger.  The NiMH batteries last a long time to start with anyways!!<br />Another problem that was addressed is that it can be tedious to find your pictures on the camera if you go through them one by one.  There is a setting on the camera so that you can put 9 thumbnails of the pictures on your screen at the same time, so finding your pictures really is not a problem!!<br />I also recommend buying a USB Smartmedia Reader.  I believe I read that they are 80 times faster than using the connection provided with the camera.  Also, if you use the USB Smartmedia Reader, you do not need to waste the camera batteries while you load pics onto your computer, since the camera isn't even involved in the loading process if you use the USB Reader.<br />Also, just as a side note, a 16 or 32 MB smartmedia card is nice if you plan on using the high quality settings.<br />This really doesn't have to do with the camera, but if you plan on buying these extra add-ons, I really suggest using Ebay, you can get some great deals!!  I bought all the add-ons off from Ebay and spent about 100 dollars less than I would have elsewhere.<br />To sum it all up, I think this camera is an excellent choice whether you have no idea how to use a digital camera (such as myself) or are a pro!  The controls are extremely easy to figure out with a tad of help from the instruction manual.  Also, for such a simple and easy to use camera, it takes excellent, clear, crisp, pictures, which really surprised me when I first saw them!  I highly recommend this camera!!<br />The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is I think it should come standard with the USB reader, to save us consumers a little money.  Although not at all necessary, it still would be nice!!<br />I hope this helps you all out on your digital camera purchase!!","A USB smartmedia reader should be mandatory, not optional with this camera. If not, you'll waste too much time downloading images. For example, an 8MB clip full of  images (about 17 at Super High Quality mode) takes about 10 minutes to download via my PowerMac's serial port. Download times thru a PC serial port are about the same. Contrast this to about 20 seconds with a ZiO USB smartmedia reader.<br />I bought this camera about 6 months ago for ... from another vendor. And that was WITHOUT a card reader. ... current deal offers much better value.<br />Another flaw in this model is its \"guillotine\" sliding cover feature. While the design looks elegant, it's also quite easy to bash the lens with the sliding cover (you need to push the cover halfway to trigger the lens retraction into the body).<br />Also note that this camera doesn't come with an AC adapter (that's \"optional\"), so you'd also drain your batteries if you download pix via serial port. Did I mention that a USB smartmedia reader should be mandatory with this camera?<br />On the plus side, this camera does takes great pictures, has a wider aperture (f2.8) than most cameras in this range, and also a great panorama feature with stitching software. There's also exposure compensation and ISO selection (125, 250, 500).<br />I rate it a bit under 4 stars.","I received my Olympus as a gift almost a year ago and I must say that I use it EVERYDAY!  I'm not lying.  I love this camera.  It's extremely easy to use and takes great pictures.  I love that it has a quiet mode for when you don't want to have the beeps heard and that you can view the pictures after you taken them and delete them afterwards.  It have 3 different quality settings as well as film speed options.  The 8mb card is good if you're not taking over 200 photos a day.  Another plus is that there is a little notch underneath in order for it to sit on a tripod.  The software it comes with perfect for me to view my photos before I save them to my computer as well as for me to view any photos [digital or scanned in] before opening Photoshop.<br />There are only a few downsides that I've found.  One is that it eats batteries up like candy [I go through a 4 pack every 2 weeks] and that the serial download takes forever!!!<br />This camera is definately worth the money!  I love it!","I just purchased this camera , my first digital. It is very easy to use and a lot of fun. A USB reader makes it all come together, which you get for free from Olympus via a mail in rebate.The 1.8\" color LCD viewfinder is nice for taking a quick peek at the pics you just shot.So far I have only been using it as a point and shoot camera, but you can adjust the exposure to suit your needs as well as numerous other settings.The camera comes with the Olympus utility software,and photo manipulation software and it works Ok, but I can't wait to try Photoshop or paintshop pro with the Olympus.that will be awesome!Like I said, this is my first digital and I was a little nervous about spending $ on it, but I am very happy with the olympusD-460 zoom.","I spent several weeks searching for the perfect digital camera in my price range, and this camera came out best.  Not only does Amazon have it at an amazing price, but it takes wonderful photos that compare to those of other cameras that are twice as expensive.  I take photos for a website, and I have been recieving international recognition for them.  I credit a lot of my most recent success in photography to this camera, and I plan on sticking with Olympus for a long time.<br />If you're interested in getting your cameras onto your computer faster, I suggest purchasing a \"Smartmedia USB reader\".  The camera only comes with a serial hookup, which is quite slow.  A USB connection is about two hundred times faster.","I love the camera and if I ever get it to interface to my PC I will be thrilled. I have tried everything, ( including reading the instructions)I am fairly technology literate. I own two laptops (an IBM running NT and Dell running Win98) neither of them interface so if you have any tips please email me I have tried calling Olympus but lack the time or patience to sit on hold...so I am not happy....be warned","Just picked this little baby up today and I am very happy with the purchase.  I've read quite a bit of reviews, both here and elsewhere and I pretty much had it narrowed down to a few models but I'm glad I went with this one.  I've had good experiences with Olympus film cameras before and it seems their high quality transferred over to the digital scene as well.  Sure, it's only 1.3 Megapixels and it might be a bit pricy for one considering you can get a 2.0 Megapixel camera cheaper but, the user friendliness and the sheer number of features make this camera far superior to the higher megapixel cheaper models.<br />First off the pictures are crisp and clear and with the optical veiw finder available, you don't need to mess with the LCD screen and waste batteries.  The menu screen is easy to navigate (though a bit difficult to figure out the icons...) and this is truly where this camera shines.<br />Not only are you able to change the picture quality from standard 640 X 480 to uncompressed TIFFs, but you have to ability to adjust white balance, and more importantly, the ISO value!  You can also adjust the exposure compensations and, if you are using an Olympus memory card, you can do panorama shots as well.  Flipping through the pictures already in the card is a breeze, especially since you can use an idex view to see up to 16 shots at one time and deleting pictures is a snap.<br />Unfortunately this camera doesn't come with USB support (...wonder why???) but pick up a USB card reader along with the camera and the problem is solved.  I picked up a PNY USB Flash Card Reader for ... and it installed in a second and transfering 6 shots at one time to the HD was almost instantaneous.<br />If you're going on a long trip, you might want to either buy a bigger memory card and/or bring a pocket full of AA batteries but, for all intents and purposes, this is a great camera for us \"point and shoot\" types.  If you're looking for a good camera with excellent features for a great price, this is the one you want.","I did a lot of shopping around before buying this camera.  The ONLY flaw with it is that there is no USB connection, other than that I can't complain.  Visual quality is outstanding, and its the only camera in the price range that has the optical zoom.","Without a doubt, the D-460 Zoom is the finest 'Point & Shoot' camera I've ever owned, print or digital.  It's everything other reviewers (whom I read carefully before buying...) say and more.  Yea, compact size.  Yea, feature packed.  Yea, yea.  But those PICTURES!!! I've never seen such clarity!  Even in max zoom mode this camera continues to astonish me.  I've printed out pictures of my grandson on photo inkjet paper to pass out to friends and relatives, and they think I'm lying when I tell them it's an inkjet print from a digital camera.  I like that.<br />A lot.<br />True, you're going to NEED the optional AC adapter, but only for uploading to your computer.. standard alkaline batteries work just fine and last a long time for picture taking.  And I've seen the difference between the 460 and ANY of the Sony junk.. no comparison.  Olympus wins on picture quality hands-down.  No contest. That Macro feature for close-ups... what a hoot!  It's great! Professional quality! You gotta get this camera if you're thinking digital.  Really.","This camera's so easy to learn and use and the pictures are the best! I got it the day before the Inauguaration and had a ball with it. It was cold and rainy and the thing didn't miss a beat with only a coupla hours of learning. You can have it when you pry it from my cold dead hands.","This was my first digital camera and I'm very happy with it.  It has all the features and functions necessary to take quality pictures and enjoy them in digital fashion.  The camera is sturdy, lightweight, and easy to use.<br />I'm still working with the supplied software.  All in all it was easy to install and use, although I am puzzled by its inability to allow you to edit out things like red-eye.  I'm using another piece of software for that.<br />A couple of peeves:  Although its nice not to worry about a lense cap, the motorized sliding cover seems to inviting trouble in the long term.  Also, the LCD screen is excruciatingly slow when scrolling through previous pictures.  I haven't found a way to randomly access them on the camera, so you have to go through them one by one, which, when you have 30 or 40 stored up, is very tedious.<br />Overall, you could spend more and get some 'extra' features, but I doubt its worth it.  This is one of the best cameras for the price, which means you won't feel so bad when the next generation of cameras come out and you want one.","I've had my Olympus 460 Zoom since June, 2000.  It's the only digital camera I've owned and I really enjoy it.  It's been on several vacations and numerous holidays with us and I seem to learn something new about it each time I use it. Once you read the manual several times and figure out the menus, you get the hang of what settings will provide the best shot.  The Auto setting will cover most normal conditions, but special settings are required to get shots of things that are moving or have unusual lighting.  It's easy to experiment and just dispose of the bad shots.  Battery life is good, but I strongly advise two sets of rechargables to always be prepared.  The download of pictures through the provided serial cable can be slow, but just relax and have a cup of coffee.  I've used numerous Internet services to develop my digital pictures and the quality is as good as any 35mm.  The advantage here is that you get to always pick out a perfect picture.  I love it!","I do love this digital camera--it is easy to use and the size is unbeatable.  I bought my camera a few days ago and have already taken over one hundred photos.  Yes, it does take some time for the images to download, but it is teaching me patience.  My only complaint is the software, Camedia 1.2, that was sent with it.  Something happened with how it recorded the last file viewed and it kept crashing.  I had to wait all weekend to talk to the help desk and while they were able to easily help me fix the problem, it can and does reoccur.  There is a later version of Camedia, but they are only packaging it with their new model cameras and it is unavailable for purchase.  All in all, though, this camera is an excellent choice and I highly recommend it.","I've been a photographer for some time now and I have mainly used manual cameras, but I think now the time has come to add a digital camera to my array of photo equipment. I was pleased when I recieved my Olympus D460 camera it was everything I expected out of a digital camera. It has great zoom features, an easy to see lcd screen(indoors), easy to follow instruction manual and the 1.31 megapix is good enough quality to make my family ooh and ahh at the photos. However, there are a few drawbacks 1.31 megapix is only good up to 8x10 enlargements before it gets very grainy, you can't see the lcd screen in bright daylight ( this would hold true for any other camrea with an lcd as well ) While it comes with 8 megs of memory I bought a 32 mb upgrade so I could hold more than 32 photos. The serial interface for downloads is agonizingly slow, so you'll need a card reader as an accessory. Overall, its the best in its class if you have a budget under 400 dollars, if you're in to spending a bit more check out the D490 ( it boasts 2 megapix and better zoom features).","My Olympus 460 Zoom is a great little camera that features both ease of use for occasional snapshots and advanced capabilities for the more serious photographer.  It is my second digital camera, my first was a Fuji MX-1200, a really great little camera also.  The Olympus is not quite as easy to use as the Fuji but after my recent trip to China, I wanted something a little more capable than the Fuji.  Since I consider myself an \"advanced amateur\", I have been giving all the \"bells and whistles\" a workout since I got it.<br />I am particularly pleased with ability to spot meter for back lit situations, shoot \"burst mode\", the zoom, and the ability to select the \"ISO\" (film speed).  The exposures I get with the Olympus are also more accurate than the Fuji.  The Fuji tended to underexpose in all but bright sunlight, forcing me to do a lot of image adjusting in Photoshop.  The Olympus is generally \"right on\".  I also really like the software bundled with the Olympus.  I purchased a USB Smartmedia reader for the Fuji because I couldn't get the Fuji software to install under Windows 2000.  The Olympus software installed fine under Win2K and works really well.  It may even cut down the time I spend with Photoshop.<br />I really, really like the quality of the resulting images.  Olympus makes fine lenses and It's SHQ (Super High Quality) mode lets you take either uncompressed TIFF images as well as \"low compression\" JPEG's.  I have printed images suitable for framing on an HP2000 Cse and a Tektronix Phaser 850 up to 8 x 10.  They compare very favorably with images taken with my 35MM SLR and scanned on my Epson Perfection.<br />Finally, the highest praise I can give this camera is that I am giving serious consideration to leaving my assortment of cameras, lenses, motor drives, filters etc. home on my next trip.  Hope this helps.","This has all of the bells and wistles that I think that even an intermediate digital camera enthusiast would want.<br />The only thing that I found slightly annoying was shutting the camera down by closing the camera cover.  You have to close it slightly and pause while the lens retracts and everything powers down, then close it the rest of the way.<br />Otherwise I don't think I have found one thing that I don't like about it.<br />It took awhile to familiarize myself with all of the features but most everything works fine on automatic.  And you always have the ability to manually set everything about the camera - ISO, brightness, resolution, etc.<br />I've done some panoramas with this, as well as dark and inside photos (the latter two things my previous digital camera had no luck with).<br />I've also amazingly been able to take pictures of magazines articles and been able to easily read the text in the resulting pictures.  Don't ned my scanner anymore! ;)<br />The burst mode is a nice feature, though not strictly neccessary.  Macro works great and the digital zoom combined with the optical zoom is a great feature.  Can't live without it.<br />There are more features then I can list here, and will probably keep me experimenting with them for quite some time.","Read all the reviews about the D-460 when I received it as a present just recently. I was very happy with the camera overall except a few vital areas such as one reviewer had mentioned - battery load instructions in the manuel did not match up with the batteries that were included (cv-3), which only went in one way opposite of the manuel and was hoping for a USB port for easier download. It took excellent photos and was fairly easy to download with a little maneuvering into a port. I had taken alot of pictures over the weekend and laid the camera on my desk and now all of a sudden, NO POWER!?????? Got advice?","This camera is fantastic!  The images come out sharp and clear, it's packed with features such as 3 modes of picture sorting where you see 9 images 6 or 3, 3 zoom levels, very easy to use, auto lense cover.  I can't say enough good things about it.","This is my first digital camera, and I was truly astounded the first time I downloaded a picture and made it my Windows background on a 17\" monitor.  The detail and color is tremendous!  The camera is so easy to use; the only wish I have is that it wasn't so easy to forget the flash.  I frequently waste a picture because I forget to flip up the flash.  The macro feature is great, too.<br />I feel that the D460Z is a GREAT value!","This is my first digital camera. I am quite happy with it. I did get good technical support from Olympus. It would be perfect if the camera has USB port connection for its images download.","I received this little camera for Christmas.  It's my first digital camera.  I was impressed by it's size and features.  It takes great pictures.<br />The only down side is the serial connection to the PC.  I spent 3 days trying to connect this to my PC unsuccessfully.  The Olympus support wasn't very helpful.  They blamed the problem on my serial port.  I fooled with that for 3 days then finally I gave up and went out and bought the San Disk Image Mate smart media reader with USB.  It worked right out of the box and is very fast.<br />The camera is great, now that I got the pictures into my PC.  I took some night pictures outside without playing with any of the advanced settings and they came out pretty good.  Nice camera for the price.","If you are looking for a digital camera to begin with, this is it!  If you want a good camera t start with go out and buy this, NOW.  I received this as a Christmas present and I haven't put it down today yet.  I love it!","After spending several days researching digital cameras in this price range, I settled upon the Olympus D-460Z.  I am thrilled with my decision!  This camera is simple to use, right out of the box, and takes wonderful pictures!  I use the pictures primarily in an online magazine, but they also print out nicely! It has sufficient features for our business and personal needs and I highly recommend it to anyone considering a moderatly priced digital camera.","After several months of debating whether or not to buy a digital camera, I researched various models and bought the Olympus D460.  The zoom capability is great and the pictures are really sharp.<br />I was really concerned about battery life because I had heard that batteries get drained really quickly with digital cameras.  I've taken over 100 pictures using Rayovac rechargeable batteries and the battery meter is still on full.  I only use the LCD screen to display pictures I've taken.  I use the viewfinder when taking pictures.<br />The only negatives are that you have to manually lift the flash when taking flash pictures and that the camera does not use USB.  I was debating whether to buy an external USB reader when buying the camera, but the serial interface is sufficient for me for the time being.<br />Overall, I've been thrilled with the camera.","I just got my Olymbpus D460 from Amazon two days ago and I started playing with it last night.  I struggled a little with loading the batteries and all of the menu options, but once I got everything set up and working, everything was great.  If you haven't yet used a digital camera, you're going to love it.  It is great seeing the pictures right away and being able to delete the bad shots.  As far as this specific camera goes, you can't beat the price for the features.  I did a lot of comparison shopping - reading reviews, etc & I am convinced this is a great deal.  I especially like the option where it will take 4 pictures in a row very fast.  I got great action shots of my cats fighting that I would have never been able to take with a regular camera.  A word of advice that I heard from a techie friend:  Go out and buy the NiMH rechargeable batteries and recharge those before you get your camera.  Apparently the rechargeable batteries lose their power even when they are not being used (i.e.  in your camera bag), but the lithium batteries don't.  You should save the lithium batteries as backups in case you are stuck with dead rechargeables.","The 1.3M pixel Olympus D460 is my second digital camera.  I also have a 1 M pixel HP Photosmart C20.  The Olympus is by far the better camera.<br />The D460 is far easier to use (no need to read the manual), and the Olympus image transfer and editing software is much better than the HP software.<br />The D460 will take well over 100 photos on 4 AA batteries.  The C20 will only take about 10. And the C20 will not run on NiCd batteries.  I always use NiCd batteries in my D460.  I have taken over 170 photos on a single charge.<br />In all modes of operation, I have found that the D460 produces much better results than the C20.  I regularly print great looking 8x10s from my Olympus.<br />I have used both cameras for shooting close ups.  The Olympus works much better in macro mode.  I have even had very good luck using the flash in macro mode.  Using the macro mode in combination with the 3:1 optical zoom, I can take a full frame photo of a silver dollar.<br />I had great fun using the D460's panorama mode on a trip to the Grand Canyon.  The Olympus software automatically stiches multiple images into a single, very high resolution, panorama.<br />One word of caution:  Certain features, such a the panorama mode, are only supported when you use genuine Olympus smart media cards.  Don't buy \"compatible\" smart media cards even if they are gauranteed to be 100% compatible.<br />Like most digital cameras, the flash on the D460 is very close to the lense.  Consequently, red eye can be a problem.  The D460 is equipped with a red eye flash function which usually helps to prevent red eye.  Often, I still find that it necessary to remove red eye with the Olympus software that came with the camera.<br />If you plan to spend less than $400, I highly recommend the D460.","I just got this camera yesterday. It is my first digital camera. So far Its seems to be a good unit. I have found only two things to complain about; 1> - the included batteries can cause some confusion, if you follow the instruction manual, to load them. The battery polarity indicator diagram ,on the bottom of the camera, just doesn't match the polarity label on the included Olympus batteries (i.e. it looks like they load with polarity reversed..not a good thing). The manual has diagrams for loading individual AA batteries with polarity clearly indicated (which matches the diagram on the camera) but the diagram that illustrates loading the included battery packs has no polarity indicated!?!? The battery packs are 'Keyed' so you can only insert them one way. After arguing with myself over the conflicting info , I inserted the batteries, and the camera came up and works fine. Now I have to resolve this problem again when I use rechargeable individual NiMh batteries. Olympus really needs to rethink the instructions. I bet more than a few people have tried to use individual AA batteries , loaded them backwards and fried the camera. Tsk. Tsk. Major Oversight Olympus. I understand that the Olympus batteries are very expensive, perhaps Olympus concluded that a little dis-information could equal increased profits?? The Technically impaired may well resort to using only the Olympus brand in order to avoid problems??.  Compliaint #2 >It sure could use a USB port,but hey .... I guess you can't have everything. After a few minutes reading the instruction manual I was taking pictures and so far am very happy with the results.","This little camera is my first experience with digital photography and it is great.  It fitted in with my requirements, it was under $500, it has an optical zoom and a standard \"compact\" camera format.  I originally intended to use this as our \"quick shot\" camera, but is soon displaced my 35mm SLR.<br />Things I like.  The battery life is really good if you don't use the electronic view finder (I don't).  It can quickly take a shot and get it right, and the fill in flash works well.  The optical zoom and macro facilities are very useful.  The photo quality is very good.  I cannot pick the difference between my 35 mm. and the Olympus 460 on a standard 6 by 4 photograph<br />Things I don't like.  The serial down load to my PC is very slow; the standard 4 mb card is too small, the software for editing the photo's is pretty rudimentary and the lens retract can get tangled up in the front cover it your not careful.<br />You will need to buy a camera case for it and a larger memory card is pretty useful.  I do all my editing with a different software package.  Would I buy it again?.  You bet!!","This is the first digital camera that I owned.  I have read all the reviews on this web page before I decided to purchase one.  And was I glad that I did choose this one.  Quite a few people warned about the lid that cover the lense, they said that if you are not carefull, you could damage the lense.  But I found out that it was design so that the lid stop before the lense retract without touching the lense.  I tried about a hundred times to see if it rubbed against the lense, but fail to make the lid rub against or scratch it.  So my conclusion is that it was design with an amazing precision; to the naked eyes, it looks like the lid rub against the lense but there is always a small space between the lid and the lense to guarantee that the lid will never damage the lense.  Beside the precision design of the lid, this camera takes great pictures every time.  I tried it in a totally dark room with the flash of course, and it turned out to be like a picture was taken out doors.","I have had my Olympus D460 for about two weeks now and it is a dream come true. Simple. Easy to use. Treat it like a straight point and shoot and just click away.  The zoom feature lets you frame what you're looking at IN THE VIEWFINDER(almost like an SLR). The standard PnS green light-red light also tells you when everything's ready and then --bingo-- you've got another good picture.  The D460 also has some bells and whistles that advanced amateurs or even pros will like.  My favorite:  a white balance adjustment that lets you use the available light from fluorescents or incandescants. That's an important feature, because this camera is very sensitive in even low light, and it permits good, color balanced photos in marginal light.  My earlier digital camera experience was with a Sony Mavica MD90, a much more expensive camera.  Frankly that Sony can't hold a candle to the D460.  Accessories: I bought the SanDisk FlashPath (Floppy Disk Adapter) with the D460 to eliminate PC cable hookups.  This took some looking because many retailers are out of them. But it was worth the search, because this particular FDA comes with batteries installed and a simple no-fuss installation disk.  All in all, the Olympus D460 camera is an excellent value and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to make a quality yet low cost entry into digital photography","Received the camera from Amazon in 8 days. New to digital cameras. Read the instruction book and was taking and printing pictures in acouple hours. The color looks so real and the detail is extremely clear. If you take a bad picture the camera has alot of features to improve the lighting or color. Happy with purchase....","I went shopping all around the internet trying to find a good digital camera for a medium price.  I figured if I am going to spend this much money, I might as well buy a nice camera.  After 2 monthes of researching and comparing, I finally made up my mind on this camera.  It had been my number one choice all along, but after reading it's specs, it was like icing on the cake.  Now that I have it, I can take perfect pictures that look incredible and print witht the same quality as regular film.  I strongly recomend this camera to anyone.  Not only should you purchase this camera, but I also suggest an AC Adapter and rechargeable batteries.  Both are well worth the extra money.  I also purchased a carrying case, a 16 mb memory card, and a panorama lens, but you can get along without some of these. -brett","I was hesitant to make the jump to a digital camera.  I bought this baby, and boy am I glad I did.  The pictures are remarkable, even when printed 8x10 on my printer (nothing fancy, just an HP 712C.)  I get better detail on closeups than I do using my SLR camera.  Pictures turn out great even in very low light.  Plus, if you pick up a set of rechargable batteries, this guy is practially free to use.  No more spending dough on film or developing.  I highly recomend this camera for anyone looking to jump into digital pictures.  It's well worth the money and will save you a bundle.","I was in the market for the Sony Cybershot DSC 30. I really liked the way that the camera looked and was anxious to have one. Then I did a little research. I found out that Sony has there cameras made by an outside manufacturer. sony also does not share their technology with other manufacturers so if you want to accesorize, then you have to pay the inflated prices for \"genuine Sony parts\". Olympus has been in the camera biz for years. So I asked myself why am I going to buy a product from a company that doesn't really specialize in cameras? It is also good to know that there is only one kind of storage media that you can use with the Sony Cybershots. Conviently, Sony has also jacked the price on there \"Memory Sticks\" because it's the only thing that you can buy for it. The Olympus D460 does every thing that the Cybershot does, save for the swivel LCD display. The Olympus also uses smart card media, so you can be a little more selective in what can fit your budget. Speaking of budgets, I saved about $120.00, and still feel that I got a better camera that what Sony could ever offer. If you like affordability, convenience, and a simple camera, the Olympus D460 is the camera for you. If you like to pay for a name, then buy a SONY!","Great quality images.  An automatic flash (you have to manually flip the flash up) would have been nice. Once I figured out how to use the flash I parked the SLR.<br />Camera has a great \"slide show\" capability with simple to use the video output to VCR or TV but...  you can't upload images to the camera from the computer. If you could you'd be able to create a slide show from several different sessions with the included 8MB card.  Maybe I have to get that floppy adaper for my Smart Media after all??","After doing some research out there, my girlfriend bought this digital camera.  The performance is very good, but there are still somethings I feel quite annoying. First, we just could not ignore the noise when the len zoom in/out. Second, after taking a picture, you can just review if for about a second or two, if you want to review it again, you have to turn off the camera, and turn on the LCD display again.. very unconvenient. Third, we have to lift the flash light to make it work. well, it is not totally automatic. And last, there's no USB interface to connect to PC, and the com port interface is too slow.. nobody can tolerate this I believe.  You have to buy an extra reader.<br />In summery, it's a good product with excellent performance, on the other hand, based on my personal experience, my advice is, go to the market, try and feel it yourself, and think twice.","I have not used this camera, rather the D360L.  However, when I upgraded to Windows ME (to take advantage of \"My Pictures\" and the built-in digital camera stuff), my camera wouldn't work.  It wasn't in the driver list, so I contacted Olympus.<br />This was my response (read - \"doesn't work - we're not doing anything abount it\")<br />\"The newer Olympus digital camera models -- D360L, D400Z, D450Z, D460Z,  D490Z, C2000Z, C2020Z, C211Z, C2500L, C3000Z, C3030Z, and the C21 -- are not designed to use twain drivers, plug-ins, or the mini-apps to  communicate with the computer.  The Olympus Camedia utility software  communicates with these camera models to download (copy) your picture  files into a folder on your computer harddrive where they can be  accessed by any software program that can use jpeg or tiff formatted  graphic files.  Only the following Olympus digital cameras are twain  compliant:  D200L, D220L, D300L, D320L, D340L, D340R, D500L, D600L, and  D620L.  Only the D200L and the D300L can not communicate using Camedia. \"","I've had this camera now for about four months, and let me tell you it is the best digital camera that I've owned. The picture quality is outstanding, even in low resolution mode..It's easy to use and the 8MB card is plenty for your photo needs. I still have the two original lithium bateries that came with the camera and they are still going strong. Get yourself an AC adaptor so you can save your bats while downloading your images.","This camera requires two battery packs that come packaged with the unit. Each pack consists of two batteries sealed together in a plastic casing. Both casings fit in the camera in only one direction.<br />At first glance it appears the polarity marks printed on the battery casings are incorrect and do not match polarity instructions inside the camera.<br />Solution:  Print all four polarities (rather than two) on each battery pack to eliminate the confusion.<br />Also, the battery compartment door requires TLC to close which concerns me because it's plastic.<br />Initial comments with regard to camera options and photo quality are very favorable......and still learning.","Well first of all I should say that this camera is perfect for the principiant or \"tourist\" photographer, that the only thing he want's to do is to capture the moment without controlling it all. The cammera does it all, but when you want to control the exposure or the WB or even the sensitivity you'll have some problems. You can't DO a White Balance, instead you have some Pre asigned items to choose, and you just have 3 different sensitivities to choose. The other problem is that you can't control the focus or the diaphragm or the shutter speed.  My mother bought this camera in the US 1 year ago and I've been taking pictures of everything I see in the street. It haves a good image quality (maybe you'll see the lights a lil bit strange when checking your pictures) and even you can shot 166 pics with the worst quality (in an 8 mb card).  I discovered that when you connect it to the Videorecorder you can record what you are seeing. So if you have the old \"porta pack\" equipment you can use it even as a CAMCODER! (forget about the sound).  The worst part of the camera is the battery consumption. I got tired of wasting lots of $ buying more and more batteries. It needs 4 AA batteries and if you use the LCD they'll last 15 minutter or something. Maybe you woun't take this to serious when you buy an item....","Well first of all I should say that this camera is perfect for the principiant or \"tourist\" photographer, that the only thing he want's to do is to capture the moment without controlling it all.

But what I can tell you is that wasting 4$ (here that's what it costs 4 AA batt) for just 15 minutes is not a deal.","The D460Zoom is my second Olympus Digital Camera.  My first was the D360, which was a great camera until a child put the batteries in wrong and burned it up!  I cannot say enough good things about the D460Zoom...It writes the files quickly allowing follow-up shots in 2-3 seconds. It has easily understood controls, and takes better quality photos than most digital cameras I have seen -- including my brother's large and bulky Sony.  The autofocus and zoom both work without hitch and allow a considerable amount of leaway in composing your shots.  One of the things I find especially exciting is its ability to adopt to difficult lighting situations.  You can take pictures in very difficult bright and dark shadow conditions and get excellently exposed results.  I am comfortable taking pictures in any lighting situation, indoors or out.<br />While there is some media that hold more pictures than the smart media cards, the smart media cards are very small and easy to use.  I bought a card reader [and] it is as easy to down load pics as to read a disk--faster even.  For the money, this camera is as good or better than many costing twice as much.","Consideration #1 - Why did I choose the Olympus over other \"computer\" brands?<br />Because the Olympus line of digital cameras in general beats out any other line of cameras out there as far as picture quality, and the D460 is no exception. It is always a rule of thumb to buy cameras from a real camera company, if only because the optics will always be top notch.  Once you have taken pictures with a computer brand camera, and seen the prints, then switched to an Olympus or Nikon etc... you will definitely see the difference in quality.<br />Consideration #2 - Why did I choose the D460 over a Nikon?<br />The main factors were price and battery life.  The Nikon cameras take to sucking your batteries dry given even moderate use of the LCD, whereas the 400 series of Olympus cameras are quite the road warriors when it comes to batteries.  Now remember that this camera does not come with rechargeable batteries (it includes high-powered NiMH one time use batts) you should plan on spending the extra $30-50 on a set of rechargeable and a charger.<br />Other Points of Consideration -<br />Also plan on getting another smart media card if you are going to take more than a few pictures in one use, because the included card (8mb SmartMedia) only holds 16 SHQ quality pictures, (the format with the best compromise between space and quality) SHQ mode uses a JPEG compression to make file size smaller. Adding a 16MB smartmedia card will get you 32 pictures at that compression, and a 32mb card will get you 64 pictures, and so on...  Also remember that you can readily exchange between cards when one gets full, so you don't loose the functionality of that original 8mb card that comes with the camera if you get another one. You can just take it out when it's full and stick in your new one. (just keep them in their case, and don't loose the little things, because boy are they expensive!)<br />Verdict -<br />Overall, this a really a great buy and will serve you well while on vacation, or at your kid's soccer game.  If you want to make your pictures bigger than 8x10, however, you might want to upgrade to the D490. If not, have fun with this great camera!","The Olympus D-460 Zoom is a great digital camera! The picture capacity is super high when set on the SQ setting (about 114 picture capacity). Quality remains superb. To me, its very user friendly. Easy to view and delete photos and easy to zoom (optical and digital). The only thing I dont like is that optional items are so expensive. I found out that you can take the \"film disk\" to a local Wal-Mart and get the disk developed. They have the $100 adapter for the Smart Media disk. The Camedia software that comes with it, is also user friendly. Great first digital camera!","I wanted a camera that was easy-to-use and portable with great picture quality. I got everything in this camera. I have a regular Olympus camera and am quite satisfied with that one. So I decided to give this one a try. In my yorkie discussion group we all swap pics of our dogs. And I must say the Olympus takes the best photos. Go to the new ofoto site on Amazon. I was going to buy a photo quality printer, but why? Ofoto lets you display photos so your friends and family can buy them too. Back to the camera...I love it, buy it!","I was debating whether to buy Olympus or to go for the 2 Megapixel Kodak DC 280. After reading loads of reviews and asking several people I decided to go for Olumpus D460 Zoom. And let me tell you the camera takes amazing pictures! I hardly need to access the menu and change the settings. The pictures are superb ... the detail is amazing. I shoot at the highest SHQ setting and the results are great!<br />.... I had thought I'll find the lens cover an inconvenience as a lot of people said they were having problens closing the camera ... but it works ok for me.<br />I also bought a Viking USB reader and extremely glad I did...makes it very, very conveneient to download the photos to your PC. ...","I have been using this camera for about a month now.  I did extensive research on the internet for digital cameras $500 and under. The runners where Olympus 360L, Kodak 210, and Olympus D460Z.  And it is a very impressive camera overall.  The camera itself offers wide angle or zoom 3x shots.  It also offers a 3x cropping to bring it to 6x.  It's menu is very easy to use out of the box.  Has 2 menu modes, one with camera active, one when it's not active (setup mode.) It's auto focus is by holding the button halfway down for a sec, then clicking.  It's wide/zoom is a small lever next to shutter button for easy access.  You can use it's LCD or to save on batteries it's normal view frame for taking shots.  The smartmedia card and batteries easily installs/uninstalls.  If offers what they call a Paranormal mode which takes multiple pictures on one frame.  It offers a sequence mode that lets you take 10 pictures back to back with for a series shot.  You will need to format your SmartMedia card if it's not from Olympus, but it's fast and easy to do.  My only gripes are when closing the lens cover, you have to be careful and let the lens retrack first, so you just close it a little, then the rest of the way after lens is back in.  The flash flips up, and seems a little clumsey there, but it works fine.  You will need to purchase more than just this camera when you buy it.  What it comes with is: 2 lithium batteries, a hand strape, an 8meg smart media card.  And what else you need would be: a carrying case (est $30), a bigger smart media card (I got a 64meg est $60), NiMH Batteries w/charger(they aren't cheap but worth it est $110), a smart media reader (est $40), and maybe the power adaptor (est $60).  With a 64meg card I get 36 shots in sqhq mode.  And with my NiMH batteries, after one month of use, I still haven't had to replace them.  Normal alkline recharables last maybe 30-40 shots, the NiMH last more like 300-400 shots.  I use the lithium that came with it for backup batteries and place them in my case with 8meg memory card.  A SmartMedia reader is a must for getting the pictures to your computer.  Otherwise you will have to use the serial connection to the camera and very slowly d/l the pics.  Which means you'd have to have a power adaptor because it would drain your batteries.  With a media reader, it's like using a zip drive, and see the MediaSmart card as another drive, and you just drag and drop your pics to your drive, fast, simple, and very slick.  If you choose to purchase this camera, you will be more than pleased that you did.  But be aware, you will need to make a few more purchases in accessories to truely enjoy this camera.","Overall I really like my D460, but having owned it now for half a year it has one weakness: the lengthy delay between taking consecutive photos. In the medium density \"HQ\" mode, each photo takes about 2-3 seconds to write to the SmartMedia memory card. This delay can be infuriating. When photographing evolving action, sometimes I take a photo too early - the action gets more interesting and I want to take another shot. But if it is within 2-3 seconds of taking a prior shot, the D460 can't help you. Press away at the shutter button all you want (even with the flash totally off). It is not listening.<br />Frankly, most of the time this is not a problem. But this delay bother me so much that I went out and also bought the Olympus D490 Zoom, which is almost identical to the D460 but adds a RAM memory buffer. Delay between shots is almost zero. Shoot as fast as you want. Another advantage, having tested both of my cameras side-by-side, is that the D490 \"boots-up\" more quickly and therefore is ready to use just a fraction sooner. Instead of buying two cameras like me, maybe check out the D490 as well. Currently it is... more than the D460, and maybe worth it.<br />Otherwise, the D460 has been a work-horse. I've shot about 1,000 images and surprisingly the TFT LCD display on the back of the camera has turned out to be quite scratch-resistant. After 6 months and a trip to Italy, it looks just as pristine as the LCD display on my new D490. Both fine cameras (though wish I owned only one).","I bought this camera from Costco cheaper than Amazon.com.  Amazon.com is way too expensive.  This is a great camera.  I also bought an accessory called Flashpath which allows you to transfer the photos effortlessly to  the PC using your 1.44 floppy drive.  I highly recommend it, however,  search the internet for the lowest prices, because prices vary greatly.","GREAT CAMERA USER FREINDLY AND BEAUTIFUL PICTURES EASY TO USE SOFTWARE  GREAT FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS. YOU WANT BE DISAPPOINTED","I was very happy with this camera, it has nice features, nice quality  photos for the price, however - do not buy the SanDisk reader as you may  run into problems.  Found the rechargeable batteries to work the best with  this camera - will save you a lot of money!","This is a great camera for the money.  I have really enjoyed mine.  It has  all the resolution I need for email.  If you are thinking about paying more  for extremely high resolution, wait until next year.  The new CMOS  technology is suppose to yield resolution better than 35mm film at a  drastically lower price.","I'm pretty satisfied with this camera. I originally was going to buy the  360, but I switched to this one because it includes the zoom<br />The Olympus  D-460L is very easy to use, and produces great shots even in normal  quality.  Battery's life is OK for me.<br />Perhaps the only complaint is that  it doesn't include a purse that allows to protect it","After reading every review we could find, last year we ventured for the  first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R  digital camera. We were definitely not disappointed.<br />The D460 is this  year's model improving the 340-R by adding a 3x optical zoom in addition to  the 2x digital zoom. For the price you will not match the features and  quality of this camera.<br />After just a few days the camera accompanied us  to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while we nervously left our  Canon SLR at home. The camera performed marvelously. We found the optional  16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our needs, as we easily  downloaded photos each day into our laptop. An 8MB card comes  standard.<br />We were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light  settings. We took shots at our conference including a multimedia  presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was  readable! While staying in the countryside in a traditional Mongolian  \"ger\" (tent), we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky--  even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable!<br />Arriving home we were  completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting  when printed out on our HP Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper. I  doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the  prints and a standard developed snapshot. The enclosed Olympus and Adobe  software is easy to use and functional for most home use. You will  absolutely love the Quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and  panorama shots!<br />One of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating  was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one. If you  frame... say, a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will  discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area. Olympus should  do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders.<br />Apart from that,  you will want to invest in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop  around for the best price. Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for  the flash memory card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the  flash memory card, slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into  any computer. You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all  around your table, plus a significant download time.<br />One last item-- Do  you think a 16MB memory card will be too small for your needs? You can  purchase up to a 32MB smart media card which will give you more than 400  shots at 800x600!","Camera is very easy to use, and produces great shots. Even at its lowest  resolution, the files look good and are very compact (~50K) and so are  ideal for uploading onto websites.<br />The camera really is very inituitive  to use. My only 2 minor whinges are:<br />1. When my camera arrived, I found  it abit larger than I thought it would be!<br />2. Its a bit slow downloading  the files through the supplied serial cable.<br />All in all a great feature  packed camera. Looking back I would definitely re-buy this one!","I research 12 digital camera over a three week period.  I am a technical  specialist for major aerial film and image processing lab in Ohio. The  Olympus was worth the time to research.  I have had the camera for two  months.  It is compact and offers many easy to use fearures.  My wife, a  novice, found the easy to understand and operate.  We use the fine quality  (SHQ) setting with 32 MB card.  The download of images to the PC through  the serial port is efficienlt quick  We have printed several  8.5\"x11\".  I have printed to 13\"x19\" on the HP 1120cse  printer with excellent results.  All images are in the camera jpg format  and written to CDs.  This allows us to work with the images in PhotoDraw,  PhotoShop, and PowerPoint.  I have recommended this camera to our company  president.","The Olympus D-460 Zoom camera is just the ticket to a vacation you haven't even taken yet!  I bought one last Wednesday...It came Friday...not the 4  to 7 stated business days.  I have yet to even take it out of my hands!  Talk about \"Bang for the buck!\".  You get all that and more!  The  best quality of pictures, that I have ever seen for a camera at its price.  No, it does not come with a carrying case...Shame on Olympus.  Big deal!  Buy it...you'll fall in love with photography for under $400.00!  Super  camera!","I'm primarily a 35mm and subminiature photographer and was waiting until digital resolution and price met at a nice point.  The D-460 did it for  me.<br />First, a couple of warnings: 1) Batteries - Although Amazon lists 4  AA alkalines as the power source, don't count on it.  The two included  Olympus lithium batteries (which are each the same size as a pair of AAs)  are a special high output chemistry.  You will be VERY unhappy if you take  the camera to an event and only have one set of alkalines.  Digital cameras  use a lot of juice, especially when you download and when you use the LCD  screen.  The consumer problem is that the Olympus batteries (CR-V3, or p/n  LB-01E) are VERY hard to find.  I've not seen any in camera or electronics  stores, although you can purchase them for $14 ea directly from Olympus --  and Olympus says you should be able to buy them from several internet  vendors, but the only one on their list that even showed the batteries was  B&H, and they didn't have any in stock (@ $10 ea.).  The next best  thing is use rechageable NiMh cells.  You can spend a hunk of money and buy  the Olympus cell/recharger set, or can hunt around electronics stores and  buy something for about half the price -- make sure you get AA cells in the  1400 to 1500 mAh range. 2)  Price - The normal street price for this camera  is now $399. 3)  Downloading Photos - Although you can use the included  serial cable, you'll also use a lot more batteries.  If you have a USB port  on your computer, you should consider getting getting a SmartMedia external  drive.  They're inexpensive and fast and easy to use.<br />But to the good  stuff.  Side-by-side tests against my office's Sony Mavica's give the  Olympus the edge at the same 640 x 480 resolution.  When you go to the  higher 1280 x 960 resolution, I think you'll be pleased with the results.  The optical finder makes it much easier to take snapshots, especially in  bright sunlight, where LCD only cameras leave you wondering what you're  shooting at.  The 3:1 zoom ratio is comfortable, and you can do accurate  closeups using the LCD screen for a viewfinder.  If you go ahead and buy  the SmartMedia external drive, you should consider getting an additional  8MB (one comes with the camera) or 16MB card.<br />I think that for many  applications, including some professional use, you will find this to be a  good performing camera at a good price.<br />(The only reason I gave it a  4-star rating is because of the so-so availability of the lithium  batteries, and the fact that it took a little more digging than expected to  figure out what was really going on with those things.)","Everything about his camera is good, not least of all the best lens cover available which is important in a camera that gets bounced around.  However, be sure to check the documentation (which in earlier versions has  been inadequate) and whether this model provides USB connectivity (earlier  versions did not and required a reader and adaptor).","This is my second digital camera, replacing a Casio QV-700. The picture quality seems excellent and I was amazed at how vivid the colors turn out  with this camera. I have taken about a hundred pictures with the camera so  far and all but a few turned out excellent, and the ones that didn't were  my fault. One big advantage this camera has over my Casio is that the LCD  monitor has it's own power switch, so you can leave it off while taking  pictures and it saves on battery power.  There are several settings  such as ISO, white balance, etc that can be manually adjusted for better  picture quality or left on automatic if you rather not mess with them (like  myself). The on-screen menus are pretty user friendly after you read the  manual.  With the included 8MB Smartmedia card, you can record from  2-122 photos, depending on which of the 5 quality settings you choose. In  the 1280x960 resolution mode, you can take 36 pics in High Quality mode  (default), 18 in Super High Quality, or 2 pics in Super High Quality-TIFF  (uncompressed). In the 640x480 resolution mode, you can take 32 pics in  High Quality mode or 122 in Normal mode. Picking up a 16, 32, or 64 MB card  will greatly increase your capacity. I plan on getting a 32 MB card myself,  which will reportedly hold 146 pics in 1280x960 High Quality mode (or up to  489 pics in 640x480 normal mode).  The 3x zoom was better than expected.  There are a few things about the camera that I don't care for, such as  the main power switch. Instead of having an actual switch, you have to open  the lens barrier, which isn't a problem, however when you go to turn the  camera off, you have to close the lens barrier part way, then wait for the  lens to retract, then close the cover completely. Also, you must manually  flip up the flash.  Although there are a few minor things I wish were  different, don't pass up this camera!","I'm glad I got this camera.  I've been debating for a long time whether to get a digital camera.  I use a variety of digital cameras at work and know  how useful they are.  This one had the price that I wanted to pay and the  performance of $1000+ cameras from a couple of years ago.  The colors look  great.  The software is a breeze to use.  The quality of the camera seems  to be very good so far.<br />I would have scored this camera 5 out of 5 if it  came with a case and a USB connector.  It is slow to download with the  serial cable.  I still haven't been able to take any good photos at night:  firework displays, city lights, full moon, etc.<br />I'm planning on  purchasing a case, a 32 MB Flash Card and a USB Reader.","This camera exceeded my expectations.  It is my third digital camera.(I have two other Sony's.)<br />I like the portability of this camera vs. the larger Sonys.  This will travel on my bicycle when I would have let the others behind.<br />The picture quality is quite excellent, and when I take the time to adjust the white balance the results are enhanced...","I have never used a digital camera before but was able to take the Olympus D460 Zoom out of the box and start taking pictures, viewing them and downloading them onto our computer in a very short time.  The pictures are  excellent and the camera is extremely easy to use.","This camera takes excellent pictures, and once you take the time to orient yourself to the controls, it is very easy to use. I shopped around and got a good price on the D460 (less than $499) and am very, very happy. The  batteries have also lasted longer than I expected. I've taken pictures out  doors and indoors with and without flash. The flash has several settings,  much like a good SLR camera, but the camera can also adapt to low-light  without flash and keep the warm tones.<br />A feature not often mentioned is  the fact that the camera includes a cable to hook it up to your TV and view  pictures at a large size, give a slide show to friends-- or even take  pictures while using the tv screen as a viewer. Surprisingly fun to do.<br />I  followed another reviewer's recommendations and bought rechargeable AA NiMH  batteries and charger (the maha 1550s in a combo kit) at Thomas  Distributing for a good price. The Olympus tech support people told me just  to make sure you buy batteries with at least 1450 mAH--higher is better for  juicing those downloads. They do not recommend using any AC adapter other  than the olympus one because it might damage the camera (and I assume it  might violate your warranty), but other sources report that the one sold at  thomas distributing is fine. One more thing--if you buy another card, get  the Olympus brand if you intend to use the panorama feature--apparently  other cards don't support this.<br />The only reason I give this camera 4 out  of 5 stars is that it doesn't connect to USB; the cable supports serial  ports and mac adb ports, but doesn't have a usb connection. This means you  have to buy a USB reader if you have a hot new computer, although you might  want to do this anyway.","I purchased the Olympus D460 Zoom from amazon.com about two months ago. It does everything it says it does. The panorama function works great with the included software. The camera includes some batteries, which, curiously  enough, were not even rechargeable. But they did last quite a long time.<br />Luckily, the design of the camera makes it rather durable. I was shocked  when I saw my new camera headed for the pavement as it slipped out of my  hand, but relieved when I found it had survived with only a few scratches  on the lens cover. The camera still works fine.<br />The D460 does not seem  to handle night landscape shots very well without a tripod, nor motion  shots in low light unless you use the flash.<br />Everything else works fine.  It seems to have an autopilot for non photographers like me.","This is my first experience with digital photograpy.  I am a novice in this area, actually in photography in any manner.  I did alot of research (not knowing the meaning of pixels etc)and found this got the best  comments.  Now I know why.  It is SO easy!  The pictures are terrific.  I  had my pictures taken, downloaded and shared online and on printed  materials within one day of getting it.  The batteries (which everyone  seemed to gripe about) are still the originals.  It's just so easy to do.  I absolutely recommend this as the pictures are of high quality.  I used it  at my sisters wedding, printed a picture and framed it.  The printing of  the pic was a test but came out so good it now is framed and nobody would  know the difference.  (It was printed on ordinary office paper!)  The only  drawback to this camera is the lens cover which you need to push halfway  over to retract the lens.  You just need to be gentle.  Otherwise, it's a  fab camera.  I still don't know what a pixel is!","Originally I bought the 360 which I was totally blown away with the pictures it took. However I decided to spend a few more dollars and get the 460 because the zoom was more useful than just a point and shoot. I wasn't  disappointed, besides taking the same great pictures, the controls are more  ergonomically arranged, and has a few more bells and whistles.  The  only down side that I can find with the camera is turning it off. You must  be careful not to hit the lens barrel with the lens cover when sliding it  back.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who is interested in  something a cut above a basic point and shoot camera.","Hello folks!<br />I bought my 460 on 6/22/00 and got it on the 28th.  Let me tell you that I'm am on fire!  I love this thing!  I can take 18 superfine shots or over 30 med quality pics.  In fact, here's a med quality pic right  here: [...] (352kb).  That was taken with simply  pointing and clicking, so it would have looked even better had I changed  some settings.  This camera has plenty of more adjustments to make (and I  will love learning them).<br />However, expect to buy a USB reader and another  card (I bought the \"Viking IntelliFlash USB Flash Memory Reader\"  and  \"SanDisk SDSM-32-490 32MB SmartMedia Card\") which will add a  little over a hundred bucks more to the price.  Also, the software  sometimes doesn't seem to recognize when the camera is plugged in (no big  deal, just turn off and on again) and with the serial connection plan on  waiting a long while!  Once I get me reader, I plan to not even use the  software provided unless I want to change some settings in the camera (like  the time), or if I want to stitch pan shot together.<br />I do want to address  one thing a guy said about its feel.  It does NOT have a cheap feel.  YES,  it has a plastic case, but it doesn't have that cheap feel like some of  Fuji's lower end cameras (if you've held that square one they have, you'll  know what I mean).  The 460 has the feel of its $200 range 35MM  brethren--which is what I would expect.<br />To top this all off, I've yet to  change the batteries!<br />Bottom line...I love it!","I just purchased the 460 Zoom to capture everything on my Honeymoon in Hawaii.  I never had a digital camera before and after doing a lot of research and reading reviews like these I settled on this camera.  It was  definitely the right choice.<br />Compared to some higher end cameras it was  very reasonably priced and worth the risk.  I didn't want to buy my first  digital camera for $800. The quality of the LCD is great so you can review  your pictures immediately and clearly.  The camera is so easy to use.  I  had it figured out for the most part before opening the instructions, but I  would definitely give those a look.  The zoom is good for the price of the  camera.  The best thing about this digital camera is that it is the size of  a regular camera.  There is no extra baggage.  It fits into a regular  camera case with no problems.<br />Downloading the pictures is really easy.  I  did purchase a reader for the Smart Media Cards (which is basically the  film) which really quickens the downloading to computer process.  It was  only like $30.  I also got some rechargeable batteries, but I didn't even  need them until 8 days into my honeymoon.  The orginal batteries lasted a  long time and through a lot of exploring.<br />I would suggest getting a  bigger Smart Media card than the one that comes with the camera (8mb).  I  got a 32 mb card which basically gives you close to 200 pictures in the  middle range of quality.<br />For a non-professional who just wants to capture  moments of fun and wants the ease of downloading them to the computer and  then sending them to people, this camera is perfect.  I haven't tried to  have them printed up by a website yet, but I will do that soon.  It is a  solid product and I would always side toward Olympus.","The Olympus D460 is really awesome. I have owned a few of these types of cameras already, from the \"early days\" of digital photography and onward. This camera is really refined, they cleaned up alot of earlier  mistakes and made the whole experience a pleasure. I very highly recommend  digital photography and this camera in particular. Meanwhile, Yahoo has set  up a service to upload these pictures and have them printed on photo paper.  All in all, you can't miss.","This is my first digital camera.  For the money, I'm convinced it can't be beat.  The pictures are first rate.  For a \"lower\" priced camera, it is full of all of the bells and whistles you could ask for.  The  Panorama feature is my favorite.  If you're not into gizmos, just point and  shoot.  It's very simple.  I've never used one before and I was e-mailing  pictures to my family within 30 minutes after the UPS driver handed it to  me.<br />Only two minor complaints.  The attached lens cover (which is great)  has to be closed part way until the lens retracts back into the camera.  This has to be done gingerly as it is too easy to jam it against the side  of the lens by accident.  Also, on the top of the camera is a small  electronic control panel that tells you how many pictures you have left,  picture quality etc.  The symbols across the top row are very hard to see  as they are too close to the camera body.  A slight shadow covers them  unless you have plenty of light.<br />All things considered, I'd buy it again  in a second.","I've been using my Olympus D460Z for two months now. This is my first digital camera purchase. I love it!<br />It's a rugged camera that I use for documenting local events for publishing almost daily on the web. For my  purposes, it does a wonderful job. The pictures are excellent for  publishing on the web and are still good enough for printing out on  photographic paper.<br />With a 16MB card (purchased separately), I get 73  pictures at High Quality mode or 218 at Standard Quality mode. With that  many shots available I feel free to take many shots knowing that I'll end  up with only a few good ones.<br />The batteries have never run out on me  during a photo session (normally 3 or 4 hours of taking pictures and  frequently turning the camera on and off) I usually don't use the monitor  screen that much...which I've been told drains the power rather  quickly.<br />I would recommend getting a FlashPath floppy disk adapter. It  works faster when you're uploading pictures to your computer.<br />One thing  to note is that there is a delay of about 1 second between the time you  press the shutter button and the time the camera actually takes the  picture.<br />One of the things that sold me on the Olympus was the built-in  lens cover. I never have to worry about losing the cover and since it is  fairly compact, I feel comfortable sliding the camera into my front pocket.","I had occasion to buy the 360 and 460 recently. Other reviews adequately describe why both are great cameras and which accessories you'll need.  Essentially, they're the same box(1.3 MegaPixel) and microcode. The same  \"darkroom\" software, CamediaMaster 1.2, comes with both. The 460  has a better user interface and a zoom.  The buttons and menus are somewhat  more intuitive, but the 360 interface isn't bad to begin with.  The digital  2x zoom is the same on both, the close-up (macro) mode on the 360 is  4\", vs. 8\" on the 460.  The feature set (e.g.: ISO, spot  metering) is similar, if there're any differences they're minor and subtle.  The ease-of-use factor of the 360 is better.  On the 460, you have to wait  for the lens to come out of the casing, and you must remember to open the  flash.  Unless you *really* need zoom, you can save yourself two hundred  bucks by purchasing the 360.","I must say I'm pretty happy with the Olympus 460 Zoom.  I originally was going to buy the 360, but I figured if I was going to spend the money for a digital camera, I might as well get the zoom.<br />With the 460 comes some advanced photography features like spot metering, fill-in flash, etc.  Those features may seem useless to amateur photographers, but if you take  the time to learn the features, you'll end up with better pictures.<br />The  TV wire is pretty cool, and even the pictures with the lowest quality look  pretty good on TV.<br />The LCD screen on the camera is very sharp and has  amazing color.  I just wish there was some way to cover the screen to  protect it better.<br />A downside to the Olympus is that it doesn't come  with a lot of accessories.  I'm going to have to buy stuff like a camera  case, battery recharger, USB adapter, and a 32 MB card.  ....","I'm very pleased with my purchase of the Olympus D460Z digital camera.<br />Pro: 1) Small footprint, pocket size, same as a regular 35mm point-n-shoot camera. 2) Easy to use, all the buttons and manual settings  are very clear. The overall layout is great. 3) Picture quality is very  good. 4) 3X optical zoom is fairly powerful. 5) Many useful features, such  as panorama, date imprinting, manual ISO, varies of flash modes... 6) Comes  with 3 instruction booklets of 3 different languages so you don't need to  carry a thick manual for the part that you can't read. 7) Good overall  value, quality and features.<br />Con: 1) Hard to tell if a photo has been  taken/captured because there's no clicking sound or other indications.  There are warning beeps and orange/green warning lights, but they come on  for many different reasons. 2) the flash light does not automatically pop  open when turn on the camera, so if there is not enough light, it's really  hard to tell if the picture has been taken. So the flash light has to be  manually pop open in order for it to be automatic. Manytimes I have to read  the picture count or \"write\" indication to be sure that a picture  is indeed captured. 3) The softwere that comes with the package has limited  features. 4) No AC adaptor comes with the package (I know, asking for  SmartMedia or UBS adaptor is really too much).<br />Note: If you have software  for other serial devices installed, make sure you exit them (modem and  serial mouse have NO problem). For example, I have PalmPilot's HotSync  software installed, and it conflicts with this photo software (The warning  messages do not help at all as in all cases). I called Olympus technical  support, and get the answer without much waiting.","I did a lot of research before I bought this camera and had it narrowed down to two.  I decide on this one because I had owned the similarly styled 35 mm and loved it.<br />I like the fact that there is no lens cap to loose,  but the lens is still protected.  I use it to take promo pictures of bands,  so the location can be a bit hostile (bars and nightclubs) and I wanted  something that I felt was at least somewhat protected.<br />I was more than  thrilled when I uploaded my pictures to a site to have 35mm quality prints  made and found that I could get exceptional 8x10 pics from just the middle  setting of the quality choices. But even in the lowest setting the pictures  are great for website postings.<br />I bought a 16mg card to go with it and I  got 3 complete shows worth of pictures and with the Flashpath adapter, the  websites are getting updated faster than ever.<br />I also bought 2 sets of  rechargeable batteries and have found that I can get a whole weekend of  shows (12-15 hours)on them even using the LCD panel and it's still cheaper  than buying disposable.","I'll echo most of the other reviews here: like the D-450Z, the D-460Zis a great digital camera for the price. Though I disliked the switchto the cheaper plastic housing with this model, the increased ease of use when navigating the menus more than makes up for it. Like the previous camera, you still get high-quality digital pictures with a number of features including red-eye removing flash, television display of pictures, 3x optical (lens) and 2x digital (computer) zoom, and a host of other features which make this camera one of the best in it's class.<br /> But since the earlier releases in this line, digital camera technology has increased while price has decreased (thanks in a large part to earlier models in this line, which took the market by storm). You can now get cameras with a higher level of megapixels and resolution for about the same price as the D-460Z such as Nikon's Coolpix 800 and the Kodak DC280. You should go to your local. . . consumer electronics store and look at ALL of your choices before deciding on which model to purchase (and then purchase it on-line because it is cheaper ;). Even though the D-460Z is no longer \"cutting edge,\" I still believe it has enough features and stunning quality to let it surpass many of the other choices in its class.<br /> Accessories: Expect to spend a few hundred dollars in additional accessories for this camera. I recommend at least 8 NiMH rechargable batteries for power (which you can buy on-line or at your local supermarket), a USB Smartmedia reader if your computer supports USB (this greatly decreases SLOW picture transfer times from the camera to the computer), and a \"soft\" protective case for the camera (the Olympus soft leather case is nice but over-priced unless you get it on sale). As well, 2 additional 32 meg or a 64 meg SmartMedia card is useful, and will allow you to take a vacation's worth of pictures without have to delete any (at least at the rate I take pictures). The camera lets you take a little more than 2x the SmartCard's megs in super-high quality, compressed images. You can buy these on-line at places like amazon.com... but the Olympus-brand accessories tend to go out of stock quickly.  Note: the SmartMedia cards will eventually wear out, though you'll be able to take tens of thousand (or even hundreds of thousands) of pictures before this happens if you buy a decent-quality card.","D460 birthday gift...In 10 minutes I was foolng with it; made a few mistakes (picture of the sky, the ground, a fence)read the manual got it right the 2nd time, flash and all...showed my grandsons their picts, soon I  was taking everyones picts. Solid construction (the noise from the zoom  lens should be expected, don't know why that person didn't like it)Don't  have to fool with dropping off that cassete anymore but I still love my  regular camera too!","I bought the 460 because I wanted a digital camera that I could stick in my pocket but one that I could also expect to take respectable pictures.  On the first count, with the built in lense shield, the camera is easy to  'bring along'.<br />My expectations have been generally exceeded on the second  count. The camera was purchased in time to document a fantastic mixture of  daffodils at their peak.  The camera's macro mode produces stunning  pictures, the detail and contrast of a bloom that fills the frame is  beautiful.  My guess was and is that the apparent price premium for this  camera goes towards premium optics that only a company like Olympus knows  how to engineer.<br />Color rendition is equally impressive, only flesh tones  under flash seem to be a bit off, and fortunately in the warm direction.  Otherwise, my expectations have been exceeded, it's comparable to 35mm  negative film. And I haven't noticed any significant distortions  either.<br />My comparison shopping indicated that the flashes of all cameras  in this range have a 13 foot range.  I was hoping that the capability to  quadruple the effective ISO to 500 would extend the usable range to 26  feet.  So far, after 250 pictures, I have found the noise in a picture  taken at ISO 500 renders low quality pictures.  I haven't experimented much  with ISO 250.<br />The camera seems to be slow to focus, or I'm too impatient,  one must wait for the green light in the view finder to confirm focus has  been found or fuzzy pictures result.  But this is no SLR, it's a point and  shoot concept and one that, given good lighting, takes fantastic pictures.  I printed a still life on a Textronix Phaser wax printer at 8x10 and was  amazed that I got a frameable picture. I didn't expect this it at only  1.3Meg pixels!<br />By the way, it runs just fine on AA NiMH batteries from  Target or Radio Shack.","D460Z is very unlike the 450Z and it is made of cheap plastic.  Ofcourse, the menu has improved but the overall quality has declined.  I noticed the following:<br />1.  Camera body is made of cheap plastic 2.  The zoom lens makes an annoying noise when you turn the camera on! 3.  Price is falling  down like a rock....","The D460Z is an improved D450Z with much better menu manuevering, easy to use and takes great pictures. If you buy accesories, get a battery recharger for AA batteries and 4-8 Nmh(Nickel Metal Hydride) AA batteries(Thomas Distributing- on the Internet for the batteries and the  charger and adapter if you think you need a 120v adapter but should'nt if  you have a USB card reader) PLUS the USB card reader....The  pictures this camera takes are comparable to a 35 mm if printed out on a  good printer such as the Epson 700 or 750. Lot's of fun, easy to use....","Having just picked up a D460 and really enjoying it, I was interested in how to shoot more and upload faster. Under the D450 reviews, several users recommend getting a flashpath floppy adapter and NiMH rechargable batteries  (these accessories are also compatible with the D460). In reading the  separate reviews for the Olympus brand products, several reviewer suggest  buying non-Olympus products since they are both less expensive and have  more features. The reviewers don't mention where to find these  products.<br />If you are considering non-Olympus products, with your favorite  search engine... for the fastpath use \"flashpath and smartmedia\"  (since there are three types of flashpath standards, \"smartmedia\"  is what Olympus uses). For the NiMH batteries use \"MAHA MH-C204F\"  (the very informative battery review had accidentially transposed the last  two digits, which yields no hits).","I did a lot of research on digital cameras before I purchased the Olympus 460 ZOOM and I am extremely happy with this camera. My criteria were picture quality, advanced features and a price under $500. After a week of  taking over a hundred pictures, I'm very impressed with both the crisp  quality and true to life colors of each picture. It automatically adjusts  to florescent, incandescent, and outdoor light. The selectable ISO settings  makes for very impressive low light pictures. The panorama stitching was  easy to use and very accurate. This will be great for taking seascapes  while on vacation. I'm still on my first set of batteries so battery life  is great. I read a lot of reviews on the D450 ZOOM before I purchased the  D460 and all the small things that owners complained about were fixed.  Olympus really must listen to customer feedback. The menus are easy to use,  it remembers settings when turned off, they even ship three manuals in each  language instead of one in three languages. I recommend picking up a USB  port SmartReader or Floppy adapter. Also get some NiMH batteries and a  charger. You're in for some great pictures with this camera.","After an detailed review of Internet comments about digitalcameras, I searched store to store all over NYC looking for the bestdeal on an easy-to-use quality camera. I wanted a megapixel device that was compact, simple to operate, but with a few advanced features (macro, timer, etc) so that I could completely replace my Olympus SLR zoom film camera. The best deal was at........ south of midtown, for the D460zoom. This camera has a nice menu-driven LCD interface in addition to the top-mount traditional LCD \"frame counter\" display, so you can use it for snapshots or serious framed-in, carefully composed recordings. I use the HiRes mode exclusively, with a 32Mb flash card. It's a dream come true -- I no longer need to use a film camera at all. I can print photo-quality 8x10s on my Mac and HP Desckjet 970Cse for less than the cost of prints. Now I'd like to find a flash-card printer that also can display on a TV.  END","I bought this camera and the pictures are great. The menu system is also a lot easier to use. The best part about it is that the batteries last longer. Not only do I like the way the camera looks (there are some ugly  cameras out there), but I like all the features it has. There is no need to  buy a real expensive camera, this one works great (even with little light)."]},{"name":"HP Photosmart C618","amazon_reviews":["i really need the  instructions  and the disk  for this camera  i have yet to be able to use  it.  i wanted this camera so bad  i got for myself  as a christmas present.  i am hoping someone can help me with the disk so I can use it. thanxs","I bought one of these camera's many years ago.

If you are think of buying this used, which is now your only option, you can't go wrong.","I have had this camera for about a year and I love it. All in all we have taken about 2000 pictures with it and we love the b/w, color, or sepia option. I have taken some really beautiful pictures that are worthy of being framed and out on the wall. I have noticed the battery problem but that is easily fixed by getting rechargeable batteries and putting the quality on good (you still get great pictures). I would say that we can take 125-150 straight shots with the rechargeable batteries. I have not had to talk to HP tech support so I can't comment on that. We did take this camera to Hawaii and got about 400 absolutely great pictures. I also found that it is incredibly easy to download and email my pictures. Once they are downloaded I email them to friends/family or I burn them onto a CD for people as a photo album, it saves a ton of money. I think a lot of the problems that other reviewers have run into have less to do with the actually camera as it does with either tech support, or technology problems with their computers.

We've used SanDisk CompactFlash 64mb and 128mb with no problems.  I am so happy I decided on this camera.  We all love it. It's so easy to use, even my kids are using it.","This was my fist foray into the digital camera arena, and what a wonderful surprise.  I did much research before making the purchase, so I had an idea of what to expect for a low-end camera.  I did not experience the ususal problems I had heard about with digitals: center in viewfinder not true to center of actual picture; color off; focus off, etc. The camera was purchased prior to a vacation in the desert and on a lake and the shots came out beautifully and quite crisp.  The color was stunningly accurate and the shots perfectly focused - even the action shots.  The menu is easy to understand and the camera easy to program. The minuses: indoor shots needing flash are trickier; many have come out either too bright or too dark; and the LED screen presents a much smaller picture than other digitals do.  Additionally, the LED does not have good contrast, making it difficult to see details, despite the control functions for it.  All in all, I am extremely happy with the finished photos and the camera itself.","This was our first digital camera and, after a lot of research, we are happy that we chose this one.  It takes great pictures, lets you know if it is in focus or not, it's easy to use and has a lot of features.  My least favorite things are 1) it occassionaly takes some effort to get an indoor shot \"in focus\" if it's not really bright inside and 2) it takes very few pictures with my rechargable batteries in (so I would hesitate to take it on vacation or something). We use it several times a week around the house and have been very happy with it.","Have had this camera since Father's Day. Took some hinting and I'm glad I persisted. Very pleased with the quality and ease of use. Now I just keep my Nikon SLR in the closet. For every day use this H-P is the best. Like all other digitals it eats batteries pretty fast, but I've invested in several sets of rechargeable NIMH AA's and a couple of chargers so I can keep up. Interested to read about Digita, never heard of it and would like to know more. The card furnished is pretty minimal, would recommend investing in a 32 or 64MB card if you like to take lots of shots - and why not? No film to buy or process.","After extensive research into 2 and 3 megapixel cameras, I settled on the H-P C618xi (identical to the C618 except for included software). I was going to Europe for two weeks and wanted to give digital photography a serious workout. Boy, did I make the right choice!<br />The camera is worth much more than it costs, an idea supported somewhat by resell prices higher than what I paid for it new. It has tremendous versatility: Easy to use automatic features for carefree snapshots and excellent manual capabilities for greater artistic control.<br />I do professional work for feature and spot news stories. Over the last two or three months, I gradually have pared down the \"film\" equipment I keep with me until all I take along is the C618xi. The lower JPEG settings are great for newspapers, yet the highest rez TIFF images reproduce perfectly in 4-color glossy mags. Instead of a bulky kit, now I have only a small tote with a wrist strap, containing the camera, 4 spare AA's, a lens brush and CF memory cards. That will last me all day in just about any setting. If I'm doing a flash-heavy shoot, I carry along 4 extra AA's just in case.<br />This camera is not as power-hungry as some I've seen. However, any user will find that 1600mAH NiMH batteries are the way to go to keep the energy costs down. My personal recommendation is to go with Ray-O-Vac: Their AA's are the highest potency around and they make a great compact 1-hour charger that will charge 4 AA's at once (...).<br />For the amateur or the professional, I can't recommend this camera highly enough. I wouldn't part with it for anything.","We've had the 618 for several months now.  It's a been a great value.  We particularly appreciated the higher resolution and flexibility that this camera offered in the price range.  We paired this camera with a Photosmart 1215 printer and that has made printing very simple (we print by sending images through the camera's infrared port or through the smartcard).<br />HP's basic photoprinting software is very easy to use and allows you to make basic adjustments in photographs prior to printing.  The included 3rd party photoediting software is adequate but not a match for Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements which we purchased later.<br />We'd buy the camera again, but in our next camera we would look for these improvements on the 618:<br />(1) Printed colors seem a bit faded for shots taken in daytime lighting.<br />(2) The LCD display washes out in normal daylight (a problem most of these cameras apparently share).<br />(3) The 16 MB smartcard included is large for cameras in this price range but insufficient (we immediately bout a 64 MB card).<br />(4) Battery life seems short, I'd recommend purchasing the rechargable battery.","Great camera.  I've gotten such surprisingly good results consistently. The macro mode does a great job once you gt the hang of it.","HP C618 has one of the best price/parformance values on the market, yet it only proves the inferiority of digital cameras.<br />Pros:<br />* Great image resolution for a very low price<br />* Very good ergonomics, including the memory card storage<br />* Up to 30 medium-resolution pictures on the accompanying memory card<br />Cons:<br />* Flash-happy.  Basically all you have to do is to stand in a shadow and the camera will trigger the flash.  You'll have to disable it manually very often.<br />* Color shift.  The camera tends to use an excess of green color, which you'll have to offsett with adding yellow and red on most pictures.<br />* Automatic options are shifted towards a low-end point and click cameras, so you'll have to use the display to adjust the picture options exstensivelly.  this has a negative impact on the battery life.","I have just spent 2 weeks or so with the camera but have loved it and would highly recommend it to someone who wants the ease of being able to email your pics driectly without scanning them and at the same time wants to indulge in slightly more serious and artistic forays once in a while.<br />My only crib about this camera till now has been with regards to the power requirements. Make sure you get the best rechargable batteries out there. Other than that the results have been just WOW till now.","I love this camera!  By no means at all am I a technical person but this camera makes me look like I am...  It is so easy to use and the quality is amazing.  It also records 45 seconds of audio which is perfect for sending a birthday greeting.<br />You need to get a bigger memory card, especially if you're going on vacation.  (The one that comes with it is perfect for going out to dinner with friends or parties.)  You should also consider getting a battery recharger because viewing your photos on your camera kills your batteries...  You should also consider the 9v ac adapter.  It will save your batteries while you transfer pics to your computer or when you view them on your television.  The USB connection is pretty quick and easy.<br />Did I mention all the cool lenses you can also pick up?  I love the polarizing, pro-mist, and star lenses.  It makes your pics look really professional.  And I totally dig the HP PhotoSmart printers.  You don't even need to turn on your pc.  Just slip the disk and decide how many and what size.  Just buy it!","The 618 offers many features for a reasonable price.  Menus are easy to understand.  USB uploads are quick and the Scanner/Camera Wizard in Windows ME makes it super easy.  Although others have reported problems with USB and Dell laptops, my Inspiron 5000e works perfectly.<br />I've been using the 618 for 3 months now and taken about 700 pictures.  I would say at least 95% of the pictures are excellent.  My biggest complaint is when you turn the camera on, the lens zooms all the way out and sometimes I don't want to wait for that.<br />Compared to the Sony digital cameras I have used at work, the 618 blows them away.  I do not understand why Sony insists on using a floppy disk to store pictures.  Also, the viewfinder on the 618 works great, so I can turn off the LCD screen to extend battery life.  (The Sony models did not even have a viewfinder, you had to use the LCD screen)","Bought the camera in May went on a 6 week trip from Florida to San Francisco took 1100 pictures uploaded them to my laptop Made cds send them to friends they where amazed at the quality and the vivid colors. I suggest you invest on reghargeable batterries a total of 8 it might save you a buck or two. Easy to use easy to carry great price.","I had previously owned an Olympus D460 zoom digital camera, and it broke on me after owning it for 10 days!!  Not to mention that it came with crummy software and NO USB cable but rather a serial port cable.<br />I waited a while to get a new camera and then came across this gem.  The pictures and 2.1 megapixels provide crystal-clear images, while the software allows you to edit pictures, inserting captions, bacgrounds, frames, etc.  I'm by no means a \"technical\" person, yet I manage to use this camera with ease.  It also comes with a USB cable for quicker uploads onto your computer.<br />A great buy and a steal for the $... price.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed","Purchased the camera .... Excellent pictures and great battery use. Bigger compact card great asset.<br />Had much trouble uploading pictures via USB. Apparently, USB on Dell computers is not powerful enough to support USB uploading. Must buy separate card reader to upload pictures.","Like everyone else, I went to Best Buy and fumbled with the dozen or so digital cameras before leaving totally frustrated at the lack of information that's provided with their products (are you REALLY going to believe what a salesman tells you???).  I did, however, realize that I didn’t like how most of the cameras felt in my hands.  I’m accustomed to having my claws around an SLR, so most of these cameras felt pretty strange.  It seems that these manufacturers are more concerned about how something looks rather than how it performs and its affordability to the average Joe.  Therefore, you get a camera that performs well in a wind-tunnel, but it’s awkward to handle.<br />Have you tried looking through the puny viewfinder on the Canon Elph PowerShots?  Your eyes will water as it peers through the peephole.  Also, you’re guaranteed to lose it since it’s so small (e.g., leave it on a restaurant table…a generous tip).  On the opposite side of the spectrum, all Sony cameras are bulky, and I honestly believe that no two are alike.  Have you tried slipping a Sony Mavica in your shirt-pocket?  Don’t do it unless you wear XXLs.<br />I went home, logged-on, and did my homework prior to dropping [price] based on what some pimply kid with a blue shirt told me.  Consumers are brutally honest, and they’ll wear their emotions on their sleeves.  This is heightened on the internet where anonymity is commonplace.  I noticed that the HP PhotoSmart C618 had many reviews for such a low-key camera.  Only a handful of reviews were negative.  I plodded through ALL the reviews from four websites and decided that this was the one.  I ordered it from eCost.com for [price].<br />Upon receipt, I noticed how it nestled in my hands and had the weight and feel of an SLR.  All of the features were very intuitive and well-placed.  I took three fabulous pictures in the first five minutes (who reads the instructions anymore???).  One action, one portrait, and one B&W.  They turned out so well that I’ll have these committed to photographic paper.<br />The camera lives up to its hype.  One neat feature that no one has mentioned is the camera’s time-lapse mode.  I’ve always wondered what my three dogs do to my house while I’m away earning my keep.  I’m greeted by a trashed living room every day and images of the delinquents rough-housing in my absence occupy my mind.  Now I’ll set the camera on a tripod in a safe corner of the house and let it pop pictures every hour to see what it captures.<br />My lone complaint is the camera’s macro feature.  The dreaded parallax effect will take your image off-from-center for extreme close-ups, but once you pop a few shots to get your bearings straight, you’ll capture what you want.<br />I believe that this camera will make me take better film pictures due to its similar feel and function of an SLR.  The bottom line, however, is to have fun with it.  No film.  Instant gratification.  Maybe along the way capture a special photo that'll hang on the wall for years.  Have fun.  That’s why you’re spending the money, right?","This camera offers impressive quality and features for a reasonable price. This was my first experience with a digital camera so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was surprised to find that the camera is exceptionally easy to use and takes great photographs.<br />You really don't even need to read the manual to start taking pictures. The \"getting started\" guide helps you install the memory card and batteries and then you are off and running. For the most part, all camera function can be figured out by navigation the well designed menus. This is especially good since the full manual is only included in PDF format on the software CD.<br />So far, all of the pictures I've taken have had very nice color balance and depth. Naturally, the quality setting on the camera (of which there are 3) has a signficant effect on the imagine quality.. but I have been satisfied with the results at all quality levels.<br />The included memory card has 16 megabytes of storage.  This will get you about 29 images at medium quality, ~ 15 at high quality and 2 at the high quality setting (which uses no compression).  16 megabytes gives you plenty of storage to get started with the camera, but you'll probably want to invest in something larger once you start using it more.<br />Of course, this camera has it's set of downsides.<br />- On occasion the response time from the zoom is a bit slow. You'll press the zoom buttom (which is nicely located right where your thumb rests) and it might take a second or so for the zoom to move.<br />- The screen on the back of the camera isn't bright enough for outdoor photography. This only becomes a problem when you are using the macro feature. Normally the viewfinder gets the job done, but with macro photos the viewfinder doesn't accurately show what the lens sees so you must use the screen. Unfortunately the screen can be almost impossible to see on a sunny day.<br />- When looking through the viewfinder your nose presses against the rear screen. This doesn't present a problem from a usage perspective but you'll find the screen needs constant cleaning.","Very nice camera! I'm a little worried about touching the LCD preview screen and this camera doesn't quite fit right in my hands yet. Still this did not affect my rating! The pictures are good and the camera has many features for the price. The remote is a surprisingly handy extra. Wish it held more pictures, but if I buy a bigger compact flash card then that problem would be fixed as well! I am very impressed with the camera considering it's low price. A great buy.","I purchased this camera a couple of months ago when the price dropped to [price]and have nothing but raves for it ever since.  Not just from me, but from everyone who have seen it and who I have shared my photos online with.<br />Picture quality is awesome.  The 3x zoom is excellent and the whole camera is very well designed for ease of use.  It has more options than you might need, but you never know.  USB interface is great.  I upload all my photos to Ofoto.com and share them with family and friends.  And prints from the digital images come out as crisp and vivid as film prints.<br />It is bulkier than some other models, but feels more like a camera than others, yet still fits in a pocket.  I tested Canon's Powershot in the store and it just feels too small like a toy.<br />I highly recommend the HP 618 to anyone in the market for a great all-around digital camera.  Be sure to get a higher capacity compact flashcard and rechargeable nimh batteries.  You will definitely need both.","I first bought the Sony MVC FD75 because I thought it would be easy (it uses a floppy disk) instead of a media card.  The pictures were not clear and were dark.  I returned it and purchased this camera and was snapping away right after I put the batteries in it.  Pictures are bright and clear.  There are all kinds of filters that can also be purchased...wide angle,polorized, telephoto etc...so you can do more with the camera.  Had a Cannon Sure Shot for years and wanted to upgrade to a digital....this camera is just as easy to use.  Do yourself a favor and buy this one...","After spending weeks agonizing over which digital camera to buy, I finally decided on the HP 618. Mainly because of the HP name, (I have an HP printer and scanner). The camera is easy to use and takes beautiful pictures. My only complaint is the User's Guide is on CD and I had to print it out myself (I have to take time to study out some concepts).","In addition to all the other comments here, the HP C618 has a couple of very appealing features:<br />- Traditional Pentax \"retro\" appearance, more resolution than most people need, very nice onscreen menus, unique IR blasting features, automatic lens cover, and picture quality is light-years better than my last camera (especially on outdoor shots). The default 16mb card stores 100 800x600 images or 29 1600x1200 images at \"better quality\"<br />- PC Connect mode simulates a generic hard disk to both Macs and Win2K (no software or adapters needed for to connect to an average PC, plug it in using any standard USB printer cable)<br />- Scripting language is very useful, I downloaded several free scripts and documentation from the ... site and had them copied to flash in minutes...I've since written a couple of scripts, including one for \"bracketing\" shots (takes multiple pictures with various exposure or zoom levels)<br />On the flip side, you'll need to accept that...<br />- The battery drain is significant at times...I found some AA couldn't provide enough oomph when the camera what shooting (especially several shots in a row). The includes AA Photo Lithium batteries were flawless and provided 200 shots with a high percentage of flash shots, screen usage, and USB connections. I plan on trying Radio Shack NMH rechargables as people suggest<br />- The flash is too bright  on indoor shots less than ~5 feet...as others suggested, I've taped some tissue over the flash and sometimes also have to reduce the exposure setting to get  a good shot in these cases. If you're doing eBay or inventory work you'll need to set up other sources of light. and disable the camera flash.<br />- There was not as much software included for Macintosh computers...just some generic image editing tools (the ... site claims to have a free software download for Macs but the link is broken and you end up getting their software for an older HP camera). I honestly don't think this is a big deal, as the connections to my Mac are so easy in USB drive mode I'd just assume not clutter up my disk with stuff I wouldn't use.<br />I love this camera...originally I'd thought I'd wanted the cute little Canon ELPH S100 but  the HP has better optics, value, and customization using the scripting language. I also was very impressed with the Kodak 3400 (this was a close call but the asthetics, scripting, 3x zoom, and USB drive emulation on the HP won me over)","My first digital camera but I had no trouble in getting started with it.  My first 29 pictures (default settings) were all good.  The more I discovered about it the better I liked it.  Since most of my pictures go on the family web page, I found that 1/4 picture size (4x6), and quality set on 'good' the pictures are as good as any you find on a computer and they fit perfect on a page at 800x600 res.  And the best thing, you get 101 pictures on the 16mb card that is included.  By Bill Bailey, Kaufman County, Tx","If you are ready to buy a new digital camera then you probably have some idea of what camera you want to buy. If you are like me who is low on budget but still want good performance and features, I strongly recommend C618. Buying a digital camera can be very challenging, especially when lot of manufacturers are bringing in new products every day. When I started to look for a digital camera I first wrote down the features I want and then tried to fit the products that will meet my requirements. Nikon, Canon, Minolta are the only brand names most of the amateur photographers like me know. The name HP will not come to you in first place. But after reviewing my needs and BUDGET I decided to buy HP and I very happy with this product. While judging the digital camera, you must judge it as if it was regular 35mm film camera. The reason for this is because most of the camera manufacturers try to build it in such a way that it will closely match with the film camera. Here is a small review of the camera.  - Camera has very good normal to tele Pentax zoom 3x optical and 2x digital (34-108mm 35 mm  equivalent) which serves most of the picture taking purpose.  - The resolution of 2.11 MP produces very good 5 x 7 prints. Anything above 5 x 7 will reduce the quality.  - Shutter and Aperture priority mode lets you use your creativity. - Excellent center weighted and spot metering. - Zoom flash, the flash moves based on the zoom. (I have taken acceptable quality pictures in absolute darkness with this camera) - Excellent Macro/Close Up focusing range. - AA batteries - NTSC and PAL playback on TV.<br />The most important accessory for taking great pictures with this camera (for that matter any camera) is good quality tripod. When I took this camera for the outdoor shoot, I mounted it on [a]... tripod that I regularly use with my film camera. In place of shutter release cable, I use the infrared remote that comes standard with this camera and the results were impressive. Just like any other film camera, you must first test the camera with various subjects, lighting situation and settings. I have tested the camera for Close ups, Portraits and in studio where I work with studio lights. If you treat this camera with the same basic principles of working with film camera you should get excellent pictures. With digital camera if the final output you want is print, then I recommend that print the pictures with good quality printer. Even if your pictures are good, if you print them using average printer, you will be disappointed and camera may not be at blame. Again the truth is “Excellent technique and average equipment will produce better results than Excellent equipment and average technique”. This camera is budget buy for amateur photographer like me and to date I am very happy with this. A very good quality for the price you pay. Buy additional 128 MB compact flash card and you are all set for vacation with this camera.",". This camera is almost unheard of in magazine comparisons, that's an absolute shame because after buying this camera I was amazed! I have many friends who are photographers and can't understand why this camera is not on the cover of any digital magazines or at the top of any camera comparisons.  Unfortunately many people will buy whats advertised the most. Hey HP......... adveritise this baby........ it's the best camera on the market and nobody knows! I'm glad I took a chance at an unadvertised camera......you will be too. Dennis..... A very happy HP C618 camera owner :)",".

WE TOOK A SAMPLE TO EACH STORE WE VISITED AND TOLD EACH SALESPERSON \"THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO TAKE PICTURES OF, PLEASE SHOW US A CAMERA THAT WILL DO IT\".  MUCH TO OUR DISMAY, NOT A SINGLE SALESPERSON COULD SUGGEST WHAT WE NEEDED; ACTUALLY MOST OF THEM COULD NOT EVEN TURN THE CAMERAS ON!!  WHEN WE SAT BACK AND REVIEWED ALL THE DISCUSSIONS AND INFO WE GLEANED FROM THESE STORE VISITS, WE FELT WE NEEDED A CAMERA WITH AT LEAST 2 MEGAPIXELS AND A 2X OR 3X OPTICAL ZOOM FOR THE CLOSEUP WORK THAT WAS PART OF OUR REQUIREMENT AND IF WE FOUND A CAMERA THAT COULD HANDLE THE CLOSEUPS, THE REMAINDER WOULD BE A NO BRAINER. HAVING HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE USING HP EQUIPMENT(COMPUTERS,GAS CHROMATOGRAPHS,AND VARIOUS TEST EQUIPMENT) WE FELT IF HP PUT THEIR NAME ON IT THEN IT HAD TO BE BETTER THAN MOST, SO THE HP618 WAS OUR FINAL CHOICE(OUR PURCHASE CAME WITH A 30-DAY RETURN POLICY). WE FELT THAT WITHIN A WEEK WE WOULD KNOW IF THE CAMERA WOULD DO OUR JOBS AND HOW TO USE IT.  WELL, WITHIN AN HOUR AFTER RECEIVING THE CAMERA, LOADING THE SOFTWARE ON THE PC, AND READING THE SHORT \"HOW TO GET GOING\" BOOKLET, WE WERE TAKING PICTURES LIKE A PRO!! THIS CAMERA CAN DO IT ALL!  SINCE MOST OF OUR WORK IS INSIDE, WE BOUGHT A POWER ADAPTOR, A MUST!","After agonizing for weeks over what camera to buy, and coming THIS CLOSE to buying the Olympus C-2040, I decided on the HP 618. I liked the idea of HP technology combined with a Pentax lens. Just received it yesterday, and boy am I impressed! The HP technology is very intuitive, so figuring out how the camera works is not difficult. Lots of settings available for photo buffs, but can operate on a simple point-and-shoot basis, too. Shot-to-shot times are fast, and there's very little shutter lag. Picture quality seems terrific so far, but I haven't tested it under too many conditions yet.<br />Two nice included bonuses are a 16 MB CompactFlash card and a very simple, one-button infrared remote control. The accessory kit (right now, offered FREE with purchase of camera, if you buy direct from HP) is a great deal, too. It contains another 16 MB card, a leather case, and eight lithium batteries, among other things.<br />Can you tell I'm excited about this camera? Highly recommended!<br />Oh yes, the only difference between the C-618 and the C-618xi is the software that is included.  The cameras are identical.<br />One additional purchase I would recommend is a CompactFlash card reader to help preserve battery life.  ... ...<br />(No, I don't work for HP!)","This camera rocks.  Great quality and is a breeze to use.  There are 2 items you will need.  1. the power adapter and 2. rechargeable batteries.

Also the flash needs help in very low light situations - like dark smoke residue rooms.

I didn't want to put out too much money on this camera, yet I didn't want to chintz on the technical aspect.  Another reason I bought this camera is because Sony is one of the few (if not the only) manufacturer to say in its sales pitch that their camera does MPEGs...and in comparison tables, not all digicams make MPEGs.  As with a lot of new digital devices, there are almost too many bells & whistles built-in, to the point it's overwhelming.  However, with a little practice, and time spent reading the owner's manual (yes, be a nerd, and READ IT), it's quite easy to operate.  The sepia effects that are available are fantastic.  There are still a lot of features on this camera I need to explore.  One thing I have noticed on the MPEGs, is that if you double-click the filename, once you have the MPEG in/on your PC, it opens in a very small window, and the audio seems to be at double-speed.  However, when viewing with Media Player, it works fine.  Maybe it's just me. OVerall, a good camera at a good price...something in the middle of the road, but it satisfies my needs.","I purchased this little beauty 1 week prior to the Christmas since we were going for a short trip [1wk]. I've used this camera in all the modes for three weeks now at family gatherings, vacation and parties. The day after the party I up load the pictures that I took to the hosts Email for distribution. The still pictures can be taken in different levels of image size 1280x960,1280(3:2),1028x768,640x480 and Movie 320x240, 160x112 for (up to 1 minute w/sound).<br />This Sony is my first \"Digital Camera\"...I have taken approx. 300 pictures in the last 3 weeks. Instant \"LED\" viewing is perfect for capturing \"GOOD pictures\" as you can delete bad ones right away. Don't loose the instruction book. The \"LED\" menus are simple but their are a lot of them.<br />The MVC-FD85 is advertised as a \"Still Camera\", personally I have used it for everything but a tipod!","I bought the Sony Mavica FD85 as a Christmas gift to myself.  So far I couldn't be happier.  After much reading about digital camera's I knew I wanted this camera.  It seemed to me that using a floppy was much easier than having to hook up cables.  And it's a breeze to view the pictures I've taken !  The FD85 has an easy to understand menu that pops up on the LCD screen.  The mini movie feature is fun to play around with too.  Some folks talk about it's bulky size because of using a floppy disk to store the images, but it's no bigger than my Pentax K1000 35mm camera and lighter in weight.  And I don't have to drop everything to change to my zoom lens as with my Pentax.  One thing I didn't care for is the ArcSoft PhotoStudio software included with the camera.  It's cheap and very hard to adjust your pictures.  I never did get a decent photo printed out using that software.  So, I started using my Adobe PhotoDeluxe and it works great !  The pictures I've printed out have been of good quality and suitiable  for framing.  The only reason I didn't give this camera a 5 star rating was because I've only had it a week.  I will post another review after I've used it for several months.  In a nutshell, this was a great gift to myself and well worth the money.","The Sony MVC-FD85 is a superb camera.  Although priced a little steep for most,  using this camera is easy enough for the most mechanically inept. An easy to read menu bar which is illuminated on the LCD ,makes for easy access to index through pictures, edit, add effects, protect or delete pictures.  The tools also allow you to select the size and quality of the pictures you want.  At the highest quality setting, 6 pictures can be stored on one 3.5 floppy disk and 30 pictures at the lowest setting. All pictures are stored in JPG format and can be later saved using the \"Monarch\" Photo Lab Application that comes with the camera. The Sony MVC-FD85 Digital Camera can be used with both PC and Macintosh formats, making it an even more attractive buy.<br />I would definitely recommend this camera for the photo/Internet enthusiast!","Ok...i reviewed every digital camera for months...and it took me to the LAST MINUTE to decide.  I was going to get the Mavica FD-71 (i believe thats the model #)...the order was all filled out then i clicked cancel bec. i wasn't sure...so i went with the better model...FD-85.  My friend has the FD-71 and i always thought it was a good camera.  Now that i have this one...i can see a HUGE DIFFERENCE in quality.  For the money it costs...GO FOR IT...you will not regret it one bit.  Take my review into great consideration...i will tell you the positives...for starters the quality is great..don't listen to any negatives about the quality because you will not be disapointed.  Next, the fact that it copys to a disk is amazing.  You can take all the pictures you want!  You can also copy the disk right there on the camera and give it to a friend.  Another amazing feature is that you can make short 15 second movies.  This is a great feauture to play around with.  It also has a audio/video out jack which allows you to use the camera to record a movie onto a VCR.  The best thing about this whole camera is the ease of use.  To be honest and straight out...an idiot can use this camera.  The menu set up and the options within the camera can be operated by a young child.  There are no cables to use and no software to load...just insert a disk and enjoy.  Sony has done it again.  All of my electronics are sony...TV, DVD, VCR, Receiver, and now camera...they are just the kings of electronics....you can't go wrong with anything they make.  Just trust me...buy this camera..spend the extra money.  Anyone who is involved with ebay should buy this for easy posting of auctions.  My #1 use is for ebay and i will make the money back in profits from ebay for the camera.","I thought I might be getting into more than I could handle easily. I am 75 yrs.(I don't like to say old)and I enjoy taking pictures of everything. WOW! was I amazed about how easy this camera is to handle. I like the size but most of all I Loooove the clarity of the pictures and the LCD viewing window with all the menu choices are a cinch to understand Email attachments are so simple..and just think.no more waiting to develope film. Take the shot.put the floppy in your pc drive..and the photo is off to the kids or on a card or a letter.Works great with MS Word.","I have been using this camera for work and have been so impressed with how easy it is to use.  I want one for at home now!","I spent hours and hours on the internet and in stores looking at digital cameras and reading about them before I finally bought the Mavica 85.  It's even better than I thought it would be.  The floppy drive can use either 3.5\" floppies or the Sony Memory Sticks.  All work really well.  Ikelite even makes an underwater housing for this camera, but it costs more than the camera does.  The quality of the pictures, ease of operation, myriad of functions this camera has are just awesome.  We love this camera.  The pricing seems a bit steep, but, when we compared the Sony to all the other cameras, it did seem in line.","I had tried out the FD73 and found the picture quality lacking.  The FD83 takes pictures that are much better.  I love being able to use floppies to record images... it's so wonderful to not have to use some cable or anything else to retrieve your pictures... just pop your disk into your computer and get started!<br />I also love the video feature... I can take short little videos of my kids and email them to the grandparents who live elsewhere.  It's like giving them a chance to see their grandkids every day.  This camera is soooooo easy to use.  And when you use it, everybody says, \"Wow!  That's so cool!\"  And they want to know all about it, how much it cost, etc.<br />The only flaw I've found: I do find that when I put the camera on the highest quality settings, I can only get about 6 pictures per floppy disk (yesterday's technology) which is somewhat annoying.  At some point, I will probably invest in the Smart/Memory Stick (tomorrow technology) and an adaptor which will allow me to take tons of pictures at one setting.<br />I really love this camera... a great investment!","This is a perfect camera -- finally!  In the past 2-3 years, Ihad been spending $... per roll of 24 pics in APS format, having thepictures developed, sent to me in an e-mail, and recorded on a CD.Last year alone, I practically paid for this camera.  It uses a diskfor recording the pictures; I delete the pics I don't want.  I get aperfectly acceptable picture from ordinary (cheap) printer paper.  Mypurpose in buying the camera is to photograph items for presenting onEbay auctions.  I had heard from at least two other individuals whoregularly run auctions, that this little camera does beautifulcloseups.  However, it was so easy to operate when I openend ittonight that I couldn't resist photographing all the rooms in ourhouse for insurance inventory purposes, too.  And to think I don'thave to spend any more money in developing costs.  Most of my friendshave e-mail, and we just e-mail the pics back and forth.<br />Poor filmmanufacturer's will go broke if this idea catches on!","Well I broke down and bought this camera.  I was going to buy the model  under it that only records 640 x 480 but I am glad I didn't now.  The  difference in recording at 1.3 megapix versus 640x480 is very noticable.  If you just want a basic camera, go for the lesser model but if you are  already spending that much, go ahead and chunck down the extra 200 bucks,  it is very well worth it.  This camera is very easy to use.  I love the  fact that you can record on floppies.  NO need to install software or  cabels.  I use this camera at work which is why I got the floppy drive on a  digital camera.  People need pics taken of different things, you take them,  just hand them the disk when you are finished, no need to run to a computer  to download then transfer to disk.  The drive writes really quickly on this  camera, so hardly no waiting at all.  Also love the fact of it having a  rechargeable battery.  It uses the same battery as my sony handcam so I  actually have two batteries and they use the same charger, so that was an  added bonus.  The battery charges in about 20 minutes to full capacity and  lasts about 60 pictures before needing charging.  I did have a minolta  digital camera without the floppy and the recharagable batteries and I tell  you, it was eating those AA batteries up fast.  So I am very satisfied with  this product.","I would give this camera a 5 star but this technology has so much more to  grow with.  I love the fact you can take a photo and just stick it in your  A drive and wah lah!  Instant emailed photos to all your friends and  family.  The menu tool on the display monitor is very easy to use with very  little confusion.  It almost felt like second nature pressing all the  buttons to take me where I wanted to go.  Unfortunately the price leaves  little to be desired.  I imagine that digital cameras will be the big hit  this Christmas season, so, wait for these products to go down in price a  little before buying such a major purchase.  If you check out my previous  reviews I made a review about the Panasonic portable DVD player and the  price of that item in October 1999 was $1100.00, I think it's probably  under that figure now.  The utmost thing to do with products like this is  COMPARE PRICES!  Check out other online stores as well as Amazon and check  out other electronics stores to get the best deal possible.  It's worth the  time and you can compare all products to see which one is right for you.  Cheers!","Digital will soon drop off the reference to these types of cameras. With this camera the world can see what I see. I don't even own a computer (why bother, use is free at my public library) but I can view my images even  MOVIES stored on a standard 3-1/2\" floppy disk and with free e-mail  and web pages my eyes are available to the world for only the one time cost  of this great Sony camera!","The FD-85 is an excellent choice for a balance of great options and capabilities for price.  Its 1.3 mega pixel resolution provides for good crisp pictures.  It also has a nice 6x zoom (3x optical).  I prefer using  only optical zoom and 3x is a sufficient zoom for most applications.  But,  the best thing is the floppy drive.  No more cables and slow transfers.  It  especially comes in handy when visiting relatives and friends.  You can  download copies to their PC without having to carry around cables or  installing software on their computer.  This cam does not have the highest  of todays mega pixel rating nor zoom, but if you want some of the high end  options without the high end prices, this camera is a definate must have.","This is the best camera1 there are so mnay fetures! you can take pics right on a floppy! it is so easy to use and has a great price!","The Mavica line of cameras are easy to use and that is their forte.  With the floppy disk access you're loosing somewhat on storage capacity (or the need to carry several floppies with you), but then, just pop it in and  done.  The viewer is high quality \"real-time\" LCD display, unlike  some that are jittery, or feel like slow-motion movie.<br />The ability to  take MPEG clips is very attractive. I found that short MPEG clips are  sometimes more enjoyable to watch then going through your camcorder library  while reviewing your your family archives.<br />They could be cheaper, though."]},{"name":"Sony Mavica FD-90","amazon_reviews":["thanks","too hard to find floppy's for it, but it works great.

We  loved  it  so  much  that  we  are  in  the  process  of  buying  one  for  our  own  personal  use.  I  would  highly  recommend  this  camera  to  anybody!  Chris","I was enjoying my FD-90 and the combined convenience and hassle of having it record images onto a floppy disk (convenient in that you can easily transfer images to the computer--hassle in that you are constantly changing floppies), but now I love it. I purchased a Memory Stick and adaptor. Now, I can shoot away and not worry about having to change the diskette after every fifth shot. I also purchased a Sony photo printer for the computer. I am even more pleased with the camera now that I can get almost \"lab-quality\" photos from my home computer.","I've reviewed several digital cameras and one thing that most users all recommended that I have is USB Port connection. This camera seems excellent in every other category. Is it an oversite or is there a better way of communicating with ones computer?","We bought this camera and the starter kit (extra higher capacity battery and carrying case) in time for a weeklong family vacation.  After shooting 2000 pictures and 200 video clips on $15 worth of floppy diskettes during the trip, I want to say this is a great camera.  The film developing costs saved on this trip alone could have paid for the camera!<br />The mpeg movies are a great feature.<br />I almost settled for the FD85, I'm glad we didn't because of extra features gained.  This camera is smaller and cheaper than the FD95, and smaller than our \"good\" SLR - but a bit bigger than the average point and shoot.<br />The FD90 works completely auto with the full range of point and shoot features found on our similarly priced SLR, or you can \"cursor\" through the on-screen menus and set a number of options including exposure and white balance. The \"AE program button\" allows you to quickly select \"twilight mode\", \"twilight plus mode\", \"landscape mode\", \"panfocus mode\" or \"spot light-metering mode\".  The camera has a manual focus ring if you need to use it, and the flash can be set auto, manual on, manual off, or redeye. The camera also has a macro mode. I'm not a professional photographer, so I found myself playing with the manual settings learning what makes for a good photograph.  It is great getting instant feedback on the digital screen. If it didn't work, I just reviewed, deleted and tried again - something I've longed for using our SLR. This camera is as fun as it is useful!  The FD90 is an easy point and shoot - or if you want, you can control some of the action if you are just willing to read the manual and learn the controls.  The camera is capable of more than just point and shoot, but the controls are unique.<br />Did I mention that this camera can also record short videos?<br />No hassle floppy diskettes are almost free these days and are available almost everywhere, only Mavica cameras write directly to them.  Great feature when vacation down south got extended unexpectedly in winter months due to bad weather canceling flights back north. Windows 98/ME/2000 PC users don't need any additional software to view the pictures stored on the floppies - the camera creates an HTML page right on the diskette linking pictures and movies for easy viewing. There is also a freeware utility floating around the Internet specifically written for Mavica owning PC users that will thumbnail your shots if you are into quick website creations.<br />You can zoom into and crop pictures, copy and format diskettes, etc. right on the camera so you don't need a PC to enjoy this camera - especially with the supplied cable that plugs directly into composite inputs on your Television/VCR. Regarding the resolution, I take most of my pictures on the lowest resolutions and they are still good - they print 3 x 5 no problem, even larger with very little distortion. On screen (or my TV with the supplied cable) they are great at the wimpy 640 x 480, especially with the camera in slide-show mode. Plug the camera into a VCR directly and set it on a tripod at family or church events and you have an extra camcorder! It's when you try to \"blow up\" a picture, or digitally zoom into a recorded shot that the extra pixels matter.<br />I did take 20 or 30 pictures at higher resolutions, but rarely the highest.  After visiting with friends who are digital camera owners, a few with 2 mega pixel and higher possibilities, I'm hard pressed to believe most of us care for more than a mega pixel, as evidenced by the popularity of the Mavica FD73 that doesn't even have the ability.  If you are a true photography buff/professional, or have some specialized business need for super clarity, I can see the mega requirement. If you rarely venture beyond 200 speed 35mm film in your SLR, and you rarely deviate from dropping your film off at the local supermarket for developing doubles on 4 x 6 with an index print, lets be realistic. For me the pictures are for memories rather than for artistic impression, and with this camera I get hundreds where I used to get dozens. With the manual features I can tinker with art when so inclined. I almost forgot to mention the solarize, B&W, Sepia, and Neg.Art effects.<br />Why not perfect?  Well, the shutter hesitation does take some getting used to, and the camera seems to struggle a bit in low lighting - although I'm not convinced I just haven't learned how to manually compensate with so many available options. I believe there is also an optional external flash. Lenses, external charger(s), memory sticks etc. are also available for this camera at an additional cost.<br />Oh, ya, this camera makes MPEG movies, up to 60 sec of audio/video per 1.44 diskette in the low-res mode!<br />We researched several cameras, and I am very pleased with this purchase.  I think the Mavica FD90 has the best mix/compromise of digital camera features.  For me the FD90 has set the standard for all others to compare.  Sony has done it right.","Please be sure to read everyones reviews, I have found all of the items pointed out below to be true.<br />Great things about this camera:  1. the zoom, if you take pictures of horses, this lens is a nessesity to take decent quality pictures, stand way back and zoom in a bit to make the horse look proportional... otherwise they look like mules. You don't find this zoom on all digital cameras.<br />2. The save/display with floppies is much faster than with the memory stick.. memory stick is hands down better for taking a bunch of pictures, but if you are in a quick moving situation, switch to the floppies, and expect 6-10 pictures per disk on a medium resolution.<br />4. Love the mini movies you can do with this camera. 5. Love the easy to use features, easy to turn the flash on and off, and easy to try and help get better pictures in low light conditions.<br />6. Yes, it does take 4-5 minutes to download the memory stick pictures... but as someone that has spent HOURS scanning a 24 roll of regular film, this is really no big deal.<br />7. I am an advanced amature in the 35mm format and I love this digital camera, I still went ahead and bought an Elan II (wow is it neat!) and they both have their advantages and disadvantages.<br />I would definitly buy another one.","In October 1997 I purchased one of the first versions of the Sony Mavica camera -- the FD7 model -- and I have replaced it with the FD90 model.  The main reasons I purchased this camera was 3.5\" storage and the versatility of the 'jpeg' files in Windows-based software.  While easy to understand HOW to use, the camera itself is awkard WHEN used (especially compared to the FD7) as you need to use the same hand to grip the camera and work the controls.  The 'mpeg' movie feature is a definitive plus!","I bought this Mavica after using a friends older FD88. I have always been a big fan of the Mavica and its unique 3.5' drive but after having this camera for 3 months now I am pretty disappointed. The picture quality even on the highest setting is very poor compared to other digital cameras in this price range. The color is poor on all settings. 1.3 Megapixels is old news, not something you would want to spend 700 bucks on when you can get a Olypus 3.3 megapixel for that much. The Olympus I just bought makes the mavica seem like a toy, the color a clarity is unreal. I enjoyed the mavica for the 3.5 drive and its no fuss nature but now that I know what else can be had for the same money and giving up a perk the Mavica is on the shelf for my kid to use.","I hemmed and hawed for quite a while before making the plunge to buy a digital camera.  I wanted something to use for online auctions, and take pix to use on my web site.  I had been taking analog pix, getting them developed, scanning them, and tossing them in a box.  I was going to get the FD-73, but decided I might want higher resolution, so I stepped up to the FD-90.  Wow!  The #1 selling point for me was the floppy disk storage; friends of mine have cameras with cables and whatnot, and it seems like a big pain.  I like not being tied to a proprietary hardware and software interface.  I can take pix in the car, and unload them at home, work, or at a friend's house.  If I need more \"film\" I can stop at any supermarket or office supply store and pick up a box of floppies.  Just this weekend, I took some pix of a car that a friend was selling, then just handed him the floppy to take home and upload to his own computer.  Now the kicker: this camera has MPEG movie capability, which I wrote off as a \"well, that's cool, but I probably won't use it\" feature.  I couldn't have been more wrong - that's the coolest thing about this camera!  In addition to the pix I took of the car, I also created a \"walk-around\" video as well! Downsides?  The zoom control is kinda awkward being on the front; they should have left it on the back, so you could work it with your thumb while working the shutter.  It takes a great deal of dexterity to work the zoom while shooting a movie.  The camera should also ship with the longer-life battery that's available as an option.  And they should ship some sort of protective case with it.","I bought the Mavica fd90 about 2 months ago, and I must say that I'm quite pleased with my purchase. I recently moved to a foreign country, and this has been the ideal way for me to document my stay here - as well as have the opportunity to share all of my photos with family and friends via e-mail. A cd-rw drive allows me to save on disk space, if that is worrysome for anyone.... I read one review that stated that the camera only took 15 second movies - NOT TRUE. If you merely hold the button down longer, you can fit a 60 second movie on a 1.44 mg disk. I don't know what the capabilities are if you have the memory card, but it would be worth investigating! If you've been searching for a great camera that takes beautiful quality photos, look no further!","This camera is your best bet if you are purchasing a digital camera for a school because of its ease of use and portability. Teachers check this camera out from our circulation and turn the camera back in....meanwhile they have the floppy in their classroom or at home manipulating their pictures while the camera can be checked out to someone else! No down time with this camera while it sits in a teacher's classroom connected to a cable waiting for her to have time to upload the pictures to her computer...at school or at home. And soooo easy to use....all of my teachers know how to retrieve information from the A drive. The kids love the instant gratification of seeing the pictures printed when they come back from lunch....it is that easy. The only downside, that I have yet to figure out, is the pause when it takes the picture. When the button is pressed there is a 2 second or so pause until the picture actually captures, so you may not be getting the picture that you thought you were getting. But that would not stop me from buying another one for our school!","I bought this Camera about 9 months ago. I have been taking lots pictures. I am very pleased with the quality of pictures. The camera is very easy to use. I recommend this camera over anything out there at this point.","After using the Mavica MVC-FD90 for several months, sending it back to Sony and carrying on a lengthy dialog with them, I can truthfully say, it's not worth the money.  Of course the bells and whistles are OK, the MPEG's are fine and it takes great pictures at maximum resolution.  There is no reason for it to even have the 640 X 480 or email resolutions, the pictures are horrible. In those resolutions, the subject has a \"halo\" around it or them, the faces looked wrinkled and the picture is of overall poor quality.  After sending it back to Sony, they returned it saying that was just the way it worked.  Further, I use the memory stick and it takes forever to load a picture and transferring 70 or 80 pictures from the disk to the computer hard drive takes 4 to 5 minutes. Folks, this camera is just plain clunky and there are many digital cameras out there at half the price that will do as good or better of a job.  Caveat Emptor!!!!","The FD-90 is a fine camera.I have owned the FD-81 and the FD-88 and they were also excellent.In fact they were totally trouble free. However the FD-90 had a few problems and had to be sent in for Warranty Repair. In the first 3 months that I owned the camera it went in 3 times for the same repair and I lost nearly all summer (50+ days) to take photos. Sony Warranty Service stinks! I'm sure that now that you have read this you will not be so anxious to purchase the FD-90, but outside of the fact that my camera had a problem they could or would not quickly repair, now that I have it back it is everything that I wanted. Take the time to read all of the reviews and you will agree that this is one heck of a camera..","I'm an avid photographer and run hundreds of websites. I went into the market several years ago for a digital camera to easily email photos to friends and family, and to take photos for the websites I run. Since then I have bought several Sony Mavica cameras, each better than the last!<br />The FD90 is simply great - easy to use for beginners, and full of features for advanced users. The floppy disk system is INCREDIBLY useful - you go to someone's house and simply hand them the disk when you're done taking pictures of the birthday or anniversary. No special cables, no bizarre devices necessary. You *always* have floppies available somewhere to buy, even on vacation.<br />Short MPEGs are fantastic too - there are many times that I've been at a zoo or event and just wanted to take a short clip to show how something moved, or to get a kiss or something. It's perfect!<br />If you're in the market for a new digital camera, I'd recommend this one with no reservations.","This was my 2nd digital camera, and it is so much better than the last one.  The last one I had was a Sony MVC-FD73.  It was OK but this one is  better and it is almost the same price as the MVC-FD73 (on Amazon that is).  There is one feature that soars above the other cameras, which is the  floppy disk \"and\" memory stick capability.  The one bad thing is  that the LCD, in bright light, the screen, and it doesn't have a regular  view finder, is kid of hard to see.  Other than that, there is nothing  wrong with the amazingly easy to use Mavica FD90.  Thanks for reading my  review!","I have just upgraded to the Sony Mavica FD90 and I love it!  This is my  third digital camera. My last one was the Sony FD73 and, while it took  absolutely incredible close-up shots, the lack of resolution was a  shortcoming for me.  The FD90 is three times the camera that the FD73 was!  Clear, clean shots and macro ability that is just incredible.  It's a  keeper! Was almost overwhelmed when I saw the buttons & choices on the  back, but I started using it easily before even opening the book. Then I  got into the book and found all kinds of cool things the camera does!  It's  a lot of camera for the price in my book.","fd-90 is my first digital camera and it's the most wonderfull and easy to use camera. I was using the camera within minutes of unpacking it. the  battery comes pre-charged. click & delete pics if you don't  like.<br />Good things include  1. a floppy drive 2. memory stick capability  and wonderfull resolution. 3. email mode saves additional smaller 10k  images.<br />minor irritants include  1. No viewfinder 2. Delay between the  click and save of the picture. 3. Cannot take more than 4 high resolution  pics per floppy.  4. Even with memory stick, it cannot record longer mpeg  movies.<br />The memory stick is an absolute must to enjoy this camera!","I own the model that the FD 90 replaced, the FD88 and I have been using it for about a year. I feel I can review the FD90 because it is so similar to  the FD88,  and is an improvement over mine in a few important respects. The  cameras are identical otherwise, except that Sony has made the FD90 into  1.6 megapixel instead of 1.3. This increases the resolution for larger  prints and when you compress them (say to e-mail), they won't be grainy.  Sony has also added their memory stick capability - a great feature. Let me  tell you about my FD88 and since the FD90 is even better, you can judge for  yourself. The Sony Mavica FD88 is a terrific digital camera, especially for  someone new to the genre and not necessarily extremely Computer literate.  It takes great shots and the floppy disk storage medium is very easy to use  and download to your PC. While its rated 1.3 million pixels is not as high  as some other high level models from other manufacturers, in reality not  too many people are going to appreciate much of a difference; the pictures  look great, crystal clear, and very professional. Since the FD90 is  improved in several respects over an already terrific camera, including  somewhat higher resolution (1.6 million pixels), the FD90 has to be a real  winner. The memory stick capability is an added bonus - especially if you  buy the memory stick-floppy disk converter. Then you can store literally  dozens of shots. Well worth the price.","I own the MVC FD-88, which was the camera model just before the FD-90.  I have to say I prefer the FD-88, which is unfortunate as Sony seems to have  just stopped making it.<br />My major beefs with the FD-90 are first that you  can only recharge the battery in the camera.  This really stinks.  I hate  having to place an expensive piece of equipment on a shelf while it acts as  a $20 battery charger.  What a waste.  The FD-88 came with a nice seperate  charger, which actually took up LESS room than the equipment included with  the FD-90, and you could go out and take pictures with a second battery  while the first charged.  Can't do that any more.<br />Secondly, the FD-90  pauses and freezes the image while you're focusing to shoot, which is  really disorienting to me.  Not to mention it doesn't get the fine-tuning  in auto-focus on close-up subjects, even using the Macro option.  I was  really disapponted in that.<br />I've used the FD-88 a lot, and the FD-90 was  a new toy to try out (my company bought it).  I would have to say that I  would wait on buying this camera until the \"nest best thing\" came  out.","This camera is another great Sony product in my book.  It supports a wide range of resolutions as well as two MPEG recording sizes (320x200 and 160x100).  It can record sound along with a snap shot.  It has four special effects: solarize, b&w, sepia, and negative art.  With the optional  MSAC-FD2M floppy addapter you can use Sony's memory sticks to store even  more images.<br />I can go on and on about the feature set for this camera,  but I don't have the time.  If you are looking for a high quality digital  camera that takes sharp pictures then give this one a try.<br />This camera is  very flexible and is definitely worth the money.","What i luv about the camera is the high resolution, clear images, and the sound recording.","I am a beginner and have had the camera for about 1 week. Can acquire awsome photographs. I plan on using the camera for acquiring copies of text documents and photographs. It is next to impossible to carry a 'scanner'  with you on your genealogy trips. So far the only problem I have with  acquiring these copies is the reflection from the itmes being copied. Have  to get at an angle that results in some ampount of distortion but by taking  a little time good copies can be obtained. I do like the camera very much.","I am a first time user of a digital camera and I am awed by the outstanding quality of the pictures and the simple use of the camera.  I reviewed quite a few different companies and cameras before settling on the  Sony FD-90.  Originally one of my criteria was size.  Yes the Sony FD-90 is  a little bulky because of the standard floppy drive but all in all it is  just a little bigger then an ordinary 35mm camera and is probably lighter  in weight.  I use my FD-90 for work (and for play) and one of the features  I enjoy is being able to make copies of the disks on the spot and to hand  them out to other people at meetings.  The floppy disk makes this camera  absolutely simple to use.  Shoot a picture and put the disk in your  computer and the picture is there as quick as your computer can access the  floppy drive.  No cables to hook up!  I have not used the new Memory Stick  with this camera although it is an available option.  For the price of  floppies I don't foresee needing anything else. I had considered the Sony  FD-88 but I saw a lot of reviews complaining about red eye in the pictures.  I was pleased to find on this FD-90 there is a red eye reduction feature  built into the flash and it actually works. Another feature I like is the  MPEG capability.  For me this feature is basically a toy and is really only  useful for placing small MPEG movies on a web site or for emailing. From  what I've seen in reviews of other cameras is that there is a problem with  battery consumption.  With the FD-90 you get a lithium ion battery and a  charger so there will be no problem with that.  I've been getting a full  hour of shots with a full charge.  Consider all the functions like flash  and zoom and these use battery life so an hour is pretty good.  I bought a  spare battery as well but so far have not had to use it. Overall I would  recommend this digital camera for everybody.  From the box it is very  simple to use.  You'll be up and running as soon as you get the battery  charged (you can read the manual while it's charging) and you'll be having  fun with this camera in no time at all.","The Sony MVC-FD90 is an excellent camera that offers the user many features. 1. 16X Zoom which is competive with film cameras. 2. MPEG that is sharp and clear. 3. Sound pickup that is very accurate and clear. 4.  Ability to take close ups less than 2 in.","The best part of this camera is the storage being normal floppies, making the transfer to the PC very easy and convinient. Make duplicates and format floppies using the camera.  The video is great, but rather short. Single floppy can hold max of approx 15seconds. Digital Zoom 16X is more then  adequate for a day to day camera user. All in all a pretty good camera, yet  another mark left in the camera world by Sony. ..."]},{"name":"Toshiba PDR-M60","amazon_reviews":["I think that the PDR-M60 is a great camera for anyone who wants a digital camera without all of the extravagant features.

But its an all around great camera. Oh and new lenses coming out as well.","I purchased my camera a few weeks ago and rapidly came to realize what other reviewers before me had.  Rechargable batteries and a larger smartmedia card are absolutley necessary, but also well worth the few xtra bucks.  I couldn't find a compareable camera for the same price.  Very easy to use with some experimenting.  I find the picture quality to be very good at the higher settings.  Prints are almost indistinguishable from 35mm photos.  I love it more every day.  Get yours today, don't hesitate.","I bought this camera refurbished and let me tell you it works GREAT!!! You have to get NiMh batteries. They lasted me over 4 days of taking pictures on vacation. The camera has been sitting for over a week and the batteries are still good. The only other thing you need to get is a higher capacity memory card 32Mb or 64Mb. You can take plenty of pictures at the BEST resolution.(about 1meg/pic.)<br /> I printed my pictures at home on a Epson Stylus Photo 870 and you can't tell them appart from 35mm pictures. Plus you only print the good ones, you crop out unwanted items and you can do digital editing!<br /> The only problem I could find was the lower left corner of the view finder was blocked by the lens frame.

I have not taken a bad picture yet.I would invest in at least a 32 MG card to hold more pictures,I bought a 64MG and stopped taking shots at 50 on high resolution.I would also invest in some rechargable batterys,I got about 15 pictures plus downloading with the batterys that came with the camera which is more than the other reviews got.Turning off the camera after each photo and not using the LCD helps alot.Downloading is quick with the USB cable.","I bought my camera and used up my batteries in minutes. I then went out and bought two sets of NiMh and a charger. Also, a 32mb Smart media card. I was disappointed that my USB controller won't recognize the camera so I had to buy a flashpath adapter. The additional items I needed ran the cost up by approx. $.... I still don't have an AC adapter. There is a battery pack that last 5 hours with the LCD display being on for the whole time. Buy it from......<br />After all of the additional expenses, I used the camera and was really delighted with the results. It is very easy to use and I don't mind having the manual on disk. I also can get up to 450 shots on the 32mb memory. I think I will only use the full, fine setting if I want enlargments. I currently load the pictures I take into the computer then use my CD writer and FlipAlbum software to create an album on CD. It works great. Try it.","We received this as a Christmas gift from several relatives and have been fairly pleased with its overall performance. It takes AA batteries and I've found that they get chewed up fast if 1) you use the LCD screen to take pictures instead of the viewfinder and 2) you leave it attached to the computer while in \"transfer\" mode after the pictures have been transfered (e.g. if you transfer pics and forget to turn it off). The recommendation by another user to buy rechargeable batteries is a good one. That's what we do. When I do the above, using NiMH batteries, the charge lasts quite awhile.<br />In my opinion, the picture quality is very good. .... I was very surprised, in looking back at older scanned pictures, at the incredible difference in quality and compression. We've printed some 1792x1200 pictures on 4x6 glossy paper and they really look like photos! We are currently awaiting professional prints of many of the pictures blown up to 8x10.<br />For how much we've used the camera, and the wonderful results, and the price, we are extremely pleased. We've taken over 1000 pictures in 4 months. I would not be brave enough to take that many in my lifetime with a standard SLR camera.<br />UPDATE 5/13/2002<br />I'm raising my review to 5 stars.  We've had the camera for over a year now and it's still our primary camera.  This has been an exceptional investment, especially since Smartmedia cards are dirt cheap.  At the highest resolution & highest quality, a 64MB memory card holds over 100 pictures.  We've probably taken at least 3000 pictures in the 1½ years we've owned it.  All the pictures from last year are archived on 2 CDs.  There is another great feature that--it takes 16 pictures in 4 seconds and displayes all 16 in a grid on one image.  I use imaging software to automatically chop them up and splice them into a mini-animation.  If I were in the market now, I would probably buy this used, unless the price becomes a little more competitive.","I bought a Toshiba PDR-M60 three days ago. At first I was disappointed because I used 12 batteries in half a day, including the alkaline batteries that are supplied but are pretty much useless. The instruction manual is so brief that it provides only the most basic information, but the 322 page manual that comes with the installation of the software is much more helpful. You just need time to read it. On the second day I went back to the store where I purchased the camera and picked up a larger capacity Smart Card, a recharger and some rechargable batteries. Although the store carried the camera, it did not carry an adapter for it so I am still looking. I would advise purchasing all of these products at the same time as you get the camera. It will save a lot of headaches and a lot money in spent batteries.","I have nearly two months experience with the product. By now I am very much satisfied with the product. Here are the important features:<br />1. Need of manual: If you have a some experience with photography you need not even have to read the manual. It is so user friendly, with self-explanatory controlls.<br />2. Clarity: Not so good, but comparable to other 2.1 mpixel images of others.<br />3. Power: I don't know, as I have rechargeable. It never finished while taking photos. (I took at least 40 images in a stretch, without recharging).<br />4. Image downloading: I faced some problems with USB, as my OS was windows 95. But it drives itself fine in windows 2000. Also the speed is good, 32 MB may take a 2-3 min.<br />Of course, memory 4MB is too small to use. It may be appropriate to get 16/32 smartmedia. Also recharger also is a standard requirement. Still the camera is a good value pick ....","Hi:  yes i purchased the toshiba pdr-m60 camera .  At first I didn't like it... it turned out that the batterys were only good for a few dozen pictures and that was it.  So I got a set of recdhargeable ni mh batterys.  Well let me tell you that changed my whole view to the camera  You must get a bigger smartmedia card becuase you can sure take more pictures than you have space  evry time.  I have used a lot of camera over the past years. And find that if you want to take good pitures get to know your camera ...take hundreds od pictures of nothing but stuff that interests you.,  than look at other pictures of the same subjects.. So you will see What you want and get better at taking pictures as you go .  Excellent pix every time.","So far the pictures I've taken, although few once the batteries ran out, were great, but heh, where is the manual with all the instructions?  What came with the camera is not what I'd call a manual.  I spent many hours guessing the hook up process, plugging in the two cords that come with it, and basically figuring it out on my own.  I'm still not sure what goes where (it would be nice to print the pictures some day, the pictures look pretty good on the camera), so any inspirations on that subject would be greatly appreciated.  I learned more about this camera reading reviews on the other Toshiba cameras.  Help!  And that's my review.  I'll update it when I figure out how to use it.","I received this camera as an out-of-left-field Christmas gift; it was totally unexpected and I was thrilled. The thrill abated a bit when the supplied alkaline batteries went dead after about twelve snaps and two uploads. Fresh AA's didn't restore operation. A call to Toshiba's tech line (only moderately annoying as far as typical menu-driven help lines go, and I was on hold less than a minute) revealed that I needed either an AC adapter (... accessory! No thanks) or a set of nickel-metal-hydride rechargeables. I chose the latter; a trip to the local Generic Big Discount Store and ... for the batteries and charger (and an overnight initial charge) put me back in business.<br />Picture quality is good but the LCD image visibility varies widely -- from \"good\" to \"barely useable\" -- with ambient conditions. The USB upload is a snap and the software installation was easy. The optical viewfinder is a joke, though: It only approximates the picture field (conservatively; you can crop the extraneous stuff that ends up in the image) and then there's the lens housing which blocks about 20% of the finder's lower left corner.  Another dislike is the CD-ROM \"manual,\" however I enjoy a laser-printer subsidy at my place of work so making a hardcopy materially reduced my annoyance factor here.<br />In all, as a gift it's great but if you have a chance to shop for yourself there are much better cameras for not much more money.","I am surprised to here some people say they have a problem with this camers. If they do it must be they don't understand the concrpt of photography. You point and shoot, thats all. A little patients and your home free. I found it very easy to operate and got great pictures. Many were high defenition shots. This is my first digital camera and I think its great. The only thing I wish it had is a ac adapter. Only because it does use a lot of current. But to download is quick. And while at home it would be nice to use a adapter to save the batteries and not have to worry about using them up while working on a program. I recommend this camera highly!","This camera has been very easy to use and to set up. The picture quality has been excellent and I would highly recommend buying this one. I have noticed that when the camera door is not shut tight enough the battery power will shown none, but a opening and reclosing of the door always seems to restore the battery power. The instructions are easy to read and there are alot of features with this camera!","The first m60 I bought was defective right out of the box.  Would not save pictures on the 4mb card and flash never worked once.  Also AF was not working.  Took it back and got another one (same store different location) and got the 2 year extended warr.  Was a little scared about getting a second one but I like the feel and design on the m60.  Second one works great.  You have to buy NI-MH AA batteries for it.  I am having very good luck with the rechargables.  Lasting pretty long time.  Picture quality is great.  I use 800X600 res. (can do double that if you want but only 3 pictures will fit on 4mb card :() and print on a HP 882c printer.  Looks VERY good!  Camera has built in lens cap, bonus.  Has a lot of pretty advanced features for the price. (manual setting mode, macro, slow shot...)  From reading other reviews, I think 50% of these m60's made are crap and the other 50% are ok.  If your lucky to get a \"working\" model, deff. worth the money.  Great camera for someone who wants a great picture and easy to use.","First and formost, I am a real stickler for good printed manuals which the Toshiba PDR-M60 did not come with.  It was extremely basic and only the most mentally challenged users should need to deal with it.  On the other hand, the Acrobat PDF manual which was included on the CD is alot more helpful and you should defineatly check that out before trying out any one of the many features this digital camera offers.  Also, the digital camera comes shipped with the bare minmums (couple cables) and nothing else.  Not even a case.  The 4 MB SmartMedia card they provide is far too small for any extensive use so plan on purchasing an upgrade soon.  Additionally, the included Toshiba software cannot compare to what Canon provides with their Digital Elph series.<br />Aside from those quirks, for the most part, this 2.1 megapixel camera delivers.  It doesn't look or feel \"cheap\" (Olympus D460) and fits *very* nicely in your hands.  Not too big (Kodak), not too small (Elph), not too rugged or too delicate looking (Sony) - the shape is just right.  Holding the M60 will soon become 2nd nature.  The picture quality, when you properly configure and manipulate its simple AF feature, is fantastic and no one has any right to complain here. The simple point and shoot concept will appeal to casual users such as myself.<br />One major drawback to the M60 is its relatively short battery life.  Unlike Sony's or Olympus' offerings, your limited to just using 4 AA batteries.  The LCD, multi-shot, and playback mode sucks these suckers dry before you even fill up the 4 MB SmartMedia card.  Be sure to have alot of spare batteries available.<br />All in all, M60, for its price, is a good deal but you *may* want to consider looking at other cameras if you plan on using this extensively."]},{"name":"Olympus D-360L","amazon_reviews":["I had just purchased my  third Olympus one D340 R and two D360L the pace I put these cameras through , surprised me how long they lasted. the only trouble I had with the other too is a flimsily battery door latch, both finally gave way and I had to make my own door latch ;<br />I am reading  reviews on here and all state there is no zoom. the camera has one zoom on it, you hit the + and you get a zoom in on your subject. hit - and it moves to a farther out view. but with my Kodak reader I can transfer my pictures to my PC, and make them as big as I like. then I put them on DVD to make a slide show. for the money you can't beat the camera, just wish Olympus would beef up there battery door latch. The D360R I have now still works but had to make  my own latch to hold the batteries in. over all I would give it 4 and a half stars, better latch for the battery door would be a 5 star.","I bought mine just before summer 2000, and I haven't used my old 35 mm since then.  I immediately purchased a 16 MB smart media card and 4xAA NiMH w/ charger.  Downloading pix via the RS232 cable averaged about 30 s each -- painfully slow for a full memory card.  An internal card reader helped out a great deal when I upgraded to a new PC.<br /><br />Image quality is good but not great, as I always have to tweak colors with PhotoShop.  You can squeeze out decent 5x7's from the pix if you set up your shots right (can't crop them or you'll lose too much resolution); 4x6's are no problem.<br /><br />There's a bit of a learning curve to the menu, but since it's digital photography, you can practice lots and delete what you don't want.  I use mine constantly, and I even try to fill up both of my memory cards whenever I'm at a family gathering or camping or whatever holiday.<br /><br />Finally, I take all my pix at the highest JPG setting and ignore the lower resolutions; sort of a waste of time to get 1000 pix if you don't have any detail.","I was reluctant to enter the digital camera world, as I thought it would be a lot more complicated than just snapping a picture and having the film developed into pictures, so when my youngest son said I really 'needed' to get one (and he recommended the one he had..Olympus D-360L), I balked. Finally, I gave in, and how glad I am that I did. It has been a real winner in terms of ease of use and quality of pictures. Many look like a professional photographer took and developed them. For those who want great pictures and ease of use at a really bargain price, this is the camera for you. Most of us don't want pictures larger then 5 X 7, so why pay for more megapixels that you don't need? I also bought a 64 and a 128MB SmartCard, and have more than enough storage for vacations. Highly recommend.","i thought it was a great camera it works great easy 2 use batteries last for a whole day unless using lcd screen. takes bout 5 sec. to write a pic. w/ 16mb card can take about 230 normal quality pics / 75 high quality / 30 super high quality.","We are an EBAY Powerseller bookstore and I have run our auctions for two years. I have taken thousands of pictures EACH WEEK with this camera and it is a true workhorse. It is my personal camera as well. So I tend to hook-up and unhook-up this camera daily - and I've experienced zero problems.<br />I download pictures at a high speed using a ZIO card reader and it's always flawless. I use an iMac at home and a normal PC at work - and it works great with both. I use a 64mb Viking Components SmartMedia card and it can hold 292 high quality, under 350k pictures. We actually have a different company's 5.0 mp camera at work - and it is imposible to learn and use. We gave up. But you can learn this camera in under a minute and you'll be taking great pictures instantly. We're on eBay under the seller name bookman21century - see for yourself.<br />This camera has been dropped numerous times, kicked around, loaded and unloaded daily - it has literally gone through the fires of Mt. Doom - and yet is still performs brilliantly. Sure the battery life is poor, but we use a power cord at work at that works great. And sure these newer cameras have many more mega-pixels - but this camera at 1.3 has worked so fine that it's all we need, or will need, for our home and business. So, I'd recommend this for any high-volume auction user. You open the shutter, aim, and press the button. I will always, always, always stick to Olympus for its ease of use, its durable quality, its toughness, and its adaptability. If you are taking 10,000 or 100,000 pictures - this workhorse is more than up to the task!","I'VE USED THIS CAMERA FOR EXTENSIVE ONLINE AUCTIONS, WITH OVER 65,000 PHOTOS TAKEN IN NEARLY 3 YEARS...LET'S SEE YOU GET THAT MANY PHOTOS OUT OF AN EXPENSIVE 35MM NIKON FILM CAMERA BEFORE IT CRAPS THE BED..IF THIS THING EVER BREAKS DOWN, THEY SHOULD CARVE AN IMAGE OF IT ON MT.RUSHMORE, AND PUT THE THING IN THE SMITHSONIAN....","Got my tough little D-360 a year and a half ago and have ended up using it one way or another nearly every day.  I'm moving on now to a mega-mega-pix Olympus, but I won't be retiring this utilitarian tool completely; it'll be the \"guest camera\" and the loaner.  Great machine for the money. It all kind of feels like garaging the Civic for the new NS-X.<br />Anyway, the camera shows good versatility and intuitive functionality, once the modest menus are mastered.","I've purchased three of these for family- all beginners with the digitals. Everyone still has (and uses) their camera. They are compact and light. Great for emailing pictures.Use the \"high quality\" HQ setting for the ones you want to print. Prints look good, but a good printer helps. Be sure to browse the manual, but once you brush up, it's easy and fun.","The was my first digital camera and I've owned it for 3 years now.  It takes suprisingly good pictures.  It helps to understand the weaknesses of digital photography when using any digital camera.  Digital cameras will not give great rendition in low light situations.  In fact low light settings are often best handled without using the flash to avoid adding contrast to the photo.  I've seen a number of reviews where users complained about low lighting performance using the flash.  This may indicate a lack of digital camera experience.  The average in camera flash is only good within 8 feet.  This is very critical with digitals because shadow areas are digitals weak point.  Other than that caution you'll find this camera allows you to easily take great pictures.  I've often been surprised at how good the photos come out, even with this small number of pixels.  I've printed all types of photos from this camera up to 8x10 (not a recommended size).  It easily produces very good 3x5, 4x6 and 5x7 prints.  Pricing has come down on higher pixel cameras recently so this camera's price is not as attractive as it once was. ...","I had just purchased my  third Olympus one D340 R and two D360L the pace I put these cameras through , surprised me how long they lasted. the only trouble I had with the other too is a flimsily battery door latch, both finally gave way and I had to make my own door latch ;<br />I am reading  reviews on here and all state there is no zoom. the camera has one zoom on it, you hit the + and you get a zoom in on your subject. hit - and it moves to a farther out view. but with my Kodak reader I can transfer my pictures to my PC, and make them as big as I like. then I put them on DVD to make a slide show. for the money you can't beat the camera, just wish Olympus would beef up there battery door latch. The D360R I have now still works but had to make  my own latch to hold the batteries in. over all I would give it 4 and a half stars, better latch for the battery door would be a 5 star.","I bought mine just before summer 2000, and I haven't used my old 35 mm since then.  I immediately purchased a 16 MB smart media card and 4xAA NiMH w/ charger.  Downloading pix via the RS232 cable averaged about 30 s each -- painfully slow for a full memory card.  An internal card reader helped out a great deal when I upgraded to a new PC.<br /><br />Image quality is good but not great, as I always have to tweak colors with PhotoShop.  You can squeeze out decent 5x7's from the pix if you set up your shots right (can't crop them or you'll lose too much resolution); 4x6's are no problem.<br /><br />There's a bit of a learning curve to the menu, but since it's digital photography, you can practice lots and delete what you don't want.  I use mine constantly, and I even try to fill up both of my memory cards whenever I'm at a family gathering or camping or whatever holiday.<br /><br />Finally, I take all my pix at the highest JPG setting and ignore the lower resolutions; sort of a waste of time to get 1000 pix if you don't have any detail.","I was reluctant to enter the digital camera world, as I thought it would be a lot more complicated than just snapping a picture and having the film developed into pictures, so when my youngest son said I really 'needed' to get one (and he recommended the one he had..Olympus D-360L), I balked. Finally, I gave in, and how glad I am that I did. It has been a real winner in terms of ease of use and quality of pictures. Many look like a professional photographer took and developed them. For those who want great pictures and ease of use at a really bargain price, this is the camera for you. Most of us don't want pictures larger then 5 X 7, so why pay for more megapixels that you don't need? I also bought a 64 and a 128MB SmartCard, and have more than enough storage for vacations. Highly recommend.","i thought it was a great camera it works great easy 2 use batteries last for a whole day unless using lcd screen. takes bout 5 sec. to write a pic. w/ 16mb card can take about 230 normal quality pics / 75 high quality / 30 super high quality.","We are an EBAY Powerseller bookstore and I have run our auctions for two years.

Its weaknesses:  1) eats batteries for lunch, 2) serial interface is rather slow, 3) setup requires that you read the manual (and you'll need to read it again when you want to delete all your pictures after you download).  Valuable options:  The AC-power pack and a 32mb memory card.  Do you really need a 3-megapixel zoom for $?  Are you an avid shutter bug?  No?  Then consider this camera in the $ range.","This is great Camera I really don't understand stupid reviews out there, yes it eat bateries fast but picture quality are very great.","The Camedia D-360L was my first digital camera and I purchased it right before I went on a two week trip to Italy. I take tons of pictures and I must say that it you are a beginner here are some things I think are great.<br />Its easy to use.<br />It has a timer on it. Which is great for taking your own picture on a trip.<br />The lens is protected.<br />The lens cover turns the camera on.<br />If you leave it open it has auto shut off.<br />You can use the view finder (like your old 35mm camera) or the LCD screen to take pictures.<br />Using the viewfinder saves your battery life.<br />You can check the picture after you take it to see if its a good one.<br />If you don't like the picture you can erase it right away.<br />The pictures look great when printed (but not over 5x7)<br />The pictures look even better on the net.<br />The software that comes with the camera is easy to use and great for editing.<br />The accessories you get are great. We even used the TV cord to display our pictures from our trip. (but note when you turn the camera on the side to take a picture it will view on the TV on the side.)<br />Here are the things I wish the camera could do for me now.<br />I wish the camera took much better pictures at night.<br />I wish the camera took better pictures at longer distances of specific objects (like kids swimming in a lake) It does great when taking mountains and countryside.<br />the batteries could be rechargable.<br />Hope this was helpful and I would strongly recommend this camera.","Alright, I've got to say... this is perhaps the best camera that I've ever owned. A major step up from my first digital camera (a Mustek VDC-3500-which I'd highly recommend against), and even better than my Sony DCR-TRV130 Digital8 Camcorder (which isn't focused on taking photographs anyway), the Olympus D-360L is a dream come true. From the 1.8\" LCD screen to the sixty-four (64) megabyte (no, that's not a typo; the D-360L that I bought came packaged with a 64Mb SmartMedia chip in addition to the 8Mb chip packaged originally with the camera ... The photo quality of images taken with the camera is hardly anything to scoff at, and if you've got advanced image-editing software (i.e., Adobe Photoshop), then you can make an excellent image look even better!<br />The only downside that I've managed to find to the camera, is the same problem that countless others have pointed out: the low battery life. But, as people have recommended, this problem can be overcome with nothing more than either a large pack of AA batteries, or just by buying a dozen or so rechargeable batteries and switching out between them. There are additional quirks that I've got against the camera, but nothing that can't be overcome by spending a couple dollars or so. First, it's the fact that the D-360L camera uses a serial connection for uploading images to your computer. This means that you're in for somewhat of a wait, unless you buy a SmartMedia memory reader. But no worries! You can buy an extremely affordable SmartMedia reader ...for [very little]! ... When I plugged the SmartMedia reader into my computer, it immediately picked up on what it was, and installed the drivers automatically, without any necessary disc (although a drivers disc does come with the reader), as I'm running the Windows 2000 Professional operating system. But what I found to be the most interesting thing about the reader is this: it doesn't transfer the images through a TWAIN interface, but instead, shows up as a drive in My Computer, where you can just copy, paste, and delete the file(s) right there! Now isn't that convenient?<br />As a matter of fact, if you're a Mac user, I'd really recommend that you purchase a SmartMedia reader, because it's only an added twenty dollars, and the investment is well worth it in the long run. ... In addition to rechargeable batteries and the SmartMedia reader though, I'd recommend that you also purchase an AC adapter for the camera to save battery-life while you're transferring the images (this is of course, unnecessary if you purchase a SmartMedia reader).<br />All in all, I'd say that the Olympus D-360L digital camera was the best [money] that I've ever spent on a computer-related gadget, and I know that, if you can see past it's few (small) flaws, you'll really love this, as it's a great product, entrance level or not. My final verdict is five out of five for the camera, and I'd encourage EVERYONE to buy one of these.<br />Here's a bit of an update (August 04, 2002).  Recently, I went on vacation with my dad to Philadelphia.  Well, I went to visit Hershey Park to check out the Dolphin show, starring Clovis and Wee Tee.  The show was excellent, albeit rather short?weighing in at fifteen minutes, plus fifteen minutes of sea lions.  In any event, I took a LOT of pictures while I was there, and I began to notice that the camera was a bit slow with taking the pictures.  It took around perhaps two to three seconds to process each image in high-quality mode.  Although it might not seem like a lot of time in between pictures, it's an aeon, when your subjects are fast-paced Dolphins!  However, even though there is this little problem that I have with it, my review still holds at five stars.","...anyone...who needs parts:  Go to [Olympus' website]<br />Click on Emporium/shopping.  You can order parts there and there is also a 1-800 number to contact Olympus","I think that this camera is excellent for its value. The only thing is that when I download the pictures onto my computer, sometimes spots show up a little bit grainy. Despite what some other people had said, you can delete bad pictures off the camera,although by doing that the camera eats up even more batteries. My dad got me this camera last year, and I have been to California, Alaska, and Japan since then. My pictures turned out wonderful!! I showed them off to all of my friends, and they asked me what kind of camera I used. And although downloading the pictures onto your PC is very slow, I t is still a great camera. If money is no object, I would suggest buying a more expensive Olympus, because that is a great brand.","I love my camera.  It is easy to use.<br />I am looking for cables to buy to attach to camera and my computer so that I can download.  Some how mine have got lost or thrown out.  I could not find any other way to contact the company.  If someone could help.","For a small amount you receive your monies worth.  Picture is above average to good inside and out.  A good point and shoot camera, have owned 3 and given 2 away to get people started.","With no commputor, I have a webtv and vcr. I connect the video cable to the vcr, record the photos, then deleat the image on the smart card.  I send photos by email to friends and to my photos album.Epson.com. ( photopoint in closed ).  A great camera for begineers, not for the advanced.  Easy to understand information in the manual.  Very poor help when you contact Oympus by phone or email, just forget trying to obtain and information from them, better to read reviews.  A good camera to start with... Forget about memory card readers,scaners and printers that use the usb cables.  For use with a comptor and a good photo formate, buy a Olympus Digital...","I went from a Ricoh 35mm...to the Olympus 360.  I LOVE THIS CAMERA!  My five-year-old gets to take pictures uninhibited with my supervision and without dollar signs going through my head in regards to all of the film being used.  I love being able to take any and all pictures that I want, downloading to my pc, and erasing them from the disk in the camera.  It comes with an 8mb (allows 36 pics) camedia card but I did end up buying an additional 16mb (allows 72 pics)  because I just wanted an additional card in case of a big event.  The camera has probably already paid for itself because of all of the money saved in film development.  I love being able to immediately  e-mail pictures once they have been downloaded to the pc.  I always carry a spare set of AA batteries because the camera does go through them quickly.  I have been very happy with my purchase.","i love my olympus 360--but i have a big problem i have lost my cd that hooks my pc.(had work done on pc and they took off my camera. some how i have managed to loose my book on how to use the camera with pc. do not know how to contact olympus can anyone help me please","This is a great camera if you are just starting off... but I must say, beware of using the LCD screen too much, it will eat up your batteries.  I personally like to view the my pics right away and use the LCD screen to take pics so the short battery life was getting on my nerves.  But all in all, it is a good camera.","If you are looking for a great little digital camera, get this. Not expensive, easy to operate and using the super high quality feature, very good photos...<br />Battery life could be longer, but simply do not use the screen to take the photos and the batteries will last much much longer.","This camera is not state-of-the-art any longer, by any means, but it's an excellent buy, anyway.  I have been able to get GOOD images of everything from Christmas lights at night to extreme close-ups of flower blossoms.  I have one picture of a flower 3/4\" across that fills the frame!  It will do a fair, but not GREAT, job of stop-motion, as well...good enough to get cats playing.  The flash is extremely adjustable, and recycles reasonably quickly (less than 2 secs.).  As others have said, though, it does eat batteries!  A charger, and two sets of metal hydride rechargeable batteries, are well worth the investment, as one set of them will last about 100 pics worth.  I dearly love having this camera available, and highly recommend it as an everyday digital camera for everyone except the serious or professional photographer.","I love the camera and the software, but it uses batteries up WAY to quickly. If you buy this, be sure to get some rechargeable batteries, too.","I love it!.  Easy easy easy to use and the picture quality is quite good.  I just wish I could figure out how to use the digital zoom.  The menu option could be easier to navigate.<br />The battery life is very good and the picture capacity is good.<br />All in all I am quite pleased with it and glad I bought it.","I have been using this camera for almost a year all over the world for both business and personal. I'm now buying even more memory chips so I can take more tiff pictures as when enlarged to poster size, look great. Only negatives are no rechargable batteries.","I have had my camera for about 1 year now and truly love it, I never use my 35mm film camera anymore.  the pictures you get with this camera are great and it is so easy to upload them to your computer using the USB cable.  This camera is very user friendly and very easy to use.  I had never used a digital camera before this one!!!!!!!!","I rate this camera 5 stars because its a great camera for a beginner and easy to use. The pictures aren't exactly bad but the camera makes the objects in the pictures look farther away than they really are. But I like its features and the software that came with it.","This camera is a good entry level camera, but leaves much to be desired. First, it eat batteries, forcing you to ...rechargeable bateries and a adapter for use when downloading images. 2nd, the camera has no optical zoom, forcing you to use the digital (and the LCD screen which drains batteries.) My third gripe about the camera is that the button for the LCD screen is resecced so it won't get turned on accidentaly, but the button makes it very, very, very dificult to turn on. I reapeatadly find my self stuggling to turn on the LCD screen. My 4th and final gripe is that it has no USB connection with the package. With the serial connection, it can take me 3 or 4 hours to donwload 20 or so pictures. I would suggest buying a memory card reader.... So, this is a good entry level camera, but not much else.","I purchased a D-360L about a year ago and have been very happy with it ever since.  The camera and software are wasy to use and some nice camera features include macro, several flash settings, and you can zoom in on portiions of your picture on the LCD screen.  The only problem I have had are poor resolution when using the zoom setting that can make pictures come out grainy or pizelated.  I recommend getting a larger Smartmedia Card and rechargeable batteries.","I just got the camera yesterday and I'm raring to go, BUT -- the promised (and, in my case required!!) Macintosh serial cable is *NOT* included. You have to send in for it using the mail-in coupon in the box and it takes 4-6 weeks to get it, so if you are in a hurry to use your camera, forgedaboudit! I was disappointed, since from the tech specs listed etc, it appeared that everything I would need to get started would be included. Instead I find that I have to wait and hope. Grrrrrrrrr...<br />The folks at Olympus customer service (800-622-6372) have promised to expedite my request... we'll see! Other than this glitch, tho, the camera appears easy to use and the documentation is pretty much written in non-technical language. I just wish everything I'd thought I was getting had been in the box!","I've had my camera for some time now and I don't regret it for a second.  The price was right.  It has all the features I was looking for in a camera.  I've yet to use my regular camera.  The only downfall is the battery life, it's far too brief.  So whenever you're going on a trip make sure you take along plenty of batteries.  Other then that I couldn't be any happier.","I am very please with the camera. I looked at the new top-of-the-line \"prosumer\" models (Canon G1, Nikon 990, etc.) and came to the conclusion that they had a lot of features I would never use. I am into point and shoot.<br />I bought a 32 meg memory card (the 8 meg card that comes to with almost any digital camera is way too small) on which I can shoot 73 photos at the SHQ (1 megapixel) setting. I get a good 8 x 10 print at this setting.<br />Another thing I bought is a Sandisk external USB Smartcard reader (about $50). Downloading photos from the camera using the serial port is very slow, and eats up batteris. The card reader is easy to use and transfers a whole card full of pictures in a minute or less.<br />The only thing I miss with this camera is a zoom lense. The more expensive cameras come with 2x or 3x optical zoom.","This is a beautiful camera, perfect for a first-time digital camera user. I researched the field thoroughly before I decided on this product. I made three calls to Amazon.com advisors prior to ordering. I even questioned one technician about the camera's compatibility with an IMac. I am an adament IMac user. At no time did I read, see, or hear that the connecting cable would not connect to an IMac. I did not read, see, or hear anything about needing to buy a Smart/Media Reader/Writer. In the box containing my new camera is a card with a Macintosh address offering a ... rebate after I purchase the above-mentioned paraphanalia.  I can tell I'm going to love this camera when I finally get the above-mentioned paraphanalia so I can load and store my pictures on my computer.","This camera is awesome... it has a sturdy, compact design that is perfect for dropping in your pocket. It's perfect for the beginner- the function buttons on top of the camera for the flash, timer, etc are clearly labeled and easy to understand. The LCD viewer on the back is handy for lining up shots and for browsing images you have already saved. The Cameida software that comes with the computer is also extremely easy to use.","Antes de comprarla estuve comprando por 1 mes diferentes modelos de camaras debajo de los US$ 300. Creo que no me equivoque!.<br />Muy recomendable comprar un cargador de pilas y al menos 8 pilas de Niquel Metal. Ya no tendre que llevar rollos de peliculas pero si pilas extras a mis viajes.<br />La resolucion es clarisima, inclusive en el modo bajo que te permite tomar 122 fotos aprox. adios a los centros de revelados para luego escanear las fotos y asi compartirlas con mi familia y amigos.<br />Recomendable tambien creo (yo no lo hice) es comprar el adpatador PCMCIA o el de Diskette 3.5 asi como el adaptador de corriente.","Great camera - to prepare for an extended trip I wanted more capacity but did not want to haul around lots of extra batteries.  Step one was to purchase 4 NiMH 1600mAh rechargeable batteries w/auto and home chargers.  Be aware - many AA batteries have less than 1600 mAh capacity. Step 2 was to purchase a 32 MB San Disk card.  The result was nearly 150 pix on the disk without a battery recharge.  Amazing!  With my San Disk ImageMate which downloads the card in seconds I am - good-to-go.","I like the camera alot, although I had to send it in for repair (CCD went bad - caused a thin blue line to appear in every photo - I noticed another reviewer had that same problem). Fortunately the warranty was still in effect (1 yr). Tech support guys were were courteous and helpful, but customer support was not - something Olympus needs to be aware of (customer service rep was rude, also emails never returned). Colors in photos are very bold and bright.","For image quality, I was quite amazed by the quality of the pictures produced by this camera. At high quality (JPEG) you can get 36 pictures on the 8MB card, and presumably, with  the 64MB card ... ... that wouldbe  288 pictures! With the LCD off, the battery usage isn't too badeither. I also find that the closeup pictures (the macro mode) is also quite good, though the flash is overpowering in these situations. I'll probably experiment with a flash diffuser, possibly something as simple as a piece of white paper over the flash in these cases.<br />For Macs though, be prepared to work through a few problems. First of all, the cable that converts the PC serial connector to the Macintosh serial connector (for older macs like mine) isn't in the box, despite the label on the box which indicates that it's mac compatible. There's a coupon you can mail to get this connector free, but it should be in the box in my opinion. For modern macs, one would probably have to buy a USB smartmedia card reader.<br />Knowing this however, I also bought the SanDisk FlashDisk  adapter that allows you to read smartmedia cards from your floppy disk drive (also gone in modern Macintosh computers). It too claimed to be mac compatible but it too lacked any actual support in the box. There was NO software for the mac. I had to download the drivers from the internet.<br />Then I found the drivers claimed that OS8.6 was necessary (I was running OS 8.5.1). I was able to read single image files off the flashdisk, but not two or more. I installed 8.6 but found I had the same problem. I was subsequently able to download multiple files when I directed them to a subdirectory instead of the desktop. I can't say for sure that this alone was the cause of the problem, but at least the whole combination worked.<br />8x10's are somewhat unsatisfying (of course) but 4x5's made with the camera are really good. It would probably make passable 5x7's. Overall, I'm quite pleased. Olympus lost a star for a somewhat complex user interface and no mac cable in the box.","Since purchasing this camera, it has hardly been out of use.  From taking pictures at soccer games for uploads to the web, to producing great school projects at the click of a shutter button and download to the hard drive, it is great product, and holds up to careless abuse.  To my horror, my camera got run over in a parking lot and after I got the sliding door back on, it still takes great pictures.  More expensive models have the USB port, which is prefered, but with the money saved, you can purchase a sandisk adapter and still have change. Best purchase I've made in a long time.","We purchased our camera for the holiday season and have not been disappointed.  Colors and resolution are good.  The camera is easy to use and most importantly easy to take along.<br />I've found battery life to be almost a non-issue.  The first set of batteries lasted from mid-November until after Christmas nearly 100 pictures later with conservative use of the LCD screen.<br />The video output feature is nice for showing \"slide shows\" away from home on a plain tv screen.  Definitely consider purchasing a larger memory card and some sort of USB reader.","I just received this camera as a Christmas present and I love it.  I have been into photography for about 15 years now and have has a hard time finding a compact camera to use for birthday parties, school plays, sporting events, etc. I am used to lugging around a full size SLR (Canon AE-1) which I refuse to give up.This camera is a great companion for someone who is not quite ready to give up 35mm.  I have had no problems downloading the pictures to my computer and so far the batteries are doing OK.  Mine came with a set of the rechargable batteries.  I found the best way to use it is to use the view finder instead of the LCD monitor to take pictures and then edit on the camera after a few shots in order to conserve memory. The instruction manual was clear and concise and answered most of my questions.I would recommend it 100%","I've had this camera for a number of months now and am totally happy with it.  I am a real estate broker and use it constantly to upload photos to the web as well as for fun with family and friends and whatnot.  It's been very easy to use, takes excellent quality photos, and seems like a bargain for the price.<br />I would really suggest getting the flashpath floppydisk adapter which is how I deal with the images.  It's a floppy disk that you insert the smartmedia card from the camera into.","I didn't buy this camera from AMAZON but the price was the same. This camera is great for the everyday use. If you are a casual picture taker like myself (Family functions, kids etc.), then this camera is for you. It feels like a real camera not a cheap plastic one like some other Digital camera's feel (FUJI 1300). It comes with a 8MB smartmedia card with can take 36 High Quality pictures (which look great) it can take about 18 Super High Quality (breath taking), and about 60+ regular quality (eh...so so). Smartmedia is very cheap ($80 for about 32MB card).<br />You can directly connect to your TV via the provide NTSC cable to view your pictures on your TV.<br />There is only 2 drawbacks. It sucks batteries (if you use the LCD screen alot). I have taken about 200 pictures on a set of batteries and still going. The other drawback is the cable to transfer the images to your computer. It is a RS232 Serial cable. It takes about 10 mins. to transfer about 36 pictures. But you can always get the Viking tranfer system to cut that down.<br />I am not a photographer but I feel this camera is great bargain for someone that isn't looking to be the next National Geographic photographer!","For my needs, this camera is perfect.  The 8MB card is bigger than most cameras offer and holds enough pictures for me, and even if I want more, I can just buy another card.  The quality of picture is great, even at the medium level, and when I order pics from (on-line) they come back looking great.  The menus are easy enough to understand but do all that I need them to do.  The panorama function is the coolest thing about the camera, even though I have yet to use it anywhere other than my office and apartment (when I go to the Grand Canyon it'll come in really handy).  The software is good.  The LCD screen is clear. The picture-taking options are very useful.  Even the battery life is fine (other people have complained)... I bought two sets of NiMH rechargeables with a charger and I always have enough power.  If I have one complaint, it is that it doesn't have a USB connection... the Serial conntection is slow, but as long as you are prepared to wait a bit (go have a sandwich maybe), it is not a big deal.<br />I have already used it for a friend's new baby and the wedding of an old college friend.  The ability to put these pictures on the Internet so that friends and relatives can see them has made me a very popular chap.<br />I have a Canon Rebel 2000 SLR for those times when I need a higher quality picture, so for my point-and-shoot needs the Olympus D-360L is perfect.","If you don't need a zoom lens & if you're not into huge picture blow-ups, this camera can't be beat.  It takes beautiful pictures in all conditions. Fairly simple to operate also. You'll need an ac-adapter because of battery life & that's about it other than a card reader. The serial port connection is slow.","...But still want good pictures....I was skeptical about getting an entry-level camera due to the fact that most of the work I do is web design. Boy, was I wrong. The images compare to the highest of cameras. The interface is very easy (if you know how to read, haha). I had no problem with the serial connection taking a while (I ALWAYS have other things to do whilst uploading), and batteries don't run out too fast if you're one of those people that don't use the LCD display for every image. All in all, beautiful camera, beautiful pictures for a beautiful price.END","I received the D360-L as a gift and it has performed admirably.  I have even received reasonable battery life by using the view finder exclusively.  A major problem was downloading via the serial port on my PC.  I have the Palm V software on board and the Palm V synchronization software kicks in whenever the PC is turned on.  This in turn made it impossible for the computer to find the camera and download pictures. The solution was very simple but was not to be found in any printed matter available from Olympus or Palm.  I found the solution in an \"oh by the way\" comment in a product review magazine.  Simply select from the Palm synchro menu the option that requires synchronization to be manually activated.  Re boot and the download will run flawlessly albeit somewhat long.","This is one of the best investment I made. I used the camera for my vacation in Florida last August and I couldn't believe the sharpness and quality of the pictures when I printed them out.  The camera came with its own software for the PC.  With the LCD monitor I can delete whatever pics I don't want.  Go with rechargeable batteries because it tends to run down if you take pictures with the monitor on.  But the camera is great!!!!","This is my first digital camera, although I've used them before. After getting to know it and adding some much needed accessories, I can say it really is a great camera, at a reasonable price. The quality of the pictures is astounding considering it is a relatively basic model. The first thing I would recommend ordering with it is a Sandisk reader. This is cheap and a must have; it downloads all your pictures in an instant and thus saves the clumsy,time,and battery-consuming process of loading them by direct camera-to-computer method. If you've read about the battery life problem you'll be prepared for burying the included batteries on the first day. Others recommend rechargeables, but I've always hated them. They don't last long, and I don't like the hassle. I put in new lithium batteries and they really last. As far as actual picture taking, the only two negatives I see are problems with blurry images of moving subjects and  the lack of a real zoom feature. The zoom feature on this camera merely crops in on your existing image. However I see these  points as minor as the beauty of the picture quality, and sheer fun in using this camera make it a winner. Besides, if you want to zoom in on a shot, just take three or four steps in, and you'll be saving yourself about ... bucks. Out of all the regrettable purchases I've made in my life, I can say this is not one of them. Be careful though, being able to erase and retake shots may lead to severe camera addiction.","This is my first digital camera.  However, I have used numerous digital cameras.  This is, by far, the easiest I've used.  I had it set up, running and downloading images in about five minutes.  The software included with the camera is easy to operate, even for a dummy like me.  The pictures are as clear as any I've seen coming from more expensive cameras.  I recommend this camera to anyone buying their first one.","I really like this camera - it's my first digital one and although I can't compare it to others, I have been very satisfied with the Olympus D-360L.  I do suggest that you get rechargeable batteries and an AC adapter because the battery life isn't very long, especially if you're turning on the LCD screen a lot.  The camera itself is easy to use and the manual that comes with it is helpful.  I like the size and the design, but I do wish it came with a carrying case.  The software that comes with the camera isn't all that great, but if you're just looking for basic tools then it will be fine.  Overall, I highly recommend this camera - it's a smart purchase.","I received this camera as a gift and was quite amazed at the quality of the photos.  As stated in previous articles, the battery life is quite annoying.  One set of normal batteries lasted one shoot/download and then died.  I found that the new energizer batteries made specifically for electronics work wonderfully, providing me with 3 weeks and counting use of the camera. As far as bundled applications, they have a fine organizational and download tool, but their editing tool leaves a lot to be desired.  You might want to get Photoshop LE (unless you have the money to buy the full blown version!). Also, the bundled cable left me a bit less than satisfied as far as download speed goes, so I purchased the Olympus Camedia SmartMedia drive (USB compatible).  It is awesome!  I highly recommend purchasing it if you intend to download a large amount of photos. Overall this is a great camera and I strongly recommend it (with the USB drive) for Mac or PC users.","This camera does a lot of things for only 300 dead presidents.  It has thousands of options, great image quality, and, of course, it's digital!  Now you can take all those embarrassing photos of yourself without being afraid of the CVS guy laughing at you.<br />If you lower the image quality you can take 122 pictures on the ultra-small disk provided.  However, the quality is really, really bad (640x480 highly-distorted JPEG).  But on good quality you can take 36, which is enough for one session (you can delete the images from the camera after you download them to your hard drive.)  There's a super-high quality option which makes TIFFs, but I never use it.<br />A few drawbacks:<br />the graphics-editing program that comes with the camera SUCKS.  If you plan to do major photo-editing you should get ahold of Paint Shop Pro (jasc.com) or Adobe Photoshop (adobe.com).  Another problem is that the batteries run out very fast.  It uses four AA batteries every time, which last me about two weeks.  If you want to save on battery life, try not to use the LCD screen and instead take pictures the \"normal\" way.  Also, try not to view the photos on the camera and instead download them to your computer first and view them from the hard drive.<br />Despite these problems, it's the best deal you can find for so little money.  Unless you can afford to spend 800 bucks on something better, this is definitely the way to go.  Anything cheaper probably sucks.","I bought a cheap camera from Agfa, sent it back.  I read a lot of reviews and decided on the Olympus D-360L.  It takes great pictures for Web publishing.  I haven't even used the maximum resolution setting on it yet, as only two photos will fit on the 8MB card, and I compress the photos for the Web anyway.  I don't print pictures from it, since 35mm is so much cheaper, but I'd think 5x7 photos would look great with a good dye sublimation printer.<br />I bought an inexpensive SmartMedia USB reader from Sandisk ($30), so transferring pictures is quick, painless, and doesn't eat batteries.  As far as I know, the USB reader will work on a Mac, but I don't own a Mac.  The only thing I wish is that I would have bought the D-460Z instead, as I really miss a zoom feature.  The digital zoom on the 360 is not worth using.","This is a great camera that is a low-cost but high quality product...This little camera holds 122 pictures at the lowest quality setting!  It is very versitle and has many cool features, like panorama mode, digital zoom, etc.<br />If you're looking for a good camera to start with, you can't go wrong with this.  If you're looking to spend a little more, look at the next model up from Olympus -- it has an optical zoom (which maintains high quality, as opposed to a digital zoom).","I'm one of those people who compares feature for feature before I buy, and end up picking the product that has the most features for my set budget.  Well, this was an easy choice.  It has all the features the competition had and more, for a very reasonable price.  Quality resolution, nice LCD, adequate and easily expanded storage.  Plus all the bells and whistles I never openly shop for, but secretly druel over.  In fact, I only have one complaint, and that is that the buttons on top are not very self-explanatory.  I'll get used to this though with some use, and even now, it's not much to gripe about.","Whether you're new to digital or a pro, this camera is so easy to use.  The software is easy as well as downloading them to your pc.  I've taken  some of the best pictures with this camera.  The nice thing is that if a  picture doesn't come out, you can erase and take it over.  I will say that  if you use the screen to take pictures, it will use the batteries much  faster.  So have many handy.  Thanks....","First off, buy several rechargeable batteries when you get this camera! As  soon as I got mine, we played around with it off-n-on for no more than 3 or  4 hours before the brand-new alkaline batteries were useless. Flashes and  the built-in monitor really suck 'em dry.<br />Now, besides that, the Olympus  D-360L is my first digital camera. Now I'm not really great at taking  pictures, so I put most of the settings on \"auto\" and hope that I  can Photoshop them into looking better later on. The picture quality is  good overall, but if you want any sort of details captured, you'll have to  use the largest pixel size available, and zoom in, too. So forget about  trying to get those great concert shots from 25 rows back. Most of my work  is on the internet, so it's great for web publishing, but I doubt that  these pics would look that great if they were printed out -- but I haven't  really tried yet, either.<br />The compact design is quite good, so I can't  believe some other reviewer here said that his fell apart after a week. I  know I've carried mine around in my rough-n-tumble book bag for weeks on  end, and it hardly has a scratch on it. If you want to change the camera's  settings, there's a lot of button pushing to change the shutter,  white-balance, and image file size options. My friends have gotten quite  tired of posing and waiting for me to switch around to larger sizes, or to  zoom in, or to take the picture over again because I flashed when I didn't  want to. And there's a slight delay between when I've pushed the button and  when the camera takes the pic. \"Capturing the moment\" often takes  a couple mintues to prepare. Also, the pictures I've taken often look  fantastic on the LCD monitor, but are fuzzy when I download  them.<br />Downloading is a snap ... sort of. Just install the software once,  then hook the cable up to your serial port and ... wait. It takes several  minutes to download multiple pictures. Heck, it even takes a while just to  view all the thumbnails in the editor. The editing software included is  okay, but it's no Photoshop.<br />The very first weekend I had it, I went to a  crazy drunken club party and took lots of pictures of people dancing around  in an altered haze. Surprisingly, most of the photos came out great -- very  fun and colorful -- except when the flash goes off, people often have red  eye (which is fixable through adjustments) or if they are close to the  camera the flash washed them out like white ghosts. And if I didn't use the  flash, then they came out smeared because the shutter was open too long  since it was compensating for the missing light. It definitely takes some  learned skill to get great shots on the fly.<br />In comparison, though, for  the price you pay here, you are getting a really good deal with this handy  little device. The low-light photos are a bit grainy but quite bright  considering a normal camera would show the same situation as nothing but  black. I haven't yet figured out how to get it to take pictures so that it  looks darkly lit on purpose; it always seems to automatically compensate.  Also, the multi-photo \"panoramic\" option and the \"action  sequence\" modes are fun to play with, but not necessarily going to be  useful to me in the long run. On one 8mb card, you can fit about 16 big  files, but tons of little photos. And remember, rechargeables,  rechargeables, rechargeables!","Bought the camera a couple of months ago, as we wanted a camera that our 9  year old son could use to learn to take pictures, and we were wincing at  the $7-10/roll cost of 35 mm film, including developing.  Very good camera,  with some limitations<br />Pros:<br />  - Excellent images within the 1.3  Megpixel limits<br />  - Very good sensitivity in dark/ shadowed areas -- but  contrast can swamp subtle shadings.<br />  - Easy to use for most settings.  I had it up and taking pictures within about 5 minutes, although figuring  out all the bells& whistles took a while.  Panoramic pictures are very  nice, although you have to be careful in how you compose the set of  pictures to get good splicing in the computer.<br />  - Camedia software is  pretty good, although there are better image processing software available.<br />  - Downloading is easy although somewhat slow with the serial  connection.<br />Cons<br />  - Eats batteries.  Buy some rechargable NiMH  batteries and a charger on your way home from the store.  I keep a set  charged at all times and swap them out every time I take the camera out.  Works great that way.  Very very seldom run out of power when using the  camera.  LCD works very well, but will drain your batteries.<br />  -  Viewfinder does *NOT* show accurate depiction of what the image to be  captured.  Use the LCD for proper image composition (but doesn't work in  direct sunlight), or be willing to crop the pictures on the computer<br />  -  At low light levels is very sensitive to movement and blurring of images  (not unexpected).<br />  - It's not 35 mm resolution;  there are limits on  enlarging pictures before running into pixel limitations.  For point and  shoot though, it's great.<br />  - 2x digital zoom is a feature of very  limited usage. Figure you're buying a camera without zoom, and you won't  come in with adverse expectations.  Almost never used.<br />Tips &  Comments<br />  - We're getting almost 35 mm photo quality outputs from a HP  Inkjet printer (PSC 500) and HP premium photo paper.  The pictures look  good on white bond paper, but the difference with high quality photo paper  is amazing.<br />  - We've only filled the 8 MB card a couple of times and  wished we could download the pictures to take more.  A few minutes editing  using the thumbnail display on the LCD can delete bad pictures and reduce  the number of images on the card to take more pictures.  We do download the  camera every night and clean the images off the card.<br />  - Our breakeven  was an estimated 30 rolls of film -- if we used the camera more than 1000  images we would have found it worth it.  We took 400+ pictures alone on a  cruise to Alaska, and then listened to a friend complain about the $150  developing cost they had from their 35 mm film rolls.<br />  - We had the  policy of not taking \"scenery\" shots with the 35 mm since we  didn't want to waste money taking pictures without a person in the picture.  With the digital camera we just take pictures.  The change in attitude to  taking pictures is striking.  We find the marginal cost per picture is near  zero -- unless you print them out.  That cost is around $0.10-0.25 per 1/4  page picture.<br />Overall<br />  - Very happy with this camera, once we've  learned its foibles.  Its not perfect, but very good.  When we're going out  on a family outing, we now just slip the camera in a pocket and take it  along.  We take 10x as many pictures due to the simplicity of digital  imaging and the quality of this camera.<br />  - We highly recommend it.","After reading every review we could find, we ventured for the first time  into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R digital  camera last year. We were definitely not disappointed.<br />The D-360L was  the next step up from the D-340R. Then and today you cannot find a better  quality camera at this price, outside of the Olympus family.  The 360 has  all the same features of the 340-R, but adds capabilities to adjust white  balance, and tinker with spot metering, ISO and exposure settings.  It also  adds a nifty little zoom function in the preview screen, as well as  multiple flash and file compression settings.<br />If you want additional zoom  power you'll have to step up to the D-460 zoom for about $100 more.  It  adds a 3x optical zoom to the 2x digital one and a higher quality preview  screen.  If you want to save more money and drop a few feautures try  looking for a D-340R.  They are still around at onine shops andit is a  great camera on the cheap!  All three of the camera have the same lens,  megapixel size etc.<br />Our journey with the Olympus started just a few days  owning the camera when it accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and  Seoul, S. Korea, while we nervously left our Canon SLR at home. The camera  performed marvelously. We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more  than adequate for our needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into  our laptop.<br />We were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light  settings. We took shots at our conference including a multimedia  presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was  readable! While staying in the countryside in a traditional Mongolian  \"ger\" (tent), we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky--  even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable!<br />Arriving home we were  completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting  when printed out on our HP Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper. I  doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the  prints and a standard developed snapshot. The enclosed Olympus and Adobe  software is easy to use and functional for most home use. You will  absolutely love the Quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and  panorama shots!<br />One of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating  was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one. If you  frame... say, a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will  discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area. Olympus should  do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders.<br />Apart from that,  you will want to invest in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop  around for the best price. Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for  the flash memory card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the  flash memory card, slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into  any computer. You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all  around your table, plus a significant download time.<br />One last item-- Do  you think a 16MB memory card will be too small for your needs? The 360 will  use up to a 32MB smart media card, enough for 400+ shots at low resolution.","After searching the web and several local stores, I deceided on the  Olympus 360L for my first digital camera.  For once, I think I made a good  decision.  Right from the start, the camera was easy to operate.  The  instructions are easy to follow, and the quick reference sheet makes  getting started a snap.<br />The software is easy to intall and within an  hour, I was downloading and printing my first pictures. The next day, I  bought some photo paper and I tell ya, I have had 35 mm photos developed  that weren't as good as these.<br />I'm still on the batteries that came with  the camera and that includes a lot of time playing with the LCD  screen.<br />If you are looking for a good, easy to use, first time digital  camera that produces great pictures for under $300,  give the 360L a long  hard look.  I think you'll be happy you did.","i have used this camera for 4 months now its was my first digital camera,  i i see no need to buy or upgrade from this product is excellent to use  pixs are great happy happy joy joy i say","I'm constantly impressed by the color and clarity of the shots.  When I order copies from online retailers, I can't tell them apart from traditional camera.  I just with it had a zoom, but I didn't want to spend  ... more, so I'm satisfied with what I got.","I did quite a bit of research before deciding on the Olympus D-360L.  All  of the consumer reviews I read on various Web Sites were overwhelmingly  positive.  The high resolution and standard features are typically found on  cameras that are more than twice the price.<br />I have had the camera for  about 3 months and have takes over 1,000 images.  I am 100% satisfied that  I made the right choice.  I am not ready to get rid of my 35mm and assorted  lenses, but this camera is great fun especially for close-ups and snapshot  type images.<br />I have heard people say that battery life is a problem, the  Olympus does better than most.  I found that setting the images to medium  quality setting (which produces high quality images), using the AC adapter  for downloads and not making too much use of the video viewfinder that I  can go to over 100 images per set of 4 AA batteries.<br />If you are new to  the digital market or are dissatisfied with your current brand, I would  highly recommend the Olympus 360","I have no regrets buying this camera.  It works great and is easy to use.","Just wanted to say that this is the best camera I've ever owned. It's  almost impossible to take a bad photo with it, and it's great not having to  wait for a photo-processing lab before seeing the photos.<br />I'm an American  currently living and working in London, England. I bought an Olympus  Camedia D-360L before I left home, and I've been sending photos of my  adventures along with a daily email newsletter to my friends, family, and  co-workers back at the US office.<br />Nearly everyone has commented on the  clarity and sharpness of the photo attachments, and at work, the number of  subscribers to my Daily UK Newsletter list has swelled.<br />I just love this  camera!!!! It's small enough to slip in a jacket pocket and take  sightseeing, and the photo editing software features help turn even  mediocre shots into good photos.<br />My only criticism is that the included  Camedia photo-editing software is pretty unstable on Windows 98. I'm  running a laptop with 96 MB of memory, and find that the Camedia program  crashes frequently while using the Rotate and Filter->Brightness  features, leaving an alert dialog that won't go away unless I reboot.","I knew next to nothing about digital cameras or the software needed for  them. I bought this camera and in less than 10 mins. was taking pictures.  The quality is very good. I was able to make my way through the software  shortly after taking my first pictures and found it very easy to make  projects. I'd highly recommend this camera. The price is hard to beat for  the quality and it has many features for professional photographers that  would make it perfect for them as well!!!","When one is considering an important purchase like this one, \"ease of use\" comes to mind.  After much research through the internet,  newspaper and magazines, I found only the Olympus D-360L meets the  \"ease of use\" criteria.  First, the camera itself is small enough  to fit into one's pocketbook or a small bag making it easy to carry.  Second, the many picture-quality settings are good for amateur  photographers looking for the perfect shot or the more skilled photographer  with specific shots in mind.  Third, the LCD Monitor is useful not only for  taking wide panorama shots, but serves as a viewer to delete unwanted  pictures.  Lastly, uploading pictures into the Camedia software is simple.  Just plug the 9-prong cable from the back of the PC into the camera, turn  the camera on and click on the my camera icon in the software and voila!  the pictures are ready to view.  The software also lets you size, enhance  and remove red-eye from photos.  When you are through adjusting your  photos, you can save them to your favorite file or print them.  With the  push of a button through the software or the camera itself, the original  picture can be discarded.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.  Olympus is known for quality products and it hits that mark again.","I recieved it as a gift and was quite pleasantly surprised (although I asked for a point-and-shoot, not a digital.)  The biggest problem I have  with it is the lack of a zoom, although you artisically gifted and daring  folks can do without that, happily.  At times it CAN be slightly unwieldy,  but whatever.  Good times.","Once upon a time I owned a Nikon and assorted Nikor lenses all carefully stored in a sleek aluminum Zero case. I was a camera snob. Then had kids  and couldn't be bothered to lug around an SLR plus attachments. With the  excuse that I was buying it for my wife, I purchased one of the original  Olympus clamshell designs in 1992. Secretly I loved this little camera. Not  long after I sold the cherished Nikon. So it goes.<br />But after 8 years, the  trusty Olympus was showing it's age. And the kids responsible for my buying  it in the first place had dropped it one too many times. So I was in search  of its replacement.<br />I'm comfortable with computers and digital technology  and felt it was time to look at a digital camera.<br />I was intrigued  sufficiently to visit Wolf Camera and look at one.<br />If a picture is worth  a thousand words, experiencing something must be worth at least  10,000.<br />Unlike its 35mm cousins (Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 QD CG Camera  comes to mind and is what I wound up buying) this camera seems to have been  designed and built by a completely different company.<br />It is large; won't  fit comfortably in a shirt pocket.<br />It is heavy.<br />It is square and  boxlike (none of the Stylus Epic's sensuous lines).<br />If you are attracted  to one-shot cameras and specifically to Olympus for their small size and  ergonometric elegance be sure to actually hold one of these before ordering  over the web.","We bought this after reading all the great reviews about it.  This camera is everything that it says it is and more.  It is easy to use and the pictures come out beautiful.  The software is easy to use, within a few  moments of reciving the camera we had the software installed and were  downloading pictures.  It is battery hungry (like almost all digital  cameras).  We have found that by not using the LCD screen all the time they  seem to last quite a whille longer. I have seen the same camera in several  stores for 50 to 100 dollars more.  We are very pleased with this camera  and would recommend it to anyone who wants a quality digital camera at a  reasonable price.","I have always been partial to 35mm pictures, but this digital camera has easily matched those in quality.  Best part is - my husband is \"electronically challenged\" (can't use the VCR, computer, coffee  maker, etc without help) and he is a pro with this camera.  We love the  fact that you can correct a bad picture immediately.  The quality is  OUTSTANDING! Highest recommendation!","WONDERFUL product. Selection of this camera was not arbitrary - I spent a LOT of time researching and reading reviews of different cameras before deciding on this one.  I think my satisfaction was GREATLY increased by  purchase of 2 additional things: a card reader (I bought a Lexar USB ...  USB is worth the extra cost) and a 16MB card). I've never used the cable to  upload photos.  The reader uploads to computer are a no-brainer snap, you  can even move the photos via Windows Explorer if you don't want to use the  software that comes with the camera.  Battery time is very good based on  recent experience.  I was in Belgium for a week and never had to change  batteries.  Bear in mind that's by using the card reader for uploads and  without using the AC adapter! Good manual comes with the camera. I'm still  learning the icons on the readout, but that's a very minor thing for me.  I  use the camera for website photos and for insertion into PowerPoint  presentations.  It's superb for both.  I have no regrets and am  exceptionally pleased with the product.  It's a wonderful product for the  price. If you're on a tight budget, don't get the AC adapter until you see  if you really need it, but the card reader is really worth the money  (particularly after reading reviews by those who use the cable transfer).","I was very skeptical to buy this digital camera b/c of the manyreviews written here and the cheap price.  I am not a professional but feel that I have good eye between good and bad pictures when I print them out or email them.  What really sold me were the reviews [on another site].  This site currently ranks this digital camera 3rd overall for 1-2 MegaPixel Camera's...  I actually found so much information on this site I got tired of reading them.<br /> This digital camera has been everything and more that I expected, the panoramic feature is awesome!  I do use a mac and had no problem at all connecting it to my computer, I did cheat by using my windows 9 pin to mac serial adapter that I got for my PalmPilot.  Definitely a must buy, the LCD screen makes it really easy to pick which pictures to keep or delete.  I have owned it for almost a month and only have gone thru 1 set of batteries and have used the flash and LCD at will.  Two thumbs up!","I've had the camera for a few days now and so far I'm very satisfied. The pictures are clear and crisp and the LCD display (despite being really small) is bright and easy to see.  The flash and focus adjust automatically  so all you have to do is point and shoot. I don't know why everyone is  complaining about it eating batteries.. I put a set in two days ago and  I've shot about 100 pictures with no problems.<br />I guess my only complaints  would be that the LCD gets thumbprints all over it and that the little flap  that covers the connecters is a little flimsy & fragile feeling.","First, all digital cameras with an lcd eat batteries. that being said, this camera is without a doubt, the best bargain in its price range. having used the camera for the past two months heavily, it has performed better  than i expected. the image quality is flawless, even in low light  situations. the 8mb card that comes with the package is ample, giving 36  pictures at better than 35mm quality (in my opinion). ease of use? you bet,  the camera, once the batteries are installed, is very simple to operate,  just open the lens cover and snap away. things to consider when you buy  this camera are a USB reader to greatly reduce your uploading time, and  either rechargable batteries or an ac adapter. I also purchased another 8mb  card to give me a total of 72 very high quality pictures, but being able to  review and erase unwanted pictures with the lcd screen, one card might be  enough for most people.","This camera is an incredible value.  Looking through the stores I was dismayed at how high prices for a decent digital camera were, but then I found this one online and WOW, was it worth the price.  I was truly astounded by the quality of the pictures it took, and especially the  compression - I had guess that the included 8 MB cartridge would hold about  20 pictures, but it actually holds 36 HiRes photos! If you buy a 32 MB  cartridge to go along with it (as did I), then you can hold a whopping 180  pics total - plus the ability to delete the ones you don't want as you go  means those 180 last even longer.  The only qualm I had with this camera  was the batteries. After one day of use, they were running low.  If you  plan to use the LCD screen a lot, I reccomend either the rechargeable  batteries, an AC adapter or both.","It seems that the biggest complaint with this camera is that it eats batteries.  Maybe I mistakenly got \"super\" batteries or something.  I bought this camera about 10 days ago, have taken around 100  pictures (maybe half with flash and LCD on)and the batteries are still  going strong.  Maybe it's the dryness in CO. Dunno.","I bought this camera as a gift for a friend, and it's great for taking casual, everyday pictures.  It's versatile and easy to use, with fairly good picture quality.  Initially I thought the 8MB SmartMedia card was a  bit on the small side, but it's a fair amount of storage space.  But since  I'm used to 35mm, I think there are a few shortcomings:  First, the CCD is  weak in the blue channel.  This means that reds and greens are accurately  recorded but there's a lot of graininess/noise in the blues.  This is a  common problem in all CCD-based devices, including scanners, and when  determining imaging quality, the blue channel is very revealing.  Under  most circumstances, though, you get an acceptable image.  Second, the user  interface is a little clumsy; you have to close the cover to review images.  The buttons do different things in different modes, and sometimes it's  hard to remember which is which.  Finally, I think it should've come with a  USB cable as well as a 9-pin serial.  (The HP line of cameras include a USB  cable for faster upload.)  But for the price, this is an excellent camera,  especially for people who don't require studio-quality images.","Just bought the 360L a couple days ago and it has to be the best camera I have purchased in a long time.  Take a few minutes and read the instructions .... after that the camera is a breeze to operate.  It takes very good photos and extremely good in low or no light conditions. By the middle of July I will have my web page up with pictures on it from this  camera.<br />I love the camera  for the great price as well as the quality.  The great price let me afford  a few accessories such as another ram chip and rechargeable batteries ---  got it all out the door for [a great price].  I bought the camera at San Jose Camera  in San Jose, Ca. .... customer service was excellant.","This camera has surpassed every expectation.  The ease of use,  battery life and quality of photos continue to impress everyone around me.  I am finding, though, as I brag about what a great deal I got, that some of the  items I recently purchased online are sold locally for the same or less.  I  just thought that online had to be the lowest price because of low  overhead, right?  WRONG!  Check around, please.","Beautiful pictures, handy carrying strap, moderately portable, very user-friendly, limited zoom options...the Olympus D-360L features all of these things, and it's a very nice camera. I found two minor problems.  It  eats batteries, and the flash is bright and kind of annoying.  I can fill  its need for batteries, and without the flash the pictures are horribly  dark, so I can live happily with both of those issues. I you want a camera,  BUY THIS!","I had occasion to buy the 360 and 460 recently. Other reviews adequately describe why both are great cameras and which accessories you'll need.  Essentially, they're the same box(1.3 MegaPixel) and microcode. The same  \"darkroom\" software, CamediaMaster 1.2, comes with both. The 460  has a better user interface and a zoom.  The buttons and menus are somewhat  more intuitive, but the 360 interface isn't bad to begin with.  The digital  2x zoom is the same on both, the close-up (macro) mode on the 360 is  4\", vs. 8\" on the 460.  The feature set (e.g.: ISO, spot  metering) is similar, if there're any differences they're minor and subtle.  The ease-of-use factor of the 360 is better.  On the 460, you have to wait  for the lens to come out of the casing, and you must remember to open the  flash.  Unless you *really* need zoom, you can save yourself two hundred  bucks by purchasing the 360.","I purchased this camera several weeks ago and wanted to share a few things It is the most fun camera I have ever owned and very user friendly.I do not expereience the battery problem some have commented about, but i use the  lcd screen sparingly.I would highly reccomend this camera to any one who  likes to take pictures.The uses are limitless, love it.","I love this cam!  Best gadget I've bought in years, and I use it constantly.  Only $300 and it does everything a normal person would want.  It's a sturdy camera you can take everywhere.  Digital photography is  great.  Download to you PC quickly.  I started uploading my pics to a site  called [...] where you can share pics with friends and order kodak  prints of the digital images and they look just like regular film prints.<br />One thing you MUST DO though, is buy 4 doubleA rechargable batteries for  it.  That will usually run you about $20, but it's worth it.  The digital  cam's viewer and flash can kill your batteries in one day of heavy use.<br />Perfect starter digital cam.  But, for me, it's all I'm gonna need for a  few years.  The only thing that is bad about it is that it's a little  bulky, but that's the case with all the digital cams at this time.","I have owned my D-360L for several months, and I love it! I have taken pictures indoors, outdoors, and in low light, and they all turned out very well. The images are sharp, and the colors are very accurate. The 1280x960  resoultion is more than adequate assuming you are not planning to enlarge  small portions of the picture. Using the LCD display tends to drain the  batteries rather quickly, but the money I save on film and developing  pictures easily makes up for this. Also, don't expect to be able to use  this camera without reading the instructions. In my opinion, the D-360L is  probably the best under-$300 digital camera on the market.","I put off buying a digital camera for months because the decision was just making my head explode. Too many choices, prices all over the map, not sure what I really needed -- and accessories! Yikes!<br />Well, I read these  reviews, I took a chance and it was/is totally worth it. The camera arrived  WITH BATTERIES. I did what I always do -- started using it without reading  the directions -- and it worked. Great. I was worried about downloading but  that proved to be another wasted effort. Downloading was a breeze. A total  breeze. I love my camera. In just three days I have already filled the  mailboxes of all our relatives with new photos of my baby daughter, my  brother building my deck this weekend and more.<br />Go for it. Buy it.  Totally, totally worth it.","This is an excellent camera!  The image quality is astonishing for a product of this price range and the generated files are small, ideal for the web or e-mail. You can apply lots of zoom without pixelation. It's very easy to use. The manual is comprehensive and user-friendly. Buy a  protective case, because the camera doesn't include one and is fragile. You  can carry the SmartMedia cards in it, too. It's worth the money. We have  two of this toys (my father's and mine) and we are very pleased. Don't  forget that Olympus is an excellent brand. The bundled software is fine for  most purposes, but if you want more tweaking on the images, you can use  Corel, PhotoShop, etc. The ideal complement for this camera is a 16 Mb.  SmartMedia card. Don't rush buying it (the memory card) because the prices  are very unstable ... My advice: compare before  you buy. You don't need to buy Olympus-brand memory cards. They are  expensive (Look for other brands like SanDisk), and the only advantage that  they have over the generic cards is the Panorama function (the ability to  take 3 or 4 photos and link them) The camera price is very stable, online  or at a retail store. Consider buying a battery charger, because if you use  the screen too much to take photos, it will drain the batteries quickly.  (Use instead the optical viewer to take photos and the LCD screen to review  them). I have a Kodak charger with NiMH batteries and it works really nice.  Don't use alkaline batteries, because they don't last for long. If you buy  the D360L at some stores, you will be offered with a 4-year full-protection  program. It's worth considering. We are really happy with the camera. One  drawback: The downloading time is long via serial port, specially if you  have a big SmartMedia card with many images. If you are in a rush, buy an  USB adapter. For me, the speed is ok!","This is a terrific little camera.  Perfect for sending photos over the internet or for local printing.  As with most digital cameras, it LOVES to suck up battery life.  You should consider a recharge unit, ac adapter (for  downloads) or 3 1/2 inch smartmedia adapter (for downloads).  VERY easy to  use - - out of the box.  Anything that isn't obvious is detailed in the  directions.  I'm very satisfied.","Pros:  Cheap, great resolution, good flash, great size and weight, easy to use software.<br />Cons: EATS BATTERIES!  (maybe 5 photos using LCD but significantly more if using the viewfinder), zoom sucks (you have to hit  about 5 buttons to get it to zoom 2x, and you have to use the LCD to do  so--see previous comment).<br />I decided to return the camera.  I compared my  camera to those of others on my trip, and so I decided to spend a little  more and get a better one.","Awesome camera! Nice display, useful features. I would suggest purchasing of the Flash Path floppy drive adapter for easy and fast download of your photos.","Actually, I bought mine at hifihut.vstoremall.com None the less, this is my fifth Digital Camera and I am convinced that it is THE BEST. Each camera I have owned was from a different manufacturer and all in this price range.  The picture quality exceeded my expectations. Ease of use is great and so  is battery usage. I will probably buy another Olympus camera in the near  future!","Awesome pics, easy to use, lame software, lame downloadcapability.  Buy the Sandisk Imagemate USB to rapidly downloadpics. Do NOT buy Sandisk 16MB card - it's not compatible with the 360L.  This camera desperately needs optical zoom, but it is a great start. I love mine, and the pictures blew away a friend's more expensive, gadget infested Sony Digital Mavica.  Why can't a great camera company get together with a great computer company and get it right?...","What a great camera. You put in the batteries and start clicking. The pictures are great and easy to download with the supplied cable and software. This digital camera deserves all the high ratings it has  received. That's why I bought it, and I'm extremely satisfied.","Our \"kids\" bought us an Olympus D-340R for our 40th wedding anniversary last August.  Since then I have used no other camera though I've been taking pictures for 50 years and have a nice accumulation of SLR  equipment.  With our offspring in California and Virginia, we use the  D-340R to e-mail pics just about every day.  It produces outstanding  results with very good resolution and outstanding color.  Thought enough of  the camera to purchase one (D-360L) for one son and will buy another for  the other son.  Just came back from a 2 week stay in Hawaii where I took  the 340R and my Canon A1 as a back up.  Took 350 pictures with the D-340R  and did not take the A1 out of the bag.  Have all the Hawaiian pictures on  a zip disk.  Pictures are easy to download.  Bought rechargable batteries  and three extra Smartmedia chips. I highly recommend the D-360L to anyone  looking for a digital camera in the $300 price range without need for  optical telephoto requirements.","The little Olympus is an excellent digital camera for photo amateurs (like me and 99.99% of you). It's rightly considered excellent value for the price, for a number of reasons.<br />Images: the quality of images ranges from  very good to acceptable. The resolution is high enough for album-size  prints, and for web posting. As far as I could tell, the optical group is  good (no distorsions and luminosity gaps).<br />Usability: shooting commands  are very easy, although exposure correction and \"film\"  sensibility can take some time to set up. Nice features are the ability to  shoot sequences and to have wide/spot exposure meter. The \"macro\"  option works fine, but the \"2x\" option is almost worthless to me.  It's better to magnify the section of interest in the editing  phase.<br />Built-in editing: the camera commands are also very easy to use  (you just have to keep the shutter closed). You can view your pictures on a  TV without needing a computer. You can zoom over a picture section. More  important, you can easily store/access/erase pictures, and the quality of  the LCD screen is good (brightness can be adjusted). Downoading images on a  PC/Mac is straightforward too. Overall, it took me less than one hour to  become aquainted with the camera proper.<br />Now with the downsides. The  plastic case has a fragile silver finish which can be scratched too easily.  The camera consumes a lot of power, but life can be extended by keeping the  LCD off, although it is tempting not to. Finally, for a total extra cost of  $50, I would advise you to buy a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and a  charger (NOT Olympus: too expensive) and an additional 16Mb+ smartmedia  card (also usable of Rio and other MP3 players).","This is my first digital camera and one super pleasantsurprise. It's gotta be the most bang for the bucks camera out there.I am a cautious buyer and did lots of research first. (Thanks Amazon) One common complaint was battery life.  If you are going to turn on the LCD monitor and stare at photos every five minutes then it is going to eat batteries. First of all, get an Energizer ACCU rechargable for NiMH AA batteries. Do NOT get NiCads!  If you don't overwork the LCD monitor, batteries are NOT a problem. I took about 40-42 HQ (1280x960)shots on one fully charged set of NiMH's. About fifteen of those were with flash. I took my new toy to London where my charger would not work so I took a bunch AA Alkelines as back up. They are still in the unopened package. I highly recommend the purchase of a FlashPath Floppy Disk Adaptor...  It was shipped the next day. They include an 8mb smartmedia card which is good for another 36 HQ shots. An 8mb card comes with the camera. The only difficulty I had was taking panorama shots in bright sunlight.  It is difficult to see the monitor but would have been better had I turned up the brightness to \"high\". The 360L has lots of nice features that I had not even known about. And, it is so great to take a shot and email it within minutes without the hassle of using up the rest of the roll and running out to have it processed. This is a five star plus camera. Goodbye film and vinyl recordings. Who needs ya? Meybee a museum.","I got this camera about a month ago and I must say I am quite impressed!  This is a great camera for the money and although it lacks much of the fancy extras that more expensive cameras have, you won't miss them.  For  personal use this cam is great.  You get good quality pictures and 5  diffrent quality settings.  I highly recommend this camera.","I am in love with this little camera: easy to use, great quality (at least for my needs), excellent price. I could not have asked for more.","I have been using the camera for 6 months now and have been very pleased with the results.  The resolution is what you get with $600 and up cameras.","I bought the Olympus D-360L because I wanted a digital camera and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. And the Olympus D-360L have very good \"pixels per dollar\" resolution.<br />The picture quality in the  Olympus D-360L is much better than I expected it to be. And it is really  very easy to use. I was also impressed with the software that comes with  the camera. Its amazing how good pictures come out in low light with no  flash.<br />The 1.3 Megapixel resolution is excellent not only for the range  of 'entry level' digital cameras. It is also enough good for professional  use: rather often we use my pictures in layout of the Home Computer  Magazine to illustrate product reviews and so on. The colours are great!<br />The *****-star reviews this camera has been receiving are right on the  money. The Olympus D-360L is an excellent digital camera.","The camera's great. I'm really PO'D though because the specs state that it is compatible with Macs. The truth is they have some cable you can send away for but it only works with the older Macs. If you own an IMac or any  new Apple with the usb port THEY HAVE NOTHING. But they will try to sell  you a smart card reader for $80 that does have the USB port. Calling this  camera Mac Compatible is deceptive advertising. I'm returning my camera.","I bought the Olympus D-360L for my wife as a birthday present. Literally right out of the box we were both taking great shots indoors and out. The quality is great for our amateur needs, and some of the shots even look professional to our untrained eyes. We have yet to read the manual for tips, no doubt the pix will be even better then. My only complaint is that Olympus and all resellers that I'm aware of advertise the camera as platform-independent. However, an 'optional' cable adaptor is required for Mac connecting, and even then only to an older (non- G4, G3, or iMac) Mac's serial port. If it doesn't plug and play for both PCs and Macs, it's not platform-independent. ...","I received my camera a week ago and I am very impressed with ease of use and options available with this camera.  It takes great pictures.  I am usig it to post pictures to the web.  I have set the camera to it lowest  setting which is all that is needed for web use (480x640) and with the 8mb  smart media card included it will hold 122 pictures. I recommend getting a  media card reader since it makes downloading quick and easy.  Thanks Amazon  for the customer reviews. They were a great help in choosing the right  camera.","I have really enjoyed this camera now that I finally can download pictures on my computer.  It was easy to install the software and now I am sending pictures to all my family members.  The camera is easy to use, but a little  bit non-intuitive if you haven't read the manual in awhile.  Also, the  limited ability to zoom and take different types of pictures is a bit  frustrating, but you get what you pay for.  For posting pictures on the web  this camera is fine.","I read all reviews here and then  bought one from Amazon.com and took many photos using this camera. I thought the picture quality is very nice. But one important function is missing: after I download the photo images to my  PC using the CAMEDIA Master 1.2 software, I found that the date can not be  imprinted automatically on the right down corner of each picture. I read  carefully the camera manual and the software help documents, but no any  answer there, so I called the Olympus tech support hot line (1-8885534448).  the person there told me both the camera and the software can not  automatically add the date on a picture,  but if I buy a speicific Olympus  printer for printing, the date can be there,  or I can manually insert a  text box on each picture, I tried but the effect is bad because  the date  font is not quartz font so it does not like a phote picture. if any body  knows how to solve this problem, pls let us know. BTW, I think this  function should be very easily realized in a digital camera, but I am  really wondering why the Olympus company does not include it in this model.","I was looking for a point and shoot digital for use in our office where camera technical skills are few.  I also didn't want to spend a fortune. Based on other customer reviews, I bought this camera. It is an outstanding  value. Out of the box, I took a close-up (8\") shot of a flower that  everyone is raving about.  The water droplets on the flower showed, and the  depth-of-field was excellent. In testing the camera, I choose the worst  scenario: me facing the sun taking a picture of a person.  The sun was  setting, putting it just of the subjects shoulder.  With the camera set on  automatic, the result was very acceptable. Face was recognizable.  It was  almost \"arty\" because of the suns rays. The next test was in  extremely low light.  The results were great.  A little washed out on close  subjects as you would expect, but overall picture quality was very, very  good. This is a great point and shoot camera with enough variable settings  to provide some great shots for someone who wants to experiment with low  light, action, sequences, etc. Downloading was a snap.  Overall a  completely intuitive camera.  I didn't read the manual until after I had  shot a couple dozen pictures.  And I only read the manual to learn some of  the sublities of using the camera. Five stars for sure! BUY THIS CAMERA!","I had been searching the digital camera market for months trying to figure out which camera to buy within usd 400 when i came across the Olympus-D360L. I had been reading the customer reviews for several days on  Amazon, and was very much prepared for the short battery life, only 30 good  quality photos with a 8 mb smartmedia card etc. BUT, was i surprised !  Not only does a set of 4 AA batteries (good quality, i.e. Duracell or Sony)  last for the entire 8 MB shoot, but it also allows for a full /  unrestricted use of the flash. To make matters even more impressive, you  can take as much as 122 pictures (standard setup) and the quality of these  photos is amazing. Only if you download these photos and zoom in 2-3 times  into the photo will you feel the 'mosaic', but for ordinary folks like you  and me, we dont need to zoom in that much, and standard photos itself is  extremely good. Furthermore, if you view the photos on TV the clarity is  even more amazing. One thing though ... viewing 'portrait' pictures on TV  is a strain on the neck and the camera does not have any builtin feature  which could switch 'portrait' pictures to 'landscape'.  For usd 299 .. this  camera is a steal !",".... ...purchased this camera after doing much research (magazines,newspaper and online).  I am so pleased with it.  After reading the manual and \"playing with the camera, \"learning how to operate the camera, how to load the pictures into the computer... it all came together and \"I'm up and running.\" I took people's advice and bought the...Olympus adapter--well worth it.  Much better than using batteries.  Camera manual is very user friendly; unfortunately no manual for the software (print out the online-supplied manual).  Since I am not very computer savvy nor Windows savvy, I have amazed myself that I was able to accomplish this task in only a few days.  Wonderful camera for the money and for my purposes.  No regrets at all.","I've had my D-360L for about 2 weeks and I'm still amazed at it's features, and it even had more features than I was expecting!  The lcd is crisp and enables you to magnify sections of the picture itself which is an  excellent feature.  The software is very user-friendly also...I highly  recommend this camera.","I've had the D-360L for around 6 months now and overall, it's functioned flawlessly.  The pictures are crisp, with remarkable detail.  I do have one critisism however, the battery life is appalling  :(  This thing EATS  batteries!  I have found that not using the LCD display helps a little  though.  All in all, a great little camera for a good price.  Just make  sure you have plenty of spare batteries with you on your trips (or buys  some rechargables).","You cant beat the qaulity for the price every pic I took was X-O-lent, my girl friend never look better, even the software was a major pluse. I just have to say that the MaC user was foolish and should have cheked out his crappy MaC's befor purchase of this X-O-lent camera !","I've had the D360L for about two weeks and have been snapping everything -- so far I've been *VERY* pleased with the resulting images.  I also bought the standalone mediacard reader; it installed on my PC like a champ  with absolutely no problems.  Together the two components make for a great  experience!  Even the 8meg card that comes with the camera seems roomy  enough for the kinds of web images that I want to mostly make.  My only  criticism is that there is a considerable delay from when you push the  button until the picture is actually taken -- but I see this same phenomena  with other cameras (both film and digital); it seems to have more to do  with focusing and red-eye reduction than anything else.  (The later can be  disabled).  All in all, I'm very pleased.","I have purchased this camera and find that I cannot use it as it came out of the box. I have 2 macs (Power pc6500 and Imac) and there is no cable to connect to either one. Olympus Tech support tells me it cannot be used with  a usb cable, and you need an adapter to connect it to a mac serial port.  They will send you one if you use a couplon which is in the box. (think 6  weeks). The alternative is buy the floppy adapter for the film reader. List  price $70.00","In addition to what Tim wrote, the camera pays for itself.  Nofilm processing, great for those occasions when you only need one ortwo shots and not waste a whole roll.<br />It is also great when you need to take a few shots for insurance purposes or if you are in NYC it is great when you need it to fight parking tickets.  Aside from that, it is a great little gadget!  END","The D360L camera is very easy to use and takes awesome pictures under almost any conditions. The resolution and features are truly incredible for a camera in this price range. The software installs easily and has good  help information to guide you through the image editing process.<br />The  camera comes loaded with many nice features. About the only thing lacking  is an optical zoom. I'm a frugal consumer and decided that the added cost  of an optical zoom wasn't justified for my intended use of the camera. Most  features have been covered in other reviews but one nice feature that I  haven't seen mentioned much is the video out jack and cable (included) that  allows you to view your photos on a television. My parents are in their  80's and don't have excellent vision, so the television connector lets me  share photos with them without them having to peer at the tiny LCD  screen.<br />Accessories add a substantial amount to the cost of your camera  outfit. Expect to pay an extra $100 to $250 above and beyond the camera  price for them. I bought a SanDisk SmartMedia 32MB memory card, a DigiPower  Solutions 12X rechargeable power pack, and a SanDisk SmartMedia USB  external drive for downloading onto my PC. The only problem I encountered  was with the Sandisk SmartMedia USB external drive. The install software  had trouble locating a device driver, but I was able to locate the correct  driver at the Sandisk web site and get things working properly. I have not  had any experience with Olympus support, since everything works  great.<br />The bottom line is that this camera offers fantastic value for the  money you spend on it. You really can't go wrong buying this camera. It  rocks!","I disagree that the battery life is short. it is better than any digital camera out there! If you cant pop batterys in 3 times a year what do you want? the pictures are goof proof, and of outstanding quality. if you don't  like it : erase it, and take another. If there was a higher rating than 5.  I would give it to this camera..","might be a good buy for the money, but if you need accurate color, go with something else (like nikon 9..)  the camedia software is not the greatest either...","This camera is truly easy to use, and it seems to be of reasonably good quality. The instructions aren't anything to write home about, but they suffice.  The included software takes a little getting used to but it does do the job, just not as easily as some of the aftermarket stuff. The most  amazing thing about this camera (compared to both 35's and other digital  cameras I have used) is that it is almost impossible to take anything but a  high res. perfect picture. The macro mode is fun too, and good for online  auctions or any application where a detailed closeup is needed.  I am very  pleased with my purchase. The only negative is that the batteries do not  last that long and either rechargeables or a transformer are needed.","I bought Olympus D360L online and is the best camera for theprice. I did quiet a research on various models and this has the bestrating too. Lightweight, well-priced and high quality pictures are the features. Software is easy to install, downloading time is around 5 secs per picture, which is quiet good. If you can afford some more money buy with USB and olympus adapter. Optical zoom is not there, but i think this is ok for the money. if you can spend more money look for C2020 or D450.<br />Would like to add some more on this camera. This camera gives a vertical green line in almost every picture which is very disturbing. I called up Olympus and asked for an exchange, but they refused to do that. Instead they said the green lines are because the batteries are left in the camera itself. They suggested to remove the batteries if camera is not in use. I have tried that option but the green lines come back after a couple of pictures.<br />Keep testing ur camera and make sure it doesnt display those green lines...","I have done photography for many years and am really pleased with the quality of the pictures. The resolution and sharpness make this a must have camera. Very simple to use once you've read the instructions. This is the  newest version of the D 340R, which had very high ratings. This newer  version (D 360L) has the bugs worked out and really turns out great  pictures.<br />This has been fun for our family since the kids can use it and  I am able to delete or keep the pictures I choice. I have purchased this  only after months of reading and doing my research. No question that for  the money; this is the camera to buy. It auto focuses with incredible  results. You will be impressed! Just buy it!","EXCELLENT!  I bought this camera largely based on the reviews that i saw here in Amazon.com. I have to say that the 5-star reviews this camera has been receiving are right on the money. This camera has everything the  normal every day user would need as well as features that the advanced user  would appreciate. Picture quality is generally very good. The 5 different  picture quality settings give you the ability to use this camera for a  variety of uses (home, office, web etc). There are so many options such as  panoramic pictures, zoom/macro, ISO settings, slow shutter speeds for  night/low light conditions etc.. And the 1.3 Megapixel resolution is  excellent for this range of 'entry level' digital cameras. This camera is  also very good for night use as it seems to be able to handle a variety of  lighting levels quite well.  When you consider the price it really is a  VERY good buy. Once again i say EXCELLENT!","I bought this camera because it ranks high in  \"pixels per dollar\" (resolution) and because I own three other Olympus cameras which have been outstanding performers--good picture quality and easy to  use. I spent some time comparing the features of different brands and  models in the $300 to $800 range.  Dollar for dollar this camerea is very  hard (impossible?) to beat.  What you get for twice the price isn't that  much more with the exception of a zoom.  Zooms are a mixed blessing anyway  because so often you get blurry pictures (because you don't use a tripod).  Plus, you usually give up some close-up ability when you have a zoom.  The  zoom might be more important if you don't have some photo editor software  to crop, enlarge, or otherwise manipulate your digital pictures.  Some  minor concerns.  I find the look and feel a little \"clunky\"  compared to other Olympus cameras and other brands.  Also, the new models  are less iMac friendly.  So, I bought an Olumpus SmartMedia Reader which  added to the cost but is a very cool device.  And battery life?  I read all  the comments about getting rechargeable batteries but I was still shocked  at how fast the batteries wear out.  Still, all-in-all, this is a great  camera for the price.","I did a lot of research on lower cost digicams (<$400) and decided on the 360L since it was the update to the overwhelming popular 340R, and am more than happy with it(was considering the Fuji mx1200 too). The pictures  are of great quality & the features are very useful. Multiple settings  for ISO, flash, spot are great, and if you rather point & shoot it does  a great job there too! Extras such as the autofiring action mode (takes  rapid shots, one every half a second for up to 10 secs) are good for casual  fun as well. The software suits its purpose. I agree the battery life is  not the best, but all digicams will drain AA's very quickly, I invested in  Ni-metal rechargeables and seem to be doing fine with those. So far I've  been using the serial port download, it's fairly slow, but I can live  instead of shelling out for a USB adaptor. 8MB can fit lots of standard  quality, but I really preferred the super-high quality shots where you'll  only be able to squeeze 18 shots onto the 8 MB smart media.","I went to CNET to get a good value digital camera review.  Iread about the Olympus 340 and learned Olympus had revised the camerato a later and greater model ... 360.  I purchased the camera and USBconnector.  I configured the camera and installed the various software packages in minutes.  Within 30 minutes, I was taking pictures in my backyard.  The output is GREAT!  I highly recommend the camera to anyone.","I'm a teen who has a limited amount of money to spend. Normally having less quality items. But this camera is the best thing i've ever bought. One suggestion, that is to get a floppy adapter for the smartmedia card, the serial port is kinda slow.","I got the Olympus D360L because I wanted a digital camera and I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  The picture quality is much better than I expected it to be, and it is very easy to use.  I was also impressed with the software that comes with the camera and what I was able to do with  pictures after I took them.  Its amazing how good pictures come out in low  light with no flash.  Since it is so much less expensive than the 450 Zoom,  it doesn't have a traditional zoom, it has a digital zoom, which functions  like a traditiional telephoto lens.  So when I want a zoom, I walk closer  to the subject.  The camera lets you take perfect pictures only 4 inches  away from your subject, and that is pretty cool.  My advice:  If you have  $500, get the 450 zoom, if you don't want to spend that much, the D360L is  a great camera and I'm very satisified with it.","I just got my camera today and so far am really impressed withit. The features and quality of the photos really make it worth themoney. You have lots of control with this camera: adjustable white balance, shutter speed, ISO settings, flash settings, spot metering, etc. I found the panarama mode really cool--take as many pictures as you want your panorama to have and then the software program stiches them all into a seamless image.  I did a quick and dirty test in the office and the resulting image looked great! I couldn't tell where the photos joined! Overall, the software program is pretty nice. Mac Compatible, but you must mail a form back for a free serial adaptor.","I looked at a lot of cheap digital cameras before my friend told me about this one.  It had a good feature set so I bought it.  I've been really impressed with the picture quality, especially compared to my friends with  more expensive floppy-based cameras.  It's also really small compared to  those clunkers.  It doesn't have a zoom, but night pictures and flash come  out  very well.  I've been very happy with it so far--used it as my only  camera on my trip to Hawaii with great results.  Be warned, it goes through  batteries quickly--we got some rechargeables that helped."]},{"name":"Sony Mavica FD-95","amazon_reviews":["Excellent","great camera love to use it. got to have computer with floppy disk drive and dvd burner(i have) and you will injoy it.","I have had a Mavica MVC FD95 for over 4 years now.

I bought mine remanufactured and didnt get the adaptor for memory stick. It is a great add-on, but not essential. I'll stay with the diskettes, because they are cheaper, easy to get and easy to use in any computer.<br /><br />One suggestion, get an extra battery. there are used ones and clone ones now that are cheaper ($15-$22.00), so it isn't the big investment it used to be of $35. to $55.00. Sony uses the same battery in numerous products. I found the battery gave out too quick (or I used it too much).  Plus, when you use the camera, you will be in a place that a recharge is not possible, and the extra battery is a great help.<br /><br />My only complaint is the switch from still-to-video-to-play pops too easy from one to the other. It has really played havoc with the pictures. BUT I think that is more all thumbs me and not the camera.<br /><br />Suprisingly, the price of a 95 has held up well in resale. I paid maybe 60.00 more than it is re-selling for now. That is a perk, if you plan to resell after a set time of use.","I have had mine for approximately a year now and have had very excellent performance. I have experiance with many cameras, and digital is definately the way to go. The economics of it outways film cameras tremendously. I can hold over 400 photos on 100 floppy disks costing me only about $22.00 per box of 100 floppys. Try doing that with a film camera. And if you miss a shot or make a bad shot, just delete it, their's no waste. The only negitive aspects to this camera is the autofocus is quite slow for action shots, by the time it focuses and snaps the photo, the object is long gone. I have missed many shots due to this, I recommend planning action shots very carefully. The quality of the photos are very good for a 2.1 MP camera, you can make 8x10 photos with relitively good results. But if your looking for the quality like a 35mm film camera has than this isnt for you. And on occasion, you will find a floppy disk that won't format and won't hold any photos, I just ditch them and use another, the cost is very minimal. Overall this is a very good digital camera.","Super shot camera!!!  Large enough to get your hands on and feel like a camera.  What's more, it uses 3.5\" disks to save your pictures on in low res to superhigh res.  You can format the disks in the camera and after you have saved the ones to keep you can write on the disks again.  I've taken pics of mountain goats and bighorns with the 10 zoom and have edited them with both corel photo and Adobe photoshop programs and have printed them to film quality 8 x 10's.","I took more than a thousand pictures with it in a month, until I gave it to my uncle. I only remember rechearching a battery every two days. That's how great it is.<br />I used it outside when it was hot(it was always hot though) and it never malfunctioned. The heat may have damaged a disk or two, from my bulk of 75 pack.<br />Let's keep things simple:<br />-The zoom is incredible! Sometimes you see once in a lifetime shots, but they're usually far, far away. With this camera, you'll have that chance! They say that the digital zoom reduces the quality of your pics, but I don't really care and it doesn't affect significantly enough to make it lower than excellent.<br />-My last review said \"more than 40 pics per battery\". After filling my 75 disks, it seemed to be 100 if you don't use the LCD screen too often. Why it was 40 for me? I used up a lot of juice when I was showing the pics to people. That's all.<br />-The weight may be an advantage if you see it differently. I might use a heavier camera for a job so a 2 pound camera is nothing. If I used a lighter camera, it was much easier shaking it and ruining the pic. I took 800 pics in a week. Did I complain? Nope.<br />-The slow speed can also be a good factor. If you had a slow camera, you would be careful to take any pictures. If you had a really fast one, you would take a whole lot more without being concerned about quality and also you need more memory. It made me a better photograph, simple as that.<br />-The size is also a good factor. The grip is perfect. You can hold up your arm as a tripod and relax. With a small camera, you'll feel some tension after a while.<br />-It's not a camera that can be stolen easily. If a robber grabbed it and ran away, it would slow him down and it would tire him out. A small camera, on the other hand, will be snatched and kept in a pocket. Need to say more?<br />-I had no problem taking pics in a bus, but in a train, things may pop up by bluring anything behind. Be sure that the window is clean since usually it's dirty(the dust or filth is usually black or disgusting).<br />Well if you asked me why you should buy it, I have to compare it with other models. First the zoom eliminates most of cameras so we have a few left. You must have a stable zoom, one out. Then you must tell me how many pics you have to take in 10 seconds. This one can take around 2.5 so it's nice for trips or anything else. I don't recommend this one if you must take a lot of good pics in a short time, but then you wouldn't need the zoom so it's up to you. I recommend compact flash or smart media so the price total will rise up quickly. The pics are bigger(around 2 to 10 times as much memory of sony mvc-95) so you must buy a lot of 128 mb cards. And finally you may have only one choice or two. Obviously, you'll find digital camera web sites and get full reviews. Forget film, digital is the way to go.","Found the dual capacity to be very useful as the memory cards will hold a whole vacation of shots!

IF YOU JUST WANT TO POINT AND SHOOT, IT DOES IT WITHOUT A PROBLEM. HOWEVER, IF YOU WANT TO BE CREATIVE WITH YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY, THIS IS WHERE THIS UNIT REALLY SHINES. YOU CAN TURN OFF THE AUTOFOCUS FOR SHOTS THAT YOU WANT TO BLEND FOREGROUND AND BACKGROUND. THE MACRO FEATURE BRINGS THE LENS TO WITHIN ABOUT TWO INCHES OF YOUR SUBJECT. THE 20X ZOOM KEEPS THE FOCUS SHARP ON YOUR DISTANT SUBJECTS. THE MEMORY STICKS ARE GREAT; A 96 MB STICK HELD ABOUT 260 OF MY PICTURES.<br />I ONLY HAVE TWO CRITICISMS. THE AUTO FOCUS MAY TAKE TOO LONG FOR ACTION SHOTS. AND THE MEMORY STICK FLOPPY ADAPTER(YOU NEED ONE OF THESE, A REGULAR FLOPPY WILL ONLY HOLD 4 PICTURES IN HIGH RESOLUTION MODE)TAKES ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS TO RECORD THE SHOT. A LONG TIME IF YOU HAVE WIGGLING KIDS, AND WANT TO TAKE MULTIPLE SHOTS.<br />I STILL WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET ONE OF THESE. IT'LL MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A PRO PHOTOG!","My FD95 damages the recording disks at a rate of about 1 in every 12 disks. The Disk Drive has been replaced ($...) once and I am still having trouble with damaged disks. Usually Norton can salvage the images on the disk. The camera is very good at capturing still images. It is very difficult if not impossible to use on moving subjects. Try using a borrowed FD95 on your grandkids bouncing off the walls and you will get the idea.<br />I have had trouble getting out of the film camera mindset. You need to train yourself lo look at your subjects differently with this or any other digital camera. This may account for some of the negative reviews of this almost very good camera.","The Mavica MVC-FD95 is an excellent purchase. I have used it in low light to full light conditions with good results. THe quality of the pictures is excellent, and you do not need to store your images in the highest resolution. Color rendition is also excellent, with a high level of resolution which is important in the type of work that I do.<br />The storage on floppy discs has been very helpful to me, especially now that floppies are so inexpensive. You can store up to 32 pictures per disc which is close to using a 35mm camera film. I detail on the label the contents what is stored and have not had a problem with mixing pictures up. It will also allow you to film short mpeg movies of up to 5 seconds in duration.<br />It is somewhat bulky to carry and will not fit a small camera bag. I certainly overcame the bulkiness without much problems. The menus to control the camera features are clear and easy to understand. Because of all its features, it does tend to \"consume\" a lot of power. I keep my camera charging when not in use. With proper use, I can leave it on for up to 4 hours continuously.","I just bought mine off of that ebay site for allot less but not to worry.  I was about to pay the Amazon price.  While I hear allot of people talk about the floppy disk, I personally do not have a floppy in my PC Atholon 1.33Ghz 1gig of DDR266 ram which would defeat the purpose of haveing a top of the line computer having a floppy disk I run the Fire Wire and USB for any talking to the computer for uploading and downloading I do have a 64 meg memory stick in it which gives me well over enough space to have video and images. For the average point and click person there is more than enough space to use on a memory stick of 32megs to 64megs (mem-sticks).  Floppy's are great if you have a floppy disk drove in your computer(which I do not)","Just pick this camera up at my local Base Exchange, while I paid a lot less than what it is offered for here ..., I must still say that it is well worth the price that Amazon offers it for aswell.  The camera is actually very light for its seemingly encumbering size, and while it is bigger than most cameras (due to the floppy drive), it fits quite well into my hands.  People with smaller hands may want a different camera like the Sony Cybershot.  I have taken a few pictures in different areas, outside, inside, light and dark and they all turned out great.  The 2.1 Megapixels are more than adequate for the amature photographer.  I haven't even begun to explore all the options, the self timer works great giving you 10 seconds to get into place with your friends or family before the picture is taken, and don't worry about focusing because the auto focus does a great job as well.  The main reason I picked this up over my other too choices was because the Cybershot F550 seemed to leave some blur in the pictures when I took my test shot with it, and the Olympus 2040 and 3040 just didn't have the zoom capability that I needed.  My one complaint is that the battery just doesn't seem to last long enough but I'll pick up the longer lasting battery and use the original as a spare.  Don't want to carry floppys around?  I have taken all my test photos on Floppies so far and at 1024 x 7xx I seem to be able to fit 10 pictures per disk.  I also picked up the memory stick adapter ... and a 64MB memory stick ... for when I am in a situation where disks seem to be too much of a hassle, like when I'm out on the town in Romania or Hungary or something. All in all this camera is a great buy, I highly recommend it to anyone.","With 10x Zoom and rechargable Lithium-Ion battery, how could you possibly go wrong!! If you are using the camera in bad light, or have to focus quickly, this camera does in both quickly and magnificently! Great for home movies of your wife and her lover getting it on behind the Chinese Buffet Dumpster!  With the 10X zoom you can really get close to the grease smears and nail marks on that dirty, dirty, dirty Jezebel. anyways, enough of my personal life. This is a good camera. Easy to use, Easy to figure out.  Sony, bravo. keep up the good work.  Much love to the Pacific Rim. Keep it (Digitally) Real. Word.","While I was in Jamaica I borrowed a MVC-FD95 Digital Camera. I took about 320 pics mostly at 1040x768 resolution. My thoughts: 1. Easy to use  2. It is quite light for its size.  3. It has very good telephoto facilities but the wide angle (39mm equivalent) is not really wide enough for landscapes.  4. I found that it was quite slow at taking pictures and if the shot was of a bird it had flown away by the time the camera had taken the picture.  5. I got 90 minute battery life and the recharge time was quite good.  6. Changing floppies was a pain in the rear (10 pics/floppy at 1040x768), it also has 1600x1200 resolution but you only get 4 pics to a floppy.  7. I loved the AE (shutter) mode (my real camera is a Canon AE-1).  8. It has a useful built in flash. 9. The mpeg video mode is useful (it captures the sound as well)  10. Quality of the pictures at 1040x768 was good to very good (enough for the web) Would I buy it? I would consider buying a newer model, the MVCCD1000 Digital Camera, with a three inch CD-R drive for the 3.5 inch floppy drive - vastly increasing the camera's image capacity.  I would like a wider angle model, but I will still borrow the Mavica FD95 when I go back to Jamaica.  The camera would be well suited to studio work.","Having decided to purchase a digital camera for our small architecture firm, we debated about the importance of the various features available. The two criteria which ultimately led to the FD95 were the ability to write on standard diskettes and the resolution of 2.1 Megapixels. (The diskette requirement limits the choice to Sony). Regardless of the validity of our criteria, I can safely say that we are satisfied with the purchase, having used it now for several months.<br />The advantage of the diskettes is debatable. We like their simplicity and the ease of transfer to a computer. On the down side, the capacity is small. This is readily apparent when taking high resolution shots (four shot per disk). For job-site photos, the 30 shots per diskette capacity is adequate. As for the debate, I have heard that using a high-capacity flash memory card and a USB connection is an equally convenient method of transfer. Perhaps so. Sony does provide for the use of a \"Memory Stick\" with the FD95 with an adapter, which can then be simply inserted into a disk drive.<br />Although the resolution is not the best available, it is more than adequate for our uses: job-site record snap shots and promotional brochure photos. For these, we use the lowest and highest resolutions, respectively.<br />The ease-of-use is good, with the feature menus being relatively intuitive. The feature list is also impressive, though many are not particulary applicable to our needs (the video feature falls in the \"neat-o\" category). We are particarly pleased with the quality of the optics and the optical zoom capability. The camera has a nice heft and feels solidly constructed, a feature that is important in our application.<br />One downside to the camera is its bulk, but this is directly attributable to the diskette memory feature and the professional-quality optics. Another minor criticism is the inability to control how the files are named; it would be nice to \"wildcard\" the sequnetially-numbered names with a job-specific prefix.<br />Overall, we would recommend this camera to anyone who had similar criteria as our own. If compactness is the primary concern, look elsewhere. If you can justify the expense, consider the Sony model that writes to CD-RW.","This camera takes great pictures for beginners.  The zoom lens gets some great shots of nature and a couple adjustments you can take some great pictures at night (cityscapes etc.)  The floppy feature makes the pictures readily available to be used on almost any computer (no cable hookups) and easily sent on email. I've used this camera at work and for recreation.  I took pictures of the George Washington Bridge at night and, when zooming in with the computer media, you can make the rivets out.  Expect pictures to be a little choppy on poor video card computers but not the camera's fault. Also the photo software is weak. Most importantly...... it's fun.","I had bought my first camera, a Pentax, in 1965 and graduated up to the Nikon family. Being immersed in black and white processing for years and needing a new camera I weighed getting a new Nikon and all the darkroom equipment necessary for color processing.<br />Since I am a photo hobbyist, I was unable to justify the expense of the equipment plus having to buy a new set of lenses. The Sony Mavica with its SLR viewfinder capability struck me as an ideal compromise. You are able to actually view what will be taken while the LCD allows those surreptitious candid people shots.<br />It is great being able to down load pictures into my iMac and manipulate color balance, crop, and electronically 'dodge' the darker areas to achieve what your mind's eye saw when taking it. The Sony supplied software is a waste of a CD, though. Get Photoshop to really use the capabilities of this camera.<br />There are a load of features which make this camera ideal for both portraiture and landscape photography. But it is also eminently suited for those quick snap shots.<br />Having a true 10X optical zoom with a compound lens lends itself to nearly any situation . I rarely use the digital zoom although, with its higher than average CCD size and pixel count, little resolution is lost.<br />All in all, a great camera for the ardent hobbyist as well as the casual user. It will have longevity in the digital camera field.<br />Okay, there are two detractions to an otherwise great product... the manual leaves much to be desired and the battery charge connector is very touchy.","I got mine from Amazon a few months ago. I had a 73 and moved up to the Mvc-FD95. Couldn't be happier. I Never leave home without it. I have no gripes with the camera. I still use 35MM and 120 when necessary, but lean to Sony for most day to day shots. I have not found another camera I would swap it for as digitals go. If you are looking for \"The\" digital camera this is it! The 3.5 floppies are easy to work with and you can change resolution at a moments notice. It will have to pried from my hands!","Pros: Great features include 10x optical zoom (incredible!), viewfinder LCD, photo size adj, mic and MPG recordign ability for quick little videos.<br />Cons: Bulky, battery power can go fast if using a lots of features.<br />Overall, I'd get this Mavica again. Good stuff from Sony!","Although somewhat bulky, this Mavica has a superb set of features among which one of the most beneficial to me is the eye level viewfinder with an LCD inside which eliminates the problem of viewing the screen when in bright sun such as encountered in the tropics. The FD-95 also gives the user the ability to adjust his or her photo file size to suit their end uses as well as to maximize the average number of shots per floppy disc. Its 10X optical zoom affords greater utilization which most other cameras do not offer. Built in mic and MPEG recording capability can be useful in some situations. Compatibility of its batteries with SONY digital video cameras is another benefit to the user, reducing the number of accessories required to carry for charging them when traveling abroad.","We bought the camera in early December, a last minute splurge before our trip to Asia over the holidays. My only instructions came from a brief review of the manual but it was enough to take advantage of many of the features of the MVC-FD95 camera. The operation became second nature to me in no time. My wife, a true techni-phobe was able to operate it with great results with only a few seconds of instruction and felt very comfortable using it (unlike the VCR). One of the silliest (yet impressive) pictures I took on the trip was from the crosswalk between the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur of our hotel in the distance. Using the full zoom, it brought the hotel into the viewfinder and with the steadyshot activated, made the picture seem like it was taken from a block away. To appreciate the picture you would have to see the shot from that distance without the use of any zoom. I took some beautiful macro shots of orhids and other exotic flowers with unbelievable colour and clarity. The camera was a luxury for us, however I am as thrilled with it now as when I first used it and just wish I had more time to fully discover the features. I read several reviews of this and other brands and although I was a bit concerned about the size, I have had no regrets. The floppy disk system is fantastic. Take the 3.5, put it in the floppy drive of your computer and you have the images ready for posting or editing. On our trip, I used it under some extreme conditions, high humidity and temperatures without any problems. I feel very comfortable recommending this camera.","Howdi,  I got it couple of months ago and I must admit that it's great in terms of image resolution and quality. The like taking this camera to any concerts or shows and you have all the images on floppy..share it with people or publish on the net..just great. and on top it supports image stabilization just like my other Sony TRV87 and i can exchange batteries between them.<br />The only thing which I don't like that much are the big size of this..due to 3-1/2 inch floppy and MPEG movie.. which is not very good in quality if you are moving the camera very fast and I don't even make many mpeg's out of this. Otherwise, it's so much fun using this and since I'm into photography, it let's me publish some photos online, quickly.","I must say I love this camera.  It is so easy to use. What surprised me is the incredible image quality of close-up pictures in the macro-mode.  I knew i wanted a camera that accepted floppy disks and Sony is the only company that offers this. To me, the convienence of floppy disks outweighs the need to carry multiple disks. I cant think of a downside to this camera except: 1.  Forget about taking action shots, too slow in taking picture. 2.  Flash is underpowered, lighting is critical to good shots.<br />Those are my only complaints.  This camera offers so many user friendly features, i cant list them all here.  Pricey, but worth it.","I was very disappointed when I finally decided to purchase a digital camera and was unable to get the Sony FD-91 that my brother and friend both owned. I had used their cameras and loved what it could do but couldn't find it anywhere.  The only thing close was the FD-95. Although a bit pricier, I have not been disappointed in the camera.  I have gotten excellent results from it and was surprised at how light it is despite its deceptive looks.  It's very easy to handle and operate.  I highly recommend this camera, even for a veritable novice like myself.  The only downside I have found is something that was pointed out in another review -- it is slow when taking a picture.  You really have to hold that button down to get it to take and it makes taking my hockey action shots a bit of a challenge.  If that is the only thing that I can see as a problem, though, do yourself a favor and pick up one of these cameras.  You won't be disappointed.","A friend just came by on his motorcycle. I took one look at his grizzled face and went for my camera. I put one candle in front of him and started filling a disc (Why not? Or two or ...). I had riased exposure level to the max (2) and found the candle was too bright. Though what I saw in the LCD was visible but murky the recorded image was too clear to really appear like candle light. Very user friendly, just \"waste\" shots and learn what works. Have used a tripod for night shots without flash and was pleased with the color quality as well as optical zoom feature.","If you are considering a jump from your trusty old SLR to digital, this camera is the reason to do it.  The ability to review a shot right after taking it, reshoot it if you like, and then email the image home is fantastic.  Any digital camera can do that, but this one gives you ease of use, sound annotation, remarkable quality of images, great zoom capability, and worthwhile advanced features as well.<br />This camera is ready to travel.  The batteries recharge quickly in the camera off 110V US or 220V European style outlets with the cables provided.  Also, any computer shop can move your images from floppies to a CD for cheap.  You might also be able to upload your images to a web site.  You don't need to carry 400 disks on a long trip as you can reuse them.<br />Limitations:<br />- This is not a small, unobtrusive camera.  The FD-95 is comparable in size to a big SLR.  You'll need to carry floppies also, so plan on a bag.<br />- I have had a 2% failure rate writing images to floppies.  (Might be the disks.  Buy good disks!)<br />- Action shots are harder as the image capture is slower than with an SLR.  You'll need to anticipate your shot.<br />- The placement of the LCD view screen is perfect for catching nose prints.<br />- No JPEG viewer/editor is provided, though you can download a great one from CompuPic for ($).<br />- No case is provided.  (See bag, above.)<br />- No warranty comes in the box.  5 year third-party warranties are about ($).<br />- Only one battery pack is provided.  The NP-F550 pack outlasts the NP-F330 supplied with the camera and runs about($).<br />- The manual covers only function.  Amazon's camera page will teach you the rest about digital cameras.<br />- Consider buying a CD burner if you take lots of photos.  ($).<br />Even with the issues noted above, this is a great camera.  Enjoy your new toy!  You won't look back.","This Sony mvc-fd95 has produced some very good pictures. It allows you to  use it as a 35 mm camera.  I am not sure that i would have purchased the  wide angle lens for it, while it does give you a near 28mm wide angle  affect, it is a little fuzzy. The camera it self is very forgiving, have  shot pics of bats flying at dusk, deer nursing in the woods, machine  screens at work, indian pipes growing in the woods.  A really nice camera,  Amazon's service was excellent as usually.","I first saw this at a high school reunion.  I was impressed with the features my friend was doing on it, and that's what got me hooked.  I looked around and did a little comparison shopping and decided on the  MVC-FD95.  I like the feel of it (feels like my old 35mm Minolta) and it  was extremely easy to use.  I feel this camera has a slew of features that  make it very attractive.  The viewfinder and the LCD screen are very easy  to work with and the menus are easy to navigate also.  The MPEG movie  feature with audio are also nice too.  Primarily I was impressed with the  1600 x 1200 image size.  Shots came out really clear and crisp.  The built  in flash is adequate but it at least lets you hook up an external flash.  Probably the downside for some (but not necessarily for me) is the floppy  disk memory, meaning you can only put approx 4 shots of hi-resolution shots  on disk before its full.  However, I look at it as not a big deal, because  floppy disks are cheap and I carry a bundle in my bag anyway.  Plus floppy  disks can go directly into your computer's disk drive (an advantage for  me). The main limiting factor could be price... .  But this camera is  extremely easy to use and I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of mine.  Sony  also has a lot more features on it that I didn't mention, but go to the  store and look (and play) with one and compare it!  Good Luck!","After taking days worth of pictures, I enjoyed how easy it was to use. The zoom is the fun part when you zoom in the people's faces while you're at around 25 meters from them.<br />Pros :<br />-Too easy to use. Just points and shoot.<br />-Floppy disks are [inexpensive] and simple to manipulate. Just insert the disk, copy, and \"voilà\". Some people prefer buying compact flash cards because of their size, but when they realize they have room to spare, money was wasted.<br />-It takes excellent pictures. Bad pictures are made by the user, not by the camera.<br />-Zoom, zoom, zoom.<br />Cons :<br />-I wish it could take pictures faster.<br />-The compatibility with memory sticks is useless when their prices are so high. I end up paying 10 bucks the meg and it isn't faster with sticks.<br />-The batteries are expensive. They are drained after more than 90 shots at 1024x768.<br />I love to take landscape pictures and clouds as wallpaper. Buying a 3 mega pixel camera with a 3x zoom(optical) and 2x zoom(digital) is nothing compared to this one, because you can't even zoom in to see someone's face near you and you will get mad when the subject is too far away.<br />Last words : night shots are darker than expected, but when you reduce the images' brightness, you could see more details. Go to a retailer store and see it for yourself. It may be heavy and big, but what could you expect from such a great camera. My second choice of camera would be those tiny ones with 3 mega pixel and 64 megs, because of it's size and speed.<br />You can email me to see some pictures I have taken.","The new Sony MVC-FD95 digital camera is one of the best. I have the older model the FD-91 and love it; the only two things I would like added were  added to the new FD-95. One was the limited flash. They have added a hot  shoe for an external flash and it now gives you the same indoor flash  quality as the old SDL cameras. The other was the somewhat low DPI. The  olderFD-91 was at 1024 x 768 the new FD-95 is way up at 1600 x 1200. With  this amount of Dpi you can print a full 8-1/2 x 11 picture that truly looks  like a photo. The new eye viewer is centered in the camera and has a wider  opening with eyeglass correction focus. The mike for Audio in located on  the front as before it was on top, and is more sensitive. I do miss the  moveable LCD for self-portraits, but not many of them taken anyway! The  steady shot is a must and was one of the best features. I used it all the  time, when you are on the10x~20x it is a must. The new FD-95 now has a date  and/or time stamping on the picture that can be used or eliminated. This  might be useful for showing the correct time or date as the file  information could be changed. The only con's I have found is the battery  charging system. I liked the old separate charger that you could charge a  battery as you are away using the camera, but then you can buy the extra  battery charger as an accessory. Now you have to leave the battery in the  camera and hook up the charging system to the camera. The other was the  video mode; it is only 15 seconds now. I liked the 60-sec. mode on the  older FD-91, but the larger format is nice. The camera style is a little  more compact and well balanced. The new date and time stamping is a nice  added feature.","The new Sony MVC-FD95 digital camera is one of the best.

The macro function on this camera is awesome. The memory sticks are so cool because I can put five in my pocket without having them bulk up my pockets.  The night time photo shoot functions are superior to any 35mm I have ever used and my photos print with such detail, there is no way I will give up this camera to a 35mm.","Fantastic camera for the price.  I researched several camera's before purchasing the Sony DSC-30. Picture resolution at 640 is very clear and printable for framing.  On a 4MB stick I was able to take over 40 pictures.  I did purchase the camera pack and got a 8mb, plus the 16MB.  Have not had to use yet.  Battery pack last a long time.  Great flash allowing you to take pictures in any environment.  Sorry if some of the users are having difficult gettting desired results, but reading the directions prior to use helps tremendously.  Highly recommend.","I am new to the Digital Camera field, my other camera being a Cannon A1 35MM.  I needed something to shoot small antique car emblems for my web site.  These are especially difficult (even with the Cannon, using a macro zoom lens) because they are highly reflective on the surface and in the imbedded metallic colors.  The Sony DSC-S30 just fell into my lap due to Office Depot closing their local stores and clearing out everything at greatly reduced prices.  Regardless, the camera is all I could ask for.  I mount it on a tripod and connect it to a 13\" color tv through the video out cable, and can experiment with the lighting, positioning etc. to get just the effect I want.  Even the SLR's can't do that.  What you see on the tv screen is what you really get.  So now I am getting awesome closeup shots. I've even put a plug on my web page for this camera, so people will know how I came to have such great shot!  The only negative is with the Sony corp. itself.  I was unable to order any accesories with my \"rebate\", because the phone number is always busy.  Once I did get through, waited on hold for 30 min. and the item was not in stock (the cameral case).  So I am disgruntled with them!","This is a great camera, I have taken lots of pictures and they all have great quality, the battery life is great, almost 3 hours (like 1 and a half using the flash).  The availñable image modes (5) make your pictures look even better.  The zoom is much more than other cameras have.<br />The CONS of the camera that I could mention are: The lack of the optical viewfinder (can be fixed by adjusting the bright) The small memory in the included memory stick (Sony has an offer of a 16 mb free with mail in rebate)<br />Wether you are a photo etusiastic or you just want to take family pictures this is a great camera, to see how professional my pics look check out<br />[...]  (professional pics) [...]  (family-like pics)","SONY only provides USB driver for Windows 98.  Don't buy this product if you have Windows 95.  Or you'll have the same problem as I do now.  Your options are to upgrade to Windows 98 or buy the floppy disk adapter.  Either way, you'll be spending more money.  As for me, I'm returning the camera.  Too bad, because I like the camera itself.","I recently got this camera at a really good price. Before I purchased it, I did alot of research. I'm really happy with the choice I made. The picture quality is great, and the features make a picture ...interesting... The menu system is really easy. It is a great camera for a first-time-user.","This is my first digital camera and for folks who are like me, too lazy to organize photos and sometimes even getting films developed, I think digital is the way to go. The best part is being able to delete unwanted on-the-fly and edit the pictures at home afterwards. The camera is easy to use for a non-techie. The battery has an incredibly long life. I bought an additional battery for my trip to Thailand and never really had to use the backup (of course, I recharged every night). Another good feature, the charger is also universal (can be used or both 110 and 220 volts). In the case of Thailand, no outlet adapter was needed. The zoom is great. Deleting photos using is a little difficult for me, I had removed the wrong photos a couple of times. My biggest complaint is that the memory stick is still quite pricey. I would like to get the 64 MB one but I am going to wait for the price to come down a little more.<br />Also if you don't know this already, the USB port is not compatible with Windows NT. I had to get a diskette adapter for my NT laptop which requires a driver installation from the CD but the USB worked really well for my Windows 98 PC at home. Being able to show the pictures on TV using the sony-provided TV adapter was also a nice feature although I don't use it too often.","I have had the S30 now for 3 weeks. for home use I dont think you can beat it for the price.  The only flaw if you can call it that is you need to get a larger memory stick. The 4meg that comes with the camera is not enough.  You can get the case that is made for it from Sony for $25 including 2nd day air shiping.","I recently purchased this camera after doing three months of research on digital camera technology. I must say that for the price of this camera it is very, very, very hard to beat. I took this camera with me on a ski trip just this last week and I couldn't believe the quality of the pictures. This camera is totally awesome and the pictures even look better than my friends Mavica FD-85 that he paid almost 200 dollars more for. The television out capability is awesome. Me and my wife snapped up a bunch of photos at the ski resort and came right back to the room and looked at them. The camera could use a viewfinder but I will tell you this. For the image quality, battery performance, plus the offered storage capcity through Sony's memory stick; I wouldn't have another camera. The camera is simply terrific and compact enough to be fesable to carry but not to small to be a problem to hold on to. By all means purchase at least a 32MB memory stick. For the average shot shooter, this will be plenty for you to work with. The USB feature is also a great added benefit to this camera. 900 kb/s transfer speeds blow away slower serial connections. If you are in the market as a first time digital camera buyer. Look no further, you won't find a better, more powerful and feature rich camera than this one for the price. Way to go Sony!","I know that this camera is worth every penny.I have had a couple of digital cameras. I've had the mvs-fd90 and it was a waste of money this camera does the same things and its very simple to use.So far this is the best camera for me.....","This camera is great for the beginner digital camera enthusiast.  I got this camera as a present last Spring and enjoyed it thoroughly, taking it on a trip to Italy.  If you want to see samples, please email me and I'll send you links to these pictures.  The pictures it takes are wonderful, bright, vibrant colors, great contrast, etc.  That should be the main thing to be concerned about when starting out.  One of the best things other than the image itself was the flexible lcd viewfinder.  You can twist it around in every which way, making it ideal for taking candid shots.  Another great feature is the infolithium battery which lasts forever (the person who said he had problems with his must have had a defective one) and constantly tells you how much time you have left before it needs to be recharged.  The menu system is a snap.  The camera is compact enough to fit in a coat pocket.  Obviously for a lower-resolution, lower-end camera, you're not going to find high-end features like manual modes, etc., but you do at least have some flexibility in terms of flash and exposure modes.  Another downside, though easily fixed with some extra money is the included 4mb memory stick.  You really need more if you want to take more than a few shots.  Obviously you can decrease the resolution which increases the number of shots you can take, and although these lesser-resolution pics are clear, they may not be suitable for printing.  At the highest resolution, 4x6 prints come out nicely, but lower resolutions produce prints that are not very good.  The other side of this is that memory sticks are proprietary to Sony products.  So in order to take full advantage of the medium, your MP3 player and PDA would have to be Sony products as well, so that you could use the sticks interchangably.  Sony still hasn't learned their lesson from Betamax or Minidiscs, but that's another issue.  Yes, speed is also an issue.  It takes quite a while to take a picture after hitting the shutter release, and even longer to take another one after the shot.  As long as you don't primarily take pictures of kids (or other fast moving objects ;-) this camera is great!","I just purchased the DSC-S30.  I had seriously considered the Olympus 460Z, which costs about the same price.  While both cameras have 3x Optical zoom and TV out, the similarities end there.  First, a national consumer magazine rated the S30 one of the best 1.3 mega pixel cameras.  Second, you have to consider the accessories that come bundled with this camera.  You get a rechargeable lithium ion battery, an AC Adaptor, and a USB cable that when connected to your computer, makes your camera act like a hard drive.  You can even upload images to the camera so you can take them with you.  We love hooking up the camera to the TV!! The features are nearly endless, and the picture quality is very impressive.  I can't say enough about this camera.  Sony even has a rebate program where you can essentially get an extra 16MB memory stick for free.  Sony's new Cybershot line is something everyone should seriously consider.","I just recently got the Sony DSC-S30 and I can't put the thing down.  I think the reviewers that had problems with the battery life and the amount of pictures that can be taken possibly did not take time to read the instruction manual.  This camera has many settings that you can choose from to manipulate how many pictures you can store at a time.  Of course if you go with the highest quality you will undoubtedly get less pictures.  This can be solved by getting an extra memory stick, or going for lower grade pictures, which are still crystal clear.  This camera has many options that will make a novice photographer look like a pro.  There are many picture effects to choose from.  You can take black & white photos, sepia colored (to look old fashioned), redirect light sources and shadows, and much much more.  The movable LCD display is great, you can even turn it backwards and take a picture of yourself.  Antoher great feature that my family has used, is hooking it up to the TV.  Using this we took a self portrait with the timer and we could reposition ourselves and preview the picture by looking at the television.  Technology is so cool.  I'm glad we didn't take our salesman's advise and go with a \"starter\" camera -because we are young-, I would not have been happy.  Nobody gives you more cool options and buttons than Sony.  Great Camera- but now I wish I had gotten the DSC-S50, for the movie feature.  One thing I know for sure...I'll never go back to using film, and having strangers develop my pictures.","The Sony DSC-S30, really a wonderful and enjoyable little camera. This is my first digital camera after having a few 35mm cameras after my name. Although Digital cameras still has a while to go before having that absolute sharpness than the 35mm cameras, they are not far off. Taking pictures is almost second nature now, so wonderful not worrying about films and the cost of development (In South Africa development is not cheap). I really recommend the Sony for all Photo lovers. The LCD screen can be turned in almost every direction to make taking photos a breeze in difficult positions. I would recommend that you buy an extra Memory Stick. At least a 32MB or better a 64 MB stick, and if you are on the road a lot, buy an extra battery. (I must say the battery that Sony supplies are great, last more than 3 hours continuely and it really recharges very fast.) I really only have good things to say about the Sony, gives me lots of joy privately and wonderful little work horse when it comes to taking pictures for my Web Designing company....","i have been shopping for a digital camera for about 9 months and the dsc30 is the best value.  it produces great quality pics.  the battery life is awesome--watch out for anyother camera with regular AA's you'll be luck to get 15 flash photos on it. with this camera i got over 100 photos on a rechargeable battery!","I just purchased this one for a trip to Greece, Egypt, and Israel. I was very pleased with the battery life. I'd plug it in every night and it would last all day with no problem. The picture quality is excellent during the day and night. If you make the purchase, you'll need another memory stick. I got the 64 meg stick (Ken Tracey) and could take 112 shots at the highest resolution.  I blew up a few of my pictures to 8x10 and the quality was quite good. If your planning on doing that though, I'd recommend the 2.1 meg Sony. All in all, I'm a happy camper","This is a great camera for the price and size.  Dump the 4MB memory card and get at least a 16MB.  As stated above, low light and action photography is pushing this camera to the limits, but it is hard to beat for 90% of what most people would use it for.  Transfer rates to the computer using the USB interface are quite fast.  The only things that would keep me from giving this camera a 5 star rating are the lack of a viewfinder other than the LCD display, the slow shutter, and the outragiously high price of Sony accessories.  Also, the $599 list price is misleading.  It can be ordered direct from Sony for $499, and I have seen it for less locally.","I wanted a liteweight camera to go on vacation with and the Sony DSC-S30 was the camera for the job.  Not only was the S30 able to give a long battery life (I never ran out, just recharged at the hotel) but the Sony power adapter was useful with overseas voltage.  The same power adapter is the same one that charges and runs my Sony Digital camera as well. Many people in my tour group were amazed at this 'wonderful' package, as I was able to show people instantly what the picture looked like. When I got back from vacationing I e-mailed pictures to some of the people in our tour and the overall reaction to the quality was great! The disk that comes with the camera has many interesting effects as in photoshop. I would recommend this camera highly for anyone who wants a great camera at a great price. Thanks again Sony!","I bought this camera after some comparison shopping, and was surprised to  find features that aren't commented on in most reviews.  In addition to  what others have already said, I really like the video out feature, which  allows you to watch a slide show of your pix on a regular TV.  I was a  litte worried about the quality of a 1.3 megapixel camera, but I have made  good-looking 8x10 prints after a little enhancement in photoshop.<br />This  camera can pre-focus (like a real 35mm SLR) which shotens the time it takes  to take a picture from the moment you press the shutter release to the time  the picture is captured.  Just press the shutter down about  half-way.<br />Documentation is excellent, quality and build are first-rate,  and I would recommend this camera if you are shopping for a camera in this  price range.","This is a great camera with a wonderful variety of features for the money. The use of this camera is intuitive - within 10 minutes I had more or less  figured it all out, and only really needed the manual for reference.  Battery life is good, with the supplied rechargeable battery. The camera  will take colour, B/W or sepia shots in a wide variety of resolutions.  Webheads may appreciate the camera's auto-thumbnail feature, where a  thumbnail image can be created and stored along with the high resolution  shot. The camera feels solid, and well, camera shaped, unlike some other  cameras I looked at. Sony did a great job here.<br />Advice:<br />Buy another  memory stick or 2. The 4MB supplied doesn't go very far in the highest  resolution (7 images!). Buy a 32MB (57 images) or 64 MB (~114). The memory  sticks can also be used in a few other Sony products as well, so will be a  good investment for Sony fans.<br />Gripes:<br />1)The camera's built in flash  isn't wonderful, and the lack of optical viewfinder means that taking shots  in the dark is guesswork, as you can't see much in the display. The higher  end DC-S70 has a viewfinder which would help here.<br />2)The delay when  taking a shot makes this camera difficult to use for action  shots.<br />Overall:<br />If you want a high resolution camera for mainly daytime  non-action shots that is easy to use, feature rich, with good memory  expansion and generally well designed then buy this camera. If you expect a  lot of low light or action use, then it's probably best to shop around.","This Camera is a great feature packed camera. With the higher capacity memory sticks you can shoot your brains out (not literally of course). The  image quality at all image sizes are great. The aperture and shutter  priority along with the spot metering and manual focus presets work  awesome. I really like the effects; sepia, b&w, posturize and neg art.  The only downfall to this strong camera is the speed it takes to capture an  image. All in all really happy about this one.","this is the first digital camera we have owened and we love it. the  optional 64 meg card is highly recommended for any pictures on trips. the  64 meg card holds about 120 shots on the 1024 mode. along with this we  bought the HP932c printer and together they are unbeatable. buy it you will  love it","This camera is an excellent mid-range product that is option-packed.  Even the low rez pics are high quality; I've got an HP 952c printer, and unless  you look close, you can't tell that you're looking at a digital picture.  Editing pictures on the fly is a snap.  The only complaints I would have is  the low 4MB Memory stick it comes with, and it's a little slow when taking  action shots (for an extreme amateur photographer like me, I need every  advantage I can get!).  Sony continues to have my vote for high quality  electronics.","This is the first digital camera that I have owned, and I love it.  It  takes spectacular daytime shots, including landscape and action shots.  Low  light situations leave much to be desired.  This is one of the few reasons  I didn't give four stars.  The aperature settings are so small that it is  difficult to get low-light shots that aren't blurry.  The moonlight  settings are nice, but keep the shutter open for almost a second; if you  don't have a tripod, it is tough to hold still long enough.  Also, forget  about the 4meg card that comes with the camera, invest in at least a 32 meg  card.  I bought a 64 meg memory stick and I can take about 95 pictures at  1280X760, which is great.  I find that the space runs out at about the same  time as the batteries do under normal use, which is perfect.  I also love  the free-moving LCD screen.  It comes in handy all the time.  It also helps  to protect the screen from scratches.  Although i've only had the camera  for about 3 months, I am very pleased so far.  I highly recommend this  camera."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-S50","amazon_reviews":["I purchased my SonyDSC-S50 in the late 90's and it has been outstanding.  Never gives me any problems and the battery seems to last forever.","I had one of these Cameras and The first time I took a picture with that one ,I ws stunned by how it came out ,That 1 got ruined by accidently getting wet ,so searched for another and it does great Job taking pictures","Bought it new in 2000 and at the time digital was just getting hot. For 900 bucks today you can go buy a dslr. But 12 years ago this was hot. I will honestly say after working with many many different cameras this one still blows away most point and shoot. Now there are reasons and some flaws. No viewfinder just a screen. 2.1mp can be found on anything now but the lens is what really makes it. The macro mode is better than ANY point and shoot I've ever used period. I can get 1/4\" away and it'll still focus with a super sharp clear picture. I've tried a $1,200 point and shoot macro and it was put to shame. The guys at the camera store literally couldn't believe their eyes. Battery life of 2+ days, seriously that is just great. For 50 bucks there is no reason not to put this in your arsenal of gear. The macro alone is worth the 900 I paid.","I bought this camera 11 years ago. It has taken over 100,000 pictures for me and I use it everyday. I am an eBay power seller, and I have never had the need to buy another. I am still blown away by some of the close up pictures I have taken with this little gem, and will prolly buy one on eBay if this little work horse ever dies.","It's now obviously long after this piece of antiquated hardware's life cycle, yet here I am writing a review for it. Why? Well read on to find out what's so special about this old Cybershot.<br /><br />In short, this thing is built like a brick. It has hung around for nearly a decade of constant use and abuse at my hands, and it's still kicking. I can't count the number of times I've forgotten to put on the oh-so-useful wrist strap and watch this camera fall three or more feet to hard concrete, only to pick it up and keep on going like nothing had happened.<br />Its 2.1 megapixels are certainly low-end by now, with even my shiny new cell phone's camera outdoing it with a 3.2 MP built-in camera, but there's no beating having a full-size camera when you're taking photos. And besides, unless you plan to make literal wallpaper out of your vacation photos to Sea World, what's the big deal with having 6+ megapixels anyways? Proper composition beats computer editing any day in my book- you can't use Photoshop to change the fact that Dad sucks at taking photos, you can only make it less apparent...<br /><br />The LCD display is both a blessing and a curse- it's great to have a backlit display preview, but the lack of an optical viewfinder makes it a pain to set up shots in bright light. The single best thing about the screen though is the free rotation. I have yet to see another camera with this feature, and until I do I plan to keep this thing handy. Even when you aren't using it to take shots, it's useful since you can turn the LCD inwards, preventing any damage to the screen while the camera isn't in use, which has been the death of so many of my sister's newer cameras.<br /><br />The battery life on this thing has been great for me. I have not replaced the original battery, but still get over 120 minutes of use out of the InfoLithium M battery that shipped with it, not including any excessive use of the flashbulb.<br /><br />It's got a decent set of built-in controls, considering it was designed as a point-and-shoot camera. There's a number of effects to apply pre-shot, as well as brightness sensitivity, focus, etc.<br /><br />The Memory Sticks this device is capable of come in sizes up to 128 megabytes (I have not had any success in getting it to accept anything more recent such as the ProDuo line) but today you can pick up boxes of the 128 MB sticks from online dealers for next to nothing, so you'll never run out of storage space. On top of that, it takes quite a respectable number of photos (or not so many MPEG videos/voice recordings)  to fill up single 128MB memory stick, so you won't be swapping out the card every five minutes unless you're taking photos about once every two seconds.<br /><br />Seriously, the mere fact that this camera still gets the job done nearly ten years after its initial release says something about the quality of it. If Sony were to make their current cameras with this durability I might consider buying one.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you could find this camera for sale new today, and didn't mind the low resolution (or trying to find working Vista drivers...) then definitely go for it.","I no longer own this Camera, having at the time purchased what I thought was a better new camera.  That new camera still doesn't shoot as good of pictures as this Sony.  I took the this on my backpacking trip to Europe in 2001 and most of the pictures were incredible some were even poster quality.  Unfortunately it is only 2MP so there's no way it would print poster sized prints but the quality is there.  I miss my old Sony Camera, so I have recently upgraded again to a new Sony HX1, here's hoping todays top of the line Sony P&S matches the quality of its way back predecessor.","This was the first digital camera I ever owned and I stumbled across the amazon page for it and realized I never wrote a review for it, and it certainly deserves the glaring review I'm about to give it.<br /><br />I own 3 other digital cameras now that I have bought for various reasons (smaller, slr capabilities, large (3.0\" viewfinder) ) and while I am happy with them, none of them deliver more consistently impressive pictures in any surrounding you can think of like the Sony DSC-S50 does.<br /><br />What I am most happy with when it comes to this camera is its night shots. It takes amazong low light shots, I have taken so many incredible pictures at concerts and outdoors (las vegas) with it.<br /><br />The viewfinder is an incredible feature that guarantees perfectly framed self portrait shots, overhead shots, waist high shots, basically you can take a picture from an angle high or low and frame it perfectly because of the viewfinders ability to rotate.<br /><br />Now 2-megapixels isn't the greatest six years later, but I have printed and framed many 5x7's and even 8x10's from this camera (and other megapixel cams) and been very happy with their results and visitors to my home have always asked what kind of camera I took them with and are shocked it was with my trsuty six-year old 2 megapixel S-50.<br /><br />It is a little bulky by todays standards, but it is VERY durable. I have dropped and knocked around this camera for years and it still performs like new (save for one little plasitic knick near the arrow keys that doesn't effect functionality at all).<br /><br />The camera comes with one batterie and when I purchased it originally I bought an extra camera. To this day, they hold a very long charge and sonys battery feature that tells you down to the minute how much time is left on the battery is an incredible feature.<br /><br />The video clips can only record 15seconds at a time (with audio too) but I've fond that is just long enough for a fairly brisk \"happy birthday\" song!<br /><br />I cannot reccomend this camera enough for overall picture quality, functionality, eas-of-use and espeically for those on a budget. Memory Sticks in a suitable capacity for this camera are dirt cheap, and the camera itself is very affordable now.","I'm just now writing this review after I bought this camera used on Ebay and years later.  I have nothing but great things to say about it...<br /><br />- It has held up through the worst abuse with me.  Even survived a few concrete drops.  Construction is awsome.<br /><br />- Optics are great.  I can get about 5in from an object before it gets blurry; and that is enough to get fine print off of something in great detail.  Zoom control is great once you get the hang of it.  Moving objects are usually no problem and you do not have to hold the camera extra-steady to aboid blurring either.<br /><br />- Colors are vibrant in most any light source.  I rarely have to mess with the brightness/contrast in PShop.  I don't know how, but image quality rivals 5 MP cameras that I've used.  I actually bought a Casio Exilim 5MP and resold it right away to stick with this.<br /><br />- Swivel LCD is useful for personal photos.  No dead pixels or problems with the LCD after years of USE!<br /><br />- Aftermarket batteries are $10 and work great.

Unless you plan to enlarge your photos to 8\" x 10\" (and would need more pixels), I recommend this camera whole-heartedly.<br /><br />Last week, I used a friend's adorable, new Olympus Stylus Verve and I couldn't believe the difference in photo quality.  This old Sony takes pictures 100 times better.  It's also very easy to use, has a large LCD display that rotates--so you can turn it inward when not in use (protecting the screen) and you can take pictures of yourself without any guesswork.<br /><br />It's a great camera.  Grab one while you can.","My dad was the one who first bought this Sony Cybershot. At the time he used it a lot but now he's letting me have a go at it. The zoom is phenomenal and the 2.1 MP resolution is perfect, and allows the photos to be crisp and clinical. It can take reasnable MPEG movies and is very simple to use. Downloading the pictures onto computer proves to be quick and simple. The LCD screen is flexible allowing you better photos from awkward positions. The only small draw-back is that the shutter takes a bit too long too catch a fast moving object such as a bird. This camera was a really pleasent experience for me!","Bought this camera for my brother and DSC-S70 for myself, I just loved this one more than mine(DSC-S70)for which I evantually paid almost $250.00 more. It has all simple and great features and even my 9yr old son operates it like a pro. I like the LCD on DSC-50 cause it's more protected from scratches and picture quality is not different than DSC-70 on even 8 X 10 size prints.  I strongly recommand DSC-50 over DSC-S70(or on anyother 2 or more megapixel digital camera), for the pic quality, ease of use & price.","As an amateur photographer and freelance web designer, I've always been particular about the quality of my photos as the camera captures them - and how well they will translate for web use. I'm as particular about my digital cameras as I am about my film cameras. This camera is my third digital camera purchase in 4 years, and I'm FINALLY happy!<br />The quality of the images for both print and web use is excellent! (Hint: Jump on the Ofoto offer - it's well worth it!) The ability of the camera to go up to large formats - 1600 x 1200 - gives you the ability to print up to 20\" x 30\" photos. The 72 dpi assures you that there will be no wasted file size or web space when used for the web.<br />Even though this camera is lightweight and compact, it has the power to get incredible focus and detail on small objects as well as larger objects caught with the 6x zoom - tripod suggested for zoom photos, as it would be with any other camera. I don't like to leave the house without a camera, but don't always want to carry my bulky cam bag with me - The Sony DSC-S50 is the perfect size to drop into my purse or briefcase!<br />The filter effects let me shoot the same scene in several different modes - B&W, Sepia, etc. This is a nice feature for artistic experiments, but a little cumbersome in getting there. Effects reset to standard mode when you shut the camera off, which can be annoying when trying to compose and focus while using filter effects.<br />Sony could have cut the price of the camera (or included a larger capacity Memory Stick) by not including the MPEG movie feature, and some of the filters. The MPEGS are nice, good quality, but limited on time/size when using a smaller size Memory Stick and IMPO, don't need to be on a still camera.<br />Best advice I can give for this camera is order a 32mb or larger Memory Stick when ordering the camera. The 4mb stick that comes with it is useless if shooting large size images.<br />Yes, the camera is totally worth the price! Buy it!","I have had mine for over a year now and it still works great.  It comes with a good long lasting battery the NP-FM50.<br />My only complaint is that the included memory stick is only 4MB.  At high resolution (1600x1200) you would only be able to take about 4 pictures.  I bought a 64MB stick the very same day and have had great success.","First, there was the Kodak DC-20...YUK! Then the Polaroid PDC-640...you get what you pay for. Now I have a Cybershot and am finally happy!<br />I purchased this camera mainly because I couldn't get decent resolution in photos I use for computer wallpaper. This camera exceeded my wildest expectations.<br />The download times, with the USB cable, are like Warp 9 vs. 1/4 impulse power from the Polaroid's serial interface. Battery life, WITH the LCD screen beats the pants off the Polaroid, I used to only shop for cameras that took alkaline batteries (I won't even talk about the Kodak, a BAD experience). The ability to add verbal notations with your pictures has been invaluable in my job. I think the only way to get (noticeably) better photo resolution is to spend another $1000 or more.<br />The downsides are, of course, the 4 meg memory stick...lack of a carrying case...delay of shutter release. I won't call the lack of an optical viewfinder bad...the view through the one on my Polaroid never looked like the finished picture.<br />All in all, with the addition of (at least) a 32 meg memory stick AND a decent carrying case, I have an excellent camera for many enjoyable years of photo opportunities.","I think this camera is really great. It takes excellant photos, the resolution is plenty for most any photos, and I like the display that flips up and turns 180 degrees so you can take your own photos (the new Cybershot models don't do this). The MPEGs with sound are really cool and everyone I have shown this too has been amazed that it takes videos with sound. The display is sometimes difficult to see in bright light, and it does not have a viewfinder, but I seem to adapt to this limitation without any problems. I like it more than most other brands of digital cameras and the memory sticks are priced right and hold a lot of photos. I bought the memory stick floppy disk adapter and it makes it easy to read the photos even though the USB interface is really simple to use also, if your computer has one. Just plan to have a CR-RW drive so you can save your photos and clear off the memory stick for taking more. It puts the time and date on your photos for recording when they were taken right on the print, which I have heard most other digital cameras don't do this. It is the perfect size, not too big, and it takes photos that make me look like a professional. I have taken beautiful sunsets that the exposure would not have been right if I had taken them with a 35mm camera. The menu system is great, and the camera has a large display (larger than the new Cybershot models) and a way to flip it around so it is protected from being scratched. I really like it and recommend buying it over the new equivalent model.","This is the first digital camera I have owned so I can't compare it to others, but this one does most of what I want to do and more than I actually use. I bought it because I, in a strained sense of scurry, drove 200 miles to see my first grandchild and left my 35mm camera at home. I had seen reviews before purchasing but weighed all the options before buying this one. The zoom is great for a small camera but not like a 28-210 Kiron. The ease of use is fabulous for a point and click buff but includes helpful adjustments for lighting, various resolutions, and more. Short video clips of the new \"Princess\" are priceless. Relatives enjoy viewing the \"day's catch\" with the slide show feature. Takes fantastic pictures that I print using my home computer or upload for professional printing. A few flaws I've seen mentioned (...) on which I concur: 4mb memory stick takes 4 pics at 1600x1200, not very useful. I bought 2 64mb sticks (aboout 80 pictures each). I tend to keep almost all of the pictures I take until I've had time to review closer so I won't delete pictures I wish I had back. LCD screen is very hard to see in bright sunlight and since I like the sun to my back and not to the subject's back, well, you get the picture (pun intended). You cannot see subject on LCD at night without lighting assistance. Works best inside, but takes great outdoor pictures if you can frame what you're tryng to photograph. I'm sure more expensive cameras will do more (and they're all over-priced), but for the comparative price range, this one is great.","Believe it or not, I have taken over 6,000 photos with my Sony DSC-S50 over the past year.  I absolutely love this camera.<br />I researched all cameras well, and for the price, I found this one to be the best buy.  The lithium battery adds alot to the camera.","I purchased this camera after looking at a lot of different cameras. I was really impressed by the image quality, and the lithium-ion battery. The main complaint consumers have about digital cameras is battery consumption (I work as a tech-support agent for a digital camera manufacturer and field calls from customers on battery issues daily). The battery, the image quality, and the SONY name sold me on this excellent camera. The small memory stick that was included was a downside, but overall I am very happy. Getting the photos to the PC is very straight forward with no extra software to complicate things - you save images directly off the memory stick as if it were a floppy disk or CD-ROM disk through windows explorer. Easy as pie.","Have seen a lot of digicams, but this one (or DSC30 or DSC70 for that matter) beats all of them with it's user-friendly controls and computer interface. Really, as someone has already said here -- I never had to take out the manual....","I have this product and i don't use it ... it just sits beside my computer ... i'm not even really sure why my parents got it for me ... but if someone wants to buy it from me ... email me at c-young1@northwestern.edu","After looking at camera reviews for over 2 months I finally settled on this one.  This is my first camera and I must say that I'm really happy with my choice.  It seems it's hard to find a camera with all the features you want but this one had the most features.  What was important to me was a rechargeble lithium battery with good life and Sony is the only one I know of with the info lithium technology, included AC charger, MPEG movie capable, optical zoom, ease of use, customizable functions, USB connectivity, and of course picture quality.  With other cameras it seemed like you had to buy rechargeable batteries, a charger or they don't have USB support which is a must these days.  My only complaint is that it only comes with a 4mb memory stick which is not very useful but I bought a 16mb stick with it that turns out to be free with a $50 mail in rebate.  This is a great camera and I highly recommend it.","An absolutely fabulous camera.  Better than any that I have seen thus far on the market.  Of course, you do pay a hefty price for such quality (and by this I simply mean price in dollars).  In this particular model, you get up to 2.1 megapixel resolution, which allows for still shots up to 1600 x 1200 (keep in mind, that most people view web pages at 800 x 600, so this is quite large).  The unit ships with a dismal 4 MB of memory, which can only store appx. 4 pictures of the highest resolution.  I would recommend an upgrade to 8 or 16 MB of memory, via Memory Sticks.  Other than that, the product is great, includes USB connectivity for speedy transfers of images, and even allows for full motion video (assuming the memory is available).  As a side note, please use extra caution when touching the screen.  The unit has a special Liquid Crystal display, which does a great job at displaying the images, but is easily susceptable to dust and fingerprints.  Be careful when cleaning the screen, as using a rough substance can really cause problems.","We just started using a Sony CyberShot DSC S50, purchased from Amazon.com.<br />The price and service from Amazon.com were pretty good, but there's still a lot to buy. Most purchasers of 35 mm point and shoot cameras expect to get a soft case when they buy their camera. Not so with the Sony. The 4MB Memory Stick that comes with the camera is essentially useless, unless the only planned use for the camera is to record low resolution images. Of course, if this were the case, there would be no rationale for buying a 2.1 megapixel camera. Expect to tack at least $100 to the price to buy the \"necessary extras.\"<br />The camera is great fun. It's compact and easy to hold and use. The lithium ion battery charges quickly (full charge in about 2 hours) and provides sufficient power for two days or more of heavy use. The user interface is fairly intuitive and the controls are easy to use. There are several useful features (e.g. adjustable flash intensity). It's easy to get started right away, and it seems to take good pictures under a wide range of lighting conditions.<br />The LCD viewing screen is wonderful. It is clear and bright. The lack of an optical viewfinder, though, is a problem. The LCD is tough to see in bright sunlight (though screen brightness is adjustable). Also, you can't see your subject if you are shooting at night.<br />We've just started experimenting with the image processing software provided for the PC. It's not the easiest nor most intuitive application we have encountered and there is no accompanying  written documentation.<br />Overall, we're happy with the purchase and (based on past volume of use of our point and shoot 35 mm camera) expect to take a lot of digital snapshots.","I have had this camera for about six months now.  As a serious ammateur photographer for 15 years, I swore that I would still use my film camera for some things, but I haven't touched it.  I take this Sony everywhere.  This camera is a great all-around digital camera.  It is compact, easy to use, the menus and controls are easily understood, and it takes great pictures.  I was thinking about getting the S30 without the video feature instead, but I am very glad I got the video.  I really like the video feature and I use it a lot.  Below are a few major points you should consider about this camera.<br /> First of all, no other digital camera brand I have seen comes anywhere close to the lens quality of the Sonys.  The marco (close-up) setting allows you to take a picture from literally a half inch away from the subject.  Most other digital cameras with macro settings let you get as close as a couple feet.  This means that when you can get, at closest, a full-frame picture of your whole hand with other digicams, the sony lets you zoom all the way in to just a fingernail.  Incidentally this camera also has a text-capture mode which I have used quite successfully for taking pictures of blueprints and other documents.  These kinds of images show up nicely on the computer screen.<br /> Secondly, This camera is fully mac-compatible.  It comes with a USB cable and software that actually does work on the Mac.  When you connect the camera to the cable, it shows up on the desktop just like a drive.  The only problem I have had is when reading files right off the disc - sometimes it thinks there's a problem with the drive.  If you first transfer them to your hard drive and then view them there's no problem.<br /> Some rules of thumb for file size:  A high resolution pic (1600x1200) typically takes about 900k, so I figure about one meg each.  The medium res (1024x768) is about 300k per pic, so I figure about three pics per meg.  These are still pretty high resolution pictures.  The lowest res (640x480) pics take about 100k each (a nice size for emailing).  That's about 10 per meg.  On video mode, the high res (320x240) takes about 100k per second, so about 10 sec of video per meg.  The low res video mode (160x112) does about 40 sec per meg.  So with the 4 mb memory stick that comes with the camera you can get about 4 or 5 high res pics, 15 med res pics, 40 low res pics, 40 sec high res video, or 160 sec low res video.  So in summary, get more memory.  I bought two 64 mb cards and they lasted a whole 4-day vacation, and I am pretty snap-happy.<br /> The one problem that I have to complain about is that there is about a one-second delay between pushing the shutter button and the actual capture of the image.  (And I am not talking about the  wait time for writing the file, I am talking about the actual moment of the photograph)  This means that if you are taking pictures of subjects in motion you will have to anticipate the moment and push the button a second early.  If you take a lot of action shots, this camera will proove frustrating.  Often a critical moment will have passed by the time the camera actually takes the picture.  Baby pics, wedding dance pictures, sports shots, all of these are very hard to do with this camera.  For regular static subjects this is not a problem, but for objects in motion this camera is difficult.<br />All in all I highly reccommend this camera.  Happy shopping.","As mentioned in previous reviews, if you want higher resolution pictures, the 4 MB or 8 MB memory sticks are not adequate.  I could only get 4 pictures on the 4 MB memory stick.  You are now able to purchase a 64 MB memory stick, which will be much better for long trips and using the movie function.<br />The pictures look great on-line, but you have to have a good printer to go along with the camera if you expect to print pictures.<br />The information available at the Amazon.com site regarding how to select a camera is very helpful and explains a great deal of information that the will not be readily available at your local computer store selling digital camers.","This is my first digital camera. I origionally intended to purchase the Mavica 90 however when I found the Cybershot, I fell in love with the SIZE and the 2.1 megapixel. The battery life on this camera is fantastic, 2 1/2 hours. The batteries and memory sticks interchange with most of Sony's newer model video cameras. The flash works great in TOTAL darkness up to about 5 feet, after that, it's not much good. In low light, the flash works great. One fantastic feature is the screen, it is clear, sharp and when not in use, turns inward so it is protected from getting scratched ect., a definate PLUS! The screen is some what dark when shooting in low light but you can take your shot and look at it right away in \"play\" mode to see how the shot came out. For me, a minor inconvenience when shooting in LOW LIGHT. The controls are easy to figure out and after playing with them for about 15 minuites, I was ready to go. The video mode will record up to 60 seconds and the sound is really good, given the size of this little baby. Now for the few MINOR drawbacks. First, the 4 meg memory stick supplied with the camera is a joke. Plan on getting at least an 8 meg but I would suggest no less than a 32 meg. Second drawback is the Memory stick/Floppy Disk adaptor. When I purchased it, I was told it worked just like the Mavica - it DOES NOT. Without the software, the adaptor does not work, so if you plan on popping it into a friends computer to look at your pics (Like the Mavica), forget it, unless you carry the software disk around with you. All in all though, this is a great little camera. Smaller, higher pixels and cheaper in price than the Mavica. It performs as advertised by Sony and I was not disappointed. One suggestion, look at the sony starter kit, it includes a carry case, 8 meg memory stick and extra battery, well worth the money in my opinion. If you do get it, I would place a piece of foam in the bottom of the carry case to better padd the camera. Bottom line, if you have been looking at the Mavica's, look at the Cybershot 50 before you make your purchase. If you can do without throwing the floppy disk format into anyone's computer then the cybershot is better, smaller and lighter. For me, it was a minor trade off. EVERY person I have showed this camera to now wants one !","I bought this camera for my internet children's clothing business.  I was originally using an FD-73, but needed better resolution that this camera supplied.  With the Cybershot, you can choose you desired resolution.  After careful consideration of the FD-85 for its convenient floppy drive, I chose the cybershot.  A decision that I have not regretted.  The rotating lcd screen is a great idea and safeguard against breakage.  We actually cracked the screen on the previously mentioned camera while it was in its camera case in a suitcase during a vacation.  I have been very pleased with this lightweight camera's performance, user friendliness, and versatility.  However, my shopping list now includes a 64MB memory stick.  The 4MB stick included with the camera holds only 4 pictures in the highest resolution.","The good news is this camera is packed with alot of great features and is extremely simple to use.  The LCD screen is the best I've had the privledge of viewing.  Also, the screen twisting capability makes it really easy to compose regardless of subject position.  The on screen display and joystick control make it a snap to navigate between options.  The picture taking is fast compared to other cameras I've used that have a 2-3 second delay.  Also, power on and zoom is fast.  The battery life is fantastic for a digital camera.  At this point, the perfect camera for me...<br />Unfortunately, the bad makes this camera completely useless for me.  The pictures are awful, even though others have written good reviews.  At first I thought it might be user error, so I went through all the manuals, tried a bunch of different settings, took flash and ambient light pictures... all had the same result...  dark pictures and lacking definition.  So, then I thought it was the camera so I exchanged and got a second one -- same thing.  I'm returning this camera tomorrow for good.<br />The Kodak DC290 has a relatively short battery life, a mediocre display and is slow, but takes amazingly beautiful pictures with perfect color rendition.  I'm staying with it...  If Sony could get better picture quality it would be the perfect camera for my needs.","Quick facts about this camera: It's light, battery life lasts roughly 3 hours of straight use, and the 4MB Memory Stick supplied is decent. The user interface is so simple I NEVER had to get the instructions. There are so many personal tweaks you can adjust to the camera (white balance, black and white mode, timed exposures, 10 second timer, great zoom lens, macro mode... the list goes on!). The movable LCD screen is crisp and is very convenient to use. The camera feels solid and well-built.<br /><br />I personally bought a 32MB Memory Stick to gain more picture storage- this camera can now take 80-90 pictures at 1024x768 resolution. Also bought the Floppy Disk Adapter... but stick with the USB if you already have it on your computer.<br /> Also, one side note- this camera will be able to link to your Sony Playstation2 video game console in the future!","The DSC-S50 is my second digital camera and I have been very satisfied with it.  It is very easy to use and has the power user features that you expect for a camera of it's class.  I use it for capturing pictures for the web and it's 2.1 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for that purpose. It comes with only 4 megs of storage, but is easy to upgrade.  Lexar noew makes memory sticks and the price is close to the compact flash prices.  I picked up a 32 mb stick and I can take about 80 pictures at the medium resolution of 1024x768.  The big drawback is the lack of an optical viewfinder.  The LCD display is very nice, but drains the battery.  It's also very difficult to see in bright daylight.","The Sony DSC-S50 may not be the cheapest digital camera you can buy, but it certainly has to be one of the best. The USB port makes loading your pictures on a computer really easy. The controls and menu layout are similar to the Mavica, so if you have used that camera then you already know how the menu system on this one works. The small size and storage capacity are what sold me on this camera. As noted in some other reviews, a viewfinder would be nice, because if you are taking pictures outside, it can be difficult at times to see the image on the flip-up screen. But those are about the only drawbacks to this camera I can think of. I have taken most of my pictures at the lowest resolution, and even then, they are still EXCELLENT pictures. I even posted a picture of a book cover on ebay, and you could read every word that was printed on the book cover. I used the Macro mode and it worked great. I have used a Kodak and Mavica (not owned) in the past, and found the Kodak to be OK, but it isn't in the same league with SONY. I also have to give AMAZON a plug here too. They gave me great service, shipping costs were reasonable, and you save at least $50 or so compared to a typical retailer. This camera comes with a 4mb Memory Stick and I bought a 16mb for additional storage capacity, and I would definitely recommend getting at least that. They are a little pricey right now, but I'm betting the price will drop in the future. Overall, this is a great camera and you won't be disappointed if you buy it. Don't waste your money on off-brands.","I purchased the S50 as a replacement to my traditional 35mm point and  shoot camera.  For the most part it does a good job.  As others have  mentioned, the LCD is quite difficult (if not impossible) to see in bright  sunlight or dark situations.  The red eye reduction does an adequate job,  but I still get a lot of red eye.  The most annoying thing for me is the  shutter delay.  Even without the flash, the delay is quite disconcerting.  The time the shutter needs to be held to take a photo takes some  adjustment.  If you plan to take action shots or shots of children (who  tend to move constantly) getting the shot you want is nearly impossible.  If you use the flash in red eye reduction mode, the delay is quite long.  Since the camera is digital, it's not as disturbing when I  \"waste\" a shot, but I do get frustrated missing a shot I want  because the of the shutter delay.  However, as with an electronic device  there's a learning curve.  Once you get used to the specifics of the S50,  it's a good camera.<br />The 4MB memory stick is surprisingly adequate, but  I still recommend an additional 16MB or 32MB stick.  The menu structure is  intuitive, as are the controls.  The layout of the controls on the camera  are well placed, too.<br />The interface to Windows 98 is seemless.  The  included software has its limitations.  Rotating images yields a  disapointing loss in quality.  It's adequate for simple webpage use, but  for any serious editting there are far better packages.<br />The S50 is a  good replacement for my old point and shoot, but I still use my traditional  35mm for action shots.","While there are many cameras to choose from, the Sony camera offers the most features for the money. Its a great 2 mega pixel camera, that has a VERY nice LCD screen (one of the best I've seen). The MPEG feature will not  be useful to most, being that it is very low quality, but it's nice to  have. Make sure you have a good printer to go with the camera (this is the  case for any digital camera)!<br />The camera comes with everything you need,  cables, battery, software, and 4MB memory stick which suprisingly can hold  a pretty good amount of pictures. I would get the extra 16MB memory stick  as well... With the 4MB and  16MB memory sticks, you'll be set for any vacation.<br />Because it is USB,  all you have to do is copy two sony extensions into your system folder and  the camera is ready to work on your MACINTOSH. Just plug it in and you can  read/delete from the sony memory stick as if it was a mounted drive.","Since my purchase of the Sony DCR-TRV10 camcorder earlier this year, I  found that the 640x480 resoution wasn't enough for all of my digital  imaging needs.  The CyberShot DCS-S50 not only takes excellent pictures on  it own, but is an excellent companion to this digital camcorder.  The  memory sticks are interchangeable between the Camcorder and the CyberShot.  Since the DSC-S50 has higher resolution capability I can take my still  images stored on the Memory Stick from the camcorder and increase their  resolution with the CyberShot without having to first download them to my  PC.  (keep in mind that your Sony Memory Stick must have enough space to  add these higher resolution images, also remember, high res. means higher  memory consumption) These two products also share the same rechargeable  battery pack, lens size (.37mm), memory sticks and recharger.  Since my  earlier camcorder purchase, I have aquired more Memory Sticks and after  market zoom and wide angle lens.  All of these devices are  interchangeable.<br />The main reason that I didn't go ahead and purchase the  DCS-S70 (3.3 Megapixel) was the incompatibilty between lens and sizes.  This DCS-S50 (2.1 Megapixel) made a lot more sense once you weighed in the  interchangeability factor.<br />I am pleased that this manufacturer decided to  maintain this compatability an allow me to enhance my digital photography  collection.<br />I also agree with some others and wish it had a supplemental  fixed view finder like the DSC-S70, for bright sun and very low light  occasions.  But all in all, I believe it is an excellent digital camera  value.","I bought one of these about 6 weeks ago as I write this, and have fired a couple hundred pictures, and a couple of short videos through it.  Wonderful! It takes great pictures, and the videos (with built-in  microphone) are pretty cool, too. While the controls seemed a little  unwieldy at first, once I pulled out the manual, I needed less than an hour  to go through the options and see how everything works, which isn't too bad  of a learning curve at all. The LCD viewer is great - I can edit and delete  images while shooting, thus saving some precious memory stick space.  I  have appreciated that the LCD viewscreen can also be swiveled around  laterally and vertically, even to point forward, so I can take a picture of  myself and, at the same time, see myself in the viewfinder.  Brilliant! The  flash does a great job of illuminating scenes.  The camera also offers  ability to adjust for white based on indoor, outdoor, or \"other\"  conditions (sounds dumb, I know, to have \"other\", but trust me,  it makes sense).  This is my first USB peripheral, and I have to say I am  impressed - I can pull down a full 32MB memory stick pretty darn quick, and  it's really nice being able to plug the USB port in *while the computer is  on*, and immediately use it without any software hassles. I have to admit  to a certain awe at Microsoft for actually pulling it off with win98.  You  can use the software that comes with the camera, but I have not, since you  will find better image handling, organizing, and altering software as  freeware, shareware, or expensive (like photoshop) professional  stuff.<br />Another super aspect of this camera is the battery - it is  removable, but it is rechargable, and the camera comes with a DC-in jack  and it's own external power supply, so you can plug the camera into the  wall, and recharge that battery for another 2.0-2.5 hours of use.  No more  buying scads and scads of Earth-killing AAs. This is such a simple built-in  to add, and such a highly useful extra, I really have to question why every  digitial camera doesn't do this.<br />On the downside, the viewfinder is very,  very difficult to see when outside; sometimes impossible to see.  And, of  course, please realize that this camera is a point-and-shoot (albeit a  functional one), so changing lenses is *not* an option, nor is having much  control over f-stop or shutter speed - you will have some control, but the  f-stop and shutter speed ranges are not are not what you might be used to.  I also think that, overall, its senstivity to white is not as good as it  should be - my whites tend to end up a bit grey; not much, but a bit.  But  I have to admit I dont know if that's the camera, or a problem with the  really hazy NYC days we've had and/or from shooting inside in rooms with a  mix of flourescent and incandescent lighting.<br />Overall, I am impressed  with this camera, I'm very glad I bought it (and not a different one), and  while it is not 3 megapixels, unless you plan to make large prints of your  images, the resolution on this camera is far higher than you need for  web-image making, and high enough for anything else. It's small, easy to  carry, easy to use, easy to download, and easy to recharge. For the money,  this is, in my opinion, your best deal for a non-professional 2 megapixel  digital camera.","I bought one of these cameras and find it to be all that the others have said. However, I find that in the bright sunlight you have trouble seeing  the image in the LCD display. It would be of benefit to have a viewfinder,  wish it did.","I've been looking at Digital Camera's for about a year now. The Sony has always won my heart because of their Great reputation and Excellent Quality!  I was shooting for the DSC-F505 which has a lot of the same  qualities as this model.  I decided to go for the middle of the road in  price and chose the DSC-S50.  I  am thoroughly satisfied with what I have  acquired!  The picture quality is OUTSTANDING!  I was used to receiving  pictures that were 1.3mega pixels.. well this blows them away!  This camera  makes details crisper and cleaner than anything I've seen before.. it's an  Excellent camera and a must-have for sharing your life through e-mail!  Enjoy!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I dont know who wrote this!  I've never owned this product so never wrote this review!","the sony dscs50 cybershot digital camera is a much improved design on the mavica series, while giving high resolution and delivering a compact stylish case.  the resoulution is good for web pages, home photos transfer,  and comes with good editing resources.  The other advantage is the easy  storage on the memory stick and of course the adaptors make it easy to  insert as a floppy into your pc.  to summarise the advantages are:<br />1.  good resolution 2. easy to carry 3. easy storage 4. no complicated software  5. easy to transfer onto the pc<br />The disadvantages are:<br />1. The  resolution is not as good as the 3+ mega pixel cameras available today.  2. THe price is not competitive enough<br />i would reccomend this camera to  anyone who's starting out with digital cameras and wants a easy to  use,stylish, camera which yields above average resoultion pics by digital  camera standards.

Awesome job Sony!","I know this camera is now out of date with only 3.3 mp, however I just wanted to say that this camera is going on 6 years of use and has never failed me!!! what I love most is where the controls for the AE programing are, smart and fast.

We ran out of memory sticks pretty quickly and found the price for the 64 mb stick to be pretty expensive. Overall the image quality (on 2048 3:2 mode) is excellent. The colors are vibrant and we are able to easily print A4 copies on high quality printers.","The longer I own this DSC-S70 digital camera, the more I like it. As I climb up on the learning curve of all the camera's functioanlities, I think that it is a very fine piece of precision instrument and worth every penny of its price.<br />Some users, I believe, have overlooked the advanced functions of the camera. The shutter speed, for example, can be adjusted in 13 steps from 1/8 sec. to 1/1000 of a second in taking pictures of a moving subject. And the aperture can be adjusted in 9 steps from F2.0 to F8.0.<br />Another great feature is the selection of alternative image sizes. I used to use the 1290 x 960 size which would allow 96 images with a 64 mb memory stick. Then I found the quality of the picture was sufficiently good even if I went down to 640 x 480 size which would allow 760 images with the same 64 mb memory stick. During my recent vacation in France, I recorded several hundred images on one single memory stick. (But don't forget to bring your international electical adapter since you have to recharge the battery every night.)<br />Lastly, the German Zeiss lens is definitely superior to other cameras' lenes on the market.<br />I think that the camera has a good chance of becoming a collector's item since Sony has already stopped production of this model.","The pictures from this camera are beautiful.  We have taken over 3000.  However, buyer should beware of the sensitivity of the lens.  Once, I set it down quickly and must have barely tapped the lens.  The lens stopped going in and out.  The camera was 4 months old, but Sony told me the labor warrantee was only for 3 months.  They said we would have to pay a flat rate...for labor of the repair.  So I bought a camera... 4 months ago, and they insist I pay [money] for some little problem. Hmmm.<br />Well, we tapped the lens, figuring we had nothing to lose, and it started moving again.  It has worked without a problem since then.  However, I am very careful of the delicate nature of the camera and do not feel free to take it just anywhere.<br />Once again, the pictures are worth every penny.  It just isn't a camera you can casually throw around your neck or in your bag.","I bought this camera and did not notice that I did not have a battery charger for it. I am looking to find one. Maybe you can help me.","Bought this camera over 3 months ago, have no complaints.  Takes incredible pictures - no matter what quality pictures you want to take(high or low resolution).  The digital movie is a joke and hardly ever used.  You should consider buying extra memory sticks.  The camera USB interface is a breeze to connect to your PC.  Your computer will treat the camera as a computer and see the memory stick as a Harddrive.  The camera also have S-video interface to connect to the TV or VCR to entertain your family/friends during the holiday.","I purchased the DSC70 several months ago. I bought it for the pixel resolution and it was an update from a Sony Mavica 85. I love the quality of the pictures and the features that it has. The only draw back is the slow shutter reponse. It is a real problem trying to take pictures of my two year old grandaughter (one of the reasons for the purchase). She is a lot faster than the shutter response is. I have deleted many pictures of the back of her head. It is a great camera and I love it. I just wish that it was faster. NOTE: I did notice the compliants of slow shutter response in the reviews that I read, now I know what they mean.","This is an excellent camera.  With 3.3 megapixels, mpeg mode, and the small memory stick that can store a lot of pictures makes this a great camera-- plus Sony's quality can't be beat.  I also bought the Sony picture printer which prints pictures that look like I had them developed.  I highly recommend this camera.","I bought this camera as a treat for myself at Christmas, and I must say I am 100% satisfied with all of its functions.  It is wonderful to be able to take pictures of my grandson  at any given moment, no worry about films, I am always ready and the quality is just perfect.  I highly recommend this camera for its size and quality.  I do suggest buying the floppy adaptor and the additional 64 megabyte memory stick.","I bought this camera in December 2000, and it has continued to impress me.  One of the deciding factors in my choice to buy this camera over others was the menu.  I was able to understand the options and figure out the camera without reading the manual.  For some other cameras I looked at, I couldn't figure out how to change the picture size or file format.  The other features that I was looking for were the USB cable, a decent optical zoom, macro mode, and at least 3 megapixels.<br />Things I like about this camera:<br />Picture quality -  I am only an amateur photographer, but the color, contrast, brightness, and sharpness all seem great to me.<br />Ease of menu use - as decribed above<br />Macro mode - Lets me take great close-up pictures of flowers, butterflies, and other random things.<br />Memory Stick - Granted I bought the 64MB Memory Stick extra, but it holds a lot.  I generally take about 1/4 of my pictures in JPEG mode at 2048x1536 and 3/4 at 1600x1200 (which is still way bigger than my monitor); using this scheme I have been able to take more than 60 pictures at one time with room left over for more.<br />USB cable - I can download a full Memory Stick of pictures (64MB) onto my hard drive in under 3 minutes.<br />Battery - It comes with a rechargable battery so you don't have to buy one.<br />Things I don't like:<br />Focus time - It takes about one second to find the focus before it takes a picture, which can make it hard to time action shots.<br />Software - I don't use the image editing software that came with the camera because I already had something better.","Excellent Camera. Win 2000 driver is available for download from their site (hard to find, but it is there!)","Hi, I am from Quebec Canada.  I got the Sony S70 in Oct, 2000, I think it is the best thing since sliced bread. Great all around. But I do have a few concerns, I am having a hard time reading or even seeing the LCD when outdoors on a bright day. That is the only bad thing I can say about it, yes it is expensive, I agree there should have been at least  a 64meg stick. but I purchased the 64 and with the memory stick adaptor I have no problems with memory, while visiting in Toronto, Canada I took over 8 disks (flopies) it only takes a minute to load the program on to any computer, then you just put them on to disks and then sort them later. As far as a case goes I brought an execllent case from Sony dealer it is a CD player case and works great you can carry all you need with this camera. I would like to lay my hands on another battery. But as far as quality goes I think it is tops. ... Thanks","I started out with this camera but quickly switched to the DSC-P1 when that model arrived.<br />The DSC-P1 has nearly identical performance, but improves very nicely on the DSC-S70. First, the P1 is a lot smaller. The compact size really helps to make it easier to use. Second, the P1 has a built in lens cover that opens or closes as you turn the camera on or off. And the P1 is the same price as the S70.<br />I would recommend that anyone looking at the S70 consider the P1 instead.","I bought my DSC-S70 because my family and I were about to go on vacation to London and I felt that the image quality from digital cameras had finally surpassed film-based cameras.  I absolutely love my DSC-S70 and recommend it to anyone that is interested in getting a digital camera.  I have not had any troubles with my DSC-S70.  The only real problem I had was finding 64 MB Memory Sticks since none of the local stores had gotten them in yet.  I had to settle for 2 32 MB ones.  But since each one is equivalent to a roll of 35 mm film when you use the highest JPEG setting, it wasn't really a problem.  I only took one bad picture during the entire vacation, and that was because my brother bumped in to me when I pressed the shutter and I didn't notice it until later.  Although I felt that the 8 MB Memory Stick was a little small, I'd rather pay for the little bit of memory that I actually need than pay for the memory that I will never use.  I may have needed 64 MB for my trip to London, but in most cases, I'll never need to take more than 8 MB with me.  Sony also gives you a ... gift certificate for its online store if you register your camera online.  If you use this gift certificate towards another 8 MB stick, it will only cost you ..., giving you the same amount of memory that all the other cameras give.  And now, I think they give you ... back if you buy a memory stick with the camera.  I found the MPEG performance to be quite pleasing, especially in the HQ mode.  It had no problems adjusting from a close-up to a wide shot and was able to catch details like the pixels on an LCD screen.  All of my shots came out crystal clear.  I took my shots of Piccadilly Circus and turned them into a 360 degree panorama that looked as good as any of the professional ones on the Internet.  Even on the brightest days, the camera produced excellent results.  I would have been comfortable with the camera and its menu system even if I hadn't read the manual.  The icons in the Program AE mode are confusing UNTIL you read the manual.  Remember that this isn't a cheap film camera with just one button; you actually have options about what your picture will look like.  I tried the Olympus 3030 in the store and was absolutely confused with its icons, but not with the Sony DSC-S70.  I am very pleased with this camera and would buy it again if I had the chance.","I am looking to buy a compatible video and still camera and think that the sony pc-5 and the DSC-70 would be compatible. The pc-5 is stripped down to the basics for a consumer camera and is small enough to carry in a pocket without looking bulky. If I'm buying a good digital still camera, I don't need the pc-100 which is the same video camera with a slightly better still function. My question is, can I take the memory stick out of my 3.+ megapixal still camera and put it in my pc-5 digital camera, download the pictures onto the digital tape and maintain their high 3.+ resolution, thereby circumventing the need for multiple memory sticks on an extended trip, for example? I have not seen this question addressed anywhere and would like to find out.","Sharp, Clear Detail. That says it all. Sony has a new dsc 75 out now. Its just a bit faster in the re-load time between pics.  But a bit more $.  I love mine. Verry eays to learn & use.","My wife wanted ease of use and I wanted optical resolution and zoom. The DSC-S70 met both our requirements. We've had the camera for about four months and are still very satisfied.<br />Some good things about the camera: The pictures are great. Printed on an Epson 2500 they look photo quality. The Info lithium battery goes forever and is quick to recharge. The LCD display controls are easy to learn. Lot's of flexibility in recording and exposure modes if you care to operate other than automatic. The video playback, both pictures and video clips, is straight forward and works well.<br />Some things to think about: The included 8MB memory stick is too small. I ended up buying two 64MB sticks, and at about $120 each I think they're too spendy, but then so is SmartMedia and Flash. If you have any other Sony products that use memory sticks it takes some of the sting out of buying extra memory. The delay when the camera 'sets up the exposure' (shutter button part way down) takes some getting used to. Picture processing time at the highest resolution is about half a second so there's no 'rapid fire' picture taking.<br />If you're a Windows 2000 user you'll have to get the USB drivers from Sony's website. It took a Sony technician almost one-hour to find them for me. Once installed the camera worked fine with Windows 2000.","This Camera is the best digital out there. Team it with a epson sp870 printer , and you will have photo's printed that will be impossible to distinguish from standard film. My recommendation is not to down on a product because of your computers out of date OS. Sony has had a 98 updated driver out since weeks after the camera came out and ME loves it. Only flaw is expensive memory stick media, and it dosen't come with an Aibo.","I found the camera easy to use out of the box and the quality of the pictures to be very good, 8 X 10\" come out great in high resolution modes. I was especially impressed with how good it shoots in low light situations. The rechargeable battery is very good, but buy an extra. The same goes for the memory stick, you really need to invest in the larger capacity memory sticks, I found a need for 3 when on vacation.<br />Problems: The LCD is hard to read in bright sunlight (common to all) but you still have an eye viewer - that's good. Next there is a delay time between pressing the shutter and the actual taking of the picture (you get used to this) and secondly the recycle time between pictures is a few seconds, so rapid fire shooting is not possible.<br />I have also switched this camera to \"black and white\" mode for outdoor scenery shots and it works very well. With easily obtainable software, like Adobe Photo Shop, you can change the contrast and brightness easily for more striking effects. When taking normal color photos you can also enhance contrast and colors to enhance or exaggerate for some great \"artistic\" effects. I then use a well known HP printer for $200 or less and get great photo prints when using their high quality glossy or matte photo paper.","I have held off buying a digital camera with all the talk about batteries, but after using a Sony camcorder with a Info Lithium battery decided to try the Dsc and have been impressed so far. It does not equal a regular 35mm but for instant snaps to email relatives and shots of work projects it sure saves a lot of time over having things developed and scanned. As far as getting accesories I found it uses the same lenses as the camcorder and have had no problem getting items from Sony online.","This is my 1st digital camera. Even though I have a very good 35MM camera I was very surprised at the clarity of the pictures this camera took. It is very easy to use, the user interface is easy to learn and it has enough extras to let you compose unique pictures. The only problem I had was getting it away from my wife once she learned how to use it. Also Sony was very cheap in only shipping a 8MB memory stick which is a joke. However if you want a camera that takes excellant pictures, is very easy to use and makes digital photography fun this is the camera for you.","I had this camera for over a week.  I took pictures daily and rounded up about 300 pictures all around Norwalk, CT.  Did inside shots of nuseums, malls.  Did outside shots of gardens, parks, fall colours in sunshine and fog.  All great shots.  Macro parallelx problems on closeups in Macro mode was awful.  The center of the view finder cross-hairs puts the center at the top of the LCD screen<br />Took it to the harbour to grab some shots of speed boats, cars.  WRONG!  The shots between writes was for-ever (it seems).  Missed some shots of kids water skiing (COLD kids).  My DSC-F55 grabed some shots thatyou cannot tell between the DSC-S70 and the F55.<br />I'll wait until they improve on the performance by adding a bigger buffer.","The picture quality and versatility of this camera is outstanding.  I was able to begin using all of the camera features immediately without having to read the manual.  What made it less than perfect?  The auto-focus and processing delay when shooting in high resolution is slow enough to make moving/action shots almost impossible to time properly. (2-3 seconds) I also experienced some problems interfacing the USB port to some Windows 95 R2 (with USB updates)based PCs.  I found it to work perfectly with Windows 98.  Best Features: The camcorder battery (lasts almost forever)and the availability of a 64MB stick (especially important for high resolution shooting).","This camera rules. The Carl Zeiss lens (the best optical lens ever) makes colors in pictures clear and vibrant. 3.3 megapixel quality is higher than that of a regular chemical photo which is approximately 2.8 megapixels. It has plenty of options, yet it's easy to use. The only other cameras I would consider is ... which is less than $... (2 megapixels) and the current best seller, Nikon Coolpix 990 which is more expensive, has a terrible red-eye problem and more features that you can ever use. And now, if you could only find a printer that could match the whole potential of this camera...","The S70's focusing system is slow and can be inaccurate when the intended subject is off-center. Some shadow areas or low light photos cause chromatic aberrations. The worst camera problem however is the over-saturation of primary colors especially red. What at first may appear, as a vibrant color upon closer inspection really is an unnatural boost of certain colors in the camera's processing algorithm.  This occurs to the point of eliminating detail and subtleties.<br />But my biggest complaint is not the camera but Sony. I have had the s70 since July 00' and attempted to find the one basic item/accessory that any camera owner with common sense would want - a filter for lens protection.  The camera requires an adapter to attach ANY filter or lens. Not only could I not find this basic accessory anywhere on the net but also Sony has yet to fill my 2 Month+ order. To add to the frustration the filters were available immediately and have sat collecting dust for two months. The point here is 1) Manufacturers need to stop releasing products without simultaneously making available the basic items that are necessary to make the products useful - a 3 month wait is too long. 2) It seems that for some reason with digital cameras both retail and e-com stores while selling a wide variety of camera brands carry very few supplies/accessories for these same products. 3) Basic items should be included in the kit.<br />It seems to me that the best time to get a customer to buy the basic accessories is at the original time and place of purchase.","This camera takes some of the best shots I have ever been able to acheive in any camera.  The resolution for printing allows you to print very large photos with very good quality.  I can get better resolution than alot of 35mm I use to use.","This is my 3rd digital camera in 5 years ( AGFA e307 and Mavica 7 ) and by far the best of the lot. Every thing good/bad about this camera has already been said here so I would like to cover a couple other features not mentioned - some of these notes are mine, others from WWW sites and newsgroup posts.<br />The one second shutter delay can be somewhat shortened by half depressing the shutter button. The S-70 will the autofocus, which makes up most of the shutter lag. When you then press down the button all the way you'll find it will almost instantly take the picture. Several other techniques can be used to minimize the delay: 1) go to manual focus, 2) go to AE mode, 3) go to manual WB - the less auto, the faster the camera.<br />MPEG recording for 60 seconds. I would like to correct one reviewer regarding making videos with this camera - If you switch to the smaller resolution, and hold down the shutter button, you will get a minute of video. This is the max though. The camera has to store the raw video in internal memory, then convert it to mpeg and write it to the memory stick. The camera can only fit 15 seconds of large resolution video, and 60 seconds of small resolution video in the internal memory. There is no way to get more than this much video. OR.. reduce the size to 160 x 120 and  get 1 minute per segment.<br />EXIF information - data is automatically imbedded into the file when saved in the camera. The data includes the time and date the picture was taken, but also all information on the f-stop used, program mode chosen, shutter speed, flash utilisation and more. Much of this information can be seen by opening the image in MGI PhotoSuite (the version that came with your camera--or a later version) and selecting \"Image Information\" under the Image menu. If you choose to keep the information after downloading to your computer, you must ensure that the original is kept ( if you save the jpg file as something else, you lose the exif information). You can RENAME the file, but opening it and saving or modifying it in any way will lose the info.<br />I use Photoshop to edit and crop files, but always save as the PSD photoshop native format, which keeps the original jpg file untouched. I also chose the \"serial\" numbering option on the camera, which allows the memory stick contents to be moved to the PC in the same folder without having the \"file exists\" problem. (It carries on automatically with DSC00678.jpg etc, rather than going back to DSC0001.jpg every time a new stick is inserted or reused).","Like many of the other reviewers, I have read countless reviews about Digital Cameras before I made my choice.  While many reviews preferred the Nikon CoolPix 990 or Olympus 3030Z better, I chose this one for several reasons.  First off, the image quality is phenominal thanks to the Zeiss lens.  Secondly, this camera is around ($)cheaper than both of the others with comparable features.  Finally, you'll need to spend a lot less on accessories with this one as compared to the other two.  This camera comes with a built in battery charger and an AC-Adapter.  Those two things would run you about ($) with the other cameras.  Also, the memory sticks aren't as hard to find as everyone makes them out to be and they are in fact cheaper than SmartMedia or CompactFlash cards of equivalent sizes.  Throw that in with the fact that this camera bears the Sony name, and does a much better job of reducing the red-eye phenominon (which really really plagues the other two cameras I mentioned) during portraits, and you have the best value available in this price range, period.","I will be very honest I purchased this camera fully intending to return it. But after using it and the software included to retouch some wedding photos. I will keep the camera. It is easy to use and prints very well on my H/P 772. Using the H/P premium glossy paper produces very professional results. I am still trying to get the sizes coordinated for printing as the program is driving me and I feel I should be driving it. I am sure with practice it will come.  The camera is basically point-and-shoot, if you like the shot keep it if you don't delete and do it again. Everything is automatic and does a great job of compensating for conditions. Most of my photos have been indoors with a few outdoor shots which also turned out well.  NEGATIVES; 1.It has a hefty price tag.  2.Sony is stingy with the 8Mb memory stick, which is good for about 5 photos at 2048X1600 Pixies. I bought a 32 Mb stick and use the 8Mb stick for practice shots.  A 32 or a 64 should come along with the ... retail tag.  3.Also a protective carrying case would be nice. Afetr all this camera is not something to be tossed around lightly.","The Sony DSC-S70 Cyber-Shot is a great camera to own if picture quality is your main consideration.  Like all new electronic products, it takes awhile to learn all the ins and outs, but once you do, you'll be pleased with all the things this camera can do.  The quality of the photos is great.  With the USB connection, you can print directly from the camera if you want.  I was pleased with the light, contrast, level of detail, etc. when I printed.  The 8Mg memory stick doesn't hold much -- only 5 pictures at the 2048 x 1536 resolution.  That's the main drawback.  I bought the accessory[kit] which includes a carrying case, spare battery, and another 8Mg memory stick.  I like that they include the AC adapter with the camera.  I'm still learning and experimenting, since I've only had the camera a week.  The menus are easy to navigate.  Oh, by the way, it has a 6x digital zoom, not 2x.  That's so prominent on the packaging, I'm surprised the product specs and other reviewers misstated it.","For the price that you pay, you simply can't beat this camera. Taking a risk a while back and purchasing this camera (at a much higher price than 749) I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the pictures. The Zeiss lens that the camera has just takes absolutely beautiful pictures. Being a fool, I gave this camera  away as a gift thinking I would be able to take even better photos with the Nikon 990, eventually shelling out more for the Nikon but getting the same performance with a little better control on the white balance. Now that I've experienced not only the DSCS70, the 990, but also the Olympus 3030Zoom, I'm itching to once again get this camera. The one recommendation I can give when buying this camera is that you buy the 64mb memory stick and get an extra battery. I personally can't wait for sony to release a 128mb stick for this camera which I think is to be released some time this year.","I needed a quick easy to use, high quality digital camera.  I've owned five already including the Olympus D-400, D-450 and C-3030.  I think the Olympus C-3030 is very high quality but requires four PhD's to learn how to use it.  I am not an amateur.  I've taught photography and I've built 15 different computer systems over the years.  I am a professional in presentation software, for example.  The Olympus C-3030 was an expensive disappointment.  This Sony camera has great optics and --- once you spend a little time learning it --- an extremely simply menu system!  I can take pictures of clients and rapidly download them and embed them into a Powerpoint presentation.  Others have noted the flaws: the USB cable is simply 'not ready for prime time' and the 8mb memory stick is a joke.  So: if you want a great digital camera (that can do excellent 5-15 second video clips--- something I really need) then get this camera and a PCMCIA adapter [and] an extra battery and two 64mb memory sticks [and] you'll have a great system to use.  Toss the USB cable and write a letter of complaint to Sony for not providing the PCMCIA adapter.  The attached unlosable lens cap is a good idea, but an automatically hidable one (as on some other cameras) would have been better.  Including all the goodies and a case in one 'kit' would have been smart and should have been done at the same price.  Putting the microphone in front instead of on top would have been a good idea, too.  Letting the user record 60 second video clips would have been great, too. But as a usable high quality system: I currently haven't found a better one.  And as a tool to photograph the misbehaviors of neighborhood vandals, it's been proving to be a godsend.  With some specialized accessories, it sits, high in a second floor window with an external powersupply and an intervalometer plus a motion sensor.  It gets GREAT shots, even in very low light!","If you're looking for a digital camera that will give you film level quality (3.3 megapixels of data capture) in an easy to use, compact package, the Sony DSC-S70 is a great choice.  Not only does it take wonderful pictures in a variety of settings, but it also comes with a lot of small, easy to forget about features that add up to a great overall usage experience and that make the camera a much better real value than most of its competitors.<br />Some of these include an internal, rechargeable Lithium Ion battery that shows you, in minutes, how much more time you have left before recharging is required, a built in USB port (no external cradles are required), all required cables, a built in memory stick slot and included memory stick (although the included 8MB stick is too small, you should definitely pick up at least a 32MB stick), and an AC adapter included (believe it or not, a lot of digital cameras don't come with an AC adapter and since digicams eat up batteries this really makes a big difference).<br />These types of small things are often overlooked in reviews, but in long-term, real-world use, they really do make a difference.<br />The only negatives that I've experienced are things that other reviewers have mentioned, the included memory stick is too small and the camera does not come with a carrying case, which you should definitely get if you plan on traveling with the camera.<br />Some quick notes, while the camera works flawlessly with both Windows 98 and MacOS based computers, a Windows 2000 driver does not yet seem to be available.","This is not exactly a review, as I am thinking seriously about getting this camera...However, someone made an error and/or typo regarding the zoom specs, including those that reviewed it.  I cannot believe some folks don't know their own camera!  Sorry, but this model digital camera has a 6X digital zoom, NOT a 2X!  It plainly says it on the right side of the camera in big bold black letters, and also in the technical specs.<br />Just an observation, and not my own humble opinion...Seriously though the DSC-S70 looks like a very good camera, and I am not a camera guru, but for the average user, it should be more than adequate, and then some.  Thanks as all of the reviews were quite helpful.  I just may get this camera indeed....","I had read reviews for two weeks trying to decide which digital camera to  buy.  I had it narrowed down the the Coolpix 990, Olympus C3000/C3030 and  the Sony DSC-S70.  With all four of these in the store, I had a great  opportunity to compare.  I chose the DSC-S70 at the recommendation of the  sales person who also owned one.  It is very easy to use out of the box and  you can get as deep as you want into the many features of the camera.  The  pictures are very impressive - excellent resolution with vibrant colors!  I  am having a blast with the movie feature - excellent for e-mails.  The  rechargeable battery has a long life and is quickly recharged.  I did buy a  64M memory stick and that has been very adequate, the 8M does not cut  it.<br />  I highly recommend this camera.  If you do a lot of shooting I  would definitely purchase another battery and a larger memory stick  however.","I read the reviews (both in magazines and online forums) and have to say  this camera is quite good.  Great resolution (hey, its 3 megapixels, that  should say it all!), execllent color, impressive zoom.  The one thing I  wish this camera had was a flipout screen like the model below it, the  dsc-s50.  Perhaps that is something Sony can implement in future  models.<br />Again, as nearly everyone has eluded to, the biggest problem is  the 8mb memory stick.  Save yourselves the hassle and order a higher  capacity stick the moment you buy the camera.  I would also suggest picking  up a sony case for the camera.  Its only $20.  The model number is  lsc-csc<br />Available accessories are as follows:<br />MSA-32A/64A Memory Stick  Media (forget the 8 or 16mb sticks)  MSAC-PC2 Type II PC Card Reader (for  those of us w/ laptops)<br />PHD-A55 CyberFrame, Digital Photo Frame (very  cool but expensive!!!)<br />DPP-MS300 Memory Stick Printer (I'd wait for the  new one coming)<br />MSAC-FD1A Memory Stick Floppy Disk Adapter<br />MSAC-PR1 PC  Card Reader (if you have USB, don't need it)<br />NP-FM50/70/90 InfoLithium  Battery (could help heavy users)<br />HVL-1000 Externally mounted light (not  needed)","I considered and compared digital cameras that were pricier than the S70.  However, the S70 earned my money because of its image quality, ease of use, and USB connectivity.<br />In the past, Sony built good cameras with  innovative features; however, the image quality has always been suspect in  the minds of aspiring photo amateurs and professionals.  With the DSC-S70,  Sony got it right!<br />One of the reasons that older Sony digital cameras had  mediocre image quality was because of their mediocre lenses.  Sony knew  this; so, they found someone who was really good at making lenses: Carl  Zeiss.  For me, the most impressive feature of this camera is the 21 mm  Carl Zeiss, Vario-Sonnar lens.  I've used and admired Zeiss optics for many  years in film photography.  This lens yields excellent resolution, coupled  with brilliant colors.  Lesser lenses yield images with a focused center;  however, the edges and corners would not be as sharp.  Not with this camera  -- every pixel is clear and the details are impressive for even the most  discerning eyes.<br />Another reason that I got this camera is because of the  wide variety of apertures and shutter speeds.  The aperture ranges from  f/2.0 to f/8.0 and the shutter speed can vary from 8 to 1/1000 seconds.  Although the S70 doesn't feature a full manual exposure mode, you get a  reasonable degree of control.<br />At the time I got this camera, Sony only  offered Windows 95 & 98 drivers.  I'm delighted that Sony now offers  support for Windows 2000.  Installation was a breeze.  You can find the  Win2K drivers here on Sony's site ...<br />The battery life is  pretty good.  On a full charge, you can take roughly 2 hours worth of use.  The battery meter is pretty accurate, which indicates the number of minutes  remaining.  Although the memory stick technology is proprietary, it's easy  to use and very convenient.  The 8 MB memory stick that comes with the  camera is pathetic.  You need more to take many high resolution pictures,  preferably the 64 MB, which is the Sony's largest to date.  Rumor has it  that Sony is making a 128 MB version of their popular memory stick -- way  cool!  I would recommend getting an extra battery and a 64 MB memory stick  -- using the 8MB memory stick as an emergency only backup.<br />Good luck, and  have fun with your new S70!","This camera... *  Produces great images:  - Clear, nearly 35mm-quality  images are created using the 3.3 mega pixels resolution  - Zooming is  excellent using the 3x optical, 2x digital zoom  - Focusing is easy using  its auto-focus feature for typical use, or using five levels of pre-set  focus levels plus a macro setting for close-ups *  Is easy to use:  -  Lightweight and compact with good, wide camera strap (included)  -  Includes great features like self-timer  -  Batteries & memory sticks  are easy to swap when necessary *  Requires a couple additional investments  to make it perfect, as do nearly all digital cameras:  -  An extra  battery (~$60) is helpful as you delete and retake photos  -  A 64MB  extra memory stick (~$175) is helpful so you can record more photos<br />The  included software is easy to use, as is the speedy USB-port uploading.  A  memory stick disk adapter is available for folks who would rather upload  their images using their floppy drive, although using that adapter is  considerably slower than using the USB cable.<br />This camera is a fantastic  value at under $800 plus the couple other suggested investments, especially  with Amazon.com's terrific customer service behind it.","This is a good camera but it takes a while to learn I beleive thats why  the poor reveiw. I have used 4 digital cameras and chose it over the  olympus 3.3 megapixel which has a high rating. But being a electronic  technician for 30 years the switches on the olympus looked like they  couln't wait to break. This camera is sturdy and will last a long time.","I bought the S70 about two months ago and I shot a lot of pictures with  it: its light weight, compact size and ease of use even with one hand (the  right of course :) ) make the perfect digital camera for ME. I was really  impressed by the quality of its pictures (colors, shades, contrast...)  although I've read a pretty bad review about it in a magazine. As many  other digital cameras, there are many features such as crop/resize a  picture, choose between 6 different resolutions, zoom in a picture (to look  for a specific detail for instance), USB connection to your PC (which is a  lot faster), optical and digital zoom (even though I don't recommend using  the digital one unless you're perfectly still), several effects (sepia,  black and white, solarize, negative and two or three others), a viewfinder  with a focus ring (very convenient at night, believe me, you can't see  anything using the LCD display)... you can even shoot a movie with it! Why  only 4 stars ? Simply because it comes with a 8Mo memory stick (come on  Sony! we can't do anything with 8Mo unless we use the 640x480 resolution!),  there is no carrying case or something to protect it and the menu is not  that intuitive... it can get pretty complicated to find what you're looking  for when you don't know your camera. However, it's still very easy to  use... turn it on, point and shoot... delete if you're not satisfied and  try again! Want to have a look at your pictures ? Turn a switch to  \"play mode\" and use the arrows of a small pad to navigate among  them, delete, resize... then just plug your USB connector to your PC and  with the driver installed, a removable disk appears on your machine, just  like a zip drive or a hard drive! Drag and drop your pictures where you  want. The stamina rechargeable battery allows you to know exactly how much  time you have. In short, I think the S70 is worth the price you pay for it  even if you'll have to buy another memory stick (around $140 for a 64Mo but  you can go with a 32Mo). It has all the features of the other digital  cameras of its range of prices plus others, the quality of the picture is  commendable (and again I'm not talking about the 3.3 megapixels resolution  which is obviously excellent but the colors, contrast...) and it's easy to  use, except for the menu. I've used it in trade shows, parties with  friends, during weekends (sceneries...), I've even taken some pictures from  a plane! Last but not least, even if I print a lot of pictures with this  camera, using a pretty good Epson printer (but not a photo printer, no need  for it), I still have a good 35mm when I want to have a professional  result. That makes sense, doesn't it?","I bought the S70 about two months ago and I shot a lot of pictures with it: its light weight, compact size and ease of use even with one hand (the  right of course :) ) make the perfect digital camera for ME.

I was impressed with the feel and weight of this camera,  it's a pleasure to  use.  The color and resolution surpasses anything my 1.3 pixcels camrea  did,  The S70 give me great choice of image sizes,  I use 1280x960 most  of the time, this size makes fine 8x10 and excellent 4x6 prints.  The  ability to trim and enlarge a pic in the camera before downloading into the  computer is only one of the many fascinating features of this camera.  I  also purchased a Sony floppy disc adaptor for the Memory Stick making it  easy to use with most any computer. I've been using the S70 for a little  over a month and try something different nearly every day.

(I also have a digital Canon camcorder/still camera- which I am very unhappy with.) This is EZ to operate.  And if you don't use the screen viewer while taking regular pictures I found that the rechargeable batteries last a very long time! Its small, convenient and EZ to operate.  The pictures are amazing!<br />The short video clip capability is good,however the sound on the video is only marginal.<br />But otherwise a fantastic choice! UNlike Canon FujiFilm delivered as promised, I am a very happy and satisfied customer.  Fuji does Digital well!","This camera cannot be appreciated based on its specifications alone. The intangible qualities are what make this camera an excellent choice for anyone simply wanting great quality pictures from a camera that operates like a film camera, but has all the advantages of a digital camera.<br />- The pictures are excellent (especially the color), although low-light pictures are a little grainier than I would like.<br />- The flash is VERY powerful considering the camera's small size.<br />- Stainless steel body seems very durable, feels solid in your hand<br />- Camera operates very fast: turning on/off, menu navigation, shutter/autofocus delay, flash recharge, switching modes. In my opinion, this is one of the most important features of any digital camera, and most don't have it!<br />- Battery life is excellent! Only 2 AA's easily last for a day of normal use. I usually get at least 2 days out of them. Fuji has really shown their excellence in this area... the power saving features have obviously made a huge difference.<br />Conclusion: If you want a: 3X optical zoom, pocket-sized camera, for everyday use, that works like a film camera (i.e. very easy to use, and fast), feels like a high-quality product (not a cheap plastic toy), you MUST get this camera. You WON'T be dissapointed.<br />WARNING: If you want extensive manual control, DO NOT get this camera. You WILL be dissapointed.<br />...","I purchased this camera about two weeks ago. It's an awesome camera.  The picture quality is very, very good.  A friend of mine had this camera for about a year, and he recomended it to me.  I've been taking pictures with it around the city and at some clubs, it's great. The movie option is very cool, you can capture up to 80 seconds of the movie.  The nightscene feature is also very cool.  I took some pictures at a club, where the lighting was very low, and if there's light's in the background, or moving light, the picture comes out with a cool trail effect. It also has a manual mode.  The only thing about this camera is that the batteries run out kind of fast, but what can you do it's a high powered device.  So if I was going to go out I'd take an extra set of batteries with me.  This camera takes 2 1450 mah, or 2 1600 mah NI-MH rechargable batteries, it also takes NI-CD batteries.  Monster Cable makes 1800 Mah batteries, but when I called Fuji, they said that those weren't recomended to use with this camera.  You can get a charger set with 4 batteries ...  Also in the manual and on the box it says that this camera accepts up to 64Mb SmartMedia Card, but on here in the accesories it says that you can go up to 128mb, and Viking support center said the same thing. I purchased the 128mb card and it works just fine. At 1280x960 resolution with fine quality I can take 204 pictures, which is more then enought.  I would also recomend getting a SmartMedia Card reader which conects through the USB port.  That way you don't drain the batteries when you're transfering pictures from the card to your computer, and it also works faster.  For the price I'd say that this is the best choice.","This is one hell of a camera! But be prepred to have 2 or 3 sets of fully charged batteries on hand, as you can't get through a smart card on a set of 2 batteries. Nor can they be charged in the camera, so the downside is having to travel with lots of (rechargeable) batteries and the charger, and perhaps an extra one for the car. But it's a small bother compared to the pleasure this inexpensive, compact camera gives you, the amateur or pro photographer, with sharp bright pictures that make you feel more talented than you really are!","Despite paying nearly double the current price because I bought it when it first came out, I still feel I've had excellent value. It's an easy to use, fast, enjoyable piece of kit. Fuji after sales service is also excellent (refreshingly so). I bought a larger memory card (128meg) giving me the capacity for 700 good quality snaps - fantastic on a long holiday. Download time is virtually instant with the USB cable. If I were buying now, I'd look at Fuji's other models first, but you cant go wrong with this one. The only niggle I can think of is that the zoom isnt great. Enjoy.","This camera takes fabulously clean pictures. They don't look digital. The colors are pretty. Compared with a Kodak, the colors are muted, easier on the eyes. The Kodak looked like a TV screen with the brightness and contrast overdone.<br />I used it for about a year, and it quit. I must admit that I had dropped it hard once, and it had just gone through a mountain approach during a high wind advisory (I take it in my light plane). So, I really can't fault the camera. Turned out it needed a new flash board. Took 5 weeks and [amt] after sending it to Fuji NJ. I don't consider that bad service, and something you should think about before buying an off-brand asian wonder. I doubt any corner camera shop is doing to do much to a digital beyond cleaning.<br />2400x1800 is great for digital zooming later. Or, for printing, but it is impolite for sharing photographs due to the upload time. It has 9 resolution settings. Three for # of pixels and within them three compression settings. I set it on 1280x960 and average compression. This gives me 99 pics on the supplied 32meg card, about 250k per pic, and great picture quality.<br />The only criticism I can think of is that the flash stinks. I like a bounce flash, and this doesn't have the option. Red eye galore. You have to edit it out later. However, anything with a better or external flash is a lot bigger, so choose your tradeoffs.<br />Scott","I bought my Fuji 4700 in 1999. I've have had  about 4 digital cameras and was not really happy with any of them. I debated quiet a while before I spent $$$ for A camera. I finally bought the Fuji. It only took me about 2 days to learn everything the camera could do. The instructions were so simple and explained well enough a 6 yr old could understand them and learn to use the camera.I've had the camera for 2 yrs now and nothing on the market can compare with it. I have A 64MB Memory card in it and can take 996 pictures in the basic mode and 362 pictures in the fine mode. I dare any Professional Developer to print a better 8x10 picture than my fuji takes. I don't think I will ever need a updated camera.","Nice camera that takes very good pictures. The sensor needs very good lighting to take the best (sharpest) images. The images taken inside with the flash are not as good as the pictures taken with good natural outside lighting.","Read the manual and it gets easy as pie to take fantastic photos.  I recomend monster ni-mh batteries at 1800 mh they work great in this very power hungry digital. This is my 2nd digital and it is so much better it is unbelieveable, although I learned alot about light capabilities compared to film with the low res digital. My pics turn out great even on my old lazer printer a photo printer might be better but I am very satisfied with what I got. The high res mode is great very clear and clean, it makes touch ups and special effects a breeze.  Extra mem cards and batteries are a must.  Anyone with any photo experience will find this a dream come true.","I did alot of research before buying this camera. I was looking for a camera that had three specific qualities. 1)Easy to use for the beginner. 2) Produce quality 8' x 10\" photos. 3) Movie mode. This little Fuji fits the bill in all three categories and on top of that the price is very reasonable compared to other cameras and I definitely like its distinct, compact look. To me, it has an oldtime European look to it. This camera produces very high quality photos using its highest setting. I would prefer a stronger flash for indoor shots but for outdoor shots its perfect. The colors on outdoor shots are just amazing. This little camera only uses (2) AA batteries instead of the typical 4. The batteries do last surprisingly long. I was able to click off 36 high resolution shots with flash and LCD screen on and power lasted over an hour. The batteries that come with it are excellent at 1600 mah. I also picked up some rechargeable Monster Cable AA's from 800.com, they are 1800mah and are very long lasting. NOTE: I couldnt wait to for the batteries to charge when i got the camera so I used some duracells. I went through a 4 pack in 10 minutes. Only use these batteries in dire emergency situations. They are not meant to be used for digital camera no matter how much they claim to be. At first the controls on this camera seem complex, but once you actually get into using it you find out how logical the placement of the controls are. Just spend one hour with the manual and camera and you will be an expert on this camera. Also, you can hook this camera up to your TV and play the movie back and do a slide show of all the pictures. I did this for family members at a get together, took orders of who wanted which picture and then printed them out so they would have instant photos of only the ones they wanted. Big WOW factor there! I am sure there are better digital cameras out there, but if you are looking for the criteria that I listed and want get it at a great price this is the one.","I love the fuji finepix 4700 zoom.  It takes great pictures, and is really small, but there are a few weaknesses. 1.No manual focus ring/you have to use buttons/hard 2.No shutter/apurture priority mode 3.A little hard to hold/finger gets in the way of lens 4.Zoom buttons to close to veifinder/fingers get in the way of your eyes 5.No 1600X1200 mode<br />Other than that-this camera has everything- Great resolution 2.4 mp-4.3mp interpolated Great software easy-instant usb-pictures are sent to computer automatically in 3 seconds-thats all! Flash modes Compression modes up to 1/2000 of a second shutter.","I shopped around for my first digital camera (also looking at Canon and Olympus models) with the following primary criteria: ease of portability, quality of images, and ease of use.<br />Firstly, this camera is a great size, making it easy to carry wherever you go. I wanted the freedom to take photos without processing delays and costs, and also the freedom to carry a camera wherever and whenever, and it has certainly been possible with the 4700z. The zoom lens retracts and is automatically covered when you turn off the camera, making a lens cap and/or strap completely unnecessary. The flash also pops down when not in use.<br />The quality of the photos produced by the 4700z is exceptional. You will immediately notice (especially on a nice day outside) the vibrant colours and clarity. I have had success with the macro mode and the optical zoom also (remember not to factor digital zoom into your purchasing decision with *any* camera).<br />The camera is also very easy to use. You can hand the camera to someone, point out a few buttons (mostly zoom and save/discard), and they'll have no problem in taking a great photo.<br />Buy an extra storage card or two (I have 2 32's and the 16 which came with the camera), and take both sets of batteries when you go out for the day. When taking photos at sporting events, try to get closer to the action rather than relying on the zoom - when you zoom, you accentuate player movement, and also your own movement. Also, try using it with a tripod - I've taken some good photos during the day or at night with a tripod.<br />Finally, the two problems I've discovered in 6 months with the camera have done nothing to put me off it. I would happily make the purchase again if given the opportunity. The two problems have been: left-most button around the secondary LCD requires more force to push than the others; and the flash often needs a nudge to pop it up. Both pretty minor issues.","purchased camera about two weeks ago and have not been able to put it down, even in 2400x1200 basic my photos are as good as my cannon 35mm. i also reccomend buying a 64mg smartcard. at my setting i can fit 168 pics. i print on the hp 930c printer with hp premium gloss photo paper and only the experts can tell that i developed my own pictures. this camera is head over heals over the fugi 40i. although it does not have an mp3 player, the settings on this camera are professional (portrait, distance, night scenes). do yourself a favor and pick up one of these cameras today. i have tried them all and this is tops.","I'd used a 35 mm for years, and was resisting  purchasing a digital camera until I found one that could provide the same flexibility and creativity of manual control, as well as the ease of automatic control,  and provide for high-quality blow up prints.  This camera is it, and at the price I paid at Amazon.com, do not feel I  could have made a better choice for the money.<br />The 3x optical zoom is a breeze, and the digital zoom is icing on the cake. The instructions are clear and concise both for camera operation AND for syncing with a PC and using the software. Whether your version of Windows will find the right driver automatically, or if you have to step in to the gap and do it manually, set up takes minutes, and you're ready to snap, focus, shoot, sync.<br />I recommend it!  ...","This is my first digital camera, and after several months of research, I could not be more pleased with this purchase.  It is easy to use for a beginner but has enough advanced features that I don't anticipate that the average home / business user would outgrow it quickly.<br />The menus are easy to navigate, even for someone not particularly adept at with the conventional functionalities of a digital camera.  In spite of its small size, it is sturdy and seems pretty durable.<br />Definitely upgrade to a 64MB SmartMedia card and order extra batteries as well.  Battery life is acceptable but they do have a tendency to run down rather quickly (especially if the LCD screen is used a lot.)  The batteries are relatively inexpensive and it's nice that in a pinch, Alkaline AA batteries could be used.<br />To date, I've taken over 200 photographs with the camera.  The performance is good and the cyle times between photographs and for power up are above average for a camera in this price range.  Printed photographs are excellent, even with a relatively low-end color inkjet printer utilizing photo paper.<br />Besides the quality, it is just plain fun to use and generally gets a \"wow.. cool camera\" comment from others.<br />If you are considering a digital camera, this one should be on your short list, especially at the current price.","I have been analog photography enthusiast for over 20 years.  I shoot about 50 rolls of film per year and my regular equipment includes top of the line Nikon's and Canon's cameras and lenses.  So my expectations of picture quality from a digital camera were pretty high before I bought the Fuji 4700.  My decision to buy Fuji was based on high resolution spec of 4.3 Megapixels. I was very pleasantly surprised with Fuji 4700.  Everything I was looking for in terms of camera's feature and capabilities is there and more.  The greatest surprise came however when I printed my first photos.  I have a relatively inexpensive Canon Photo Printer BJC-8200.  Unless you look real close (like 10 inches or closer) the quality of 8x10 prints is virtually indistinguishable from analogs.  I found out that the key to great picture quality is to use high quality glossy paper -- I use the same paper that came with the Canon printer (I think it is made or marketed by Canon).  I had mixed results with other brands although I am sure there must be some brands that are equaly good or even better.  Bottom line, I love Fuji 4700.  It is fun to use and gives great results. If I had to improve one thing it would be the curved handle on the front of the camera--it does not feel 100% comfortable but given everythinhg else, it is a minor inconvenience. I guess Fuji recognized that and fixed it in the 4800 model.","I bought this camera for my Husband after doing some research here on the net.  I don't know anything about digital camera's so I had to rely on what I read here at amazon.  I made a good choice with the Fuji 4700.  My Husband loves it. He carries it with him all the time since it's so small and compact.  The pictures that he has taken are awesome, and when he prints them out people can't believe it's from a digital camera.  Thanks to amazon for the info. and the good price.","You can use auto focus or manual focus, however, make sure your subject remains still for either.  The manual focus requires pushing buttons rather than rotating a lens like standard cameras.  It is difficult to do.<br />The auto focus feature consists of two steps.  You line the subject in the center of the viewfinder and press the shutter button halfway.  It sets the focus and then you can click the button fully to record the image.  The problem I had with it is that by the time the camera \"set\" the focus, my subject (a 10 month old) was in the next room.  Neither focus feature is good for anything more than still photography.","As a new user--my cameras were film type and I had my feelings were that digital was not as sharp as I would like.  I have been suprised with the Fuji 4700 as the pictures are as sharp as with my Nikon and print on my inkjet printer in 8by10 format as sharp or sharper than my Nikon.  I am very pleased with the camera and would recommend the Fuji 4700 to anyone thinking about buying a digital camera.","The FujiFilm FinePix 4700 zoom is my second FujiFilm digital camera.  I took a close look at the new small and cute Canon Elph.  But the Elph gives up some important features for the same price.  Make no mistake, this is a fine camera and I am awed by the flexible features packed into such a small size.  Here are some features that I have have found invaluable:<br />PROS<br /> o The Photograph Mode Dial feature is one step up from a fully auto point and shoot camera.  I am very impressed by the Portrait, Landscape and especially the Night Scene modes.  They are optimized settings and take exceptional pictures under those conditions. I found it easy to twist the dial, shoot, then compare results taken in different modes.  Dramatic.  For me this is the single most useful feature of this camera, its implementation is easy and effective.<br />o Generally, for film speeds of ISO 100 you have to keep the camera very still for sharp pictures.  So a faster film speed as this FinePix camera has is a big advantage. This camera has a base film speed of ISO 200 and settable up to ISO 800. (Canon is ISO 100)<br />o Get as large a LCD display as possible.  This one has a 2 inch screen (vs. 1.5 for Canon).  If you use the LCD for framing a shot or to review a shot taken, a nice large screen is worth the extra size in a the camera.<br />o Stay away from unique batteries.  More than once I have wanted to take that \"must have picture\" only to have forgotten my spare batteries in the car, or to find that they were dead.  AA size batteries can be found anywhere, even if you have to take a flashlight appart to get that important shot.  These NiH batteries are 1/10 the cost of Canon's Li batteries.<br />I have owned the FinePix 4700 for one month now.  The FinePix is much more efficient in battery use compared to the older FujiFilm DX-10.  FinPix uses 2 batteries vs. the 4 in the DX-10, and lasts just as long.  This makes it possible for the camera to be lighter by 2 batteries.<br />o The 3X zoom is very nice.  Canon has only 2x (although in Japan I have now seen an Elph with 3x zoom).<br />oSmartMedia seems to be more available and prices are coming down.  If you haven't already discovered, SmartMedia with a PCMCIA adapter is the perfect replacement for floppy discs, especially if you own a notebook computer.<br />CONS oThe viewfinder is small, especially if you wear glasses.  Using the veiwfinder does save on battery power, so hopefully FujiFilm will address this in the next model.  Then I will give it 5 stars.<br />o After one month of heavy use, the Auto Focus does not work and the camera is broken.  I have been unable to get through the busy phone lines at Fuji Film in Edison NJ.  At the moment I have given up trying to get through.  Fortuantely, I live in Japan where service is still first class and the local Fuji dealer accepted my camera for warranty repair.  It will take a month ;-(  Take notice Fuji Photo Film America!  Answer your phone lines and voice messages!","The FinePix 4700 offers an excellent combination of: - convenient size (handy leather pouch fits on the belt) - high resolution (3 different resolutions and sizes) - easy interface to computer with the USB - good performance under difficult lighting etc<br />It gets 4 stars from me and not 5 stars because: - has no wide angle mode.  Can't take panorama pics.  Quite a pity because the wider angle is especially useful for interior shots.  And the Panorama would also be great to have - more zoom would be useful - a little more closeup would be useful in macro shots.<br />Other points: - don't get fooled by the so-called 4.7mil pixels - this is an extrapolation and represents no real increase in resolution over the approx. 2.3 mil pixels available.  A less deceiving name for the camera would be FinePix 2300. - the leather pouch would be greatly improved if it had a little space to comfortable accept 2 extra batteries, since an extra set should always be on hand when travelling.<br />-  get the larger sized memory card and get an extra one too (fits in the leather pouch nicely).<br />I use my FinePix 4700 to document my work.  It sees almost daily use.  I am very satisfied with the product.  When travelling I have 2 memory cards and can take up to about 50 high resolution photos (which I rarely use), about 300 or so medium resolution photos (which I usually use) and something like 1000 or so low resolution photos (which I rarely use since they are VERY low resolution)<br />If they could get a wider angle and panorama then it would suit my purposes exactly.  As it is I am nevertheless quite satisfied with my purchase.","Takes excellent pictures.  Would prefer more extreme close-up capability.  About 18 inches is as close as you can get.<br />Detail in high resolution mode is incredible.  Always sharp pictures except in closest close up mode.  NO warning indicator when you have gotten too close on close-ups.  So they end up  fuzzy.<br />But, no worries - just erase it and do it over.<br />Controls can be easily bumped to the wrong setting without  realizing it.<br />Would like to have external flash hot shoe or socket.<br />Need to get at least the 32Mb smartmedia to keep from constantly swapping out memory when taking very many pictures.","it's good for use , I impress it so much. You can to try test it.","Bought for no messing, straight forward family pics and this little beauty does the trick. The AVI feature is handy for a bit of live action, though the quality of picture and sound can never beat a dedicated movie camera. Buy it if you want a great quality no nonsense digital camera.","This is a very good camera - I bought it right before a couple of grandkids came along.  My wife has been ambivalent about digitals because she wanted quality shots like she gets from her 35 milimeter camera.  The quality I get from this camera (and I am a picture taking amateur) is at least as good as she gets with her quality 35.  The batteries do a good job compared to my other digital camera.  I would suggest the 64 mg memory card.  With it, you get 38 highest res pictures at a time.  Also, the usb transfer is so much similar that what I had with my old digital.  My son bought the high end Sony (the fd95) and this Fuji takes as good pictures, the difference is that he gets 10x zoom.  I wish I had 10x zoom - but he wishes he had back the $500 more he spent on his camera than I spent on mine.","I had purchased this digital camera around November, 2000, and I am still enjoying every picture I take with it. It fits in my pocket (a big plus), the pictures are easy to download, and the image quality is quite good. The picture quality is great and it is quite easy to get used to. Two friends of mine have the camera and had recommended it to me. I am extremely satisfied with my choice.","Rather than saying what I like about this camera, I'll just say the one thing I don't like about it - it creates AVI files for videos which I can play using the EXIF viewer, and also (surprisingly) using netscape on linux, but *not* on many other platforms.  Why not create mpeg movies?  AVI is not a standard format, it's a cruel joke from Microsoft - some files play on one installation of windows but not another and who knows why ... If anybody knows of a avi->mpeg converter that will work with movies created by the Fuji camera (I've tried a few already and none work) please let me know (wayne@icemcfd.com).  Also an email to Fuji seems to have fallen into a black hole...","Earlier I reported that the AVI's were not 100% compatible and that friends I sent them to were not able to play them.<br />I spoke to Fuji tech support tonight and they indicate that you must use Quicktime to view the 4700's AVI files. Not a big problem if you know ahead of time.<br />Still very happy with the camera. With the new ... price, it is really attractive now!","Just received this camera - along with a bunch of accessories - in the mail.  Started using it this weekend.  It appears to be relatively user-friendly.  There is a lot of technology packed into this little item.  So far I've been taking pictures on medium resolution since I'm trying to learn how to use it.  But so far I'm quite impressed.  Plugged it into our large screen TV and was impressed with the pics.  Next I want to try downloading the pics into my computer at home.","Great camera, I would recommend to anyone.  The price for such a high resolution is unbelievable.  The only thing that could improve on this camera is the Zoom.","This camera is great.If you whant it you should by it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I understood from the get-go that this wasn't a 4 megapixel camera.  I don't plan on printing poster sized photographs and my needs are strictly under the category of \"ambitious amateur,\" therefore this wasn't an issue. The price is very competitive with other mid-range cameras when you consider all of the features and the rich quality of its images.  I appreciated having the option of capturing short videos with sound.  Moreoever, for someone who hates to read instruction manuals, I found that the manual was easy to reference and that the onboard menu was very, very intuitive.<br />I would order a 64 MB SmartMedia card and an high speed NIMH battery charger if you intend to maximize your use of the camera, especially if you like making short video clips and/or using the LCD screen.<br />The pictures printed beautifully on my Epson 880 and I am very happy with my purchase.  I have yet to try to connect it to my television for viewing or perhaps transfering to video format a short clip, but its a nice option to have if you're into that sort of thing.","Overall I am delighted with the functionality and form factor of this camera, in spite of a few weaknesses. The weaknesses are: 1) It eats batteries. The first accessory I bought was a MAHA MH-C204F home/car charge and two sets of 1600mAh batteries. The second was the AC adapter for use while dumping the pix to the computer. 2) There is significant barrel distortion on wide angle shots. This is widely reported, but should not be considered a show stopper. 3)The AVI files generated in movie mode appear to be non-standard. After installing the Fuji S/W to my machine, Windows Media Player handled these just fine. When sent to relatives (who didn't have the Fuji software), WMP could not play the video and provided only sound. I don't regret my purchase for a minute, and would highly recommend this camera.","Well I have just bought this camera and find it fascinating..It is so small yet create great pictures. I originally wanted a small pocket digital that is capable of imitating film and I believe I have found the best 'right now' at it. This camera is the size of a pack of cigarettes. Ok OK yes I like the size.  Features I like... Lens cap built in, Lens quality, incredibly easy software transfer (mind you I use Thumbsplus for viewing and Explorer for copying and pasting to my hard drive), Logical controls, USB interface, Recycle time is incredible .2sec, Image quality. I have made 5x7's and 8x10's out of files downloaded and printed out at a pro lab. Excellent but do not make prints over 8x10's...you may not like them.","The Fuji has most of the good ergonomics of the earlier model but they have mysteriously changed the battery system. Both the Fuji and the Leica models had an internally chargeable battery which lasted well and was very convenient. The 4700 requires AA batteries-if you use the screen, they will not last long. I've also found frequent and vexing problems with the camera not wanting to accept smartmedia cards it previously used. This is intermitent but annoying enough to warrant testing a card before you rely on it. The camera is a nice weight and produces great pictures but I am not sure that it's a quantum leap over its predecessor.","After a long month of researching cameras, I finally decided to buy this one. If you are seriously considering this camera, look around for prices, as they vary greatly from one place to the other. First of all, while this isn't a true 4.3MP camera, I think it outperforms 3.3 and 3.1MP hands down. THe resolution, color warmths, color accuracy and sharpness is amazing for a camera of this size...or for any digital camera any size. I have had this camera for a month now and I have never been so proud of an electronics purchase...of course I love my Mac too! Here is a list of PROS and CONS:<br /><br />Pros<br /> - The retraction of the lens which gets covered by a metal door is excellent.<br /> - The flash works surprisingly well. I used the camera in Times Square in New York (for those who don't know where Times Square is), and the faces came out with a good amount of light, while the backround lights of Times Square came out very nicely also. This camera takes VERY impressive night shots. I think it does better when it is set to AUTO than when it is set to NIGHT mode, although you can create some pretty funky shutter delay shots and play with lights and colors.<br /> - The Movie mode is great! Sure, it is not broadcast quality, but what did you expect. I think it takes better movies than the Sony Mavicas.<br /> - The USB connection is great. The smart media compartment works well too.<br /> - YES! You can set a timer to take pics..up to five seconds I think.<br /> - Looks like it came from the Matrix<br /> - Want flash? Pop it up. Don't want flash, pop it down. It is the easy.No buttons to press, no setting to set.<br /> - Many ISO to choose from, as well as Macro<br /> - TOP .JPG resolution is great. Don't be fooled that it doesn't save in .tif formats, the pictures are great! And saves space!<br /> - Comes with 16MB card, not 8MB like most of the other guys.<br /><br />CONS<br /> - The LCD display is difficult to see in bright sunlight, but at least you can use the viewfinder, unlike the Sony Mavica.<br /> - The camera KILLS alkalines, even the ultra alkalines. Don't be stupid. Use the NiHM, 4 are included with the camera, but I suggest going to Radio Shack and buying a quick charge charger. It'll same you lots of money and time, as the included charger takes 12 hours, and only holds 2 batteries.<br /> - I would've liked to see Fuji use the IBM Microdrive in this unit. With soo many memory hungry applications in this camera (movie capture with sound, high resolution images), even the 64MB card which I bought wasn't enough for a weekend with buddies in NYC.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /> I showed the images of the trip to my boss, who is a hardcore Sony maniac. He was soo stunned by the quality and features, and price and size of the camera that he bought one for himself! You can't go wrong with this camera. I love it! And so do the editor's of Popular Photography magazine, who recently gave this model its highest review about it's color accuracy.","I reviewed the spec's on this and other cameras for about a month before making my decision.  My biggest concern was support under NT 2000.  None of the product info or reviews mentioned support for the NT OS, but it works like a champ.  NT2000 usb drivers were even included in on the cdrom!  I had the camera up and running in <5min and was transferring outstanding pictures to my NT2000 laptop in <10min.  A brief reading of the manual unlocked all of the camera's secrets.  The camera provides for control over both pixel count (640x480 to 2400x1800) and image quality (basic-normal-fine).  With the included 16MB chip you get ~49 images at 1200x960 using normal quality -which look great!  However, image count drops to 8 at highest settings.  Definitely thinking about a 32 or 64 MB chip.  Red-eye reduction flash is a little sketchy, still some residual effect.  Only real disappointment is poor battery life when using alkaline batteries -REALLY BAD.. I barely was able to run the set up and have enough power for 4 or 5 flash pictures.  Good thing they included 2 sets of Ni-MH batteries (80-230 shots depending on flash and LCD usage).  My 'old' camera is a Nikon 35mm FM2 and although you could argue that it's comparing apples and oranges, I have no regrets over transitioning to this Fuji digital!","I tried this camera out over the weekend. It's quite handy... the size is really nice, and the lens retracts into the case with a real metal shutter to protect it. The user interface is decent, and the LCD is readable in most conditions. The second \"control\" LCD was a cool design, allowing the user to reuse buttons in both camera and playback modes.<br />I have to agree with others that the image quality is good, but perhaps not to the levels that I've seen with the real 3MP cameras. This is certainly not a true 4MP camera... look at it as a 3MP camera that makes bigger files.<br />I needed to find the manual, since I was borrowing the camera from a friend. I went to fujifilm.com, and was really disappointed with the offering -- I couldn't even find a _mention_ of this camera, let alone drivers/software/manuals! I had much better results on [...] their canadian site. The manual and information on the camera was easy to find there.","This camera is great for all. First and foremost it takes great pictures, the color is second to none. Second, it is as easy to use for the novice as it is to use for the pro. The auto mode works great and the maual mode allows for a lot of adjustments for the pro. The quality is great in any mode. It has three different DPI modes, as well as three different modes within each DPI mode. The small size takes a bit of getting used to though as you tend to think it might be fragile but don't be alarmed as this camera is as tough as they come. I give it 5 stars....","I did an extensive research on this camera, and had a chance to experiment with it for quite a while. The final impression is fairly positive, the good sides clearly outweight the weaker ones.<br />Here is the summary.<br />POSITIVE ===================================================<br /> * Very small and compact size, small weight (~300 gramm with batteries)<br /> * Excellent color representation. Colors are warm and natural. Probably, best color representation of any compact digital camera on the market.<br /> * Fast and 100% painless transition of images to computer; there is absolutely no need to by any additional accessories to that end. Camera mounts itself as a removable drive in Windows Explorer as soon as you plug it in, and you just copy the jpeg files.<br /> * Flash does not pop up by itself; no need to play \"outsmart the flash\" game. If you need to disable it, just close it up.<br /> * Uses smartmedia cards, which is the most compact media to date (less than 1mm thick)<br /> * All small features are extremely well thought-out, as always the case with Japanese companies; and yes, it does have a self-timer and tripod mounting screw.<br />NEGATIVE ====================================================<br /> * The main problem of this camera (and I have not seen this in any prior reviews here) is not the lower-than-advertized resolution (which is huge even as it is, at least equivalent to 2.5+ megapixels), but a so-called \"barrel distortion\". This effect is only present when the camera is set at the widest angle (that is, no zoom). Put simply, this means that if you're looking at a vertical wall at the widest angle, and this wall happens to be at the very side of a viewfinder, it will appear as somewhat swallen outside of the picture. All digital cameras are said to have this effect, but when I looked to check it on this camera, I was able to notice it clearly. If you zoom in, it disappears. Again, I was fully aware of this when I bought the camera, yet that did not affect my choice.<br /> * Picture quality is somewhat lower than it could be for this pixel count; it is certainly lower than advertised 4.3 megapixels.<br /> * no \"black & white\" mode;<br /> * monitor drains power quickly. however, keep in mind that it uses only 2 AA batteries instead of 4, as most of other digital cameras do, and maybe that's why this drain is more pronounced.<br /><br />CONCLUSION ==================================================<br /> Seems to be one of the best compact cameras on the market to-date. However, if I were a professional photographer, I'd get Fuji professional camera, Fuji Finepix S1 Pro for ... For everything other than professional photography, this camera is excellent.","My parents bought this camera and had me install the software and show them how to use it. The box for this camera states that it needs Windows 98, (not supported for Windows 95).  The USB drivers that come with the software won't work on Windows 95 (tried it with on an HP pavillion computer). Ended up buying a smartmedia card adapter that allows the card to be read from the floppy drive which works great....<br />Also the camera is a little akward to hold, its not in the shape of a normal camera. and the lens zoom button is not the easiest to use either (it is on the back of the camera). The microphone for the AVI recording is on the left side of the camera, and its pretty easy to accidentally put your hand over it if holding the camera with both hands.<br />The batteries also take a long time to recharge - 13 hours. Fortunately it came with two sets.<br />The initial AVI clips we made didn't look that good when  viewed in quicktime 4.0, but when they played in the windows media player, it looked a lot better.  I didn't have time to figure out why.<br />This camera was chosen for the better low light sensitivity (ISO 800) and the 3x optical zoom.  Otherwise I would have told my parents to get the Nikon S100 which I own (ISO 100 and only 2x optical zoom though).","This camera is small and light.  It takes great pictures.  Both the clarity is great and the color is vibrant and on the mark.  As a bonus it takes Quicktime movies that you can send over the net if the receiver has a fast connection.  Talking about fast, the download from the USB connection is speedy.  Plus there is little delay after taking the picture until the picture is downloaded and the camera is ready to shoot again.  The camera comes with two sets of rechargeable batteries and the recharger.  Very nice.  But for me, other than the quality of the pictures, I love the size.  I bought the camera for the family, and I don't want to lug a bulky Nikon, so this fits the bill.<br />The only problems that I have experienced are due to the size.  The optical viewfinder is small.  The flash needs to be popped up manually even in auto mode.  That really annoys me since my wife continues to forget to pop up the flash and we get dark pictures.  Hey Fuji, auto should mean auto on the flash too.  Also, you got to watch how your right hand grabs the camera so that you don't cover the auto focus or light reader eye.<br />Obviously, with five stars I am very happy with the camera.  If your not getting good pictures don't blame the camera.","Bought this camera while on vacation in New Orleans.  Added the 64MB SmartMedia Card, and am very happy with it.  Colors are extremely rich and vibrant.  Uploading is a snap using the USB cable.  I don't recommend using AA Alkaline Batteries, as you'll go through them pretty fast.  Get an extra set of the 1600mAh Nickel Metal Hydrides and you'll be set.","If you are a professional photograper or into graphic arts business this digital camera is definitely not for you. This is more of a family use or personal use camera, like when you're going on vacation and you want to take pictures of places and acquaintances (some memories that you want to take home with you kind of thing). You get the resolution that you desire if you read the manual and follow exactly what it tells you to do (experiement and you'd love the results as you go along). I almost gave it a 5 stars but wait, those optional accessories you would need eventually are very hard to find and some are not even available in the market yet. Don't expect too much for that kind of price. If you want the best you should at least spend over 1.5 grand or even higher for a digital camera that suits your taste.","Yes it is, but why doesn't it come with a leather cover case. I use to be  an owner of a FinePix700 for almost 2 years. It's a great cam, except the  alloy case is easy to seperate cause' the fastener screw is so easy to  loose and missing. That's it. Anyway! This FinePix 4700 is really  developed.","This camera has an 80 sec Video feature in JPEG format. That means you can  play the video back on your PC. However, to play it back on your TV, make  sure you buy the camera with the right format. In the USA the TV format is  NTSC, whilst the rest of the world uses the PAL format. Look on the side of  the packaging for the correct format when you buy, as it in not indicated  on the camera itself.","In short...you HAVE to buy this camera.  I spent a week researching and  visiting my local electronic stores comparing, testing and looking up  reviews.  I recommend going to [...] and read the 50+ user reviews  there.<br />No other camera has these benefits at this price: Excellent  battery life, USB ports, fast shutter speed, sleek and compact, excellent  color and quality, 80 seconds of movie making time (w/sound), LCD screen,  ZOOM and many other bells and whistles.<br />I did not buy this camera at the  local stores ($800+) or at Amazon ($750).  I bought from a dealer online  for $645 total (s/h $20 product was $625).  If you don't mind paying the  extra, Amazon is a very reputable dealer.  Hope this helps and POWER to the  consumer!","* Just about every type of control (short of manual exposure) that you could wish for.  The controls are logical and easy to use.  Common  adjustments don't require powering up the LCD * The camera is light and  small enough for a shirt pocket, yet feels very solidly made with its  aluminum magnesium case. * The camera is very fast - no noticable delays  after turn on or after a shot before you can snap the next picture. * No  special expensive batteries needed - just 2 rechargable AA NiMH, NiCd, or  in a pinch standard alkalines * Motion JPEG (Quicktime or with the right  codec AVI) movies - you can shoot about 1 1/2 minutes of 230x240 video and  sound with the included 16MB smart media card (6 mins with the 64MB).  Perfect for sending to grandparents. * very fast and easy picture transfer  and management with USB<br />I'm very pleased with the quality of pictures.  There are a couple of more expensive 2.4 MegaPixel class cameras that have  better lenses, but they have poorer colors than the Fuji.  The Fuji gives  nice bright warm colors that give very nice flesh tones - not cold blue  like many other digital cameras.","I bought this after using a Sony Mavica for about six months.  I loved the Mavica, but wanted better quality images.  This camera has filled that bill very well.<br />Is it perfect?  No, I believe Fuji could have done some things better.  I get error messages from my PC when I use the USB port to  transfer images to my computer, but the images do seem to come across  without error.  When I use the viewfinder, I see only about 75% of the  image that's photographed.  That is, the viewfinder trims off a pretty good  sized border.  Some have referred to this as a 4.7 meg camera.  Perhaps so,  but the quality is about the same as a 2.5 meg camera.<br />The camera is  small.  For someone with big hands, such as me, this took some adjusting  to.  Once I adapted, the controls became easy to use.<br />Photos are stored  in jpeg format, so there's some loss of quality in the image, but I take  all my shots in fine mode, and haven't noticed any problems.  I've not seen  any of the jaggies that I'd occasionally see in the Mavica images.<br />All  images are taken and stored in color.  I wish the camera had a B&W  mode, just to save on disk space when I'm working on that kind of  image.<br />Even so, it does quite a good job, in my opinion.<br />This  is a basic camera.  You won't be able to connect lenses or filters to it.  About the only thing that you'll wish to buy afterward is some additional  memory and perhaps a carrying case.  I suspect that, for most buyers, this  camera will take care of all of their needs.  Others may use it for a  while, and then decide to go on to bigger and better things.  I sold my  Mavica FD-83 when I bought this camera.  I'll probably keep this one when I  move on to a bigger and better product.","I am interested in the new Fuji 4700 camera but I want to be sure it has the practiucal self-timer as well as a screw in port to accomodate a tripod... Can any user provide me an answer to these questions?  Thank you","If you are looking for a quality digital camera that can replace replace a 35MM at less the $1000.00, you found it. The picture quality is just fantastic, it is very easy to use, is loaded with features and the USB and  smartmedia storage disks make it painless for photo storage and transfer. I  was looking for a 2+ mega pixel camera (this unit is 4.7!) that was small  in size (about 1 1/4in think and could fit in my pocket), had USB and  smartmedia disk storage, a 2\" LCD screen, a optical view finder, an optical  zoom lens for less then $1000.00.  This is one impressive camera. I have  been experimenting with it for about a week now and have tested all its  many modes. The ONLY weakness where a high end 35mm can out shine this unit  is in very high-speed action. I was not able to adjust the shutter speed to  freeze the blades of a spinning fan, I could do this w/ my 35mm. BUT IN  EVERY OTHER CATEGORY I think this unit is easier to use and produces as  good if not better then most 35mm. I am not kidding.  A few notes:  Batteries last a lot longer then other dig cameras I have seen due to power  saving features,  The optical zoom is nice (3:1) It has a night mode that  takes great night shots. It has a nice macro mode (for close up photgraphy)  A portrait mode that has great skintones. A landscape mode that config's  the unit to take great outdoor very sharp images of scenery.  Built in  flash autotimer and alot more! Short movie capability w/sound! It is a  small AVI format movie (only 320X200) but it is great for a short clip to  email to a friend. It very easy to use. It has easy to use software for  your PC.<br />2 LCD panels, a 2\" one for photo viewing and a circular one  for camera operation.<br />Modes of operation. There are 3, fine normal and  basic. Use normal for just about everything, except a special shot that you  know you plan to blow up then go to fine. The normal mode is nearly as  clear and sharp as the fine except when enlarged. In a 4X6 test series I  took no one could tell the difference between the 3 pictures. The Default  is set at 2400X1800 \"file size\" (2400x1800, 1280X960, and 640X480 are the  choices (IMO use 2400x1800) and quality set to normal. This is the best  choice IMO (normal w 2400X1800 file size) for most if not all shots. In  this mode you can store 77 photos on a 64MB disk! (19 on the 16 MB) (In  basic mode from 180-996 images on a 64mb disk) Transfering the photos to  your computer is a snap. When you plug in the USB cable to you camera the  software fires up and you see the pics. Click and drag to where you want  them. I also bought the Snadisk smartmeadia reader so I don't have to use  the camera to transfer them. (Looks like a mouse with a 2 in slit in it)  These smart media storage cards are the way to go..the y are about the size  of a large postage stamp and about that thick too and hold 64 MB. I can't  say how pleased I am with this product. I think this is the first real step  in consumer digital cameras that will rival any 35mm out there.  To date I  have been printing them on my HpR80 office jet (an ink jet) w/ suprisingly  good results. My next purchace will be a dedicated dye sub photo printer.  But the inkjet does a great job. Viewing the photos on the computer screen  or on a big screen TV is a blast.<br />Go digital, it is the way to go... it  really is quite good now and reasonably priced.<br />Good luck to you. Jim","Crisp and high resolution, pocket size, very convenient for A/V hook up to TV and Computer. very good bright resolution at night.little expensive then other competitors. IT'S WORTH MONEY THAT SPEND.","It's hard to imagine that such a tiny little camera can take brilliant 2400 by 1800 full color digital images, yet it does so extremely well!<br />I bought my Fujifilm FinePix 4700 mostly for my impending baby.  As a simple,  point-and-shoot digital camera, it fits the bill perfectly.  A fully  automatic mode with a preview screen lets you compose great-looking shots  quickly.  Despite the camera's size, its zoom lens pops out to a 108mm (3x)  view.  (And you can digital zoom at lower resolutions.)  There's even a  popup flash on top.<br />If you want a more controlled shot than the fully  automatic mode or the preprogrammed portrait, night scene, or scenery  modes, you can go to a fully manual mode, enabling you to adjust ISO  \"film\" sensitivity, metering, exposure value, white balance,  macro mode, and even manual focus.<br />Depending on how much memory you've  put in (it uses Compact Flash cards), you can even take a minute long or so  JPEG movie, complete with sound.  A tiny built-in speaker lets you watch  and hear the movie you just took on the camera itself.<br />By plugging a  computer's USB cable into the camera, you can transfer pictures and movies  out of it at high speed.  The camera includes Adobe PhotoDeluxe Home  edition for editing.  Or you can view your masterworks on a TV screen using  the A/V output port and cable that comes in the box.<br />What really  impresses me is how Fujifilm fit all these features into such a small  package.  The camera's light and fits into the palm of my hand just right.  Holding the camera takes a little getting used to, and you do have to be  careful not to cover the autofocus transducer-thingamajig.  But it's not  uncomfortable at all.<br />When turning the camera off, the lens retreats into  the body of the unit and a metal cover slides into place, protecting it  quite effectively.<br />The only major drawback is the battery usage.  It's  quite easy to burn through its two AA-sized rechargeable NiMH batteries  before you've even filled up a 32MB flash card.  Leaving the LCD display  screen off and using the viewfinder instead definitely helps prolong  battery life.  The box luckily includes four such batteries (plus a  charger), so you can carry a spare set with you, or recharge two batteries  while using the other two.<br />Overall, I'm blown away at how far  miniaturization technology has progressed.  The features and performance of  the camera are great---but to have all that in such a tiny box is  absolutely amazing.","I just opened the box this morning and by the afternoon, I was sending the pictures to my friends and family over the internet.  The camera is extremely easy to use, and so is the software program that comes with it.  The pictures are very clear and sharp, with this type of quality, who need  35mm cameras anymore?"]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 990","amazon_reviews":["Very happy with this camera","Camera arrived on time , and it is great, thanks.","I lost my previous Nikon Coolpix 990, which I purchased many years ago for $800, and wanted a high end replacement.

These batteries are not made by Nikon, of course. On the other hand, I don't know where to assign blame for the fact that the plugs between camera and battery cord and between cord and batteries tend to lose contact; I have to frequently twist then a bit to restore power, and of course the settings are lost and have to be re-made.  This has been true of three different cords and battery packs.<br /><br />All in all, though, I just *like* the E990.  It feels good, works well, gives excellent results.

This camera is very popular for this use as the quality of the macro photographs is excellent.  All of the positives and most of the negatives have already been stated about this camera.  I want to add an irritating design flaw that to my knowledge cannot be fixed.  After careful, but frequent use for 3 years, the plastic 'nub' that the battery compartment door latches to has first bent and then broken off.  The plastic piece is part of a large casting and cannot be replaced.  This has happened to 4 Nikon 990s used at our school.  I complained about this defect at a recent meeting and found that multiple colleagues at other institutions have experienced the identical defect.<br /><br />Using adhesive tape to wrap the battery compartment shut has offered a temporary solution, but this unit uses batteries too quickly for taping to be more than a temporary stop gap until we buy new cameras..<br /><br />Nikon 990s are still readily available on the web.  This design flaw limits very frequent use.","I've had mine for 3 years and it's just what I wanted for what I use it for. If anyone wants a great camera to use for just about any task or just fun?

On the other hand, I don't know where to assign blame for the fact that the plugs between camera and battery cord and between cord and batteries tend to lose contact; I have to frequently twist then a bit to restore power, and of course the settings are lost and have to be re-made.  This has been true of three different cords and battery packs.<br /><br />All in all, though, I just *like* the E990.  It feels good, works well, gives excellent results. I rather prefer it to my Nikon D70 (eye-level SLR with professional lenses), although each has its advantages and disadvantages - you need both, if you're serious.","As background, I (and 4 colleagues) use 2 of the Nikon 990s daily to take entire animal photos plus macro closeups at a Veterinary School.  This camera is very popular for this use as the quality of the macro photographs is excellent.  All of the positives and most of the negatives have already been stated about this camera.  I want to add an irritating design flaw that to my knowledge cannot be fixed.  After careful, but frequent use for 3 years, the plastic 'nub' that the battery compartment door latches to has first bent and then broken off.  The plastic piece is part of a large casting and cannot be replaced.  This has happened to 4 Nikon 990s used at our school.  I complained about this defect at a recent meeting and found that multiple colleagues at other institutions have experienced the identical defect.<br /><br />Using adhesive tape to wrap the battery compartment shut has offered a temporary solution, but this unit uses batteries too quickly for taping to be more than a temporary stop gap until we buy new cameras..<br /><br />Nikon 990s are still readily available on the web.  This design flaw limits very frequent use.","I've had mine for 3 years and it's just what I wanted for what I use it for. If anyone wants a great camera to use for just about any task or just fun? Buy it. Buy it now!","I picked up this camera used to do some assignment work for an online publication.  I specifically wanted full manual control and the ability to use an external flash (the internal flash is almost useless).<br />The large handgrip is a welcomed change from most other digicams out there.  It feels nice and solid in your hand while the no-slip surface does its job admirably.  The shutter release button is solid and the mode jog dial is placed perfectly.  The user interface could benefit from minor usability improvements, but for the most part is easy to use and learn in seconds without consulting the manual.  And to echo what everyone else mentions, battery life lasts me about 40 shots with the monitor and flash turned off.  I take along a spare set of AA batteries for short outings.  For longer outings, I mount a DigiPower DPS9000 external battery pack into the tripod mount<br />Overall picture quality is good, but not to the level of my 35mm film cameras under moderate scrutiny.  For web content, picture quality is awesome, though.  Resolution and sharpness are perfectly acceptable for 4x6 prints.  Nice to have the 3:2 ratio to let you print uncropped 4x6 images.  Macro capabilities are great.<br />Since I prefer to print my personal images, I feel the Coolpix's weakness is in its color reproduction.  Photos printed on a Fuji Frontier 370 system seem to lack a certain saturation or 'punch' in various colors - things seem to be on the dull or compressed side and not very vibrant, even if the original scene was.  This is especially noticeable when you hold a digital print next to a film print when both have used the same exposure and focal length and have been printed on the same machine.<br />Sure, I can spend time in PhotoShop adjusting curves and levels, but that's more time consuming than it's worth if you ask me.  For a few photos, no big deal.  But if I just shot 50+ images that are keepers, I'm not going to spend countless hours tweaking each one.<br />I found that a semi-decent shortcut is to get the ICC profile for my target printer and batch up all the images in PhotoShop to have the profile applied automatically.  I then spend $0.29/print at my local camera shop getting them printed.  Inexpensive, fast, sharp, and durable -there's no way I can print at home at that price or time savings, and I doubt anyone else can.<br />PROS:<br />Sharp images (provided you keep the sharpness setting on Auto)<br />Easy user interface<br />Inexpensive on the used market<br />Decent build quality<br />CONS:<br />Condensed color range<br />Slow to focus and fire shutter (2-3 sec.)<br />Supplied software is almost useless<br />Viewfinder shows too little of actual image (85%?)","Technology may have passed this camera by as you can buy a smaller 3+ megapixel camera for less money, but I've used this camera for 2 years with nary a problem.  You may be able to get a good deal on a used model.  I use it as camera that is shared by many departments where I work, so it gets heavy use.<br />The quality of photos taken in bright light on the \"fine\" setting is stunning and prints well as 8 x 10s (you can even get away with larger sizes, if you don't mind a little pixelation).  The camera's auotmatic mode is adequate for most shots, but you can adjust the shutter speed and other customizable features.  The pivoting lens body is also handy to get into tight spaces.  The LCD screen is bright, but can be hard to read outdoors.<br />Battery life is 40+ photos with rechargables.  I don't recommend using Alkalines with this camera, but they work in a pinch.<br />The biggest drawback with this camera is the flash.  The proximity of the lens to the flash means you'll be correcting lots of \"red eye\" on your PC or Mac.  The flash is also very weak in low to medium light situations, and you can't add an external flash to the camera.<br />This camera sometimes fails to start when turning it on, or shuts off after a few seconds on, but turning it off and on again seems to help.  I attribute these glitches to age and abuse due to heavy use rather than poor manufacturing.","This is a fantastic camera.  I routinely use the second or third highest resolution setting and I am able to take pictures that have excellent detail and color.  My preferences are close-up shots and panoramic views and this camera excels at both.  The 3.34 megapixels is more than sufficient to print off non-pixelated 8x10 photos from my Canon s900 photo printer (also very good).  I've used this camera at night to get some good city-scapes (especially considering that I don't have a tripod) and for shots ranging from dreary days in Ireland to sunny mornings in Santa Fe and the camera is great.<br />I picked the brains of camera-philes before purchasing my digicam and Nikon was repeatedly recommended as one of the best cameras in the price range, regardless of extra features (Sony) and higher pixel concentrations (Olympus, HP, Epson).  That advice proved correct.  If you can't find this model, look into the CoolPix 4500, which is essentially the 990's replacement.","Overall I love this camera and would recommend it, especially considering the price you can get one for now.<br />However, here are the cons:<br />1)  Red-eye problems.  Nearly every flash photo has red-eye.  I have read that this is because the flash is too close to the lense.  However, fixing red-eye on your computer is easy, so it's a tolerable defect.<br />2)  Although the camera body rotates, it's not quite as user-friendly as the flip screen that rotates in any direction on the Canon G-2.<br />3)  Resolution.  I always shoot on \"fine\", but still end up with some photos that I'm not crazy about the resolution.  Pictures with lots of detail turn out great, but where there is less detail, you end up seeing the little dots.  Although people say a 3.0 megapixel camera approaches film quality, I disagree. I see the pixelation even on 4X6 prints.<br />Conclusion:  I'll continue to use (and love) my Nikon 990 until I save enough to replace with a 4-5 megapixel camera like the Canon G-3 or Nikon 5000.","I purchased the 990 as soon as it hit the stores and on-line and have been using it eversince. I have taken pictures in the Lower 48,  Alaska, New Zealand, Australia, and Thailand in all kinds of tempertures and humidities and have had no problems what so ever!  I have even bounced it off the bottom of a boat with no damage thanks to its metal body.<br />So far I have taken almost 5,000 pictures and the only problem experienced was when I failed to remove the lense cover.<br />It excells at all distances from a flower at one inch to the moon. OUTSTANDING!!!","In daylight, you can get excellant quality photos, but in dim light, it is impossible to get sharp shots without a tripod.  Raising the ISO to anything over 100 will result in lots of ugly noise in the photo.  The built in flash is horrible.  It is good to use as a fill flash in outdoor shadows, but will give poor results as a stand alone flash indoors.  For good indoor shots, I have found the best results using a tripod and the \"slow sync\" flash mode. The shutter speed will be very slow, so any movement of the subject will result in blur.  Again, dim light is this camera's biggest fault.  It will ALWAYS set a SLOW shutter speed, making it impossible to hand hold the camera.  Manually setting a faster speed such as 1/30 will not work, because the camera cannot set a large enough f-stop to allow a proper exposure.  So, in the right conditions, the 990 can take perfect photos, but in night or indoor situations, you will have to really make some carefull settings and use a tripod to get good results.  The macro mode is FANTASTIC. It will take stunning close up shots. I really think that is this camera's greatest asset. The rotating head makes taking close ups in ackward positions a breeze.  Another couple negatives though, the monitor is impossible to see in bright sunlight, turn it off to save power and use the viewfinder.  This brings up the second negative, if you have an accessory lens attached to the head, it will block out your view through the viewfinder.  It looks like Nikon has addressed lots of these problems with the new Cool Pix 5700.  I suggest you spend just a little more money and get the 5700, (with lots more zoom and over 5 megapixels), instead of the 990 / 995.","This is good. I'd like for it to be used for productive religious activites. The digital photos I've take of dake-bonoist clicking sessions have warmed my heart.","I used this camera as part of my journalism class. The camera is an excellent value. The megapixels are enough for most applications, and the price is not large enough to break your pocket book. I am thinking about picking one up this year. For [the price], this camera is a steal. The only thing that I wish this had which only the top end SLR cameras have, are interchangable lenses. But for the average shooter, this is a great camera.","The Nikon 990 was my first digital camera, and after eighteen months of use, I don't regret my decision to pick it at all.<br />I chose it because of<br />its high pixel count (3.34 Mpixels, which make for large images that can print 8X10 and be indistinguishable from a 35mm print);<br />its multi-functionality (point and shoot automatic-everything, aperture preferred, shutter preferred, and even completely manual modes);<br />its popularity (which means that there're TONS of aftermarket lenses, etc. for it); and<br />its ease of use (I'm sold on the rotating body).<br />I've never regretted it.<br />There're warts to the 990, of course; no camera's perfect.  The built-in speedlight right next to the lens guarantees harsh lighting, big shadows, and red-eye (the 995 isn't much better); and the fact that a thousand-dollar camera doesn't come with a hot shoe is scandalous.<br />But the options are there, not only from Nikon but places like EagleEye; and the number of CoolPix 990 user groups on the Internet guarantee a large group of friends you can call on for help.<br />Once you get through the menu learning curve, the ease of use and quality of the image simply can't be beat.  I simply can't imagine a better camera for the money.","I was hesitatant about buying a digital camera, especially at the price. But after seeing many web sites with images from the camera, I took the plunge.<br />Shooting digitally is a bit different from traditional photography. I tend to use the LCD screen to set up shots, and you can't really fire shots off as quickly with a digital camera, it has to autofocus, etc.<br />But, I, and others who've seen my photos, love the quality. I print them out on a HP Deskject 1220, which when using photo quality paper makes brilliant prints.<br />I took this camera to France. I shot over 1,500 images. I took 4 flash cards with me, since I had no way to upload the images while I was there. The images I got from that trip were worth the price of the camera alone. I now have a bound book of images I printed on my HP.<br />There will always be arguments over film and digital cameras. I own both. I love each for what they can do.<br />The Nikon CP990 delivers great quality, a lot of flexibility in use, which takes some time to learn. You can shoot macro, adjust contrast, adjust the EV value, shoot in black and white and even capture 30 seconds of video.<br />I bought the Nikon wide angle 28 lens. The standard lens just doesn't capture as much as I liked.<br />All in all, this has been a great tool to have. I shoot almost daily with it.<br />If you want a digital camera and intend to use it heavily, then go for it. You won't be disappointed.","I love this camera, still!!! When I first bought it the battery life and red eye were the two biggest features I knew I would struggle with. As it turns out, the new Duracell M3 technology batteries are really great and have even replaced my rechargeables, as they last longer.  So really, I think with these new batteries, one problem is solved (for me). ----Note, I bought the Unity Pro 5 battery pack which lasted about six months...also a good idea, but it tends to overcharge and  initially you have to drain some power off the battery----<br />As for the redeye, I have a pretty simple photo editing program for this and it is a hassle , but a workeable one. I could spend the extra 200-300 for an external flash, but so far it hasn't happened.<br />Bottom line---this camera takes amazing pictures, particularly in natural light. You pay a little more for it but, then again it is a NIKON.","I have a 950, a 990 and a 995. They are all great cameras. The 995 has a 4:1 zoom, and a few other improvements, but this one is a bit smaller - I like it as well. You have more control with these Nikons than any other. And the swivel design makes it possible to take shots in situations you couldn't with any other camera, even IMHO the newer LCD designs like the CP5000 or Canons. This is a great camera, it takes great pictures, and the accessory lenses make it an excellent system.","It's a Great Camera<br />But it have two problems<br />1-Don't work well with low light<br />2-The driver fails with Windows 2000","This thing is well above being a toy, and I love it after a year. The only problem is the red eye, because this thing's flash doesn't do much to prevent it. It looks like they corrected it with the 995 though, as it has a pop-up flash much like those on most SLR's.","I purchased the coolpix 990 because I was starting to get into photography. I was a beginner in every sense of the word. The 990 is packed full of features that can be overwelhming. It took me awhile to learn everything, but it was worth it. The only suggestion that I would make is to purchase an external flash. The one that is on the camera tends to promote red-eye. Other than that this is a winner.","I reviewed this camera a year ago, a few weeks after I got it. I still give it 4 stars, though my reasons are a little different.<br />What's good about it: The photos. The quality is amazing. Combined with my Epson photo printer, I get stunning results. Far better than going to a photo lab. The cost. Yes, the camera and accessories are initially expensive to buy, but (as I predicted) I have saved a small fortune in film and developing costs. Ease of use. This camera is as easy to use as you want it to be. There are lots of options, but I find I take most photos using the automatic settings. Also, it's small enough to just throw in a bag without the need for extra lenses, etc. I bought a telephoto lens, but find I rarely use it.<br />The main problem is batteries. The camera devours batteries like you wouldn't believe. Be prepared to either spend a small fortune on them (and get weighed down carrying around lots of them), or to buy several sets of rechargeables.<br />Other things to think about: Last time I complained that adding lenses disabled the flash. While this is still true, I have found it not to be as big a problem as I expected. There are many occasions when I might have used a flash with a 35mm camera but don't need it with this one. It is still a problem in many indoor situations, however. Getting the photos into a computer can also be a problem. I have no problems with my laptop, the enclosed usb cable/software works very well. On a recent trip I had to use my husband's laptop instead and couldn't get the software to run properly, despite it supposedly being compatible with Windows 2000. I bought a cheap card reader and this solved the problem. All in all, I am extremely happy with the camera and still recommend it. I haven't used my 35mm camera in over a year, which goes to show just how much I prefer the Coolpix 990.","Kudos to Nikon regarding this camera, I've owned it for about a year now and it's one of the best investments I've made!  It's flexible, automatic or manual operation and the quality is approching top end 35mm boxes (I've used a Canon SLX for about 30 years) for the majority of one's use. The 3.+MP is the key when shooting images for 8x10 displays. It is necessary to upgrade the memory amount to a minimum of 64MB(~ [$]) and use the 1,500mahr batteries w/ a charger, a set of 4 batteries will cost about [$](with charger, about [$]).  I shoot in 35mm mode at high resolution and get about 5-6 hours of battery life & ~ 60 images per 64MB of RAM & use the USB download to my laptop.  If most of your work is indoors, get the optional AC adapter ~ [$] I have 2 other digcams, the image quality of those are ok for small displayed images up to about 4 x 5's, but the 990 is top shelf for the price!  In summary, I don't leave home without it!","This camera is great.  For those of you who are new to photography, it operates as a point-and-shoot.  If you are looking to advance your skills, it offers manual ability (apeture, shutter speed and focus).  This camera has all the features of a Nikon SLR.  This camera takes sharp and clear pictures, and is definately worth the price!<br />The only downfall to the camera is that is is prone for causing redeye due the close proximity of the lens and the flash.  Nikon just introduced the Nikon Coolpix 995 that is essentialy the same as the 990 but with a pop-up flash.  That should eliminate the red eye.<br />I would expect the 995 to drive down the price of the 990.  If the price between the two camerasis incidental, go for the pop-up flash to elimate the red eye.  If the price difference is alot, stick with the 990 - you won't be disappointed, and editing software makes it super easy to remove redeye.<br />I upload my images to photoworks.com.  Their software allow you to edit the picture before you send it - their red eye reduction is a snap.  The quality of the pictures is tremendous - noone ever knows the image is digital!<br />Good luck with the camera - you are guarenteed to love it!","If you decide to purchase this camera, understand that you are not selecting a point-and-shoot digital camera.  This compact camera is a full featured package designed with the 35 mm photographer in mind.<br />It comes with a complete set of controls -- everything from  fully automated exposure to manual control, autofocus and accessory lens.  As a result it reacts to your needs and requirements in much the same way as a Nikon 35mm SLR would.  Therein lies the rub; to fully exploit the 990's features and capabilities, you have to work with it.  The more you use it, the more you will like it.","I am a plastic surgery resident in the United Kingdom.  I use the Nikon coolpix 990 nearly every day of my working week.  There are several features that make this product particularly good.  The macro facility allows me to take pictures of small features (e.g. fingertips and even down the operating microscope) in enormous detail.  The large buffer means that there is no delay between pressing the shutter release and acquiring a picture. The colour reproduction is excellent and (importantly) very realistic. Battery consumption is also good when using Ni-metal hydride batteries.  I need a change of batteries every 10-14 days despite daily use (20-40 Mb of photographs at basic resolution) with the flash on for nearly all pictures.  The only drawback is the built-in flash which works under most circumstances but may occasionally pose a problem when taking pictures at short range because of the asymmetric position. Overall, the camera is so good that it has rapidly become the 'standard' issue for nearly all plastic surgery residents in London.","It is very nice. i use it for southern university web pag photos. It did take a while to figure out some of the functions and to be honest i still have not got it all. Takes real nice pictures except when i use the zoom feature w/o tripod.  I wish battery life was longer, but i usaly have two hours of true battery life. But the biggest problem is telling other faculty members \" not a loaner camera...that would be the other brand.\"","The Nikon Coolpix 990 represents the point-and-shoot digital technology ALMOST mature. The shutter delay is hardly noticeable, and most images get written to the drive fairly quickly. Batteries almost last a reasonable amount of time. However, the Quicktime movie capability is a little awkward -- no sound -- and the color of the images seems to always be a problem.<br />However, if you're looking to buy a digital point-and-shoot today, this is the camera to buy. The independent, rotational-lens design is brilliant. You can point the thing at yourself and view your self-portrait as you take it, which by itself makes this camera  a standout in my book. Add to that the top-quality optics and dazzling array of features, and this model is the one to beat.<br />Given all that, for the time being I'll stick to my (film-based) Olympus Stylus Epic for most of my shooting on-the-go. The Nikon is too big, too slow, too energy-hungry, and waaay too expensive to go everywhere the way the Olympus does.","One area that the 990 excels over most digital cameras is the ability to control the shutter speed and aperture. This gives you much greater control over the composition and quality of your images.<br />Most digital cameras give you no control over depth of field. With the 990, setting the aperture is simple and gives you control over this important quality of your photographs. Control over shutter speed allows you to freeze action or blur motion, again giving you creative control over your subject.<br />Combined with the high quality of the images the camera produces, these features have won my loyality to the Nikon digital line.","I am a camera assistant in the motion picture business.  I'd like to think that I understand photography better than most folks.  When I first bought the camera I had a bit of buyers remorse.  I'll admit it was a bit expensive toy purchase for me.  After using it for 3 mos I am blown away with the images I capture. I've taken pictures with it that have been published.  I would repeat the purchase in an instant.  Everyone writes the same stuff in their reviews so this is about what to get and not get with the camera.<br />This camera has a lot of features and the documentation is just OK so get the Nikon Digital Photography book.  You may actually understand what you are doing then.  GET 2 sets of NiMH rechargable Batteries!  This camera eats regular batteries for lunch.  The NiMH batteries last longer than regular batteries. Get a bigger memory card. 80M will give you about 100 pictures in medium resolution.  Get a fast card 8X or better. Don't be cheap here.  The faster cards will cut down your cycle time between photos.  Something to think about as you are missing shots waiting for the camera to load the image you shot. In theory these things last forever, so buy the best. Get a card reader with your camera.  It will dowmload in a fraction of the time camera direct will download. Get the 24mm wide angle adapter lens.  I promise you will love it and use it all the time. I have two cases for my camera.  One that holds just the camera and my 24mm lens. I take it with me when I want to grab some quick shots.  The other case holds my battery charger and other lenses in addition to the camera.  It's overkill but it works for me.  Whatever you do PROTECT your camera! I don't think I'd buy the 3X extender again.  I don't use it that often and it was expensive.  \"Wider is better\" If you are in low light you will want to get a tripod and have your subject stand still.  If you can manage that you can get shots with hardly any light. Good luck and enjoy your camera!","This camera takes awesome pictures.  My wife and I debated a long time what kind of camera to get, a regular nikon or a digital one. We decided on the digital because we liked the idea of printing photos at home, and sharing photos with family on the internet. And with a relatively inexpensive photoprinter (HP Photosmart P1000) we print photos as good as I've ever gotten back from dropping them off to be developed.<br />Also, with a little photo-editing you can turn almost any picture into a winner.  This lets you to turn pictures that would otherwise end up at the bottom of a shoebox, into family treasures.<br />We have two children and this camera has allowed us to produce the best pictures we have ever taken of our children.","This great system of imaging has revitalized my photojournalism, providing immediate feedback, color temprature balancing, low light photography, supurb detail with the fisheye and long telephoto, great closeup work. You simply must buy another harddisk with this camera. very controlable, you should spend time with the well written manual. Software upgrade of camera firmware downloaded over the internet from Nikon improved operations. Still a bit slow to record images, but a fabulous tool, extension of the eye. Camera has more ram than my computer! Using photoshop vastly improves the images, better environmentally than using the old chemical systems.","Having been a Nikon user for 95% of my photographic career, the 990 was a natural purchase.  This is a wonderful camera in every fashion!  It's made in true Nikon tradition--durable, dependable, and simple to use.  Does it do what my D1 will do--no it won't, but it wasn't intended to.  However, it does share many similar functions to the D1 or a well-equiped SLR.  You have the option of aperture or shutter speed priority, program (and program shift), as well as full manual control.  And if you use the LCD panel for viewing, you do have a digital SLR of sorts, so you can use filters (such as a polarizer) and others.  So you do have a very capable and creative tool with this camera.  My main purpose for buying this camera was to have a digital \"point-and -shoot\" that wasn't as cumbersome as the D1 or an SLR and didn't require carrying around an array of lenses but still gave me some of the SLR tools that would be useful.  In other words, this camera allows me to do digital imaging and keep it simple.<br />My only bone of contention with the 990 is the flash.  Expect to remove red-eye from 90 percent of your people-pictures.  And the red-eye reduction feature doesn't help much.  The flash is just too close to the lens--period!  I bought the flash bracket so I can use my Nikon SB-28 flash and that proved to be a flawless combination.  The only problem with that arrangement is that it sort of defeats the point-and-shoot purpose to a small extent.  The only other issue would be seeing the LCD panel in bright light outdoors, but I imagine that's probably a typical problem with most of these cameras.  But here's a little tip.  Take a piece of black posterboard, fashion it into a square tube the size of the LCD panel, put some narrow strips of velcro on it and around the LCD panel and voila--a viewing hood that works like a charm!  Also, as is probably also typical for these cameras, don't expect long battery life if you use the LCD panel all the time.  Get some rechargeable metal hydroxide batteries.  The life span is far, far longer.  The Everyready system works very well.  Aside from that, for general shooting outdoors and indoors, I love this camera.<br />I have to be honest and state that I didn't do a lot of comparing.  I had (and still have) the Coolpix 800 and loved it as well, and again, being a Nikon freak, there wasn't any indecision here.  I simply wanted a \"point-and-shoot\" digital that had more capabilities than the 800 had.  If I'm doing some really serious shooting for publication or exibition, then it's time for the D1 or the old faithful SLR and slide film.<br />Don't think twice if you're considering this camera.  It's top-notch all the way!","This camera is great! I've done professional photography for a number of years and am very impressed by the results of the 990. Image quality is outstanding. The camera is easy to use. My only complaint is the software included with the 990. It wouldn't recognize the camera on my usb port, no matter what I did. I tried it on 3 different computers, and had the same problem with Windows 95, 98 and ME. I downloaded all the stuff from the web, and finally after many frustrating hours got the images transferred to the computer. Now, it works like a breeze. The red-eye is a problem, as everyone has mentioned before. But, I knew that when I bought the camera, and use it mostly for product, tabletop work. I give it 4 stars only because of the software problems and red-eye...minor problems that can be solved one way or another....END","I love this camera.  It take great pictures and has many features that allow you to contorl it like a normal SLR camera.  The one flaw that this camera has it that suffers from \"red eyes\" quite a bit.  The red eye reduction feature only seems to make it worse.","I took 4,500 pictures (so far)in 4 months and the Coolpix 990 is still going strong. This is a general follow-up on my two earlier reviews, Sept 26, 00 CJ, and Oct 22,00 CJinPa. I'm updating this review because of the enjoyment I get from this camera and all the support I recieved from other \"posters\" as I researched prior to my purchase. If you consider this product, you'll LOVE your purchase.<br />I snapped a lot of pics with this thing and print out the good shots on my printer for framing. Believe me, I've taken lots of shots, but only a few \"really good\" ones. BUT, my technique gets better all the time. This \"learning curve\" would of sent me to the poor house if I used my 35mm Nikon and had to develop all those rolls of film.  Digital is \"free\" after you make your initial investment in the gear.  I bought a pile of add-on lenses and flash assys. for the camera to get the most out of it.<br />There is a great E-Book by Peter iNova \"Mastering Nikon Digital Cameras\" ($50)that is a detailed 990 camera; instruction manual - photo techniques - editing & printing tutorial that is the PERFECT companion to your 990 purchase. The E-Book is interactive and will help you MASTER the 990 to its potential. Get this if you get the camera, i believe this is a MANDATORY purchase. If this was out when I bought the camera, I'd of saved 3 months off my learning curve.<br />Well, not many more good things to say that haven't been said before. Excellent quality pictures, great quality camera, and ample support from Nikon (if ever needed). This camera is a great buy that will leave you happy with your investment 4,500 pictures later. Enjoy your new purchase.","overall i've been pleased with the 990, the only drawbacks are<br />(1) disappointed in the manufacturers claims about standard AA battery life, usually 15mins is average, not the hour and half claimed. NiMHs are a must, I use 1600maH which usually lasts 12 hours at least. Get real nikon, ship at least nicads, sure its a cost issue, but its very environmentally wasteful and poor customer relations to ship batteries that last for 15 mins or less. (2) The manual is weak, but is typical of translated manuals. 3) accessories are hard to get hold of, and the remote release is expensive (although its feature loaded) an IR or RF based remote would be nice, most other camera makers offer them. (4) suffers from red eye a lot. (5) low quality software on the PC, even lower on the MAC, crashes often on win2k, even after the update to camera firmware and PC software, crashes on first time use everytime. (6) menu access is slow, camera could do with a faster cpu, latest software release helps things somewhat but it could be better. (7) one very small thing that would only affect a few people, is the inbuilt IR filter for the lens, which means you can't do the near IR style photography thats popular with other digicams.<br />other than those small quibbles, its generally an excellent camera, its a lot of fun to use.  Once you are setup with NiMHs and a decent sized CF card its easy sailing, we've had it for about two months and are still finding new things about it. Pictures taken are great, the jpg compression levels work well,the low is very low quality suitable for web pictures, but the high end is good, and the highest setting, with no compression is excellent.","We are using the 990 in a manufacturing setting with great results. We are able to go down to nearly two centimeters on objects that we used to pay $200-$300 for pics from the net. This camera is simply amazing. In addition, new software that can be downloaded into the camera itself makes the manual settings even better. I have been a 35mm film guy for over 15 years. This camera, the 990, has changed all of that. I think the 990 has put us on the threshold of a new era of photography. Throw on the extra lenses and this camera can do almost anything. I recommend it highly. We are using photos for a small trade magazine and even some trade show graphics. While you are unable to produce the much larger scale graphics, this little camera is simply out of this world.","I bought from Amazon.com and it has paid for itself many times over.  I have made over 6,000 photographs with it.  I carry plenty of battery and memory (two sets of NiMH AA batteries and a Digipower battery pack), two 32 mb, one 64 mb, and one 80 mb memory card.  ON a shooting trip I take about 400 pictures or more per day.  Quality is excellent; I have made full page, full bleed color brochures with it.  Most of the time I use XGA mode, high quality compression, 400 kilobyte per picture.  For pro work I use full size high quality, but still JPEG, 1 megabyte per picture.  It is exceptionally well suited to smoothly textured subjects (sky, water, glass) where the lack of grain is paramount.  It is somewhat less suited to intricate subjects (forest).  The swivel LCD screen makes formerly difficult shots easy (low or high viewing angles).  Macro focus is excellent.  Color balance and exposure control very good; you will want to edit most of your shots in a good bitmap editor (Corel Photopaint for instance) to rotate upright and equalize color.  You can also apply a \"film-like\" s-curve adjustment to make it look just like film if you wish.","I recently returned a Sony F505v because the pictures looked washed out by background colors.  I have had the 990 for 2 days now and can tell you the colors are simply vibrant.  The focusing is better, and when set on \"A\" the camera does everything itself and the pics are wonderful. I haven't been able to figure out if the movies can be recorded with sound so if anyone knows how to get noise with the movie files I would appreciate it.  Other than the lack of sound, the batteries are a bit more of a hassle than the ones that went into the Sony because it came with a Lithium Ion powerpack.  I purchase Nickel Metal rechargables and expect that it will be ok.<br />Please tell me how to turn on the sound somebody!","While I have followed the emergence of digital cameras with interest over the last few years, I have to admit that one concern/requirement ultimately convinced me that the purchase of a digital camera made sense:  the availability of 3 MegaPixel resolution cameras. The resolution of pictures taken with a Nikon Coolpix 990 is indeed extremely high.  This camera has three \"resolution levels.\"  I usually use the middle level: the \"Normal\" mode.  The resolution of pictures taken in this mode is very, very good.  I would not hesitate to make 8\" by 6\" prints of such pictures.  Rarely do I use the \"Fine\" mode (there is really no reason to use it in my view). In the \"Normal\" mode, I believe that I get about 20-25 pictures on my memory card.  For my purposes that is adequate. Of course, my initial approach has proven too simplistic:  there are other factors (other than resolution alone) that you should consider before buying a digital camera! If are thinking of buying a digital camera to photograph subjects that move quickly and erratically (such as a young child), you will soon realize that taking digital pictures is not ideal.  While I understand that the Nikon is relatively quick compared to other digital cameras, it still takes a fraction of a second to actually \"take\" the picture after pressing the button.  So you end up with a lot failed pictures that would have been great if taken with a conventional camera.  The menu (for deleting pictures and other functions) is very intuitive and I believe it allows even those of us who don't read the owners manual cover-to-cover (like me) to get a lot out of the camera. I have one problem with the camera that is of a more serious nature:  often I take a picture that will cause the camera to \"crash\" when downloaded or viewed on the display (I often use the useful \"slide show\" feature).  It generates an error message and so far hasn't affected the other pictures on the memory card (but I have not been able to recover the subject picture).  I don't know if this is a problem with the memory card or with the camera - but it is annoying.  Without this problem, I would have given this camera a 5 star rating... I like the ergonomics of this camera and it feels like it's solidly constructed.  Rechargeable batteries (AA) are the way to go (they last surprisingly long).  Knowing this camera's features and limitations, I would still buy this camera again...","I have had this camera for 6 months, and I must say, it has changed the way I think about digital cameras.  I have used nothing but 35mm until now. The download to the computer is fast and easy, but you have to have Windows 98 or newer (to support USB).  -image manipulation in anything but HI (TIFF format) will cause moderate to severe resolution reduction -flash is mediocre YOU WILL NEED: a rechargeable battery kit with 4 AA's, and a bigger memeory chip (64mb is more than adequate for my needs). Hey- no one said this hobby was cheap!","I bought this camera six months ago and love it . I use sand-disk to transfer to my computer, it prints out 22x28 pictures with no adjustments using epson 9000 printer. note--you need 600 ram on your computer.","Keep plenty of batteries around. This camera uses a lot of them!","I too love my 990.  I bought it to replace my 950 which was a wonderful camera.  I agree with others that the 990's menu system takes some time to master if you really want to maximize the potential of this camera.  You can use the auto mode to take great pictures right out of the box though.  This camera, just like the 950 is a hog for batteries.  I like the fact that I can carry regular AA batteries as an emergency backup, but better yet, get two sets of rechargeables.  I use the camera to take \"crude\" pictures of radiographs and intraoperative pictures. The ability to select for light source makes this much easier.  It does a very good job for the radiographs and takes excellent surgical pictures (great color accuracy).  The flash unit is fairly weak so consider trying to get the elusive external flash adapter (hard to find in stock).  That's my only complaint with these Nikon digital cameras.  The accessories are sometimes very hard to get.","The camera is a wonder!  Unfortunately the instruction manual was recently translated from the original Japanese and is a mess. Nikon really needs to get a real pro tech writer to do justice to this fine piece of equipment.  The instructions regarding PC set-up are non-existent.  There may be a quick and easy way to get all the pictures transferred from the camera to the PC, but if there is it is not mentioned anywhere in either the manual or the accompanying CD. I'm sure I'll be able to work out how to do things, over time, but it would be so much more satisfying not to have to fight the translation. Don Nolen","The Nikon Coolpix 990 has been a great camera-I'm extremely pleased with it.  This is a good choice for an experienced or ambitious amateur photographer.  Most of my previous experience has been with a Panasonic that cost a little over half what this one did.  In comparison to that camera, the Nikon has better color saturation, is quicker at the draw, and of course has more features....  I've been very pleased with the way that the 990 allows control over both shutter speed and aperture, color balance, focus and metering points and several more obscure settings.<br />All digital cameras are battery pigs, and this is no exception.  A good  optical viewfinder (including support for zoom) is important in a camera like this for two reasons.  First, the color screen is useless in bright sunlight, but second, it provides you with a battery-saving option of turning off the monitor.  An LCD screen on top of the camera provides a readout on the most common settings (aperture, shutter speed, resolution & quality, storage, 'ISO', flash settings, manual focus distance).  Japanese electronics tend to have lots of features, reached through obscure combinations of buttons.  While I would hardly categorize this camera as being 'completely intuitive,' most of the functions are pretty easy to operate.  The more advanced settings are reached through a tabbed menu on the monitor, which is reasonably easy to use.  I've also found that the monitor is very accurate in both brightness and tone.  The monitor has several different modes-if you leave it turned on, the default mode is to superimpose some of the most-used camera settings over the picture.  This is similar to but not a complete duplicate of the readout on the top LCD screen.  You can also leave the menu on, superimposing it over the image.  While this covers part of the image, it also makes menu options available for immediate use.  Unless you are in very bright light, what you see on the monitor after taking a picture is what you get-I've never been disappointed that a picture didn't turn out like it appeared on the monitor (brightness and hue are adjustable).  Although the monitor is small, the view feature lets you zoom in and scroll around on stored images so that you can look at them more closely.<br />The configuration of the camera is unusual, splitting the viewfinder, lens and flash from the other half of the camera and allowing their separate rotation.  I usually don't rotate the lens, but sometimes it is convenient to do so, allowing you to take pictures over your head or around corners.  I bought a small minipod and found that the rotating lens assembly provides some extra flexibility when clamping the camera to whatever happens to be available.  The on-board flash is OK, but the red-eye reduction facility doesn't work very well.  If you don't use an off-camera flash, you're living with substandard lighting anyway, but there are more effective red-eye reduction systems on other built-in flashes.<br />It doesn't matter how slick the controls are, or how good it looks if it doesn't take acceptable pictures.  I've been quite please with the camera's performance in many different light conditions.  I've had fun capturing the Christmas lights in Zürich, and my best picture was a misty Fall scene on Mt. Pilatus with yellow and red leaves.  It took me 6 tries to get the exposure right (that's why you buy a camera like this), but it perfectly captured that dreamy backlit scene and its Autumn colors.  Pictures don't always come out as rich as negative film, but they aren't bad and when they are good, they can be very good.<br />I've found that close-ups work well, and macro mode is fun.  I've even used my 990 to copy signs or even pages in a book.  It is a quick way to capture text that you need to refer to later.  After you've taken a picture of a diagram or text, view it and use the zoom function to make sure that what you've just taken is legible in the monitor.<br />The camera has more continuous shooting options than I know what to do with.  The multi-shot 16 feature lets you create a single collage that consists of 16 pictures.  That's the kind of gimmick that you can't use very often without wearing out your audience's patience.  If you want to create a short movie, though, you can do that too.<br />Speaking of night pictures, I had a terrible time figuring out the self-timer.  When you put it in self-timer mode, the close-up icon (flower) comes on, and so does the red eye icon.  It turns out that you are stuck with this configuration, which isn't really optimal for night scenes. ...  Given the availability of multi-second shutter speeds, and a sensitivity adjustment providing an effective speed of ISO 400, some owners will undoubtedly pay for the MC-EU1 release, and the bulb setting is pretty much useless without it.<br />I like the USB cable.  Once you've loaded Nikon View on your computer, connecting the camera to a USB port and turning it on automatically makes the camera accessible as if it were a removable drive.  I've been traveling with just the USB cable and find it a very convenient way to pull pictures into my laptop and delete them from the memory card.  Connection of the USB cable automatically turns off the color monitor, and subsequent battery drain seems to be low.<br />...  I think most Nikon owners would appreciate a more advanced text than this, but it is comprehensive and has helped me better utilize my camera.<br />In summary, automatic operation is very good, and if desired, this camera offers the ability to control every aspect of the photography process.  It has less waiting time than many other digital cameras I've used, it is relatively easy to use, and it takes good pictures.  It's a winner!","Keeping this short and sweet (well shorter than most I hope), I just wanted to share with any person interested in this camera some valuable information to consider while shopping for a digital camera. About 4-5 months ago I gave my Nikon 950 to my better half itching to jump on the 3.3 Mp bandwagon. Right off the bat there were only 2 cameras to consider (the Sony DSC-S70 and the Nikon 990), all other 3.3's were just not up to par with these two. After a month of research I decided that the S70 would be the better of the 2 because of the sleek point and click design and sony's proprietary memory stick. Both camera's are true 3 megapixel cameras unlike the predecessor DSC-505V, both cameras have viewfinders (a must-have for day photography), and both cameras deliver exceptional pictures. But with the far stylish look of the S70 at $200 less the S70 was my choice at the time. I then spent the next 2 months trying to locate the camera in stock and at a good price, fortunately Amazon began to sell DCs which allowed me to start pricing cameras again. However, the Sonys were all backordered, which ended up to be a blessing in disguise. A few weeks later a relative purchased the 990 and allowed me to tinker with it. Still a believer on the S70 I was reluctant in accepting the bulkier design of the camera, but after a few hours I found the 990 to be the true champ of the 3.3's. During my tinkering I found a couple facts to consider for both cameras:<br /> 1. Both cameras come with an inadequate amount of storage, so getting extra memory is a MUST.<br /> 2. 1 battery (or 4 for the Nikon) will not do the job while you are on a trip.<br /> 3. Zoom on both are extremely low, so they will never truly replace a 35mm.<br /><br /> Taking those into consideration along with the offer Amazon had on the 990, it was hands down the better of the two for these reasons:<br /> 1. The 990 uses CF cards which are a standard in several cameras unlike the proprietary Memory Stick, also you get 16mb with the 990 compared to the 8mb with the S70.<br /> 2. A 64mb stick costs as much as a 96mb CF card.<br /> 3. The S70's memory write times were significantly slower than the 990 (due to the memory stick again).<br /> 4. The 990 uses AA batts which can be found anywhere.<br /> 5. The Manual Options for the 990 gives the photographer so much control over their photo conditions.<br /> 6. The 990s swivel design is fabulous, something totally impossible on the S70 unless your workaround happens to be your \"swivel-neck\".<br /><br /> Now does this make the 990 a great point&click? Probably not (dont get me wrong, the 990 is an unbelievable on its \"Auto\" mode) you will thoroughly enjoy the camera more because of the configurable nature of the camera, if you plan to truly take digital photography seriously then this is your camera. Also, a few quirks you need to adjust to with the camera (all DCs have them, but these I found were actually minor since you can find workarounds for them):<br /> 1. Batteries, the 990 inhales them... get a set of at least 4 to a recommended 8 rechargables, they cost a lot, but you will need them, the NiMH rechargers work great.<br /> 2. Get at least 32-64mb of memory, 16mb = 1 picture at the 990's absolute highest setting.<br /> 3. Upgrade the firmware to 1.1 when you get the chance, the autofocus upgrade is noticable.. quite noticable.<br /> 4. The software with the camera is weak, very weak (basic app to download pictures), get a picture editing package.<br /> 5. Built-in flash not the best for distant shots, which can be compensated with an external flash.<br /> 6. Red-eye is there and red-eye suppression doesn't do the trick most of the time, but get a red-eye removing pen at your local camera shop, they work wonders.<br /><br /> Like I said, every camera has quirks, but if I listed the quirks I discovered about the S70, I would never end this review. Finally, I assume that you can guess which camera I finally purchased off Amazon. I've been messing with it for this past week and I am now a Nikon believer (was one with the 950, but more so with this camera). I'm so eager to take pictures with it these holidays and hope that if you purchased the 990, that you find what I wrote true to your experiences as well. To those who are considering, I hope you find what I wrote informational. Merry Christmas everyone!! :)","This camera can focus to 2 cm. I've taken some incredible pictures of mushrooms with the macro setting and they are incredible. Definitly worth all the money I paid for it!","I started researching digital cameras nearly a year ago, as I had decided a while back that I wanted a digital camera. As an amateur photographer, I was looking for something reliable that produced excellent photographs. There were a plethora of websites containing opinions on which camera to purchase; I even took a few ¡§compatibility¡¨ tests, and most of the results named the Nikon Coolpix 990 as my best bet. After asking others for their opinions, I received an overwhelmingly positive response to this camera. There were  a few people who deemed the Coolpix 990 too pricey and convoluted, and I did consider getting some other less expensive cameras (like Fuji and Kodak), but my propensity for top-of-the-line items ultimately won. I purchased the 990 here on Amazon, and it arrived in a couple of days (thanks for the speedy service, Amazon!). There were several fears, however. A few people have said that such a high-end camera was not exactly necessary, that a cheaper camera would do the job. Initially, I had only planned to use this camera to post photos on websites, but I then realised that if I¡¦m going to spend a few hundred dollars on a big toy, I might as well have it do everything (namely 8 x 10 prints).<br />Having just returned from a short vacation in London, England, I can now accurately attest to the 990¡¦s excellence. I took this camera everywhere, and I soon abandoned my camera bag and I hung it around my neck for easy access. The tube, Parliament, Tower Bridge, pubs, restaurants, streets, shopping centres....I went to many places and took several photographs along the way. Before this trip I had really only used this camera for a few photos around my town, but now that I¡¦d taken it on vacation, I have a more lucid perception. This camera is phenomenal, and although I cannot ramble on in technical terms, I can articulate the ease with which I took photos, the terrific quality of the prints, and the sheer professionalism of it. Some specific points:<br />* The LCD is nicely-sized and clear, although I would stock up on NiHM batteries. I played around with the menu settings for such a few minutes, and the batteries completely drained. During my trip I shut off the screen to conserve the batteries.<br />* The swivel lens is convenient and affords a lot of versatility. Some people consider it odd, but I thought it was a nice touch.<br />* 16 MB memory card included in the box. Instead of buying more cards, however, I purchased the IOMEGA Pocketzip (formerly Clik! Drive) in order to dump my photos onto it during my trip. Highly recommended procedure!<br />* Some red-eye when you use the flash, but I've stopped using it altogether, as I prefer the soft effect of photos without it.<br />In conclusion, I am extremely satisfied with this marvelous camera. I take it everywhere now, and I can¡¦t imagine being as happy with anything else (until the next model comes out, of course). Albeit expensive, it is worth every penny. The photographs are amazing, the settings numerous so that you can customize it to your needs, and the convenience priceless!","To make this plain and simple,with the Nikon 990 and the H/P Photosmart 1100 printer, your friends will think your a pro! Excellent photos and outstanding pictures..Thank you Nikon.","I owned this camera for about 4 months, and in the time took over 1000 photos with it (yeah, I know, too much free time!). I used the photos for on-screen presentations, as well as 8x10\" printouts. The camera takes just incredible photographs, with accurate colors, and very sharp definition. Here are some other points I saw:<br />* autofocus was fairly quick during the day, but can bog down and become very indecisive in low light<br />* flash: powerful, but nothing you do can get rid of red-eye in virtually any shot (red-eye reduction mode is useless)<br />* camera can store photos in separate folders, which is useful for multiple occasions<br />* no support for Microdrive is a fatal flaw<br />* metering system is extremely accurate; found virtually no need to use the spot meter<br />* macro ability is second to none<br />* for dentistry, takes wonderful intraoral photos, utilizing the chair light and the built-in flash; not terribly good, though, if you want to focus on ONE tooth, since the flash will wash things out. The resolution is good enough, though, that you can focus on a quadrant, take the shot, and crop it later.<br />Overall, found it to be the perfect camera, minus the red-eye problems and lack of microdrive support. So I sold it and bought a Canon Powershot G1 (review forthcoming)...","I am semi-retired, my background was commercial photography for about thirty years.  I now have a furniture store which both my wife and I own.  We also have a crew that builds custom furniture. For our web site we needed good photos.  We have designated an area in the store mainly for photography. We chose the Nikon 990 coolpix digital camera because of the 3.34 megapixels and the reputation of the Nikon name. We purchased the camera when it first became available,I have had it since sometime in July 2000.  It took me  several weeks to learn the camera.  The documentation is very difficult to follow.  However I feel that I know the camera well enough now to use it to its fullest extent, we are getting incredible results. The Express photo program that comes with the camera is very good. I am able to correct the flower pot shape from looking down on the subject and crop for the desired results. In one previous ratings red eye was mentioned, and I also found that no matter what you do you get some serious red eye problems. In another program (Adobi Photo Shop) I zoom in on an eye so that the eye fills the entire monitor screen then I take all the red squares and turn them into the color I want, with amazing results.  If anyone wants to know more detail of how I do it please feel free to email me.","Photo quality is remarkable, including excellent colors and detail. Of course these are the most important aspects of a digital camera. Aside from that, other nice tricks include being able to swivel the lens and take mpeg movies. Some complaints you should be aware of:<br />- Not having a case seems chintzy when you're paying over $800 for a camera. - Bad red-eye even with that mode turned on. Lens is probably too close to the flash on the body. - Settings are not for the amateur. You need to spend a lot of time with the manual before using the complicated menus. I've used the \"restore settings\" button more than once. Don't pay for settings you don't use! - Flash seems weak, or I haven't found the right exposure+flash balance for taking shots in imperfect light from more than 12 feet. - Get a large flash card or don't bother. With \"normal\" photos in 3.3 megapixel cameras weighing in at 750K+, you should have at least a 32MB card. Over 100MB cards are really where digicams come into their own. - Flash card readers are also nice. The Coolpix USB is fine, but if you have 50 pictures it can still take a while. (Have to download new software for Win2000, a little annoying.) - The mpeg movies it produces are 40-second silent films, no sound! (Unless I've really gotten screwed up by the settings...) - The AC adapter is definitely worth it if you use the camera frequently, and you will.","Wait...you STILL haven't purchased this camera!??!  What are you waiting for?  I bought the 990 when it first became available at Amazon.com back in July.  I've been using it for everything.  I take it on mountain bike rides, take it to the beach, use it for fast action sports, portraits, you name it.  I love taking movies with it, too.  They're very easy to load into Premiere to add special effects.  This camera has options and features designed to work in all environments.  Make sure you have V1.1 software, though.  With V1.0, I was DYING while waiting for the camera to store all the pictures I took while in continuous mode.  This is one of my favorite modes, especially with soccer games.  But, with V1.1, as soon as you let go of the shutter release, the camera is ready to take more pictures.  This fix makes the camera as near perfect as can be!<br />I purchased the 2X telephoto lens...OH MY GOODNESS.  This lens is incredible.  I think the pictures are even SHARPER with this lens on.  It amazes me.  The 3X telephoto lens is now available and I have no doubt that it will exceed my expectations.  I also purchased the remote shutter release which adds more features to the camera like time lapse photography!  Cool for sunsets/sunrises.  Also, if you think the swivel feature of this camera is going to cause problems...DON'T.  It's the neatest thing and one of the biggest reasons I decided on this camera over the Olympus.<br />Well, why haven't you clicked the \"Purchase Now\" button???  Hurry!","First off, let me say that this camera is incredible, and worth every penny.  I've owned mine for about a week, and I've taken some incredible photos that look like they came out of a magazine (and I'm an amateur at best).<br />Now, let's get realistic about the camera.  I want to provide enough factual information to allow people to make their decisions about whether or not this is the right camera for them.  TheCoolpix 990 has tons of great points.  Most notably, it's 3.34 megapixels (3.24 effective), and thus produces top-quality images with incredible sharpness.  Another thing that was had me sold was the fact that you can go into full manual mode with this camera.  You can choose either shutter priority, aperture priority, or full manual (including fully manual focus).  This aspect of the camera should appeal to the professional or \"artsy\" photographer who wishes to customize the camera to get the exact effect they want.<br />After you upgrade the firmware to v1.1, the speed of certain camera operations are a bit faster, but the camera is already originally very fast.  Reviewing photographs in \"Play\" mode is a breeze, and there's not much delay when paging through them.<br />Buy rechargeable NiMH (nickel metal hydride) batteries and a charger before your camera ships.  The alkaline batteries that ship with the camera will die within hours,guaranteed.  Also, grab the amazing Maha C204F charger.  It allows you to leave the charger plugged in with batteries in it indefinitely, without ruining the batteries at all.  The charger will save you several hundred dollars in batteries.<br />A few drawbacks about the 990 (yes, they do exist): BSS (best shot selection) feature is kind of weak.  It's supposed to let you take 10 shots and it chooses the best (\"the one with the most detail\" I believe the manual says, whatever that means).  On some occasions it has actually chosen blurry photos over the sharp ones.  I've no clue how this works, but Nikon needs to reevaluate this function.  And a warning: don't rely on this camera for good long-exposure shots.  Shutter times of 4 seconds and longer in a dark setting will sometimes show a lot of noise in the photograph.  This is a very noisy camera (audibly and graphically), so try to limit your exposure times.  Also, please note that you will NOT be able to access the \"info.txt\" file that people in other reviews have mentioned.  Yes, the camera saves all photo details (shutter speed, ISO, flash, aperture, etc.) to a file called \"info.txt\", but you CANNOT access the file unless you're using a card reader.  The NikonView software will only let you pull photos from the camera, nothing else.<br />I'll conclude this here because I could rant on for a while on other great points.  The camera is truly amazing, buy it now.  Yes, it has drawbacks, but no camera is perfect--and this one comes pretty close to perfection.  This camera is comparable to the Olympus C3030, so check that out as well.  The features of the C3030 are similar, and in some ways the camera is a little better (the movie mode actually records audio!), and a little worse (uses SmartMedia only).","I use this camera at work to produce newsletters and stuff. Previously I used film and scanned the photos; this makes an incredible difference to my productivity. And the results I get are much better than before.<br />No matter what I ask of this camera, it does the business, makes me feel like more of a pro than I am.<br />I love the ability to twist the lens and look down on the screen; all cameras should be like this.<br />You'll need to spend quite a bit of time getting used to the many different screens if you want to use anything other than auto. It's all a bit complicated, but you eventually get used to it.<br />I would have preferred a wider wide-angle too, and the on-camera flash is nothing special. And it EATS batteries! Also, my example occasionally refuses to switch; the only way is to open the battery cover. It's not exactly small either...<br />BUT the pictures it takes can hardly be faulted - even blown up to A3 size!","I've had this camera now for 5 weeks and like it even better than when I first got it. In my first review (here)I sent my camera out for service, well it only took 8 days from out the door to back in. Nikon service is great and you can track progress along the way via an 800 #.  All the review treads here are pretty accurate for this camera, so I'll keep this basic. The Coolpix 990 is an awesome machine. The pictures are beautiful!  The camera has a swivel joint that allows you to point the lens assembly in one direction and swivel the LCD so you can see it, allowing for holding the camera overhead and focusing in on your subject over crowds. It allows for very creative pictures. I bought extra memory cards and 4 sets of rechargeable nimh batteries that last forever. I get 120+- pics per set of nimh vs 60+- with regular alkali bats, and all I have to do is recharge them to go again, BIG savings.. There are tons of add-on accys. for this camera; zoom lens, filters, external flashes, panorama brackets, you name it. I'm adding lenses and flashes myself. There is a photo book written for the 990 that details the manual settings, with examples, that allows you to take abvantage of the powerful control options built in to this camera.  Your possibilities are enormus. Or you can switch into Auto mode and, point & shoot. There are BB forums dedicated to this camera that have lots information for accy. combos, shooting advice, or knowledge sharing. Before I bought this, I read all the reviews and visited camera stores to physically check all the options available. The 990 has a great feel to it; very solid, an easy menu to navigate, and the control buttons are laid out for a comfortable, quality, feel. Competing cameras are too small for my hands and/or don't take as good a picture. I download my digital pics to on-line developers who mail photo prints back to me. No more bad pictires, and you can't tell the difference between digital vs 35mm film. However, i find that printing the photos on my printer with good paper yields photos that (when framed) rival photo finishing from a developer. This technology is truly amazing. I now find mysely going on lots of picture taking hikes experimenting with the different settings on the camera. I can see the results immediatly in the LCD, learn from my mistakes, delete the bad, make adjustments, and take more good pics -vs- taking a roll of film, getting it developed, spending lots of $ for film and processing, forgetting what settings I did in the first place, and having lots of bad pics. THe savings will pay for the camera and accessories! Oh, and in the 5 weeks I had this camera, I took almost 2000 pictures. Do the math and save the money! (2000 pics / 24 pics per roll = 83 rolls. $15 (film & developing costs) per roll and I would of spent $1,250. and had lots of bad pics to boot over the last 5 weeks. This is Really cool stuff. I don't know what else to say, Great camera, great support from Nikon, and endless resources to improve on your camera skills. You'll never be sorry you got this camera. Once you step into the digital world, you'll never go back to film. Try it, you'll like it.","I have used Nikon 35mm cameras for many years.  I have also bought many point & shoot cameras.  When digital point & shoot cameras exceeded three megapixels, I learned I could get sharp 8x10 prints on my inkjet printer that came close to the quality of 35mm 8x10's.  The Coolpix 990 has many of the same features as its 35mm counterparts.  For example, it has similar metering patterns: matrix, center-weighted, and spot.  It also has selectable focusing and spot metering areas, just like the F5 and F100 35mm cameras.  It also has flash compensation, exposure compensation, fill flash, red-eye reduction, and slow sync flash, just like the 35mm \"big boys\".  If all this sounds complicated, trust your instincts.  This is a camera aimed at experienced photographers, or those who are interested in a fully adjustable point and shoot digital camera with all the bells and whistles.  A nice feature of this camera is that it also has an \"automatic\" mode, which makes most of the decisions for you.  That mode yields acceptable results, and is a nice way to get used to the camera.  I would recommend this camera to someone who is very interested in top quality digital photography.  With the automatic mode, even the more timid or inexperienced members of the family can use it and get good results.  One final bit of advice: Expect to buy additional Compact Flash storage media cards.  I carry two 128MB cards with me and can shoot all day without worries.  Good Luck!","I received my 990 about 2 weeks ago, and I take it everywhere with me.  I share the view of many of the reviewers -- you NEED rechargable NiMh batteries (in the first 3 days I went through 3 sets of alkelines) and a bigger memory card (one reviewer says that you can take only 10 pictures at the best quality on the enclosed 16 Mb card -- in fact, ONE picture at the top quality takes about 9 Mb, so you have to download one before you can get another on.)  These petty complaints notwithstanding, the quality of this camera and the control you get are remarkable.  One excellent aspect of the camera is that it's a wonderful camera to learn photographic technique on.  Every photo taken generates a 5 page data file that records the settings of the camera.  Take 4 pictures of a subject at different settings and you can instantly check to see which is the best, and then check what settings you were using -- f. 4.0 at 1/60th of a second, using spot metering, etc.  If I wanted to do this comparison on my 35 mm I would have to take notes of every setting, then shoot a whole roll of film and have it developed, before I could view the pictures side-by-side.  Now I can take pictures and immediately compare them.","I have owned several digital cameras to date, including some earlier Nikon models.  I think this is the best of the lot.  I am beginning to use it more and more in place of my beloved SLR cameras.  The results are definitely comprable with those from conventional professional ones.  What else can I say!","I tried it, I borrowed it, so I had to buy it after using it for free a week. The only thing I miss is a pentaprism SLR viewfinder, being able to use my Nikkor lenses and just a little faster action. But, that's begging for a Nikon D1 at 5x the price and 3x the weight (without a lens).<br />The Coolpix 990 has a sharp 3x zoom lens, rendering 9 Megabyte images from moderate wide-angle to short telephoto with the choice of a quick all-auto shooting mode or a fully customizable auto/manual shooting mode. Also you can choose between previewing the image through the fast real zoom rangefinder or the near-100% digital color LCD monitor, plus you can watch the settings in the simple LCD symbol display or complete data superimposed over the color LCD image.<br />I like to let the camera choose all settings for quick, instantly ready snapshots, or use any of the multiple features to get the best possible semi-automatic or manual exposure when time and needs are suitable.<br />Images look great on a 8x10 \" ink jet print, I have even sold a picture for a graphics trade magazine cover, and it was a wide-format original which had to be cropped.<br />The main point, with Nikon Coolpix 990, you always have the choice. Plus, it is well built, compact, rugged, quick, and allows you to choose from a wide range of add-ons to build a system that is ... anything but a D1.","I had a Nikon 950, and now the 990. I really love the machine. you can really enjoy photography with this tecnology.!! Now we have good printing facilities, (OFOTO, PRINTROOM, etc) and this technology is mature. I will be putting my old type of camara a NIkon N70 to auction. Photography has changed for ever. About 990. Realy good stuff, quick. You need speedy Compact Flash to perform well and update to Bios of the machine will make 990 perform... Really good for low light conditions.!!","I have used 35mm SLR cameras for over 20 years.  I was hesitant to delve into the digital realm.  Here are the pros and cons of this camera with respect to 35mm SLRs.<br />Pros:<br />No film to deal with.  You can view the results of your photos immediately.  This is great for playing with framing or bracketing (over/underexposing), or other creative things: you can delete the shots that just did not work.  The others you can save for printing or for use on the computer.  This feature is great for any picture you take.  You can see how it turned out.  You will know if so-and-so had their eyes closed or if things were moving too fast for the shutter speed.  I can not stress how convenient this is.  You can delete and then retake bad shots!<br />The lens on this camera tilts every which way.  I use a tripod frequently: I do not have to adjust the tilt angle of the tripod with this camera--I just tilt the camera lens.<br />The LCD display frees your eye from being stuck to the viewfinder.  This is incredibly convenient.  You can hold the camera at arms-length and still see what's in the viewfinder.<br />Compact size.  The Coolpix is smaller than most SLRs and the memory cards are so much smaller than film.<br />Ability to control \"white balance\".  No more yellow indoor shots.<br />Cons:<br />Lack of lens flexibility.  With a SLR you click-and-twist one lens off and click-and-twist a different one on, period.  You have limited screw-on choices with this camera.  Also you have to change the camera's computer settings to use these lenses.  It takes about 30 seconds (or more if you have to drag out the manual) to make a lens change with the Coolpix.<br />Aperatures are more limited on this camera.  This is especially troublesome for portraits or other photos where a very wide aperature/shallow depth-of-field is often desirable.<br />Color print quality is subject to the quality of your PC printer.  And yes, you can have professional printing done--it's just an extra hassle.  If you have a poor quality printer you may need to buy a NEW printer to get the results you want.<br />I don't know how to explain it, but Coolpix digital pictures are just not the same as film pictures.  Some aspects are better, some seem worse.<br />Battery issues and other issues as mentioned by other reviewers.<br />Conclusion:<br />I WILL NOT get rid of my 35mm SLRs--they cannot be completely replaced by the Coolpix for all situations.<br />I WILL use my Coolpix 990 for many, many snapshots and many kinds of \"creative\" pictures, as well.","OK, I admit, it's an expensive little toy, but well worth it. Great digital camera, easy to use for beginners, but I suggest that a person with a good knowledge of photography buy's this one, cause there is a lot of option that a beginner in photography will never use. I also suggest to buy Ni-Mh batteries if you want to take more than 10 pictures with the LCD screen on. I won't go into all the details, I'm only gonna say that if you buy it, you won't regret it...only your bank account will, but hey, everybody needs to treat themselves sometimes...","I have read, with interest, most of the reviews of this product. This is my third Coolpix Digital Camera. (Coolpix 900 and Coolpix 950.) Each generation has been a significant improvement over the previous generation, and, from my perspective, well worth the upgrade.<br />I agree with much of the other reviewers comments:<br />1. Definitely purchase NIMH rechargeable batteries. They last much longer than anything else. I keep 3 extra sets with my camera at all times.<br />2. It was necessary for me to not only have a larger CompactFlash Card (64MB and 96MB) but to have two or three extras. It is an issue like carrying a couple of extra rolls of film. However, since the CompactFlash Cards are almost infinitely reusable, the more pictures you take, the quicker you recover your costs.<br />3. Whereas the 990 takes great pictures by itself, you can improve them significantly by using a photo editing program such as Photoshop. I have found this to be true for both print film and slides. You get a much better picture when scanned and edited in your computer.<br />4. If the quality of the final prints is important, some form of dye sublimation printing process is essential to avoid the pixelation inherent in (particularly older) inkjet technology. Epson's Photo printers seem to have solved the problem, but I prefer the dry media printers. I use an Alps MD 5000, which unfortunately is no longer available in the USA.<br />When it comes to the drawbacks noted by several of the other reviewers, I believe familiarity with the camera and the digital system of photography will alleviate most of them. One of the reviewers seemed to have had a defective product, rather than anything inherently wrong with the 990.<br />The only real complaint I have about the 990 (and I believe it is a problem with any digital camera that depends on an LCD view screen) is that it is very difficult to see the images in bright sunlight. I think Nikon should design a hood to shade the screen. I have done makeshift things without great success.<br />Overall, I am well pleased with my 990. I rarely use my Nikon film cameras, and then usually for long lens shots. I can't recommend this camera too highly.","I just bought a Coolpix 990 last week and LOVE the camera.  Out of the box, you just put the batteries and flastcard in, turn it on and, point and shoot.  It's that easy.  USB image transfer to computer is easy, just drag and drop. But the software included isn't that great, Nikon had to send me a backordered disk and the catalog software is a hassle to figure out.  I just want to snap pictures. The camera eats batteries, about 60 shots (half with flash)per set of 4 bats, so get some rechargables, nimh are the best. And get an extra memory card too.. I edit shots in PhotoShop or MS Picture-it then print them out.  Great resolution and color.  Wonderful pictures. Bye bye 35 mm film. Now the negatives.  My camera broke today, 8 days out of the box.  I have to send it to the service center.  Tech support must be hearing a lot of the same thing, (wont shut off, zoom clicks, no menu differientation) its like the program shorted out or something. SO am I satisfied? YES!  I don't want a refund or another camera (I looked at them ALL), just the camera fixed and back in my hands.  I highly recommend the camera to all, it's a great camera, easy to use, takes great pics, and I can do a lot of advanced stuff too, but not til it's back from the shop. Happy snapping. CJ","First of all, I've owned the Olympus D-220 digital camera since it came out 3 years ago and had a great time with this 1/3 megapixel camera at home and at work combined with an Epson Stylus Color 600. I've taken about a thousand shots in this time, remarkable since my film camera still has undeveloped rolls from 4 years ago (just too lazy to get it developed). My 3x5 printouts came out surprisingly good, both for baby pix as well as for my office brochure. After extensive research online (including reading all these Amazon reviews) I decided to step up to a multi-megapixel camera, and the 990 has not disappointed. Certainly this is not a point and shoot like my old digital camera. However, it has a nice automatic as well as manual setting; it behaves like a point and shoot if you want it to (and takes amazing shots on this setting). After spending a few days reading the comprehensive manual, I am amazed at the finesse you can now apply to photographs if you have the time and inclination; 8 second exposures, grey scale photos, rapid-fire mode (I get up to 10 shots at 1.5 exposures a second), a macro feature allowing shots as close as 1 inch...it goes on. The size of my photos has jumped from a 72k jpeg to 700+k jpeg for an average shot, and now my hard drive needs upgrading, but thats a different story. I haven't been able to tell the difference between FINE and NORMAL setting at 2048x1056, and hence my 128M Lexar compact flash that I bought gets me about 160 photos per outing. I am still printing with an Epson 600, and plan to upgrade when Epson gets it right with its 870 and 1270 series printers and the color fade issue. With a few very minor tweaks with Photoshop on my Mac, these are eye popping photos. Couldn't be happier.","Read [...] before you start down the path to purchase a digital  camera. The Nikon 990 is a good camera, no question. It is not the best  choice for a point and shoot family camera, but is good for ther person  that desires a good deal of control over the image captured.<br />The 990  does have quirks. Besure that it has the features you want first and that  images will suit your use.<br />There is no good reason to be surprised by  your digital camera purchase.","As a semi-professional commercial photographer, I know what quality is and how much it costs. Bottom-Line for starters, the Nikon-990 makes great  color shots with very (not so suprising) High-detail. The Advertisments say  \"good\" for 8x10 photos; as a very picky guy, NIKON is telling the  truth. The 5x7 prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors. Since not  many prints are not made larger than 5x7, the superlative colors in this  print size will likely give the Film Camera buffs a challange. This camera  is easy to use & small, however has an exhaustive number of features.  My wife and our 13 year old, carry it on all vacation locations; And when I  don't want to carry my larger and heavier commercial camera. I was truly  shocked at the excellent picture quality of the NIKON 990 which also  includes great software, so after a picture taking day/nite, one can easily  connect to the yellow video plug on your TV (or Hotel TV) for a slide show  of the days activities. I would recommend purchasing two (2) 80MB memory  card with the camera purchase, so you'll get plenty of picture  opportunities (an 80MB card has room for 50 shots per card at max its  resolution) without having to worry about running out of memory. So for a  day's shooting two 80MB cards will give the equivalent of four (25-shot)  rolls of film.  Since you can erase shots that you don't like, take MANY,  MANY shots and then pick the best ones you like to save, and for printing  or e-mailing. I bring my laptop with me on trips, so in the evening, I can  copy the photo-files to the lap-top's hard disk, and erase the camera  memory card, so there's room for another 50 photos available in preparation  for the next days photo activities. NIKON provides serial, USB cables, and  software to accomplish this simply. Definitely do NOT buy a digital camera  with less than 2,000,000 pixels. (The older models, presently having good  sale prices, are technology of 3 years ago, and you'll wish you spent the  extra money for a higher resolution camera). Since NIKON has been the  camera business for many, many years, its no surprise that they have  created an electronic imager (the CCD Chip) with EXCELLENT Color quality  and detail. This is must have, you'll not be dissappointed. If you're on a  tighter budget check out the KODAK-280 at less than $500 which takes  excellent photos for a 2,000,000 pixel camera. If you have another few  hundred dollars, check out the SONY or OLYMPUS dye-sublimation printers,  which produce actual photo quality continuous tone prints up to 4x5 sizes;  These printers are not dot-matrix's with all the little dots. The camera  and the printer makes for a great combo family gift for under $1,500, that  anyone in the family can use without having to even turn on a computer, as  the printer prints directly off the camera memory card. Don't make yourself  craze, since DIGITAL Cameras are slightly different than a typical film  point-and-shoot cameras, be sure to read the instruciton booklet, before  pushing all the buttons. The documentation NIKON provides is very easy to  understand. So take it slow when you open the Box for the first time. It's  intuitive to use, after the first 2 outings, you NOT need to keep going  back to the booklets. My wife and 13 year old son love this camera (as do  I)and they have no trouble dealing with the camera's features, which are  exhaustive.  This 3.340,000 pixel camera is one of the best I've tested  yet. ONE more point, the camera can twist at its middle (permitting the  lens to point up or down, with the LCD Pannel staying directly in-line with  your eyes) which is an amazing engineering idea which gives the  photographer a whole new perspective for taking pictures without having to  have the camera pressed against your face. The LCD screen is bright even  out doors.  JLW/2000/08/25.","As a french advertising agency, we were waiting for a digital camera that  would be able to keep it up in quality with a 135 mm camera. Tired of  having to run to get slides scanned, films processed, we finally were told  by a friend professional photographer that the 990 seemed to be the first  camera that could help us jump those annoying and long processes.<br />We  bought it and, oh! What a great piece of hardware. Buy it with lots of  memory on the compactcard, an extra rechargeable battery pack and there you  go. This camera makes fabulous quality (specially in HI/fine mode) top  quality photos, finally usuable for A4 print and use in Xpress or Indesign.  The colors look great (even in studio use, as the menu proposes a choice of  different artificial lighting sets -tungstene, neon, etc...).","...  I've previously been using a JVC digital camcorder (which flaked out on us - if you ever get one, be sure to get a good extended warranty to cover complete equipment failure), so I find myself comparing the Coolpix  to the camcorder.  Picture quality on the Coolpix is excellent, although it  seems to not perform too well under low lighting (at least, not without  using the flash).  The optical zoom isn't that spectacular, either (only  3x).  Daylight pix are great though, sharp and clear, and there are none of  those JPEG \"artifacts\" you see from cheaper cameras.<br /> I found  the Coolpix to be quite usable right out of the box.  It comes with 4 AA  batteries, which don't seem as short-lived as I'd been fearing. Then again,  I'm more used to the camcorder whose battery only lasted 15-20 minutes, so  the Coolpix seems far superior there already.  I did, nonetheless, order a  set of NiMH batteries + charger.<br /> Save your money on the extras, though  - if you're only taking photos for the web, you probably don't need a  bigger compact flash card - the 16Mb card included with the camera will  hold 40 \"basic\" quality images, which are 2048x1536 pixels.  And  forget about buying an expensive card reader. ...  Or you could just buy an a/c adapter for your camera and run off  electric while you download images from the camera.","Boy - when this camera can get a good focus lock, there's enough lighting, the planets are in alignment, and angels sing, the pictures that come out of this camera are OUTSTANDING.<br />The only problem, though, are those pesky angels and planets. They just don't cooperate.<br />I've used an Olympus  C2000-Z for the past year. I found the pictures to be of somewhat  consistent quality - some better than others - maybe 3-5 out of a  \"roll\" (16MB smartcard) to be worth sharing with my family.<br />I bought the Nikon 950  before I got the Oly - and had to return it out of frustration with the  user interface and the inability of the camera to obtain a focus lock - and  take the picture.<br />And that's if the camera didn't lock up. Heck - it's  not Windows. You shouldn't need to \"reboot\" your camera. In a  week, the 990 locked up (requiring me to take the batteries out) five or  six times. The 950 was just as bad.<br />I found a better UI with the 990 -  but similar frustrations with focus. In low light situations, you better be  on a tripod, and have a flashlight handy to let the camera get a focus  lock. From what I understand, there are cameras coming out (Fuji has one)  that have what SLR owners are used to - a low light focus assist  illumination lamp. This camera desparately needs one.<br />If you need to take  a picture of something moving - get a focus lock BEFORE your subject gets  into view - or the camera becomes very confused, and you're left staring at  the viewfinder's blinking green \"I'm not ready to take a picture - I  can't focus\" light. And your subjects look at you, smiling politely...  \"Did you get it?\"<br />\"No.\"<br />\"Boy, that camera is  slow, huh? I thought the box said 'superhigh performance'?\"<br />\"Ha  ha. Very funny. Where's my old Oly? I want this shot.\"<br />Anyway - make  sure you buy it at some place that has a 30 day money back guarantee. You  may need to exercise that guarantee.<br />(Besides the bad focus  and system hangs, I also found Nikon's Windows software to be buggy. You'll  want to get a standalone USB card reader. And why didn't Nikon embrace  SmartCard Type II? I want to use that IBM microdrive, gosh durn it!)<br />BTW  - Digital photography is GREAT. I'm hooked.","As a longtime Nikon groupie I expected an excellent piece of hardware and that is what I got. I am annoying my friends and co-workers no end. However, one suprise was that the download software does not include a  TWAIN interface - a major disadvantage for us Photoshop users, and the  supplied software appears to have a major memory leak with Windows98. Even  though I have 256 Meg of ram installed, shortly after transfering photos  from the 990, I get an 'memory is low' message and always have to reboot.  This is an excellent camera, but the software needs a major overhaul.","I bought a Nikon Coolpix 990 camera on June 23.<br />When I unpacked the camera, I noticed that some of the software that was supposed to be in the box was not there, but--in its place--was a piece of yellow paper referring  the buyer to a \"24 hour, 7 day telephone support number\"<br />I  called the number at about 8:25 PM, EDT and got a series of recordings that  told me that \"...your call is important; please continue to hold and  we will be with you shortly....\"<br />I continued to hold for 50 minutes  and, finally, a live person answered. After giving him my name, address,  phone number and the serial number of my new camera, he said that there was  nothing he could do for me and that I would have to call *the same number*  again, Monday through Friday, during normal business hours.<br />I replied  that this level of \"customer support\" was unacceptable,  especially since I had paid over $1,000 that same day and would not be able  to use all of the camera's features without the missing software.<br />This  way of handling customers is outrageous.<br />I would suggest to anyone even  remotely considering buying any Nikon product that they call Nikon USA  prior to buying and ask for Nikon's assurance that some *real* customer  support will be forthcoming.","This is a review for users of 35mm cameras who are thinking of moving over to their first digital camera.  (Gadget junkies can safely ignore this post.)<br />Let me start by saying that this is a great camera.  For my  purposes the 3M pixel resolution is as good as film.  But if you are just  moving over from a 35mm for the first time you are in a for a few rude  surprises.  Some which are endemic to all digital cameras, some Nikon 990  flaws.<br />1. The built in flash is worse than useless for indoor portraits.  The redeye problem is horrendous and unsolvable with the built-in flash.  You'll find yourself buying an external flash (~$150)and bracket (~$50).  Why they didn't put a hotshoe on the camera is beyond me.<br />2. If you  bought the camera for it's 3m pixel resolution you will find the 16M card  supplied as useful as a 16M Windows machine.  You need at least one 128M  card (~$250) which holds ~80 pictures (unless you plan to tether yourself  to a computer.)<br />3. The LCD display and autofocus eat Alkaline batteries  for lunch.  You'll go through a set every 1.5 hours. At minimum you need  rechargable NiCad's.  If you're going to be outdoors for awhile consider a  rechargable external Nicad pack (~$50)<br />4. Shutter lag time seem a lot  longer (worse) than 35mm cameras. About 1 1/2 seconds from when you push  the shutter to when the camera goes \"click\" in auto mode.  Ouch.<br />5. If you are used to \"motor drive\" on your 35mm this  camera will drive you crazy.  There is a 1.5 second delay between photos  for the first two photos and 7 (yes seven!) seconds for the following one.  You simply cannot shoot a series of \"action\" pictures at high  res.<br />6. Oh, hope you didn't expect a carrying case when you bought your  camera.  It's ok because once you buy the external flash and bracket you  need a larger one anyway.<br />7. Getting pictures into your PC via the  compact flash cards are a no brainer if you have either a) USB or b) PCMCIA  adapter for a portable.  In either case you need an compact flash adapter  (~$50 for the PC ~$10 for a portable computer).  Of course you can connect  your camera directly to the computer, but trust me, get an adapter. Make  sure your USB port works before buying the camera.<br />8. Hope you bought an  Epson 1270 or a printer with equivalent quality (~$450)to print your  photos.  If not, get a cheaper (less resolution) camera.<br />9. Get familar  with Shutterfly.com to send photos to your relatives.<br />Summary: Great  camera.  If you're happy taking pictures of the family on a 35mm the  resolution of this camera won't disappoint or embarass you.  However, the  amount of work and manual reading may.  Plan on spending another $500+ for  peripherals.  Learn battery management skills.  Learn how to make every  shot count.","Best camera I ever had. With Lexar Media flashcards you can hold at least 79 pictures in normal XGA mode. I takes up alot of batteries. Use recharble nikads. Run them up and down a couple of times. One feature I love is the  delete button. I can take some good pictures but out of 100 pictures I  normaly have to throw away at least 5. You also can print as many pictures  as you want. So what, it's around $900.00 in about 3 years you could pay  off that because you don't have to pay for film, devolping and printing.  The LCD display is 100% acurate. Why spend the extra money for a camera  that has \"You see what you get\" when you can have this camera. I  was so impressed that I threw my film camera away without thinking about  it.","The included 16MB card holds about 22ish images on the normalsetting (2048x1536, crystal clear).  I picked up a 160MB CF+ card (204images on normal setting) from Lexar Media (USB enabled) - and a couple of their JumpShot USB connector cables (home, work, laptop).  I took the camera on a trip and shot 173 pictures and 4 videos - and had lots of room left on the card!  I have also been using the card as an extremely portable (1\" x 1\" x 1/8\") hard-drive between work and home.  With a JumpShot cable, it plugs directly into a USB port of your computer and becomes a regular hard-drive --> no camera needed for download, save your batteries for taking pictures! Good bye ZIP, JAZZ, and SCSI detachable drives!  Hello ultra-portable high-speed CF+ cards!","My needs in a digital camera were simple, or so I thought. I take a lot of photos, 10-15 or more rolls at a time, which can get very expensive when you take into account the cost of film, developing and printing. It is also  time consuming, as I scan the best ones and print them out as 8 x 10s. Not  to mention a pain, carrying lots of film, lenses, filters, etc. around with  me. My aim was to save money and time, but I didn't want to sacrifice  quality, either.<br />The Nikon Coolpix 990 takes excellent photos, and 8x10s  print very nicely. I added a $400 flash card and that has plenty of room  for lots of pictures (about 80 at fine quality), as poor shots can be  deleted immediately. Downloading the pictures to my laptop is a breeze with  the included usb cable (another review said that cut and paste doesn't  work, but it works fine for me). It's rather heavy on batteries, but once I  switched to rechargeable AAs there was a big improvement. One plus digital  cameras have over film is being able to adapt to current lighting  conditions - no fiddling with filters if taking photos indoors without a  flash, for example. So far, I was very pleased.<br />The major flaw, for me,  came when I used the optional 2X lens (bought at the same time as the  camera). Nowhere in the literature I read before I bought the camera did it  mention that attaching the lens disables the flash. You can't even use an  external flash with it. I take many shots in poor light and at a distance,  and this renders the camera unusable in those circumstances as I am often  also unable to use a tripod. I was more than a little annoyed to find that  after spending close to $2000 total, I still had to take my 35mm camera  with me. I don't know if this is peculiar to the Nikon or common among  digital cameras, but I didn't see it mentioned anywhere.<br />Despite this, I  am pleased with the camera, and would recommend it, especially if most of  your photos are taken outdoors or in bright indoor lighting. On my last  trip I shot only two rolls of 35mm film. At this rate the camera will have  paid for itself within the year in film and film developing savings, and  it's worth its weight in gold for the time I save on scanning and  retouching photos.","Nikon has been paying attention. One of the things I disliked about my Coolpix 950 is that it has a non-changeable default on the zoom which zooms all the way out when it is turned on. The 990 lets you decide.  I use a  MAC G3 powerbook and found that downloading images by cable to be slow and  cause frequent crashes and lost images. A PCMCIA reader for $15 solved this  problem and speeded up the process.  LCD is still terrible in daylight  and no hood is being made available.  Accessory lense adapters still  block the optical view finder.  Card slot is located on side now which  is great when using a tripod or copy stand.  This camera works great  for copywork!  Rechareable NMH batteries or Quantum pak are the way to  go for power. Or turn off the LCD and save power. The Coolpix 990 is worth  stepping up to!","Amazing!  This camera takes pictures so clear and high-definition that I will never use film again.  The USB connection to my PC makes downloading amazingly simple - just drag and drop.  It does everything - including 40  second QuickTime movies!  I am a believer.","Fantastic Digital Camera. Very high resolution, excellent optics, excellent light metering.<br />Easy to use for amateurs as well as sufficiently flexible for use by semi-pros. Battery life has been  significantly improved from the previous 2 generations. \"The\"  must for whomever has interest in digital photography.","let me know if you have this camera in stock for immediate delivery","Briefly put... This is the best digital camera to date for non-pro-photography use ($3000+ range). The feature list is complete, and the optics are excellent (you'll be amazed by the resolution).<br />For WinNT  (non-USB users), I would recommend a parallel port compact-flash card  reader ($50 +/-). And don't forget some extra compact-flash cards.","This camera just arrived from Amazon to me yesterday.<br />Since I have used and owned several high-end consumer digital cameras I note the following should others be interested in this camera.<br />1.  This camera is for a true  enthusiast, a person testing high end consumer digital cameras before  buying the professional line for business, or for I guess, a person who  just has the bucks to have the latest.<br />2.  I love it since I am  constantly imaging events or children and need to have a camera that is  fast (does not take for ever for it to focus and capture the image from the  time you click the camera to the time it captures the image to put on disk.  It records to disk (memory/digital film - whatever you want to call it),  It needs to have capacity for high storage, fast downloads.<br />3.  The  camera itself in comparison to other cameras of this style and caliber is  quite easy to use.  (The swivel feature is really nice to get those angles  that are harder to get)<br />4. Minimal weight and size for its features.  Nice.<br />5.  Getting the images to computer uses the drag and drop concept  of windows.  Since at the point of arrival, this camera did not have its  software ready to make upload easy like most cameras have.  Per the note  packaged in the camera, it will not be available for Win 98 users till June  2000ish.<br />The drag and drop is not intuitive.  You should have reasonable  windows knowlege to figure out that you need to open both the Nikon viewer  and a window set on the location of where you want to put the images.  DRAG  and DROP.  Copy and paste does NOT work.<br />But once you get the idea using  the camera with USB cable is so fast in comparison to that of serial....  this flies.<br />6.  Though they do now have 24/7 cs....I was on hold for 2  hours 10 minutes before the line was cut off.  Though I had them on speaker  phone, was able to have dinner and dress the kids for bed, it was  annoying.<br />7.  So, since Nikon service is rather poor (unless you are  talking about the sales dept), I reccomend that if you buy this camera, and  are spending this kind of money on a camera, you need to have: good  digital camera knowlege/experience, very good windows and windows imaging  knowlege, wants to be able to have high quality prints made when that  \"oh so special\" image is actually captured to disk and a really  trustworthy dealer.","In truth, this is the first digital camera that I have owned, though I have owned Nikons and Leicas for years. I tried the 950 and was very impressed, but the CoolPix 990s improved resolution, refinements, flexibility and ease of connectivity to my PC (plug & play using the USB cable supplied with the camera) make this a hand's down winner in all respects. I've purchased separately a larger capacity memory card since the 16MB capacity memory card supplied was inadequate for a day's worth of photos (approximately 20 normal shots). Notwithstanding the inherent demanding power requirements of a digital camera (keep a spare quad of AAs with you at all times), the CoolPix 990 is a must for any serious digital shutterbug.","I'd have to say that until this camera came out I'd been banking my imaging needs on 35mm that'd been scanned.  With the 990 I feel the days of film development are long gone for this product serves my needs above and  beyond what's necessary or even expected.<br />I am running this product in a  professional environment and it is performing exceedingly well.  Some of my  work has been in macro (e-mail me for a sample macro pic) and general  studio work.  The generous number of features makes this camera rival some  high-end 35mm SLR's.  If you photograph for the web (As I do) this product  surely will not disappoint.<br />The down side is that it came with only a  16mb Flash Card and a USB to plug into the camera.  I will likely buy a USB  card reader so that I can plug my cards in to my PC for uploading pics.","Out of fairness to Nikon, I need to provide a sequel to my previous critical comments. When used with a CF card reader to communicate with your computer, this system is nothing short of astounding. This is the first digital camera I have used, and I expected to get a semi-toy that mainly  lived because of the gee-whiz digital 'film'. This is no toy. It's got most  of the features of high-end 35mm cameras, and is a legitimate professional  tool. Of course, its 3.3 megapixel resolution can't compete with properly  exposed 35mm film, but for many applications it is enough. I printed a  full-size 8 1/2 x 11 page, and the detail was pretty respectable. The range  of focus and exposure control options (including, of course, fully manual)  make this a camera that can handle many of the oddball situations where  I've had to burn lots of Polaroid film to get the setup right. It's a shame  that Amazon's catalog pages fail to indicate how limited this system can be  without the extra-cost card reader (not a lot of money, but it also burns a bunch of  time to try to figure out how to get by with the cables it's shipped with).","The Nikon 990 is a complete makeover of the Nikon 950.  It manages to combine the best features of the 950 with many of the things people have been asking for since the original 900 first came out.  The optics are  superb and the 3.34 megapixel resolution produces a picture that rivals  film.  The layout of the camera is improved and the joypad on the back  makes navigating the menus quick and easy.  The programable function keys  let you have the features you need under your fingers when you shoot one  handed.  The only way it could be better would be if it was waterproof."]},{"name":"Olympus C-3030 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["made  over 200,000 photos with it ... this  camera made me decide to get the canon eos m camera, since i have canon lenses and a canon 30d, which i use all the time , but cant take it with me everywhere, as i did this olympus ... like they say, big cameras like my canon 30d stay home 95% of the time .... i recently got the canon 2500 pocket camera, but its very slow when you press down the shutter ... memories, many photos with this little olympus are on my facebook page ... and i posted a photo of my doc of homeopathy, who brings people back to life from cancers to lupus ...","Full featured and easy to use, this camera takes fantastic images.

It's fairly compact, and it's lived up to its reputation. The Camedia software makes downloading the photos pretty easy. I just leave the cable hooked up to my computer and attach the camera when I need to download. No need for docking stations. As a digital camera neophite, I'm pleased with my purchase. I leave the 35mm camera at home now.","I purchased this camera because I needed to be able to send Photos by E-Mail.

I would certainly buy this camera again.","This is my first digital camera and I am extremely happy with the quality of the images it produces.  If all digital cameras produce images of this quality, I don't see why everyone is waiting to get their first digital camera.<br />The problems that I have with this camera include:<br />The size of the camera is much larger than many other digital cameras on the market.  It is also larger than most current consumer-targeted 35mm and APS cameras.  It is not as large as a 35mm SLR camera however.<br />The lense cap on this camera does not have a strap.  This is a problem that is compounded by the fact that the lense cap falls off relatively easily when pressure is applied to it.  A replacement cap with a strap can be purchased from Olympus.<br />My only other comment is that the camera delays a split-second or so after pressing the shutter button before the image is taken.  This makes the camera very impractical for shooting anything in which a lot of action is involved.  You will likely miss the shot you intended to take.  I do not regularly take these types of pictures, however, so it isn't much of an issue.<br />Overall, I really like the camera.  My replacement cap fixes the strap issue, and I regularly travel with a backpack when I take my camera, so the size isn't a problem.  (A carrying case with a belt loop is also available.)","3 things I must say about the C3030:<br />1. the lens cap isn't strapped, wich sometimes can be anoying when you want to keep your lens clean.<br />Especially when you are walking or have to handle quickly, bad weather ...<br />2. The screen of the LCD is \"outside the frame\" of the cam, wich can cause scratches. (I've already have some).<br />3.

It was my replacement for the D600L from Olympus.<br />Negatives:  not many.  My biggest pet peeve is the battery low indicator is not as accurate as I'd like.  The camera actually begins to lose functionality long before low battery is displayed.  And the camera goes downhill very quickly.  But the symptoms are more like the camera has lost some functionality and not others (inability to zoom but still able to focus).  I've just become used to replacing the battteries as soon as I start having any strange issues.<br />Its not as small as I'd like.  The D200L was a great size for a camera.  This one is still too big for my liking.  I'd like to have something that really does fit in my pocket (like the size of my cellular phone would be good.<br />Positives:  Get the 32Mb memory card and you can take photos for  what seems like forever!<br />Superb low-light capability, good focus, excellent color, fantastic resolution.","First, let me say - I am a rank amateur when it comes to the vagaries of photography. That being said, I can't say enough about this camera. It is easy to use and extremely versatile. I could not have been more pleased with the results from this camera while travelling in Alaska. The pictures I came back with are wonderful. This was after about a week of practice, taking pictures of my grandchildren.<br />The menu system this camera uses is certainly not intuitive, but can be learned easily enough with a minimum of practice. The guidebook that is supplied with the camera is well organized and useful. I suggest that the new user take some time and read through it. I admit that the guidebook is pretty dry reading, but there are nuggets of valuable information scattered throughout. It will be worth the effort.<br />As to battery consumption, it will eat batteries for lunch. Multiple sets of NiMH batteries with a charger are the only way to go.<br />All in all, I am extremely happy with the results from this camera. I thonk you will be, too.","I've been using this camera since April 2000 and really enjoy it.  I am not a skilled photographer and still don't know how to work half of the features of this camera but am able to get great shots.  The resolution is great and I love the Camedia software that comes with it.  If you buy this, make sure to buy rechargable NMH batteries and a charger - it uses a lot of batteries.  Also, upgrade the card to get a lot more pictures.  Since you're not wasting film, you'll find yourself taking way more pictures and deleting the ones you don't want later.  Although there are cameras with more mega-pixels out now, make sure you consider the quality of the lense when purchasing a digital camera.  You won't go wrong with Olympus or Nikon, but some of the other brands really don't have the same optical quality and that effects pictures as much or more than just the pixel count.","I love everything about this camera except for the flash.  It isn't strong enough or disfused enough to light the entire frame.  You'll get shadows in the lower corners.","I have had an olympus 3030 for about two months now, I use it mainly for personal pictures and work (marine field biology). The pictures are sometimes great and sometimes not so great, and photoshop is fairly limiting. Resolution is of course very good, I use it on lower resolution for personal pictures and high resolution for digital analysis of marine pictures (with optimas software). Any possible marine housing would be extremely expensive, and I am sometimes worried about the camera dying from wave spray or rain. If I had it to do over again I think I would spend the extra $... and get a 3040 with the new \"brighter\" lens, or a sony camera with bright pictures and cheap housing. My major complaint is that if conditions are not perfect the pictures look washed out and can not be \"fixed\" adequately with photoshop.","I bought this camera after looking for a long time. It has many features. I also bought a 64 mb smartmedia and I can take up to 81 pics in HQ mode, and about 200 seconds of movie mode. The pictures are nice and crisp. Very Great camera for the price.","After using an older \"first generation\" digital camera for quite a while, a upcoming overseas trip prompted me to look for a newer one.  After looking at all the reviews I bought the Olympus 3030 Zoom.  Since the new 3040 had just come out (F 1.8 lens compared to the F 2.8 lens on the 3030) the price had dropped dramatically.  I'm amazed by the quality of the pictures that this camera takes.  Even in extremely low light circumstances, I can turn of the flash and get beautiful natural light pictures.  I can only imagine what the F 1.8 lens on the new 3040 model would do!  The menu is easy to use and the camera is delighlfully small.  Manual settings are easy to adjust, but the auto setting mode is dead-on except for difficult shots like those with backlighting.  The video mode also works great and captures both video and sound for short periods (200 seconds on a 64 mb card at HQ resolution).  This is a great camera and the price is also great.  The only downside is a lens cap that is not engineered to stay on the lens....buy a tether unless you want to keep replacing it!","I spent a good bit of time looking at several camera's and decided to purcahse the Olympus C 3030.  I have had it a week or so and am very happy with the purchase and the price.  I upgraded to a 64mg card and could not be happier.  The pictures are incredibly clear and crisp and the functionality is impressive.","And I paid $899 for this camera, I wish I would have waited.  However - never been sorry once for getting this camera - it takes beautiful pictures - both on high quality and low quality settings.  Great outdoor pictures, great indoor pictures - however I have to touch up red eye - but other than that - great pictures even when totally dark outside.  I do a lot of digital editing and use digital images in my job as web developer.  Do not know what I would do without this camera!  Easy to operate - but features deluxe with sound and movies.","I have to say i was stunned by the quality of the picture i downloaded from this small black box. We could see every single hair of our 15 months daughter!. 3 Mega pixels, that's impressive. Our friends are really stunned too by this quality, the crispness of the image, and their bright colors. The camera is very easy to use as a point and shoot too. The only problem is the auto-focus that has a tendency of focusing on the background rather than the subject itself sometimes.<br />A very very good camera overall, probably my best buy of the year as far as i am concerned.","I just received this camera a couple of days ago and it is better than I imagined. I'm not an expert in digital photography, but I got into 35mm photography back in the '70s. This camera does everything an SLR camera can do and more. Aperture preferred - shutter preferred - spot metering - film speed - exposure bracketing - macro mode - flash control - remote control.... I could go on and on. You've got a dozen picture resolution choices, you can make short movies, you can hook the camera up to the TV and view the pictures, and the quality is sensational. I use the USB cable to upload to my MAC IBook (forget Windows). With my Epson inkjet printer and glossy photo paper I get  8x10s that look better than 35mm glossy enlargements. This is what 35mm photographers used to dream about. I installed the 64MB smart media card and it provides plenty of memory. Do your own due diligence, but this camera does it all.","I am a professional photographer and teach digital photography at a Califonia college. I have both the Olympus E-10 and the Olympus 3030. They both have superb lenses and are easy to use. Despite the better feature set of the E-10, I find myself using the 3030 more often as it is easier to carry around and doesn't \"spook\" subjects since it appears to be a simple point and shoot camera. They are two good cameras, I just get more photos with the 3030.","I bought this camera last year and I love it.  I have noticed that I take many more pictures than I used to and have the ability to immediatly share them with family and friends via e-mail.  If you are in the market for a digital camera there are a couple of things you should look for: 2 megapixal or higher, pick a camera from a company that makes good optics (Nikon, Olympus, minolta, etc.),durability and ease of use.  This camera excels in all of those catagories.  The instruction book that came with the camera fully explained all of the features.  This camera also will let you control the shutter and aperature settings, this is a must for creating some special effects.  During this past year I have no complaints or problems with the camera.  Now that a year has passed I ask myself would I still buy this camera. Answer:no.  I found that I really could use a zoom, this camera only has a 3 power zoom.  The Olympus C-2100 has a 10 power zoom.  My friend bought one last month and I noticed how much more they got out of their camera.  So if you think you will need a zoom for that special wildlife photo take a look at the Olympus C-2100.  To sumerize: this camera is a very well built and reliable.  Just be sure to compare specs with other cameras on the market.","I recently purchased the Olympus 3030 two weeks ago and have been very happy with it.  The picture quality is awesome and it is easy to just point and shoot right out of the box.  The quicktime movies are an added bonus.  My friends & co-workers were very impressed with the picture quality and also with the movie clips I had taken.  Also the battery life seems to be very good and I am using the Olympus B-40SU Ni-MH rechargeable batteries.  I also purchased the Viking 128MB Smart Media card which is working great.<br />The only complaints that I have are that it doesn't come with a AC adapter and that you have to remember to remove the lens cap before you turn it on.  I consider these to be small issues and am otherwise very pleased with this device.","When I was first researching for a digital camera (and it took a lot of researching) the photos for the Olympus C3030 were nice, but after we received it today and you actually have it in your hands - it's incredible!  So small, so easy to use, and so versatile!  Where can you find that in a camera.  Olympus has done a fine job.  I was very surprised though to find that on mysimon this camera was over $100 cheaper than Amazon.  I guess you have to have that kind of profit margin to help bail the floundering boat, but why should we pay for it?  I didn't have to buy two either to get my shipping free.  But look around and get this camera. It is fantastic!","I have just gotten this camera, and already I love it. It works well with the Viking 128MB chip (other than inability to do panorama, not much of a drawback for me) and right out of the box I was able to quickly be pointing and shooting. This is my second digital camera, and I am very impressed with it. The LCD menus are a little tricky to navigate at first, but I am quickly learning where things are. I have experimented with taking pictures at different resolutions and qualities, and also shot some movie clips. I downloaded the results to my computer with little trouble, although I think I would recommend buying either a reader or a PCMCIA adapter for the memory chip, downloading from the camera over it's USB port to the hard drive is a little cumbersome. It takes very nice photos in average lighting without the need for the flash, and I find it very easy to quickly snap a picture, especially of quickly moving subjects like children. It took me a little reading of the manual to discover that the remote only works when the timer is enabled, however once I mastered it I like the 3 second delay so you can hide the remote. I like the ergonomic placement of the controls, I can both hold the camera and work its major functions with a single hand. I didn't see any mention in the manual of the fact that the lens cap has to be removed prior to turning it since the first thing it tries to do is extend the lens barrel. Perhaps the lens cap should snap onto the extensible barrel and not the external housing? These are not major drawbacks but things to bear in mind while learning to use this camera. As a prior user of a digital camera, I think Olympus has done a good job addressing some of the shortcomings of early digital cameras, plus creating a digital camera that looks and feels like the film cameras I have used for years. The touch of the shutter button, picture resolution and recording speed are vastly superior to what I am used to in a digital camera, and compare with a good SLR. All the additional features are there if I want them, but the solid performance of the basic function is a key ingredient. I like to tinker, and having numerous overrides is great, but sometimes I am glad to not to bother with them and just click away, knowing the automatic program is making the right choices for me.","Buy this camera!!! I paid a lot more for it and I still think that it is worth it.<br />The pictures are really more clear than compared to regular cameras and even better than the SONY digital ones.<br />But do buy more Nickel Metal batteries and more memory. You will need it. The 64MB cards holds 81 pics HD mode. Alkaline batteries are useless and drain after 3-5 pics at best. Lithium are not rechargeable. The standard memory on this mode is good for about 20 pics.<br />If you pics is too dark, it also comes with software for you edit the pics. You can zoom in the editing the pics to any size you want. All the features that you dream of and more.<br />If there is a upgrade to the lense to view further, I will buy it too.<br />Best tech/picture taking toy out there.<br />- Will","I've just gotten the camera, and only taken ten or so pictures. From a beginner's perspective, this being my first digital camera, so far I'm not so impressed.<br />There's a noticeable lag between when I click the \"shutter\" button, and the picture is actually taken.  With small children, that delay is somewhat irritating.<br />Also, the USB drivers do not work with Windows 95.  Amazon's technical description, and Olympus's own web site, claim Windows 95 compatability, but that's only for the serial cable, which isn't included.  And apparently, upgrading to a newer Windows won't help - it must be Windows 98/Me originally installed by the manufacturer.  I'm currently exploring buying a USB SmartMedia card reader, since that would be alot cheaper than buying a whole new PC.","I have a C-2020, which is a slightly older version of this camera model.  This has been a fantastic camera both in terms of quality, reliability and battery life.  Between some friends and myself we have just about every model in this family (C-2000 through C-3040) and we all love our cameras.<br />Quality: I have taken hundreds of shots, mostly outdoor.  I tend to shoot at the high-quality jpeg level so I bought a 64MB smart media card.  Paired with my HP DeskJet 952 I regularly printout 4x6 prints on photo paper that are absolutely perfect.  I have printed a few 8x10 pictures and they are fantastic.  No one can believe they were taken with a digital camera.  I have to zoom in quite a ways with my photo editing software before I can see any pixels.  The only negative thing I can say is that I wish it had a better macro mode.<br />Reliability: It has been rained on, splashed by a wave, and dropped a short distance onto a rock.  Despite all this it is still going strong a year and several hundred pictures later with no negative affects.<br />Batteries: I use the rechargeable batteries and during heavy use they last 2-3 weeks.  During light use they last 3-6 months.  Compare this to most Kodak or Nikon cameras that last a few days of heavy use.<br />A few comments on my accessories:<br />Forget the 16MB card that comes with it.  I keep only mine as a back up.  You will want a 64 MB smart media card.<br />I bought the Olympus T-CON14 tele-converter lens 1.45x (152mm equivalent) and I am very happy with it. ... My next purchase is the wide-angle lens.<br />I bought the Olympus Accessory Kit (which is the same for C-2000 through C-3040 models), mostly for the UV filter, adapter tube and 43mm-55mm step-up ring, and AC adapter. ... The mini-tripod, software, and case that come in that kit are not overly impressive but I considered those ‘free’.  The lens cleaning kit is handy.","I have a C-2020, which is a slightly older version of this camera model.  This has been a fantastic camera both in terms of quality, reliability and battery life.

The lens cleaning kit is handy.","With exception to red-eye, I would give it a 10.<br />This works best when taking pictures outside but it is only average at dark places. Try to buy a flash for darker indoors.","I've owned 5 digital cameras in just the last few years and find myself to be very demanding. I researched extensively the cameras available and found that the C3030 is certainly one of the best for the bucks. The only negative thing about the camera is it's time delay between clicking the button and it taking the picture. So if you do a ton of action shots you may want to do some more research. My former Mavicas were instantaneous. Otherwise a great camera.<br />The only negatives I have aren't the camera as much as Olympus... A. Camera lens cover comes off when you look at it wrong. I lost mine in the first week and still have'nt been able to find a relplacement. Get a $2.00 lens cord and you'll be spared this problem. B. Buy more than the 16mb flash card. Unless you shoot just a few pictures and download religiously, you'll want more memory. C. Don't use the LCD panel display unless you own stock in Duracell. Use the SLR through the lens viewer and save a ton on batteries. D. Forget the packaged software provided. Buy a Viking flash reader or just download on to your computer and use a real photo editing program...and if you use Windows 2000 don't even try to load the software.<br />Overall a great camera with great quality images.","Despite the problems with the optical viewfinder being off alot in the zoom mode, and the Quicktime sound falling behind the movie by a factor of 1 frame every 4 seconds, the Olympus C3030Z is an excellent camera for stills.<br />Olympus has relased firmware version 80 which fixes the Quicktime problem, but they have no plans to fix the problem with the viewfinder.","This is an outstanding camera.  I have been a casual photographer for many years and finally took the digital plunge - the C3030 outstrips the performance of my 35 mm SLR, and after much research, I concluded it outperforms most digital cameras as well.  I also read some of the previous reviews, and most of the negative \"problems\" people listed either weren't problems of the camera or were because the person didn't know how to use the camera.<br />When it comes right down to it, picture quality is what makes or breaks a digital camera.  The C3030 sweeps the field.  Color quality and sharpness exceeds my 35 mm.  I took a face portrait of my son and blew it up to just his eyeball - you could count the tiny veins in his eye.  You can easily blow up pictures beyond 8 x 10 and still have sharp pictures.  It does a better job reproducing sharp, realistic colors than most Kodak film.  Low light capability is very good (even better with the new C3040 with its 1.8 lens).  The menu is easily navigated (although it will take a little study of the manual; the camera has a lot of capability) and the controls are, for the most part, very easy to use.  The camera is nicely programmable for those who want to venture there.  The memory-buffered multi-picture capability (like a fast motor drive in an SLR) is very handy for action shots.  The camera is extremely compact considering its capability and can be carried easily.  When taking pictures, it is very comfortable and natural to hold, unlike many other digital cameras.<br /> The USB transfer rate is much better than a serial cable but I took it a step further and bought an inexpensive Smart Media PC card adaptor.  I pop the card out of the camera and into the PC slot and it is a near instant download of 128 MB of pictures! (I purchased the 128 MB card and it holds a huge number of pictures).<br /> It uses up batteries, but no more than other digital cameras.  I purchased 1400mah NiMH batteries and travel charger for only $38 - it works great and lasts a reasonable amount of time; hasn't been a problem.<br /> I have taken many hundreds of pictures, perhaps thousands, without a single glitch.  One of my few complaints is the flash performance, but the camera takes such great pictures without the flash, especially with a tripod, I mostly don't use it.  Again, the new C3040 may take this even one step further.  I also wish the Macro performance was better (closer) but it has been acceptable for most applications.  My next purchase will be the telephoto lens to expand the camera's capabilities.<br /> Bottom line is you will love this camera.","I almost didn't buy this camera, mostly because of some of the reviews posted here; the problems seemed targed to exactly what would bother me about it.  But I went ahead and bought it, only to discover that the problems didn't exist.<br />It is extremely easy to turn off the flash (just a touch of the obvious button with a flash sign on it), and the Ni-MH batteries that come with the accessory package work just swell.  I was also astonished at how long the batteries that came with the camera lasted and lasted and lasted.  Not a single problem transferring the pics to the puter, either.  I agree that more f-stops could come in handy, but the speed of the lens has worked terrific for me.  Shooting at 2.4 covers a lot of territory, and a lens like that for my Canon would cost me a fortune.  Come to think of it, it has cost me a fortune.  I find myself opting to underexpose shots (when the choice has to be made) because I can always recover a good deal of the \"lost info\" through Photoshop.  But once it's blow out, it's out.  I have to say that going back and reading some of these reviews, now that I have the camera, I'm wondering if I have the same camera as some of these other people:-)<br />All of the good points about this camera have pretty much been covered, so I won't spend time going over them.  I just want to put in my rave about how small it is, the angles available on the lens, and the mind-blowing prints that come out of my Epson 1270 printer.  The tonal range of the colors is so broad (much broader than I've been able to capture on silver halide) that I sometimes put a file through Adobe first, just to bring it down to what is usually expected.  I was very nervous when I bought this camera, thinking that the time for me to own a digital really hadn't come yet, but I was delightfully wrong about that.  Even if I weren't relying on this for professional reasons, I'd want it just for keeping family memories.  It is such a delight to be in a \"junk in, junk out\" photo enviornment, and not biting my nails until I'm in the darkroom to see if I caught what I thought I was catching.","I have owned this camera now for about 7 months now.  I use a Epson 850 printer with it.  I just love this thing.  It really works great, Pictures are out of this world.  Has a white ballance control which is so importanton digital cameras.  This means you can take color corrected pictures in a Gym, out doors, when clouds come out and indoors with incadencent lights.  It even does moview with sound.  Has many features my 35mm had too so I can take custom pictures.  Buy this camera, it is fun, easy to hold, and carry.  To make this work well I recommend buying these with it at the time of purchase: The olympus 64 meg scan disk not any other manuf.  You can do panormic only with oly.  Buy 8 Rechardable Energizer batteris high energy nic-net-hydride and charger, The olypus CLA1 41mm to 43mm conversion lens adapter, at 24.95 and the step uup ring 43 mm to 55mm , then get a 55mm UV haze filter and 55mm lens cap.  This way the lens on the camera can be protected, and you can add a polarizer filter for really great blue skys. Oh it also opens the door to more b day presents for other lenses olympus has.  Maybe Amazon will some day carry these items to make it all work.  The software that comes with the camera allows wonderful pictures and easy downloads via usb too.  you do not need any other software like other cameras.  I am really in the photography so I bought photoshop ver 5 as well.  I promise you will love this camera as much as I do,  Yes it is only rated number 2 now, but it really should be 1 for normal people like me.  If you are a pro the number 1 may fit, but price and features, this one you can operate without being a pro and get great pictures.  Bottom line buy it, You will be happy.","I have used this camera for one of my model shoots. Very surprisingly, at 40 by 30 inches poster print, the resolution is so sharp that tiny details such as the model's fine hair on the shoulders could still be seen! even when printed in 40 by 30 inches poster! Now this is something, the 135mm, nor i think the medium format can give. BTW, I used the SHQ format, which gives me abt 27 pic, on a 64 MB disk.<br />However, MANY problems were encountered when we were trying to retrieve the pics from the disk. We had specially bought a cable for the transfer of info, but, it seems that, the disk, or the cable is not very stable. Well, You might like me, get many problems when trying to get the pic out from the disk.<br />Such that even when we try to download the pic from the camera, it kept hanging.<br />But the abovementioned problem is or might be a problem with the PC, or (i suspect) the disk, of which i had three, the 16 MB, 32 MB, and 64MB one.<br />another shortcoming of the camera is the inabilty to switch off the flash feature. As during the shoot, when i try to take my model in low light situations, there is NO way i could turn the flash off, as it does not come with that feature, as it is either  in Flash mode or hotshoe to the lightings flash.<br />But overall, it gives gd results for a casual photographer.","I love this camera but it does NOT work with normal Ni-MH batteries like the book recommends.  The more expensive non-rechargable Lithiums like it comes with last a very long time.  Great picts too!<br />Customer service at Olympus however is EXTREMELY POOR!  I tried to call them regarding their recommended batteries not working (camera goes dead immediately - low batteries).  I was on hold (Daytime long distance rates!) for over an hour pushing a button every minute or so.  I finally hung up after listening to them tell me how valuable my time was.  So,I tried E-mail.  Got a great generic answer but not about my question.  So, I tried their web site.  It said Ni-MH batteries of 1300 mA or better work.  Mine are 1500 mA and don't.  So, I tried a response to their E-mail.  Yet another useless response that didn't even approach answering my question.  I tried to call them again and got the same crappy treatment again and hung up.  I tried E-mail again and got yet another useless response.<br />The bottom line is that I'll use the $10 each lithium batteries since I get about 250 shots from them.  I won't even attempt to use their support again.  Don't waste your time.  I really like the camera and its a shame that a company that makes such great products can't get a support department that can read or staffed to handle the volume of calls they must be getting.  Its no wonder they don't have a 1-800 number for support!","One of the major issues around Olympus digital imaging systems is, that they keep ignoring TWAIN as a standard for digital imaging. We had the C-21 and returned it because of the lack of support for W2K and Twain (i.e. no direct picture transfer into W2K or PhotoShop). Reading the reviews this is a general problem for all Olympus cameras except the E-10. Olympus does not intend to fix this. The consequence is that you need to buy additional transfer equipment, use additional software spending extra money and time on getting things achieved. Your option is thus the Nikon and Canon (S-20).","I've had my C3030 for months, now.  It's so small I can take it everywhere--and I do. With it, I've taken great shots of daily scenes in and around Miami, FL.  Having it makes street photography fun and easy.<br />As for the C3030's image quality, no other digital camera, in its price range, outdoes it. I went from a One Megapixel camera straight to the C3030.  Needless to say, the difference was astounding.  The large number of resolutions from which to choose really allow the photographer to shoot for any purpose--from email attachments, to Web pages, to professionally output hi-res images.  Usually, simply using the default resolution with the built in picture taking modes is right for any situation not requiring super hi-res output.  And it's easy.<br />I coupled my Olympus with an HP DeskJet 1220C.  Using the camera's default resolution, the printed output is guite good.  I can tell I haven't used the higher resolutions.  But my friends, who see the framed photos, usually think they came from a lab.<br />Of course I use Photoshop to help tweak the images until they look just as I want them to look.  But I really don't need to.<br />All in all, the C3030 is an excellent Camera.  The number of settings and menus is, at first, a bit daunting.  But spending some time to get to know the camera really unlocks its full potential.<br />If you want an excellent digital camera, with excellent image quality, easy to use default settings, and advanced features for even more flexibility, the C3030 is the one to get.","I had a hard time deciding between the Olympus 3030 and the Nikon 990. In the end, I choose the Olympus because of the option of sound on the movie feature. (I bought the camera to take pictures of a new addition to the family.) I really like how easy it is to take basic pictures. Family picture takers will like this camera. It takes great pictures, easy to transfer using USB, and comes bundled with great software. The camera is also very compact - its about the size of an average point and shoot.<br />The only thing that I would change about the camera is making the menu system more accessible. It is relatively easy to use, but I have not mastered making quick changes yet. A great addition would be a quick menu system in the top LCD area instead of having to power up the monitor. Or a button to quickly shift between some saved modes. You will also need to read the manual in order to really understand some of the features. They are not that intuitive for a Nikon SLR user...<br />If you are buying this camera, you should also get extra memory and batteries. You should also invest in either an external memory reader or the AC Power Adapter. I haven't tried rechargeables yet, but that may be my next purchase.","Being a tech geek, I did a bit of research on the various websites and narrowed my choices between the Olympus 3030 and Nikon 9090.  It seemed to be a toss up depending on which features you valued most.  I chose the Olympus for a variety of reasons and haven't regretted my decision.  First of all, the picture quality exceeded my expectations from the very first picture.  I've taken a variety of shots from the different settings and even with the \"avereage\" quality setting of images, the detail the camera picked up is unbelievable.  I've even zoomed in on the images with various photo editing programs and still can't detect any distortion.  Secondly, the installation of the provided software was a easy.  A nice bonus to the software was the supplying of Adobe Photoshop 5.0 LE, a slimmed down version of the very popular photo editing program that sets the industry standard for professional photo editing.  Third, Olympus provided a USB cable for downloading images from the camera to the PC, which speeds up the process tremendously when comparing it to a Serial transfer.<br />The few complaints I have concern more of the decisions of Olympus for what they provided instead of the overall quality of the camera.  First, why in the heck didn't they provide a charger and rechargable batteries?  Sure, they upgraded to Lithium batteries but this camera eats a lot of juice when using the LCD monitor.  And how about providing an AC adaptor for those times we want to download all our images or use the camera indoors.  Second, I had to go out and purchase a little lens cap strap since the cap isn't connected to the camera.  Having to place the cap in and out of my pocket when I want to take pictures is asking for the cap to be lost (especially when making the family trips to Disneyland).<br />Finally, the Olympus also uses the Smartmedia data storage and provides you with a 16MB card.  This isn't bad depending on what setting you have your camera on (the higher the quality, the less pictures you can take) but I would consider purchasing an additional memory card with a higher capacity.  As of this date, I believe the highest amount of MB that Smartmedia makes is 64Mb.  I know the Nikon uses the Compact Flash system and can go a as high as 128MB.  That's a feature to consider (well, the cost for a 128MB Compact Flash card runs on average is about $300).","This is my third digital camera.  It is excellent with no complaints.  The lithium batteries lasted about 250 pictures over 6 months.  Now NiMh are doing great.  The quality is super.  Downloads to PC easy.  You can't do better in this class.  I will be happy with this one for a long time.","I owned an Olympus D-500L for about 2 years and just upgraded to the C3030 Zoom.  Both camera's are AWESOME.  When I went looking for a newer, better, faster camera to replace the D-500L I fist went looking at Olympus and found the C3030Z to be rated the best.  Your rating system is right -- it has the best picture quality I've seen in a Digital Camera to date.<br />Buy it -- now!","I have not used this camera, rather the D360L.  However, when I upgraded to Windows ME (to take advantage of \"My Pictures\" and the built-in digital camera stuff), my camera wouldn't work.  It wasn't in the driver list, so I contacted Olympus.<br />This was my response (read - \"doesn't work - we're not doing anything abount it\")<br />\"The newer Olympus digital camera models -- D360L, D400Z, D450Z, D460Z,  D490Z, C2000Z, C2020Z, C211Z, C2500L, C3000Z, C3030Z, and the C21 -- are not designed to use twain drivers, plug-ins, or the mini-apps to  communicate with the computer.  The Olympus Camedia utility software  communicates with these camera models to download (copy) your picture  files into a folder on your computer harddrive where they can be  accessed by any software program that can use jpeg or tiff formatted  graphic files.  Only the following Olympus digital cameras are twain  compliant:  D200L, D220L, D300L, D320L, D340L, D340R, D500L, D600L, and  D620L.  Only the D200L and the D300L can not communicate using Camedia. \"","Make no mistake, this is a great camera. It takes good pictures in a variety of lighting situations. It has two problems; the first is that darn lens cap gets lost easily, the second is that the view through the viewfinder (not the LCD display) doesn't accurately represent the frame. Both can be solved (one with an elastic cord glued to the camera and one with practice) but they detract from an otherwise excellent product. I also like the ability to record a short audio segment on each picture, this is enough to describe the scene so that I can remember it later (try to remember everyone at your wedding for example!)","This is the Digital Camera you must have if you want outstanding photo quality. You can't tell the difference between prints from this camera and that of a good 35MM SLR. It's amazing. Be aware that this camera is only USB compatable if your PC has Windows98 and not the upgrade. Windows 95 users will need to purchase a floppy disc adapter for the smart media card in order to download pictures to a PC. A Serial Port Cable also works with Windows95. I had a Sony FD-91 Mavaca Digital before I bought this Olympus and the C-3030 has the Mavaca beat hands down. So if you want a digital camera that gives you by far the best print quality around then the expensive C-3030 digital is the one for you.","I had a Sony Mavaca FD-91 before I bought the Olympus. The FD-91 is good but the C-3030 is the best by far when it comes to photo print quality. You can hardly tell the difference between a print from this camera or a good 35mm slr camera. Although the camera is complicated to operate, once you read the very large operating manual it gets easier to operate. Be aware that this camera is only USB compatable when you have Windows98 and not the upgrade. If you have Windows95 you will have to buy the floppy disc adapter for the smart media card in order to download pictures to your PC. A serial port cable also works with Windows95. An optional 32MB media card is also a plus. If you have a good ink jet printer and want some excellent photos, then the Olympus C-3030 is worth the premium price you will pay for this feature loaded camera.","The Olympus C-3030 zoom is a high quality, professional camera that allows the photographer complete control over the exposure and the focus.  Much of my photography is done with a tripod and a hand held light meter and this camera allows me manual exposure control.  This and manual focus allows me to control the depth of field.  The only real drag is that there isn't a way to preview the depth of field.  I also purchased this camera because you can use an off-camera flash, but unfortunately, unlike the earlier models (c-2000 and c-2020) that used a regular pc socket, this camera has a special socket for use with a very expensive Olympus flash.  I gather that I can buy a special bracket that allows the use of other flashes, but why couldn't they have added a hotshoe to the camera?","After owning an Olympus 460 Zoom and now the Olympus C3030, I would honestly say that the quality is pretty much the same.  With both cameras, many indoor shots had be be \"doctored\" in Adobe Photoshop.  Levels need to be adjusted and then the photos are just great. Outdoor shots are great.  I did notice that battery life with the 3030 was considerably more than that of the 460. Rechargeable batteries are essential with any digital camera!  I really like the \"movie with sound\" function of the 3030.  Smart media reader buyers - beware if you have an AMD processor.  After much research I have found that a Pentium processor is essential and your reader may not work with an AMD. Camera appearance very professional looking.  For the true photographer, this camera is a must.  For the amateur the 460 works quite nicely.","This is a very nice camera.  I agree with Jim DuLaney on the  shutter delay of digital cameras.  I am use to the release on my Canon F-1 and A-1.  However, you can shoot again while the camera is still recording the image to the SmartMedia Card.<br />PLEASE NOTE:  \"Slopedirk\" (see his review) must not have used the owner's manual.  You most certainly can set your own default settings, such as your preferred resolution; whether you want flash or no flash; shutter priority or aperture priority, and the preferred setting; etc.<br />The menu selections are fairly simple once you play with the camera awhile.  As for the problem of taking the lens cap off before turning on the power - buy the extender tube (an Olympus accessory).  This tube is needed if you attach accessory lenses.  I find it very useful because it allows me to use a filter (Haze, UV, Skylight, etc.).  I leave it on at all times!<br />A good companion book for any digital camera: Digital Photography For Dummies®, by Julie Adair(find it at [amazon])... This is an excellent resource and also explains imaging software (Photoshop, etc.) and printing. (Don't let the title steer you away.  I don't usually like Dummy books; but a professional photographer even uses this book and highly recommends it!)","If you got the money, buy this camera. There are only someminors things you should be aware off: 1. As pointed out below, thelens cap does seem to have a precarious life without a strap, but youcan get one... at any camera store.  2. The 16MB smartcard that comeswith it, will only last you for 20 high resolution pictures, so Idefinitely recommend you invest in a 64MB card as soon as you purchasethe camera . 3.  The viewfinder displays about 20% less of the pictureof what you will actually take, depending on the zoom value, which canbe annoying when you want to make good framing. But I think this isendemic in non SLR cameras.<br />4. My camera for some reason refused toturn on after a week of using it. I sent it to Olympus (East Coast)for repair and they took forever to repair it...<br />5.What\"Slopedirk\" wrote below is not true. You can set the defaultresolution but its buried somewhere in the onscreen menus.","I won't repeat the positives listed in other reviews, but the main gripe of this camera for me is the need to have to access the menu to change  resolutions, as it will \"default\" to a pretty high res setting,  when most of my shots I really only need the lowest.  A knob would be a  much better way to handle this and some other settings.  I also personally  am a retro guy and would lose the motorized stuff, a nice lever would  suffice and save the batteries.  Same thing for flash, it goes off unless  you turn it off via a menu, and that can ruin a natual light picture if you  forget.  Too much automatic stuff for me to really feel \"as one\"  with this thing, but it does take outstanding pictures.<br />The pictures are  very good with this camera.  Software good, and with a big memory chip it  holds tons of pictures.  Have not tried the movie feature, but a small  speaker or headphone jack would be nice if you did this more than  occassionally.  Also the need to take off the lens cap to avoid motor/gear  damage upon powerup is a annoyance that might be costly to the  operator.<br />S","I've previously owned two digital cameras that I was not quite satisfied  with; this one is IT!!  It's simple to use in 'default' mode, but with the  shutter and aperture priority, the auto-bracketing, sequence mode, movies,  sound, panorama function, etc., it's a photographer dream.  If I had one  single complaint it would be the lack of a retaining strap on the lens cap.  Big deal.  If you had 6 stars, I'd freely give it that instead of the  paltry 5 I'm limited to.","I'll try not to repeat the rave reviews that others have given the Olympus  C3030 but I thought I would counter a couple comments I saw about a  supposedly flawed view finder, battery compartment flap, and the battery  for the remote control.  One person commented that it took him 15 minutes  to figure out the camera battery flap which he ended up breaking.  Without  reading the manual it took me no time at all to install 4 AA batteries and  I had the camera up and running immediately without a hitch - or breaking  anything.  There was nothing wrong with my remote control or the battery,  and camera view finder works as it should.  The one very minor flaw is that  if you power up the camera with the lens cap over the lens, the zoom lens  tries to push outward causing the a grinding sound.  Its happend to me a  couple times but didn't cause any damage and I'm more careful now to take  the lens cap off before powering up the camera.<br />This camera is awesome!  Others have written about its many featues and superb picture quality.  I  especially like the bonus of being able to make QuickTime videos.","This camera has incredible versatility.  It allows for many pixel  compressions of jpeg files, all of which are fine quality.  In the 1st 3  weeks, I have taken over 1,000 photos of nature, travel, people, and  objects.  It uses smartcards which are smaller than a matchbook cover and  the 32 meg smartcard allows 330 photos on the SQ2 down to 40 on the HQ  compression. I print on a Hewlett-Packard Office Jet 60R and the quality is  very close to 35mm enlargements from a color lab. I recommend using the  rechargeable batteries since they last many hours then take a quick  recharge.<br />I intend to use this camera to photograph mushrooms in our  forests this August and have total confidence in it. The macro button  allows the lens to be within inches of the subject, and with both manual  and digital zoom enabled, the subject fills the view.  The lens is fast  enough to use in dim light, but the flash is there when you need it.  The  accompanying software is easy to install, easy to use.<br />Caveats: it is  very complex and the accompanying manual is essential. I refer to the  manual daily.  Also, I find it hard to get accustomed to the shutter delay  of a digital cameras after using a Canon A-1 SLR for all these years.  I  should mention that  the 1 1/2 inch LCD monitor cannot be seen when in  direct sunlight, although is perfectly visible when in shadows.  The  biggest flaw is the lens cap which MUST be removed before power is turned  on, and CANNOT be in place while power is on, a very odd flaw, Olympus.","I got one with two obvious defects. I won't say what they are. But please check your camera carefully right now. Especially the viewfinder and the battery cap of the remote control to make sure they are clean and openable.","I have wanted a digital camera for a year and finally bought this one. I have never used one before... I simply opened the box put in the batteries and started taking pictures! Very impressive. It's so light weight you  would think its a toy. The only complaint I have is the lense cap HAS TO BE  OFF before you turn it on! I constantly turn it on without removing the  cap, it makes this horrible crunching gear grinding noise. It takes true  Olympus quality pictures! Very easy to upload without any extra purchase.  It dose need rechargeable batteries NiMh kind 2 sets. I love it!","I've had this camera for almost a month now, and I continue to be impressed by its capabilities.  The high resolution, multi-shot cache, 64 MB cards with panoramic option (Olympus smart media cards only) make this a  worthy companion to the old 35MM SLR camera.  If you're looking for a  quality product with all the control of a 35MM SLR, this is your camera.","I originally was waiting for the Nikon 950, but when I saw this beauty I snapped it up quick.  This camera has it all!  If your a novice photographer looking for a nice digital camera that takes profesional  quality photos, this is your camera.  If your an expert photographer and  are looking for a high-end digital camera that you can manipulate the  shutter speed, film speed or aperature as well as a wide variety of special  effects, this is your camera.<br />The 3030 has a very easy to use menu for  selecting all of your options, and you don't need a masters degree to  understand and operate it.  The camera is also very good on batteries!  I  personally use rechargable AA batteries and I have never had a problem.  another nice feature is the USB port, you can download your photos  ultra-fast from your camera to your computer.  The manual is very easy to  understand, I had no problems interpreting the instructions.  My only  complaint about the camera is the lens cap.  It can be easily lost as it  has no retention straps.  Also the lens zooms out upon turning on the  power, and you have better removed the lens cap first or risk stripping out  the gears in the lens.  But this is a minor issue. This camera also comes  with a 16meg memory card (most cameras come with 8meg) but I would  recommend the 32meg card, nothing worse than running out of memory!<br />If  you are looking for a high-end camera and don't mind shelling out about  $800, I would really consider this camera.","In my earlier review, I stated that one of the minor shortcomings of the Olympus C-3030 is that it lacks an \"integrated\" optical+digital zoom.  This was incorrect -- I simply misread the manual.  In fact, the  integrated zoom is one of the improvements of this model over its  predecessor, the C-2020.  So, all the better for the C-3030!","If you're looking for a 3.3 megapixel camera, you'll probably end up choosing from among the Olympus C-3030Z, the Nikon Coolpix 990, Sony DSC-S70 and the Canon PowerShot S70.  All are great products.  After  extensive research, I decided on the Olympus C-3030Z.<br />I suppose the  primary thing to look for in any camera, analog or digital, is image  quality.  In this regard, all of these cameras score very well.  People  seem to say that the Sony produces the sharpest pictures with the most  vivid -- but not necessarily most accurate -- color; the Canon's images are  good but tend to be on the \"cool\" side; and the Nikon and Olympus  are said to produce the most balanced and \"accurate\" images.  It  is hard to say which camera takes the \"best\" pictures: some  people prefer the razor-sharp look of the Sony images, while others find  the Olympus and Nikon images much more pleasing -- it's all a matter of  taste.  But basically, you are going to get superb pictures from any of  these cameras.  Personally, I thought the Olympus and Nikon produced the  most natural-looking and visually appealing images.<br />Image quality aside,  there are basically 3 reasons I chose the Olympus.  FIRST, it has a solid,  rugged feel and its black aluminum body fits naturally into your hand.  (The Coolpix's twist body is, well, cool -- but I found it awkward to hold,  and the Olympus is more compact.)  SECOND, the Olympus uses the tiny  \"SmartMedia\" flash memory card, which I prefer, simply because I  have another device that uses the same format.  (The Sony uses its  proprietary \"Memory Stick\"; the Nikon uses CompactFlash Type I;  and the Canon takes CompactFlash Type I/II, I think.)  THIRD, the Olympus  provides a large number of image resolution storage modes -- you can choose  any combination of picture size (2048x1536, 1600x1200, 1280x960,1024x768,  640x480) and compression level (uncompressed TIFF, jpeg high quality, jpeg  normal), for a total of 15 different combinations.  This flexibility  enables you to choose the resolution/compression appropriate to your  particular intended use of the images.  (By the way, you can fit about 20  images at 2048x1536, normal jpeg compression onto the supplied 16MB  SmartMedia card.)  FOURTH, the Olympus is very fast: quick power-up, very  little shutter \"lag\", and large memory buffer that makes a  \"burst\" or sequence mode possible.  FIFTH, the camera allows you  to make short (up to 3 minutes) movies, with audio.<br />I've had the camera  for about a week now, and I love it.  The pictures are astonishingly good,  and the camera has an intuitive menu system that makes it easy to use.  The  USB connection is a snap, although I use a SmartMedia card reader to  download pix to my computer.  A nice touch: the camera comes with an A/V  cable and a little wireless remote so you can hook it up to your TV, gather  everyone around and gawk at the pictures you just took!<br />All in all, I  feel I made the right choice with the Olympus.  My only criticisms: Olympus  should package this camera with rechargeable NiMH batteries, not the  lithium disposables it comes with; the LCD screen has a bit of a glare  problem in the outdoors; and the optical zoom isn't integrated with the  digital zoom (i.e., the camera doesn't automatically transition to digital  zoom when optical zoom \"runs out\") -- you have to access a menu  to switch from one to the other.  But these are very minor gripes.  I  recommend the Olympus C-3030Z without hesitation!","With an Olympus C3030 Digital Zoom Camera, I wonder how many pictures can be stored in a 32 MB SmartMedia Card?  I'm really interested in buying this camera.  Please let me know at wichean2514@hotmail.com","First -- this is a good camera.  The surprise is how fast the manual reads and how simple to follow the instructions are!  Who knew?<br />This is my first experience with a digital camera of any kind after 26 years in the  darkroom working in cold water -- and what a treat.  I can override the  shutter speed, the aperture or both and get the same effects as with my old  manual Nikon -- and do it in color, sepia, or black and white.  What's  more, the flash is versitile and easy to switch off for ambient light work  -- and even the fully automatic settings turn out some fine exposures.<br />It self corrects for florescent, tungsten, shade or sun -- it zooms  tight for close ups without requiring lots of extra lens purchases up front  -- it gives me enough flexibility in dpi / resolution that I can shoot 40  or 300 frames on a single disk -- and it's easy to download into my little  Mac iBook thanks to the included software -- it does everything I would  have on my wish list if I were making up this camera myself....<br />No  problems.  Just be sure and get extra Nimh batteries and lots of smartmedia  to play with.  I'm building  a toy store online with mine -- and the teddy  bears all love to have their picture made so I'm burning up those little  32mg disks....<br />fun fun fun!","I guess 2,048X1,536 is much more than enough for most of people. To have a reasonable image and file storage, I think 960*1200 is enough. Although you can adjust settings on this camera, you are likely to waste some money if  you don't really need the most cutting tech. this camera has. Anyway, I  love this terrific camera, even more than the new car I bought recently. :  )","I had the predecessor to this camera the 2020Z.  Great camera but I wanted audio capability.  Everything I liked about the 2020Z is here and more.  Its still compact (fits in pockets better than most), EASY on batteries,  excellent colors, fast lens (2020Z is faster), fast shot recovery, wireless  remote and very light weight.  The 3030Z expands on the 2020Z with one  lever zoom for both optical and digital modes, higher resolution (won't  gain you much on average size pictures), more control over power off and on  settings.  Some things that I do miss about the 2020Z are it's faster lens  and the ability to shot 30 frames per second in low resolution movie mode.  You do have a large memory buffer on the 3030Z so you can shoot 5 frames in  best resolution mode in a little over a second!  While no camera can yet do  it all this one comes very close.  I currently have an Olympus 2500L, 500L,  2020Z and Nikon Coolpix 950 and this is my favorite by far.<br />The only  things I would change on the 3030Z are: an incredibly close macro mode like  the 950/990 Nikon, standard NiMH batteries and charger like my 2020Z,  faster lens of the 2020Z (one of the fastest on a digital), 30 fps in all  movie modes as well as optical instead of digital zoom with movies and the  nifty little exposure histogram like on the high-end Nikons.  Those minor  quibbles aside it is an outstanding camera.  It doesn't eat batteries,  takes great pictures (not just great digital pictures) and is very fast  between shots and from the time your press the shutter to the shot is  actually taken.  If you have used a Kodak 280 or 290 you know how  aggravating it is to press the shutter and wait...wait... wait... until you  finally lose the once in a lifetime shot you actually wanted to take.<br />It  is tough to go wrong if you buy this camera.  It is not cheap but it is an  excellent value.  The \"boot up\" time of the camera is really quick too. If  you are willing to trade off a slightly smaller memory buffer for burst  mode and slightly less recording time in movies as well the Olympus 3000Z  is a good choice and you will save about $200.  One big plus often  overlooked is the software that comes bundled with the camera.  The  software included with the Nikon's is basic at best.  If you buy the 3030Z  you get Adobe Photoshop 5 LE which is an outstanding program that gives you  a lot of control over editing your images.  It may be the \"light\" version  of Photoshop but it is still incredibly powerful. This does NOT come with  the 3000Z though!  I think that is part of the pricing difference between  the two.  One other big plus about the Olmpus \"C\" series in general is that  you rarely get \"red eye\" when using the built in flash.  I can't seem to  avoid it on my Nikon 950 and my friend has the same problem on his Nikon  990.  The 3030Z does a great job in low light conditions without the flash  too.  Buy one, it's a great camera!","I bought a C3030 about a month ago. On both Program and A/S/M mode, the results have been oustanding ! I have printed upto Super A3 Size on an EPSON 1270 Stlylus Photo (Custom mode 1440dpi) and the details are  brilliantly enlarged. The Digital photo quality has certainly surpassed the  Film --- blue sky and shaded areas, colour and tone of every shot has  convinced me that I can now pack up my 35mm SLRs for good. No kidding,  you've gotta try and see to believe it. Since I bought mine, four of my  colleages bought the same thing. Although the Camera feels light, after two  days, one get easily adjusted to the wieght. Perhaps a little more wieght  and a bit of metal would have made it feel like a real replacement of a  35mm SLR. If you are looking for the best quality print out, I bet there is  hardly anything better than the EPSON Stylus Photo 870 or 1270 -- using 3  picolitres ink droplets, these Printers are also among the highest  resolution currently available in the market.","I've been waiting for this camera for a long time.  Small, compact, very easy to use.  The manual was a breeze to go through and the pictures, well what can I say.  I'm an advanced camera buff who loves to take photos of  just about anything and having this little one by my side---well move over  my dear old 35mm slr--you've been replaced.  I just recently ordered some  additional lens to go with this guy.  I did a wedding shoot last weekend  and the results---well most awsome!  And I didn't even use the highest  resolution!  I take the shots off the smartmedia and put them onto my Click  disk for permanent storage and printing.  Get this camera now!  Was a  toss-up between the Coolpix 990 and this one---glad I chose the Olympus  3030Z!","It is versatile, definitely.  It does so much, it is intimidating for the amatuer/novice (that's me!).  Takes awhile to get through the manual, which was easily followed and well illustrated.  The quality of the shots has  lived up to expectations.  Although it allows liberal manual adjustment, my  best work has been on the \"program/auto\" modes, where even then  you can \"tweak\" the results.  I tend to like macro shots and  portraits, but will taking it to Colorado soon.  Can't wait.  I am still on  the original batteries, although I try and not use the LCD screen too much.  Uploading the shots has not been a problem (I have a 450Mhz Pent 3).  Takes some getting use to the small size and light weight.  I am used to  35mm with some \"heft\".","snapshooter convenience, professional level images. easy to use in default, amazingly flexible(complicated) when you delve into features. lens seems a little fragile when extended, but linked optical/digital zoom with  one button improves greatly on c-2020, which i also have. this is my 5th  digital, and i love it. with large-gig laptop, and pcmcia card adapter,  it's easier than floppies."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S20","amazon_reviews":["I have one of these in my glove box and use it all the time.

The reason I insist on taking pictures in this mode is because it has a \"Fast Shutter\" setting, which is *absolutely* necessary for taking pictures of a baby with flailing limbs (or now, a constantly moving toddler).  I've also used it to get some great shots of fish zipping by in tanks at the aquarium.  It really DOES make a difference.<br />It is both a blessing and a curse that you must continue to depress the shutter button for a display of the picture you have just taken.  A blessing because if you don't WANT to see the picture, it doesn't waste the battery.  A curse because when you DO want to see the picture, you usually forget to hold the button down!

The instruction manual does not make that clear enough, and my camara was ruined after three months by a humid environment.  I can only say excellent camara, EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER RELATIONS BY CANON.  Fortunately for me, Amazon went to bat for me on this purchase, and I highly recommend ANY Amazon purchase.<br />In summation, GREAT camara (even at the $600 I paid, and the $400 price now), crappy customer service by Canon, and truely proffesional sales and support practices by Amazon.<br />JUST DON'T EVER LET THE CAMARA EXPERIENCE EVEN SLIGHT LEVELS OF HUMIDITY!!!!!!!!","My dad bought this camera just under a year ago and he bought the IBM 340mb micordrive and about 3 extra batteries(wise decision). I took it with me to Vancouver,BC  this summer and shot over 600 pictures in two weeks all on the superfine,large resolution and the quality surpases 35 mm film by fAR. You can fit over 1000 images on the lowest quality but on the highest you can fit around 90-100. Don't even think about using a digital camera any less than 128mb because you'll run out of room quickly. Although this is the first digital camera I have used, I am an experienced photographer and this camera simply makes taking pictures more relaxing and whats better is that you dont need to freak out if 90% of the photos you shot were useless. I used this camera at altitudes of 9000+feet and under very cold conditions and in total darkness as well as on the back of a motorcycle at 90 miles hour. I had used the camera many times prior but I was concerned with getting the most out of my pictures while on vacation so I utilized almost every mode and option on this camera.<br />Pros: -excellent quality during high speed photography even with low light -small, light, durable. I gave up carrying around a [price] nikon slr and a video camera for this baby. -stitch assist mode actually works great; basically it makes panoramas out of a series of pictures you shot. I used it for overlooking Stanley park, grousse mountain, and the totem poles in capilano as a test and I was amazed that it actually worked. Very easy too.<br />Cons: -Battery power is a major issue especially if you have a microdrive which i recommend for this camera if it is cheaper than a 5oomb flashcard; with the lcd screen off you can shoot maybe 90 pics and the highest resolution with the flash. My sister did it at a party 91shots in under 5 minutes and drained a fully charged battery.  -not really manual controls, you cant set aperature and shutter speed but use fast shutter, slow shutter, etc.<br />-flash is good indoors even in complete darkness but outdoors the range is severly limited to about 15 feet at most<br />I'm assuming if you are reading this you are doing a fair bit of research before buying so you've already encountered the same complaints about battery power and memory but really this camera has the same issues as most digital cameras so there arent any major problems specific to the s-20. Definately buy a microdrive or 500mb+ flashcard if possible but be sure of compatibility before spending some big bucks.","I see the average consumer having too primary needs for a digital camera. The first and most important in their mind is a tool to record those moments that need to last forever. This translates into a digital versus film because of the unparalled ability of digital to display the recorded image. These are the shots that include family and friends, everyday life. Other important factors in choosing a camera that will handle this aspect would be zoom and flash. From what I have seen of the performance of such a small camera, it does fine.<br />I can't wait until canon makes SLR rangefinder digital cameras similar to the s20, but with the option of extended zoom capability. That would be cool.<br />The second most important need that I can percieve is a camera that is portable enough that it is not a big deal to carry with you most of the time. This would be for those shots that the consumer says \"Oh that looks cool\". This camera fits the bill perfectly bieng the smallest on the market that is able to support a microdrive.<br />I think toshiba recently released a 5 gig mircodrive. I can't believe how many pictures this translates to. Of course it costs almost as much as the camera, but for people whom are serious about recording a moment in their life, then the investment in the camera / rechargeable batteries / leather case / microdrive goes without saying.<br />Hope this helps!","I have used this camera for the last 6 months to take pictures of vacations, family, friends, pets, scenery and most of all my new baby.  Before I bought a digital camera I would take maybe a roll of film's worth of pictures in a year.  Since I got the S20 I have taken a couple thousand.  It's truly liberating to take 10 pictures of a scene and pick the best one, everyone's eyes are open, the dog is not in the way, etc.<br />The S20 produces beautiful pictures, is simple to use and feels like a solid camera.  I have dropped it twice and it still works like a charm.  With a spare battery and a 128MB memory card I can take pictures all day long without a second thought.  The camera is a breeze to use.  My wife (who is not a technophile) easily thumbs through the menus and shows me the pictures of our baby that she has captured.<br />My only regret is that I waited until I could afford it, I wish I had put it on a credit card a sooner and gotten more pictures of my child's first few months.","WHILE THIS CAMERA TAKES DECENT PICS, THE BATTERY LIFE IS INEXCUSABLE. MY DURACELL LASTED 3 DAYS. THE ICONS, BUTTONS AND MENUS DO NOT COME NATURALLY. LEAVE IT TO CANON TO MAKE YOU BUY THE ESSENTIAL RECHARGABLE BATTERY SEPARATELY. FROM NOW ON I STAY WITH SONY. EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE AND THE BATTERY LASTS FOREVER.","I bought this camera from Amazon.com, and I've been using it since the day that it arrived, and I think the only negative thing about this camera is that it eat batteries like CRAZY, and so if you are going to buy this DC, I STRONGLY suggest that you also get the rechargeable battery kit which is also avalible on Amazon.com. This DC is very easy to use, and the manual explanes it all, and it's the smallest of it's kind (3.3 mp) so if you need a DC, this will be the one!","This is my 2nd digital cam and this one is so much better than my first.  It has so many more features(black & white, landscape, night scenes, stitching images, & continuous shooting to name a few) and it is user friendly.  Family back home have gotten spoiled by the pictures I email to them almost daily.  The pictures come out very clear, but you do have to take the time to make sure that you have it on the right settings.  The images download quickly and I love being able to view the slide show on the tv.  It makes it easy to show pictures that have just been taken, in better detail, to family that may not have a computer.This camera has been a lot of fun and I do not regret the purchase at all.<br />However,and this is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, I cannot get the editing software to work correctly and I was disappointed when I realized I was going to have to spend some more $ to get the supply kit. The supply kit is a must unless you have a room full of lithium batteries and even that wouldn't last you for long if you wanted to use this camera to its full capability. The software for downloading and saving the pictures is very easy to use.","Actual cost of this camera: ... Canon Powershot 20 ...  Canon Powersupply kit - power via a/c and recharge batteries ...  extra rechargeable battery (one in Powersupply kit) ... Sandisk 128meg compact flash memory ...  Canon case for camera ...  Camera bag Total ... ... - but the additional items are probably the same on other digital cameras. I did feel a little guilty spending the cash - but once this amazing piece of technology arrived I found that even I could take amazing pictures.  I was also impressed by the functions on the camera - like panoramic where you can take a series of photos and tie them together with the supplied software.  The result can be a sickening but cool 360 degree photo.  Read the manual in five minutes and you are off - plenty to experiment with for the novice with super results.  Downloading pictures via USB port - 10 seconds for like 20 of them.  No sweat.","The reviews on the S20 have influenced my decision to purchase,  BUT I hold a webcertificate with which I am planning to purchase the camera. US legislation prevents shipping outside the USA, so my intention is to have it shipped to my son in Houston who will eventually bring it to Australia.  Will I have difficulties using it in Australia due to different voltage?","after months of research, i finally bought this camera and it is very good.  i originally looked into the canon digital elph but eventually bought the s20<br />pros: 1) it's small size, though the elph is even smaller (the sales person slipped it into his shirt pocket and it fit like a pack of cigarettes) 2) great quality of pics, elph has lower resolution, but you won't be able to tell if you plan on posting your pics on the web...but you'll need the high resolutions for printing 3) the price is reasonable  4) uses rechargable battery (a must) or store bought batteries.  the digital elph uses only a specific size of rechargable batteries and can't take any store bought ones.  5) the camera's body is pretty sturdy, it had a minor incident with the sidewalk and it's a little scratched up but still in great shape 6) this isn't unique to the canon s20 alone but all digital cameras in general...digital photo printouts on photo papers don't last as long as pictures developed from traditional films (35mm).  don't use it for pictures that you plan on keeping for a long time (i.e. wedding, family portraits, baby pics, etc.)<br />cons: 1) this thing drains the battery so quickly!  must buy rechargable battery & kit,  2) an additional (bigger memory) CF card is a must unless you plan on taking only 11 pictures at high resolutions 3) canon makes this leather case for its powershot cameras that you can buy  but it really should just be included with the camera kit b/c you'll end up needing to buy some sort of a case to protect the camera<br />overall, i love this camera and have had a lot of fun taking pictures but it hasn't completely replaced my 35mm camera.","The Canon S20 is the perfect combination of simplicity, function, and high technology. The camera takes fantastic pictures that are consistently clear, ungrainy, and in focus, even in odd lighting conditions. The metering system is great, as is the autofocus and the telephoto; all work near-flawlessly.<br />The S20's greatest strengths is its simplicity and its size. Although it does not offer advanced features (such shutter-speed priority, full manual, etc.) that some of the Nikons and more expensive Canons do, even an inexperienced camera user (digital or not) will have no problem taking great photographs. All of the moderately complicated features on the Canon such as macro-mode, toggling the flash, and red-eye reduction are as easy as hitting a clearly labelled, obvious button. Additionally, the S20 is just like a \"regular old camera.\" There are no bizare swivling things like on the Nikons, and more importantly, the camera is small enough to fit easily in a small bag or large pocket.<br />Please note that in addition to the camera itself, you will have to buy the battery recharger and, unless you want to be limited to a few megs, an extra PC card which will both add some money to your purchase. Still, for the camera you get, the extra purchases are not a big deal.<br />Overall, a fantastic little camera. Look no further.","I originally bought this camera because of its size and the fact that I had a spare Microdrive lying around.  After using it for a few days, I realized that it is truly a beginner's camera.  There is little manual options and those that are there, are very \"dumbed down.\"  The resulting pictures from the 3.3 Megapixel CCD are extraordinary.  They are very sharp and crisp.  However, if you are taking pictures of objects further than about 5 ft. away, make sure there is ample lighting because the flash is sub-par.  The Microdrive and the power supply kit certainly add to the overall price of the product, but IMHO, are true necessities.  In conclusion, if you are a beginner and are looking for a simple, easy to use camera that takes great pictures, this is camera for you.  But if you are an intermediate user who would like to control his picture taking a little more than 'point-and-click', look elsewhere.","A Great Little Camera!  Makes good and clear pics.  I recommend the rechargeable battery and a larger memory card though.  I have a 96 mb card that will hold more pics than I can take on a battery charge.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the camera thus far...","I am the Information Services Director for a Company that has 8 remote sites on the East Coast.  I was asked to find a camera that can be used by 4 departments and at every site.  After researching I found the Powershot S20 and we have set it at the standard camera.  We use this camera everyday for events, building pictures and for our local access channel.<br />This camera is small, easy to use and when connect via the USB port, the download time to a PC is incredible.  The people who use this camera have never used a camera in their life, so having them come to me the next day and telling me how easy it is, was a great relief to me.<br />The only draw back to this camera is the battery, I highly suggest buying the charger kit for this camera for the added money, mostly because the battery that comes with it drained after the first two hours, and $20 for each new battery is really not worth it.","This little machine is wonderful . I really did not know much about photography before I had this camera . I bought it primary because I am a doctor and need it for have a record of important cases . It took me only to read the manual and a little practice in order to be able to acquire wonderful pictures of everything I want , with or without macro , in color or B/W... whatever... The resolution is perfect ; with the rechargeable battery you don't have to worry for power , ... in other words , I really can't imagine what else to ask for in a camera!!!!! It's just amazing!!!!!!I carry it wherever I may roam .","The Canon S20 is simply stellar.  It takes outstanding photos, yet is very easy to use.  Of equal importance, it is tiny, so you'll never have to leave it behind!  You simply can't go wrong with this handy, high-end digicam.","I echo the prior statements -- a fabulous midget-sized camera whose 3.3 megapixel photos allow you to trust all of your memories to it. So-so battery life.<br />In addition, I found that the camera was fairly easy to use. I was able to do the basic things -- take photos, change the resolution, erase, etc. -- on a first or second try. (Then I read the manual to figure out the advanced stuff.)<br />My only dislike of this camera is that its automatic whiteness settings aren't true to life: it's too blue. For example, light-skinned (caucasian and some asians) people's skin has a bluish tint to it. You can play around with the manual settings to get accurately colored photos, but it's a pain to adjust the whiteness for every single snapshot you want to take. The resulting discolorations can generally be fixed in Photoshop, of course, but having to do this for every photo is not ideal.<br />I had heard about the whiteness issues before I bought the camera and purchased it anyway. I'm glad I did; the resolution, its size, and overall quality are worth the slightly disappointing optical issues.","I looked at many models.  I really liked the 3.34MPixel resolution.  It is easy to turn out some really nice photos.  I haven't owned another digital camera, so it is difficult to judge battery life, however, many of the digitals do not have a way to turn off the LCD.  Doing so greatly enhances battery life.  Also, instead of the IBM 340Mb micro drive, try the SANS 256MB flash card.  It has much lower battery consumption and still holds 100-300 (in hi-res mode) photos depending upon compression settings.<br />Also, GET the battery charger kit!  It has a NiCad included.  I saved the original lithium as an emergency battery, plus I bought an additional NiCad.  It adds slightly to the price, but you get a really light weight camera that is difficult to top at any price.","Great optics, nice list of options.  Takes great pictures.  software bundle is good.  Problem is the battery.  You get one of the ... throw-aways, which lasts about 45 minutes.  The rechargeable battery pack is ..., which is ABSOLUTELY NECCESSARY for this camera, so consider the price to be ... more than the going price.  Also, the rechargeable batteries last a bit under an hour.  You'll also want to get a bigger memory card.  Using the highest resolution, lowest compression takes some great pictures, and you'll want a big card to take lots of pictures.","I love this camera!  It takes very clear pictures and is very easy to use!  I did have to upgrade my printer so keep this in mind when you buy a digital camera.  I purchased the HP 932C through Amazon and it works great !  Excellent pictures and I use the camera also to take pics for my auctions and it is 100% quicker!  This is an excellent camera at a great price.  I like it also because it is so small too.","Sometimes when I take a shot, and get it to my PC I look at it and wonder, how such a samll unit can crete such clean pictures.<br />For most  applications the S10 will do but the S20 is good value still.","I love this camera. It is the smallest 3.3mp camera on the market and takes incredible pictures. The best part about this camera is its ability to take both type 1 and type 2 cf cards. This means that the S20 can use  the IBM Microdrive (170 or 340 mb). With the 340 mb drive (@$400, with  pcmcia card adapter), the camera can hold 379 shots at largest size with  medium resolution, or 164 shots at largest size with best resolution. I  literally shoot all day and sort the pictures out later. No more asking  yourself, \"should I take this shot, or will I fill the card too  quickly.\" If you are not going to buy the microdrive, I really don't  see the need to pay $800 for this camera. Its like buying a rolls royce and  getting bicycle tires. Also, be aware that the S20 takes a proprietary  battery (cannot be replaced by regular batteries in a pinch). When you buy  the camera, buy at least one extra battery that day. Nothing is worse than  having 150 shots left, but a dead battery. I love my S20, but be aware that  after the camera, charger, 340mb microdrive and an extra battery, you are  talking about $1350.","It's small, light and easy to use and picture quality is superb. I would agree with the other reviewers on this page with one exception: according to one reviewer you can't check the quality of your photo immediately after  shooting - this is not true: keep the shutter button pressed in after  shooting and the photo appears on the TFT screen until you release the  button. The supplied 16Mb flash card is not enough for efficient use, but  it does get you started. You can take 44 photos in medium res (1024 x 768)  which is good enough quality for screen viewing. Batteries will last long  enough to fill the 16 Mb card but I bought 2 extra rechargables with mine  and I keep TFT screen and flash use to a minimum when not near a power  supply. My biggest niggle with the Canon is that in Auto mode it only takes  pictures in the highest resolution, something like 8 or 9 photo's on the 16  Mb card. With maybe a 170 or 340 Mb IBM micro drive and a couple of extra  rechargable batteries this is a brilliant little machine suitable for most  users, takes great pictures and fits in your jacket pocket too!","I have been looking at digital cameras for the past year, The prices just couldn't be justified for me... Until the 3million megapixel camera's came out.  This isn't the right camera for professional shooting, as it does not  take raw tiff's.. but the large superfine Jpeg's turn out close enough to  raw images. This is a high end Point and Shoot camera, you do not need  professional photography experience to take great photos. The camera is  small and lightweight.. similar to the Canon ELPH camera's design.. so it  can slide in your pocket.. And Canon has been known for their optics for  years.  The software works fine, I just use Adobe Photoshop to get my  images though.  The photostiching is neat, and works well, I took pictures  in a circle around my apartment and stitched them seamlessly together to  make a really wide panoramic shot.. using USB to get your images is FAST, I  had no problems setting the camera up with USB or Serial.  The cons of this  camera is that it doesn't come with rechargable batteries (a MUST have) get  the recharge/ac adaptor kit, or else you will spend hundreds on batteries.  the 16MB CF card will fit about 100 average quality photo's, 34 above  average, but only 7 SuperFine quality photo's (time to go buy a bigger CF  card).. Digital camera's are going to be expensive, especially if you want  quality and features, The higher end Kodak's, Sony's and Olympus's offer  about the same features and quality, but the Kodak and Sony are much larger  and bulkier.  If you've used Canon camera's before, this will be simple to  use","I picked up this camera to do a web catalog photo shoot of flowers. I found it to be an impressive camera for its size. Get the IBM Microdrive because the 3 megapixel images will fill up a memory card fast!<br />Battery  life was good but it uses a proprietary battery. It also takes 2CR5s but  eats them up in a hurry.<br />Very good image quality, works well in macro  mode. One thing I wish it had is the ability to review the image right  after you took it. You can't do it easily, you have to switch camera modes  and the lens closes up. With the microdrive you can afford to take extra  shots and weed out the bad ones later.<br />Good transfer software although  the serial cable mode is incredibly slow...go with USB.<br />All in all, I  love this little camera which packs a punch."]},{"name":"Casio QV-3000EX","amazon_reviews":[]}]
